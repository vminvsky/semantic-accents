{"title":"Lion_Capital_of_Ashoka","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lion_Capital_of_Ashoka","summary":"The Lion Capital of Ashoka  is the capital, or head, of a column erected by the Mauryan emperor Ashoka in Sarnath, India, c. 250 BCE. Its crowning features are four life-sized lions set back to back on a  drum-shaped abacus. The side of the abacus is adorned with wheels in relief, and interspersing them, four animals, a lion, an elephant, a bull, and a galloping horse follow each other from right to left. A bell-shaped lotus forms the lowest member of the capital, and the whole 2.1 metres (7 ft) tall, carved out of a single block of sandstone and highly polished, was secured to its  monolithic column by a  metal dowel. Erected after Ashoka's conversion to Buddhism, it commemorated the site of Gautama Buddha's first sermon some two centuries before.\nThe capital eventually fell to the ground and was buried. It was excavated by the Archeological Survey of India (ASI) in the very early years of the 20th century. The excavation was undertaken by F. O. Oertel in the ASI winter season of 1904–1905. The column, which had broken before it became buried, remains in its original location in Sarnath, protected but on view for visitors. The Lion Capital was in much better condition, though not undamaged. It was cracked across the neck just above the lotus, and two of its lions had sustained damage to their heads. It is displayed not far from the excavation site in the Sarnath Museum, the oldest site museum of the ASI.\nThe lion capital is among the first group of significant stone sculptures to have appeared in South Asia after the end of the Indus Valley Civilisation 1,600 years earlier. Their sudden appearance, as well as similarities to Persepolitan columns of Iran before the fall of the Achaemenid Empire in 330 BCE, have led some to conjecture an eastward migration of Iranian stonemasons among whom the tradition of naturalistic carving had been preserved during the intervening decades. Others have countered that a tradition of erecting columns in wood and copper had a history in India and the transition to stone was but a small step in an empire and period in which ideas and technologies were in a state of flux. The lion capital is rich in symbolism, both Buddhist and secular.\nIn July 1947, Jawaharlal Nehru, the interim prime minister of India, proposed in the Constituent Assembly of India that the wheel on the abacus be the model for the wheel in the centre of the Dominion of India's new national flag, and the capital itself without the lotus the model for the state emblem.  The proposal was accepted in December 1947.","content":"#History\n#Excavation and display\n#Description\n#Symbolism\n#Influences\n#Legacy\n#Reconstructions\n#Related sculpture\n#Notes\n#References\n#Cited works\n#Further reading\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Double_Asteroid_Redirection_Test","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Double_Asteroid_Redirection_Test","summary":"Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) was a NASA space mission aimed at testing a method of planetary defense against near-Earth objects (NEOs). It was designed to assess how much a spacecraft impact deflects an asteroid through its transfer of momentum when hitting the asteroid head-on. The selected target asteroid, Dimorphos, is a minor-planet moon of the asteroid Didymos; neither asteroid poses an impact threat to Earth, but their joint characteristics made them an ideal benchmarking target. Launched on 24 November 2021, the DART spacecraft successfully collided with Dimorphos on 26 September 2022 at 23:14 UTC about 11 million kilometers (6.8 million miles; 0.074 astronomical units; 29 lunar distances) from Earth. The collision shortened Dimorphos' orbit by 32 minutes, greatly in excess of the pre-defined success threshold of 73 seconds. DART's success in deflecting Dimorphos was due to the momentum transfer associated with the recoil of the ejected debris, which was substantially larger than that caused by the impact itself.\nDART was a joint project between NASA and the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. The project was funded through NASA's Planetary Defense Coordination Office, managed by NASA's Planetary Missions Program Office at the Marshall Space Flight Center, and several NASA laboratories and offices provided technical support. The Italian Space Agency contributed LICIACube, a CubeSat which photographed the impact event, and other international partners, such as the European Space Agency (ESA), and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), are contributing to related or subsequent projects.","content":"#Mission history\n#Description\n##Spacecraft\n###Camera\n###Solar arrays\n###Antenna\n###Ion thruster\n##Secondary spacecraft\n##Effect of the impact on Dimorphos and Didymos\n##Observations of the impact\n##Follow-up mission\n##AIDA mission architecture\n#Mission profile\n##Target asteroid\n##Preflight preparations\n##Launch\n##Transit\n##Course of the impact\n###Sequence of operations for impact\n#Gallery\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

He led the Wagner Group, a private military company, and was a close confidant of Russian president Vladimir Putin until launching a rebellion in June 2023. Prigozhin was sometimes referred to as \"Putin's chef\" because he owned restaurants and catering businesses that provided services to the Kremlin. Once a convict in the Soviet Union, Prigozhin controlled a network of influential companies whose operations, according to a 2020 investigation, were \"tightly integrated with Russia's Defence Ministry and its intelligence arm, the GRU\".\nIn 2014, Prigozhin reportedly founded the Wagner Group to support pro-Russian paramilitaries in Ukraine. Funded by the Russian state, it played a significant role in Russia's invasion of Ukraine and supported Russian interests in Syria and in Africa. In November 2022, Prigozhin acknowledged his companies' interference in United States elections. In February 2023, he confirmed that he was the founder and long-time manager of the Internet Research Agency, a Russian company running online propaganda and disinformation campaigns.\nPrigozhin's companies and associates, and formerly Prigozhin himself, are subject to economic sanctions and criminal charges in the United States and the United Kingdom. In October 2020, the European Union (EU) imposed sanctions against Prigozhin for his financing of the Wagner Group's activities in Libya. In April 2022, the EU imposed further sanctions on him for his role in the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The FBI offered a reward of up to $250,000 for information leading to Prigozhin's arrest.\nPrigozhin openly criticized the Russian Defense Ministry for corruption and mishandling the war against Ukraine. Eventually, he said the reasons they gave for invading were lies. On 23 June 2023, he launched a rebellion against the Russian military leadership. Wagner forces captured Rostov-on-Don and advanced toward Moscow. The rebellion was called off the following day, and the criminal charges against Prigozhin were dropped after he agreed to relocate his forces to Belarus. On 23 August 2023, exactly two months after the rebellion, Prigozhin was killed along with nine other people when a business jet crashed in Tver Oblast, north of Moscow. The Wall Street Journal cited sources within the US government as saying that the crash was likely caused by a bomb on board or \"some other form of sabotage\". Since then, researchers and other analysts have reached the conclusion that an on-board bomb or explosive likely downed the plane.","content":"#Early life and education\n##Criminal history and imprisonment\n#Early career and rise to prominence\n#Wagner Group\n##Russian invasion of Ukraine\n##Conflict with Russian Ministry of Defense\n##Prigozhin as a populist critic\n##June 2023 rebellion\n#Africa interests\n#Internet Research Agency\n##Spin-offs\n#International sanctions\n#U.S. criminal charges\n#Financial support for Maria Butina in 2019\n#Personal life\n#Death\n#Awards\n#Memorials\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Andrew_Jackson","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Andrew_Jackson","summary":"Andrew Jackson  (March 15, 1767 – June 8, 1845) was the seventh president of the United States, serving from 1829 to 1837. Before his presidency, he gained fame as a general in the U.S. Army and served in both houses of the U.S. Congress. Often praised as an advocate for ordinary Americans and for his work in preserving the union of states, Jackson has also been criticized for his racial policies, particularly his treatment of Native Americans.\nJackson was born in the colonial Carolinas before the American Revolutionary War. He became a frontier lawyer and married Rachel Donelson Robards. He briefly served in the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate, representing Tennessee. After resigning, he served as a justice on the Tennessee Superior Court from 1798 until 1804. Jackson purchased a property later known as the Hermitage, becoming a wealthy planter who owned hundreds of African American slaves during his lifetime. In 1801, he was appointed colonel of the Tennessee militia and was elected its commander. He led troops during the Creek War of 1813–1814, winning the Battle of Horseshoe Bend and negotiating the Treaty of Fort Jackson that required the indigenous Creek population to surrender vast tracts of present-day Alabama and Georgia. In the concurrent war against the British, Jackson's victory at the Battle of New Orleans in 1815 made him a national hero. He later commanded U.S. forces in the First Seminole War, which led to the annexation of Florida from Spain. Jackson briefly served as Florida's first territorial governor before returning to the Senate. He ran for president in 1824. He won a plurality of the popular and electoral vote, but no candidate won the electoral majority. With the help of Henry Clay, the House of Representatives elected John Quincy Adams in a contingent election. Jackson's supporters alleged that there was a \"corrupt bargain\" between Adams and Clay and began creating their own political organization that would eventually become the Democratic Party.\nJackson ran again in 1828, defeating Adams in a landslide. In 1830, he signed the Indian Removal Act. This act, which has been described as ethnic cleansing, displaced tens of thousands of Native Americans from their ancestral homelands east of the Mississippi and resulted in thousands of deaths. Jackson faced a challenge to the integrity of the federal union when South Carolina threatened to nullify a high protective tariff set by the federal government. He threatened the use of military force to enforce the tariff, but the crisis was defused when it was amended. In 1832, he vetoed a bill by Congress to reauthorize the Second Bank of the United States, arguing that it was a corrupt institution. After a lengthy struggle, the Bank was dismantled. In 1835, Jackson became the only president to pay off the national debt. He survived the first assassination attempt on a sitting president. In one of his final presidential acts, he recognized the Republic of Texas.\nAfter leaving office, Jackson supported the presidencies of Martin Van Buren and James K. Polk, as well as the annexation of Texas. Jackson's legacy remains controversial, and opinions on his legacy are frequently polarized. Supporters characterize him as a defender of democracy and the Constitution, while critics point to his reputation as a demagogue who ignored the law when it suited him. Scholarly rankings of presidents historically rated Jackson's presidency as above average. Since the late 20th century, his reputation declined, and in the 21st century his placement in rankings of presidents fell.","content":"#Early life and education\n#Revolutionary War\n#Early career\n##Legal career and marriage\n##Early public career\n##Planting career and slavery\n##Duel with Dickinson and adventure with Burr\n#Military career\n##War of 1812\n###Creek War\n###Battle of New Orleans\n##First Seminole War\n#Presidential aspirations\n##Election of 1824\n##Election of 1828 and death of Rachel Jackson\n#Presidency (1829–1837)\n##Inauguration\n##Reforms and rotation in office\n##Petticoat affair\n##Indian Removal Act\n##Nullification crisis\n##Bank War and Election of 1832\n###Bank veto\n###Election of 1832\n###Removal of deposits and censure\n###Panic of 1837\n##Physical assault and assassination attempt\n##Slavery\n##Foreign affairs\n##Judiciary\n##States admitted to the Union\n#Later life and death (1837–1845)\n#Personal life\n##Family\n##Temperament\n##Religious faith\n#Legacy\n#Writings\n#Notes\n#References\n#Bibliography\n##Biographies\n##Books\n##Journal articles and dissertations\n##Primary sources\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

Votes were counted and the result was declared on 4 June to form the 18th Lok Sabha. On 7 June 2024, Prime Minister Narendra Modi confirmed the support of 293 MPs to Droupadi Murmu, the president of India. This marked Modi's third term as prime minister and his first time heading a coalition government, with the Telugu Desam Party of Andhra Pradesh and Janata Dal (United) of Bihar emerging as two main allies.\nMore than 968 million people out of a population of 1.4 billion people were eligible to vote, equivalent to 70 percent of the total population. 642 million voters participated in the election; 312 million of these were women, the highest ever participation by women voters. This was the largest-ever election, surpassing the previous election, and lasted 44 days, second only to the 1951–52 Indian general election. The legislative assembly elections in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Odisha, and Sikkim were held simultaneously with the general election, along with the by-elections for 25 constituencies in 12 legislative assemblies.\nIncumbent prime minister Narendra Modi, who completed a second term, ran for a third consecutive term. His Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had enjoyed an absolute majority—a minimum of 272 seats—in the 2014 and 2019 elections. The primary opposition was the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA), a coalition formed in 2023 by the Indian National Congress (INC) and many regional parties. The election was criticised for lack of action on hate speeches by Modi's BJP, reported electronic voting machine (EVM) malfunctioning, and suppression of political opponents of the BJP.\nOpinion surveys of mainstream media outlets projected a decisive victory for the BJP and its coalition, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). However, the BJP won 240 seats, down from the 303 it had secured in 2019, and lost its singular majority in the Lok Sabha, although the NDA overall secured 293 of the house's 543 seats. The INDIA coalition outperformed expectations, securing 234 seats, 99 of which were won by the Congress, garnering the party the official opposition status for the first time in 10 years. Seven independents and ten candidates from non-aligned parties also won seats in the Lok Sabha.","content":"#Background\n##Contemporary politics and previous elections\n##Electoral system\n##Planning\n#Schedule\n##Date summary\n##Seat summary\n#Parties and alliances\n##National Democratic Alliance (NDA)\n##Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA)\n##Other notable parties and alliances\n#Candidates\n##National Democratic Alliance\n##Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance\n#Major election issues\n##Unemployment\n##Ram Mandir consecration ceremony and sectarianism\n##Electoral Bonds\n#Party campaigns\n##Bharatiya Janata Party\n##Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance\n###Indian National Congress\n####Crowdfunding\n####Funding issues\n###Communist Party of India (Marxist)\n###Rashtriya Janata Dal\n###Aam Aadmi Party\n###Shiv Sena\n##Party manifestos\n###Bharatiya Janata Party\n###Indian National Congress\n#Misinformation\n#Surveys and polls\n##Opinion polls\n##Exit polls\n#Voting\n##Incidents\n##Voter turnout\n#Results\n##By alliance and party\n##By region\n##By state or union territory\n#Aftermath\n#Reactions\n##International\n##Stock markets\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Christianization","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Christianization","summary":"Christianization (or Christianisation) is a term for the specific type of change that occurs when someone or something has been or is being converted to Christianity. Christianization has, for the most part, spread through missions by individual conversions, but has also, in some instances, been the result of violence by individuals and groups such as governments and militaries. Christianization is also the term used to designate the conversion of previously non-Christian practices, spaces and places to Christian uses and names. In a third manner, the term has been used to describe the changes that naturally emerge in a nation when sufficient numbers of individuals convert, or when secular leaders require those changes. Christianization of a nation is an ongoing process.\nIt began in the Roman Empire when the early individual followers of Jesus became itinerant preachers in response to the command recorded in Matthew 28:19 (sometimes called the Great Commission) to go to all the nations of the world and preach the good news of the gospel of Jesus. Christianization spread through the Roman Empire and into its surrounding nations in its first three hundred years. The process of Christianizing the Roman Empire was never completed, and Armenia became the first nation to designate Christianity as its state religion in 301.\nAfter 479, Christianization spread through missions north into western Europe. In the High and Late Middle Ages, Christianization was instrumental in the creation of new nations in what became Eastern Europe, and in the spread of literacy there. In the modern era, Christianization became associated with colonialism, which, in an almost equal distribution, missionaries both participated in and opposed. In the post-colonial era, it has produced dramatic growth in China as well as in many former colonial lands in much of Africa. Christianization has become a diverse, pluralist, global phenomenon of the largest religion in the world.","content":"#Missions\n#Individual conversion\n##Baptism\n##Eucharist\n##Confirmation\n#Places and practices\n##Temple conversion within Roman Empire\n##Temple and icon destruction\n##Other sacred sites\n#Nations\n##Roman Empire to Early Middle Ages (1 to 800)\n###Christianization without coercion\n###Constantine and the goal of Christianization\n###Albanians\n###Germanic conversions\n####Frankish Empire\n###Christianization with coercion under Justinian I\n##Ireland\n##Great Britain\n##Italy\n##Greece\n##Caucasian Albania\n##Armenia, Georgia, Ethiopia and Eritrea\n##A seismic moment on the Iberian Peninsula\n##Europe and Asia of the High and Late Middle Ages (800 to 1500)\n###Language and literature\n##Bulgaria\n##Serbia\n##Croatia\n##Bohemia\/Czech lands\n##Poland\n##Hungary\n##Scandinavia (Sweden, Norway and Denmark)\n##Romania\n##Northern crusades\n##Lithuania\n##Kievan Rus'\n##Iberian Reconquista\n#Early colonialism (1500s–1700s)\n##Disease\n##Spanish and Portuguese India, Mexico and the Americas\n##French Canada, North America, west Africa and the West Indies\n##Dutch Indonesia, South Africa, Curaçao, New Guinea\n##British North America, Australia, New Zealand, Asia and Africa\n###In the United States\n#Africa (19th to 21st centuries)\n##Zaire\n##Tanzania\n##Other countries\n#Decolonization\n#Global Christianization\n##China\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

It is produced by Eduardo Verástegui, who also plays a role in the film. The plot centers around Ballard's Operation Underground Railroad, an anti-sex trafficking organization.

{"title":"University_College_London","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/University_College_London","summary":"University College London (branded as UCL) is a public research university in London, England. It is a member institution of the federal University of London, and is the second-largest university in the United Kingdom by total enrolment and the largest by postgraduate enrolment.\nEstablished in 1826 as London University (though without university degree-awarding powers) by founders inspired by the radical ideas of Jeremy Bentham, UCL was the first university institution to be established in London, and the first in England to be entirely secular and to admit students regardless of their religion. It was also among the first university colleges to admit women alongside men in 1878, two years after University College, Bristol. Intended by its founders to be England's third university, politics forced it to accept the status of a college in 1836, when it received a royal charter and became one of the two founding colleges of the University of London, although it achieved de facto recognition as a university in the 1990s and formal university status in 2023. It has grown through mergers, including with the Institute of Ophthalmology (in 1995), the Institute of Neurology (in 1997), the Royal Free Hospital Medical School (in 1998), the Eastman Dental Institute (in 1999), the School of Slavonic and East European Studies (in 1999), the School of Pharmacy (in 2012) and the Institute of Education (in 2014).\nUCL has its main campus in the Bloomsbury area of central London, with a number of institutes and teaching hospitals elsewhere in central London and has a second campus, UCL East, at Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in Stratford, East London. UCL is organised into 11 constituent faculties, within which there are over 100 departments, institutes and research centres. UCL operates several museums and collections in a wide range of fields, including the Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology and the Grant Museum of Zoology and Comparative Anatomy, and administers the annual Orwell Prize in political writing. In 2022\/23, UCL had a total income of £1.93 billion, of which £527 million was from research grants and contracts. The university generates around £10 billion annually for the UK economy, primarily through the spread of its research and knowledge (£4 billion) and the impact of its own spending (£3 billion).\nUCL is a member of numerous academic organisations, including the Russell Group and the League of European Research Universities, and is part of UCL Partners, the world's largest academic health science centre. It is considered part of the \"golden triangle\" of research-intensive universities in southeast England. UCL has publishing and commercial activities including UCL Press, UCL Business and UCL Consultants.\nUCL has many notable alumni, including the founder of Mauritius, the first Prime Minister of Japan, one of the co-discoverers of the structure of DNA, and the members of Coldplay. UCL academics discovered five of the naturally occurring noble gases, discovered hormones, invented the vacuum tube, and made several foundational advances in modern statistics. As of 2024, 32 Nobel Prize winners and three Fields medallists have been affiliated with UCL as alumni or academic staff.","content":"#History\n##1826 to 1836 – London University\n##1836 to 1900 – University College, London\n##1900 to 1976 – University of London, University College\n##1976 to 2005 – University College London\n##From 2005\n#Campus and locations\n##Bloomsbury\n##UCL East\n##Other sites\n##Student housing\n##Environmental initiatives\n#Organisation and administration\n##Governance\n##Faculties and departments\n##Finances\n##Terms\n##Logo and colours\n##Memberships, affiliations and partnerships\n#Academic profile\n##Research\n###Research centres\n###Publishing and commercialisation\n##Libraries\n###Special collections\n##Museums\n##Reputation and rankings\n#Admissions\n##Widening access\n#Student life\n##Students' union\n##Faith\n##Sport\n##Mascot\n##Rivalry with King's College London\n##Student campaigns\n#Student body\n##Diversity\n#Notable people\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n##Further reading\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"2022–2023_mpox_outbreak","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2022–2023_mpox_outbreak","summary":"In May 2022, the World Health Organization (WHO) made an emergency announcement of the existence of a multi-country outbreak of mpox, a viral disease then commonly known as \"monkeypox\". The initial cluster of cases was found in the United Kingdom, where the first case was detected in London on 6 May 2022 in a patient with a recent travel history from Nigeria where the disease has been endemic. On 16 May, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) confirmed four new cases with no link to travel to a country where mpox is endemic. Subsequently, cases have been reported from many countries and regions. The outbreak marked the first time mpox had spread widely outside Central and West Africa. The disease had been circulating and evolving in human hosts over several years before the outbreak and was caused by the clade IIb variant of the virus.\nOn 23 July 2022, the Director-General of WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), stating that \"we have an outbreak that has spread around the world rapidly, through new modes of transmission, about which we understand too little\". A global response to the outbreak included public awareness campaigns in order to reduce spread of the disease, and repurposing of smallpox vaccines. \nIn May 2023, the World Health Organization declared an end to the PHEIC, citing steady progress in controlling the spread of the disease.\nRelatively low levels of cases continued to occur, and as of 25 August 2024, there have been a total of 103,446 confirmed cases and 225 deaths in 121 countries.\nMpox is a viral infection that manifests a week or two after exposure with fever and other non-specific symptoms, and then produces a rash with lesions that usually last for 2–4 weeks before drying up, crusting and falling off. While mpox can cause large numbers of lesions, in this outbreak some patients experience only a single lesion in the mouth or on the genitals, making it more difficult to differentiate from other infections. In previous outbreaks, 1–3 per cent of people with known infections had died (without treatment). In the 2022–2023 outbreak the rate of death was less than 0.2 percent. Cases in children and immunocompromised people are more likely to be severe.\nMpox spreads through close, personal, often skin-to-skin contact. The disease can spread through direct contact with rashes, or body fluids from an infected person, by touching objects and fabrics that have been used by someone with mpox or through respiratory secretions. Given the unexpected and vast geographical spread of the disease, the actual number of cases is likely to be underestimated. While anyone can get mpox, the majority of confirmed cases outside of the endemic regions in Africa occurred in young or middle-aged men who have sex with men (MSM) who had recent sexual contact with new or multiple partners. On 28 July 2022, the WHO Director-General advised MSM to limit exposure by reducing the number of sexual partners, reconsidering sex with new partners, and maintaining contact details to allow for epidemiological follow-up. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has emphasized the importance of reducing stigma in communicating about the demographic aspects of mpox, specifically with regards to gay and bisexual men.\nA new outbreak of a different variant of mpox began in 2023 and was declared a PHEIC in August 2024.","content":"#Background\n##Emergency preparedness prior to outbreak\n##Endemic mpox in Africa\n#Outbreak characteristics\n##Phylogenetics\n##Long incubation periods\n##Mild clinical manifestations\n##Fear of zoonotic spread\n#Chronology\n##Deaths outside of Africa\n#Transmission\n##Transmission patterns\n##Wastewater surveillance\n#Interventions\n##Testing and containment\n##Vaccination\n#Social aspects\n##Misinformation\n#Responses\n##World Health Organization\n##Countries\n##Dependent territories\n#Cases per country and territory\n##Timeline of first confirmed cases by country or territory\n##Timeline of suspected cases by country or territory\n##Timeline of first deaths by country or territory (in countries with initial 2022 detection from 6 May onwards)\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}
{"title":"Bucha_massacre","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bucha_massacre","summary":"The Bucha massacre (Ukrainian: Бучанська різанина, romanized: Buchanska rizanyna; Russian: Резня в Буче, romanized: Reznya v Buche) was the mass murder of Ukrainian civilians and prisoners of war by the Russian Armed Forces during the fight for and occupation of the city of Bucha as part of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Photographic and video evidence of the massacre emerged on 1 April 2022 after Russian forces withdrew from the city.\nAccording to local authorities, 458 bodies have been recovered from the town, including nine children under the age of 18; among the victims, 419 people were killed with weapons and 39 appeared to have died of natural causes, possibly related to the occupation. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights documented the unlawful killings, including summary executions, of at least 73 civilians in Bucha. Photos showed corpses of civilians, lined up with their hands bound behind their backs, shot at close range. An inquiry by Radio Free Europe reported the use of a basement beneath a campground as a torture chamber. Many bodies were found mutilated and burnt, and girls as young as fourteen reported being raped by Russian soldiers. In intercepted conversations, Russian soldiers referred to these operations involving hunting down people in lists, filtration, torture, and execution as zachistka (\"cleansing\"). Ukraine has asked the International Criminal Court to investigate what happened in Bucha as part of its ongoing investigation of the invasion to determine whether a series of Russian war crimes or crimes against humanity were committed. The massacre was described by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as genocide.  \nRussian authorities have denied responsibility and instead claimed that Ukraine faked footage of the event or staged the killings itself as a false flag operation, and have claimed that the footage and photographs of dead bodies were a \"staged performance\". These assertions by Russian authorities have been debunked as false by various groups and media organizations. Additionally, eyewitness accounts from residents of Bucha said that the Russian Armed Forces carried out the killings.","content":"#Background\n#Reports\n##During the Russian offensive\n##After the Russian withdrawal\n##Testimony from residents\n##Video footage\n#Reported death count\n##In the city\n##Regionally\n##Notable victims\n#Russian units involved\n#Investigations\n##Ukraine\n##Russia\n##Amnesty International\n##The New York Times\n#Reactions\n##Ukraine\n##International organisations\n##Other countries\n#Russian response and denial\n##Censorship in Russia\n##Social media comments\n#See also\n#Notes and references\n##Notes\n##References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}
{"title":"Carl_Friedrich_Gauss","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss","summary":"Johann Carl Friedrich Gauss (German: Gauß [kaʁl ˈfʁiːdʁɪç ˈɡaʊs] ; Latin: Carolus Fridericus Gauss; 30 April 1777 – 23 February 1855) was a German mathematician, astronomer, geodesist, and physicist who contributed to many fields in mathematics and science. He was director of the Göttingen Observatory and professor of astronomy from 1807 until his death in 1855.\nWhile studying at the University of Göttingen, he propounded several mathematical theorems. Gauss completed his masterpieces Disquisitiones Arithmeticae and Theoria motus corporum coelestium as a private scholar. He gave the second and third complete proofs of the fundamental theorem of algebra, made contributions to number theory, and developed the theories of binary and ternary quadratic forms.\nGauss was instrumental in the identification of Ceres as a dwarf planet. His work on the motion of planetoids disturbed by large planets led to the introduction of the Gaussian gravitational constant and the method of least squares, which he had discovered before Adrien-Marie Legendre published it. Gauss was in charge of the extensive geodetic survey of the Kingdom of Hanover together with an arc measurement project from 1820 to 1844; he was one of the founders of geophysics and formulated the fundamental principles of magnetism. Fruits of his practical work were the inventions of the heliotrope in 1821, a magnetometer in 1833 and – alongside Wilhelm Eduard Weber – the first electromagnetic telegraph in 1833.\nGauss was the first to discover and study non-Euclidean geometry, coining the term as well. He further developed a fast Fourier transform some 160 years before John Tukey and James Cooley.\nGauss refused to publish incomplete work and left several works to be edited posthumously. He believed that the act of learning, not possession of knowledge, provided the greatest enjoyment. Gauss confessed to disliking teaching, but some of his students became influential mathematicians, such as Richard Dedekind and Bernhard Riemann.","content":"#Biography\n##Youth and education\n##Private scholar\n##Professor in Göttingen\n##Gauss's brain\n##Family\n##Personality\n###Scholar\n###Private man\n#Scientific work\n##Algebra and number theory\n###Fundamental theorem of algebra\n###Disquisitiones Arithmeticae\n###Further investigations\n##Analysis\n###Numeric analysis\n##Chronology\n##Astronomy\n##Theory of errors\n##Arc measurement and geodetic survey\n##Differential geometry\n##Non-Euclidean geometry\n##Early topology\n##Minor mathematical accomplishments\n##Magnetism and telegraphy\n###Geomagnetism\n###Electromagnetism\n##Potential theory\n##Optics\n##Mechanics\n##Metrology\n#Anecdotes\n#Honours and awards\n#Names and commemorations\n#Selected writings\n##Mathematics and astronomy\n##Physics\n###Together with Wilhelm Weber\n##Collected works\n##Correspondence\n#References\n##Notes\n##Citations\n##Sources\n#Further reading\n","lang":"en"}

It was her first major title. Rybakina became the first Kazakhstani to win a major title, and the third player representing an Asian nation to win a major title after Li Na and Naomi Osaka. She also became the first Kazakhstani to progress past the quarterfinals of a major. Rybakina became the first player to win from a set down in the final since Amélie Mauresmo in 2006. Jabeur became the first Arab to reach a major singles final, the first African woman to do so in the Open Era, and the first African woman to do so not representing South Africa. This marked the first time since 2009 that both finalists represented non-European nations.\nAshleigh Barty was the defending champion, but retired from professional tennis in March 2022.\nWorld No. 1 Iga Świątek's win streak of 37 matches (dating back to Qatar in February) ended when she was defeated by Alizé Cornet in the third round. It was just the fourth loss of Świątek's season; her 37-match winning streak is the longest of the 21st century and tied for 12th-longest in the Open Era.\nFor the second time in her career, Cornet defeated the incumbent world No. 1 in the third round at Wimbledon; she had defeated then-five-time champion Serena Williams at that stage in 2014. By making her 62nd consecutive major main draw appearance, Cornet tied Ai Sugiyama's all-time record. Williams received a wild card to play in the tournament, making her comeback to the sport after a year away due to a right hamstring injury sustained; this would be Williams' final appearance at the tournament.

Williams later announced her retirement from professional tennis at the US Open.\nThis was the first edition of Wimbledon to feature a champions tiebreak, a 10-point tiebreak when the score reaches six games all in the third set, and the third edition to feature a final-set tiebreak rule.

{"title":"Donald_Trump","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Donald_Trump","summary":"Donald John Trump (born June 14, 1946) is an American politician, media personality, and businessman who served as the 45th president of the United States from 2017 to 2021. \nTrump received a Bachelor of Science degree in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. His father made him president of the family real estate business in 1971. Trump renamed it the Trump Organization and reoriented the company toward building and renovating skyscrapers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. After a series of business failures in the late 1990s, he launched side ventures, mostly licensing the Trump name. From 2004 to 2015, he co-produced and hosted the reality television series The Apprentice. He and his businesses have been plaintiffs or defendants in more than 4,000 legal actions, including six business bankruptcies.\nTrump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote. The Mueller special counsel investigation determined that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to favor Trump. During the campaign, his political positions were described as populist, protectionist, and nationalist. His election and policies sparked numerous protests. He was the only U.S. president without prior military or government experience. Trump promoted conspiracy theories and made many false and misleading statements during his campaigns and presidency, to a degree unprecedented in American politics. Many of his comments and actions have been characterized as racially charged, racist, and misogynistic. \nAs president, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.–Mexico border, and implemented a family separation policy. He rolled back more than 100 environmental policies and regulations. He signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which cut taxes and eliminated the individual health insurance mandate penalty of the Affordable Care Act. He appointed Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett to the U.S. Supreme Court. He reacted slowly to the COVID-19 pandemic, ignored or contradicted many recommendations from health officials, used political pressure to interfere with testing efforts, and spread misinformation about unproven treatments. Trump initiated a trade war with China and withdrew the U.S. from the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, the Paris Agreement on climate change, and the Iran nuclear deal. He met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un three times but made no progress on denuclearization.\nTrump is the only U.S. president to have been impeached twice, in 2019 for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress after he pressured Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, and in 2021 for incitement of insurrection. The Senate acquitted him in both cases. Trump lost the 2020 presidential election to Biden but refused to concede. He falsely claimed widespread electoral fraud and attempted to overturn the results. On January 6, 2021, he urged his supporters to march to the U.S. Capitol, which many of them attacked. Scholars and historians rank Trump as one of the worst presidents in American history.\nSince leaving office, Trump has continued to dominate the Republican Party and is their nominee again in the 2024 presidential election. In May 2024, a jury in New York found Trump guilty on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to a hush money payment to Stormy Daniels in an attempt to influence the 2016 election, making him the first former U.S. president to be convicted of a crime.

An epic with aspects of a thriller, it follows the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the American theoretical physicist who helped develop the first nuclear weapons during World War II. Based on the 2005 biography American Prometheus by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, the film dramatizes Oppenheimer's studies, his direction of the Los Alamos Laboratory and his 1954 security hearing. Cillian Murphy stars as Oppenheimer, alongside Robert Downey Jr. as the United States Atomic Energy Commission member Lewis Strauss. The ensemble supporting cast includes Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, Josh Hartnett, Casey Affleck, Rami Malek, and Kenneth Branagh.\nOppenheimer was announced in September 2021. It is Nolan's first film not distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures since Memento (2000), due to his conflicts regarding the studio's simultaneous theatrical and HBO Max release schedule. Murphy was the first cast member to sign on the following month, with the rest joining between November 2021 and April 2022. Pre-production began by January 2022, and filming took place from February to May.

As with many of his previous films, Nolan used extensive practical effects, with minimal compositing.\nOppenheimer premiered at Le Grand Rex in Paris on July 11, 2023, and was theatrically released in the United States and the United Kingdom on July 21 by Universal Pictures. Its concurrent release with Warner Bros.'s Barbie was the catalyst of the \"Barbenheimer\" phenomenon, encouraging audiences to see both films as a double feature. Oppenheimer grossed over $977 million worldwide, becoming the third-highest-grossing film of 2023, the highest-grossing World War II-related film, the highest-grossing biographical film and the second-highest-grossing R-rated film at the time of its release.\nThe recipient of  many accolades, Oppenheimer won seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor (Murphy), and Best Supporting Actor (Downey).

Alex originated from a broad area of low pressure partially related to the remnants of Hurricane Agatha in the Eastern Pacific.

Wind shear and dry air kept the system disorganized until after it crossed Florida two days later. Finally, on June 5, the system became sufficiently organized and was named Alex while located north of Grand Bahama Island. Later that same day, Alex's winds briefly strengthened to 70 mph (110 km\/h). The storm brought rain and strong winds to Bermuda on June 6, before becoming a post-tropical cyclone that same day. Alex formed four days after the official start of the season, making the 2022 Atlantic hurricane season the first since 2014 not to have a pre-season named storm.\nThere were no reports of damage or casualties associated with Alex while it was a tropical storm. Its precursor disturbance, however, flooded streets and caused numerous power outages in Florida. And in Cuba it caused flooding and mudslides, which killed four people, damaged dozens of homes and knocked out electricity in various areas.","content":"#Meteorological history\n#Preparations and impact\n##Cuba\n##Florida\n##The Bahamas\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

After the fall of the Draghi government, which led to a parliamentary impasse, President Sergio Mattarella dissolved Parliament on 21 July, and called for new elections. Regional elections in Sicily were held on the same day. The results of the general election showed the centre-right coalition led by Giorgia Meloni's Brothers of Italy, a right-wing political party with neo-fascist roots, winning an absolute majority of seats in the Italian Parliament. Meloni was appointed Prime Minister of Italy on 22 October, becoming the first woman to hold the office.\nIn a record-low voter turnout, Meloni's party became the largest in Parliament with 26% of the vote; as per the pre-election agreement among the centre-right coalition parties, she became the prime ministerial candidate supported by the winning coalition. The League and Forza Italia suffered losses, polling 8% each, and Us Moderates polled below 1%. The centre-left coalition slightly improved its 2018 results in terms of vote share and seats in percentage with the Democratic Party polling 19% and the Greens and Left Alliance passing the 3% threshold; More Europe and Civic Commitment failed to reach the election threshold. The Five Star Movement defied single-digit polls before the campaign and reached 15%. The Action – Italia Viva alliance polled 7%. Among the others to be represented in Parliament were two regionalist parties: South calls North and the South Tyrolean People's Party. Due to the Rosatellum and its mixed electoral system using parallel voting, the centre-right coalition was able to win an absolute majority of seats, despite receiving 44% of the votes, by winning 83% of the single-member districts under the first-past-the-post of the system.\nAs a result of the 2020 Italian constitutional referendum, the size of Parliament was reduced to 400 members of the Chamber of Deputies and 200 members of the Senate of the Republic to be elected, down from 630 and 315, respectively. In addition, the minimum voting age for the Senate was the same as for the Chamber (18 years old and no longer 25), which marked the first time the two houses had identical electorates.\nObservers commented that the results shifted the geopolitics of the European Union, following right wing populist and far-right gains in France, Spain, and Sweden. It was also noted that the election outcome would mark Italy's first far-right-led government and the country's most right-wing government since 1945. The newly elected legislature was seated on 13 October, and proceeded to elect Ignazio La Russa, a known admirer of Benito Mussolini, and Lorenzo Fontana, a strong opponent of LGBT rights, as President of the Senate and of the Chamber of Deputies respectively. The Meloni Cabinet was sworn in on 22 October, and received parliamentary approval through two votes of confidence (one in each House of Parliament) a few days thereafter.","content":"#Background\n#Electoral campaign\n##Main parties' slogans\n##Electoral debates\n#Electoral system\n#Electoral lists\n##Lists with parliamentary representation\n##Lists without parliamentary representation\n##Lists running only in overseas constituencies\n#Opinion polls\n#Voter turnout\n#Results\n##Chamber of Deputies\n###Overall results\n###Proportional and FPTP results\n###Aosta Valley\n###Overseas constituencies\n##Senate of the Republic\n###Overall results\n###Proportional and FPTP results\n###Aosta Valley\n###Trentino-Alto Adige\n###Overseas constituencies\n##Leaders' races\n##Electorate demographics\n#Aftermath\n##Analysis\n##Reactions\n###Politics\n###News press and others\n#Government formation\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}
{"title":"Killing_of_Jordan_Neely","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Killing_of_Jordan_Neely","summary":"On May 1, 2023, Jordan Neely, a 30-year-old homeless black man, died after a 24-year-old white former Marine named Daniel Penny put him in a chokehold. Neely boarded a New York City Subway train at the Second Avenue station just before it departed and reportedly began screaming that he was hungry and needed a job, saying that he was not afraid of going to prison and was ready to die, and threatening people. Freelance journalist Juan Alberto Vázquez, who witnessed the incident, said that Neely removed his jacket and threw it violently to the floor, resulting in other passengers moving away from him. Vázquez said that he did not see Neely assault anyone. Other witnesses reported fearing death from Neely's actions, including him throwing trash at other passengers and approaching people. Penny then approached Neely from behind and put him in a chokehold.\nPenny maintained the hold after the train had reached its next stop, Broadway–Lafayette Street, while other passengers held the doors open to prevent it from moving. During the chokehold, some bystanders gave warnings on Neely's health, with one telling Penny, \"You're gonna kill him now\", while others helped in holding him down until police arrived. Vázquez captured the final three minutes of the hold on video, which shows Penny applying it for nearly a minute after Neely had stopped struggling and gone limp. Prosecutors alleged that the chokehold lasted for six minutes, while Penny said it lasted less than five minutes. An unknown amount of time after Penny released Neely, New York City Police (NYPD) officers arrived, with responding officers stating that Neely had a faint pulse upon their arrival. Neely was given Narcan and CPR by officers at the scene. Shortly thereafter, the New York City Fire Department transported Neely to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Penny was taken for questioning by the NYPD and released without charge several hours later. \nThe incident sparked public debate nationwide, as politicians and members of the public offered differing reactions to Penny's actions, including support and criticism. Critics of Penny joined protests and characterized him as a vigilante, demanded that Penny be charged, and alleged racism. Supporters of Penny defended him as good Samaritan seeking to protect other passengers and donated money to his legal defense. \nNeely's death was ruled a homicide by compression of the neck on May 4. On May 11, Penny was charged with second-degree manslaughter. Penny turned himself into the police the next day and was released on bond. On June 14, he was formally indicted by a grand jury. An additional charge of criminally negligent homicide was added on June 28. Penny pleaded not guilty to both charges. If convicted, Penny would face up to 20 years in prison. Two men shown in Vázquez's video helping Penny restrain Neely were not charged. Penny's trial began with jury selection on October 21, 2024.","content":"#Incident\n#People involved\n##Jordan Neely\n##Daniel Penny\n#Legal proceedings\n#Reactions and protests\n##Neely's family and friends\n##Public officials and community\n##Journalists\n##Protests\n#See also\n#Notes\n","lang":"en"}

It is the sequel to Minions (2015), a prequel to Despicable Me (2010), and the fifth entry overall in the Despicable Me franchise. The film was directed by Kyle Balda, co-directed by Brad Ableson and Jonathan del Val (in Ableson's feature directorial debut), and produced by Chris Meledandri, Janet Healy and Chris Renaud, from a screenplay written by Matthew Fogel, and a story by Fogel and Brian Lynch. It features Steve Carell reprising his role as Gru and Pierre Coffin as the Minions, along with Russell Brand, Will Arnett, Steve Coogan, and Julie Andrews reprising their respective roles as Dr. Nefario, Mr. Perkins, Silas Ramsbottom, and Gru's mother Marlena. New cast members include Taraji P. Henson, Michelle Yeoh, and Alan Arkin. In the film, an eleven-year-old Gru plans to become a supervillain with the help of his Minions, which leads to a showdown with a malevolent team, the Vicious 6.\nAfter being delayed for two years due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Minions: The Rise of Gru had its world premiere at the Annecy International Animation Film Festival on June 13, 2022, and was theatrically released in the United States on July 1. The film received generally positive reviews from critics; some deemed it an improvement over its predecessor, with praise earned for its score, animation, humor, voice performances (particularly Carell's), and aesthetic, although its plot was criticized. It was also a commercial success, grossing over $940 million worldwide and becoming the fifth-highest-grossing film of 2022.

{"title":"2022","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2022","summary":"2022 (MMXXII) was a common year starting on Saturday of the Gregorian calendar, the 2022nd year of the Common Era (CE) and Anno Domini (AD) designations, the 22nd  year of the 3rd millennium and the 21st century, and the  3rd   year of the 2020s decade.  \nThe year began with another wave in the COVID-19 pandemic, with Omicron spreading rapidly and becoming the dominant variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus worldwide. Tracking a decrease in cases and deaths, 2022 saw the removal of most COVID-19 restrictions and the reopening of international borders in the vast majority of countries, while the global rollout of COVID-19 vaccines continued. The global economic recovery from the pandemic continued, though many countries experienced an ongoing inflation surge; in response, many central banks raised their interest rates to landmark levels. The world population reached eight billion people in 2022. The year also witnessed numerous natural disasters, including two devastating Atlantic hurricanes (Fiona and Ian), and the most powerful volcano eruption of the century so far. The later part of the year also saw the first public release of ChatGPT by OpenAI starting an arms race in artificial intelligence which increased in intensity into 2023, as well as the collapse of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX.\n2022 was also dominated by wars and armed conflicts. While escalations into the internal conflict in Myanmar and the Tigray War dominated the heightening of tensions within their regions and each caused over 10,000 deaths, 2022 was most notable for the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the largest armed conflict in Europe since World War II. The invasion caused the displacement of 15.7 million Ukrainians (8 million internally displaced persons and 7.7 million refugees), and led to international condemnations and sanctions and nuclear threats, the withdrawal of hundreds of companies from Russia, and the exclusion of Russia from major sporting events.","content":"#Conflicts\n#Events\n##January\n##February\n##March\n##April\n##May\n##June\n##July\n##August\n##September\n##October\n##November\n##December\n#Demographics\n#Deaths\n#Nobel Prizes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Neoplatonism","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Neoplatonism","summary":"Neoplatonism is a version of Platonic philosophy that emerged in the 3rd century AD against the background of Hellenistic philosophy and religion. The term does not encapsulate a set of ideas as much as a series of thinkers. Among the common ideas it maintains is monism, the doctrine that all of reality can be derived from a single principle, \"the One\".\nNeoplatonism began with Ammonius Saccas and his student Plotinus (c. 204\/5–271 AD) and stretched to the sixth century. After Plotinus there were three distinct periods in the history of neoplatonism: the work of his student Porphyry (third to early fourth century); that of Iamblichus (third to fourth century); and the period in the fifth and sixth centuries, when the academies in Alexandria and Athens flourished.\nNeoplatonism had an enduring influence on the subsequent history of Western philosophy and religion. In the Middle Ages, Neoplatonic ideas were studied and discussed by Christian, Jewish, and Muslim thinkers. In the Islamic cultural sphere, Neoplatonic texts were available in Arabic and Persian translations, and notable philosophers such as al-Farabi, Solomon ibn Gabirol (Avicebron), Avicenna (Ibn Sina), and Maimonides incorporated Neoplatonic elements into their own thinking.\nChristian philosopher and theologian Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274) had direct access to the works of Proclus, Simplicius of Cilicia, and Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, and he knew about other Neoplatonists, such as Plotinus and Porphyry, through second-hand sources. The German mystic Meister Eckhart (c. 1260 – c. 1328) was also influenced by Neoplatonism, propagating a contemplative way of life which points to the Godhead beyond the nameable God. Neoplatonism also had a strong influence on the perennial philosophy of the Italian Renaissance thinkers Marsilio Ficino and Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, and continues through 19th-century Universalism and modern-day spirituality.","content":"#Origins of the term\n#Origins and history of classical Neoplatonism\n##Hellenism\n##Ammonius Saccas\n##Plotinus\n##Porphyry\n##Iamblichus\n##Academies\n##Hypatia\n##Proclus\n#Ideas\n##The One\n##Emanations\n###Demiurge or nous\n###World-soul\n###Phenomenal world\n##Celestial hierarchy\n##Evil\n##Return to the One\n#Influence\n##Early Christianity\n###Augustine\n###Origen and Pseudo-Dionysius\n###Gnosticism\n##Byzantine education\n##Islamic neoplatonism\n##Jewish thought\n##Medieval Christian Thought\n##Western Renaissance\n##Cambridge Platonists (17th century)\n##Modern neoplatonism\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

Production began at DreamWorks Animation's Glendale campus and some additional production assets were borrowed from Jellyfish Pictures, with voice acting being done remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe Bad Guys was released theatrically in several countries beginning on March 16, 2022, and in the United States on April 22, in 2D and RealD 3D formats.

{"title":"Opera_in_Ukraine","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Opera_in_Ukraine","summary":"A national school of opera in Ukraine first emerged during the last third of the 19th century, and was based on the traditions of European theatre and Ukrainian folk music. The first opera by a Ukrainian composer was Maxim Berezovsky's Demofont, based on an Italian libretto, which premiered in 1773. The oldest opera in the Ukrainian musical repertoire, A Zaporozhye Cossack on the Danube by Semen Hulak-Artemovsky, was written in 1863. The composer Mykola Lysenko, the founder of Ukrainian opera, composed a number of works, including Natalka Poltavka, Taras Bulba, Nocturne, and two operas for children, Koza-dereza and Mr Kotsky.\nUkrainian opera flourished and developed after the creation of the first professional opera houses in the 1920s, with Borys Lyatoshynsky's The Golden Ring (1929) being one of the most notable works produced there during the first half of the 20th century. From 1930 until the dissolution of the Soviet Union at the end of the 1980s, operatic performances and the creation of new works occurred under the dominance of Soviet socialist realism. During this period, Ukrainian opera was modelled on such works as The Young Guard by Yuliy Meitus, premiered in 1947. Ukrainian opera was able to develop once more during the Khrushchev Thaw from the mid-1950s to the mid-1960s. Works by Vitaly Kyreiko (Forest Song (1957)), Vitaliy Hubarenko (Love Letters (1971)), or Yevhen Stankovych's folk opera When the Fern Blooms (1979) adopted more modern themes and musical expressions that were used during the Stalinist period. Of works written during the 21st century, Moses by Myroslav Skoryk is alone in retaining its place in the local repertoire.\nUkraine has seven opera houses, which include the Taras Shevchenko National Academic Opera and Ballet Theatre of Ukraine in Kyiv, the Odesa Opera House, and the Lviv Opera House. In Ukraine, operas are staged in opera studios in the country's music conservatories and largest theatres.","content":"#Origins\n##Shkilʹna dramy (school dramas)\n##Vertepy (nativity scenes)\n##Vaudeville\n#Operetta\n#Obstacles to the development of Ukrainian-language opera\n#Emergence of Ukrainian opera\n##Mykola Lysenko\n##Lysenko's contemporaries and successors\n#Period of resurgence\n##1910s\n##1920s and early 1930s\n###Historical opera\n#Stalinism (1932–1956)\n##World War II\n##1945–1953\n#1953–1991\n##1953–1970\n##1970s\n##1980s\n#Post-independence operas\n#Opera houses\n#References\n##Notes\n##Citations\n##Sources\n#Further reading\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Twitter_Files","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Twitter_Files","summary":"The Twitter Files are a series of releases of select internal Twitter, Inc. documents published from December 2022 through March 2023 on Twitter. CEO Elon Musk gave the documents to journalists Matt Taibbi, Bari Weiss, Lee Fang, and authors Michael Shellenberger, David Zweig and Alex Berenson shortly after he acquired Twitter on October 27, 2022. Taibbi and Weiss coordinated the publication of the documents with Musk, releasing details of the files as a series of Twitter threads.\nAfter the first set of files was published, various technology and media journalists said that the reported evidence demonstrated little more than Twitter's policy team struggling with difficult decisions, but resolving such matters swiftly.  Some conservatives said that  the documents demonstrated what they called Twitter's liberal bias.\nA major aspect of the examination surrounded false assertions by Musk and others that Twitter had been ordered by the government to help presidential candidate Joe Biden in the coming election by suppressing an October 2020 New York Post story about Hunter Biden's laptop. Researcher Matt Taibbi found no evidence of government involvement in Twitter's decision to initially withhold the story.\nIn a June 2023 court filing, Twitter attorneys strongly denied that the Files showed the government had coerced the company to censor content, as Musk and many Republicans claimed. Former Twitter employees asserted that Republican officials also made takedown requests so often that Twitter had to keep a database tracking them.\nInternal Twitter emails showed the company allowed accounts operated by the U.S. military to run a Middle East influence campaign; some accounts were kept on the platform for years before being taken down.\nThe releases prompted debate over the nature of blacklisting, vows for congressional investigation, calls for the full release of all documents for the sake of transparency, and calls to improve content moderation processes at Twitter.","content":"#Background\n#Topics\n##No. 1: Content moderation of New York Post story\n##No. 2: Visibility filtering\n##Nos. 3–5: Attack on the Capitol and suspension of Donald Trump\n##Nos. 6–7: FBI communications with Twitter Trust and Safety Team\n##Nos. 8–9: Relationship with the U.S. government\n##No. 10: Moderation of COVID-19 content\n##No. 15: Hamilton 68 Dashboard\n##No. 16: Insults directed to and from Donald Trump and other Republicans\n##No. 17: Global Engagement Center\n##No. 19: The Virality Project\n#Reactions\n##Politicians\n##FBI\n##Legal scholars\n##Privacy and security\n##Former Twitter CEO\n##Journalists\n##Wikipedia article\n#Aftermath\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Storm_Daniel","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Storm_Daniel","summary":"Storm Daniel, also known as Cyclone Daniel, was the deadliest Mediterranean tropical-like cyclone in recorded history, as well as one of the costliest tropical cyclones on record outside of the North Atlantic Basin. Forming as a low-pressure system around 4 September 2023, the storm affected Greece, Bulgaria, and Turkey with extensive flooding. The storm then organized as a Mediterranean low and was designated as Storm Daniel. It soon acquired quasi-tropical characteristics and moved toward the coast of Libya, where it caused catastrophic flooding before degenerating into a remnant low. The storm was the result of an omega block; a high-pressure zone sandwiched between two zones of low pressure, with the isobars shaping like the Greek letter omega (Ω).\nIn Greece, severe rainfall led to flooding that caused more than two billion euros in damage, making it the most costly recorded storm for the country. Libya was hit the hardest, with torrential rains causing two dams near the city of Derna to fail. This resulted in over 5,900 deaths and 7,000 injuries, with at least 8,000 others missing. Libya's vulnerability to such disasters was blamed on its civil war, which damaged critical infrastructure and left it in poor condition before the storm. In the aftermath, several countries along the Mediterranean Sea pledged to provide aid to affected countries.","content":"#Meteorological history\n#Impact\n##Greece\n##Turkey\n##Bulgaria\n##Libya\n###Preparations\n###Derna dam failures\n###Other areas\n###Nationwide impact\n##Egypt\n##Israel\n#Aftermath\n##Libya\n###Domestic reactions\n###International reactions\n##Economic effects\n##Effects on migration\n#See also\n#References\n##Notes\n##Citations\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Top-four_primary","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Top-four_primary","summary":"A final-four or final-five primary is an electoral system using a nonpartisan primary by multi-winner plurality in the first step. \nUp to four or five candidates, those with the most votes from the primary, regardless of the political party, then undergo a first round of single non-transferable vote (SNTV) voting. The round two (general) election, held some weeks later, uses instant-runoff voting (IRV, also known as ranked-choice voting, RCV) to select a winner among these top candidates.\nThe system has been criticized for eliminating most if not all, of the theoretical advantages of RCV-IRV over the two-round system by reintroducing vote splitting into the primary procedure, restoring a second (costly) primary election, and delegating much of the decision-making to an unrepresentative, low-turnout primary election.\nThe Final-Four Voting system was first proposed by businessmen Katherine Gehl and Michael Porter in a 2017 report entitled \"Why Competition in the Politics Industry is Failing America\". It was first advocated by FairVote in 2012. FairVote proposed a statutory model in 2015.\nIt was first used in the 2022 Alaska special election. In the first round of the general election, Republican votes were split between first-rank preferences for Palin and Peltola, creating a spoiler effect known as a center squeeze. Begich was eliminated first (although he had received a higher number of votes in the blanket primary than either of the remaining two candidates.) In the final runoff, Begich voters transferred their choices to Palin and Peltola, and Peltola won. Despite Begich's greater overall popularity, Palin's second-choice votes were not allowed to transfer to Begich (which would have allowed Begich to win the election).\nA top-four primary can be seen as a variation of a two-round system, in which the second round (general election) is always held, even if a candidate gains a majority in the first (primary) round. A candidate receiving 20% of the primary vote is logically guaranteed to pass a top-four primary. One variation, called Final Five Voting, allows five candidates to pass the open primary.","content":"#Usage\n##Top-four\n###Alaska\n###Missouri\n##Top-five\n###Nevada\n#Benefits\n#Drawbacks\n##Vote splitting\n###Primary\n###General\n##Voter deception\n#Variations\n##Final Five Voting\n##Primary\n##Post-primary\n##General\n##Summary\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Turning_Red","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Turning_Red","summary":"Turning Red is a 2022 American animated coming-of-age fantasy comedy-drama film produced by Pixar Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures. It was directed by Domee Shi (in her feature directorial debut) and produced by Lindsey Collins, from a screenplay written by Shi and Julia Cho, and a story by Shi, Cho, and Sarah Streicher. The film marks the first Pixar feature film solely directed by a woman. It stars the voices of Rosalie Chiang, Sandra Oh, Ava Morse, Hyein Park, Maitreyi Ramakrishnan, Orion Lee, Wai Ching Ho, Tristan Allerick Chen, and James Hong. Set in Toronto, Ontario in 2002, the film follows Meilin \"Mei\" Lee (Chiang), a 13-year-old Chinese-Canadian student who transforms into a giant red panda when she experiences any strong emotion, due to a hereditary curse.\nShi, who previously directed the short film Bao (2018), developed the film based on her experiences growing up in Toronto. She pitched three concepts, including Turning Red, to Pixar in October 2017. Development began in May 2018 when Shi was announced as writer and director of a full-length film; several Pixar animators visited locations around Northern California gathering inspiration and visual references. The design and animation were inspired by anime works. To capture these anime influences, hand-drawn 2D animated effects were added atop Pixar's 3D animation. Development on Turning Red lasted for four years, on an approximate $175 million budget, becoming the fastest production for a Pixar film. Ludwig Göransson composed the film's musical score for his first animated film, with Billie Eilish and Finneas O'Connell writing original songs for the film.\nTurning Red was first shown in London at Everyman Borough Yards on February 21, 2022, as a special screening, in Toronto at TIFF Bell Lightbox on March 8, and at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles on March 1. Originally planned for a worldwide theatrical release, plans were changed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The film was released on March 11, 2022, on the Disney+ streaming service and was released theatrically in most countries without the streaming service, grossing over $21 million. It was paired with the short film Kitbull for its theatrical release in the United States and the United Kingdom on February 9, 2024. Turning Red received critical acclaim and was nominated for Best Animated Feature at the 95th Academy Awards, among numerous other accolades.","content":"#Plot\n#Voice cast\n#Production\n##Development\n##Casting\n##Design\n###Setting\n###Inspirations\n##Music\n#Marketing\n##Promotion\n##Tie-in media\n#Release\n##Theatrical and streaming\n##Home media\n##Censorship\n#Reception\n##Box office\n##Viewership\n##Critical response\n##Accolades\n#Future\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

During the House Committee's subsequent investigation, people gave sworn testimony that Trump knew he lost the election. The Committee subpoenaed his testimony, identifying him as \"the center of the first and only effort by any U.S. President to overturn an election and obstruct the peaceful transition of power\". He sued the committee and never testified.\nOn December 19, 2022, the Committee voted unanimously to refer Trump and the lawyer John Eastman to the U.S. Department of Justice for prosecution. The committee recommended charging Trump with obstruction of an official proceeding; conspiracy to defraud the United States; conspiracy to make a false statement; and attempts to \"incite\", \"assist\" or \"aid or comfort\" an insurrection. Obstruction and conspiracy to defraud were also the recommended charges for Eastman. The committee simultaneously released a summary of its findings, and it published the remainder of its 845-page final report three days later. That week, it also began publishing interview transcripts.\nThe Committee interviewed over a thousand people and reviewed over a million documents. Some members of Trump's inner circle cooperated, while others defied the committee. For refusing to testify:\n\nSteve Bannon and Peter Navarro were convicted of contempt of Congress. Each was sentenced to four months in prison.

{"title":"Chevalier_de_Saint-Georges","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Chevalier_de_Saint-Georges","summary":"Joseph Bologne, Chevalier de Saint-George(s) (25 December 1745 – 9 June 1799) was a French violinist, conductor, composer and soldier. Moreover he demonstrated excellence as a fencer, an athlete and an accomplished dancer.\nHis historical significance lies partly in his distinctive background as a biracial free man of color. Bologne was the first classical composer of African descent to attain widespread acclaim in European music. He composed an array of violin concertos, string quartets, sinfonia concertantes, violin duets, sonatas, two symphonies and an assortment of stage works, notably opéra comique.\nBorn in the French colony of Guadeloupe, his father, Georges Bologne de Saint-Georges, was a wealthy, white plantation owner, while his mother was one of the Creole people Georges kept enslaved. At the age of seven, he was taken to France where he began his formal education. As a young man he won a fencing contest leading to his appointment as a \"gendarme de la garde du roi\" by king Louis XVI. Having received music and musical composition lessons, he joined the orchestra Le Concert des Amateurs; culminating in his appointment as its conductor in 1773.\nIn 1776, Saint-Georges began conducting the Paris Opera. However, this prospect was thwarted by opposition from certain performers who resisted the idea of being led by an individual of color. Around this time, he shifted his focus to composing operas. In 1781, he joined a new orchestra Le Concert de la Loge Olympique. By 1785, he had stopped composing instrumental works altogether. Following the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789, Saint-Georges left for England.

{"title":"Dungeons_&_Dragons:_Honor_Among_Thieves","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dungeons_&_Dragons:_Honor_Among_Thieves","summary":"Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves is a 2023 American fantasy heist comedy film directed by Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley, who co-wrote the screenplay with Michael Gilio from a story by Chris McKay and Gilio. Based on the tabletop role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons, it is set in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting and has no connections to the previous film trilogy released between 2000 and 2012. Starring Chris Pine, Michelle Rodriguez, Regé-Jean Page, Justice Smith, Sophia Lillis, and Hugh Grant, the film follows bard Edgin Darvis (Pine) and barbarian Holga Kilgore (Rodriguez), who enlist a team of unlikely heroes to steal an ancient and powerful relic but come into conflict with evil forces.\nProduction went through various phases in development since 2013, beginning with Warner Bros. Pictures after beating Hasbro and Universal Pictures in a lawsuit over the film rights to the tabletop role-playing game, before moving to Paramount Pictures, each with various writers and directors. Goldstein and Daley were the final writers\/directors, using elements from the previous attempt by director Chris McKay and screenwriter Michael Gilio. Filming began in April 2021 in Iceland and later Northern Ireland.\nDungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves had its world premiere at South by Southwest on March 10, 2023, and was released in the United States on March 31, 2023, by Paramount Pictures. The film received positive reviews from critics, with praise for the performances of the cast, Goldstein and Daley's direction, visual effects, writing, score, humor, and tone, but underperformed at the box office, grossing over $208.2 million worldwide, possibly falling short of its break-even point.","content":"#Plot\n#Cast\n#Production\n##Development and casting\n##Writing\n##Filming and visual effects\n#Music\n#Release\n##Theatrical\n##Home media\n#Marketing\n##Promotion\n##Tie-in literature and merchandise\n#Reception\n##Box office\n##Critical response\n##Accolades\n#Future\n##Possible sequel\n##Spin-off television series\n#Notes\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"2022_French_legislative_election","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2022_French_legislative_election","summary":"Legislative elections were held in France on 12 and 19 June 2022 to elect the 577 members of the 16th National Assembly of the Fifth Republic. The elections took place following the 2022 French presidential election, which was held in April 2022. They have been described as the most indecisive legislative elections since the establishment of the five-year presidential term in 2000 and subsequent change of the electoral calendar in 2002. The governing Ensemble coalition remained the largest bloc in the National Assembly but substantially lost its ruling majority, resulting in the formation of France's first minority government since 1993; for the first time since 1997, the incumbent president of France did not have an absolute majority in Parliament. As no alliance won a majority, it resulted in a hung parliament for the first time since 1988.\nThe legislative elections were contested between four principal blocs: the centrist presidential majority Ensemble coalition, including Emmanuel Macron's Renaissance, the Democratic Movement, Horizons, as well as their allies; the left-wing New Ecological and Social People's Union (NUPES), encompassing La France Insoumise, the Socialist Party, Ecologist Pole and the French Communist Party; the centre-right Union of the Right and Centre (UDC), including The Republicans, the Union of Democrats and Independents, as well as their allies; and the far-right National Rally (RN). The NUPES alliance was formed in the two months following the presidential election, in which the left-wing vote had been fragmented; it consisted of the first French Left alliance since the Plural Left in 1997.\nIn the first round, there was some controversy among the Ministry of the Interior and news media about which bloc finished first, as both the NUPES and Ensemble obtained about 26% of the vote. They were followed by the RN on about 19% and UDC with about 11%. Turnout for the first round was a record-low 47.5%. In the second round, when turnout was higher than that of 2017, Macron's Ensemble coalition secured the most seats (245) but fell 44 seats short of an absolute majority. The NUPES was projected to win 131 (Ministry of the Interior) or 142 seats (Le Monde), while RN became the largest parliamentary opposition as a party (89). The UDC received enough seats (64 or 71) to be a kingmaker in the next government but suffered losses.\nThe results were perceived by political commentators as a dramatic blow for Macron, who, all at once, lost his majority in Parliament, three government ministers (Amélie de Montchalin for Ecological Transition, Brigitte Bourguignon for Health and Justine Bénin for the Sea) and three close parliamentary allies (incumbent president of the National Assembly Richard Ferrand, Macron's own former Interior minister and head of the LREM parliamentary group Christophe Castaner and MoDem parliamentary group leader Patrick Mignola), all defeated in their constituencies. The 2022 UEFA Champions League final chaos at the Stade de France on 28 May, rape accusations against newly appointed minister Damien Abad or the unusually long period between Macron's reelection as President and the formation of the new Borne government (26 days) have been cited as major factors in Macron's majority wipeout.\nMacron's government, which enjoyed a 115-seat majority before the election, now fell at least 38 short of an overall majority, the largest margin for any French Cabinet since 1958. This near-unprecedented situation created potential for political instability and gridlock. Prime Minister Élisabeth Borne offered her resignation on 21 June 2022, but Macron refused to accept it. Talks among the various parties to form a stable majority government began later on 21 June but rapidly failed. On 6 July, Prime Minister Borne presented her minority government policy plan to the Parliament.","content":"#Background\n#Electoral system\n#Dates\n#Major parties and alliances\n##Deputies not standing for reelection\n#Opinion polls\n#Results\n##First round\n##Second round\n##National results\n##Results by constituency\n##Electorate\n#Aftermath\n##Formation of parliamentary groups\n##Vote of no confidence\n#See also\n#Notes\n","lang":"en"}
{"title":"Halloween_Ends","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Halloween_Ends","summary":"Halloween Ends is a 2022 American slasher film directed by David Gordon Green, and co-written by Green, Danny McBride, Paul Brad Logan and Chris Bernier. It is the sequel to Halloween Kills (2021), the thirteenth installment in the Halloween franchise, and the final film in the trilogy of sequels that started with the 2018 film, which directly follows the 1978 film. The film stars Jamie Lee Curtis, Andi Matichak, Rohan Campbell, Will Patton, Kyle Richards, and James Jude Courtney. The plot follows the outcast Corey Cunningham who falls in love with Laurie Strode's granddaughter while a series of events, including crossing paths with Michael Myers, drives him to become a serial killer.\nBefore the release of Halloween in 2018, McBride confirmed that he and Green had intended to pitch two films that would be shot back-to-back, but decided against it, waiting to see the reaction to the first film. Following the success of the first film, in July 2019, the film's title was announced along with Halloween Kills. Green intended to give each film in the trilogy its own unique theme, Halloween Ends being a \"love story\"; John Carpenter described the film as a \"departure\" from its predecessors. After being delayed due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, principal photography took place in Georgia between January and March 2022, with re-shoots taking place in mid-2022.\nHalloween Ends premiered at Beyond Fest in Los Angeles on October 11, 2022, and was theatrically released in the United States on October 14, 2022, by Universal Pictures. The film started streaming simultaneously on paid tiers of Peacock. It received mixed reviews from critics, who criticized its focus on the new character Corey and generally deemed it a disappointing conclusion to the trilogy. The film grossed $105 million against a $33 million production budget, making it theatrically the lowest-grossing of the trilogy of films by Green and the third highest grossing film in the franchise.\nDespite the mixed reception, the film ranked #2 on The Hollywood Reporter's list of \"The Best Slasher Movies of the Decade\".","content":"#Plot\n#Cast\n#Production\n##Development\n##Writing\n##Casting\n##Filming\n##Post-production\n##Music\n#Release\n##Home media\n#Reception\n##Audience viewership\n##Box office\n##Critical response\n##Accolades\n#Future\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Banjska_attack","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Banjska_attack","summary":"The Banjska attack (Albanian: Sulmi në Banjskë; Serbian: Напад у Бањској, romanized: Napad u Banjskoj) was an armed assault carried out by Serb militants against the Kosovo Police which took place in the village of Banjska located in North Kosovo on 24 September 2023.\nBetween 23 and 24 September 2023, Serb militants initiated an attack on Kosovo police as they responded to a situation where trucks lacking license plates were blocking a bridge in Banjska. This incident resulted in the death of Kosovar sergeant Afrim Bunjaku, who was posthumously honored with the Hero of Kosovo order. Subsequently, the attackers sought refuge within Banjska Monastery, which was eventually retaken by the Kosovo Police. During this operation, three of the militants were killed, and a significant cache of weaponry was confiscated. A total of eight people were subsequently apprehended, four of whom were later released. Notably, Serb List Vice-president Milan Radoičić was implicated and later admitted responsibility for the attack, leading to his subsequent arrest.\nIn the aftermath of the attack, Kosovo, Albania and the European Union, along with several other nations, issued condemnations. Kosovo, the European Union and European Parliament classified the incident as a terrorist attack. Kosovo's Assembly denounced the incident and called for an international inquiry into alleged Serbian state involvement, urging appropriate measures by Western nations. Furthermore, the buildup of Serbian military forces along the Kosovo border prompted regional widespread concern, with calls for de-escalation and the bolstering of NATO deployments. Kosovo alleged Serbian state involvement, presenting evidence of training on Serbian territory. Concurrently, the Kosovo Intelligence Agency confirmed reports of a Serbian base construction near the border.","content":"#Background\n#Attack\n##Weaponry\n##Attackers\n##Casualties\n#Aftermath\n##Resolutions\n###Kosovo and Albania\n###European Union\n##Serbian state involvement\n##Serbian military buildup and base construction\n#Reactions\n##Kosovo\n##Serbia\n##International\n","lang":"en"}

His work often combines magic realism with historical fiction and primarily deals with connections, disruptions, and migrations between Eastern and Western civilizations, typically set on the Indian subcontinent. Rushdie's second novel, Midnight's Children (1981), won the Booker Prize in 1981 and was deemed to be \"the best novel of all winners\" on two occasions, marking the 25th and the 40th anniversary of the prize.\nAfter his fourth novel, The Satanic Verses (1988), Rushdie became the subject of several assassination attempts and death threats, including a fatwa calling for his death issued by Ruhollah Khomeini, the supreme leader of Iran. In total, 20 countries banned the book. Numerous killings and bombings have been carried out by extremists who cite the book as motivation, sparking a debate about censorship and religiously motivated violence. In 2022, Rushdie survived a stabbing at the Chautauqua Institution in Chautauqua, New York.\nIn 1983, Rushdie was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. He was appointed a Commandeur de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres of France in 1999. Rushdie was knighted in 2007 for his services to literature.

It commenced on March 17, 2023, in Glendale, Arizona, and is set to conclude on December 8, 2024, in Vancouver, consisting of 149 shows that span five continents. With a cultural and economic impact across the globe, the Eras Tour is the highest-grossing tour of all time and the first tour in history to surpass US$1 billion in revenue.\nSwift announced the Eras Tour in November 2022, following the release of her tenth studio album Midnights (2022), as her second all-stadium tour after the 2018 Reputation Stadium Tour. Running over 3.5 hours, the set list of the Eras Tour consists of over 40 songs grouped into 10 distinct acts that portray all of Swift's studio albums conceptually; the show was revamped in May 2024 to incorporate her then-new eleventh studio album, The Tortured Poets Department (2024). The tour also featured 19 opening acts—two per concert, such as Paramore, Phoebe Bridgers, Raye, Sabrina Carpenter, Benson Boone and Gracie Abrams.\nThe tour received praise from critics, who emphasized the concept, production, aesthetics and immersive ambience, as well as Swift's vocals, stage presence, and versatile showmanship. It recorded unprecedented public demand, ticket sales and attendances, bolstering economies, businesses, and tourism worldwide, dominating social media and news cycles, and garnering tributes and accolades from governments and organizations. On the other hand, the tour gave rise to multifarious issues: ticketing crashes that inspired a string of anti-scalping laws and price regulation policies; scrutiny of Ticketmaster for monopoly by US authorities; diplomatic tensions in Southeast Asia due to Singapore's exclusivity grant, poor venue management in Rio de Janeiro resulting in a death; a failed ISIS plot to attack the tour in Vienna; and a political scandal in the UK.\nSwift disclosed and released various works throughout the tour: the re-recorded albums Speak Now (Taylor's Version) and 1989 (Taylor's Version); editions of Midnights and The Tortured Poets Department; the music videos of \"Karma\", \"I Can See You\", and \"I Can Do It with a Broken Heart\"; and \"Cruel Summer\" as a single. An accompanying concert film, documenting the Los Angeles shows, was released to theaters worldwide on October 13, 2023, in an uncommon distribution deal circumventing major film studios.

He beat Pelosi with a hammer during a home invasion of the couple's Pacific Heights, San Francisco residence, leaving him with a fractured skull that required surgery.\nSan Francisco police arrested DePape, age 42, at the scene. He planned to take Speaker Pelosi hostage and interrogate her. Prosecutors believed the attack to be politically motivated. DePape had a history of mental health issues and drug abuse; before the attack, he had embraced various far-right conspiracy theories, including QAnon, Pizzagate, and Donald Trump's false claims of a stolen election in 2020. Online, he made conspiratorial, racist, sexist, and antisemitic posts, and pushed COVID-19 vaccine misinformation. His blog also contained delusional thoughts. At his subsequent trial, DePape testified that he was motivated by conspiracy theories and had hatched a \"grand plan\" to target Speaker Pelosi and others.\nOn October 31, DePape was charged with two federal crimes: assault of an immediate family member of a federal official with the intent to retaliate against the official on account of the performance of official duties; and attempted kidnapping of a federal official on account of the performance of official duties. He was also charged with six state felonies, including attempted murder, residential burglary, assault with a deadly weapon, and elder abuse. Within days, prominent right-wing figures, including former president Donald Trump, shared disinformation and misinformation about the attack, casting doubt on the assailant's motives and claiming that the attack was a false flag operation.\nDePape was convicted of the federal charges on November 16, 2023. On May 17, 2024, he was sentenced to 30 years in prison and five years of supervised release from the federal charges. DePape was also convicted of five state charges on June 21, 2024.","content":"#Break-in and attack\n#Investigation\n#Perpetrator\n##Life prior to the attack\n##Social media activity\n#State and federal prosecution\n##Federal trial\n##State trial\n#Reactions\n##Misinformation and disinformation\n#Notes\n#References\n#Further reading\n","lang":"en"}

It was released on 11 January 2023, through Dale Play Records – part of his popular Bzrp Music Sessions video series. Shakira's twelfth studio album, Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran (2024), is named after a lyric from the song and includes both the original version and a remix by Tiësto.\nA diss track taking aim at Shakira's ex-partner, footballer Gerard Piqué, as well as a women's empowerment anthem, the song reportedly \"broke the internet\", breaking various records for viewership and listenership for a Spanish-language and a Latin song, as well as having measurable market impact on certain brands mentioned in the lyrics. The song reached number one in 16 countries, as well as on the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart. It was Bizarrap's first and Shakira's fifth top-ten single (and first all-Spanish track) on the US Billboard Hot 100, her first since \"Beautiful Liar\" with Beyoncé (2007).

Nine people, including the perpetrator, were killed during the shooting, the youngest of whom was a three-year-old boy, and seven others were injured. The perpetrator was fatally shot by a police officer already in the area on an unrelated call.\nThe shooter, 33-year-old Mauricio Martinez Garcia, was a far-right extremist, although his specific motive for the spree killings was not clear. Martinez Garcia's extensive online writings showed that he self-radicalized, adopting and promoting white supremacist, neo-Nazi, and incel ideologies, and posting hateful comments against women, Jews and racial minorities in the lead-up to the attack. He committed the massacre while wearing a tactical vest embroidered with a \"RWDS\" (\"Right Wing Death Squad\") patch.

The elections coincided with elections for governor, U.S. Senate, attorney general, comptroller, state senate, and assembly, and various other state and local elections.\nFollowing the 2020 census, New York lost one seat in the U.S. House. Incumbent representatives Lee Zeldin (R), Thomas Suozzi (D), Kathleen Rice (D), John Katko (R), Chris Jacobs (R), and Joe Sempolinski (R) retired. Representatives Carolyn Maloney (D) and Mondaire Jones (D) lost renomination in their primary contests. The primary elections were set to happen on June 28, but due to a court-ordered redraw of the state's Congressional maps, they were held on August 23. Due in part to Kathy Hochul's relatively weak performance in the governor's race and heavy pro-Republican turnout, the Democratic Party lost four seats.\nWith 11 seats held this is the most seats won by Republicans since 2000 and the best performance in the popular vote since 2002.","content":"#2020-22 redistricting controversy\n#Overview\n##Votes by ballot line\n##Votes by district\n##Seat

{"title":"Death_of_Mahsa_Amini","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Death_of_Mahsa_Amini","summary":"On 16 September 2022, 22-year-old Iranian woman Mahsa Amini, also known as Jina Amini, died in a hospital in Tehran, Iran, under suspicious circumstances. The Guidance Patrol, the religious morality police of Iran's government, arrested Amini for allegedly not wearing the hijab in accordance with government standards. The Law Enforcement Command of the Islamic Republic of Iran stated that she had a heart attack at a police station, collapsed, and fell into a coma before being transferred to a hospital. However, eyewitnesses, including women who were detained with Amini, reported that she was severely beaten and that she died as a result of police brutality, which was denied by the Iranian authorities. The assertions of police brutality, in addition to leaked medical scans, led some observers to believe Amini had a cerebral hemorrhage or stroke due to head injuries received after her arrest.\nAmini's death resulted in a series of protests described by CNN as more widespread than the protests in 2009, 2017, and 2019, and by The New York Times as the largest Iranian protests since at least 2009. Some female demonstrators removed their hijab or publicly cut their hair as acts of protest. Iran Human Rights reported that by December 2022 at least 476 people had been killed by security forces attacking protests across the country. Amnesty International reported that Iranian security forces had, in some cases, fired into groups with live ammunition and had in other cases killed protesters by beating them with batons. Amini's death ignited the global Woman, Life, Freedom movement, rooted in her Kurdish background, which demands the end of compulsory hijab laws and other forms of discrimination and oppression against women in Iran.","content":"#Background\n##Victim\n#Circumstances of death\n##Aftermath\n#Protests\n##On the streets\n##On social media\n#Reactions\n##In Iran\n###Investigation\n##International institutions and organizations\n##2024 United Nations Human Rights Council report\n##Politicians\n##Celebrities\n##Others\n##In the arts\n#Sanctions\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Vladimir_Putin","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Vladimir_Putin","summary":"Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin (born 7 October 1952) is a Russian politician and former intelligence officer who is the president of Russia, serving since 2012 and previously from 2000 to 2008. Putin also served as prime minister from 1999 to 2000 and again from 2008 to 2012: He is the longest-serving Russian or Soviet leader since Joseph Stalin.\nPutin worked as a KGB foreign intelligence officer for 16 years, rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel before resigning in 1991 to begin a political career in Saint Petersburg. In 1996, he moved to Moscow to join the administration of President Boris Yeltsin. He briefly served as the director of the Federal Security Service (FSB) and then as secretary of the Security Council of Russia before being appointed prime minister in August 1999. Following Yeltsin's resignation, Putin became acting president and, in less than four months, was elected to his first term as president. He was reelected in 2004. Due to constitutional limitations of two consecutive presidential terms, Putin served as prime minister again from 2008 to 2012 under Dmitry Medvedev. He returned to the presidency in 2012, following an election marked by allegations of fraud and protests, and was reelected in 2018.\nDuring Putin's initial presidential tenure, the Russian economy grew on average by seven percent per year, driven by economic reforms and a fivefold increase in the price of oil and gas. Additionally, Putin led Russia in a conflict against Chechen separatists, reestablishing federal control over the region. While serving as prime minister under Medvedev, he oversaw a military conflict with Georgia and enacted military and police reforms. In his third presidential term, Russia annexed Crimea and supported a war in eastern Ukraine through several military incursions, resulting in international sanctions and a financial crisis in Russia. He also ordered a military intervention in Syria to support his ally Bashar al-Assad during the Syrian civil war, ultimately securing permanent naval bases in the Eastern Mediterranean.\nIn February 2022, during his fourth presidential term, Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which prompted international condemnation and led to expanded sanctions. In September 2022, he announced a partial mobilization and forcibly annexed four Ukrainian oblasts, together roughly the size of Portugal, into Russia. In March 2023, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Putin for war crimes related to his alleged criminal responsibility for illegal child abductions during the war. In April 2021, after a referendum, he signed into law constitutional amendments that included one allowing him to run for reelection twice more, potentially extending his presidency to 2036. In March 2024, he was reelected to another term.\nUnder Putin's rule, the Russian political system has been transformed into an authoritarian dictatorship with a personality cult. His rule has been marked by endemic corruption and widespread human rights violations, including the imprisonment and suppression of political opponents, intimidation and censorship of independent media in Russia, and a lack of free and fair elections. Russia has consistently received very low scores on Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index, The Economist Democracy Index, Freedom House's Freedom in the World index, and the Reporters Without Borders Press Freedom Index.","content":"#Early life\n#Education\n#KGB career\n#Political career\n##1990–1996: Saint Petersburg administration\n##1996–1999: Early Moscow career\n##1999: First premiership\n##1999–2000: Acting presidency\n##2000–2004: First presidential term\n##2004–2008: Second presidential term\n##2008–2012: Second premiership\n##2012–2018: Third presidential term\n###Annexation of Crimea\n###Intervention in Syria\n###Russia's interference in the 2016 US election\n##2018–2024: Fourth presidential term\n###COVID-19 pandemic\n###Constitutional referendum and amendments\n###Iran trade deal\n###2021–2022 Russo-Ukrainian crisis\n###Full-scale invasion of Ukraine (2022–present)\n###ICC arrest warrant\n###2023 Wagner rebellion\n##2024–present: Fifth presidential term\n#Domestic policies\n##Economic, industrial, and energy policies\n##Environmental policy\n##Religious policy\n##Military development\n##Human rights policy\n##The media\n##Promoting conservatism\n##International sporting events\n#Foreign policy\n##Asia\n##Post-Soviet states\n##United States, Western Europe, and NATO\n##United Kingdom\n###Poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko\n###Poisoning of Sergei Skripal\n##Latin America\n##Australia and the South Pacific\n##Middle East and Africa\n#Public image\n##Polls and rankings\n##Cult of personality\n##Public recognition in the West\n##Putinisms\n#Assessments\n##After the 2022 invasion of Ukraine\n#Electoral history\n#Personal life\n##Family\n##Wealth\n##Residences\n###Official government residences\n###Personal residences\n##Pets\n##Religion\n##Sports\n##Health\n#Awards and honours\n#Explanatory notes\n#References\n##Sources\n#Further reading\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

He was created Prince of Wales in 1958 and his investiture was held in 1969. He was educated at Cheam School and Gordonstoun, and later spent six months at the Timbertop campus of Geelong Grammar School in Victoria, Australia. After completing a history degree from the University of Cambridge, Charles served in the Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy from 1971 to 1976. In 1981, he married Lady Diana Spencer. They had two sons, William and Harry. Charles and Diana divorced in 1996, after they had each engaged in well-publicised extramarital affairs. Diana died as a result of injuries sustained in a car crash the following year. In 2005, Charles married his long-term partner, Camilla Parker Bowles.\nAs heir apparent, Charles undertook official duties and engagements on behalf of his mother. He founded the Prince's Trust in 1976, sponsored the Prince's Charities, and became patron or president of more than 800 other charities and organisations. He advocated for the conservation of historic buildings and the importance of architecture in society. In that vein, he generated the experimental new town of Poundbury. An environmentalist, Charles supported organic farming and action to prevent climate change during his time as the manager of the Duchy of Cornwall estates, earning him awards and recognition as well as criticism; he is also a prominent critic of the adoption of genetically modified food, while his support for alternative medicine has been criticised. He has authored or co-authored 17 books.\n\nCharles became king upon his mother's death in 2022. At the age of 73, he was the oldest person to accede to the British throne, after having been the longest-serving heir apparent and Prince of Wales in British history. Significant events in his reign have included his coronation in 2023 and his cancer diagnosis the following year, the latter of which temporarily suspended planned public engagements.","content":"#Early life, family, and education\n#Prince of Wales\n##Military training and career\n##Relationships and marriages\n###Bachelorhood\n###Lady Diana Spencer\n###Camilla Parker Bowles\n##Official duties\n#Reign\n#Health\n##Diet\n#Charity work\n##Investigations of donations\n#Personal interests\n##Built environment\n##Natural environment\n##Alternative medicine\n##Sports\n##Visual, performing, and literary arts\n##Religion and philosophy\n#Media image and public opinion\n##Reaction to press treatment\n#Residences and finance\n#Titles, styles, honours, and arms\n##Titles and styles\n##Arms\n##Banners, flags, and standards\n###As heir apparent\n###As sovereign\n#Issue\n#Ancestry\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n##Citations\n##Bibliography\n#Further reading\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}
{"title":"Saw_X","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Saw_X","summary":"Saw X is a 2023 American horror film directed and edited by Kevin Greutert and written by Peter Goldfinger and Josh Stolberg. The film is the tenth installment in the Saw film series, serving as a direct interquel set between Saw (2004) and Saw II (2005).  It stars Tobin Bell and Shawnee Smith, who reprise their roles from the previous films, alongside Synnøve Macody Lund, Steven Brand, Renata Vaca, and Michael Beach. The film sees John Kramer (Bell) travelling to Mexico in hopes that an experimental procedure may cure his terminal cancer. John later discovers that the operation is a scam, prompting him to kidnap those responsible and subject them to his trademark death traps as retribution, with Amanda Young (Smith) acting as his accomplice.\nA tenth installment was reported to be in development with Twisted Pictures in April 2021, when Stolberg and Goldfinger, writers for the previous two entries of the series, announced that they had completed the script in December 2021. Greutert, who had directed two other installments of the series and edited six, was also confirmed as the film's director.

The industry continued its trend of acquisitions and mergers, highlighted by Microsoft announcing its plan to acquire Activision Blizzard for nearly $69 billion. The industry as a whole continued to deal with issues such as workplace harassment and discrimination, alongside crunch periods, leading to at least the quality assurance staff at three separate studios to vote to unionize.\nProduction of the ninth generation consoles, the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X\/S, remained constrained for the first part of the year, but eased up later in the year. New hardware trends included the widespread availability of graphics cards with real-time ray tracing, and the release of the Steam Deck by Valve, a handheld personal computing device capable of playing most games available on Steam. The gaming community remained cautious on the metaverse and blockchain games, though leading publishers expressed their desires to move more into that space.","content":"#Top-rated games\n##Major awards\n##Critically acclaimed games\n#Financial performance\n#Major events\n##Ukrainian support\n#Notable deaths\n#Hardware releases\n#Game releases\n##January–March\n##April–June\n##July–September\n##October–December\n#Video game-based film and television releases\n#Cancelled games\n#See also\n#Notes\n","lang":"en"}

Usher, Chace Crawford, Laz Alonso, Tomer Capone, Karen Fukuhara, Nathan Mitchell, Elisabeth Shue, Colby Minifie, Aya Cash, Claudia Doumit, Jensen Ackles, Cameron Crovetti, Susan Heyward, Valorie Curry, and Jeffrey Dean Morgan.\nIntended to be a feature-length film trilogy, the comic book series adaptation began its development in 2008, with Adam McKay set to direct. Due to creative differences between the crew and the studios that picked it up, the project was left in development hell. Eventually, the development for The Boys was revived in 2016 by Cinemax, which announced that it would be reworked as a television series. Kripke was recruited to be the showrunner of the series, while Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg would be credited as executive producers.

It was played at the Stade de France in Saint-Denis, France, on 28 May 2022, between English club Liverpool and Spanish club Real Madrid. It was the third time the two sides have met in the European Cup final, after 1981 and 2018, the third final held at the Stade de France, after the 2000 and 2006 finals, and the first time the same two teams have met in three finals.

The final was originally scheduled to be played at the Allianz Arena in Munich. After the postponement and relocation of the 2020 final, the final hosts were shifted back a year, so the 2022 final was given to the Krestovsky Stadium in Saint Petersburg.

The offensive took place in the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh, which is de jure a part of Azerbaijan, and was a de facto independent republic. The stated goal of the offensive was the complete disarmament and unconditional surrender of Artsakh, as well as the withdrawal of all ethnic Armenian soldiers present in the region. The offensive occurred in the midst of an escalating crisis caused by Azerbaijan blockading Artsakh, which has resulted in significant scarcities of essential supplies such as food, medicine, and other goods in the affected region.\nOne day after the offensive started on 20 September, a ceasefire agreement described as a written agreement for the surrender of Artsakh was reached at the mediation of the Russian peacekeeping contingent where it was agreed that the Artsakh Defence Army, the armed forces of Artsakh would be disarmed. Ceasefire violations by Azerbaijan were nonetheless reported by both Artsakhi residents and officials until early October. On 28 September, the president of Artsakh, Samvel Shahramanyan signed a decree to dissolve all state institutions by 1 January 2024, bringing the existence of the breakaway state to an end.\nThe offensive and subsequent surrender resulted in a flight of Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians, in which nearly the entire population of Nagorno-Karabakh fled the region for neighboring countries, primarily Armenia. Human rights organizations and experts in genocide prevention issued multiple alerts that the region's Armenian population was at risk or actively being subjected to ethnic cleansing and genocide, as well as war crimes and crimes against humanity. Luis Moreno Ocampo, the inaugural prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, has classified the ethnic cleansing of Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians as a second Armenian genocide, and opined that the inaction of the international community encouraged Azerbaijan to act with impunity.","content":"#Background\n#Prelude\n#Offensive\n##19 September\n##20 September\n#Aftermath\n##Flight of Armenians from Nagorno-Karabakh\n##Arrests of Artsakhi officials\n##Negotiations and dissolution of Artsakh\n##Ceasefire violations\n##Humanitarian aid\n##Diplomatic efforts\n###Normalisation efforts\n#Risk of genocide\n##Reports of violence against Armenians\n##Azerbaijani concentration camp plans\n#International aspects\n##Reactions\n###Armenia\n####Armenian diaspora\n###Russia\n###Turkey\n###European Union\n###United Nations\n###Council of Europe\n###Other countries\n###Other international organizations\n##Foreign involvement\n###Israel\n###Turkey\n###Armenia\n#Analysis\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

Over 70 dissident candidates who refused the accord still ran.\nPer a press release, the union's founding goal for the 2022 French legislative election was to deny Emmanuel Macron's Ensemble Citoyens on the centre-right a presidential majority in the National Assembly, and to also defeat the French far-right. EELV and LFI signed an agreement that had the alliance won a majority of seats, they would have put forward Mélenchon as prime minister of France for a cohabitation. NUPES won the most seats outside of Ensemble, denying Macron a majority; at the same time, they underperformed expectations, only winning about 22% of the seats and 26% of the popular vote, while the far-right National Rally obtained its best result ever and became the largest parliamentary opposition group, due to NUPES being an electoral alliance.\nIn October 2023, the coalition's future was put in doubt when the Socialist Party voted a \"moratorium\" on its participation to the NUPES alliance following LFI leadership's refusal to qualify Hamas as a terrorist organization in the context of the Israel–Hamas war.","content":"#History\n##Formation\n##Expansion\n##2022 French legislative election\n##Electoral results and aftermath\n##Election of René Pilato\n##Quatennens Affair\n##Bayou Affair\n##Tensions with the Communist Party\n##Socialist infighting and election of Martine Froger\n##Socialist Party suspension\n#Members\n##Former members\n#Candidates 2022\n##Breakdown by constituency\n##Dissident candidates\n#Ideology and platform\n#Electoral history\n##Legislative elections\n#Reactions\n##PS majority and social-democratic left\n##PS minority and opposition\n##Extra-parliamentary left\n##Presidential majority\n#See also\n#Notes\n","lang":"en"}
{"title":"The_Holocaust","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Holocaust","summary":"The Holocaust was the genocide of European Jews during World War II. Between 1941 and 1945, Nazi Germany and its collaborators systematically murdered some six million Jews across German-occupied Europe, around two-thirds of Europe's Jewish population. The murders were carried out primarily through mass shootings and poison gas in extermination camps, chiefly Auschwitz-Birkenau, Treblinka, Belzec, Sobibor, and Chełmno in occupied Poland. Separate Nazi persecutions killed a similar or larger number of non-Jewish civilians and prisoners of war (POWs); the term Holocaust is sometimes used to refer to the persecution of these other groups.\nThe Nazis developed their ideology based on racism and pursuit of \"living space\", and seized power in early 1933. Meant to force all German Jews regardless of means to attempt to emigrate, the regime passed anti-Jewish laws, encouraged harassment, and orchestrated a nationwide pogrom in November 1938. After Germany invaded Poland in September 1939, occupation authorities began to establish ghettos to segregate Jews. Following the June 1941 invasion of the Soviet Union, 1.5 to 2 million Jews were shot by German forces and local collaborators.\nLater in 1941 or early 1942, the highest levels of the German government decided to murder all Jews in Europe. Victims were deported by rail to extermination camps where, if they survived the journey, most were killed with poison gas. Other Jews continued to be employed in forced labor camps where many died from starvation, abuse, exhaustion, or being used as test subjects in deadly medical experiments. Although many Jews tried to escape, surviving in hiding was difficult due to factors such as the lack of money to pay helpers and the risk of denunciation. The property, homes, and jobs belonging to murdered Jews were redistributed to the German occupiers and other non-Jews. Although the majority of Holocaust victims died in 1942, the killing continued at a lower rate until the end of the war in May 1945. \nMany Jewish survivors emigrated outside of Europe after the war. A few Holocaust perpetrators faced criminal trials. Billions of dollars in reparations have been paid, although falling short of the Jews' losses. The Holocaust has also been commemorated in museums, memorials, and culture. It has become central to Western historical consciousness as a symbol of the ultimate human evil.","content":"#Terminology and scope\n#Background\n#Rise of Nazi Germany\n##Persecution of Jews\n#Start of World War II\n##Ghettoization and resettlement\n#Invasion of the Soviet Union\n##Mass shootings of Jews\n#Systematic deportations across Europe\n##Extermination camps\n##Liquidation of the ghettos in Poland\n##Deportations from elsewhere\n#Perpetrators and beneficiaries\n#Forced labor\n#Escape and hiding\n#International reactions\n#Second half of the war\n##Continuing killings\n##Death marches and liberation\n#Death toll\n#Aftermath and legacy\n##Return home and emigration\n##Criminal trials\n##Reparations\n##Remembrance and historiography\n#Notes\n#References\n##Works cited\n###Books\n###Book chapters\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"December_2022_Twitter_suspensions","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/December_2022_Twitter_suspensions","summary":"On December 15, 2022, Twitter suspended the accounts of ten journalists who have covered the company and its owner, Elon Musk. They included reporters Keith Olbermann, Steven L. Herman, and Donie O'Sullivan, as well as journalists from The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN, and The Intercept. Musk cited an incident between \"a crazy stalker\" and a car with his child as a justification for the suspensions. Posters on behalf of the owners of the accounts said that the suspensions were permanent. On December 16, 2022, Musk stated that account access would only be restricted for seven days and on December 17, 2022, some accounts were reportedly restored with Musk citing Twitter community polls as the reason for the reversal.\nTwitter officials initially offered no explanation for their decision. They later stated it was due to violations of a new rule, created one day before the bans took place. The policy change prohibited accounts from sharing real-time flight information of private jets. The bans were allegedly in response to the @ElonJet account, which tracks Musk's private jet. The account and other similar accounts were suspended from Twitter on December 14, 2022, but continued operating on Facebook, Mastodon, and other social media platforms.\nSeveral of the suspended journalists said they had not violated the rule, and while some had included links to @ElonJet in their articles or reported about the account, it was already suspended at the time of media reports. The Twitter account of Mastodon – a rival social-media platform – was also suspended on December 15 after linking to @ElonJet on a Mastodon server. Users were unable to share Mastodon links in their tweets and they were labeled as \"potentially harmful\" and containing \"malware\".\nThe suspensions drew criticism from various organizations and individuals. Some said the actions undermined Musk's repeated claims of supporting free speech on Twitter, while others said Musk had a history of doxxing and harassing people in similar ways, which he was now criticizing. The suspensions were condemned by representatives of several countries and organizations, including the United Nations and the European Union. EU officials said the actions may have violated the Digital Services Act, which could result in sanctions or even a ban of Twitter in Europe. The Government Accountability Project filed a complaint to the United States Congress regarding the suspensions.","content":"#Background\n#Account suspensions\n##Twitter policy changes\n##Suspension of flight-tracking accounts\n##Suspension of journalist accounts\n##Explanation from Twitter and Musk\n#Reinstatement of some accounts\n#Responses\n##Suspended journalists\n##Other commentators\n#See also\n","lang":"en"}
{"title":"European_integration","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/European_integration","summary":"European integration is the process of industrial, economic, political, legal, social, and cultural integration of states wholly or partially in Europe, or nearby. European integration has primarily but not exclusively come about through the European Union and its policies.\nThe history of European integration is marked by the Roman Empire's consolidation of European and Mediterranean territories, which set a precedent for the notion of a unified Europe. This idea was echoed through  attempts at unity, such as the Holy Roman Empire, the Hanseatic League, and the Napoleonic Empire. The devastation of World War I reignited the concept of a unified Europe, leading to the establishment of international organizations aimed at political coordination across Europe. The interwar period saw politicians such as Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi and Aristide Briand advocating for European unity, albeit with differing visions.\nPost-World War II Europe saw a significant push towards integration, with Winston Churchill's call for a \"United States of Europe\" in 1946 being a notable example. This period saw the formation of theories around European integration, categorizing into proto-integration, explaining integration, analyzing governance, and constructing the EU, reflecting a shift from viewing European integration as a unique process, to incorporating broader international relations and comparative politics theories.\nCitizens' organizations have played a role in advocating further European integration, exemplified by the Union of European Federalists and the European Movement International.

The qualifying rounds took place from 3 to 12 April 2023 at the English Institute of Sport in Sheffield. The 15th and final ranking tournament of the 2022–23 snooker season, it was organised by the World Snooker Tour and sponsored for the first time by car retailer Cazoo. It was broadcast in the United Kingdom by the BBC, in Europe by Eurosport, and elsewhere in the world by Matchroom Sport and other broadcasters.

{"title":"Sudanese_civil_war_(2023–present)","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sudanese_civil_war_(2023–present)","summary":"A civil war between two major rival factions of the military government of Sudan, the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) under Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and its allies (collectively the Janjaweed coalition) under the Janjaweed leader Hemedti, began during Ramadan on 15 April 2023. Three minor (neutral) factions have participated in the fighting: Darfur Joint Protection Force, SLM (al-Nur) under Abdul Wahid al-Nur, and SPLM-N under Abdelaziz al-Hilu. Fighting has been concentrated around the capital city of Khartoum (largest and initial battle of the war) and the Darfur region. As of 8 September 2024, at least 20,000 people had been killed and 33,000 others were injured. As of 5 July 2024, over 7.7 million were internally displaced and more than 2.1 million others had fled the country as refugees, and many civilians in Darfur have been reported dead as part of the Masalit massacres.\nThe war began with attacks by the RSF on government sites as airstrikes, artillery, and gunfire were reported across Sudan. The cities of Khartoum and Omdurman were divided between the two warring factions, with al-Burhan relocating his government to Port Sudan as RSF forces captured most of Khartoum's government buildings. Attempts by international powers to negotiate a ceasefire culminated in the Treaty of Jeddah in May 2023, which failed to stop the fighting and was ultimately abandoned.\nOver the next few months a stalemate occurred, during which the two sides were joined by rebel groups who had previously fought against Sudan's government. By mid-November, the Minni Minnawi and Mustafa Tambour factions of the Sudan Liberation Movement officially joined the war in support of the SAF, alongside the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM). In contrast, the Tamazuj movement joined forces with the RSF, while the Abdelaziz al-Hilu faction of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement–North attacked SAF positions in the south of the country.\nStarting in October 2023, momentum began to swing toward the RSF, as the paramilitary defeated army forces in Darfur and made gains in Khartoum State, Kordofan, and Gezira State. Since February 2024, the SAF has made gains in Omdurman. Since June 2024, the RSF has made gains in Sennar State. Further negotiations between the warring sides have so far produced no significant results, while many countries have provided military or political support for either al-Burhan or Hemedti.\nAs of September 2024, the SAF has made notable gains in Khartoum North (alternatively referred to as Bahri).","content":"#Background\n##War in Darfur and the formation of the RSF\n##Political transition\n##Origins of the SPLM-N and the SLM\n##Prelude\n#Course of the war\n##April–May 2023\n###Battle of Khartoum\n###Treaty of Jeddah\n##June–September 2023\n###Continued fighting in Khartoum\n###Diplomatic efforts\n###SPLM-N (Al-Hilu) involvement\n###Darfur front\n##October–December 2023\n###SAF collapse in Darfur\n###Peace negotiations stall\n###RSF Crossing of the Nile\n##January–April 2024\n###Hemedti travels abroad\n###Fighting in Kordofan and Gezira\n###SAF gains in Omdurman\n##April 2024–present\n###Fighting in Darfur\n###Fighting in Kordofan\n###Fighting along the Nile\n###SAF offensives\n#Casualties\n##Darfur\n##Sexual violence\n##Casualties among humanitarian workers\n##Attacks on journalists\n##Foreign casualties\n##Notable deaths\n#Foreign involvement\n##Egypt\n###Egyptian POWs\n##United Arab Emirates\n##Russia\n###Wagner Group\n##Iran\n##Other foreign actors\n###Chad\n###Kenya\n###Libyan National Army\n###Ukraine\n###United Kingdom\n##Evacuation of foreign nationals\n##Sanctions\n###United States\n###Other countries\n#Humanitarian impact\n##Refugees\n#Economic impact\n#War crimes investigations\n#Disinformation\n##Examples\n##Responses\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"D._I._Suchianu","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/D._I._Suchianu","summary":"Dumitru Ion Suchianu, most often shortened to D. I. Suchianu or D.I.S. (2 September 1895 – 17\/18 April 1985), was a Romanian essayist, translator, economist and film theorist, also noted for his participation in politics. The son of a distinguished Armenian teacher-editor and his Romanian socialist wife, he was acquainted with, and inspired by, writer Ion Luca Caragiale, who visited his childhood home. Attending Iași's Boarding High School in the 1910s, he formed a lasting bond with Mihai Ralea. The two young men went on to study together at the University of Paris, where they earned their credentials as social scientists and political thinkers; Ralea also married Suchianu's sister Ioana. Their careers were tied to Viața Romînească magazine, put out by their mentor Garabet Ibrăileanu. It was here and in Adevărul newspaper that Suchianu made his reputation as a polemicist and essayist. His early writings tackled a variety of subjects, from political biographies and world affairs to legal history, a subject which also preoccupied him during his successive mandates at the Legislative Council. After 1927, he became directly involved in the ideological and aesthetic steering of Romanian cinema, as a columnist, film historian, censor, and eventually producer.\nThough publicly critical of Marxism, Suchianu established connections with the underground Romanian Communist Party during his stint at Cuvântul Liber newspaper. He continued to cultivate and defend communist intellectuals after taking over as co-editor of Viața Romînească in 1937, though he also struck controversy with his positive remarks on the fascist Iron Guard. In 1938, he and Ralea were co-opted by the dictatorial King Carol II, serving within his National Renaissance Front. Suchianu merged his positions at the Labor Ministry, held by Ralea, and the Ministry of Propaganda to establish a program of mass entertainment for the Romanian proletariat—the film component of a Muncă și Voe Bună leisure-package. He visited Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy to seek his inspiration, while explaining that he still did not favor the complete fascization of Romania. Suchianu was ultimately sacked in mid-1940 by Prime Minister Ion Gigurtu, with prosecutors sent in to investigate him as an alleged embezzler. This uncertain status was prolonged during the National Legionary State, established by the Iron Guard in 1940–1941, and then under the early years of the Ion Antonescu regime. He was never brought to trial, and Antonescu eventually allowed him to travel throughout Nazi-occupied Europe; this episode left Suchianu exposed to accusations of collaborationism.\nSuchianu said he had secretly supported the Soviet Union, and also to have directly participated in the August 1944 coup, which toppled Antonescu. He continued the leftward shift at Viața Romînească, with a new edition put out in 1944–1948, while also engaged in propaganda work for the National Populars, as well as for the Communist Party's own Bloc of Democratic Parties. He renounced his journalistic activities upon the imposition of a communist regime in 1948, and withdrew from literary activity altogether, until 1956; he was also imprisoned for a while, possibly as a means of ensuring Ralea's own political compliance. When he reemerged, it was almost exclusively as a translator and film critic, earning particular distinction, and the reading public's enduring affection, in the latter field. His essays mounted an academic defense of Hollywood crowd-pleasers against the cinematic avant-garde, and overlapped with affectionate memoirs of the silent film era.\nLate-communist reviewers celebrated Suchianu as a founding figure of Romanian film criticism, and, in some cases, identified him as a fellow student of Marxism-Leninism—though he was already a public critic of communist censors. His critical views of communism became known to the public from his 1980s interviews with Grid Modorcea, in the uncensored version published after the 1989 Revolution. An avid practitioner of various sports, and a certified ski instructor, Suchianu earned additional notoriety for his longevity and well-preserved agility, outliving Ralea by 20 years. He died at the age of 89, having continued to write until his last days.","content":"#Biography\n##Early life and debut\n##Interwar culture critic\n##Under fascism\n##1944 coup and communization\n##Old age and death\n#Legacy\n#Notes\n#References\n","lang":"en"}

His impeachment trial before the United States Senate delivered an acquittal on March 1, 1805, with none of the eight articles receiving the two-thirds majority needed for a conviction. \nThe impeachment was a partisan affair. It was an effort by the Thomas Jefferson-led Democratic–Republican Party to weaken a judiciary that had been largely shaped by the opposing Federalist Party.

One of the most prominent figures in hip hop, he is known for his varying musical style and polarizing cultural and political commentary. After dropping out of college to pursue a career in music, West began producing for regional artists in the Chicago area. As an in-house producer for Roc-A-Fella Records, he co-produced albums including Jay-Z's The Blueprint (2001) before signing with the label as a recording artist. West's debut studio album, The College Dropout (2004), was met with critical acclaim and yielded the Billboard Hot 100-number one single \"Slow Jamz\". He peaked the chart on four other occasions with the singles \"Gold Digger\" (2005), \"Stronger\" (2007), \"E.T.\" (2011, as a featured artist), and \"Carnival\" (2024).\nWest's second and third studio albums, Late Registration (2005) and Graduation (2007), both debuted atop the Billboard 200, the latter becoming West's most commercially successful to date. Three of his subsequent albums, 808s & Heartbreak (2008), My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (2010), and The Life of Pablo (2016), were certified triple platinum, and Yeezus (2013) was certified double platinum. While not as well-received critically as his previous efforts, Ye (2018), Jesus Is King (2019), and Donda (2021) continued West's series of consecutive number one debuts on the Billboard 200. West has also released the collaborative albums Watch the Throne (2011) with Jay-Z, Kids See Ghosts (2018) with Kid Cudi, and Vultures 1 and Vultures 2 (2024) with Ty Dolla Sign. In fashion design, he has collaborated with Nike, Inc., Louis Vuitton, and Gap Inc. on clothing and footwear, and led the Yeezy collaboration with Adidas.\nOne of the world's best-selling music artists with 160 million records sold, West has won 24 Grammy Awards, the joint 11th-most of all time and most awarded for any hip hop artist along with Jay-Z. His other accolades include a Billboard Artist Achievement Award, a joint-record three Brit Awards for Best International Male Solo Artist, and the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award. West holds the joint record (with Bob Dylan) for most albums (4) topping the annual Pazz & Jop critic poll. Time named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2005 and 2015. West's first six solo albums were included on Rolling Stone's  500 Greatest Albums of All Time list in 2020, with the same publication naming him one of the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time.\nWest's outspoken views have received significant media coverage. He has been a frequent source of controversy due to his conduct on social media, at award shows and public settings, as well as his comments on the music and fashion industries, U.S. politics, race, and slavery. His Christian faith, high-profile marriage to Kim Kardashian, and mental health have also been topics of media attention. In 2020, West launched an unsuccessful independent presidential campaign that advocated for a consistent life ethic. In October 2022, he was widely condemned and lost many sponsors and partnerships—including his collaborations with Adidas, Gap, and Balenciaga—after making a series of antisemitic statements, including denying the Holocaust.","content":"#Early life\n#Musical career\n##1996–2002: Early work and Roc-A-Fella\n##2003–2006: The College Dropout and Late Registration\n##2007–2009: Graduation, 808s & Heartbreak, and VMAs incident\n##2010–2012: My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, Watch the Throne, and Cruel Summer\n##2013–2015: Yeezus and the Yeezus Tour\n##2016–2017: The Life of Pablo and tour cancellation\n##2017–2019: Ye and the Wyoming Sessions\n##2019–2022: Jesus Is King, Donda, and Donda 2\n##2023–present: Vultures trilogy and Bully\n#Musical style\n#Other ventures\n##Fashion\n##Business ventures\n##Philanthropy\n##Acting and filmmaking\n##Presidential campaigns\n###2020\n###2024\n#Views\n#Personal life\n##Name change\n##Relationships and family\n###Kim Kardashian\n###Other relationships\n##Legal problems\n##Religious beliefs\n##Politics\n##Mental health\n#Musical impact\n#Awards and achievements\n#Discography\n#Videography\n#Tours\n#Books\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Legalism_(Chinese_philosophy)","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Legalism_(Chinese_philosophy)","summary":"Fajia (Chinese: 法家; pinyin: fǎjiā), or the School of fa (laws, methods), often translated as Legalism, is a school of mainly Warring States period classical Chinese philosophy, whose ideas contributed greatly to the formation of the bureaucratic Chinese empire, and Daoism as prominent in the early Han dynasty. The later Han takes Guan Zhong as a forefather of the Fajia. Its more Legalistic figures include ministers Li Kui and Shang Yang, and more Daoistic figures Shen Buhai and philosopher Shen Dao, with the late Han Feizi drawing on both. It is often characterized in the West along realist lines. The Qin to Tang were more characterized by its traditions.\nThough the origins of the Chinese administrative system cannot be traced to any one person, grand chancellor Shen Buhai may have had more influence than any other for the construction of the merit system, and could be considered its founder. His philosophical successor Han Fei, regarded as their finest writer, wrote the most acclaimed of their texts, the Han Feizi. Although briefly discussed by Xun Kuang, it otherwise contains the earliest commentaries on the Daodejing. Sun Tzu's Art of War recommends Han Fei's concepts of power, technique, inaction, and impartiality, with punishment and reward.\nConcerned largely with administrative and sociopolitical innovation, Shang Yang's reforms transformed the peripheral Qin state into a militarily powerful and strongly centralized kingdom, mobilizing the Qin to ultimate conquest of the other states of China in 221 BCE. With an administrative influence for the Qin dynasty, he had a formative influence for Chinese law. Succeeding emperors and reformers often followed the templates set by Han Fei, Shen Buhai and Shang Yang.","content":"#Retrospective current\n##Chapter 43 Ding fa\n##Imperial Confucian category\n#Military mobilization\n#Sima Qian\n#Huang-Lao and Mawangdui\n##Huang-Lao and Laozi\n##Shen Dao and Zhuangzi\n#Changing with the times\n##A.C.

{"title":"Barbenheimer","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Barbenheimer","summary":"Barbenheimer ( BAR-bən-hy-mər) was a cultural phenomenon which preceded and surrounded the simultaneous theatrical release of two films, Warner Bros. Pictures's Barbie and Universal Pictures's Oppenheimer, on July 21, 2023. The stark contrast between Barbie—a fantasy comedy by Greta Gerwig about the fashion doll Barbie—and Oppenheimer—an epic biographical thriller by Christopher Nolan about theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, a scientific director in the Manhattan Project—prompted a comedic response from Internet users, including memes, merchandise and memorabilia. Polygon described the two films as \"extreme opposites\", and Variety called the phenomenon \"the movie event of the year\".\nThe simultaneous release was an instance of counterprogramming. As the release date approached, instead of generating a rivalry, discussion centered on the appositeness of watching the films as a double feature, as well as in what order to watch them. Cast members of both responded by encouraging audiences to watch the films on the same day. Celebrity participants included actor Tom Cruise, who purchased tickets to watch both while his latest film, Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, was still playing in theaters. While the phenomenon began as a joke about the two films' seemingly endless differences, some media commentators have pointed out similarities; both films have been analyzed as exploring existentialism and the theoretical notion of the Anthropocene, each has an Academy Award-nominated director and screenwriter and a large ensemble cast, and both were produced by a husband-and-wife production company.\nBoth Barbie and Oppenheimer received critical acclaim and exceeded box-office expectations. Their joint opening weekend was the fourth-largest at the American box office, and both rank among the highest-grossing films of 2023. The phenomenon also extended to the year's awards season, in which both films emerged as leading contenders. The films earned a combined 21 nominations at the 96th Academy Awards. Both films were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture, which Oppenheimer won.","content":"#History\n##Release date dispute\n###Public reaction\n##Marketing\n##Double feature viewing\n#Reception\n##Box office\n###Projections\n###Gross\n##Film industry reaction\n##Japanese response\n##Analysis\n##Reviews\n##Accolades\n#Counterprogramming\n##Potential \"Glicked\" phenomenon\n#Notes\n#See also\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Cultural_impact_of_Taylor_Swift","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cultural_impact_of_Taylor_Swift","summary":"The American musician Taylor Swift has influenced popular culture with her music, artistry, performances, image, politics, fashion, ideas and actions, collectively referred to as the Taylor Swift effect by publications. Debuting as a 16-year-old independent singer-songwriter in 2006, Swift steadily amassed fame, success, and public curiosity in her career, becoming a monocultural figure.\nOne of the most prominent celebrities of the 21st century, Swift is recognized for her versatile musicality, songwriting prowess, and business acuity that have inspired artists and entrepreneurs worldwide. She began in country music, ventured into pop, and explored alternative rock, indie folk and electronic styles, blurring music genre boundaries. Critics describe her as a cultural quintessence with a rare combination of chart success, critical acclaim, and intense fan support, resulting in her wide impact on and beyond the music industry. \nFrom the end of the album era to the rise of the Internet, Swift drove the evolution of music distribution, perception, and consumption across the 2000s, 2010s, and 2020s, and has used social media to spotlight issues within the industry and society at large. Wielding a strong economic and political leverage, she prompted reforms to recording, streaming, and distribution structures for greater artists' rights, increased awareness of creative ownership in terms of masters and intellectual property, and has led the vinyl revival. Her consistent commercial success is considered unprecedented by journalists, with simultaneous achievements in album sales, digital sales, streaming, airplay, vinyl sales, record charts, and touring. Bloomberg Businessweek stated Swift is \"The Music Industry\", one of her many honorific sobriquets. Billboard described Swift as \"an advocate, a style icon, a marketing wiz, a prolific songwriter, a pusher of visual boundaries and a record-breaking road warrior\". Her Eras Tour (2023–2024) demonstrated what is considered to be her cultural apotheosis.\nSwift is a subject of academic research, media studies, and cultural analysis, generally focused on concepts of poptimism, feminism, capitalism, internet culture, celebrity culture, consumerism, Americanism, post-postmodernism, and other sociomusicological phenomena.

{"title":"Saint_Lucia","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Saint_Lucia","summary":"Saint Lucia is an island country of the West Indies in the eastern Caribbean. The island was previously called Iouanalao and later Hewanorra; these were names given by the native Arawaks and Caribs (respectively), two Amerindian peoples. Part of the Windward Islands of the Lesser Antilles, it is located north\/northeast of the island of Saint Vincent, northwest of Barbados and south of Martinique. It covers a land area of 617 km2 (238 square miles) with an estimated population of over 180,000 people as of 2018.  The nation's capital and largest city is Castries.\nThe first proven inhabitants of the island, the Arawaks, are believed to have first settled in 200–400 AD. Around 800 AD, the island would be taken over by the Kalinago. The French were the first Europeans to settle on the island, and they signed a treaty with the native Caribs in 1660. England took control of the island in 1663. In ensuing years, England and France fought 14 times for control of the island; consequently control over this immensely valuable geopolitical position changed frequently. Eventually, the British took complete control in 1814, shortly after the victory over French Emperor Napoleon. Because the island switched so often between British and French control, Saint Lucia was also known as the \"Helen of the West\" after the Greek mythological character, Helen of Troy.\nRepresentative government was introduced in 1924 with universal suffrage being established in 1951. From 1958 to 1962, the island was a member of the West Indies Federation. On 22 February 1979, Saint Lucia became an independent state, while remaining as a Commonwealth realm.\nSaint Lucia is a member of the United Nations, the Organization of American States, the World Trade Organization, CARICOM and the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS). It is also a member of Organisation internationale de la Francophonie.","content":"#Etymology\n#History\n##Pre-colonial period\n##Early European period\n##18th and 19th centuries\n##20th century\n##Post-independence era\n#Geography\n##Climate\n##Geology\n#Government\n##Administrative divisions\n##Law and crime\n##Foreign relations\n#Economy\n##Tourism\n##Agriculture\n##Infrastructure\n#Demographics\n##Ethnic groups\n##Languages\n##Religion\n##Education\n##Healthcare\n#Culture\n##Media\n##Music\n##Food\n##Sports\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n##Sources\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

Columbia Records released it as the album's lead single on January 12, 2023, in some countries and on January 13 worldwide. Cyrus wrote \"Flowers\" with Gregory Aldae Hein and Michael Pollack, while Kid Harpoon and Tyler Johnson handled the production. A pop song with disco, rock, and funk influences, its lyrics express an ex-lover's acceptance of being independent after no longer feeling the need to rely on someone else to be complete.\n\"Flowers\" received positive reviews from music critics and was a massive commercial success, breaking many records. It was the best-selling global single of 2023, earning 2.7 billion subscription streams equivalents globally, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), making it Cyrus's most successful single worldwide to date. In the United States, the single debuted at number one and spent eight non-consecutive weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100 in addition to becoming Cyrus's second number-one song on the chart, after \"Wrecking Ball\" (2013). \"Flowers\" spent 57 weeks at the top of Billboard Adult Contemporary chart, becoming the longest-running number one-song on any Billboard airplay chart, and earned the most cumulative weeks atop all Billboard airplay charts of all time. The song was also a commercial success worldwide, debuting atop the Billboard Global 200 chart and staying at the summit for thirteen non-consecutive weeks. It topped 60 different charts across 41 different countries, including in Australia, Canada, Ireland, Singapore, South Africa and the United Kingdom. It also broke a string of records on streaming services, including the Spotify record for the most-streamed song in a week (during both its first and second week), the fastest song in Spotify history to surpass one billion streams (doing so in 112 days), and the fastest female song to surpass two billion streams on Spotify (doing so in 502 days).\nJacob Bixenman directed the music video for \"Flowers\", which features Cyrus performing dances in several locations, including an outdoor pool, a backyard, and on the roof of her house.

Elizabeth's reign of 70 years and 214 days was the longest of any British monarch. She was succeeded by her eldest son, Charles III.\nElizabeth's death set in motion the most recent version of Operation London Bridge, a funeral plan first devised in the 1960s, and Operation Unicorn, the plan for the Queen's death in Scotland. Elizabeth's coffin lay at rest in St Giles' Cathedral in Edinburgh from 12 to 13 September, after which it was flown to London, where it lay in state in Westminster Hall from 14 to 19 September. An estimated 33,000 people filed past the Queen's coffin in Edinburgh, and approximately 250,000 people queued to pay their respects in London. The United Kingdom observed a national mourning period of ten days.\nElizabeth's state funeral on 19 September was the first held in Britain since Winston Churchill's in 1965. A funeral service was held at Westminster Abbey, followed by a procession to Wellington Arch which featured around 3,000 military personnel and was watched by approximately one million people in central London. The state hearse then transported the Queen's coffin to Windsor, followed by another procession through Windsor Great Park and a committal service at St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle. The Queen was interred later that evening with her husband, Prince Philip, in the King George VI Memorial Chapel, in a private service attended only by her closest family.\nDesignated as a public holiday in the UK and several Commonwealth states, the state funeral included dignitaries from around the world and featured the largest security operation ever mounted in the UK. Coverage of the state funeral was one of the UK's most watched special television broadcasts, surpassing the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, the previous most-watched royal event of the 21st century. The period of official mourning and the funeral was estimated to have cost the government £162 million.","content":"#Background\n#Death and national mourning\n##Death and announcement\n##Scottish events\n##Lying-in-state\n###Queue\n#State funeral\n##Planning\n##Procession to Westminster Abbey\n##Funeral service\n##Processions in London and Windsor\n##Committal service\n##Interment\n#Organisation and media\n##Attendees\n##Security\n##Cost and economic impact\n##Coverage\n###United Kingdom\n###Other countries\n###Viewing figures\n#Succession and four-nation tour\n##Accession\n##Four-nation royal tour\n##Other activities\n#Reactions\n#Other commemorations\n##Antigua and Barbuda\n##Australia\n##The Bahamas\n##Bhutan\n##Canada\n##Fiji\n##France\n##Hong Kong\n##Jamaica\n##Kenya\n##Malta\n##New Zealand\n###Cook Islands\n###Niue\n##Papua New Guinea\n##Saint Lucia\n##Solomon Islands\n##Sweden\n##United Kingdom\n##United States\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

Located in eastern Fairfield County at the mouth of the Pequonnock River on Long Island Sound, it is a port city 60 miles (97 km) from Manhattan and 40 miles (64 km) from The Bronx. It borders the towns of Trumbull to the north, Fairfield to the west, and Stratford to the east. Bridgeport and other towns in Fairfield County make up the Greater Bridgeport Planning Region, as well as the Bridgeport–Stamford–Norwalk–Danbury metropolitan statistical area, the second largest metropolitan area in Connecticut. The Bridgeport–Stamford–Norwalk–Danbury metropolis forms part of the New York metropolitan area.\nInhabited by the Paugussett Native American tribe until English settlement in the 1600s, Bridgeport was incorporated in 1821 as a town, and as a city in 1836. Showman P. T. Barnum was a resident of the city and served as the town's mayor (1871). Barnum built four houses in Bridgeport and housed his circus in town during winter.  The city in the early 20th century saw an economic and population boom, becoming by all measures Connecticut's chief manufacturing city by 1905. Bridgeport was the site of the world's first mutual telephone exchange (1877), the first dental hygiene school (1949), and the first bank telephone bill service in the US (1981). Inventor Harvey Hubbell II invented the electric plug outlet in Bridgeport in 1912. The Frisbie Pie Company was founded and operated in Bridgeport. The world's first Subway restaurant opened in the city's North End in 1965. After World War II, industrial restructuring and suburbanization caused the loss of many large companies and affluent residents, leaving Bridgeport struggling with issues of poverty and violent crime.\nSince the beginning of the 21st century, Bridgeport has begun extensive redevelopment of its downtown and other neighborhoods. Bridgeport's crime rate started going down significantly around 2010; by 2018, it had been reduced by almost 50 percent. Bridgeport is home to three museums, the University of Bridgeport, Housatonic Community College, Paier College, and part of Sacred Heart University as well as the state's only zoo. Bridgeport is officially nicknamed \"Park City\", due to its 35 public parks taking up 1,300 acres, including two large ones. Although none are headquartered within the city itself, more than a dozen Fortune 500 companies are based in its metropolitan area, which it shares with Stamford. Bridgeport by various sites has been consistently ranked as among the 25 most ethnically and culturally diverse American cities.","content":"#History\n##Colonial history\n##19th century\n##20th century\n##21st century\n##Notable speeches\n##Timeline of notable first and inventions\n#Geography\n##Neighborhoods\n##Climate\n#Demographics\n##2020 census\n##2010 census\n#Economy\n##Top employers\n#Arts and culture\n##Performing arts\n###Theater and music\n###Music festivals and concert series\n##Museums and zoos\n##Historic districts\n##Cuisine\n#Sports\n#Parks and recreation\n#Architecture\n#Government\n##Taxes\n#Education\n##Higher education\n##Public education\n##Charter schools\n##Private education\n#Media\n##Radio\n##Newspapers\n##Television\n##Movies filmed in Bridgeport\n##Television shows filmed in Bridgeport\n#Infrastructure\n##Transportation\n###Airports\n###Roads\n###Railroad and ferries\n###Buses\n##Emergency services\n###Fire department\n###Police department\n###Emergency medical services\n#In popular culture\n#Notable people\n#See also\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

Only one storm on record, Tropical Storm Bret in 1993, has tracked further south over South America.\nOn October 9, it became a hurricane and proceeded to make landfall in Nicaragua. It emerged into the Pacific Ocean as a tropical storm late that same day, becoming the eighteenth tropical storm of the 2022 Pacific hurricane season, and the second storm of the season to survive the crossover between the Atlantic–Pacific basin, after Bonnie in July. The storm then briefly moved along the coast of El Salvador, before moving inland and degenerating into an open trough over Guatemala on October 10.\nJulia brought heavy rains to much of Central America, causing life-threatening flash floods and deadly mudslides, exacerbating an already devastating rainy season. Floods, storm surge and the total or partial collapse of houses forced the evacuation of thousands of people. Its precursor disturbance triggered similar impacts in northern Venezuela. Altogether, Julia was responsible for 35 direct deaths, 54 indirect deaths, and at least US $406 million in damage.","content":"#Meteorological history\n#Preparations and impact\n##South America\n###Venezuela\n###Colombia\n##Central America\n###Nicaragua\n###Honduras\n###El Salvador\n###Guatemala\n###Costa Rica\n###Panama\n##Elsewhere\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

The family's prominence led locals to call the five-county district \"Murdaugh Country\". In addition to the legal positions, Randolph Murdaugh Sr. established the Murdaugh family law firm, now called the Parker Law Group, which specializes in personal injury litigation.\nA fourth-generation son, affluent lawyer Richard Alexander \"Alex\" Murdaugh, secretly led a life of crime that included acts of fraud, corruption, embezzlement, theft and drug offenses spanning decades and involving dozens of victims, many of whom were disadvantaged. The crimes culminated in 2021 when Alex murdered his wife Maggie and son Paul using multiple guns at close range. Murdaugh's trial ended with his conviction and sentencing to two consecutive life sentences in prison without the possibility of parole. The case captured national attention for many years and generated extensive media coverage, films and books.","content":"#14th District\n#Family law firm\n#Murdaugh hunting estate\n#Notable members\n##Randolph Murdaugh Sr.\n##Randolph \"Buster\" Murdaugh Jr.\n##Randolph Murdaugh III\n##Alex Murdaugh\n##Maggie Murdaugh\n##Buster Murdaugh\n##Paul Murdaugh\n#Alex Murdaugh murders and other legal issues\n##Ongoing investigations and legal actions\n###Murder of Stephen Smith\n###Death of Gloria Satterfield\n###Death of Mallory Beach\n###Assisted suicide fraud\n###Embezzlement\n###Charges for narcotics distribution\n###Lindsey Edwards allegations\n###Forge Consulting lawsuit\n###Santis-Cristiani lawsuit\n###Criminal tax evasion\n##Convictions, civil judgments, settlements, and sanctions\n###Asset custody\n###Physical custody\n###Disbarment\n###Murders of Maggie and Paul\n###Fraud and money laundering charges\n####State indictments\n####Federal indictment 22 counts\n#Media portrayals\n#Family tree\n#See also\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

In April 2018, the International Cricket Council (ICC) granted full international status to Twenty20 men's matches played between member sides from 1 January 2019 onwards. Therefore, all the matches in the Global Qualifiers were Twenty20 Internationals (T20Is).\nGlobal Qualifier A was contested by eight teams that advanced from their Regional Finals, were eliminated in the first round of the 2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup, or were one of the highest ranked sides not already qualified to this stage. The eight teams were placed in two groups, with two sides from each group advancing to the semi-finals. The two teams that reached the final of the Global Qualifier advanced to the 2022 ICC Men's T20 World Cup in Australia.\nImmediately prior to the Global Qualifier, Ireland, Nepal, Oman and the United Arab Emirates played in a quadrangular series at the same venue. Canada and Germany played two warm-up matches against each other, while Bahrain planned friendlies against Nepal and Philippines. In another practice fixture, Canada beat Bahrain by 38 runs. The Philippines, making their debut in a global qualifier, had not played a game for three years since securing their place in the event, and some of their players had never met before the squad assembled in Oman.\nIreland finished top of their group to secure a place in the semi-finals. The UAE also qualified for the semi-finals as runners-up in their group despite a two-run, defeat to Bahrain in their last game. Vriitya Aravind scored 24 runs in the final over to ensure that the UAE finished the group with a superior net run rate than Bahrain. Nepal finished top of the other group as the only unbeaten side in the group stage, with Oman also progressing as runners-up. In the semi-finals, Ireland beat Oman by 56 runs, and the UAE beat Nepal by 68 runs, with both teams qualifying for the T20 World Cup. The UAE beat Ireland in the final by seven wickets, following a century from Muhammad Waseem. Although both finalists had already secured their places at the T20 World Cup, the result of the final determined the groups in which they would be placed.","content":"#Squads\n#Group stage\n##Group A\n##Group B\n#Consolation play-offs\n##Bracket\n##5th Place semi-finals\n##7th-place play-off\n##5th-place play-off\n#Play-offs\n##Bracket\n##Semi-finals\n##3rd-place play-off\n##Final\n#Final standings\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}
{"title":"Giorgio_Napolitano","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Giorgio_Napolitano","summary":"Giorgio Napolitano (Italian: [ˈdʒordʒo napoliˈtaːno]; 29 June 1925 – 22 September 2023) was an Italian politician who served as the 11th president of Italy from 2006 to 2015, the first to be re-elected to the office. In office for 8 years and 244 days, he was the longest-serving president, until the record was surpassed by Sergio Mattarella in 2023. He also was the longest-lived president in the history of the Italian Republic, which has been in existence since 1946. Although he was a prominent figure of the First Italian Republic, he did not take part in the Constituent Assembly of Italy that drafted the Italian constitution; he is considered one of the symbols of the Second Italian Republic, which came about after the Tangentopoli scandal of the 1990s. Due to his dominant position in Italian politics, some critics have sometimes referred to him as Re Giorgio (\"King Giorgio\").\nNapolitano was a longtime member of the Italian Communist Party, which he joined in 1945 after taking part in the Italian resistance movement, and of its post-Communist democratic socialist and social democratic successors, from the Democratic Party of the Left to the Democrats of the Left. He was a leading member of migliorismo, a reformist, moderate, and modernizing faction on the right-wing of the PCI, which was inspired by the values of democratic socialism, looked favourably to social democracy, and was interested in revisionist Marxism. First elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1953, he took an assiduous interest in parliamentary life and was president of the Chamber of Deputies from 1992 to 1994. He was Minister of the Interior from 1996 to 1998 during the first Prodi government. A close friend of Henry Kissinger, he was also the first high-ranking leader of a communist party to visit the United States, which he did in 1978.\nIn 2005, Napolitano was appointed a senator for life in Italy by then president Carlo Azeglio Ciampi. In the May 2006 Italian presidential election, he was elected by the Italian Parliament as president of Italy. A pro-Europeanist, Napolitano was the first former Communist to hold said office. During his first term in office, he oversaw governments both of the centre-left coalition, such as the second Prodi government, and the centre-right coalition, such as the fourth Berlusconi government. In November 2011, Silvio Berlusconi resigned as prime minister of Italy amid financial and economic problems. In keeping with his constitutional role, Napolitano then asked former European commissioner Mario Monti to form a cabinet, which critics referred to as a \"government of the president\".\nNapolitano intended to retire from politics after his seven-year presidential term expired, but reluctantly agreed to run again in the 2013 presidential election to safeguard the continuity of the country's institutions during the parliamentary deadlock that followed the February 2013 Italian general election. He was the first sitting president to run for a second term. On being re-elected as president with broad cross-party support in Parliament, he overcame the impasse by inviting Enrico Letta to propose a grand coalition government. When Letta handed in his resignation in February 2014, Napolitano mandated Matteo Renzi (Letta's factional challenger) to form a new government. After a record eight and a half years as president, citing age factors, the 89-year-old Napolitano resigned in January 2015. He had already stated that he did not intend to serve out a full second term. He then resumed his Italian Senate seat, which he held until his death in 2023.\nNapolitano was often accused by his critics of having transformed a largely ceremonial role into a political and executive one, acting as kingmaker during his political tenure. Supporters instead credited him with saving Italy from the brink of default during the European debt crisis and subsequent political stalemates, which helped to stabilize the country. At the time of his death in 2023, he was the longest-serving Italian President as well as the longest-lived Italian President on record. He was also the oldest head of state in Europe and the third oldest in the world, behind the Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe and Abdullah of Saudi Arabia. A state funeral in secular form was held for Napolitano on 22 September 2023.","content":"#Early life\n#Early political career\n##World War II and anti-fascist resistance\n##From post-war years to the Hungarian Revolution of 1956\n#Leading member of the Italian Communist Party\n##From the 1960s to 1980s\n#After the Italian Communist Party\n##President of the Chamber of Deputies\n##Late 1990s and early 2000s\n#President of Italy\n##First term (2006–2013)\n###Election\n###Prodi Cabinet\n###2008 political crisis\n###Eluana Englaro incident\n###2011 political crisis\n##Second term (2013–2015)\n###Re-election\n###Letta Cabinet\n###Renzi Cabinet\n##Resignation\n##Later life\n#Personal life\n##Relations with the Catholic Church\n##Death and state funeral\n#Legacy\n#Electoral history\n##First-past-the-post elections\n##Presidential elections\n#Honours\n##National honours\n##Foreign honours\n#See also\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Judiciary_of_Poland","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Judiciary_of_Poland","summary":"The judiciary of Poland (Polish: sądownictwo w Polsce [sɔn.dɔvˈɲi.t͡stfɔ v ˈpɔl.st͡sɛ]) are the authorities exercising the judicial power of the Polish state on the basis of Chapter 8 of the Constitution of Poland. As in almost all countries of continental Europe, the Polish judiciary operates within the framework of civil law.\nThe courts (sądy), designated by the Constitution as those exercising the administration of justice (wymiar sprawiedliwości), are the bodies that review the vast majority of cases, with the exception of those specifically assigned to the two tribunals (trybunały). The courts are formally divided into common courts (sądy powszechne) which are the courts that have jurisdiction covering all matters other than those specifically assigned to other courts (and thus include civil, commercial, labour and social insurance law disputes as well as most criminal cases), administrative courts (sądy administracyjne), which review complaints challenging the legality of administrative proceedings and their outcomes, and the military courts (sądy wojskowe), which serve as criminal courts for the military. The Supreme Court is considered distinct from the common or military courts, in spite of its role as the court of last resort in all non-administrative cases; at the same time, the Supreme Administrative Court is the top court for administrative matters. Everyone has a guaranteed right to appeal to a court of higher instance, but appeals and cassations to the apex courts are limited by law; therefore, only a fraction of cases may reach them.\nThere are currently two tribunals established by the Constitution, namely the Constitutional Tribunal (Trybunał Konstytucyjny) and the State Tribunal (Trybunał Stanu), which are separate from the rest of the judiciary. The former rules on the compliance of challenged statutes with the Constitution and is the only court in Poland empowered with striking down acts and regulations which it deems unconstitutional. The State Tribunal has exclusive jurisdiction over indictments for crimes committed by the highest state officials, but it convenes very rarely.\nCourt judges in Poland are appointed by the president of Poland upon nomination by the National Council of the Judiciary (Krajowa Rada Sądownictwa), an auxiliary body established for this purpose by the Constitution, and generally serve until they reach the age of 65 or 70. They are assisted or supplemented by various other judicial officials in the court, including court assessors, law clerks (asystent), registrars (referendarz) and lay judges (ławnik). Professionals such as bailiffs (komornik sądowy) and probation officers (kurator sądowy) act on the court's behalf to enforce judges' orders. In contrast to the court judges, the ones sitting in tribunals (with the exception of those sitting there ex officio) are elected by the Sejm with a simple majority of its deputies.\nSeveral issues plague the Polish judiciary. The courts are widely seen to be too slow, and the trust in the court system is low among the general population. Changes to the judiciary carried out from 2015 by the ruling United Right coalition, ostensibly aimed at remedying these handicaps, caused much controversy and provoked an ongoing constitutional crisis. The conservative government is generally accused, in Poland as well as internationally, of trying to take over the courts, which created a conflict between judges appointed before the Law and Justice-led coalition made changes to the judiciary and their supporters and those appointed by the new rules. The disciplinary system, widely considered to be non-independent, has in particular drawn condemnation and led the European Court of Justice (ECJ) to order the suspension of the Disciplinary Chamber of the Supreme Court and to impose a €1-million-per-day fine since Poland did not comply with the order. The Constitutional Tribunal, widely seen as captured by the Law and Justice party, has issued decisions aiming to thwart the application of the unfavourable rulings of the ECJ and the European Court of Human Rights by asserting they were issued outside the courts' competences and without regard to the Polish Constitution.","content":"#Structure\n##Common courts\n##Military courts\n##Supreme Court\n##Administrative courts\n##Constitutional Tribunal\n##State Tribunal\n#Procedure\n#Staff\n##Judges and court assessors\n###National Council of the Judiciary\n####Procedure of appointment\n####Rights and duties\n##Judges sitting in the tribunals\n##Other judicial positions\n##Remuneration\n#Minimal requirements\n#Issues\n##Length of proceedings\n##Lack of popular support and trust\n##Other issues\n##Rule of law concerns\n###Capture of the Constitutional Tribunal\n###Undue influence on judges\n###Partisan control of the National Council of the Judiciary\n####Arbitrary secondment of judges\n###Repercussions in Poland and abroad\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"2023_Chinese_balloon_incident","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2023_Chinese_balloon_incident","summary":"From January 28 to February 4, 2023, a high-altitude balloon originating from China flew across North American airspace, including Alaska, western Canada, and the contiguous United States. On February 4, the U.S. Air Force shot down the balloon over U.S. territorial waters off the coast of South Carolina. Debris from the wreckage was recovered and sent to the FBI Laboratory in Quantico, Virginia, for analysis. Following a preliminary analysis of the debris in June, U.S. officials stated that the balloon carried intelligence-gathering equipment but does not appear to have sent information back to China. U.S. President Joe Biden described the balloon as carrying two railroad cars' equivalent of spy equipment, however stated that it was \"not a major breach\", and that he also believed that the Chinese leadership was not aware of the balloon. The U.S. government said the balloon had a propeller for maneuverability.\nWhen the object was first spotted, the Pentagon characterized it as a surveillance balloon. The Chinese government maintained it was a civilian (mainly meteorological) airship that had been blown off course. According to U.S. officials, the balloon carried antennas and other equipment capable of geolocating communications signals, and similar balloons from China have flown over more than 40 nations. Analysts said that its flight path and structural characteristics were dissimilar from those of a typical weather balloon. American officials later disclosed that they had been tracking the balloon since it was launched from Hainan and its original destinations were likely Guam and Hawaii, but prevailing winds blew it off course and across North America.\nThe incident increased U.S.–China tensions. The United States called the balloon's presence a violation of its sovereignty, and its Secretary of State Antony Blinken postponed a long-awaited diplomatic visit to Beijing. Canada summoned the Chinese ambassador in response to the incident.\nForensics of the wreckage have confirmed that the balloon's sensors had never been activated while it was flying over the continental US, and so it did not transmit any intelligence back to China. In December 2023, NBC news reported that according to US intelligence officials, the balloon had made use of a commercially available American internet service provider to communicate, and that it was \"primarily for navigation\".\nThree other high-altitude objects, over Northern Alaska (February 10), Yukon (February 11), and Lake Huron (February 11–12) respectively, were detected and subsequently shot down; a later assessment said they had no relation to China.","content":"#Background\n##History and development of reconnaissance balloons\n###Past Chinese balloons and unidentified objects\n##U.S.–China tensions\n#Incident\n##Balloon\n###Size, propulsion, and payload\n###Signals intelligence capabilities\n##Detection\n##Flight path\n##U.S. monitoring and counterintelligence\n##Downing\n##Debris recovery\n#Legality of airspace and downing\n#Response and reactions\n##United States\n##Canada\n##China\n##NATO\n##Australia\n##Japan\n##Singapore\n##United Kingdom\n##Venezuela\n##Media reactions\n###Analysis\n###Satire\n#Other high-altitude objects in February 2023\n#Additional assessments of the balloon\n#See also\n#Notes\n","lang":"en"}

It was his first major title. He claimed the world No. 1 singles ranking with the win; Ruud, Rafael Nadal, Daniil Medvedev, and Stefanos Tsitsipas were also in contention for the top position. Alcaraz saved a match point en route to the title, in the quarterfinals against Jannik Sinner. Alcaraz became the youngest major champion since Nadal at the 2005 French Open, the youngest US Open champion since Pete Sampras in 1990, the first man born in the 2000s to win a major singles title, and the youngest man to be ranked world No. 1, surpassing Lleyton Hewitt's record. At 23 hours and 39 minutes of play duration across his seven matches, Alcaraz spent the longest time on court in major history (a record later broken by Medvedev at the 2024 Australian Open). Ruud became the first Norwegian to reach the final.\nMedvedev was the defending champion, but lost in the fourth round to Nick Kyrgios. Medvedev became the first man outside the Big Four to be the top seed at a major since Andy Roddick at the 2004 Australian Open.\nThis marked the third consecutive US Open where a player claimed his first major title, after Dominic Thiem in 2020 and Medvedev in 2021.

Sinner became the youngest man to reach the quarterfinals at all four majors since Novak Djokovic in 2008. \nNadal was vying for a record-extending 23rd major singles title, but lost in the fourth round to Tiafoe. That marked the first US Open since 2000 and the first major since the 2017 Australian Open with neither of the top two seeded men reaching the quarterfinals. This was also Nadal's final professional appearance at the US Open.\nThree-time champion and nine-time finalist Djokovic withdrew prior to the tournament as he could not travel to the United States, due to not having complied with the federal government's vaccination policy for non-US citizens against COVID-19.\nThis was the first edition of US Open to feature a 10-point tie-break, when the score reaches six games all in the deciding set.

The accident occurred around 19:00 IST when Coromandel Express, a passenger train, collided with a stationary goods train near Bahanaga Bazar railway station on the Howrah–Chennai main line. Due to the high speed of the passenger train and the heavy tonnage of the goods train, the impact resulted in 21 coaches of the Coromandel Express derailing and three of those collided with the oncoming SMVT Bengaluru–Howrah Superfast Express on the adjacent track.\n296 people were killed in the crash and more than 1,200 were injured. It was one of the deadliest railway accidents in India. National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and Odisha Disaster Rapid Action Force (ODRAF) were involved in the search and recovery efforts, assisted by other government agencies and the general public. The injured were treated at local hospitals in the region. In the aftermath, operations of more than 150 trains were impacted, with the cancellation of at least 48 trains. The rail services resumed on the line on 5 June after restoration work.\nPreliminary investigation revealed that the Coromandel Express entered a passing loop line instead of the main line at full speed and crashed into the stationary goods train. In the aftermath, Railway Minister stated that a change in electronic interlocking due to an error in electronic signalling, caused the crash. He also said that sabotage was suspected and the railway board had recommended a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI)-led probe. On 7 July 2023, the CBI arrested three railway officials believed to be responsible for the accident.\nDespite the statement of the railway authorities that the accident was not a reflection of the safety issues in the system, various questions were raised by journalists, politicians and retired railway employees. The railway lines were not equipped with the Kavach train protection system. It was made aware that a similar signalling error had been reported earlier in February 2023 and a December 2022 report by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India had warned that the safety department of the railways lacked adequate staffing and funding, suffered from misuse of funds and that these could impact the quality of maintenance.","content":"#Crash\n#Emergency response\n#Victims\n#Aftermath\n#Investigation\n#Reactions\n#See also\n#References\n##Primary sources\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

Oil and gas licensees are liable for the responsible and safe closure and clean-up of their oil and gas well sites under the Polluter Pays Principle (PPP) as a legal asset retirement obligation (ARO). An operator's liability for surface reclamation issues continues for 25 years following the issuance of a site reclamation certificate. There is also a lifelong liability in case of contamination. \nOnce the current environmental legislation was in place, and the industry-led and industry-funded Orphan Wells Association (OWA), was established in 2002, some orphan wells became the OWA's responsibility. OWA's Inventory does not include legacy wells which are more complex, time-intensive and costly to remediate. Following the 2014 downturn in the global price of oil, there was a \"tsunami\" of orphaned wells, facilities, and pipelines resulting from bankruptcies. \nAs of March 2023, oil and gas companies owe rural municipalities $268 million in unpaid taxes; they owe landowners \"tens of millions in unpaid lease payments\". Original owners of what are now orphan wells \"failed to fulfill their responsibility for costly end-of-life decommissioning and restoration work\"; some sold these wells \"strategically to insolvent operators\". Landowners suffer both \"environmental and economic consequences\" of having these wells on their property. OWA funding is underfunded by at least several hundred million. The total estimate for cleaning up all existing sites is as much as $260 billion.

{"title":"2023_United_States_banking_crisis","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2023_United_States_banking_crisis","summary":"The 2023 United States banking crisis was a series of bank failures and bankruptcies that took place in early 2023, with the United States federal government ultimately intervening in several ways.  Over the course of five days in March 2023, three small-to-mid size U.S. banks failed, triggering a sharp decline in global bank stock prices and swift response by regulators to prevent potential global contagion. Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) failed when a bank run was triggered after it sold its Treasury bond portfolio at a large loss, causing depositor concerns about the bank's liquidity. The bonds had lost significant value as market interest rates rose after the bank had shifted its portfolio to longer-maturity bonds. The bank's clientele was primarily technology companies and wealthy individuals holding large deposits, but balances exceeding $250,000 were not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Silvergate Bank and Signature Bank, both with significant exposure to cryptocurrency, failed in the midst of turbulence in that market.\nIn response to the bank failures, the three major U.S. federal bank regulators announced in a joint communiqué that extraordinary measures would be taken to ensure that all deposits at Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank would be honored. The Federal Reserve established a Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) to offer loans of up to one year to eligible depository institutions pledging qualifying assets as collateral.\nTo prevent the situation from affecting more banks, global industry regulators, including the Federal Reserve, the Bank of Canada, Bank of England, Bank of Japan, European Central Bank, and Swiss National Bank intervened to provide extraordinary liquidity.\nBy March 16, large interbank flows of funds were occurring to shore up bank balance sheets and some analysts were talking of a possibly broader U.S. banking crisis. The Federal Reserve discount window liquidity facility had experienced approximately $150 billion in borrowing from various banks by March 16.\nSoon after the bank run at SVB, depositors quickly began withdrawing cash from San Francisco-based First Republic Bank (FRB), which focused on private banking to wealthy clientele. Like SVB, FRB had substantial uninsured deposits exceeding $250,000; such deposits constituted 68% of the bank's total at year-end 2022, declining to 27% by the end of March, as $100 billion in uninsured deposits were withdrawn. Despite a $30 billion capital infusion from a group of major banks in March, FRB continued to destabilize and its stock price plummeted as the FDIC prepared to take it into receivership and find a buyer on April 29. On May 1, the FDIC announced that First Republic had been closed and sold to JPMorgan Chase.","content":"#Background\n#Liquidation of Silvergate Bank\n##Background\n##Events\n#Collapse of Silicon Valley Bank\n##Background\n##Events\n#Collapse of Signature Bank\n##Background\n##Events\n#Collapse of First Republic Bank\n##Background\n##Events\n#Aftermath\n##Bank Term Funding Program\n##Government discussion of other funding\n##U.S. investigations\n##Economic impact\n##International impact\n#See also\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Jurassic_World_Dominion","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jurassic_World_Dominion","summary":"Jurassic World Dominion is a 2022 American science fiction action film directed by Colin Trevorrow, who co-wrote the screenplay with Emily Carmichael from a story by Derek Connolly and Trevorrow. The sequel to Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom (2018), it is the third installment in the Jurassic World series and the sixth installment overall in the Jurassic Park film series, concluding the storyline that began with Jurassic Park (1993). Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, BD Wong, Daniella Pineda, Justice Smith, Isabella Sermon, and Omar Sy reprise their roles from the previous films, along with Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, and Sam Neill, who appear together for the first time since the original Jurassic Park.\nThe film is set four years after the events of Fallen Kingdom, with dinosaurs now living alongside humans around the world. It follows Owen Grady and Claire Dearing as they embark on a rescue mission, while Alan Grant, Ellie Sattler, and Ian Malcolm work to expose a conspiracy by the genomics corporation Biosyn. Planning for the film began in 2014, before the release of the first Jurassic World film. Filming took place from February to November 2020 in Vancouver, Canada, England's Pinewood Studios, Malta and Switzerland. Legendary Pictures was not involved in the film's production due to the expiration of its four-year partnership with Universal. With an estimated budget of $265 million, it is one of the most expensive films ever made.\nJurassic World Dominion premiered in Mexico City on May 23, 2022, and was released in the United States by Universal Pictures on June 10, 2022. It received generally negative reviews from critics, though the extended edition was met more positively. However, like its predecessors, the film was a financial success and grossed over $1 billion worldwide, becoming the third-highest-grossing film of 2022. It was also the third film released in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic to reach the $1 billion milestone. A standalone sequel titled Jurassic World Rebirth, without Trevorrow's involvement directed by Gareth Edwards and featuring an all new main cast is scheduled for release in 2025.","content":"#Plot\n#Cast\n#Production\n##Development\n##Pre-production\n##Writing\n##Casting\n##Filming\n###COVID-19 pandemic\n###Locations and sets\n##Creatures on screen\n##Post-production\n#Music\n#Marketing\n#Release\n##Theaters\n##Home media\n#Reception\n##Box office\n##Critical response\n##Accolades\n#Future\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Gheorghe_Pintilie","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gheorghe_Pintilie","summary":"Gheorghe Pintilie (born Panteley Timofiy Bodnarenko, Ukrainian: Пантелей Тимофій Боднаренко; also rendered as Pintilie Bodnarenco, nicknamed Pantiușa; November 9, 1902 – August 21, 1985) was a Soviet and Romanian intelligence agent and political assassin, who served as first head of the Securitate (1948–1958). Born as a subject of the Russian Empire in Tiraspol, he was briefly employed as a manual laborer, and trained as a locksmith, before joining the Red Army cavalry and seeing action in the Russian Civil War. The NKVD shortlisted him for espionage missions in the 1920s, and in 1928 sent him on for such clandestine work in the Kingdom of Romania. Bodnarenko was apprehended there some nine years later, and sentenced to a twenty-years' imprisonment. While at Doftana, he became the ringleader of imprisoned Soviet spies, together with whom he joined the Romanian Communist Party (PCR). He expressed his loyalty toward Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, the jailed communist and emerging factional leader; their tight political camaraderie lasted into the late 1950s.\nStaging a walk-out from Caransebeș Prison just after the coup of August 23, 1944, Bodnarenko was integrated by the Patriotic Combat Formations and the Siguranța police, while also reuniting with Soviet intelligence and joining a special unit of the SMERSH. In 1946, he personally killed and buried three of Gheorghiu-Dej's rivals, including Ștefan Foriș, the former PCR General Secretary. From August 1948, Emil Bodnăraș tasked him with forming the Securitate and leading its General Directorate (DGSP), thus ensuring Soviet control over Romania's intelligence agencies. Under the newly formed communist regime, Bodnarenko was exclusively known as \"Gheorghe Pintilie\" (or variants thereof), being promoted directly to Lieutenant General, and serving in the Great National Assembly. Participating in the country's communization, he spearheaded the violent campaigns against the perceived class enemies—conceptualizing \"reeducation\" through penal labor on the Danube–Black Sea Canal, and initiating the first-ever Bărăgan deportations. Pintilie and his adjutant Alexandru Nicolschi also played a part in the Pitești Experiment, which introduced extreme violence with the goal of brainwashing inmates (primarily those detained for their past in the Iron Guard)—though it remains unclear whether they willingly stoked such violence, or just allowed it to happen.\nIn engineering the DGSP, General Pintilie surrounded himself with men of working-class origin, who became notorious for their brutality, but also their overall incompetence—particularly in dealing with the anti-communist guerillas. Both inside and outside the PCR, Pintilie himself was remembered as an uneducated alcoholic; his preference for orality ensured that the more compromising orders he gave remained unattested. Especially during the early 1950s, he assisted Gheorghiu-Dej in the inner-party struggles, helping to topple Ana Pauker and Vasile Luca, and simultaneously framing, then executing, Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu. Witnesses of these purges remain divided as to Pintilie's exact role, with some reporting that he vacillated when it came to exercising full repression, and others suggesting that he exacerbated the violence, beyond what was required of him. In the late 1950s, his projects were being vetoed by the PCR Central Committee, just as Gheorghiu-Dej was proceeding with Romania's emancipation from the Soviet sphere. In 1959, Pintilie lost his Securitate offices and was assigned to lead the Miliția, a more civilian-controlled component of the national police force.\nPushed into full retirement during the anti-Soviet backlash of 1963, Pintilie then watched as Gheorghiu-Dej's posthumous successor, Nicolae Ceaușescu, proceeded to expose some of the crimes committed by Securitate personnel in previous decades. He cooperated in the investigation, openly discussing some of his individual crimes, but was never questioned regarding his involvement in mass purges; the only repercussions he faced were political, leading to his expulsion from the PCR in 1968. Though his wife Ana Toma was allowed a return to the forefront of political life, Pintilie himself lived the remainder of his life in relative obscurity. The Ceaușescu regime still bestowed him with the Order of Tudor Vladimirescu, Second Class, and granted him military honors upon his death in 1985.","content":"#Biography\n##Youth and imprisonment\n##Communist rise\n##DGSP creation\n##Pushing for atrocities\n##Brainwashing experiment\n##In the power struggles\n##Political isolation\n##Downfall\n#Notes\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"2023–2024_Manipur_violence","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2023–2024_Manipur_violence","summary":"On 3 May 2023, ethnic violence erupted in India's north-eastern state of Manipur between the Meitei people, a majority that lives in the Imphal Valley, and the Kuki-Zo tribal community from the surrounding hills. According to government figures, as of 3 May 2024, 221 people have been killed in the violence and 60,000 people have been displaced. Earlier figures also mentioned over 1,000  injured, and 32 missing. 4,786 houses were burnt and 386 religious structures were vandalized, including temples and churches. Unofficial figures are higher.\nThe proximate cause of the violence was a row over an affirmative action measure. On 14 April 2023, acting on a writ petition, the Manipur High Court ordered the state government to send a recommendation to the central government on the demand for a Scheduled Tribe status by the valley-based Meitei community, a decision later criticised by the Supreme Court. To protest the Meitei demands for the scheduled tribe status, the All Tribal Students' Union Manipur conducted peaceful protest marches on 3 May. After one of these marches, clashes broke out between Kuki and Meitei groups near the border between the Churachandpur district and Bishnupur district, followed by house burning.\nThe violence quickly spread to the Kuki-dominated Churachandpur town and the Meitei-dominated Imphal Valley, targeting the minority community in each area. According to Reuters, 77 Kukis and 10 Meiteis were killed within a week.\nIn addition to the ST status, other issues had been festering prior to the violence. For example, the Kuki people in the hill districts saw themselves as being the target of the state government's treatment of indigenous land rights concerns.\nThere have been evictions of Kuki communities as a result of efforts to survey forests, which were ostensibly made to stop the cultivation of poppy.\nThe Meitei community has also experienced a rise in insecurity as a result of the flood of refugees from Myanmar following the military coup in 2021, particularly those from the Sagaing region. In one of the instances, the Manipur government have questioned the central security forces, especially the Assam Rifles, of allowing illegal immigration from Myanmar. Many organisations have protested against Assam Rifles of siding with the Kuki communities, including instance of Manipur police filing FIR against its personnel for enabling Kuki militants to escape by obstructing the police movements.\nAccording to several organisations, there have been accounts of partisan killings by security forces, as well as allegations of the police siding with the Meitei community.","content":"#Background\n##Scheduled Tribe status for Meitei\n##Political background\n##Refugees from Myanmar\n##International factors\n#Antecedents\n#Overview\n##Initial riots\n##Government response\n##Recurrent violence\n##Warring groups\n##Casualties and victims\n#Supreme Court proceedings\n#Reactions\n#Media coverage\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}
{"title":"The_Maiden_in_the_Tower","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Maiden_in_the_Tower","summary":"The Maiden in the Tower (in Swedish: Jungfrun i tornet; in Finnish: Neito tornissa; occasionally translated to English as The Maid in the Tower), JS 101, is an opera (\"dramatized Finnish ballad\") in one act—comprising an overture and eight scenes—written in 1896 by the Finnish composer Jean Sibelius. The piece was a collaboration with the Finnish author Rafael Hertzberg, the Swedish-language libretto of whom tells a \"simple tale of chivalry\" that may nonetheless have had allegorical ambitions: the Bailiff (Imperial Russia) abducts and imprisons the Maiden (the Grand Duchy of Finland); although she endures hardship, she remains true to herself and is freed subsequently (Finland's independence) by her Lover (Finnish nationalists) and the Chatelaine of the castle (social reformers).\nThe opera premiered on 7 November 1896 at a lottery soirée to benefit the Helsinki Philharmonic Society, which Sibelius conducted, and its music school; the Finnish baritone Abraham Ojanperä and the Finnish soprano Ida Flodin sang the roles of the Bailiff and the Maiden, respectively. Although the critics praised Sibelius's music, they thought it was wasted on Hertzberg's lifeless libretto. After three performances, Sibelius withdrew the opera, saying he wanted to revise it. He never did, and with one exception (in 1900, he conducted a 12-minute concert overture that incorporated material from five of the opera's numbers), he suppressed the work. (In 1914, for example, he quashed the Finnish soprano Aino Ackté's plans for a revival in Mikkeli.) The Maiden in the Tower would not receive its next complete performance until 28 January 1981, when Sibelius's son-in-law Jussi Jalas and the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra resurrected it for a radio concert.\nIn the intervening decades, The Maiden in the Tower has entered neither the Finnish nor the international repertories, and its significance is therefore primarily as a historical curiosity: Sibelius's lone opera. Accordingly, it has been recorded only a few times, with Neeme Järvi and the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra having made the world premiere studio recording in 1983. A typical performance lasts about 36 minutes.","content":"#History\n##Composition\n##Premiere\n##Withdrawal and suppression\n##Posthumous revival\n#Structure and roles\n#Synopsis\n#Music\n#Context and analysis\n##The plot as allegory\n##Opera and Finland's language strife\n##Later opinions of Sibelius's music\n##Reasons for post-1981 neglect\n#Discography\n#Notes, references, and sources\n","lang":"en"}

He played as a fullback for the Cleveland Browns of the National Football League (NFL) from 1957 to 1965. Considered one of the greatest running backs of all time, as well as one of the greatest players in NFL history, Brown was a Pro Bowl invitee every season he was in the league, was recognized as the AP NFL Most Valuable Player three times. Brown won an NFL championship with the Browns in 1964. He led the league in rushing yards in eight out of his nine seasons, and by the time he retired, he held most major rushing records. In 2002, he was named by The Sporting News as the greatest professional football player ever.\nBrown earned unanimous All-America honors playing college football at Syracuse University, where he was an all-around player for the Syracuse Orangemen football team. The team later retired his number 44 jersey, and he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1995.

{"title":"Assassination_of_Shinzo_Abe","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Assassination_of_Shinzo_Abe","summary":"On 8 July 2022, Shinzo Abe, a former prime minister of Japan and serving member of the Japanese House of Representatives, was assassinated while speaking at a political event outside Yamato-Saidaiji Station in Nara City, Nara Prefecture. Abe was delivering a campaign speech for a Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) candidate when he was fatally shot by 41-year-old Tetsuya Yamagami with an improvised firearm. Abe was transported via medical helicopter to Nara Medical University Hospital in Kashihara, where he was pronounced dead.\nLeaders from many nations expressed shock and dismay at Abe's assassination, which was the first of a former Japanese prime minister since Saitō Makoto and Takahashi Korekiyo during the 26 February incident in 1936, as well as the first of a major political figure in Japan since Inejiro Asanuma's assassination in 1960. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida decided to hold a state funeral for Abe on 27 September. Yamagami was arrested at the scene and charged with attempted murder, which was upgraded to murder after Abe's death was confirmed. Yamagami told investigators that he had shot Abe in relation to a grudge he held against the Unification Church (UC), a new religious movement to which Abe and his family had political ties, over his mother's bankruptcy in 2002.\nThe assassination brought scrutiny from Japanese society and media against the UC's alleged practice of pressuring believers into making exorbitant donations. Japanese dignitaries and legislators were forced to disclose their relationship with the UC, and Kishida was forced to reshuffle his cabinet amid plummeting public approval. On 31 August, the LDP announced that it would no longer have any relationship with the UC and its associated organisations, and would expel members who did not break ties with the group. On 10 December, the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors passed two bills to restrict the activities of religious organisations such as the UC and provide relief to victims.\nAbe's killing has been described as one of the most effective and successful political assassinations in recent history due to the backlash against the UC that it provoked. The Economist remarked that  \"... Yamagami's political violence has proved stunningly effective ... Political violence seldom fulfils so many of its perpetrator's aims.\" Writing for The Atlantic, Robert F. Worth described Yamagami as \"among the most successful assassins in history.\"","content":"#Background\n##Relationship between Abe's family and the Unification Church\n##Unification Church practices in Japan\n#Timeline\n##Abe's schedule\n##Attack\n##Treatment\n##Death declaration\n##Visitations\n#Suspect\n#Aftermath\n##Effects on election\n##Effects on media broadcast\n##National Police Agency changes\n##Resignation\n##Unification Church–related\n###Responses by the Unification Church\n###Responses from the Kishida Cabinet\n###Civil responses\n###Examination of dissolving the Unification Church\n###Legislation to restrict donations to religious organisations and provide relief to victims\n###Criticism on media integrity\n##Other impacts\n#Wake and funeral\n##State funeral\n###Attendees\n###Reactions to state funeral\n###Memorial\n#Misinformation\n#Copycat threats\n#Reactions\n##Domestic\n##International\n##Individuals, non-governmental organisations and sports\n#See also\n#Notes\n","lang":"en"}

The wind-driven fires prompted evacuations and caused widespread damage, killing at least 102 people and leaving two people missing in the town of Lahaina on Maui's northwest coast. The proliferation of the wildfires was attributed to dry, gusty conditions created by a strong high-pressure area north of Hawaii and Hurricane Dora to the south.\nAn emergency declaration was signed on August 8, authorizing several actions, including activation of the Hawaii National Guard, appropriate actions by the director of the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency and the Administrator of Emergency Management, and the expenditure of state general revenue funds for relief of conditions created by the fires. By August 9, the state government of Hawaii issued a state of emergency for the entirety of the state. On August 10, U.S. President Joe Biden issued a federal major disaster declaration.\nFor the Lahaina fire alone, the Pacific Disaster Center (PDC) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) estimated that over 2,200 buildings had been destroyed, overwhelmingly residential and including many historic landmarks in Lahaina.

{"title":"July_2022_United_Kingdom_government_crisis","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/July_2022_United_Kingdom_government_crisis","summary":"In early July 2022, 62 of the United Kingdom's 179 government ministers, parliamentary private secretaries, trade envoys, and party vice-chairmen resigned from their positions in the second administration formed by Boris Johnson as Prime Minister, culminating in Johnson's resignation on 7 July. Johnson's premiership had been considered in danger for months after several scandals, but it was the Chris Pincher scandal that was identified to have spurred on the resignations. Considered the \"last straw\" for the Prime Minister, the scandal arose after it was revealed that Johnson had promoted his Deputy Chief Government Whip Chris Pincher, who was publicly facing multiple allegations of sexual assault, to the position despite knowing of the allegations beforehand.\nSince mid-2021, Johnson's premiership had been impacted by controversies over his actions relating to Owen Paterson's lobbying and the Partygate scandal. These, combined with impacts on electoral performance, led to the governing Conservative Party holding a vote of confidence in Johnson's leadership in June 2022, which he won, although he was politically weakened. On 5 July, following the Chris Pincher scandal, both Rishi Sunak and Sajid Javid, respectively Chancellor of the Exchequer and Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, resigned almost simultaneously. A large number of other members of the government also resigned, leading to speculation over whether Johnson would continue as prime minister. Conservative and opposition MPs, including some members of Johnson's Cabinet, called for Johnson himself to resign. Keir Starmer, Leader of the Opposition, criticised Johnson and Conservatives who remained in cabinet at Prime Minister's Questions. During the crisis, sixty Members of Parliament (MPs) had resigned from government and party positions. Johnson also dismissed Michael Gove, Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, who had refused to publicly affirm his support for him.\nAfter previously saying he would remain as Conservative Party leader to see through the party's manifesto pledges, Johnson announced on 7 July that he would resign as leader but remain as Prime Minister in a caretaker capacity until a new party leader was elected, with the results of the July–September 2022 Conservative Party leadership election being released on 5 September 2022. After the opposition called for a motion of no confidence to the government with Johnson as PM, Johnson's government called a vote of confidence in itself with no reference to the PM, which they won. On 5 September, Liz Truss was elected leader of the Conservative Party and succeeded Johnson as prime minister on 6 September 2022. Truss would resign as leader of the Conservative Party on 20 October 2022 amid another government crisis, making her the shortest-serving prime minister in British history. Truss would be succeeded by Sunak, after he won the leadership contest to replace her.","content":"#Background\n#Collapse of the government\n##Support for Johnson\n#Resignation of Boris Johnson\n#Reactions\n##Domestic\n##International\n#List of departures\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Destruction_of_the_Kakhovka_Dam","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Destruction_of_the_Kakhovka_Dam","summary":"The Kakhovka Dam was breached in the early hours of 6 June 2023, causing extensive flooding along the lower Dnieper river, also called the Dnipro, in Kherson Oblast. The dam was under the control of the Russian military, which had seized it in the early days of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Many experts have concluded that Russian forces likely blew up a segment of the dam to hinder the planned Ukrainian counter-offensive. Russian authorities have denied the accusation.\nThe dam was about 30 m (98 ft) tall and 3.2 km (2 mi) long; the breached segment was about 85 m (279 ft) long. Two days after the breach, the average level of flooding in the Kherson Oblast was 5.61 m (18.4 ft), according to local officials.\nThere were signs of an explosion at the time of the breach. Both Ukrainian and Russian sources reported hearing blasts from the dam's hydroelectric power station, regional seismometers detected explosions in the area, and a satellite detected the infrared heat signature of an explosion.\nWater levels in the Kakhovka Reservoir, controlled by Russia, had been rising for months and were at a 30-year high when the dam failed. Thousands of residents downstream were evacuated, and floods submerged several villages in Ukrainian- and Russian-controlled areas. By 21 June, 58 people were reported to have been killed and 31 were missing. Russian authorities officially report that 59 people drowned in total, but local health workers and a volunteer grave digger from Oleshky have told the Associated Press that the death toll was in the hundreds from that city alone, with shallow mass graves dug for the victims. According to the informants, reporting of deaths in Oleshky was hampered by interference from police beginning June 12, by relocation of bodies and by extortion of families of survivors and coercion of health care workers to misreport causes of death on death certificates, which could not be written in Ukrainian language in Russian-occupied territory or conveyed to Ukrainian authorities. Flooding killed many animals and damaged farmland, homes, businesses, and infrastructure. The loss of water from the reservoir could threaten the long-term water supply to Russian-controlled Crimea and the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, but there was no immediate risk to either.","content":"#Background\n#Destruction\n#Responsibility\n#Effects\n##Casualties\n##Flooding and evacuations\n##Animals and environment\n##Military impact\n##Water supply\n##North Crimean Canal\n##Farming\n##Fisheries\n##Energy\n##Costs of reconstruction\n#Legal responses\n#Reactions\n##Ukrainian reactions\n##Russian reactions\n##International reactions\n#Aftermath\n#See also\n##Similar international events\n##General\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}
{"title":"Eukaryote","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Eukaryote","summary":"The eukaryotes ( yoo-KARR-ee-ohts, -⁠əts) constitute the domain of Eukaryota or Eukarya, organisms whose cells have a membrane-bound nucleus. All animals, plants, fungi, and many unicellular organisms are eukaryotes. They constitute a major group of life forms alongside the two groups of prokaryotes: the Bacteria and the Archaea. Eukaryotes represent a small minority of the number of organisms, but given their generally much larger size, their collective global biomass is much larger than that of prokaryotes.\nThe eukaryotes seemingly emerged within the Asgard archaea, and are  closely related to the Heimdallarchaeia. This implies that there are only two domains of life, Bacteria and Archaea, with eukaryotes incorporated among the Archaea. Eukaryotes first emerged during the Paleoproterozoic, likely as flagellated cells. The leading evolutionary theory is they were created by symbiogenesis between an anaerobic Asgard archaean and an aerobic proteobacterium, which formed the mitochondria. A second episode of symbiogenesis with a cyanobacterium created the plants, with chloroplasts.\nEukaryotic cells contain membrane-bound organelles such as the nucleus, the endoplasmic reticulum, and the Golgi apparatus. Eukaryotes may be either unicellular or multicellular. In comparison, prokaryotes are typically unicellular. Unicellular eukaryotes are sometimes called protists. Eukaryotes can reproduce both asexually through mitosis and sexually through meiosis and gamete fusion (fertilization).","content":"#Diversity\n#Distinguishing features\n##Nucleus\n##Biochemistry\n##Internal membranes\n##Mitochondria\n##Plastids\n##Cytoskeletal structures\n##Cell wall\n##Sexual reproduction\n#Evolution\n##History of classification\n##Phylogeny\n##Origin of eukaryotes\n##Fossils\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}
{"title":"Saul_Gone","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Saul_Gone","summary":"\"Saul Gone\" is the series finale of the American legal crime drama television series Better Call Saul, which is a spin-off of Breaking Bad. The episode is the thirteenth episode of the sixth season and the series' 63rd episode overall. Written and directed by Peter Gould, who co-created the series with Vince Gilligan, the episode first aired on AMC and AMC+ on August 15, 2022, before debuting online in certain territories on Netflix the following day.\n\"Saul Gone\" is primarily set in late 2010, with flashbacks set during Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul. It depicts Jimmy McGill (Bob Odenkirk) facing the consequences of the conflicts caused by his three identities: his actions throughout Better Call Saul under his birth name, the federal crimes he committed for Walter White (Bryan Cranston) throughout Breaking Bad as Saul Goodman, and the schemes he ran in Omaha, Nebraska, as Gene Takavic. The episode also sees Jimmy and Kim Wexler (Rhea Seehorn) meeting for the first time in six years.\nGould and the Better Call Saul writing staff knew the series would end with Jimmy going to prison for his actions in Breaking Bad by the time the fifth-season finale aired in 2020. They sought to differentiate \"Saul Gone\" from Breaking Bad's \"Felina\" (2013) and El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie (2019) with a slower pace and greater focus on dialogue. Several actors from Better Call Saul and Breaking Bad returned for guest appearances, including Cranston as Walt, Betsy Brandt as Marie Schrader, and Michael McKean as Chuck McGill.\nAn estimated 1.80 million household viewers watched this episode when it was first broadcast on AMC. \"Saul Gone\" received acclaim, with critics praising Jimmy's character development and his reconciliation with Kim. Many considered it a \"masterful\" conclusion to the series and one of the best series finales of all time. Gilligan has stated that \"Saul Gone\" is likely the last entry in the Breaking Bad franchise, as he and Gould have no plans for further works continuing it.","content":"#Plot\n#Production\n##Development\n##Casting\n##Writing\n##Filming\n#Themes and motifs\n#Reception\n##Critical response\n##Ratings\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

During World War II, at a time when Romania was an ally of Nazi Germany, he served as the leading Eastern Orthodox clergyman in occupied Transnistria, a territory where several hundred thousand Jews were murdered. In August 1944, when Romania switched sides, he took refuge in Nazi Germany.\nAfter the war, he lived in Italy and Switzerland before finally settling in France. In 1946, he was sentenced to death in absentia by the Bucharest People's Tribunal. He created the Romanian Orthodox Diocese of Western Europe under the authority of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia, and for a few years played an important role in the Romanian diaspora. The Holy Synod in Bucharest defrocked Puiu in 1950, but posthumously restored him among its clergy in 1990.

In May 2022, the International Cricket Council (ICC) confirmed all the fixtures and venues for the three sub-regional Qualifiers.\nThe sub-regional phase of European qualification for the previous T20 World Cup was eventually cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, only four teams had the opportunity to qualify from a regional finals event. Jersey and Germany progressed from that event and thereby gained a bye through the sub-regional stage in the process for the 2024 T20 World Cup.\nIn this cycle, twenty-eight countries from the European region competed in the sub-regional phase of the tournament, divided into three events being played in June and July 2022.

Qualifiers A and B followed, with both of them hosted in Finland between 12 and 31 July 2022.\nThe winner of each sub-regional qualifier progressed to the regional final. Denmark became the first team to advance to the regional final, after they beat Portugal by nine wickets in the final of sub-regional Qualifier C. Italy were the second team to progress to the regional final, when they beat the Isle of Man by seven wickets in the final of sub-regional Qualifier A. Austria were the last team to qualify from the sub-regional matches, after beating Norway in the final of the sub-regional Qualifier B.\nScotland and Ireland enter the regional final as they had failed to qualify directly for the 2024 T20 World Cup.

{"title":"Edward_I_of_England","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Edward_I_of_England","summary":"Edward I (17\/18 June 1239 – 7 July 1307), also known as Edward Longshanks and the Hammer of the Scots, was King of England from 1272 to 1307. Concurrently, he was Lord of Ireland, and from 1254 to 1306 ruled Gascony as Duke of Aquitaine in his capacity as a vassal of the French king. Before his accession to the throne, he was commonly referred to as the Lord Edward. The eldest son of Henry III, Edward was involved from an early age in the political intrigues of his father's reign. In 1259, he briefly sided with a baronial reform movement, supporting the Provisions of Oxford. After reconciling with his father, he remained loyal throughout the subsequent armed conflict, known as the Second Barons' War. After the Battle of Lewes, Edward was held hostage by the rebellious barons, but escaped after a few months and defeated the baronial leader Simon de Montfort at the Battle of Evesham in 1265. Within two years, the rebellion was extinguished and, with England pacified, Edward left to join the Ninth Crusade to the Holy Land in 1270. He was on his way home in 1272 when he was informed of his father's death. Making a slow return, he reached England in 1274 and was crowned at Westminster Abbey.\nEdward spent much of his reign reforming royal administration and common law. Through an extensive legal inquiry, he investigated the tenure of several feudal liberties. The law was reformed through a series of statutes regulating criminal and property law, but the King's attention was increasingly drawn towards military affairs. After suppressing a minor conflict in Wales in 1276–77, Edward responded to a second one in 1282–83 by conquering Wales. He then established English rule, built castles and towns in the countryside and settled them with English people. After the death of the heir to the Scottish throne, Edward was invited to arbitrate a succession dispute. He claimed feudal suzerainty over Scotland and invaded the country, and the ensuing First Scottish War of Independence continued after his death.  Simultaneously, Edward found himself at war with France (a Scottish ally) after King Philip IV confiscated the Duchy of Gascony. The duchy was eventually recovered but the conflict relieved English military pressure against Scotland. By the mid-1290s, extensive military campaigns required high levels of taxation and this met with both lay and ecclesiastical opposition in England. In Ireland, he had extracted soldiers, supplies and money, leaving decay, lawlessness and a revival of the fortunes of his enemies in Gaelic territories. When the King died in 1307, he left to his son Edward II a war with Scotland and other financial and political burdens.\nEdward's temperamental nature and height (6 ft 2 in, 188 cm) made him an intimidating figure. He often instilled fear in his contemporaries, although he held the respect of his subjects for the way he embodied the medieval ideal of kingship as a soldier, an administrator, and a man of faith. Modern historians are divided in their assessment of Edward; some have praised him for his contribution to the law and administration, but others have criticised his uncompromising attitude towards his nobility. Edward is credited with many accomplishments, including restoring royal authority after the reign of Henry III and establishing Parliament as a permanent institution, which allowed for a functional system for raising taxes and reforming the law through statutes. At the same time, he is also often condemned for vindictiveness, opportunism and untrustworthiness in his dealings with Wales and Scotland, coupled with a colonialist approach to their governance and to Ireland, and for antisemitic policies leading to the expulsion of the Jews from England in 1290.","content":"#Early years, 1239–1263\n##Childhood and marriage\n##Early ambitions\n#Civil war and crusades, 1264–1273\n##Second Barons' War\n##Crusade and accession\n#Early reign, 1274–1296\n##Conquest of Wales\n##Diplomacy and war on the Continent\n##Great Cause\n#Government and law\n##Character as king\n##Administration and the law\n##Finances and Parliament\n##Parliament and the expulsion of the Jews\n##Administration in Ireland\n#Later reign, 1297–1307\n##Constitutional crisis\n##Return to Scotland\n##Death and burial\n#Legacy\n#Family\n##First marriage\n##Second marriage\n##Genealogical table\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

Hungary's incumbent prime minister Viktor Orbán won re-election to a fourth term. Addressing his supporters after the partial results showed Fidesz leading by a wide margin, Orbán said: \"We won a victory so big that you can see it from the moon, and you can certainly see it from Brussels.\" Opposition leader Péter Márki-Zay admitted defeat shortly after Orbán's speech. Reuters described it as a \"crushing victory\".\nWith 54.13% of the popular vote, Fidesz received the highest vote share by any party since the Fall of Communism in 1989. The election had been predicted to be closer than in previous years but Fidesz still held a 5–6 percentage point lead in the polls leading up to the vote. OSCE deployed a full monitoring mission for the vote. The results showed that Fidesz outperformed polls, winning its first absolute majority of the vote share since 2010 while expanding its supermajority to control 135 seats of the 199-seat Parliament, comfortably ahead of the opposition alliance United for Hungary, which was set to win 57 seats after 100% of the votes had been counted. The Mi Hazánk party won seats for the first time, obtaining 6 seats.\nInternationally, the election was seen as a victory for right-wing populism with Orbán being an ally of former US President Donald Trump and other right-wing figures.","content":"#Background\n##Amendment of the electoral law\n##Creation of joint opposition list\n##Opposition primary\n#Electoral system\n#Parties and coalitions\n#Opinion polls\n#Results\n##Result by constituency\n##Party list results by county and in the diaspora\n#Aftermath\n##Analysis\n##Conduct\n##Anomalies over postal ballots\n##International responses\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Economics_of_open_science","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Economics_of_open_science","summary":"The economics of open science describe the economic aspects of making a wide range of scientific outputs (publication, data, software) to all levels of society.\nOpen science involves a plurality of economic models and goods. Journals and other academic institutions (like learned societies) have historically favored a knowledge club or a toll access model: publications are managed as a community service for the selected benefit of academic readers and authors. During the second half of the 20th century, the \"big 5\" largest publishers (Elsevier, Springer, Wiley, Taylor & Francis and the American Chemical Society) have partly absorbed or outcompeted non-profits structure and applied an industrial approach to scholarly publishing.\nThe development of the web shifted the focus of scholarly communication from publication to a large variety of outputs (data, software, metrics). It also challenged the values and the organization of existing actors with the development of an international initiatives in favor of open access and open science. While initially distanced by new competitors, the main commercial publishers have started to flip to author-pay models after 2000, funded through article processing charges and the negotiation of transformative deals. Actors like Elsevier or Wiley have diversified their activities from journal ownership to data analytics by developing a vertical integration of tools, database and metrics monitoring academic activities. The structuration of a global open science movement, the enlargement of scientific readership beyond professional researchers and increasing concerns for the sustainability of key infrastructures has enabled the development of open science commons. Journals, platforms, infrastructures and repositories have been increasingly structured around a shared ecosystem of services and self-governance principles.\nThe costs and benefits of open science are difficult to assess due to the coexistence of several economic models and the untraceability of open diffusion. Open publishing is less costly overall than subscription models, on account of reduced externalities and economies of scale. Yet the conversion of leading publishers to open science has entailed a significant increased in article processing charges, as the prestige of well-known journals make it possible to extract a high consent to pay. Open science brings significant efficiency gain to academic research, especially regarding bibliographic and data search, identification of previous findings and text and data mining projects. Theses benefits extend to non-academic research, as open access to data and publications eases the development of new commercial services and products. Although the overall economic and social impact of open science could be high, it has been hardly estimated.\nThe development of open science has created new forms of economic regulations of scientific publishing, as funders and institutions has come to acknowledged that this sector no longer operated in normal market conditions.

The finals tournament were originally scheduled to be held in September 2019, but were moved to March 2020, with the original host city being Nairobi, Kenya. On 9 March 2020, the tournament was postponed again due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in line with the Kenyan government's 30-day ban on international gatherings. The tournament was eventually rescheduled for September 2022.\nThe tournament finals were originally to be contested by the top two teams from each of three regional qualification events, plus South Africa and Zimbabwe as automatic qualifiers. It was later decided to make the tournament open only to associate members of the International Cricket Council, and so two additional teams from the qualifiers would be entered into the finals in place of the two full members. Ghana and Nigeria qualified from the North-Western region in April 2018, with Cameroon later granted an additional place in the finals. Botswana, Malawi and Mozambique progressed from the Southern region in November 2018. The Eastern qualifier was due to be played in Nairobi in July 2018, but did not take place; Kenya and Uganda were automatically advanced to the finals. Shortly before the finals in September 2022, Nigeria were replaced in the tournament by Tanzania.\nAll matches played in the tournament finals had full T20I status as the ICC granted T20I status to matches between all of its members from 1 January 2019.\nUganda defeated Tanzania in the final with Riazat Ali Shah (98*) leading a remarkable chase after the team had needed 49 runs from the last three overs.","content":"#North-Western qualifier\n##Points table\n##Fixtures\n##Semi-finals\n##Final\n#Southern qualifier\n##Points table\n##Fixtures\n#ACA Africa T20 Cup Finals\n##Squads\n##Group stage\n###Group A\n###Group B\n##Semi-finals\n##Final\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}
{"title":"Sandy_Koufax","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sandy_Koufax","summary":"Sanford Koufax (; né Braun; born December 30, 1935), nicknamed \"the Left Arm of God\", is an American former baseball pitcher who played 12 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Brooklyn\/Los Angeles Dodgers from 1955 to 1966. Widely regarded as one of the greatest pitchers in baseball history, Koufax was the first three-time winner of the Cy Young Award, each time winning unanimously and the only pitcher to do so when a single award was given for both the leagues; he was also named the National League Most Valuable Player in 1963. Retiring at the age of 30 due to chronic pain in his pitching elbow, Koufax was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility in 1972 at the age of 36, the youngest player ever elected.\nBorn in Brooklyn, New York, Koufax was primarily a basketball player in his youth and had pitched in only a few games before signing with the Brooklyn Dodgers at age 19. Due to the bonus rule he signed under, Koufax never pitched the minor leagues. His lack of pitching experience caused manager Walter Alston to distrust Koufax who saw inconsistent playing time during his first six seasons. As a result, though he often showed flashes of brilliance, Koufax struggled early on. Frustrated with the way he was being managed by the Dodgers, he almost quit after the 1960 season. After making adjustments prior to the 1961 season, Koufax quickly rose to become the most dominant pitcher in the major leagues, as well as the first major sports star on the West Coast. He was an All-Star in each of his last six seasons, leading the National League (NL) in earned run average each of his last five years, in strikeouts four times, and in wins and shutouts three times each. He was the first pitcher in the live-ball era to post an earned run average below 2.00 in three different qualifying seasons, and the first ever to record a 300-strikeout season three times.\nKoufax won the Major League Triple Crown three times, leading the Dodgers to a pennant in each of those years. He was the first major league pitcher to throw four no-hitters, including a perfect game in 1965. He was named the World Series MVP twice, leading the weak-hitting Dodgers to titles in 1963 and 1965. Despite his comparatively short career, his 2,396 career strikeouts ranked seventh in major league history at the time, trailing only Warren Spahn (2,583) among left-handers; his 40 shutouts were tied for ninth in modern NL history. He was the first pitcher in history to average more than nine strikeouts per nine innings pitched, and the first to allow fewer than seven hits per nine innings pitched. Koufax, along with teammate Don Drysdale, became a pivotal figure in baseball's labor movement when the two staged a joint holdout and demanded a fairer contract from the Dodgers before the 1966 season. Koufax is also considered one of the greatest Jewish athletes in history; his decision to sit out Game 1 of the 1965 World Series because it coincided with the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur garnered national attention and made him an iconic figure within the American Jewish community.\nSince retiring, Koufax has kept a low profile and makes public appearances on rare occasions. In December 1966, he signed a 10-year contract to work as a broadcaster for NBC; uncomfortable in front of cameras and with public speaking, he resigned after six years. In 1979, Koufax returned to work as a pitching coach in the Dodgers' farm system; he resigned from the position in 1990 but continues to make informal appearances during spring training. From 2013 to 2015, Koufax worked in an executive position for the Dodgers, as special advisor to chairman Mark Walter. In 1999, he was named to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. His number 32 was retired by the Dodgers in 1972 and he was honored with a statue outside the centerfield plaza of Dodger Stadium in 2022. That same year, Koufax became the first player to mark the 50th anniversary of his election to the Baseball Hall of Fame.","content":"#Early life\n##Major League tryouts\n#Professional career\n##Early years (1955–1960)\n##Domination (1961–1964)\n###1961 season\n###1962 season\n###1963 season\n##Salary dispute\n###1964 season\n##Playing in pain (1965–66)\n###1965 season\n####Perfection\n####World Series and Yom Kippur decision\n##Holdout\n###1966 season\n##Retirement\n#Career overall\n##Statistics and achievements\n##Pitching style and repertoire\n#Post-playing activities\n#Honors and recognition\n#Legacy\n##Impact within the Jewish community\n##Relationship with fellow minorities\n#In media culture\n##Television appearances\n##Cultural references\n#Personal life\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n##Book sources\n#Further reading\n##Articles\n##Books\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Puss_in_Boots:_The_Last_Wish","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Puss_in_Boots:_The_Last_Wish","summary":"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a 2022 American animated fantasy-adventure comedy film produced by DreamWorks Animation and distributed by Universal Pictures. The sequel to the spin-off film Puss in Boots (2011) and the sixth installment of the Shrek film series, the film was directed by Joel Crawford, co-directed by Januel Mercado (in his feature directorial debut), and written by Paul Fisher, Tommy Swerdlow, and Tom Wheeler. Based on the character introduced in Shrek 2 (2004) and inspired by the fairy tale of the same name, the voice cast includes Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek reprising their respective roles as the titular character and Kitty Softpaws, with new additions to the cast including Harvey Guillén, Florence Pugh, Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone, Samson Kayo, John Mulaney, and Wagner Moura. The story follows Puss in Boots, who teams up with Kitty Softpaws and Perrito to find the Last Wish of the fallen Wishing Star to restore eight of his nine lives. They race against other fairy tale characters seeking the same treasure, while a sinister wolf hunts Puss himself.\nPlans for a sequel to Puss in Boots began in November 2012 but languished in development hell until it was revived in November 2018, with Illumination founder and CEO Chris Meledandri confirmed as an executive producer. It was announced in February 2019 that the film would be helmed by Bob Persichetti, head of story of the first film and co-director of Sony Pictures Animation's Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018). However, Crawford signed on and replaced Persichetti as director in March 2021, along with Mercado. The story draws inspiration from Spaghetti Western films, with The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966) cited as a particular influence. The film's style is inspired by Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. With new technology, the team was able to give the film a painterly style to resemble a fairy-tale story, diverging from the visual style of previous installments in the Shrek franchise.\nFollowing delays due to a restructuring at DreamWorks, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish premiered at Lincoln Center in New York City on November 25, 2022, and was theatrically released in the United States on December 21. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish received critical acclaim, with praise for its animation, story, humor, mature themes, and vocal performances. It was also a box office success, grossing over $485 million worldwide on a production budget of $90–110 million and becoming the tenth-highest-grossing film of 2022. At the 95th Academy Awards it was nominated for Best Animated Feature, as well as receiving nominations at the Golden Globes, Critics' Choice Awards, and British Academy Film Awards.","content":"#Plot\n#Voice cast\n#Production\n##Development\n##Writing\n##Animation and design\n#Analysis\n#Music\n#Release\n##Theatrical\n##Home media and streaming\n#Reception\n##Box office\n##Critical response\n##Accolades\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Anti-Zionism","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Anti-Zionism","summary":"Anti-Zionism is opposition to Zionism. Although anti-Zionism is a heterogeneous phenomenon, all its proponents agree that the creation of the modern State of Israel, and the movement to create a sovereign Jewish state in the region of Palestine—a region partly coinciding with the biblical Land of Israel—was flawed or unjust in some way.\nUntil World War II, anti-Zionism was widespread among Jews for varying reasons. Orthodox Jews opposed Zionism on religious grounds, as preempting the Messiah, while many secular Jewish anti-Zionists identified more with ideals of the Enlightenment and saw Zionism as a reactionary ideology. Opposition to Zionism in the Jewish diaspora was surmounted only from the 1930s onward, as conditions for Jews deteriorated radically in Europe and, with the Second World War, the sheer scale of the Holocaust was felt. Thereafter, Jewish anti-Zionist groups generally either disintegrated or transformed into pro-Zionist organizations, though many small groups, and bodies like the American Council for Judaism, conserved an earlier Reform tradition of rejection of Zionism. Non-Jewish anti-Zionism likewise spanned communal and religious groups, with the Arab populace of Palestine largely opposed to what they considered the colonial dispossession of their homeland. Opposition to Zionism was, and continues to be, widespread in the Arab world, especially among Palestinians.\nMany anti-Zionists seek to replace Israel and its occupied territories with a single state that would give Jews and Palestinians equal rights. Anti-Zionists have argued that a binational state would still realize Jewish self-determination, as self-determination need not imply a separate state. Some supporters of Zionism highlight that some antisemites hold anti-Zionist views. The relationship between Zionism, anti-Zionism and antisemitism is debated, with some academics and organizations that study antisemitism taking the view that anti-Zionism is inherently antisemitic or new antisemitism, while others reject any such linkage as unfounded and a form of weaponization of antisemitism in order to stifle criticism of Israel and its policies, including its occupation of the West Bank and blockade of the Gaza Strip.","content":"#Anti-Zionism before 1948\n##Early Jewish anti-Zionism\n##Early Arab anti-Zionism\n##Reactions to the Balfour Declaration\n##Anti-Zionism in the 1920s–1930s\n##The Biltmore programme and its anti-Zionism fall-out\n##Religious\n#Anti-Zionism after World War II and the creation of Israel\n##1947–1948\n##Soviet Union\n##Arab and Palestinian anti-Zionism\n##Perception of Zionism as racism\n###During the Cold War\n###After the Cold War\n##Islamic perspectives\n##Left-wing politics\n##Christian anti-Zionism\n###Protestants\n###Catholics\n##Haredi Judaism\n#Allegations of antisemitism\n##Jewish right to a state\n##Equating and correlating anti-Zionism with antisemitism\n##View that the two are not interlinked\n##Shifting positions on the Zionist\/Anti-Zionist spectrum\n##Far-right politics\n##Conspiracy theories\n#See also\n#Notes\n##Citations\n#Sources\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

The following final appearance came 48 years later, in 1978, when the team captained by Daniel Passarella defeated the Netherlands 3–1 in extra time, becoming world champions for the first time. Captained by Diego Maradona, Argentina won their second World Cup eight years later, in 1986, with a 3–2 final victory over West Germany.

They were backed by Russia, which provided them arms and funding, leading to the protracted War in Donbas. The Minsk Accords aimed to reach a solution to the war that would preserve Ukraine's territorial integrity, but resulted only in a ceasefire.\nOn 24 February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine, just a few days after its recognition of the DPR and LPR, citing Ukraine's non-implementation of the Minsk Accords, amongst other stated reasons. On 30 September 2022, Russia formally annexed the two regions, in addition to two others. As a result, the DPR and LPR dropped their independence claims, now considering themselves to be part of Russia. \nThe United Nations and most of the international community have consistently condemned the DPR and LPR's initial independence claims, as well as the subsequent annexation.

{"title":"J._K._Rowling","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/J._K._Rowling","summary":"Joanne Rowling (  ROH-ling; born 31 July 1965), known by her pen name J. K. Rowling, is a British author and philanthropist. She is the author of Harry Potter, a seven-volume fantasy novel series published from 1997 to 2007. The series has sold over 600 million copies, been translated into 84 languages, and spawned a global media franchise including films and video games. The Casual Vacancy (2012) was her first novel for adults. She writes Cormoran Strike, an ongoing crime fiction series, under the alias Robert Galbraith. \nBorn in Yate, Gloucestershire, Rowling was working as a researcher and bilingual secretary for Amnesty International in 1990 when she conceived the idea for the Harry Potter series. The seven-year period that followed saw the death of her mother, the birth of her first child, divorce from her first husband, and relative poverty until the first novel in the series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, was published in 1997. Six sequels followed, concluding with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (2007). By 2008, Forbes had named her the world's highest-paid author.\nThe novels follow a boy called Harry Potter as he attends Hogwarts (a school for wizards), and battles Lord Voldemort. Death and the divide between good and evil are the central themes of the series. Its influences include Bildungsroman (the coming-of-age genre), school stories, fairy tales, and Christian allegory. The series revived fantasy as a genre in the children's market, spawned a host of imitators, and inspired an active fandom. Critical reception has been more mixed. Many reviewers see Rowling's writing as conventional; some regard her portrayal of gender and social division as regressive. There were also religious debates over the Harry Potter series.\nRowling has won many accolades for her work. She has received an OBE and made a Companion of Honour for services to literature and philanthropy. Harry Potter brought her wealth and recognition, which she has used to advance philanthropic endeavours and political causes. She established the Volant Charitable Trust in 2000, and co-founded the charity Lumos in 2005. Rowling's philanthropy centres on medical causes and supporting at-risk women and children. In 2012, Forbes estimated that Rowling's charitable giving totaled US$160 million. She has also donated to Britain's Labour Party, and opposed Scottish independence and Brexit. Since 2017, Rowling has been vocal about her opinions on transgender people and related civil rights. Her comments, described as transphobic by critics and LGBT rights organisations, have divided feminists, fuelled debates on freedom of speech and cancel culture, and prompted declarations of support for transgender people from the culture sector.","content":"#Name\n#Life and career\n##Early life and family\n##Secondary school and university\n##Inspiration and mother's death\n##Marriage, divorce and single parenthood\n##Publishing Harry Potter\n##Films\n##Religion, wealth and remarriage\n##Adult fiction and Robert Galbraith\n##Later Harry Potter works\n##Children's stories\n#Influences\n#Style and themes\n##Style and allusions\n##Themes\n#Reception\n##Gender and social division\n##Religious reactions\n#Legacy\n#Legal disputes\n#Philanthropy\n#Views\n##Politics\n##Press\n##Transgender people\n#Awards and honours\n#Bibliography\n#Filmography\n##Film\n##Television\n#Notes\n#References\n#Works cited\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

Widely regarded as one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time, Calaway spent the vast majority of his career wrestling for WWE and in 2022 was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame.\nCalaway began his career in 1987, working under various gimmicks for World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW) and other affiliate promotions. He signed with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in 1989 for a brief stint, and then joined the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) in 1990.\nCalaway rebranded himself as \"The Undertaker\" when he joined the WWF. As one of WWE's most high-profile and enduring characters, The Undertaker is famed for his undead, funereal, macabre \"Deadman\" persona, which gained significant mainstream popularity and won him the Wrestling Observer Newsletter award for Best Gimmick a record-setting 5 years in a row. He is the longest-tenured wrestler in company history at 30 years. In 2000, the Undertaker adopted a biker identity nicknamed \"American Badass\". Calaway resurrected the Deadman gimmick in 2004, with residual elements of the \"American Badass\" remaining.\nFor the better part of his career, the Undertaker was observed as a focal point of WWE's flagship annual event, WrestleMania, where he became esteemed for The Streak — a series of 21 straight victories, and headlined the event five times (13, 24, 26, 33 and 36). He is also known for pairing with his in-storyline half-brother Kane, with whom he alternatively feuded and teamed (as the Brothers of Destruction) from 1997 through 2020. During his wrestling career under the Undertaker gimmick, Calaway won the WWF\/E Championship four times, the World Heavyweight Championship three times, the Hardcore Championship once and the World Tag Team Championship six times.

Trump is a criminal case against Donald Trump, the 45th president of the United States. Trump was charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to conceal payments made to the pornographic film actress Stormy Daniels to ensure her silence about a sexual encounter between them; with costs related to the transaction included, the payments totaled $420,000. The Manhattan District Attorney (DA), Alvin Bragg, accused Trump of falsifying these business records with the intent to commit other crimes: violation of federal campaign finance limits, unlawfully influencing the 2016 U.S. presidential election, and tax fraud.\nThe indictment, the first of a former U.S. president, was approved by a Manhattan grand jury on March 30, 2023. On April 3, Trump traveled from his residence in Florida to New York City, where he surrendered to the Manhattan DA's office and was arraigned the next day. Trump pleaded not guilty and stated that he would continue to campaign for the 2024 presidential election, even if convicted. The trial began on April 15, 2024. On April 30, Trump also became the first U.S. president to be held in criminal contempt of court, due to comments he made earlier in the month about individuals involved with the trial.\nThe prosecution argued that Trump's 2016 campaign sought to benefit from the payment of hush money to Daniels through Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen, who was reimbursed via a false retainer agreement. The prosecution rested on May 20, 2024, after calling 20 witnesses. The defense argued that Trump was unaware of any allegedly unlawful scheme, that Cohen was unreliable as a witness, and that the retainer agreement between them was valid. The defense rested on May 21 after calling two witnesses. Throughout proceedings, the defense also made unsuccessful requests for the case to be delayed or dismissed, for the judge to recuse himself, and for a mistrial.\nTrump was convicted on all counts on May 30, 2024, becoming the first U.S. president to be convicted of a felony. Sentencing is scheduled for November 26. Trump has said that he will appeal the ruling.","content":"#Background\n##Stormy Daniels–Donald Trump scandal\n##Manhattan DA investigation and grand jury\n##Eligibility for president\n#Initial proceedings\n##Indictment and charges\n##Arraignment\n#Pre-trial proceedings\n##Request for indictment dismissal\n##Discovery materials and witnesses\n##Requests for recusal\n##Request for removal to federal court\n##Trial scheduling\n##Gag order\n##Statute of limitations\n#Overview of witnesses\n#Trial\n##Jury selection and opening statements\n##Contempt hearings\n##Prosecution witnesses\n###David Pecker\n###Graff, Farro, Browning, and Thompson\n###Keith Davidson and Douglas Daus\n###Hope Hicks\n###McConney, Tarasoff, and Franklin\n###Stormy Daniels\n###Manochio, Menzies, and Westerhout\n###Dixon, Tomalin, Longstreet, and Jarmel-Schneider\n###Michael Cohen\n##Defense witnesses\n###Daniel Sitko\n###Robert Costello\n##Closing arguments and jury instructions\n##Jury deliberations and verdict\n#Post-trial proceedings\n##Gag order\n##Delayed sentencing hearing\n##Immunity ruling\n##Firearms and liquor licenses\n##Potential appeal of conviction\n#Reactions\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

It was founded in May 2014 as the Azov Battalion (Ukrainian: батальйон «Азов», romanized: Batalion \"Azov\"), a self-funded volunteer militia under the command of Andriy Biletsky, to fight Russian-backed forces in the Donbas War. It was formally incorporated into the National Guard on 11 November 2014, and redesignated Special Operations Detachment \"Azov\", also known as the Azov Regiment. In February 2023, the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs announced that Azov was to be expanded as a brigade of the new Offensive Guard.\nThe unit has drawn controversy over its early and allegedly continuing association with far-right groups and neo-Nazi ideology, its use of controversial symbols linked to Nazism, and early allegations that members of the unit participated in human rights violations.  Some experts have been critical of the regiment's role within the larger Azov Movement, a political umbrella group made up of veterans and organizations linked to Azov, and its possible far-right political ambitions, despite claims of the regiment's depoliticization. Others argue that the regiment has changed, tempering its far-right underpinnings as it became part of the National Guard. The Azov Regiment has been a recurring theme of Russian propaganda.\nThe regiment's size was estimated to be around 2,500 combatants in 2017, and around 900 in 2022. Most of the unit's members are Russian speakers from Russian-speaking regions of Ukraine. It also includes members from other countries. The regiment gained renewed attention during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Russian president Vladimir Putin alleged that Ukraine was controlled by far-right forces, such as Azov, and gave \"denazification\" as a reason for the invasion. The Azov regiment played a prominent role in the siege of Mariupol and made its final stand at the Azovstal steel plant. The siege ended when a significant number of the regiment's fighters, including its commander, Denys Prokopenko, surrendered to Russian forces on orders from the Ukrainian high command. The unit has been designated a terrorist group by Russia since August 2022, after which Russia began sentencing Azov POWs in sham trials to punish them for defending Ukraine.","content":"#History\n##Background and founding, February–April 2014\n##Special Tasks Patrol Police, May 2014\n##Reorganisation and incorporation into the National Guard of Ukraine, November 2014\n##Battle of Shyrokyne, January 2015\n##2016–2019\n##Russian invasion of Ukraine\n###Defense of Mariupol\n###Other 'Azov' units\n#Leadership and organisation\n##Commanders\n##Status\n##Foreign fighters\n#Azov movement\n##Azov Civil Corps\n##National Corps\n##Youth Corps\n##National Militia, 2017–2020\n##Centuria\n#Human rights violations\n#Neo-Nazism allegations\n##Connection to antisemitism\n#International arms and training controversies\n##United States\n##Canada\n##Israel\n##Greece\n#Use in Russian propaganda and information campaigns\n##Pre-2022\n##Russian invasion\n#Sham trials in Russia\n#See also\n#References\n#Notes\n#Further reading\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

It stars Adah Sharma, Yogita Bihani, Sonia Balani, and Siddhi Idnani. The plot follows a group of women from Kerala who are coerced into converting to Islam and joining the Islamic State. Marketed as a true story, the film is premised on the Hindutva conspiracy theory of \"love jihad\", and claims that thousands of Hindu women from Kerala have been converted to Islam and recruited in the Islamic State.\nHowever, the filmmakers had to accept the addition of two disclaimers — that the figures in the film were inauthentic, and that the film was a \"fictionalised\" depiction of their minds.\nThe Kerala Story released in theatres on 5 May 2023. With a worldwide gross of ₹303.97 crore (US$36 million), it became the ninth-highest-grossing Hindi film of 2023. It was heavily promoted by the incumbent Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which leveraged the film in its campaigning for the Karnataka assembly election.  However, film critics accorded it overwhelmingly negative reviews, characterising the work as Islamophobic propaganda. The film has also faced protracted litigation and protests, primarily in Kerala, West Bengal and Tamil Nadu.","content":"#Plot\n#Cast\n#Production and release\n#Premise and factual accuracy\n#Response and Controversy\n##Promotion by ruling party\n##Political opposition\n##Public protests\n##Bans and litigation\n#Reception\n##Critical reception\n##Box office\n#Music\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

Of the tropical storms, ten became typhoons, and three would intensify into super typhoons. The season saw near-average activity by named storm count, although many of the storms were weak and short-lived, particularly towards the end of the season. This low activity was caused by an unusually strong La Niña that had persisted from 2020. The season's first named storm, Malakas, developed on April 6, while the last named storm, Pakhar, dissipated on December 12. The season's first typhoon, Malakas, reached typhoon status on April 12. The season ran throughout 2022, though most tropical cyclones typically develop between May and October.

Within the northwestern Pacific Ocean, there are two separate agencies that assign names to tropical cyclones which can often result in a cyclone having two names. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) named tropical cyclones that were judged to have 10-minute sustained wind speeds of at least 65 km\/h (40 mph) anywhere in the basin, whilst the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) assigned names to tropical cyclones which moved into or formed as a tropical depression in the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) located between 135°E and 115°E and between 5°N and 25°N regardless of whether or not a tropical cyclone has already been given a name by the JMA. Tropical depressions that were monitored by the United States' Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) were given a number with a \"W\" suffix.","content":"#Seasonal forecasts\n#Seasonal summary\n##Early season activity\n##Peak season activity\n##Late season activity\n#Systems\n##Tropical Depression 01W\n##Typhoon Malakas (Basyang)\n##Tropical Storm Megi (Agaton)\n##Typhoon Chaba (Caloy)\n##Tropical Storm Aere (Domeng)\n##Tropical Storm Songda\n##Tropical Storm Trases (Ester)\n##Tropical Depression 08W\n##Tropical Storm Mulan\n##Tropical Storm Meari\n##Severe Tropical Storm Ma-on (Florita)\n##Typhoon Tokage\n##Typhoon Hinnamnor (Henry)\n##Tropical Depression 13W (Gardo)\n##Typhoon Muifa (Inday)\n##Typhoon Merbok\n##Typhoon Nanmadol (Josie)\n##Tropical Storm Talas\n##Typhoon Noru (Karding)\n##Severe Tropical Storm Kulap\n##Typhoon Roke (Luis)\n##Tropical Depression Maymay\n##Tropical Depression 21W\n##Tropical Storm Sonca\n##Typhoon Nesat (Neneng)\n##Tropical Storm Haitang\n##Tropical Depression 25W (Obet)\n##Severe Tropical Storm Nalgae (Paeng)\n##Tropical Storm Banyan (Queenie)\n##Tropical Storm Yamaneko\n##Tropical Storm Pakhar (Rosal)\n##Other systems\n#Storm names\n##International names\n###Retirement\n##Philippines\n###Retirement\n#Season effects\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}
{"title":"Rishi_Sunak","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rishi_Sunak","summary":"Rishi Sunak (born 12 May 1980) is a British politician who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 2022 to 2024. He has been Leader of the Conservative Party since October 2022; after the general election in July 2024, he became Leader of the Opposition. The first British Asian to hold those offices, he previously held two Cabinet positions under Boris Johnson, latterly as Chancellor of the Exchequer from 2020 to 2022. Sunak has been Member of Parliament (MP) for Richmond and Northallerton, previously Richmond (Yorks), since 2015. He is the most recent Conservative Party prime minister.\nSunak was born in Southampton to parents of Indian descent who immigrated to Britain from East Africa in the 1960s. He was educated at Winchester College, studied philosophy, politics and economics at Lincoln College, Oxford, and earned a Master of Business Administration from Stanford University in California as a Fulbright Scholar. During his time at Oxford University, Sunak undertook an internship at Conservative Central Office, and joined the Conservatives. After graduating, Sunak worked for Goldman Sachs and later as a partner at the hedge fund firms the Children's Investment Fund Management and Theleme Partners. Sunak was elected to the House of Commons at the 2015 general election. As a backbencher, Sunak supported the successful campaign for Brexit in the 2016 European Union membership referendum. Sunak was appointed to the junior ministerial position of Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Local Government by Theresa May in 2019, and was appointed to the cabinet-attending role of Chief Secretary to the Treasury by Johnson in 2019.\nIn 2020, Sunak was promoted to Chancellor of the Exchequer. During his time in the position, Sunak was prominent in the government's financial response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic impact, including the furlough and Eat Out to Help Out schemes, and was also prominent in the government's response to the cost-of living crisis. As chancellor, Sunak received high approval and popularity ratings in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, although his popularity later declined amid the cost-of living crisis in 2022. He resigned as chancellor in July 2022 amid a government crisis that culminated in Johnson's resignation, and stood in the leadership election to succeed him. He received the most votes in each of the series of MP votes, but lost the members' vote to Liz Truss. After spending the duration of Truss's premiership on the backbenches, Sunak was elected unopposed in the leadership election to succeed Truss, who resigned amid another government crisis; aged 42 at the time he became prime minister, Sunak became the youngest prime minister since The Earl of Liverpool in 1812.\nDuring his premiership, Sunak attempted to improve the economy and stabilise national politics. He outlined five key priorities: halving inflation, growing the economy, cutting debt, reducing National Health Service waiting lists, and stopping the illegal small-boat crossings of the English Channel by enacting the Rwanda asylum plan. On foreign policy, Sunak authorised foreign aid and weapons shipments to Ukraine in response to the Russian invasion of the country, and pledged support for Israel after the attacks which began the Israel–Hamas war whilst later calling for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip. He did not avert further unpopularity for the Conservatives, reflected in the party's poor performances in the 2023 and 2024 local elections. Sunak called a general election for July 2024 despite being widely expected to call the election in the autumn; the Conservatives lost this election in a landslide to the opposition Labour Party led by Keir Starmer, ending 14 years of Conservative government. \nAfter leaving office, Sunak became Leader of the Opposition and has remained Conservative leader while the leadership election to replace him is taking place, and formed a shadow cabinet. He also intends to remain as a backbench MP for the next five years.","content":"#Early life and education (1980–2001)\n#Career\n##Business career (2001–2015)\n##Backbencher (2015–2018)\n##Local government under-secretary (2018–2019)\n##Chief secretary to the Treasury (2019–2020)\n##Chancellor of the Exchequer (2020–2022)\n###COVID-19 pandemic\n###Furlough scheme\n###Eat Out to Help Out\n###Cost of living crisis and energy crisis\n###Budgets\n###Other actions\n###Resignation\n##Conservative leadership bids\n#Premiership (2022–2024)\n##Cabinet\n###Reshuffles\n##Foreign policy\n###Immigration\n###Russia and Ukraine\n###Israel and Palestine\n##Local election results\n##2024 general election and resignation\n#Post-premiership (2024–present)\n##Leader of the Opposition (2024–present)\n#Political positions\n#Public image\n#Personal life\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}
{"title":"James_Webb_Space_Telescope","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/James_Webb_Space_Telescope","summary":"The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a space telescope designed to conduct infrared astronomy. As the largest telescope in space, it is equipped with high-resolution and high-sensitivity instruments, allowing it to view objects too old, distant, or faint for the Hubble Space Telescope. This enables investigations across many fields of astronomy and cosmology, such as observation of the first stars and the formation of the first galaxies, and detailed atmospheric characterization of potentially habitable exoplanets.\nAlthough the Webb's mirror diameter is 2.7 times larger than that of the Hubble Space Telescope, it produces images of comparable sharpness because it observes in the longer-wavelength infrared spectrum. The longer the wavelength of the spectrum, the larger the information-gathering surface required (mirrors in the infrared spectrum or antenna area in the millimeter and radio ranges) for an image comparable in clarity to the visible spectrum of the Hubble Space Telescope.\nThe Webb was launched on 25 December 2021 on an Ariane 5 rocket from Kourou, French Guiana. In January 2022 it arrived at its destination, a solar orbit near the Sun–Earth L2 Lagrange point, about 1.5 million kilometers (930,000 mi) from Earth. The telescope's first image was released to the public on 11 July 2022.\nThe U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) led Webb's design and development and partnered with two main agencies: the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). The NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland managed telescope development, while the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore on the Homewood Campus of Johns Hopkins University operates Webb. The primary contractor for the project was Northrop Grumman.\nThe telescope is named after James E. Webb, who was the administrator of NASA from 1961 to 1968 during the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo programs.\nWebb's primary mirror consists of 18 hexagonal mirror segments made of gold-plated beryllium, which together create a 6.5-meter-diameter (21 ft) mirror, compared with Hubble's 2.4 m (7 ft 10 in). This gives Webb a light-collecting area of about 25 m2 (270 sq ft), about six times that of Hubble. Unlike Hubble, which observes in the near ultraviolet and visible (0.1 to 0.8 μm), and near infrared (0.8–2.5 μm) spectra, Webb observes a lower frequency range, from long-wavelength visible light (red) through mid-infrared (0.6–28.3 μm). The telescope must be kept extremely cold, below 50 K (−223 °C; −370 °F), so that the infrared light emitted by the telescope itself does not interfere with the collected light. Its five-layer sunshield protects it from warming by the Sun, Earth, and Moon.\nInitial designs for the telescope, then named the Next Generation Space Telescope, began in 1996. Two concept studies were commissioned in 1999, for a potential launch in 2007 and a US$1 billion budget. The program was plagued with enormous cost overruns and delays. A major redesign was accomplished in 2005, with construction completed in 2016, followed by years of exhaustive testing, at a total cost of US$10 billion.","content":"#Features\n##Location and orbit\n##Sunshield protection\n##Optics\n##Scientific instruments\n##Spacecraft bus\n##Servicing\n##Software\n#Comparison with other telescopes\n#Development history\n##Background (development to 2003)\n##Early development and replanning (2003–2007)\n##Detailed design and construction (2007–2021)\n##Cost and schedule issues\n##Partnership\n##Naming concerns\n#Mission goals\n##Orbit design\n##Infrared astronomy\n#Ground support and operations\n##Micrometeoroid strike\n#From launch through commissioning\n##Launch\n##Transit and structural deployment\n##Commissioning and testing\n#Allocation of observation time\n##Early Release Science program\n##General Observer Program\n#Scientific results\n##First full-color images\n##Bright early galaxies\n##Subsequent noteworthy observations and interpretations\n##Gallery\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}
{"title":"Andrew_Tate","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Andrew_Tate","summary":"Emory Andrew Tate III (born 1 December 1986) is an American and British social media personality, businessman, and former professional kickboxer. He gained notoriety for promoting various positions in the manosphere community. His controversial commentary has resulted in his expulsion from various social media platforms and concern that he promotes misogynist views to his audience. A divisive influencer, Tate has amassed 9.9 million followers on X as of August 2024 and was the third-most googled person in 2023, with most British adults aware of who he is. He has been dubbed the \"king of toxic masculinity\", has called himself a misogynist and is politically described as both right-wing and far-right. As of August 2024, Tate is facing five legal investigations—three criminal and two civil—in Romania and the United Kingdom.\nTate first began to kickbox in 2005, winning several kickboxing titles in the late 2000s and early 2010s. In 2016, he appeared on the British reality series Big Brother, but was removed, as he was the suspect in an open rape investigation in the United Kingdom. The investigation was later dropped, but Tate was subject to an extradition request for rape charges in 2024. After his kickboxing career, Tate and his brother, Tristan, began operating a webcam model business, then sold online courses. With his audience from his courses, he became prominent as an internet celebrity promoting a hyper-macho view of masculinity. Tate's courses include Hustler's University, which gained 100,000 subscribers and was later rebranded as The Real World, and the secretive War Room group, which the BBC has accused of coercing women into sex work and teaching violence against women. In August 2023, it was estimated that Tate's online ventures generated US$5 million in revenue monthly.\nIn December 2022, Tate and his brother Tristan were arrested in Romania, along with two women. In June 2023, all four were charged with rape, human trafficking, and forming an organised crime group to sexually exploit women. In July, two of their accusers reportedly went into hiding after a campaign of online harassment, and the Tate brothers filed a defamation lawsuit, claiming $5 million in damages against one of the accusers. In March 2024, British police obtained an arrest warrant for the Tate brothers as part of an investigation into rape and human trafficking. In July 2024, they began a civil case against the brothers and a third person for alleged tax evasion. In August, Romanian police raided four properties Tate owns and expanded its investigation to include trafficking minors, sex with a minor, money laundering and attempting to influence witnesses. Tate and his brother have denied all charges and allegations.","content":"#Early life\n#Kickboxing career\n#Big Brother\n#Online ventures\n##The Real World (formerly Hustler's University)\n##War Room\n#Views and influence\n##Reception\n###Response\n###Surveys\n##Social media\n###Deplatforming\n#Personal life\n#Criminal investigations and civil cases\n##In Britain\n###2015–2019\n###2024–present\n##In Romania: 2022–present\n###Arrests, investigations and asset seizures\n###Rape and human trafficking charges\n###Pre-trial detention and restrictions\n###Online harassment and lawsuits\n#Kickboxing record\n#Mixed martial arts record\n##Professional record\n##Amateur record\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

Set in the 1820s, the film stars Viola Davis as a general who trains the next generation of warriors to fight their enemies. It is directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood and written by Dana Stevens, based on a story she wrote with Maria Bello. The film also stars Thuso Mbedu, Lashana Lynch, Sheila Atim, Hero Fiennes Tiffin, and John Boyega.\nBello conceived the idea for The Woman King in 2015 after visiting Benin, where the kingdom used to be located, and learning the history of the Agojie. She recruited Cathy Schulman to develop it into a feature film, pitching it to several studios, who turned it down due to financial concerns. After they met with TriStar Pictures in 2017, the film was greenlit in 2020. Production began in South Africa in November 2021, shut down due to the COVID-19 Omicron variant a few weeks later, and resumed in early 2022. Polly Morgan was the cinematographer. During post-production, the musical score was composed by Terence Blanchard, and the editing was completed by Terilyn A. Shropshire.\nThe Woman King had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 9, 2022, and Sony Pictures Releasing released the film in theaters in the United States on September 16, 2022. Following the festival screening, the film received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise directed towards Davis's performance and the action choreography. However, it underperformed at the box office, especially outside of America, and received criticism for historical distortion of slavery. At the 28th Critics' Choice Awards the film received nominations for Best Costume Design, Best Acting Ensemble, Best Director, and Best Actress for Davis. Furthermore, Davis also earned Best Actress nominations at the Golden Globes, Screen Actors Guild, BAFTA Film Awards, and NAACP Image Awards.\nIt was the last film to be distributed by Entertainment One in Canada before the distributor's Canadian division was shut down on June 29, 2022, along with its Spanish distribution shortly before its release.","content":"#Plot\n#Cast\n#Production\n##Development\n##Filming\n##Post-production\n#Release\n#Reception\n##Box office\n##Critical response\n##Accolades\n#Historical accuracy\n##Characters\n##Role in slavery\n#Controversy\n#Notes\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

These sets typically consist of 24 pieces, one for each of the major and minor keys (sets that comprise all the enharmonic variants include 30 pieces).\nExamples include Johann Sebastian Bach's The Well-Tempered Clavier and Frédéric Chopin's 24 Preludes, Op. 28. Such sets are often organized as preludes and fugues or designated as preludes or études. Some composers have restricted their sets to cover only the 12 major keys or the 12 minor keys; or only the flat keys (Franz Liszt's Transcendental Études) or the sharp keys (Sergei Lyapunov's Op. 11 set). In yet another type, a single piece may progressively modulate through a set of tonalities, as occurs in Ludwig van Beethoven's Two Preludes through all twelve major keys, Op. 39.\nThe bulk of works of this type have been written for piano solo, but there also exist sets for piano 4-hands; two pianos; organ; guitar; two guitars; flute; recorder; oboe; violin solo; violin and piano; cello solo; cello and piano; voice and piano; and string quartet.

With a total of eight Olympic medals, six gold and two bronze, he is the only short track speed skater in Olympic history to win gold in every distance, and the first to win a medal in every distance at a single Games. He has the most Olympic gold medals in the sport, three of which he won in the 2006 Winter Olympics and the other three in the 2014 Winter Olympics. Considered to be the greatest short track speed skater of all time, he is a six-time overall World champion (2003–2007, 2014), two-time overall World Cup winner (2003–04, 2005–06), and the 2014 European champion. He holds the most overall titles at the World Short Track Speed Skating Championships, and is the only male short track skater to win five consecutive world titles.\nIn 2008, Ahn suffered a knee injury and could not regain his health by the time the national qualifiers for Vancouver 2010 came around. His recovery being slow and his South Korean local team dissolved in 2010, Ahn, aiming for his second Olympics, became a Russian citizen the next year and began racing for the Russian team. After winning gold in Sochi, Ahn explained his reasons for joining the Russian team saying, \"I wanted to train in the best possible environment and I proved my decision was not wrong.\" As expected, a gold-winning athlete leaving the national team caused public uproar in South Korea. However, it was aimed not at Ahn, but at the country's skating union. Most South Korean fans in a poll said they understood his decision. Ahn continued his skating career in his adopted nation until 2019 and declared his retirement in April 2020.\nIn 2023, Ahn returned to Korea as a short track leader. Ahn returned to South Korea and applied to be a coach for Seongnam City's short track speed skating team, despite having renounced his South Korean citizenship when becoming Russian. However, since his change in 2014 he had been increasingly criticized for his work in Russia amid the Russo-Ukrainian War and his coaching position in the Chinese team at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. Some Korean coaches have formed The Korea Skating Coaches' Union and urged \"Seongnam City to appoint a coach that meets the public eye level\" and criticized Ahn that he \"lied during the naturalization process and betrayed his country\". and He was criticized by the public for betraying his country by transferring Korean sports skills to Russia and China. Ahn was eventually denied the coaching position due to significant public opposition.\nAfter being denied his position as Seongnam City Hall coach due to strong public opposition, Ahn explained the controversy he knew about his loss of nationality in advance and receives a full Olympic medal pension prior to Russian naturalization. he said: \"I donated every pension I had received prior to naturalization\". According to his explanation and a Korean ice skating official mentioned in Chosun Ilbo shortly thereafter, the entire lump sum pension he received was spent on rehabilitating \"children who needed heart surgery and Korean junior players\".

It was Świątek's first Miami Open title, her third consecutive WTA 1000 title, and her fourth WTA 1000-level title overall. Świątek became the first woman in history to win the first three WTA 1000 titles of the year in succession, the first player since Serena Williams in 2013 to win three consecutive WTA 1000 titles, and extended her winning streak to 17 matches. She lost no sets and just 26 games en route to the title, the fewest since Martina Hingis dropped 21 games in 2000; she was the first player to win the title in Miami without dropping a set since Azarenka in 2016. Additionally, Świątek won Miami exactly 10 years after fellow Polish tennis player Agnieszka Radwańska (who retired in 2018) won the tournament in 2012. \nRanked as the world No. 77, Osaka was the lowest-ranked Miami Open finalist in history, surpassing Clijsters' 2005 achievement as the then-world No. 38.\nAshleigh Barty was the two-time reigning champion, but withdrew from the tournament citing health issues. She later announced her retirement from professional tennis.\nŚwiątek and Paula Badosa were in contention for the WTA No. 1 singles ranking at the start of the tournament after Barty requested to be removed from the WTA rankings following her retirement. Świątek became the new world No. 1 after winning her second round match, making her the 28th player and the first Pole to hold the top singles position since the computer rankings began in 1975. Świątek also became the first player born in the 21st century (male or female) to hold a world No. 1 singles ranking.\nLike at Indian Wells, the international governing bodies of tennis (WTA, ATP, ITF, Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, US Open) allowed players from Russia and Belarus to continue to participate in tennis events on tour and at the majors, but not under the name or flag of Russia or Belarus until further notice, due to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.","content":"#Seeds\n#Draw\n##Key\n##Finals\n##Top half\n###Section 1\n###Section 2\n###Section 3\n###Section 4\n##Bottom half\n###Section 5\n###Section 6\n###Section 7\n###Section 8\n#Seeded players\n##Withdrawn players\n#Other entry information\n##Wildcards\n##Protected ranking\n##Qualifiers\n##Lucky losers\n##Withdrawals\n#Qualifying\n##Seeds\n##Qualifiers\n##Lucky losers\n##Qualifying draw\n###First qualifier\n###Second qualifier\n###Third qualifier\n###Fourth qualifier\n###Fifth qualifier\n###Sixth qualifier\n###Seventh qualifier\n###Eighth qualifier\n###Ninth qualifier\n###Tenth qualifier\n###Eleventh qualifier\n###Twelfth qualifier\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}
{"title":"L._Ron_Hubbard","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/L._Ron_Hubbard","summary":"Lafayette Ronald Hubbard (March 13, 1911 – January 24, 1986) was an American author and the founder of Scientology. A prolific writer of pulp science fiction and fantasy novels in his early career, in 1950 he authored Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health and established organizations to promote and practice Dianetics techniques. Hubbard created Scientology in 1952 after losing the intellectual rights to his literature on Dianetics in bankruptcy. He would lead the Church of Scientology, variously described as a cult, a new religious movement, or a business, until his death in 1986.\nBorn in Tilden, Nebraska, in 1911, Hubbard spent much of his childhood in Helena, Montana. While his father was posted to the U.S. naval base on Guam in the late 1920s, Hubbard traveled to Asia and the South Pacific. In 1930, Hubbard enrolled at George Washington University to study civil engineering but dropped out in his second year. He began his career as an author of pulp fiction and married Margaret Grubb, who shared his interest in aviation.\nHubbard was an officer in the Navy during World War II, where he briefly commanded two ships but was removed from command both times. The last few months of his active service were spent in a hospital, being treated for a variety of complaints. In 1953, the first churches of Scientology were founded by Hubbard. In 1954 a Scientology church in Los Angeles was founded, which became the Church of Scientology International. Hubbard added organizational management strategies, principles of pedagogy, a theory of communication and prevention strategies for healthy living to the teachings of Scientology. As Scientology came under increasing media attention and legal pressure in a number of countries during the late 1960s and early 1970s, Hubbard spent much of his time at sea as \"commodore\" of the Sea Organization, a private, quasi-paramilitary Scientologist fleet.\nHubbard returned to the United States in 1975 and went into seclusion in the California desert after an unsuccessful attempt to take over the town of Clearwater, Florida. In 1978, Hubbard was convicted of fraud after he was tried in absentia by France. In the same year, 11 high-ranking members of Scientology were indicted on 28 charges for their role in the Church's Snow White Program, a systematic program of espionage against the United States government. One of the indicted was Hubbard's wife Mary Sue Hubbard; he himself was named an unindicted co-conspirator. Hubbard spent the remaining years of his life in seclusion, attended to by a small group of Scientology officials.\nFollowing his 1986 death, Scientology leaders announced that Hubbard's body had become an impediment to his work and that he had decided to \"drop his body\" to continue his research on another plane of existence. The Church of Scientology describes Hubbard in hagiographic terms, though many of his autobiographical statements were fictitious. Sociologist Stephen Kent has observed that Hubbard \"likely presented a personality disorder known as malignant narcissism.\"","content":"#Life\n##Before Dianetics\n###Pre-war fiction\n###Military career\n###After the war\n##In the Dianetics era\n##Pivot to Scientology\n##In the Church of Scientology era\n##In the Sea Org era\n##In hiding\n#Sources and doctrines\n#False biographical claims\n#Legacy\n##In Scientology\n##In popular culture\n#Select works\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Works cited\n#Further reading\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

The election was to elect 56 members of the 15th Johor State Legislative Assembly. The previous assembly was dissolved on 22 January 2022.\nThe state election was conducted in the midst of the 2020-22 Malaysian political crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia. The state election is notable for being the first elections to have UNDI18 voters, where 18-year-olds were allowed to vote.\nThe snap election was called prematurely after the government led by Menteri Besar Hasni Mohammad had lost a simple majority in the legislature, being left with a minority government of just 28 seats, above one seat against the 27 seats of the opposition following the death of Kempas assemblyman and former Menteri Besar Osman Sapian on 21 December 2021 before the dissolution. The Sultan of Johor, Sultan Ibrahim Ismail consented to the dissolution of the Johor State Legislative Assembly on 22 January 2022.\nThe state election is the fourth election after the 2018 general election, resulting in the most non-simultaneous elections between federal and state elections in a single 5-year term of parliament in the nation's history. The state election is also the third election after Ismail Sabri Yaakob took over as Prime Minister in August 2021. The state election would also be the first in which 18-20 year olds are eligible to vote after the gazettement of the constitutional amendment on 15 December 2021.\nBarisan Nasional (BN) continued its landslide winning streak in recent state elections, winning 40 seats and a two-thirds majority. Pakatan Harapan (PH) suffered heavy losses, winning only 12 seats. Perikatan Nasional (PN) won just 3 seats.

{"title":"2023_Israeli_judicial_reform","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2023_Israeli_judicial_reform","summary":"The 2023 Israeli judicial reform is a set of five changes to the judicial system and the balance of powers in Israel that was proposed in January 2023. The intent of the measures is to curb the judiciary's influence over lawmaking and public policy by limiting the Supreme Court's power to exercise judicial review, granting the government control over judicial appointments and limiting the authority of its legal advisors. The effort was led by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Justice Yariv Levin and the Chair of the Knesset's Constitution, Law and Justice Committee, Simcha Rothman.\nThe Supreme Court has, for several decades, assumed the right to declare Knesset legislation unconstitutional. The reform would permit the Knesset to override such a ruling by reintroducing the legislation and approving it with a majority of Knesset members. The reform would additionally diminish the ability of courts to conduct judicial review of the Basic Laws and change the makeup of the Judicial Selection Committee, so that control over the appointment of judges is effectively given to the government.\nLevin and the ruling government coalition have stated that the above is the first step in their judicial reform, and that additional steps are planned, including:\n\nchanging the appointment process of legal advisors to government ministries, such that they are appointed and dismissed by the ministers;\nmaking the legal advisers' legal advice a recommendation, rather than binding on the ministers; and\nmaking them subordinate directly to the ministers, rather than to the Justice Ministry's professional oversight.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu maintains that the reform is necessary because the judiciary has too much control over public policy, and a better balance is needed between democratically elected legislators and the judiciary. However, Netanyahu has been barred from actively taking part in the process of the judicial reform by the Attorney General, due to a conflict of interest stemming from his ongoing corruption trial.\nThe coalition is also advancing a number of other bills concerning Israel's judicial system and the balance of powers, including:\n\nreforms to widen the authority of the Rabbinical Court, allowing them to act as arbitrators in civil matters using religious law, if both parties consent;\nbills limiting the ability to call for a no-confidence vote and other methods for dissolving a sitting Knesset;\nbills prohibiting criminal proceedings against sitting Prime Ministers (which could free the current PM, Netanyahu, from the  corruption charges currently pending against him); and\nbills permitting key public service positions to be positions of trust, appointed by politicians, rather than professional aappointments.\nThe proposed reform has sparked significant backlash, as well as some support, both inside and outside of Israel. Opposition leaders and activists accused the government of undermining established norms of checks and balances and attempting to seize absolute power, with some arguing the reform amounts to an attempt at regime change. The Israeli president, Isaac Herzog, has called for the reforms to be halted to allow for a wider consultative process, and the president of the Supreme Court and the Attorney General have attested to the reform's illegalities. Protests against the reform escalated in Israel shortly after its introduction, as did significant concern among some in the international community.\nOn 27 March 2023, after public protests and general strikes, Netanyahu announced a pause in the reform process to allow for dialogue with opposition parties. However, negotiations aimed at reaching a compromise collapsed in June, and the government resumed its plans to unilaterally pass parts of the legislation. On 24 July 2023, the Knesset passed a bill that curbs the power of the Supreme Court to declare government decisions unreasonable; on 1 January 2024, the Supreme Court struck the bill down.","content":"#Background\n##Israeli Supreme Court and judicial review\n##1992 Constitutional Revolution and its discontents\n##2018–2022 Israeli political crisis and 2022 legislative election\n#Legislative history\n##HCJ 5658\/23 Movement for Quality Government in Israel v.

{"title":"Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy","summary":"On November 22, 1963, John F. Kennedy, the 35th president of the United States, was assassinated while riding in a presidential motorcade through Dealey Plaza in Dallas, Texas. Kennedy was in the vehicle with his wife Jacqueline, Texas Governor John Connally, and Connally's wife Nellie, when he was fatally shot from the nearby Texas School Book Depository by Lee Harvey Oswald, a former U.S. Marine. The motorcade rushed to Parkland Memorial Hospital, where Kennedy was pronounced dead about 30 minutes after the shooting; Connally was also wounded in the attack but recovered. Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson was hastily sworn in as president two hours and eight minutes later aboard Air Force One at Dallas Love Field.\nAfter the assassination, Oswald returned home to retrieve a pistol; he shot and killed lone Dallas policeman J. D. Tippit shortly afterwards. Around 70 minutes after Kennedy and Connally were shot, Oswald was apprehended by the Dallas Police Department and charged under Texas state law with the murders of Kennedy and Tippit. Two days later, at 11:21 a.m. on November 24, 1963, as live television cameras covered Oswald's being moved through the basement of Dallas Police Headquarters, he was fatally shot by Dallas nightclub operator Jack Ruby. Like Kennedy, Oswald was taken to Parkland Memorial Hospital, where he soon died. Ruby was convicted of Oswald's murder, though the decision was overturned on appeal, and Ruby died in prison in 1967 while awaiting a new trial.\nAfter a 10-month investigation, the Warren Commission concluded that Oswald assassinated Kennedy, and that there was no evidence that either Oswald or Ruby was part of a conspiracy. In 1967, New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison brought the only trial for Kennedy's murder, against businessman Clay Shaw; Shaw was acquitted. Subsequent federal investigations—such as the Rockefeller Commission and Church Committee—agreed with the Warren Commission's general findings. In its 1979 report, the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) concluded that Kennedy was likely \"assassinated as a result of a conspiracy\". The HSCA did not identify possible conspirators, but concluded that there was \"a high probability that two gunmen fired at [the] President\". The HSCA's conclusions were largely based on a police Dictabelt recording later debunked by the U.S. Justice Department.\nKennedy's assassination is still the subject of widespread debate and has spawned many conspiracy theories and alternative scenarios; polls found that a vast majority of Americans believed there was a conspiracy. The assassination left a profound impact and was the first of four major assassinations during the 1960s in the United States, coming two years before the assassination of Malcolm X in 1965, and five years before the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Kennedy's brother Robert in 1968. Kennedy was the fourth U.S. president to be assassinated and is the most recent to have died in office.","content":"#Background\n##Kennedy\n##Oswald\n#November 22\n##Kennedy's arrival in Dallas and route to Dealey Plaza\n##Shooting\n##Aftermath in Dealey Plaza\n##Oswald's flight, killing of J.

{"title":"2022_UK_Championship","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2022_UK_Championship","summary":"The 2022 UK Championship (officially the 2022 Cazoo UK Championship) was a professional snooker tournament that took place from 12 to 20 November 2022 at the York Barbican in York, England. The fifth ranking event and first Triple Crown event of the 2022–23 snooker season, the tournament was the 46th edition of the UK Championship, which was first held in 1977. Organised by the World Snooker Tour and sponsored by car retail company Cazoo, the event was broadcast domestically by the BBC and Eurosport. The winner received £250,000 from a total prize fund of £1,205,000.\nThe tournament organisers changed the format for the 2022 event, replacing the flat-128 draw that had been used from 2013 to 2021 with a format that closely resembled that of the World Snooker Championship. The top 16 players in the world rankings were seeded through to the last-32 stage, where they were joined by 16 qualifiers from a 128-player qualifying tournament that took place from 5 to 10 November at Ponds Forge in Sheffield. Aged 60, Jimmy White became the oldest player to qualify for the tournament's final stages since 63-year-old Eddie Charlton in 1993.\nThe defending champion was Zhao Xintong, who defeated Luca Brecel 10–5 in the final of the 2021 event. Zhao lost 2–6 in the first round to Sam Craigie. Mark Allen reached his third UK Championship final, having been runner-up in 2011 and 2018, where he faced three-time winner Ding Junhui, who reached his first ranking final in three years. Allen trailed in every match he played in the tournament, and fell 1–6 behind in the final, but he won nine of the last ten frames to clinch a 10–7 victory. He became the second Northern Irish player to win the UK Championship, after Alex Higgins in 1983; his comeback from 1–6 behind saw him overcome the largest deficit in a UK Championship final since Higgins came from 0–7 behind to defeat Steve Davis 16–15 in that year. It was Allen's eighth ranking title and second Triple Crown title, following his win at the 2018 Masters. Cao Yupeng made the tournament's highest break of 144 in his second-round qualifying match against Callum Beresford.","content":"#Format\n##Prize fund\n#Summary\n##Qualifying rounds\n##First round\n##Second round\n##Quarter-finals\n##Semi-finals\n##Final\n#Main draw\n##Final\n#Qualifying draw\n#Century breaks\n##Main stage centuries\n##Qualifying stage centuries\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

This marked the first time in the state's history where it lost a seat.\nThis was the second election using congressional districts drawn by the California Citizens Redistricting Commission (after 2012 following the 2010 census). The commission submitted the final maps to the California Secretary of State on December 27, 2021. These new districts are considered \"enacted\" as of December 27, 2021. However, there was a 90-day period that ended on March 27, 2022, for any referendum petition to be filed to prevent the maps from becoming effective. Even after becoming effective, these newly redrawn districts did not become official until the 2022 primary and general elections, and the new districts will not actually exist until the 2023 inaugurations.\nOf the fifty-three incumbents, six retired. All remaining incumbents were re-elected, and five new representatives were elected, two of which were from newly drawn districts.","content":"#Overview\n##Statewide\n##District\n#District

{"title":"John_Green","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/John_Green","summary":"John Michael Green (born August 24, 1977) is an American author, YouTuber, podcaster, and philanthropist. His books have more than 50 million copies in print worldwide, including The Fault in Our Stars (2012), which is one of the best-selling books of all time. Green's rapid rise to fame and idiosyncratic voice are credited with creating a major shift in the young adult fiction market. Green is also well known for his work in online video, most notably his YouTube ventures with his brother Hank Green.\nBorn in Indianapolis, Indiana, Green was raised in Orlando, Florida, before attending boarding school outside of Birmingham, Alabama. He attended Kenyon College, graduating with a double major in English and religious studies in 2000. Green then spent six months as a student chaplain at a children's hospital. He reconsidered his path and began working at Booklist in Chicago while writing his first novel. His debut novel Looking for Alaska (2005) was awarded the 2006 Michael L. Printz Award. While living in New York City, Green published his second novel, An Abundance of Katherines (2006). Starting on January 1, 2007, John and his brother Hank launched the Vlogbrothers YouTube channel, a series of vlogs submitted to one another on alternating weekdays; the videos spawned an active online-based community called Nerdfighteria and an annual telethon-style fundraiser called Project for Awesome, both of which have persisted and grown over time.\nJohn moved back to Indianapolis in 2007, and published three novels over the next three years: Let It Snow: Three Holiday Romances (2008, with Maureen Johnson and Lauren Myracle); his third solo novel, Paper Towns (2008); and Will Grayson, Will Grayson (2010, with David Levithan). From 2010 to 2013, John and Hank launched several online video projects, including VidCon, an annual conference for the online video community, and Crash Course (2011–present), a wide-ranging educational channel. Green's 2012 novel, The Fault in Our Stars, and the 2014 film adaptation were massive commercial and critical successes, leading to several other film and television adaptations of his work. He was included in Time magazine's 2014 list of the 100 most influential people in the world.\nGreen's subsequent projects, his novel Turtles All the Way Down (2017) and The Anthropocene Reviewed (2018–2021), dealt more directly with his anxiety and obsessive–compulsive disorder. The Anthropocene Reviewed began as a podcast in January 2018, with Green reviewing different facets of the Anthropocene on a five-star scale. The podcast was then adapted into The Anthropocene Reviewed: Essays on a Human-Centered Planet (2021), his first nonfiction book. Since the mid-2010s, John Green has been a prominent advocate for global health causes: he is a trustee for Partners In Health (PIH), supporting their goal of reducing maternal mortality in Sierra Leone, and has worked with PIH and a number of organizations in fighting tuberculosis worldwide. Green's second nonfiction book, Everything Is Tuberculosis: The History and Persistence of Our Deadliest Infection, is set to be released in March 2025.","content":"#Early life and education\n#Career\n##Early career and novels (2001–2006)\n###Booklist magazine and Looking for Alaska\n###An Abundance of Katherines\n##Online and literary collaborations (2007–2011)\n###Paper Towns and collaborative works\n###Online video beginnings\n##Breakout success (2012–2016)\n###The Fault in Our Stars and adaptations\n###Focus on educational content\n###Appearances\n##Established author and internet personality (2017–2022)\n###Turtles All the Way Down\n###The Anthropocene Reviewed\n###Further adaptations\n###Partners In Health\n###Complexly and DFTBA\n###Appearances and other projects\n##Focus on global health (2022–present)\n###Anti-tuberculosis advocacy\n###Other efforts\n#Influence and reception\n##Books\n###Book banning\n##Online ventures\n#Personal life and interests\n#Works\n##Books\n##Short stories\n##Other\n##Filmography\n#Awards\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}
{"title":"Mahsa_Amini_protests","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mahsa_Amini_protests","summary":"Civil unrest and protests against the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran associated with the death in police custody of Mahsa Amini (Persian: مهسا امینی) began on 16 September 2022 and carried on into 2023, but were said to have \"dwindled\" or \"died down\" by spring of 2023. As of September 2023, the \"ruling elite\" of Iran was said to remain \"deeply entrenched\" in power. The protests were described as \"unlike any the country had seen before\", the \"biggest challenge\" to the government, and \"most widespread revolt\", since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.\nMahsa Amini was arrested by the Guidance Patrol on 13 September 2022 for allegedly violating Iran's mandatory hijab law by wearing her hijab \"improperly\" while visiting Tehran from Saqqez. According to eyewitnesses, she was severely beaten by Guidance Patrol officers (this was denied by Iranian authorities). She subsequently collapsed, was hospitalized and died three days later. As the protests spread from Amini's hometown of Saqqez to other cities in the Iranian Kurdistan and throughout Iran, the government responded with widespread Internet blackouts, nationwide restrictions on social media usage, tear gas and gunfire.\nAlthough the protests have not been as deadly as those in 2019 (when more than 1,500 were killed), they have been \"nationwide, spread across social classes, universities, the streets [and] schools\". At least 551 people, including 68 minors, had been killed as a result of the government's intervention in the protests, as of 15 September 2023. Before February 2023 when most were pardoned, an estimated 19,262 were arrested across at least 134 cities and towns and 132 universities.\nFemale protesters, including schoolchildren, have played a key role in the demonstrations. In addition to demands for increased rights for women, the protests have demanded the overthrow of the Islamic Republic, setting them apart from previous major protest movements in Iran, which have focused on election results or economic woes. \nThe government's response to the protests and its \"brutal and disproportionate use of force against peaceful protesters and children\" was widely condemned, but Supreme Leader of Iran Ayatollah Ali Khamenei dismissed the unrest as \"riots\" and part of a \"hybrid war\" against Iran created by foreign enemy states and dissidents abroad.\nOn March 6, 2024, the UN accused Iran of coordinating crimes against humanity, which the government rejected.","content":"#Background\n##Condition of women and the Islamic Republic\n##Protest movements under the Islamic Republic\n##Mahsa Amini's arrest and death in custody\n#Protests\n##Slogans and greviances\n##Iranian public opinion\n##Protest techniques\n##Civil boycotts\n##Media Western coverage\n#Casualties, government response\n##Casualties\n###Government casualties\n##Arrests and death sentences\n###Executions\n##Suspected food poisoning\n###University students\n###Schoolgirls\n##Statements by officials\n##Government strategy and tactics\n##Communications blackouts\n##Response by regime supporters\n##Government campaign for public opinion\n#Aftermath\n##Lack of head covering\n###Crackdown\n###Surveillance of protesters and dissidents\n#Analysis\n#International reactions\n##International organizations\n##Diplomatic ties\n##Human rights advocates\n##Sanctions\n#In popular culture\n##Music\n##Sports\n###2022 FIFA World Cup\n###Commercialism\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

It stars Tom Holland as Nathan Drake and Mark Wahlberg as Victor Sullivan, with Sophia Ali, Tati Gabrielle (in her feature film debut), and Antonio Banderas in supporting roles. In the film, Drake is recruited by Sullivan in a race against corrupt billionaire Santiago Moncada (Banderas) and mercenary leader Jo Braddock (Gabrielle) to locate the fabled treasure of the Magellan expedition.\nThe film entered development in 2008 with producer Avi Arad stating that he would be working with Sony Pictures to develop a film adaptation of the video game franchise. It was then in development hell with various directors, screenwriters, and lead cast members attached at various points. Filmmakers David O. Russell, Neil Burger, Seth Gordon, Dan Trachtenberg, Shawn Levy, and Travis Knight were initially signed to direct while Wahlberg was set to play Drake in early development. Holland was cast as Drake in May 2017 and Fleischer was hired as the director in early 2020. Filming began in March 2020, but was halted by the COVID-19 pandemic. It resumed in July and finished in October, with locations including Boston, Barcelona, New York City, and Kiamba.\nOriginally set to be released on December 18, 2020, the film faced major delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It eventually premiered at the Coliseum in Barcelona on February 7, 2022, and was theatrically released in the United States by SIE's sister companies Sony Pictures Releasing and PlayStation Productions on February 18. Though the film received mixed reviews from critics, it was a box office success, grossing over $407.1 million worldwide on a $120 million budget, making it the fifth-highest-grossing video game film of all time. A sequel is in development.","content":"#Plot\n#Cast\n#Production\n##Development\n##Pre-production\n##Filming\n#Music\n#Release\n##Theatrical\n###Bans in the Philippines and Vietnam\n##Home media\n##Marketing\n#Reception\n##Box office\n##Critical response\n#Sequel\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}
{"title":"Women's_cinema","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Women's_cinema","summary":"Women's cinema primarily describes cinematic works directed (and optionally produced too) by women filmmakers. The works themselves do not have to be stories specifically about women, and the target audience can be varied.\nIt is also a variety of topics bundled together to create the work of women in film. This can include women filling behind-the-scenes roles such as director, cinematographer, writer, and producer while also addressing the stories of women and character development through screenplays (on the other hand, films made by men about women are instead called Woman's film).\nRenowned female directors include Alice Guy-Blaché, film pioneer and one of the first film directors, Agnès Varda, the first French New Wave director, Margot Benacerraf 1959, the first woman to win the Cannes International Critics Prize and be nominated for the Palme D'Or,Yulia Solntseva, the first woman to win the Best Director Award at Cannes Film Festival (1961), Lina Wertmüller, the first woman nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director (1977), Barbra Streisand, the first woman to win the Golden Globe Award for Best Director (1983), Jane Campion, the first woman to win the Palme D'Or at Cannes Film Festival (1993), and Kathryn Bigelow, the first woman to win the Academy Award for Best Director (2009), along with many other female directors from around the world such as Dorothy Arzner, Ida Lupino, Lois Weber, Leni Riefenstahl, Mary Harron, Sofia Coppola, Kira Muratova, Claire Denis, Chantal Akerman, Catherine Breillat, Lucrecia Martel, Lynne Ramsay, Céline Sciamma, Claudia Weill, and Julie Dash. Many successful cinematographers are also women, including Margarita Pilikhina, Maryse Alberti, Reed Morano, Rachel Morrison, Halyna Hutchins,, and Zoe White.\nWomen's cinema recognizes women's contributions all over the world, not only to narrative films but to documentaries as well.

{"title":"2022_Brazilian_general_election","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2022_Brazilian_general_election","summary":"General elections were held in Brazil on 2 October 2022 to elect the president, vice president, the National Congress, the governors, vice governors, and legislative assemblies of all federative units, and the district council of Fernando de Noronha. As no candidate for president—or for governor in some states—received more than half of the valid votes in the first round, a runoff election for these offices was held on 30 October. Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva received the majority of the votes in the second round and became president-elect of Brazil.\nFar-right incumbent president Jair Bolsonaro was seeking a second term. He had been elected in 2018 as the candidate of the Social Liberal Party but left that party in 2019, followed by the resignation or dismissal of many of his ministers during his term. After a failed attempt to create the Alliance for Brazil, he joined the Liberal Party in 2021. For the 2022 election, he selected Walter Braga Netto of the same party as his vice presidential candidate rather than the incumbent vice president Hamilton Mourão.\nFormer president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, of the left-wing Workers' Party, was a candidate for a third non-consecutive term after previously having been elected in 2002 and re-elected in 2006. His successor from the same party, former president Dilma Rousseff, was elected in 2010 and re-elected in 2014, but was impeached and removed from office in 2016 due to accusations of administrative misconduct. Lula's intended candidacy in 2018 was disallowed due to his conviction on corruption charges in 2017 and subsequent arrest; a series of court rulings led to his release from prison in 2019, followed by the annulment of his conviction and restoration of his political rights by 2021. For his vice presidential candidate in the 2022 election, Lula selected Geraldo Alckmin, who had been a presidential candidate of the Brazilian Social Democracy Party in 2006 (facing Lula in the second round) and 2018 but changed his affiliation to the Brazilian Socialist Party in 2022.\nLula received the most votes in the first round, with 48.43% to Bolsonaro's 43.20%, which made him the first presidential candidate to obtain more votes than the incumbent president in Brazil. While Lula came close to winning in the first round, the difference between the two leading candidates was closer than opinion polls had suggested, and right-wing parties made gains in the National Congress. Nevertheless, Lula's vote share was the second-best performance for the Workers' Party in the first round of a presidential election, behind only his own record of 48.61% in 2006. In the second round, Lula received 50.90% of the votes to Bolsonaro's 49.10%, the closest presidential election result in Brazil to date. Lula became the first person to secure a third presidential term, receiving the highest number of votes in a Brazilian election. At the same time, Bolsonaro became the first incumbent president to lose a bid for a second term since a 1997 constitutional amendment allowing consecutive re-election.\nIn response to Lula's advantage in pre-election polls, Bolsonaro had made several pre-emptive allegations of electoral fraud. Many observers denounced these allegations as false and expressed concerns that they could be used to challenge the outcome of the election. On 1 November, during his first public remarks after the election, Bolsonaro refused to elaborate on the result, although he did authorise his chief of staff, Ciro Nogueira Lima Filho, to begin the transition process with representatives of president-elect Lula on 3 November. On 22 November, Bolsonaro and his party requested that the Superior Electoral Court invalidate the votes recorded by electronic voting machines that lacked identification numbers, which would have resulted in him being elected with 51% of the remaining votes. On the next day the court rejected the request and fined the party R$22.9 million (US$4.3 million) for what it considered bad faith litigation. Lula was sworn in on 1 January 2023; a week later, pro-Bolsonaro protestors stormed the offices of the National Congress, the Presidential Palace, and the Supreme Federal Court, unsuccessfully attempting to overthrow the newly-elected government. The elected members of the National Congress were sworn in on 1 February.","content":"#Background\n#Electoral system\n##Voters\n##Candidates and political parties\n##Procedure\n#Presidential candidates\n##Candidates in runoff\n##Candidates not advanced to runoff\n##Withdrawn or declined to be candidates\n##Coalitions\n#Congress\n#Campaign\n##Debates\n#Incidents\n##Political violence\n###Notable cases\n####June–August\n####September–October\n##Disinformation\n##Electoral fraud allegations\n###Reactions to potential coup\n####International reactions\n##Voter suppression attempts\n###In the first round\n####Intimidation of voters\n###In the second round\n##Environmental issues\n##Views and endorsements\n#Opinion polls\n##Presidential election\n###First round\n###Second round\n#Results\n##President\n###By federative unit\n##Chamber of Deputies\n##Federal Senate\n#Aftermath\n##Analysis\n###Presidential election results\n###Congressional election results\n##Reactions\n###In Brazil\n###Abroad\n##Transition of power\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Collapse_of_Silicon_Valley_Bank","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Collapse_of_Silicon_Valley_Bank","summary":"On March 10, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) failed after a bank run, marking the third-largest bank failure in United States history and the largest since the 2007–2008 financial crisis. It was one of three bank failures, along with Silvergate Bank and Signature Bank, in March 2023 in the United States.\nSeeking higher investment returns from its burgeoning deposits, SVB had dramatically increased its holdings of long-term securities since 2021, accounting for them on a hold-to-maturity basis. The market value of these bonds decreased significantly through 2022 and into 2023 as the Federal Reserve raised interest rates to curb an inflation surge, causing unrealized losses on the portfolio. Higher interest rates also raised borrowing costs throughout the economy and some Silicon Valley Bank clients started pulling money out to meet their liquidity needs. To raise cash to pay withdrawals by its depositors, SVB announced on Wednesday, March 8 that it had sold over US$21 billion worth of securities, borrowed $15 billion, and would hold an emergency sale of some of its treasury stock to raise $2.25 billion. The announcement, coupled with warnings from prominent Silicon Valley investors, caused a bank run as customers withdrew funds totaling $42 billion by the following day.\nOn the morning of March 10, the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation seized SVB and placed it under the receivership of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). An additional $100 billion were expected to be withdrawn during Friday. About 89 percent of the bank's $172 billion in deposit liabilities exceeded the maximum insured by the FDIC. Two days after the failure, the FDIC received exceptional authority from the Treasury and announced jointly with other agencies that all depositors would have full access to their funds the next morning. Seeking to auction off all or parts of the bank, the FDIC reopened it on Monday March 13 as a newly organized bridge bank, Silicon Valley Bridge Bank, N.A. Although some characterized the government response as a bailout, the plan did not entail rescuing the bank, its management or shareholders, but rather making uninsured depositors whole from the proceeds of selling the bank's assets, without the use of taxpayer money. \nThe collapse of SVB had significant consequences for startup companies in the U.S. and abroad, with many briefly unable to withdraw money from the bank. Other large technology companies, media companies, and wineries were also affected. For a number of founders and their venture capital backers, this was the bank of choice.","content":"#Background\n#Collapse\n##Losses\n##Instability\n##Receivership\n##Acquisition\n#Effects\n##Customers\n##Shareholders\n##Financial system\n##Legal actions\n#Reactions\n##Official responses\n##Debate over government intervention\n##Debate about causes\n#See also\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"A._L._Zissu","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/A._L._Zissu","summary":"Abraham Leib Zissu (first name also Avram, middle name also Leiba or Leibu; Hebrew: אברהם לייב זיסו; January 25, 1888 – September 6, 1956) was a Romanian writer, political essayist, industrialist, and spokesman of the Jewish Romanian community. Of modest social origin and a recipient of Hasidic education, he became a cultural activist, polemicist, and newspaper founder, remembered primarily for his Mântuirea daily. During the 1910s, he involved himself in the effort to unify and reactivate the local Zionist movement. By the end of World War I, Zissu also emerged as a theorist of Religious Zionism, preferring communitarianism and self-segregation to the assimilationist option, while also promoting literary modernism in his activity as novelist, dramatist, and cultural sponsor. He was the inspiration behind the Jewish Party, which competed with the mainstream Union of Romanian Jews (UER) for the Jewish vote. Zissu and UER leader Wilhelm Filderman had a lifelong disputation over religious and practical politics, which gave way to a mutual dislike punctuated by episodes of fraternization.\nAlways a confrontational critic of antisemitism, Zissu found himself marginalized by fascist regimes in the late 1930s and for most of World War II. During the Holocaust, he risked his personal freedom to defend the interests of his community, and was especially vocal as a critic of the collaborationist Central Jewish Office. He eventually reached a compromise with the Ion Antonescu regime when the latter curbed its deportations of Jews to Transnistria, and, after 1943, helped initiate the Aliyah Bet exodus of Romanian and Hungarian Jews to Mandatory Palestine. Such efforts required that he contact and build a working relationship with high-ranking officials of the regime, including Mihai Antonescu, Radu Lecca, and Pamfil Șeicaru. Though backed by the Rescue Committee of the Jewish Agency and the World Jewish Congress, his contribution is at the center of an enduring controversy, focusing on his alleged favoritism of Zionist Jews and his cantankerousness. He had a reluctant collaboration with the more junior Zionist Mișu Benvenisti, who emerged as one of his key rivals.\nIn 1942, while held at Târgu Jiu internment camp, Zissu was co-opted by the Romanian resistance cells, and formed a political bond with Antonescu rival Nicolae Rădescu. Assisting M. H. Maxy of the Romanian Communist Party, he established links with the more mainstream National Peasants' Party. He and Maxy also formed a Jewish Democratic Front, holding seats on its Central Committee alongside Leon Ghelerter. From 1944, they helped finance the underground movement against Antonescu. As part of such organizational efforts, Zissu personally handled the accommodation of Jewish parachutists, including Shaike Dan Trachtenberg. He also persuaded the increasingly defeatist Romanian regime not to tolerate pogroms on its territory. Shortly after the Coup of August 1944, which restored democracy, Zissu's Zionism merged with explicit anti-communism, clashing directly with the Communist Party's anti-cosmopolitan agenda; he also found himself opposed to the mainstream groups in Romania and Palestine, criticizing Labor Zionism and celebrating Zionist political violence when used against British authorities. \nThe creation of a monopolistic Jewish Democratic Committee, led by Maxy and favored by Benvenisti, resulted in Zissu's near-complete marginalization in political life; friends quarreled with him when he publicized his anticlericalism, which specifically targeted Chief Rabbi Alexandru Șafran. In that context, Zissu veered toward a non-communist \"Biblical socialism\", which he envisaged as the doctrine of a new political group in Israel. After 1948, his renewed effort to ensure the mass emigration of Romanian Jews, and his contacts with Israeli government officials, made him a target for the communist regime. In 1951, he was arrested and tortured into confessing that he had spied for Israel; in 1954, he was sentenced to life imprisonment for the crime of high treason. Zissu was amnestied after two years, having spent most of them in the notoriously harsh Pitești prison. Finally allowed to emigrate in July 1956, he died less than two months after in a Tel Aviv hospital. He left a corpus of works in various languages, including Hebrew, many of which survive as manuscripts.","content":"#Biography\n##Hasidic scholar and journalistic debut\n##Religious Zionism\n##Nazi persecution\n##Resistance movement\n##Jewish leadership\n##Against communism\n##Securitate set-up and imprisonment\n##Trial, reprieve, and death\n#Legacy\n#Notes\n","lang":"en"}
{"title":"Cultural_impact_of_Madonna","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cultural_impact_of_Madonna","summary":"Madonna (born 1958) is an American singer whose socio-cultural impact has been noted by popular press and scholars from different fields, throughout the late-twentieth and early twenty-one centuries, and attested outside of the music sphere to an international scale. \nNamed by Time magazine as one of the most powerful women of the 20th century, Madonna was included among remarkable American figures by publications and cultural institutions, including the Smithsonian Institution, National Geographic Society, Encyclopædia Britannica and Discovery Channel. Her impact has been compared to that of other entertainers such as Michael Jackson, the Beatles, Marilyn Monroe and Elvis Presley. Madonna has also been described by different publications as one of the most-well-written about figures in popular culture. In between immediate and retrospectives, euphemistic or straightforward discussions around Madonna further centered her as arguably the long-time foremost influential female musician from popular music.\nHer success led to other female singers being called to her namesake, and the way she was received by media, public, and academia was also credited to help the way future generations of female singers were scrutinized and succeed in a multi-metric environment, further breaking gender and multicultural barriers. Madonna's influence on other entertainers was also articulated. Her music impact as a whole led Billboard staffers to describe that \"the history of pop music can essentially be divided into two eras: pre-Madonna and post-Madonna\". In the process, she amassed various world records, especially for a female artist, being recognized as the best-selling music female artist by the Guinness World Records and other industry publications, also receiving various nicknames by the press, ranged from \"Madge\" to \"Queen of Pop\" and \"Queen of Music\" industry. She was also called a pop and cultural icon by academicians, including her critics. \nA complex figure, Madonna's evolving persona and work also attracted socio-cultural criticisms from a varied of perspectives and approaches, which made her someone difficult to categorize as noted by social critics like Stuart Sim. She became a polarizing and challenged figure, whom perpetuated an image of controversialist and provocateur, a reputation to which she acknowledges, although she responded is generally marked to provoke thoughts and conversations. As her career advanced, Madonna's credibility fluctuated. She has faced a substantial societal antireactions ranging from censorship to boycotts and death threats from organizations and radicalized groups, including the Islamic State (ISIS). The transcultural and globalized reach of Madonna from ambiguous and negative perspectives were further conceptualized within terms such as \"Madonna-economy\" or the \"Madonnanization\", drawing comparisons with that of the McDonaldization or Cocacolonization, while she was called a hyperglobalized example. Some criticisms towards Madonna also came from generalized criticisms of various aspects, including criticisms on popular culture. Despite correspondence between critics, it was also documented that some critical analyses considered the way Madonna polarized views, early marked prominently by the fact she was an \"unavoidable\" figure.","content":"#Background\n##Critical scope\n#Culture\n##Global\n##American culture\n##Popular culture\n###Other areas\n#Multiculturalism\n##Perceptions and impact\n##Representations\n#Contradictory perspectives\n##Scope and ambivalences\n##Generalized cultural and social criticisms\n##Racial and cultural appropriation\n##Globalized and Transcultural criticisms\n##Censorship and death threats\n#Image\n##Public persona\n##Reinvention\n##Appearance\n##Fitness\n##Personal and professional relationships\n##Age and cross-polarization\n###Timeline\n###Views of Madonna\n###Impact\n#Madonna and critics\n##Madonna's views\n##Views on criticisms and on Madonna's responses\n#Cultural depictions\n##Science and cultural tributes\n##Cultural critics' lists, reference works and polls\n##Superlatives in popular press\n##Sobriquetes on popular culture\n#Music industry\n##Markets, genres and popularizing of things\n##Female figure and paradigm shifts\n#Musicability\n##Ambivalences\n##Vocals\n##Songwriting\n##Production and involving process\n#Influence on other entertainers\n##Examples\n##Depictions and tributes by other musicians\n##Other fields\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Book sources\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"France_national_football_team","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/France_national_football_team","summary":"The France national football team (French: Équipe de France de football) represents France in men's international football. It is controlled by the French Football Federation (FFF; Fédération française de football), the governing body for football in France. It is a member of UEFA in Europe and FIFA in global competitions. The team's colours and imagery reference two national symbols: the French blue-white-red tricolour and Gallic rooster (coq gaulois). The team is colloquially known as Les Bleus (The Blues). They play home matches at the Stade de France in Saint-Denis and train at Centre National du Football in Clairefontaine-en-Yvelines.\nFounded in 1904, the team has won two FIFA World Cups, two UEFA European Championships, one CONMEBOL–UEFA Cup of Champions, two FIFA Confederations Cups and one UEFA Nations League title. France was one of the four European teams that participated in the first World Cup in 1930. Twenty-eight years later, the team led by Raymond Kopa and Just Fontaine finished in third place at the 1958 World Cup. France experienced much of its success in three different eras: in the 1980s, the late 1990s to early 2000s, and the late 2010s to early 2020s. In 1984, under the leadership of the three-time Ballon d'Or winner Michel Platini, France won Euro 1984 (its first official title), a CONMEBOL–UEFA Cup (1985), and reached two World Cup semi-finals (1982 and 1986).\nDuring the captaincy of Didier Deschamps, with Zinedine Zidane on the pitch, Les Bleus won the 1998 World Cup and Euro 2000. They also won the Confederations Cup in 2001 and 2003. Three years later, France made it to the final of the 2006 World Cup, losing 5–3 on penalties to Italy. A decade later, the team reached the final of Euro 2016, where they lost 1–0 to Portugal in extra time. Two years after that, France won the 2018 World Cup, its second title in that competition. After winning the 2021 Nations League, they became the first, and so far, the only European national team to have won every senior FIFA and UEFA competition. In 2022, France reached a second consecutive World Cup final, but lost 4–2 on penalties to Argentina. France is also one of only two countries, the other being Brazil, to have won all men's FIFA 11-player competitions at all age levels, having claimed both the FIFA World Cup, FIFA U-20 World Cup, FIFA U-17 World Cup, the now-defunct FIFA Confederations Cup, and Olympic title, as well as the first to complete the collection, after the U-20 national team captured the first U-20 World Cup title in 2013.\nFrance has footballing rivalries with Belgium, England, Germany, Italy, Portugal, and Spain. A bitter rivalry with Argentina also developed and intensified in the early 2020s.","content":"#History\n##Early years (1900–1930s)\n##1950s–1980s\n##Zidane era and World Champions (1996–2006)\n##Decline and rebuild (2007–2015)\n##Renewed success (2016–present)\n#Home stadium\n#Team image\n##Media coverage\n##Kits and crest\n###Kit sponsorship\n###Kit deals\n##Nickname\n#Results and fixtures\n##2023\n##2024\n#Coaching staff\n##Coaching history\n#Players\n##Current squad\n##Recent call-ups\n##Player of the Year\n#Player records\n##Most appearances\n##Top goalscorers\n#Competitive record\n##FIFA World Cup\n##UEFA European Championship\n##UEFA Nations League\n##FIFA Confederations Cup\n##CONMEBOL–UEFA Cup of Champions\n#Honours\n##Major competitions\n##Friendly\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}
{"title":"Great_Snowstorm_of_1944","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Great_Snowstorm_of_1944","summary":"The Great Snowstorm of 1944 was a disruptive winter storm that brought high winds and between 12 and 30 inches (30 and 76 centimetres) of snow to the eastern Great Lakes region of North America between Sunday, December 10, and Wednesday, December 13, 1944. The areas most affected included northeastern Ohio, western Pennsylvania, West Virginia, upstate New York, southern Ontario and southern Quebec.\nThe snowstorm was caused when two separate storms, one from the west, which had dropped moderate amounts of snow through the Central Great Plains and Midwest of the United States, and another from the southern Atlantic Coast, both moved towards Pennsylvania, causing high snowfall amounts and high winds in the adjacent states and provinces, before both moved easterly through New England and then into the Atlantic Ocean. Other effects of the twin-pronged storm, such as cold temperatures, high winds, light snow, sleet, freezing rain and rain, covered the remainder of the eastern United States and southern central Canada.\nIncluding the toll from the western storm, the death toll was between 87 and 100 people in the US and between 21 and 24 people in Canada, with an unknown total of serious injuries. The most heavily impacted major cities included: Toronto with 57.2 cm (22.5 in) of snow; Hamilton, Ontario, with 62.5 cm (24.6 in); Pittsburgh with 15.5 inches (39 cm); and Rochester with 22.3 inches (57 cm); while smaller cities with the greatest snowfalls included St. Catharines, Ontario, with 66 cm (26 in) and Erie, Pennsylvania, with 26.5 inches (67 cm).\nThe storm was crippling to these urban areas such that most car, truck, streetcar and bus transport was blocked for a full day and hindered for three to five days, while stores, government offices and factories were closed for one to two days, and schools were closed for two to three days or longer. In some rural areas nearby these cities, people were snowbound to varying degrees for up to five or six days. Intercity travel by road, bus or air was blocked for two to three days and train travel was blocked or subject to long delays for one to two days. The single highest snowfall was recorded in Elkins in Randolf County, West Virginia, which received 36 inches (91 cm), with other mountainous areas of that state receiving about 30 inches (76 cm).","content":"#Meteorological history\n#Overall impact\n#Fatalities and injuries\n#Impacts on most affected areas\n##Ohio\n##Pennsylvania\n###Erie\n###Pittsburgh\n##West Virginia\n##New York\n###Rochester\n##Ontario\n###Toronto\n###Hamilton and Niagara\n##Quebec\n#See also\n#References\n#Notes\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Blockade_of_Nagorno-Karabakh","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Blockade_of_Nagorno-Karabakh","summary":"The blockade of Nagorno-Karabakh was an event in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. The region was disputed between Azerbaijan and the breakaway Republic of Artsakh, internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan, which had an ethnic Armenian population and was supported by neighbouring Armenia, until the dissolution of Republic of Artsakh on 28 September 2023.\nOn 12 December 2022, under the guise of environmental protests, the Azerbaijani government launched a blockade of the Republic of Artsakh by sending citizens claiming to be eco-activists to block the Lachin corridor, a humanitarian corridor which connected Artsakh to Armenia and the outside world. Disguised military personnel, civil servants, members of pro-government NGOs, and youth organisations were among the so-called activists. The Azerbaijani government consolidated its blockade by seizing territory around the Lachin corridor both within Artsakh and Armenia, blocking alternative bypass routes, and installing military checkpoints. Azerbaijan also sabotaged critical civilian infrastructure of Artsakh, crippling access to gas, electricity, and internet access.\nThe blockade led to a humanitarian crisis for the population in Artsakh; imports of essential goods have been blocked, as well as humanitarian convoys of the Red Cross and the Russian peacekeepers, trapping the 120,000 residents of the region. Shortages of essential goods – including electricity, fuel, and water reserves – were widespread and emergency reserves were rationed, along mass unemployment, and closures of schools and public transportation.\nAzerbaijan claimed its actions were aimed at preventing the transportation of weapons and natural resources; Azerbaijan also said its goal was for Artsakh's \"integration\" into Azerbaijan, despite opposition from the population, and threatened military action.\nNumerous countries, international organizations, and human rights observers condemned the blockade and considered it to be a form of hybrid warfare, ethnic cleansing, and genocide. Multiple international observers also considered the blockade and the inaction of the Russian peacekeepers to be violations of the tripartite ceasefire agreement signed between Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Russia, which ended the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War and guaranteed safe passage through the Lachin corridor. Azerbaijan ignored calls from various countries and international organizations to restore freedom of movement through the corridor. The blockade ended on 30 September 2023, following an Azerbaijani military offensive and the subsequent exodus of Armenians from Nagorno-Karabakh.","content":"#Background\n##First blockade (1989–2023) and isolation from Armenia (1989–1992)\n##Threats to public utility infrastructure and entry\n##Prelude\n#Blockade timeline\n##2022 events\n##2023 events\n#Humanitarian crisis\n##Lack of access to supplies and medical care\n###Limited supplies transported by the Red Cross and the Russian peacekeepers\n##Damage to infrastructure\n#Genocide risk factors\n#Inaction of the Russian peacekeepers\n#Proposed solutions\n#Authenticity of the environmental activism claims\n##Involvement of the Azerbaijani government\n##Involvement of state employees and civil servants\n##Inaccessibility of Nagorno-Karabakh to the public and independent journalists\n##Scrutiny of the \"protesters\" and their alleged environmental concerns\n#Lawsuits\n##International Court of Justice\n##European Court of Human Rights\n#Reactions\n##Involved parties\n##International\n##Supranational\n##Non-governmental organizations\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n##Works cited\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Polar_bear","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Polar_bear","summary":"The polar bear (Ursus maritimus) is a large bear native to the Arctic and nearby areas. It is closely related to the brown bear, and the two species can interbreed. The polar bear is the largest extant species of bear and land carnivore, with adult males weighing 300–800 kg (660–1,760 lb). The species is sexually dimorphic, as adult females are much smaller. The polar bear is white- or yellowish-furred with black skin and a thick layer of fat. It is more slender than the brown bear, with a narrower skull, longer neck and lower shoulder hump. Its teeth are sharper and more adapted to cutting meat. The paws are large and allow the bear to walk on ice and paddle in the water.\nPolar bears are both terrestrial and pagophilic (ice-living) and are considered to be marine mammals because of their dependence on marine ecosystems. They prefer the annual sea ice but live on land when the ice melts in the summer. They are mostly carnivorous and specialized for preying on seals, particularly ringed seals. Such prey is typically taken by ambush; the bear may stalk its prey on the ice or in the water, but also will stay at a breathing hole or ice edge to wait for prey to swim by. The bear primarily feeds on the seal's energy-rich blubber. Other prey include walruses, beluga whales and some terrestrial animals. Polar bears are usually solitary but can be found in groups when on land. During the breeding season, male bears guard females and defend them from rivals. Mothers give birth to cubs in maternity dens during the winter. Young stay with their mother for up to two and a half years.\nThe polar bear is considered to be a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) with an estimated total population of 22,000 to 31,000 individuals. Its biggest threats are climate change, pollution and energy development. Climate change has caused a decline in sea ice, giving the polar bear less access to its favoured prey and increasing the risk of malnutrition and starvation. Less sea ice also means that the bears must spend more time on land, increasing conflicts with people. Polar bears have been hunted, both by native and non-native peoples, for their coats, meat and other items. They have been kept in captivity in zoos and circuses and are prevalent in art, folklore, religion and modern culture.","content":"#Naming\n#Taxonomy\n##Evolution\n#Characteristics\n#Distribution and habitat\n#Behaviour and ecology\n##Social life\n##Diet and hunting\n##Reproduction and development\n##Mortality\n#Conservation status\n#Relationship with humans\n##Exploitation\n##Conflicts\n##Captivity\n##Cultural significance\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

This was the first edition of the postseason since 2012 to have a new format, as it has been expanded to include six teams per league. The top two division winners of the American and National leagues receive first-round byes into the Division Series, and the worst-division winner is the third seed in their respective league. The three Wild Card teams are the fourth, fifth, and sixth seeds. The third seed hosts the sixth seed, and the fourth seed does the same with the fifth seed in the best-of-three Wild Card series. The postseason started on Friday, October 7, two days after the end of the regular season.\nThe Wild Card series winners advanced to face the two best division winners from each league in the best-of-five Division Series with no reseeding (i.e. the 1 seed will face the 4\/5 winner and the 2 seed will face the 3\/6 winner). The winners of the Division Series (LDS) will then move on to the best-of-seven League Championship Series (LCS) to determine the pennant winners that will face each other in the World Series.\nIn the American League, the Houston Astros were the first team to clinch a postseason spot, their seventh appearance in the last eight seasons. The New York Yankees also clinched their seventh postseason berth in the past eight years, while the now-Cleveland Guardians clinched their fifth postseason berth in the past seven seasons. The Toronto Blue Jays also returned, as they clinched their second postseason appearance in the past three years. The Tampa Bay Rays returned for the fourth year in a row, and the Seattle Mariners ended two decades of futility by clinching their first postseason berth since 2001, ending what was the longest active postseason drought in Major League Baseball and all of the four major North American sports leagues.\nIn the National League, the Los Angeles Dodgers became the first team to clinch a postseason spot in MLB overall, marking their tenth straight appearance; this became the longest active postseason appearance streak in the four major North American professional sports leagues after the Pittsburgh Penguins failed to qualify for the 2023 Stanley Cup playoffs. The Dodgers became the first team to make ten consecutive postseason appearances since the Yankees did so from 1998 to 2007. On September 19, the New York Mets clinched their third postseason berth in the past eight years and first overall since 2016, marking the first time since 2015 that both New York City teams appeared in the postseason. The defending World Series champion Atlanta Braves clinched their fifth straight postseason berth on September 20. The St. Louis Cardinals clinched the NL Central title on September 27, which was their first division title since 2019 and their fourth consecutive postseason appearance. The San Diego Padres clinched their second postseason berth in the past three years on October 2. On October 3, the Philadelphia Phillies clinched their first postseason berth since 2011, ending what was also the longest active postseason drought in the National League.\nThe Wild Card Series saw three of the lower seeds advanced to the next round, while the Division Series saw the top two seeds in the National League win only one game each.\nThe postseason ended on November 5, with the Astros defeating the Phillies in six games in the World Series. It was the Astros' second championship in franchise history, the first without a major cheating scandal, and the latest date for a World Series game on record.","content":"#Playoff seeds\n##American League\n##National League\n#Playoff bracket\n#American League Wild Card Series\n##(3) Cleveland Guardians vs. (6) Tampa Bay Rays\n##(4) Toronto Blue Jays vs. (5) Seattle Mariners\n#National League Wild Card Series\n##(3) St. Louis Cardinals vs. (6) Philadelphia Phillies\n##(4) New York Mets vs. (5) San Diego Padres\n#American League Division Series\n##(1) Houston Astros vs. (5) Seattle Mariners\n##(2) New York Yankees vs. (3) Cleveland Guardians\n#National League Division Series\n##(1) Los Angeles Dodgers vs. (5) San Diego Padres\n##(2) Atlanta Braves vs. (6) Philadelphia Phillies\n#American League Championship Series\n##(1) Houston Astros vs. (2) New York Yankees\n#National League Championship Series\n##(5) San Diego Padres vs. (6) Philadelphia Phillies\n#2022 World Series\n##(AL1) Houston Astros vs. (NL6) Philadelphia Phillies\n#Notes\n#Broadcasting\n##Television coverage\n###United States\n###Canada\n##Radio\n##Most watched playoff games\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Boethius","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Boethius","summary":"Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius, commonly known simply as Boethius (; Latin: Boetius; c. 480–524 AD), was a Roman senator, consul, magister officiorum, polymath, historian, and philosopher of the Early Middle Ages. He was a central figure in the translation of the Greek classics into Latin, a precursor to the Scholastic movement, and, along with Cassiodorus, one of the two leading Christian scholars of the 6th century. The local cult of Boethius in the Diocese of Pavia was sanctioned by the Sacred Congregation of Rites in 1883, confirming the diocese's custom of honouring him on the 23 October. \nBoethius was born in Rome a few years after the forced abdication of the last Western Roman emperor, Romulus Augustulus. A member of the Anicii family, he was orphaned following the family's sudden decline and was raised by Quintus Aurelius Memmius Symmachus, a later consul. After mastering both Latin and Greek in his youth, Boethius rose to prominence as a statesman during the Ostrogothic Kingdom, becoming a senator by age 25, a consul by age 33, and later chosen as a personal advisor to Theodoric the Great.\nIn seeking to reconcile the teachings of Plato and Aristotle with Christian theology, Boethius sought to translate the entirety of the Greek classics for Western scholars. He published numerous transcriptions and commentaries of the works of Nicomachus, Porphyry, and Cicero, among others, and wrote extensively on matters concerning music, mathematics, and theology. Though his translations were unfinished following an untimely death, it is largely due to them that the works of Aristotle survived into the Renaissance.\nDespite his successes as a senior official, Boethius became deeply unpopular among other members of the Ostrogothic court for denouncing the extensive corruption prevalent among other members of government. After publicly defending fellow consul Caecina Albinus from charges of conspiracy, he was imprisoned by Theodoric around the year 523. While jailed Boethius wrote On the Consolation of Philosophy, a philosophical treatise on fortune, death, and other issues which became one of the most influential and widely reproduced works of the Early Middle Ages. He was tortured and executed in 524, becoming a martyr in the Christian faith by tradition.","content":"#Early life\n#Rise to power\n#Downfall and death\n#Major works\n##De consolatione philosophiae\n##De topicis differentiis\n##De arithmetica\n##De institutione musica\n##Opuscula sacra\n#Dates of works\n#Legacy\n#Veneration\n#In popular culture\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n##Sources\n#Further reading\n#External links\n##Works\n##On Boethius' life and works\n##On Boethius' logic and philosophy\n","lang":"en"}

It is directed by Jude Anthany Joseph, who wrote the screenplay with Akhil P. Dharmajan and is produced by Venu Kunnappilly, C.K. Padmakumar, and Anto Joseph under the banner of Kavya Film Company in collaboration with P.K. Prime Production. The film stars Tovino Thomas, Kunchacko Boban, Asif Ali, Vineeth Sreenivasan, Narain and Lal with an ensemble cast. Set in a fictional village, the plot follows characters from all walks of life as they struggle to deal with the flood.  \nThe film was officially announced in September 2018 by Jude Anthany Joseph with the initial title 2403 Ft.: The Story Of Unexpected Heroes, and was later changed to the current title. The film went on the floors a year after the disaster in October 2019 and got shelved in its budding stages due to various reasons. However, Jude Anthony went on to revamp the project with a new set of actors and technicians. Although the production was paused in 2020 due to the pandemic, but was later resumed around May 2022. The filming was wrapped up on 13 November 2022. The film was shot at over 120 locations including Thrissur, Ernakulam, Kottayam, Alappuzha, Idukki, Kollam, and Tirunelveli. The music was done by William Francis and Nobin Paul (who also created the background score), with editing and cinematography handled by Chamman Chacko and Akhil George. \nInitially set to release on 21 April 2023, it eventually released on 5 May 2023. The film received generally positive reviews and became a huge commercial success in the box office, grossing around ₹176 crore (US$21 million) at the box office to emerge as the highest-grossing Malayalam film of all-time overtaking Pulimurugan (2016) until it was surpassed by Manjummel Boys in 2024. On 27 September 2023, the film was chosen by the Film Federation of India as India's official entry for Best International Feature Film at the 96th Academy Awards. It was chosen as it addresses a global issue and depicts the harrowing realities of what a natural calamity is for common people. It became the fourth Malayalam film after Guru (1997), Adaminte Makan Abu (2011) and Jallikattu (2019) to be selected as India's official submission for the Academy Awards, although it failed to make the cut. It was featured in the 54th IFFI Indian panorama mainstream section.","content":"#Plot\n#Cast\n#Production\n##Development\n##Casting\n##Filming\n#Release\n##Theatrical\n##Home media\n#Music\n#Reception\n##Box office\n##Critical response\n#Awards and honours\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

It is based on the GPT-3.5 large language model (LLM), and was later updated to use the GPT-4 architecture. ChatGPT can generate human-like conversational responses, and enables users to refine and steer a conversation towards a desired length, format, style, level of detail, and language. It is credited with accelerating the AI boom, which has led to ongoing rapid investment in and public attention to the field of artificial intelligence. Some observers have raised concern about the potential of ChatGPT and similar programs to displace human intelligence, enable plagiarism, or fuel misinformation.\nBy January 2023, ChatGPT had become what was then the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users in two months and contributing to the growth of OpenAI's current valuation of $86 billion. ChatGPT's release spurred the release of competing products, including Gemini, Claude, Llama, Ernie, and Grok. Microsoft launched Copilot, initially based on OpenAI's GPT-4. In June 2024, a partnership between Apple Inc. and OpenAI was announced, in which ChatGPT was integrated into the Apple Intelligence feature of Apple operating systems. As of July 2024, ChatGPT's website is among the 20 most-visited websites globally.\nChatGPT is built on OpenAI's proprietary series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models, and is fine-tuned for conversational applications using a combination of supervised learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback. Successive user prompts and replies are considered at each conversation stage as context. ChatGPT was released as a freely available research preview, but due to its popularity, OpenAI now operates the service on a freemium model. Users on its free tier can access GPT-4o.

{"title":"Ukraine","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ukraine","summary":"Ukraine is a country in Eastern Europe. It is the second-largest European country after Russia, which borders it to the east and northeast. It also borders Belarus to the north; Poland and Slovakia to the west; Hungary, Romania and Moldova to the southwest; with a coastline along the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov to the south and southeast. Kyiv is the nation's capital and largest city, followed by Kharkiv, Dnipro, and Odesa. Ukraine's official language is Ukrainian.\nDuring the Middle Ages, Ukraine was the site of early Slavic expansion and the area later became a key centre of East Slavic culture under the state of Kievan Rus', which emerged in the 9th century. The state eventually disintegrated into rival regional powers and was destroyed by the Mongol invasions of the 13th century. The area was then contested, divided, and ruled by a variety of external powers for the next 600 years, including the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, the Austrian Empire, the Ottoman Empire, and the Tsardom of Russia. The Cossack Hetmanate emerged in central Ukraine in the 17th century, but was partitioned between Russia and Poland, and absorbed by the Russian Empire. Ukrainian nationalism developed and, following the Russian Revolution in 1917, the short-lived Ukrainian People's Republic was formed. The Bolsheviks consolidated control over much of the former empire and established the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, which became a constituent republic of the Soviet Union when it was formed in 1922. In the early 1930s, millions of Ukrainians died in the Holodomor, a human-made famine. The German occupation during World War II in Ukraine was devastating, with 7 million Ukrainian civilians killed, including most Ukrainian Jews.\nUkraine gained independence in 1991 as the Soviet Union dissolved, and declared itself neutral. A new constitution was adopted in 1996. A series of mass demonstrations, known as the Euromaidan, led to the establishment of a new government in 2014 after a revolution. Russia then unilaterally annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula, and pro-Russian unrest culminated in a war in the Donbas between Russian-backed separatists and government forces in eastern Ukraine. Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Since the outbreak of war with Russia, Ukraine has continued to seek closer ties with the United States, European Union, and NATO.\nUkraine is a unitary state and its system of government is a semi-presidential republic. A developing country, it is the poorest country in Europe by nominal GDP per capita and corruption remains a significant issue. However, due to its extensive fertile land, pre-war Ukraine was one of the largest grain exporters in the world. Ukraine is considered a middle power in global affairs, and the Ukrainian Armed Force is the fifth largest armed force in the world in terms of both active personnel as well as total number of personnel with the eighth largest defence budget in the world. The Ukrainian Armed Forces also operates one of the largest and most diverse drone fleets in the world. It is a founding member of the United Nations, as well as a member of the Council of Europe, the World Trade Organization, and the OSCE. It is in the process of joining the European Union and has applied to join NATO.","content":"#Etymology and orthography\n#History\n##Early history\n##Golden Age of Kyiv\n##Foreign domination\n##Cossack Hetmanate\n##19th and early 20th century\n##Inter-war period\n##World War II\n##Post–war Soviet Ukraine\n##Independence\n#Geography\n##Climate\n##Biodiversity\n##Urban areas\n#Politics\n##Constitution\n##Government\n##Courts and law enforcement\n##Foreign relations\n##Military\n##Administrative divisions\n#Economy\n##Agriculture\n##Tourism\n##Transport\n##Energy\n##Information technology\n#Demographics\n##Language\n##Diaspora\n##Religion\n##Health\n##Education\n##Regional differences\n#Culture\n##Libraries\n##Literature\n##Architecture\n##Weaving and embroidery\n##Music\n##Media\n##Sport\n##Cuisine\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Print sources\n##Reference books\n##Recent (since 1991)\n##History\n###World War II\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}
{"title":"God_of_War_Ragnarök","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/God_of_War_Ragnarök","summary":"God of War Ragnarök is a 2022 action-adventure game developed by Santa Monica Studio and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment. It was released worldwide on November 9, 2022, for both the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5, marking the first cross-gen release in the God of War series, and was released for Windows on September 19, 2024. It is the ninth installment in the series, the ninth chronologically, and the sequel to 2018's God of War. Loosely based on Norse mythology, the game is set in ancient Scandinavia and features series protagonist, Kratos, and his now teenage son, Atreus. Concluding the Norse era of the series, the game's story follows Kratos and Atreus' efforts into preventing the nine realms of being destroyed by Ragnarök, the eschatological event which is central to Norse mythology and was foretold to happen in the previous game after Kratos killed the Aesir god Baldur.\nThe gameplay is similar to the previous 2018 installment. It features combo-based combat, as well as puzzle and role-playing elements. Improvements and additions include Kratos's main weapons: a magical battle axe and his double-chained blades, and a new magical spear; his shield has become more versatile, with different types of shields that have differing offensive and defensive abilities. His son Atreus, as well as some other characters, provide assistance in combat and can be passively controlled, though as a new feature in the series, he is fully controllable in specific story segments.\nOriginally slated for a 2021 release, the game was delayed in part due to Kratos actor Christopher Judge's health problems in August 2019, and later, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on development. A free downloadable content pack titled Valhalla was released on December 12, 2023. Serving as an epilogue to Ragnarök, it follows Kratos as he participates in a series of trials within Valhalla, where he must come to terms with his past life in Greece.\nRagnarök garnered universal acclaim from critics and was praised for its storytelling, characters, visuals, level design, and quality of life improvements over its predecessor. Minor criticism focused on some gameplay mechanics, as well as the excessive hints during puzzles. The game sold 5.1 million units in its first week, making it the fastest-selling first-party launch week in PlayStation history, with over 15 million units sold as of November 2023. At The Game Awards 2022, Ragnarök received a leading 11 nominations, including Game of the Year, winning six. It received a leading 12 nominations at the 26th Annual D.I.C.E. Awards, ultimately winning seven awards including Adventure Game of the Year. It received a leading 15 nominations at the 19th British Academy Games Awards, the most nominations for any game in the history of the ceremony, from which it won six awards, including the EE Game of the Year Award.","content":"#Gameplay\n#Synopsis\n##Setting\n##Characters\n##Plot\n###Valhalla\n#Development\n##Casting\n##Pre-release fan backlash\n##Soundtrack\n#Release\n#Reception\n##Sales\n##Awards\n#Future\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Palladian_architecture","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Palladian_architecture","summary":"Palladian architecture is a European architectural style derived from the work of the Venetian architect Andrea Palladio (1508–1580). What is today recognised as Palladian architecture evolved from his concepts of symmetry, perspective and the principles of formal classical architecture from ancient Greek and Roman traditions. In the 17th and 18th centuries, Palladio's interpretation of this classical architecture developed into the style known as Palladianism.\nPalladianism emerged in England in the early 17th century, led by Inigo Jones, whose Queen's House at Greenwich has been described as the first English Palladian building. Its development faltered at the onset of the English Civil War. After the Stuart Restoration, the architectural landscape was dominated by the more flamboyant English Baroque. Palladianism returned to fashion after a reaction against the Baroque in the early 18th century, fuelled by the publication of a number of architectural books, including Palladio's own I quattro libri dell'architettura (The Four Books of Architecture) and Colen Campbell's Vitruvius Britannicus. Campbell's book included illustrations of Wanstead House, a building he designed on the outskirts of London and one of the largest and most influential of the early neo-Palladian houses. The movement's resurgence was championed by Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington, whose buildings for himself, such as Chiswick House and Burlington House, became celebrated. Burlington sponsored the career of the artist, architect and landscaper William Kent, and their joint creation, Holkham Hall in Norfolk, has been described as \"the most splendid Palladian house in England\". By the middle of the century Palladianism had become almost the national architectural style, epitomised by Kent's Horse Guards at the centre of the nation's capital.\nThe Palladian style was also widely used throughout Europe, often in response to English influences. In Prussia the critic and courtier Francesco Algarotti corresponded with Burlington about his efforts to persuade Frederick the Great of the merits of the style, while Knobelsdorff's opera house in Berlin on the Unter den Linden, begun in 1741, was based on Campbell's Wanstead House. Later in the century, when the style was losing favour in Europe, Palladianism had a surge in popularity throughout the British colonies in North America. Thomas Jefferson sought out Palladian examples, which themselves drew on buildings from the time of the Roman Republic, to develop a new architectural style for the American Republic. Examples include the Hammond–Harwood House in Maryland and Jefferson's own house, Monticello, in Virginia. The Palladian style was also adopted in other British colonies, including those in the Indian subcontinent.\nIn the 19th century, Palladianism was overtaken in popularity by Neoclassical architecture in both Europe and in North America. By the middle of that century, both were challenged and then superseded by the Gothic Revival in the English-speaking world, whose champions such as Augustus Pugin, remembering the origins of Palladianism in ancient temples, deemed the style too pagan for true Christian worship. In the 20th and 21st centuries, Palladianism has continued to evolve as an architectural style; its pediments, symmetry and proportions are evident in the design of many modern buildings, while its inspirer is regularly cited as having been among the world's most influential architects.","content":"#Palladio's architecture\n#Venetian and Palladian windows\n#Early Palladianism\n#Neo-Palladianism\n##English Palladian architecture\n##Irish Palladian architecture\n##North American Palladian architecture\n##Palladianism elsewhere\n#Legacy\n#See also\n#Notes, references and sources\n##Notes\n##References\n##Sources\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

It stars Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt, alongside an ensemble cast including Hayley Atwell, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Vanessa Kirby, Esai Morales, Pom Klementieff, Mariela Garriga, and Henry Czerny. In the film, Hunt and his IMF team face off against the Entity, a powerful rogue AI.\nIn January 2019, Cruise announced the next two Mission: Impossible films would be shot back-to-back, with McQuarrie writing and directing both. Returning and new cast members were announced soon after, and Lorne Balfe, who composed the score for Fallout, returned to score. Filming began in Italy in February 2020 but was halted by the COVID-19 pandemic. It resumed later that year and wrapped in September 2021, with other filming locations including Norway, the United Kingdom, and the United Arab Emirates. It is the first film in the series since Mission: Impossible 2 (2000) not to involve J. J. Abrams and the first film in the series not to be produced by Abrams's Bad Robot since Mission: Impossible III (2006). With an estimated budget of $291 million, it is one of the most expensive films ever made.\nDead Reckoning Part One premiered in Rome on June 19, 2023, and was theatrically released in the United States on July 12, 2023, by Paramount Pictures. The film received critical acclaim and grossed $570.6 million worldwide. Despite being the tenth highest grossing film of 2023, its overall budget and competition from the cultural phenomenon \"Barbenheimer\" caused it to underperform at the box office. The film was nominated in two categories at the 96th Academy Awards and the 77th British Academy Film Awards. A sequel is scheduled for release in 2025.","content":"#Plot\n#Cast\n#Production\n##Development and pre-production\n##Filming\n###Polish bridge controversy\n##Post-production\n#Music\n#Marketing\n#Release\n##Home media\n#Reception\n##Box office\n##Critical response\n##Accolades\n##Political impact\n#Sequel\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}
{"title":"Constantine_II_of_Greece","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Constantine_II_of_Greece","summary":"Constantine II (Greek: Κωνσταντίνος Βʹ, romanized: Konstantínos II, pronounced [ˌkonstaˈdinos ðefˈteros]; 2 June 1940 – 10 January 2023) was the last King of Greece, reigning from 6 March 1964 until the abolition of the Greek monarchy on 1 June 1973.\nConstantine was born in Athens as the only son of Crown Prince Paul and Crown Princess Frederica of Greece. Being of Danish descent, he was also born as a prince of Denmark. As his family was forced into exile during the Second World War, he spent the first years of his childhood in Egypt and South Africa. He returned to Greece with his family in 1946 during the Greek Civil War. After Constantine's uncle George II died in 1947, Paul became the new king and Constantine the crown prince. As a young man, Constantine was a competitive sailor and Olympian, winning a gold medal in the 1960 Rome Olympics in the Dragon class along with Odysseus Eskitzoglou and George Zaimis in the yacht Nireus. From 1964, he served on the International Olympic Committee.\nConstantine acceded as king following his father's death in 1964. Later that year, he married Princess Anne-Marie of Denmark, with whom he had five children. Although the accession of the young monarch was initially regarded auspiciously, his reign saw political instability that culminated in the Colonels' Coup of 21 April 1967. The coup left Constantine, as head of state, with little room to manoeuvre since he had no loyal military forces on which to rely. He thus reluctantly agreed to inaugurate the junta, on the condition that it be made up largely of civilian ministers. On 13 December 1967, Constantine was forced to flee the country, following an unsuccessful countercoup against the junta.\nConstantine formally remained Greece's head of state in exile until the junta abolished the monarchy in June 1973, a decision ratified via a referendum in July, which was contested by Constantine. After the restoration of democracy a year later, another referendum was called for December 1974, but Constantine was not allowed to return to Greece to campaign. The referendum confirmed by a majority of almost 70% the abolition of the monarchy and the establishment of the Third Hellenic Republic. Constantine accepted the verdict of the 1974 vote. From 1975 until 1978 he was involved in conspiracies to overthrow the government via a coup, which eventually did not materialize. After living for several decades in London, Constantine moved back to Athens in 2013. He died there in 2023 following a stroke.","content":"#Early life\n##World War II and the exile of the royal family\n##After World War II and return to Greece\n#Crown Prince\n##Education\n##Sailing and the Olympic Games\n#Reign\n##Accession and marriage\n##Apostasia of 1965\n##Greek dictatorship of 1967–1974\n##Royal countercoup of 13 December 1967 and exile\n#Restoration of democracy and the referendum\n#Life in exile after 1974\n##Abortive conspiracies\n##1993 visit to Greece\n##Legal quarrels over the royal properties\n#Later life\n##Death\n#Issue\n#Ancestry\n#Titles, styles and honours\n##Titles and styles\n##National honours\n##Foreign honours\n###Awards\n#See also\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#Further reading\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Hunting_success","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hunting_success","summary":"In ecology, hunting success is the proportion of hunts initiated by a predatory organism that end in success. Hunting success is determined by a number of factors such as the features of the predator, timing, different age classes, conditions for hunting, experience, and physical capabilities. Predators selectivity target certain categories of prey, in particular prey of a certain size. Prey animals that are in poor health are targeted and this contributes to the predator's hunting success. Different predation strategies can also contribute to hunting success, for example, hunting in groups gives predators an advantage over a solitary predator, and pack hunters like lions can kill animals that are too powerful for a solitary predator to overcome.\nSimilar to hunting success, kill rates are the number of animals an individual predator kills per time unit. Hunting success rate focuses on the percentage of successful hunts. Hunting success is also measured in humans, but due to their unnaturally high hunting success, human hunters can have a big effect on prey population and behaviour, especially in areas lacking natural predators, recreational hunting can have inferences for wildlife populations.","content":"#Definition\n#Hunting success in animals\n##List of animals by hunting success rate\n##Reasons for high hunting success\n#Kill rates\n#Factors influencing success\n##Selective feeding\n##Social and solitary predators\n##Hunting methods\n##Environmental influences\n##Vegetative cover\n#In human hunters\n##Hunting success in humans\n##Factors influencing success of human hunters\n##Hunting types and methods\n##Impact\n#See also\n","lang":"en"}

The mob invaded and caused deliberate damage to the Supreme Federal Court, the National Congress Palace and the Planalto Presidential Palace in the Praça dos Três Poderes (English: Three Powers Square), seeking to violently overthrow the democratically elected president Lula, who had been inaugurated on 1 January. Many rioters said their purpose was to spur military leaders to launch a \"military intervention\" (related to a misinterpretation of the 142nd article of the Brazilian constitution and a euphemism for a coup d'état) and disrupt the democratic transition of power.\nAt the time of the riots, neither Lula nor Bolsonaro were in Brasília: Lula was in Araraquara, a city in the countryside of São Paulo, with mayor Edinho Silva and ministers Luiz Marinho, Jader Filho and Waldez Goés, surveying the city after heavy rains in the municipality; Bolsonaro was in Orlando, Florida, where he had been since the last days of 2022, even before the end of his term.\nThe attack occurred a week after Lula's inauguration and followed several weeks of unrest from Bolsonaro's supporters. It took more than five hours for the Brazilian security forces to clear all three buildings of the rioters, which happened at 21:00 BRT (UTC−03:00). The storming of the government buildings drew swift condemnation from governments around the world.\nIn response to the attack, at 18:00 BRT, Lula announced that he had signed a decree authorising a federal state of emergency in the Federal District through the end of January 2023. The Congress was not in session at the time of the attacks, but it swiftly ratified the declaration by 10 January.","content":"#Background\n##Planning, inciting and financing\n#Events\n##Protesters' arrival in Brasília and security preparations\n##March to the Plaza and initial confrontations\n##Attack on the Congress building\n##Attack on the Supreme Court and Presidential Palace\n##Arrests and end of the riots\n#Aftermath\n##Damage and theft\n###Attacks on journalists and photographers\n##Power sabotage\n##Arrests and legal action\n###Fines and damages\n#Reactions\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

With a duration of 148 days, the strike is tied with the 1960 strike as the second-longest labor stoppage that the WGA has performed, only behind the 1988 strike (153 days). Alongside the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike, which continued until November, it was part of a series of broader Hollywood labor disputes. Both strikes contributed to the biggest interruption to the American film and television industries since the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe lack of ongoing film and television productions resulted in some studios having to close doors or reduce staff. The strike also jeopardized long-term contracts created during the media streaming boom: big studios could terminate production deals with writers through force majeure clauses after 90 days, saving them millions of dollars. In addition, numerous other areas within the global entertainment ecosystem were impacted by the strike action, including the VFX industry and prop making studios. Following a tentative agreement, union leadership voted to end the strike on September 27, 2023. On October 9, the WGA membership officially ratified the contract with 99% of WGA members voting in favor of it.

He first found fame as a member of the Byrds, with whom he helped pioneer the genres of folk rock and psychedelia in the mid-1960s, and later as part of the supergroup Crosby, Stills & Nash, who helped popularize the California sound of the 1970s. In addition to his music, Crosby was known for his outspoken personality, politics, and personal troubles; he was sometimes depicted as emblematic of the counterculture of the 1960s.\nAfter a short time performing in the folk music scene, Crosby co-founded the Byrds in 1964. They scored their first number-one hit in 1965 with a cover of Bob Dylan's \"Mr. Tambourine Man\". Crosby appeared on the Byrds' first five albums and the original lineup's 1973 reunion album. In 1968, he formed Crosby, Stills & Nash (CSN) with Stephen Stills and Graham Nash. After the release of their debut album, CSN won the Grammy Award for Best New Artist of 1969. The group later occasionally included Neil Young. The core trio of CSN remained active from 1976 until 2016, and the duo of Crosby & Nash also recorded three gold albums in the 1970s. Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young (CSNY) reunions were held in each decade from the 1970s through the 2000s.\nCrosby released eight solo albums, albeit sporadically, over the course of his career. His solo debut was 1971's If I Could Only Remember My Name. The last five of his solo albums, beginning with Croz (2014), came in the last decade of his life. Additionally, he formed a jazz-influenced trio with his son James Raymond and guitarist Jeff Pevar in CPR.

He was best known for his tenures with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) under his real name and with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) under the ring name Razor Ramon.\nBorn in St. Mary's County, Maryland, Hall began his career in 1984. He rose to prominence after signing with the WWF in May 1992, assuming the name Razor Ramon. While within the company, he won the WWF Intercontinental Championship four times. He departed the company in May 1996, and subsequently signed with rival promotion WCW, where he became a founding member of the New World Order (nWo) faction, along with Hulk Hogan and Kevin Nash. In the company, he became a two-time WCW United States Heavyweight Champion, a one-time WCW World Television Champion, and a seven-time WCW World Tag Team Champion.

{"title":"Lightyear_(film)","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lightyear_(film)","summary":"Lightyear is a 2022 American animated science-fiction action-adventure film produced by Pixar Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures. The film is a spin-off of the Toy Story film series, but does not take place in the same fictional universe as they do; rather, it is presented as a film that characters in the main Toy Story films have seen. Lightyear centers on the character Buzz Lightyear, who in this film is human and not a toy. The film was directed by Angus MacLane and produced by Galyn Susman, from a screenplay and story written by MacLane and Jason Headley, both of whom co-wrote the latter with Matthew Aldrich. It stars Chris Evans as the voice of the title character, with Keke Palmer, Peter Sohn, Taika Waititi, Dale Soules, James Brolin, and Uzo Aduba in supporting roles. The film follows Buzz Lightyear (Evans) operating as a space ranger who, after being marooned on the hostile planet T'Kani Prime with his commander and crew, tries to find a way back home while encountering a threat to the universe's safety.\nThe concept of a human Buzz Lightyear, who exists in a fictional universe within a fictional universe, was first introduced in the 2000 direct-to-video film Buzz Lightyear of Star Command: The Adventure Begins, which was the pilot for the TV series Buzz Lightyear of Star Command (2000–2001). MacLane, an avid science-fiction fan, pitched the idea of a film featuring Buzz Lightyear at Pixar, after finishing work on Finding Dory (2016). The project was officially announced in an investor meeting held by Disney in December 2020. The animators gave the film a \"cinematic\" and \"chunky\" look, evoking the science-fiction films MacLane grew up watching. To design the vehicles of the film, MacLane used Lego pieces to build various ships and pitch them to the designers and artists. For its IMAX scenes, the team used two virtual cameras, a regular camera with a 35mm equivalent sensor, and a larger sensor equivalent to 65 millimeters, a procedure earlier initiated by Pixar in WALL-E (2008). Development on Lightyear lasted for five and a half years, on an approximate $200 million budget. Michael Giacchino composed the film's score, while Ren Klyce served as its sound designer.\nLightyear premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on June 8, 2022, and was theatrically released in the United States on June 17, in RealD 3D, 4DX, Dolby Cinema and IMAX formats. It became the first Pixar film to be released in theaters worldwide since Onward in March 2020, and the first to include scenes specifically formatted for IMAX theaters. Analysts considered the film to be a box-office bomb, grossing $226.4 million worldwide and losing the studio an estimated $106 million.","content":"#Plot\n#Voice cast\n#Production\n##Development\n##Casting\n##Animation and design\n#Music\n#Marketing\n#Release\n##Theatrical\n##Ban and censorship\n##Home media\n#Reception\n##Streaming viewership\n##Box office\n##Critical response\n##Accolades\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

The plan included the announcement of her death, the period of official mourning, and the details of her state funeral. The plan was created as early as the 1960s and revised many times in the years before her death in September 2022.\nThe phrase \"London Bridge is down\" was to be used to communicate the death of the Queen to the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and key personnel, setting the plan into motion. Bodies involved in preparing the plan included various government departments, the Church of England, Metropolitan Police Service, the British Armed Forces, the media, the Royal Parks, London boroughs, the Greater London Authority and Transport for London. Some critical decisions relating to the plan were made by the Queen herself, while some were left to be determined by her successor. Reporting on the preparations, The Guardian described them as \"planned to the minute\" with \"arcane and highly specific\" details.\nSeveral other plans were also created to support the implementation of Operation London Bridge, such as Operation Unicorn (the plan that detailed what was to happen if Elizabeth were to die in Scotland, which she did). Running concurrently with Operation London Bridge were operations concerning King Charles III's accession to the throne and coronation.

{"title":"2022_United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2022_United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections","summary":"The 2022 United States House of Representatives elections were held on November 8, 2022, as part of the 2022 United States elections during incumbent president Joe Biden's term. Representatives were elected from all 435 U.S. congressional districts across each of the 50 states to serve in the 118th United States Congress, as well as 5 non-voting members of the U.S. House of Representatives from the District of Columbia and four of the five inhabited insular areas. Numerous other federal, state, and local elections, including the 2022 U.S. Senate elections and the 2022 U.S. gubernatorial elections, were also held simultaneously. This was the first election after the 2020 redistricting cycle.\nThe Republican Party, led by Kevin McCarthy, won control of the House, defeating Nancy Pelosi and the Democratic Party, which had held a majority in the House since 2019, as a result of the 2018 elections. Although most observers and pundits predicted large Republican gains, they instead narrowly won 4 seats over the 218 seats needed for a majority, as Democrats won several upsets in districts considered Republican-leaning or won by Donald Trump in the 2020 U.S. presidential election, such as Washington's 3rd congressional district. Republicans also won some upsets in districts that Joe Biden won by double-digits, including New York's 4th congressional district. Observers attributed Democrats' surprise over-performance to, among other factors, the issue of abortion in the United States after Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, and the underperformance of multiple statewide and congressional Republican candidates who held extreme views, including refusal to accept the party's 2020 electoral loss. On the other hand, Democrats' political prospects were weighed down by the 2021–2022 inflation spike, which Republicans blamed on President Biden and the Democratic-controlled Congress. The elections marked the first time since 1875 that Democrats won all districts along the Pacific Ocean. This was the first time since 2004 that Republicans gained House seats in consecutive elections.\nGerrymandering during the 2020 U.S. redistricting cycle had a significant impact on the 2022 election results. Republicans made gains as a result of gerrymandering in Florida, Georgia, Tennessee, and Texas, while Democrats made gains as a result of gerrymandering in Maryland, Illinois and New Mexico. Defensive gerrymanders helped both parties hold competitive seats in various states, while Republican gains in New York and Democratic gains in North Carolina and Ohio were made possible because their state supreme courts overturned gerrymanders passed by their state legislatures.\nThe narrow margin by which Republicans won their House majority resulted in historic legislative difficulties in the 118th Congress. Due to a number of Republican holdouts affiliated with the conservative House Freedom Caucus, McCarthy was not elected Speaker of the House until the 15th round of voting, thus marking the first time since 1923 that a speaker was not elected in the first round. This was the smallest Republican majority since 2000.","content":"#Electoral system\n#Results\n##Federal\n##Per state\n##Maps\n#Retirements\n##Democrats\n##Republicans\n#Resignations and death\n##Democrats\n##Republicans\n#Incumbents defeated\n##In primary elections\n###Democrats\n###Republicans\n##In general elections\n###Democrats\n###Republicans\n#Reapportionment\n##Seats with multiple incumbents running\n#Open seats that changed parties\n#Open seats that parties held\n#Newly created seats\n#Vulnerable seats\n##Democratic\n##Republican\n#Closest races\n#Election ratings\n#Special elections\n#Voter demographics\n#Alabama\n#Alaska\n#Arizona\n#Arkansas\n#California\n#Colorado\n#Connecticut\n#Delaware\n#Florida\n#Georgia\n#Hawaii\n#Idaho\n#Illinois\n#Indiana\n#Iowa\n#Kansas\n#Kentucky\n#Louisiana\n#Maine\n#Maryland\n#Massachusetts\n#Michigan\n#Minnesota\n#Mississippi\n#Missouri\n#Montana\n#Nebraska\n#Nevada\n#New Hampshire\n#New Jersey\n#New Mexico\n#New York\n#North Carolina\n#North Dakota\n#Ohio\n#Oklahoma\n#Oregon\n#Pennsylvania\n#Rhode Island\n#South Carolina\n#South Dakota\n#Tennessee\n#Texas\n#Utah\n#Vermont\n#Virginia\n#Washington\n#West Virginia\n#Wisconsin\n#Wyoming\n#Non-voting delegates\n##American Samoa\n##District of Columbia\n##Guam\n##Northern Mariana Islands\n##United States Virgin Islands\n#See also\n#Notes\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Minneapolis","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Minneapolis","summary":"Minneapolis is a city in and the county seat of Hennepin County, Minnesota, United States. With a population of 429,954, it is the state's most populous city as of the 2020 census. Located in the state's center near the eastern border, it occupies both banks of the Mississippi River and adjoins Saint Paul, the state capital of Minnesota. Minneapolis, Saint Paul, and the surrounding area are collectively known as the Twin Cities, a metropolitan area with 3.69 million residents. Minneapolis is built on an artesian aquifer on flat terrain and is known for cold, snowy winters and hot, humid summers. Nicknamed the \"City of Lakes\", Minneapolis is abundant in water, with thirteen lakes, wetlands, the Mississippi River, creeks, and waterfalls. The city's public park system is connected by the Grand Rounds National Scenic Byway.\nDakota people originally inhabited the site of today's Minneapolis. European colonization and settlement began north of Fort Snelling along Saint Anthony Falls—the only natural waterfall on the Mississippi River. Location near the fort and the falls' power—with its potential for industrial activity—fostered the city's early growth. For a time in the 19th century, Minneapolis was the lumber and flour milling capital of the world, and as home to the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, it has preserved its financial clout into the 21st century. A Minneapolis Depression-era labor strike brought about federal worker protections. Work in Minneapolis contributed to the computing industry, and the city is the birthplace of General Mills, the Pillsbury brand, Target Corporation, and Thermo King mobile refrigeration.\nThe city's major arts institutions include the Minneapolis Institute of Art, the Walker Art Center, and the Guthrie Theater. Four professional sports teams play downtown. Prince is survived by his favorite venue, the First Avenue nightclub. Minneapolis is home to the University of Minnesota's main campus. The city's public transport is provided by Metro Transit, and the international airport, serving the Twin Cities region, is located towards the south on the city limits.\nResidents adhere to more than fifty religions. Despite its well-regarded quality of life, Minneapolis has stark disparities among its residents—arguably the most critical issue confronting the city in the 21st century. Governed by a mayor-council system, Minneapolis has a political landscape dominated by the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party (DFL), with Jacob Frey serving as mayor since 2018.","content":"#History\n##Dakota homeland\n##Industries develop\n##Social tensions\n#Geography\n##Neighborhoods\n##Climate\n##Cityscape\n#Demographics\n##Census and estimates\n##Structural racism\n##Religion\n#Economy\n#Arts and culture\n##Visual arts\n##Theater and performing arts\n##Music\n##Historical museums\n##Libraries and literary arts\n##Cuisine\n#Sports\n#Parks and recreation\n#Government\n#Education\n##Primary and secondary\n##Colleges and universities\n#Media\n#Infrastructure\n##Transportation\n##Services and utilities\n##Health care\n#Notable people\n#Sister cities\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Works cited\n##Books\n##Journal articles\n#Further reading\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

It was the largest cross-border attack during the war since the initial beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022.\nOn 1 June, another incursion began near the town of Shebekino, with the RVC announcing that the promised \"second phase\" of the fighting had begun. This time, the Belarusian volunteer Terror Battalion participated in the raid. A spokesman for the Freedom of Russia Legion said their goals were to draw Russian troops away from other parts of the front, and to encourage rebellion against the Russian government. On 12 March 2024, Russian rebels launched another major cross-border operation in Belgorod and Kursk Oblasts.","content":"#Background\n#First raid\n##22 May\n##23 May\n##Aftermath\n#Second raid\n##1–3 June\n##4 June – 15 June\n#Sporadic incursions (June–December 2023)\n#Casualties and losses\n##Pro-Ukrainian forces\n##Russian government forces\n#Humanitarian impact and evacuations\n#Analysis\n##Motivation\n##Ukrainian involvement\n#Reactions\n##Ukraine\n##Russia\n##United States\n#See also\n#Notes\n","lang":"en"}
{"title":"Taylor_Swift:_The_Eras_Tour","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Taylor_Swift:_The_Eras_Tour","summary":"Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour is a 2023 American concert film produced by the singer-songwriter Taylor Swift and directed by Sam Wrench. It documents the Los Angeles shows of the Eras Tour (2023–2024), Swift's sixth headlining concert tour and the highest-grossing tour of all time. Swift struck an unprecedented distribution agreement with AMC Theatres and Cinemark Theatres for the film after negotiations with the major film studios fell through.\nFilming took place in August 2023 across three shows at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, with a budget of $10–20 million and SAG-AFTRA permitting production to proceed amidst its 2023 strike. Swift announced the film later that month, catching studios off guard and causing the release dates of several films that had been set for release on or near October 13 to be moved. The unconventional release strategy was a topic of media discourse; many journalists and industry personnel praised Swift's move to bypass the studios to directly partner with theaters and opined that the move defied the traditional producer–distributor–exhibitor model of releasing films.\nThe film premiered at the Grove in Los Angeles on October 11, 2023, and was released to theaters worldwide on October 13. It was met with significant ticket demand, amassing a record $37 million on its first day of pre-sales in the U.S. and over $100 million in total global pre-sales. The Eras Tour became the highest-grossing concert film of all-time, earning $267.1 million in its limited theatrical run worldwide. It received acclaim from critics, most of whom praised the direction, spectacle, energy, and Swift's artistry and showmanship. An extended cut of the film, subtitled (Taylor's Version), includes performances withheld from the theatrical edit and was released on the streaming service Disney+ on March 14, 2024.","content":"#Synopsis\n#Production\n##Background and development\n##Distribution and ticketing\n#Release\n##Theatrical\n##Streaming and television\n#Impact\n##Affected films\n#Box office\n##Pre-release\n##Performance\n#Reception\n##Critical response\n##Audience reception\n##Accolades\n#Analysis\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

Democratic lieutenant governor John Fetterman won his first term in office, defeating Republican surgeon Mehmet Oz. Fetterman succeeded Republican incumbent senator Pat Toomey, who did not seek re-election after two terms. This was the only U.S. Senate seat to flip parties in the 2022 midterms.\nIn the May 17 primary, Fetterman won the Democratic nomination with 59% of the vote. Oz finished with a 0.1% margin ahead of businessman David McCormick in the Republican primary, triggering an automatic recount. McCormick conceded the nomination on June 3, making Oz the first Muslim candidate to be nominated by either major party for U.S. Senate.\nThe general election was among the most competitive of the 2022 midterms and characterized as highly contentious. Fetterman framed Oz as an elitist carpetbagger with a radical anti-abortion stance in the wake of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization overturning Roe v. Wade, while Oz framed Fetterman as a socialist insufficiently committed to fighting crime. Fetterman's health was also a major issue due to him suffering a stroke days before his primary victory. Although Fetterman led most pre-election polls, concerns towards his health and a scrutinized debate performance helped Oz take a narrow lead before the election.\nDespite Oz's lead in final polls, Fetterman won by a 5% margin, helping provide Senate Democrats a net gain of one seat and their first outright majority since 2015. With Fetterman's victory, elected Democrats held both U.S. Senate seats from Pennsylvania for the first time since 1947.","content":"#Republican primary\n##Campaign\n###Early campaign\n###Entry of Oz and McCormick\n###Late campaign\n##Candidates\n###Nominee\n###Eliminated in primary\n###Disqualified\n###Withdrew\n###Declined\n##Debates and forums\n##Endorsements\n##Polling\n##Results\n#Democratic primary\n##Campaign\n##Candidates\n###Nominee\n###Eliminated in primary\n###Disqualified\n###Withdrew\n###Declined\n##Debates\n##Endorsements\n##Polling\n##Results\n#Libertarian convention\n##Candidates\n###Nominee\n###Withdrew\n#Green convention\n##Candidates\n###Nominee\n#Independents and other parties\n##Candidates\n###Qualified for ballot\n###Declared write-in\n###Withdrew\n#General election\n##Campaign\n###Crudités video\n###Debate\n##Predictions\n##Debates\n##Endorsements\n##Polling\n##Results\n###By county\n###By congressional district\n###Voter demographics\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}
{"title":"Hurricane_Lee_(2023)","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hurricane_Lee_(2023)","summary":"Hurricane Lee was a long-lived and intense tropical cyclone which impacted Bermuda, the Northeastern United States, and Eastern Canada in September 2023. The twelfth named storm, fourth hurricane, and third major hurricane of the 2023 Atlantic hurricane season, Lee formed on September 5 from a tropical wave that had moved offshore from West Africa into the tropical Atlantic a few days earlier. A strong steering current caused the storm to track northwestward, far from the Northern Leeward Islands. Highly favorable conditions enabled Lee to rapidly intensify to a Category 5 hurricane on September 7, its winds increased by 80 mph (130 km\/h) in 24 hours. This makes it the fifth‑fastest rapid intensification on record in the Atlantic, only behind Hurricane Wilma in 2005, Hurricane Felix in 2007, Hurricane Milton in 2024, and Hurricane Matthew in 2016. Just as quickly however, Lee's strength waned, and it fluctuated in intensity for several days on account of strong wind shear and multiple eyewall replacement cycles. \nOn September 13, the system rounded the southwest side of a large ridge of high pressure over the central Atlantic, turned, and accelerated northward. Lee soon entered into an environment of increasing wind shear and moved into increasingly cooler water, causing the system to slowly weaken as it passed near Bermuda and New England, and to undergo the transition into an extratropical cyclone. The cyclone then made landfalls in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and in Newfoundland and Labrador, before moving out into the far northern Atlantic on September 18, where it merged with another extratropical low.\nSwells generated by Lee caused dangerous surf and rip currents along the entire Atlantic coast of the United States. Strong winds with hurricane‑force gusts caused extensive power outages in the U.S. state of Maine, and in the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. Total damage is estimated at USD$80 million as of 2024. Three storm-related fatalities have been confirmed: a 15-year-old boy drowned in Fernandina Beach, Florida; a 51-year-old man died in Searsport, Maine, when a tree fell onto the car he was in; and a 21-year-old man who was killed when the boat he was in was capsized and sunk by a large wave in Manasquan Inlet, New Jersey.","content":"#Meteorological history\n#Preparations and impact\n##Bermuda\n##United States\n###New York\n###Massachusetts\n###Rhode Island\n###New Hampshire\n###Maine\n##Canada\n###New Brunswick\n###Nova Scotia\n###Prince Edward Island\n##Elsewhere\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

The collision, involving the InterCity 62 (IC62) passenger train and an intermodal freight train, killed at least 57 people, with an official number of 342 passengers and 10 onboard railway staff on the passenger train and 2 staff on the freight train totalling 354 people on both trains. It is the deadliest rail disaster in Greek history. It was discovered that the IC62 passenger train had been allowed to proceed on the wrong track and pass signals at danger despite the presence of the freight train on the same stretch of track.\nVigils, angry protests, and clashes with the police occurred throughout Greece following the crash. Beginning on 2 March 2023, railway workers of Hellenic Train and the Athens Metro went on strike to protest the dangers related to the crash. Following the crash, Transport Minister Kostas Karamanlis resigned, taking responsibility for the crash and for his failure to bring Greek railways to 21st-century standards; he was reelected, after applying just two weeks after the incident.\nThe case has generated widespread condemnation of the state's handling of the investigation, which has been labelled as bogus with the alleged intent of prematurely concluding it. As of 2024, no politicians have been subject to investigation regarding their involvement in the events leading up to the disaster. This has prompted an open discussion among citizens and the media concerning the efficacy of the justice system, particularly regarding issues of impartiality and integrity. The government successfully weathered a no-confidence vote on 28 March 2024, despite accusations from the opposition regarding Mitsotakis' handling of the investigation.","content":"#Background\n#Collision\n#Victims\n#Aftermath\n#Investigation\n#Reactions\n##Protests\n##Collection of signatures\n##Documentaries\n#See also\n","lang":"en"}

The Patriots compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the American Football Conference (AFC) East division. The Patriots play home games at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, which is 22 miles (35 km) southwest of Boston. The franchise is owned by Robert Kraft, who purchased the team in 1994. As of 2023, the Patriots are tied for the third-most valuable sports team in the world and have sold out every home game since 1994.\nFounded in 1959 as the Boston Patriots, the team was a charter member of the American Football League (AFL) before joining the NFL in 1970 through the AFL–NFL merger. The Patriots played their home games at various stadiums throughout Boston, including Fenway Park from 1963 to 1969 until the franchise moved to Foxborough in 1971. As part of the move, the team changed its name to the New England Patriots. Home games were played at Foxboro Stadium until 2002 when the stadium was demolished alongside the opening of Gillette Stadium. The team began utilizing Gillette Stadium for home games the same year.\nThe Patriots hold the records for most Super Bowl wins (6, tied with the Pittsburgh Steelers), appearances (11), and losses (5, tied with the Denver Broncos).

{"title":"Gogu_Rădulescu","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gogu_Rădulescu","summary":"Gheorghe \"Gogu\" Rădulescu (5 September 1914 – 24 May 1991) was a Romanian journalist, economist, and high-ranking figure of the communist regime. Of mixed Romani and Russian heritage, he began his leftist and anti-fascist militancy in the early 1930s, while a student at the Commercial Academy in Bucharest. He established a Democratic Students' Front, which embarked on a direct confrontation with the fascist Iron Guard, as well as with the conservative establishment of the Romanian Kingdom; supported by the clandestine Romanian Communist Party (PCR) and its Union of Communist Youth (of which he was a member from 1933), Rădulescu networked with moderate leftists and independents. In 1935, he organized a training camp in Moieciu, which was nearly broken up by the Gendarmes. In 1937, he was kidnapped and tortured by Iron Guard affiliates, and then also expelled from the Communist Youth for his apparent insubordination. Taking his doctorate in 1938, Rădulescu worked as a researcher for the Institute of Economic Conjecture, under his communist friend Belu Zilber.\nDuring the early stages of World War II, Rădulescu was called to serve as a Lieutenant in the Romanian Land Forces. He deserted shortly before, or during, Operation Barbarossa (June 1941), surrendering to the Red Army. He was granted the same status as Romanian prisoners of war, and was transported to camps deep inside the Soviet Union. In 1943, he was recovered by the PCR's exile wing, or \"Muscovite faction\", and was tasked with recruiting Romanian captives for the Tudor Vladimirescu Division. Rădulescu returned in 1946, two years after the Soviet conquest of Romania, and was integrated into the country's new administrative apparatus. He was allowed to join the PCR (or \"Workers' Party\") in 1949, the year when he also rose to the position of Deputy Minister of Foreign Trade. In 1952, he was caught up in the roundup of alleged \"right-wing deviationists\" and wreckers of the economy, and arrested by the Securitate; he was allowed to preserve a teacher's post, and was slowly reintegrated politically, then fully rehabilitated, with the onset of Romanian de-satellization.\nRădulescu became a Minister of Internal Trade in 1956, but established his international profile from 1959, when he was Minister of Trade, and then of Foreign Trade, as well as serving continuously as Deputy Prime Minister in 1963–1979. Embraced by Nicolae Ceaușescu and his national-communists, who took control of the PCR in 1965, Rădulescu was granted a quasi-permanent seat on the Central Committee and its Politburo (or \"Executive Committee\"). He played a part in socialist industrialization by 1970, when he was instrumental in prospecting international markets, especially in developing countries, as well as in negotiating loans with the French Rothschilds. Later that decade, he renounced his positions in government, and was instead assigned to lead the Higher Court of Financial Control. Spurred on by his novelist wife Dorina, and already cultivating the poet Miron Radu Paraschivescu, he established his own literary circle, or \"court\", centered on his rural property in Comana. Rădulescu both undermined and selectively enforced communist censorship—specifically, against his ideological enemy Mircea Eliade; he was seen in the writers' community as rather more liberal than the standard nomenklatura.\nAs protector of the România Literară circle, with a say in the affairs of the Writers' Union, Rădulescu emerged as a selective critic of national-communism—while also fully participating in Ceaușescu's personality cult. In 1986, he took a public stand against \"Protochronism\", which he controversially depicted as an offshoot of interwar fascism. The Securitate followed closely his contacts with other political figures, noting him as a probable conspirator against the regime and a critic of its austerity policies; Rădulescu was still present by Ceaușescu's side throughout the Romanian Revolution of 1989, though he advised against its violent repression. He was immediately after captured and indicted for genocide and economic crimes by the National Salvation Front, but escaped prosecution due to his poor health, and died at a nursing home in 1991. The controversy—surrounding his political positioning, his cultural profile, and his role in various intrigues—was prolonged over the following decades.","content":"#Biography\n##Early life and FSD\n##Wartime desertion and return\n##1952 fall and 1956 recovery\n##With Ceaușescu\n##Patronage and liberalism\n##Protochronism and austerity debates\n##Downfall, prosecution, and death\n#Legacy\n#Notes\n#References\n","lang":"en"}

The Queen had died on 8 September, and had previously lain in rest in St Giles Cathedral in Edinburgh from 12 to 13 September. On official signs the queue was named \"lying-in-state queue\" and in contemporary media coverage it was simply called \"The Queue\".\nTwo separate queues were operated. The main queue had a length of up to 10 miles (16 km) and a maximum waiting time of more than 24 hours; this was the queue that attracted the more media attention. There was also a shorter accessible queue, for people with disabilities or long-term health conditions.\nThe queues opened at 17:00 BST on 14 September. The accessible queue was closed to new entrants at 16:33 on 17 September, and the main queue closed at 22:41 on 18 September. The lying in state ended shortly after 06:30 on 19 September, in advance of Elizabeth II's state funeral later that day. About 250,000 people were estimated to have waited in the queue.\nThe media and academics commented on the significance of the queue as a symbol of the relationship of British people to their monarch, as a social phenomenon, and as reinforcement of the stereotype that British people enjoy queueing and are disciplined at doing so.","content":"#Precedents\n#Routes\n##Main queue\n##Accessible queue\n#Length\n#Organisation\n##Exemptions from queuing\n#Participation and incidents\n#Responses and media coverage\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"History_of_Taiwan","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/History_of_Taiwan","summary":"The history of the island of Taiwan dates back tens of thousands of years to the earliest known evidence of human habitation. The sudden appearance of a culture based on agriculture around 3000 BC is believed to reflect the arrival of the ancestors of today's Taiwanese indigenous peoples. People from China gradually came into contact with Taiwan by the time of the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368) and Han Chinese people started settling there by the early 17th century. The island became known by the West when Portuguese explorers discovered in 16th century and named it Formosa. Between 1624 and 1662, the south of the island was colonized by the Dutch headquartered in Zeelandia in present-day Anping, Tainan whilst the Spanish built an outpost in the north, which lasted until 1642 when the Spanish fortress in Keelung was seized by the Dutch. These European settlements were followed by an influx of Hoklo and Hakka immigrants from Fujian and Guangdong.\nIn 1662, Koxinga defeated the Dutch and established a base of operations on the island. His descendants were defeated by the Qing dynasty in 1683 and their territory in Taiwan was annexed by the Qing dynasty. Over two centuries of Qing rule, Taiwan's population increased by over two million and became majority Han Chinese due to illegal cross-strait migrations from mainland China and encroachment on Taiwanese indigenous territory. Due to the continued expansion of Chinese settlements, Qing-governed territory eventually encompassed the entire western plains and the northeast. This process accelerated in the later stages of Qing rule when settler colonalization of Taiwan was actively encouraged. The Qing ceded Taiwan and Penghu to Japan after losing the First Sino-Japanese War in 1895. Taiwan experienced industrial growth and became a productive rice- and sugar-exporting Japanese colony. During the Second Sino-Japanese War it served as a base for invasions of China, and later Southeast Asia and the Pacific during World War II.\nIn 1945, following the end of hostilities in World War II, the nationalist government of the Republic of China (ROC), led by the Kuomintang (KMT), took control of Taiwan. The legality and nature of its control of Taiwan, including transfer of sovereignty, is debated. In 1949, after losing control of mainland China in the Chinese Civil War, the ROC government under the KMT withdrew to Taiwan where Chiang Kai-shek declared martial law. The KMT ruled Taiwan (along with the islands of Kinmen, Wuqiu and the Matsu) as a single-party state for forty years until democratic reforms in the 1980s. The first-ever direct presidential election was held in 1996. During the post-war period, Taiwan experienced rapid industrialization and economic growth known as the \"Taiwan Miracle\", and was one of the \"Four Asian Tigers\".","content":"#Prehistory\n#Chinese contact and settlement\n#Dutch and Spanish colonies (1624–1668)\n##Contact and establishment\n##Piracy\n##Japanese trade\n##Spanish Formosa\n##Dutch colonization\n##Chinese settlers\n##End of Dutch rule\n#Kingdom of Tungning (1661–1683)\n##Conquest\n##Retreat to Taiwan\n##Sinicization\n##Shi Lang\n##End of Zheng rule\n#Qing dynasty (1683–1895)\n##Annexation\n##Taiwan administration\n##Settler expansion (1684–1795)\n##Administrative expansion (1796–1874)\n##Expansion in reaction to crises (1875–1895)\n##Rebellions\n##Invasions\n##End of Qing rule\n#Japanese Empire (1895–1945)\n##Armed resistance\n##Non-violent resistance\n##Assimilation movement\n##Education\n##Japanization\n##Aboriginal policies\n##Japanese colonists\n##Industrialization\n##World War II\n##End of Japanese rule\n#Republic of China (1945–present)\n##Taiwan under martial law\n##Economic development\n##Democratic reforms\n##Democratic period\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n##Citations\n##Cited sources\n##General references\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

Its three largest metropolitan areas are New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago, and its three most populous states are California, Texas, and Florida.\nPaleo-Indians migrated across the Bering land bridge more than 12,000 years ago, and went on to form various civilizations and societies. British colonization led to the first settlement of the Thirteen Colonies in Virginia in 1607. Clashes with the British Crown over taxation and political representation sparked the American Revolution, with the Second Continental Congress formally declaring independence on July 4, 1776. Following its victory in the 1775–1783 Revolutionary War, the country continued to expand across North America. As more states were admitted, a North-South sectional division over slavery led to the secession of the Confederate States of America, which fought the remaining states of the Union during the 1861–1865 American Civil War. With the Union's victory and preservation, slavery was abolished nationally. By 1900, the U.S. had established itself as a great power, which was solidified after its involvement in World War I. After Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the U.S. entered World War II. Its aftermath left the U.S. and the Soviet Union as the world's two superpowers and led to the Cold War, during which both countries engaged in a struggle for ideological dominance and international influence. Following the Soviet Union's collapse and the end of the Cold War in 1991, the U.S. emerged as the world's sole superpower, wielding significant geopolitical influence globally.\nThe U.S. national government is a presidential constitutional federal republic and liberal democracy with three separate branches: legislative, executive, and judicial. It has a bicameral national legislature composed of the House of Representatives, a lower house based on population; and the Senate, an upper house based on equal representation for each state. Substantial autonomy is provided by federalism, with a political culture promoting liberty, equality, individualism, personal autonomy, and limited government.\nOne of the world's most developed countries, the United States has had the largest nominal GDP since about 1890 and accounted for over 15% of the global economy in 2023. It possesses by far the largest amount of wealth of any country and has the highest disposable household income per capita among OECD countries. The U.S. ranks among the world's highest in economic competitiveness, productivity, innovation, human rights, and higher education. Its hard power and cultural influence have a global reach. The U.S. is a founding member of the World Bank, Organization of American States, NATO, and United Nations, as well as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.","content":"#Etymology\n#History\n##Indigenous peoples\n##European settlement and conflict (1607–1765)\n##American Revolution and the early republic (1765–1800)\n##Westward expansion and Civil War (1800–1865)\n##Post–Civil War era (1865–1917)\n##Rise as a superpower (1917–1945)\n##Cold War (1945–1991)\n##Contemporary (1991–present)\n#Geography\n##Climate\n##Biodiversity and conservation\n#Government and politics\n##National government\n##Political parties\n##Subdivisions\n##Foreign relations\n##Military\n##Law enforcement and criminal justice\n#Economy\n##Science, technology, spaceflight and energy\n##Transportation\n#Demographics\n##Population\n##Language\n##Immigration\n##Religion\n##Urbanization\n##Health\n##Education\n#Culture and society\n##Literature\n##Mass media\n##Theater\n##Visual arts\n##Music\n##Fashion\n##Cinema\n##Cuisine\n##Sports\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n##Sources\n#External links\n##Government\n##History\n##Maps\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Joan_of_Arc","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Joan_of_Arc","summary":"Joan of Arc (French: Jeanne d'Arc [ʒan daʁk]; Middle French: Jehanne Darc [ʒəˈãnə ˈdark]; c. 1412 – 30 May 1431) is a patron saint of France, honored as a defender of the French nation for her role in the siege of Orléans and her insistence on the coronation of Charles VII of France during the Hundred Years' War. Claiming to be acting under divine guidance, she became a military leader who transcended gender roles and gained recognition as a savior of France.\nJoan was born to a propertied peasant family at Domrémy in northeast France. In 1428, she requested to be taken to Charles VII, later testifying that she was guided by visions from the archangel Michael, Saint Margaret, and Saint Catherine to help him save France from English domination. Convinced of her devotion and purity, Charles sent Joan, who was about seventeen years old, to the siege of Orléans as part of a relief army. She arrived at the city in April 1429, wielding her banner and bringing hope to the demoralized French army. Nine days after her arrival, the English abandoned the siege. Joan encouraged the French to aggressively pursue the English during the Loire Campaign, which culminated in another decisive victory at Patay, opening the way for the French army to advance on Reims unopposed, where Charles was crowned as the King of France with Joan at his side. These victories boosted French morale, paving the way for their final triumph in the Hundred Years' War several decades later.\nAfter Charles's coronation, Joan participated in the unsuccessful siege of Paris in September 1429 and the failed siege of La Charité in November. Her role in these defeats reduced the court's faith in her. In early 1430, Joan organized a company of volunteers to relieve Compiègne, which had been besieged by the Burgundians—French allies of the English. She was captured by Burgundian troops on 23 May. After trying unsuccessfully to escape, she was handed to the English in November. She was put on trial by Bishop Pierre Cauchon on accusations of heresy, which included blaspheming by wearing men's clothes, acting upon visions that were demonic, and refusing to submit her words and deeds to the judgment of the church. She was declared guilty and burned at the stake on 30 May 1431, aged about nineteen.\nIn 1456, an inquisitorial court reinvestigated Joan's trial and overturned the verdict, declaring that it was tainted by deceit and procedural errors. Joan has been described as an obedient daughter of the Roman Catholic Church, an early feminist, and a symbol of freedom and independence. She is popularly revered as a martyr. After the French Revolution, she became a national symbol of France. In 1920, Joan of Arc was canonized by Pope Benedict XV and, two years later, was declared one of the patron saints of France. She is portrayed in numerous cultural works, including literature, music, paintings, sculptures, and theater.","content":"#Name\n#Birth and historical background\n#Early life\n#Chinon\n#Military campaigns\n##Orléans\n##Loire Campaign\n##Coronation and siege of Paris\n##Campaign against Perrinet Gressart\n##Siege of Compiègne and capture\n#Trials and execution\n##Trial\n##Execution\n##Aftermath and rehabilitation trial\n#Visions\n#Clothing\n#Legacy\n##Military leader and symbol of France\n##Saint and heroic woman\n#See also\n#References\n##Notes\n##Citations\n##Sources\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Survivor_Series:_WarGames_(2022)","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Survivor_Series:_WarGames_(2022)","summary":"The 2022 Survivor Series: WarGames was the 36th annual Survivor Series professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming event produced by WWE. It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. The event took place on Saturday, November 26, 2022, at TD Garden in Boston, Massachusetts. It was the fourth Survivor Series to be held in Boston after the 1993 (at the original Boston Garden), 2008, and 2013 events. It was also the first Survivor Series to take place on a Saturday and the first since the 1994 event to not take place on a Sunday. This was also the last WWE pay-per-view event to take place before Stephanie McMahon announced her resignation as co-CEO and Chairwoman of WWE, with Vince McMahon subsequently returning as Executive Chairman. It was also WWE's final pay-per-view to be available to livestream on the standalone version of the Australian WWE Network before the launch of Binge's WWE Network channel in Australia on January 23, 2023. Additionally, this was WWE's first pay-per-view to be livestreamed on Disney+ in the Philippines.\nUnlike the Survivor Series events from 2016 to 2021, the 2022 event was not themed around Raw versus SmackDown for brand supremacy. Instead, it was based around the WarGames match, a gimmick match first used in Jim Crockett Promotions and then World Championship Wrestling, the assets of which WWE acquired in 2001. From 2017 to 2021, it was used by WWE's developmental brand, NXT, and held at the brand's annual WarGames event. Survivor Series was in turn branded as \"Survivor Series: WarGames\", marking WWE's first main roster event to feature the match, as well as ending NXT's WarGames event. Due to hosting the WarGames matches, this was the first Survivor Series since the 2002 event to not feature a traditional Survivor Series match, or any type of elimination match, and only the third event to not include one, after the 1998 and 2002 events.\nFive matches were contested at the event, including two WarGames matches. In the main event, which was the main match from SmackDown, The Bloodline (Roman Reigns, Jey Uso, Jimmy Uso, Solo Sikoa, and Sami Zayn) defeated Team Brawling Brutes (Sheamus, Ridge Holland, Butch, Drew McIntyre, and Kevin Owens) in the men's WarGames match, while in the women's WarGames match, which was the opening bout and was the main match from Raw, Team Belair (Bianca Belair, Alexa Bliss, Asuka, Mia Yim, and Becky Lynch) defeated Team Damage CTRL (Bayley, Dakota Kai, Iyo Sky, Nikki Cross, and Rhea Ripley).\nSurvivor Series: WarGames was the highest-grossing Survivor Series of all time, as well as the highest-grossing gate for WWE in Boston. It was also the most-viewed Survivor Series. WWE reported that the event was a complete sellout, with a disputed attendance of 15,609. The event also received critical acclaim, with high praise directed towards the WarGames matches for their storytelling and long-term booking, while also praising AJ Styles vs. Finn Bálor, and the United States Championship triple threat match. Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter would go on to rate a majority of the matches three-and-three-quarters stars or higher, with only the SmackDown Women's Championship match receiving a negative response.","content":"#Production\n##Background\n##Storylines\n#Event\n##Preliminary matches\n##Main event\n#Reception\n##Commercial\n##Critical\n#Aftermath\n##Raw\n##SmackDown\n#Results\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Pishdadian_dynasty","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pishdadian_dynasty","summary":"The Pishdadian dynasty (Persian: دودمان پیشدادیان Dūdmān-i Pīshdādiyān) is a mythical line of primordial kings featured in Zoroastrian belief and Persian mythology. They are presented in legend as originally rulers of the world but whose realm was eventually limited to Ērānshahr or Greater Iran. Although there are scattered references to them in the Zoroastrian scriptures—the Avesta—and later Pahlavi literature, it is through the 11th-century Iranian national epic, the Shahnameh, that the canonical form of their legends is known. From the 9th century, Muslim writers, notably Tabari, re-told many of the Pishdadian legends in prose histories and other works. The Pishdadian kings and the stories relating to them have no basis in historical fact, however.\nAccording to the Shahnameh, the Pishdadians were the first Iranian dynasty, pre-dating the historical Achaemenids, and ruling for a period of over two thousand years. Their progenitor was Keyumars, the first human and the \"Zoroastrian Adam\". He was followed by his descendants who, as kings of the world, fought demons and improved the lives of humankind by introducing them to new knowledge and skills. His most renowned successor, Jamshid, established the main elements of civilization, but, as a result of his pride and hubris, was overthrown by the evil tyrant Zahhak. Following a popular insurrection against Zahhak, the throne was eventually restored to the Pishdadians. However, the next king, Fereydun, divided the world between his three sons with his youngest, Iraj, receiving Iran, the choicest portion, after whom it is named. Iraj and his successors aroused the envy of the other descendants of Fereydun, leading to a lengthy feud and series of wars which eventually caused the downfall of the dynasty. The Shahnameh tells how the Iranians, having no confidence in the last of the Pishdadians, replaced them with another mythical dynasty, the Kayanians.\nTabari repeated many of the same stories in his History, with some variations. As with many of the medieval Muslim writers, he intermixed these stories with narratives relating to Quranic figures, and stories of the prophets, to give them a distinctively Islamic perspective.\nThe stories of the Pishdadian kings have been politically and culturally influential in Iranian society. Both in antiquity and the Middle Ages, ruling dynasties claimed descent from them in order to be imbued with their prestige and political legitimacy. Into the modern era, the tales of the Shahnameh continue to pervade all aspects of Iranian culture and, as part of that, the Pishdadians remain central to Iranians’ sense of the roots of their own history and national identity.","content":"#Origins, etymology and sources\n#The Shahnameh and Zoroastrian tradition\n##Overview\n##The kings\n#Tabari and the Muslim narratives\n##The first Pishdadian kings and the conflict with Iblis\n##From Jam al-Shidh to Zaw: al-Dahhak and war with the Turks\n#Significance\n#Notes\n#References\n#Bibliography\n##Translations of original sources\n##Secondary works cited\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"2024_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2024_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries","summary":"From January 23 to June 8, 2024, presidential primaries and caucuses were organized by the Democratic Party to select the delegates to the 2024 Democratic National Convention, to determine the party's nominee for president in the 2024 United States presidential election. The elections took place in all U.S. states (except for Florida and Delaware), the District of Columbia, five U.S. territories, and Democrats Abroad.\nIncumbent President Joe Biden had repeatedly expressed his intent to run for re-election since 2021, although there was speculation in the first two years of his presidency that he might not seek a second term due to his age and low approval ratings. Former Democratic House representatives, including Carolyn Maloney, Joe Cunningham, and Tim Ryan, had publicly said Biden should not run. There was also speculation that Biden may face a primary challenge, especially from a member of the Democratic Party's progressive faction.\nAfter Democrats outperformed expectations in the 2022 midterm elections, many believed the chances that Biden would run for and win his party's nomination had increased. On April 25, 2023, Biden announced via a video that he would be running for re-election. Eventually, three main primary opponents emerged; self-help author Marianne Williamson declared her candidacy in March, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an anti-vaccine activist and environmental attorney, declared in April, while Representative Dean Phillips declared in October. Additionally, the Uncommitted National Movement, supported by some Muslim Americans, Arab Americans, progressives, and socialists began advocating in 2024 for an uncommitted vote in protest against Biden due to his support for Israel during the Israel–Hamas war.\nKennedy withdrew from the Democratic primaries in October 2023 to run as an independent candidate. Williamson suspended her campaign following the Nevada primary in February 2024, before unsuspending her campaign following the Michigan primary later that month. On March 6, 2024, Phillips suspended his campaign and endorsed Biden. Phillips received the second-highest number of delegates in the primaries (four delegates gained). Biden lost American Samoa to venture capitalist Jason Palmer, becoming the first incumbent president to lose a contest while appearing on the ballot since Jimmy Carter in 1980. However, he won every other contest by a large margin.\nPresident Biden withdrew his candidacy on July 21, following a series of age and health concerns, writing that doing so was \"in the best interest of my party and the country\". He endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as his successor. By the next day, Harris had secured the support of enough delegates to make her the presumptive nominee. Harris became the nominee following a virtual roll call with the support of approximately 98.9% of the delegates and opposition from 52 delegates including notable abstentions from U.S. Representative Mary Peltola, U.S. Representative Jared Golden, and U.S. Senator Jon Tester. Harris is the first Democratic nominee to be nominated despite not actively campaigning in the primaries since Hubert Humphrey in the 1968 United States presidential election.","content":"#Pledged delegates by candidate following primaries\n#Results\n#Candidates\n##Nominee\n##Declined after the primaries\n##Withdrew after the primaries\n##Withdrew during the primaries\n###Other candidates\n##Withdrew before the primaries\n###Other candidates\n#Vice-presidential candidate selection\n#Primaries and caucus calendar\n#Ballot access\n#Timeline\n##2023\n###February 2023\n###March 2023\n###April 2023\n###June 2023\n###September 2023\n###October 2023\n###November 2023\n###December 2023\n##2024\n###January 2024\n###February 2024\n###March 2024\n###April 2024\n###May 2024\n###June 2024\n###July 2024\n###August 2024\n##Overview\n##Early developments\n##Format changes\n##Controversies\n###Primary schedule\n###Ballot access denials\n###Challengers having difficulties\n###Process following Biden's withdrawal\n#Debates and forums\n#Endorsements\n#Opinion polling\n#Campaign finance\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

It was the sixth named storm and fourth typhoon of the 2023 Pacific typhoon season. Khanun started as a low-pressure area in the Pacific Ocean. It rapidly intensified into a Category 4-equivalent typhoon on the Saffir–Simpson scale over the Philippine Sea on August 1, before undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle. Khanun weakened slightly as it moved closer to the Ryukyu Islands, battering them with heavy rain and strong winds. Khanun began to degrade its eye on satellite imagery due to quasi-stationary and warming cloud tops. Steady weakening continued as Khanun approached the Korean Peninsula and it eventually made landfall on Geojedo in South Korea. The storm dissipated shortly thereafter. \nKhanun became the first to pass through the Korean Peninsula from south to north since recordkeeping began in 1951. In South Korea, approximately 40,350 people lost power. At least 159 different facilities were reportedly damaged. More than 1.019 ha (2.52 acres) of farmland in South Gyeongsang Province suffered damage. State media in North Korea reported that Khanun also caused minor damage. In Russia, Khanun brought heavy rains to parts of the Primorsky Krai in the Russian Far East, Russia dispatched a task team to observe the cleanup of areas of the country. A state of emergency was declared in 21 municipalities.13 people have been reported dead and 16 have been reported to have gone missing following the typhoon, another 115 remain injured, and damage totaled at US$98.1 million.","content":"#Meteorological history\n#Preparations, impact, and aftermath\n##Japan\n##Korean Peninsula\n##Elsewhere\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

It marked the climax of the Wagner Group–Ministry of Defense conflict, which had begun about six months earlier. Russian oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin, who had been leading Wagner Group activities in Ukraine, stood down after reaching an agreement a day later.\nAmidst the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Prigozhin had come to publicly express his resentment towards Minister of Defence Sergei Shoigu and Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov; he frequently blamed both men for Russia's military inadequacies, especially during the Wagner-led Battle of Bakhmut, and accused them of handing over \"Russian territories\" to the Ukrainians. He portrayed the Wagner Group's rebellion as his response to the Russian Armed Forces allegedly attacking and killing hundreds of his Wagner mercenaries, which the Russian government denied. Characterizing it as a \"march of justice\" against the Russian military establishment, he demanded that Shoigu and Gerasimov be removed from their positions, and eventually stated that Russia's justification for attacking Ukraine was a lie. In the early morning of 24 June, President of Russia Vladimir Putin appeared in a televised address to denounce the Wagner Group's actions as treason before pledging to quell their uprising.\nWagner mercenaries first seized Rostov-on-Don, where the Southern Military District is headquartered, while an armored column of theirs advanced through Voronezh Oblast and towards Moscow. Armed with mobile anti-aircraft systems, they repelled the Russian military's aerial attacks, which ultimately failed to deter the Wagner column's progress. Ground defenses were concentrated on the approach to Moscow, but before Wagner Group could reach them, President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko brokered a settlement with Prigozhin, who subsequently agreed to halt the rebellion. In the late evening of 24 June, Wagner troops abandoned their push to Moscow and those who remained in Rostov-on-Don began withdrawing.\nIn accordance with Lukashenko's agreement, Russia's Federal Security Service, which had initiated a case to prosecute the Wagner Group for armed rebellion against the Russian state under Article 279 of the Criminal Code, dropped all charges against Prigozhin and his Wagner fighters on 27 June. By the end of the hostilities, at least thirteen Russian soldiers had been killed and several Wagner mercenaries had been injured; Prigozhin stated that two defectors from the Russian military had been killed on Wagner's side as well. On 23 August 2023, exactly two months after the rebellion, Prigozhin was killed in a plane crash alongside other senior Wagner officials.","content":"#Background\n##Yevgeny Prigozhin and the Wagner Group\n##Internal tensions during the invasion of Ukraine\n###Order to integrate Wagner\n##Planning the rebellion\n#Rebellion\n##Prigozhin's statements\n###Rebukes of the government and allegation of an attack on Wagner\n###Call to rebellion\n##Capture of Rostov-on-Don\n##Advance towards Moscow\n##Security measures\n##Events in Syria\n#Resolution\n#Reactions\n##Domestic\n###Vladimir Putin's address\n###Other government-aligned figures\n###Anti-war opposition and anti-government armed groups\n###Ultranationalists and milbloggers\n###Wider public\n##International\n#Aftermath\n##Fallout and restoring order\n##Subsequent statements\n##Fate of the Wagner Group and Yevgeny Prigozhin\n###Closure of criminal case and initial statements\n###Crackdown on Wagner, alleged purges and related arrests\n###Prigozhin's return to Russia\n###Death of Prigozhin and Utkin\n##Measures of NATO countries\n#Analysis\n##Political\n##Military\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

Chemically, nonmetals have relatively high electronegativity or usually attract electrons in a chemical bond with another element, and their oxides tend to be acidic.\nSeventeen elements are widely recognized as nonmetals. Additionally, some or all of six borderline elements (metalloids) are sometimes counted as nonmetals.\nThe two lightest nonmetals, hydrogen and helium, together make up about 98% of the mass of the observable universe. Five nonmetallic elements—hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and silicon—make up the bulk of Earth's atmosphere, biosphere, crust and oceans.\nIndustrial uses of nonmetals include in electronics, energy storage, agriculture, and chemical production.\nMost nonmetallic elements were identified in the 18th and 19th centuries. While a distinction between metals and other minerals had existed since antiquity, a basic classification of chemical elements as metallic or nonmetallic emerged only in the late 18th century. Since then about twenty properties have been suggested as criteria for distinguishing nonmetals from metals.","content":"#Definition and applicable elements\n#General properties\n##Physical\n###Allotropes\n##Chemical\n##Complications\n###First row anomaly\n###Secondary periodicity\n###Higher oxidation states\n###Multiple bond formation\n###Property overlaps\n#Types\n##Noble gases\n##Halogen nonmetals\n##Unclassified nonmetals\n#Abundance, extraction, and uses\n##Abundance\n##Extraction\n##Uses\n#Taxonomical history\n##Background\n##Organization of elements by types\n##Development of types\n##Suggested distinguishing criteria\n#Comparison of selected properties\n##Physical properties by element type\n##Chemical properties by element type\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n##Citations\n##Bibliography\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

Grusch claimed that the U.S. federal government, in collaboration with private aerospace companies, has highly secretive special access programs involved in the recovery and reverse engineering of \"non-human spacecraft\" and their dead pilots.\nGrusch filed a whistleblower complaint in 2022 to Thomas Monheim, the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community, to support sharing classified information with the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. He also filed a complaint alleging retaliation by his superiors over a similar complaint he made the previous year. Grusch claims to have viewed documents reporting a spacecraft of non-human origin had been recovered by Benito Mussolini's government in 1933 and procured by the U.S. in 1944 or 1945 with the assistance of the Vatican and the Five Eyes alliance. Grusch claims that people have been threatened and killed in order to conceal the program. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) denied the claims, stating that extraterrestrial life had yet to be discovered and that there was no evidence supporting the claims of such a program.\nIn a testimony given to the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Accountability in July 2023, Grusch repeated several of his claims under oath. Testimonies were also delivered by Ryan Graves, a former U.S. Navy (USN) fighter pilot, and David Fravor, a USN commander, on their experiences with unidentified flying objects (UFOs). Grusch testified that he could not elaborate further publicly due to the laws behind classified information, but offered to provide further details to the committee in a sensitive compartmented information facility (SCIF).","content":"#Background\n#Grusch's public claims\n#Response from relevant experts\n#United States government responses\n##Department of Defense and NASA statements\n##Congressional action and comments from members\n##2023 House Committee Oversight and Accountability hearing\n#Sean Kirkpatrick\n#Media reporting on Grusch's claims\n##Connections to studies funded by Robert Bigelow\n##Reporting on psychiatric treatment received by Grusch\n##News stories and commentary\n##Disinformation campaign allegations from media pundits\n##Additional responses from media pundits\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}
{"title":"Andhra_Pradesh","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Andhra_Pradesh","summary":"Andhra Pradesh (; ISO: Āndhra Pradēś; Telugu: [aːndʱrɐ prɐdeːʃ]  abbr.  AP) is a state in the southern coastal region of India. It is the seventh-largest state and the tenth-most populous in the country. Telugu, one of India's classical languages, is the primary official language and the most widely spoken language. Amaravati is the state capital, while the largest city is Visakhapatnam. The state shares borders with Telangana to the northwest, Odisha to the northeast, Chhattisgarh to the north, Karnataka to the southwest, Tamil Nadu to the south, and the Bay of Bengal to the southeast. It has the second-longest coastline in India at about 974 km (605 mi).\nArchaeological evidence suggests that Andhra Pradesh has had continuous human presence for over 247,000 years, ranging from early archaic hominins to Neolithic settlements. The earliest mention of the Andhras occurs in Aitareya Brahmana (c. 800 BCE) of the Rigveda. Around 300 BCE, the Andhras living in the Godavari and Krishna river deltas were renowned for their formidable military strength—second only to the Maurya Empire in the subcontinent. The first major Andhra polity was the Satavahana dynasty (2nd century BCE–2nd century CE) which ruled over the entire Deccan Plateau and even distant areas of western and central India. They established trade relations with the Roman Empire. After that, the major rulers included the Vishnukundinas, Eastern Chalukyas, Kakatiyas, Vijayanagara Empire, Qutb Shahis, and the British Raj. After Indian independence, Andhra State was bifurcated from Madras state in 1953. It was merged with Telangana, comprising Telugu speaking areas of the former Hyderabad state, to form Andhra Pradesh in 1956. It reverted to its earlier form on 2 June 2014, when the new state of Telangana was formed through bifurcation.\nThe Eastern ghats separate coastal plains and peneplains. Krishna, Godavari, and Penna are the major rivers. The state has about one-third of India's limestone reserves, large deposits of baryte and granite. The population engaged in agriculture and related activities is 62.17%. Rice is the state's major food crop and staple food. The state contributes to 30% of fish production in India and had a share of 35% in total sea food exports of India. Sriharikota Range at the barrier island of Sriharikota in Tirupati district, is the primary satellite launching station of India.\nAmaravati School of Art, a major ancient Indian art style that influenced South Indian, Sri Lankan, and Southeast Asian art arose from this state. Kuchipudi, one of India's classical dances originated in the state. Several renowned Carnatic music composers trace their origins to the state. The state is home to a variety of pilgrimage centres and natural attractions such as Tirumala Venkateswara temple near Tirupati, Mallikarjuna temple at Srisailam, and Araku valley. \nTirupati Laddu, Banganapalle mangoes, Kondapalli Toys, Dharmavaram sarees, and Pootharekulu are few products produced in the state with geographical indication registration.","content":"#Etymology\n#History\n##Pre-history\n##Early and medieval history\n##Modern history\n#Geography\n##Flora and fauna\n##Mineral resources\n##Climate\n#Demographics\n##Religion\n##Sub categorisaton\n#Culture\n##Clothing\n##Cuisine\n##Literature\n##Architecture\n##Arts\n##Festivals\n#Government and administration\n##Cities and towns\n##Government revenue and expenditure\n#Economy\n##Agriculture\n##Industries\n##Services\n#Infrastructure\n##Transport\n###Roads\n###Railways\n###Airports\n###Sea ports\n##Communication\n##Water\n##Power\n##Healthcare\n##Banking\n#Education\n#Media\n#Sports\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n##Bibliography\n#External links\n##Government\n##General information\n","lang":"en"}
{"title":"Donda_2","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Donda_2","summary":"Donda 2 is a demo album by the American rapper Kanye West. Although unfinished, it was exclusively released on the Stem Player, with four songs made available on February 23, 2022, and additional songs later included in updates, the first of which were added the following day. West began the recording and production of the album in early January 2022, continuing into the next month. It was preceded by the singles \"Eazy\" and \"City of Gods\", released in January and February 2022 respectively—both of which peaked within the top 50 of the US Billboard Hot 100.\nWest held \"Kanye West: Donda Experience Performance\", an accompanying listening party at LoanDepot Park in Miami, Florida on February 22, 2022, selling out 47 IMAX theaters across the United States. The event, plagued by numerous technical failures, found audiences paying regard to the album's drastically unfinished state as it were to release the following day. The \"V2.22.22 Miami\" version of the album was widely panned by music critics, who criticized its subject matter, song structures, and lack of identifiable concept; some were more negative towards West's vocals and lyricism, though a few critics complimented certain elements of the production. Much of West's lyrics on the album are unintelligible. Due to its exclusive Stem Player release, the album was heavily pirated through emulators of the device shared online, leading its circulation on numerous file hosting services. Billboard deemed the album ineligible for its albums charts citing precedented \"bundling\" rules; the album failed to reach any known record charts of the world either.\nAlthough there was expectation that the album would be updated and completed, the project saw no major updates throughout the remainder of 2022. In light of West's series of allegedly antisemitic statements later that year, the Stem Player's parent company Kano Computing dissociated with West and discontinued the original Stem Player. As a result, the album is only available to those who have purchased the original version of Stem Player, released by Yeezy Tech and Kano. Numerous songs from the album in a further state of completeness have since surfaced online through leaks, while others have been reworked and released by other artists.","content":"#Background and recording\n#Music and themes\n#Songs\n##Official releases\n#Promotion and release\n##Events\n#Critical reception\n#Commercial performance\n#Track listing\n#Notes\n","lang":"en"}

The storm was one of the most powerful to impact the south coast of England since the Great Storm of 1987.\nThe storm caused a huge amount of damage in parts of Western, Central and Northern Europe; millions of people were left without power across affected areas, and many homes had sustained damage. The UK was particularly hard hit, with 1.4 million homes left without power at its peak. Several other countries were struck hard by Eunice, with wind damage being mostly the cause of it. Heavy winds damaged parts of buildings, and wind gusts in excess of 120 miles per hour (190 km\/h) were recorded.

{"title":"Morbius_(film)","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Morbius_(film)","summary":"Morbius is a 2022 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name, produced by Columbia Pictures in association with Marvel Entertainment, Arad Productions, and Matt Tolmach Productions, and distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing. It is the third film in Sony's Spider-Man Universe (SSU). Directed by Daniel Espinosa and written by the writing team of Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless, the film stars Jared Leto as Dr. Michael Morbius, alongside Matt Smith, Adria Arjona, Jared Harris, Al Madrigal, and Tyrese Gibson. In the film, Michael and his surrogate brother Milo (Smith) become living vampires after curing themselves of a rare blood disease.\nThere were previously two notable attempts to adapt the character of Michael into a cinematic form since 1998, those being a role in the Blade franchise as an antagonist and having a solo film produced by Artisan Entertainment, neither of which ever came to fruition. After announcing plans for a new shared universe of films inspired by Spider-Man related characters beginning with Venom (2018), Sony began developing a film based on Michael. Sazama and Sharpless had written a script by November 2017, and Leto and Espinosa officially joined in June 2018. Work on the film began at the end of the year with further casting, ahead of production starting in London in February 2019. Filming was confirmed to have been completed by June 2019, with reshoots happening in Los Angeles the following February. Jon Ekstrand was hired to compose the film's score.\nMorbius premiered at the Plaza Carso in Mexico City on March 10, 2022 and was theatrically released in the United States on April 1, after being delayed several times from an initial July 2020 date, primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The film was a critical and commercial failure, receiving criticism for the writing, visual effects, and post-credits scenes, although Smith's performance received some praise; the film also grossed only $167.5 million worldwide. It became the subject of internet memes mocking its reception and quality; the popularity of said memes led Sony to re-release the film in theaters the following June, to another commercial failure. It later received five Golden Raspberry Awards nominations, including Worst Picture, and ended up winning Worst Actor for Leto and Worst Supporting Actress for Arjona.","content":"#Plot\n#Cast\n#Production\n##Development\n##Pre-production\n##Filming\n##Post-production\n#Music\n#Marketing\n#Release\n##Theatrical\n##Home media\n#Reception\n##Box office\n##Critical response\n##Internet memes\n#Future\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

It was the 111th edition of the Australian Open, the 55th in the Open Era, and the first major of the year. The tournament consisted of events for professional players in singles, doubles and mixed doubles. Junior and wheelchair players competed in singles and doubles tournaments. During previous years, the tournament's main sponsor was Kia.\nNovak Djokovic claimed the men's singles title, his tenth Australian Open title and 22nd major title overall, tying Rafael Nadal's all-time record. Djokovic was allowed to play this year despite remaining unvaccinated from COVID-19 after his three-year ban was lifted. The ban was initially handed to him after he was deported in 2022, as Australia's laws required foreigners to be vaccinated for entering the country when the tournament was played in 2022, but the ban was lifted as the vaccination requirement has been lifted. Nadal was the defending champion, but lost to Mackenzie McDonald in the second round. Aryna Sabalenka won the women's title, her first major singles title. Ashleigh Barty was the reigning champion in the women's singles, but she retired from the sport in March 2022.\nSpectators returned to full capacity for the first time since 2020, targeting to exceed 900,000 fans, after capacity restrictions in the last two events due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nTo mark the seventieth anniversary of his first singles title in 1953, Ken Rosewall presented the men's singles trophy to the champion. Billie Jean King presented the women's singles trophy, on the fifty-fifth anniversary of her 1968 victory.\nWith the elimination of world No. 1 Iga Świątek in the fourth round by Elena Rybakina, this became the first edition of the Australian Open in the Open Era to feature neither of the top two singles seeds of either gender in the quarterfinals.\nThis was the last Australian Open Tennis Championships to be held on an opening Monday and from January 2024, the tournament will begin on a Sunday which will take place on 14 January 2024.","content":"#Singles players\n#Events\n##Men's singles\n##Women's singles\n##Men's doubles\n##Women's doubles\n##Mixed doubles\n##Wheelchair men's singles\n##Wheelchair women's singles\n##Wheelchair quad singles\n##Wheelchair men's doubles\n##Wheelchair women's doubles\n##Wheelchair quad doubles\n##Boys' singles\n##Girls' singles\n##Boys' doubles\n##Girls' doubles\n#Point distribution and prize money\n##Point distribution\n###Senior points\n##Prize money\n#Controversy\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. The event took place as a two-night event on April 1 and 2, 2023, at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California—the original location of WrestleMania 37 before the COVID-19 pandemic forced it to be relocated. WWE wrestler The Miz and rapper Snoop Dogg served as the hosts for the event.\nWrestleMania 39 was the sixth to be held in Greater Los Angeles (after 2, VII, XII, 2000, and 21), and the seventh in the state of California overall (including 31, which was held in the San Francisco Bay Area). It was the first WrestleMania to livestream on Binge in Australia. This would subsequently be the final WrestleMania in which WWE was still owned and controlled by the McMahon family as on April 3, the day after the event, it was confirmed that the company had been sold to Endeavor. The sale was finalized on September 12, with WWE merging with Ultimate Fighting Championship to become divisions of a new entity called TKO Group Holdings.\nThe card comprised a total of 15 matches, with eight on Night 1 and seven on Night 2. In the main event for Night 1, Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn defeated The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso) to win the Undisputed WWE Tag Team Championship, ending the latter's record setting male tag team title reign at 622 days. This was also the first time a tag team championship match was the main event of a WrestleMania, and only the second time a tag team match in general was the main event, after WrestleMania I in March 1985. In other prominent matches, Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins defeated Logan Paul, Rey Mysterio defeated Dominik Mysterio, Rhea Ripley defeated Charlotte Flair to win the SmackDown Women's Championship, and in the opening bout, Austin Theory defeated John Cena to retain Raw's United States Championship. The event also included the in-ring return of Pat McAfee, who wrestled his first match since the 2022 SummerSlam, as well as the in-ring WWE debut of Snoop Dogg, who both defeated The Miz in impromptu matches, with the latter occurring on Night 2.\nIn the main event for Night 2, Roman Reigns defeated Cody Rhodes to retain the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship. This subsequently made Reigns the second wrestler after Hulk Hogan to enter three consecutive WrestleManias as world champion during the same reign but it made him the only wrestler to defend a world championship at each. In other prominent matches, Edge defeated \"The Demon\" Finn Bálor in a Hell in a Cell match, Gunther defeated Sheamus and Drew McIntyre in a triple threat match to retain SmackDown's Intercontinental Championship, Bianca Belair defeated Asuka to retain the Raw Women's Championship, and in the opening bout, Brock Lesnar defeated Omos. Night 2 was also notable for the return of Shane McMahon, who last appeared at the 2022 Royal Rumble.\nThe event received generally positive reviews from critics; the Undisputed WWE Tag Team Championship, the Intercontinental Championship, and the SmackDown Women's Championship matches were singled out as highlights throughout the entire event, with the former two rated five stars by Dave Meltzer. Although noting the event's repetitiveness, critics also praised the Men's WrestleMania Showcase fatal four-way tag team match, Logan Paul vs. Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins, Rey Mysterio vs. Dominik Mysterio, and the Hell in a Cell match. WWE's use of Auschwitz footage in a staged video promoting the Mysterio match drew criticism for exploiting genuine historic footage, leading WWE to apologize and state its inclusion was due to an editing error.","content":"#Production\n##Background\n##Broadcast outlets\n##Celebrity involvement\n##Other WrestleMania Week events\n##Promotional movie parodies\n##Storylines\n###Main event matches\n###Undercard matches\n###Canceled match\n#Event\n##Night 1\n###Preliminary matches\n###Main event\n##Night 2\n###Preliminary matches\n###Main event\n#Reception\n##Auschwitz imagery controversy\n#Aftermath\n##Raw\n##SmackDown\n#Results\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"2022_Pennsylvania_gubernatorial_election","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2022_Pennsylvania_gubernatorial_election","summary":"The 2022 Pennsylvania gubernatorial election was held on November 8, 2022, to elect the governor of Pennsylvania and lieutenant governor of Pennsylvania. Democratic state attorney general Josh Shapiro defeated Republican state senator Doug Mastriano to win his first term in office. Shapiro succeeded Democratic incumbent Tom Wolf, who was term limited.\nIn the primaries on May 17, 2022, Shapiro was unopposed for the Democratic nomination. Mastriano, who was endorsed by former president Donald Trump, won the Republican nomination with 44% of the vote over former congressman Lou Barletta and former U.S. Attorney William McSwain. Although the election was expected to be competitive due to Pennsylvania's reputation as a swing state, Mastriano had trouble fundraising, made few media appearances, committed multiple gaffes, was accused of antisemitism against Shapiro, and generated controversy from his far-right positions. Mastriano's struggles helped Shapiro take a strong polling lead that continued up to the election.\nShapiro defeated Mastriano by almost 15 points, the largest margin for a non-incumbent candidate for Pennsylvania governor since 1946, and earned the most votes of a Pennsylvania gubernatorial candidate at just over three million.

The victory also marked the first time since 1844 that the Democratic Party won three consecutive gubernatorial elections in Pennsylvania. According to Ron Brownstein of CNN in 2023, Shapiro won independent voters by 31 percentage points, which contributed to Mastriano's defeat.","content":"#Democratic primary\n##Governor\n###Campaign\n###Candidates\n####Nominee\n####Failed to qualify for ballot access\n####Declined\n###Endorsements\n###Results\n##Lieutenant governor\n###Candidates\n####Nominee\n####Eliminated in primary\n####Declined\n####Withdrew\n###Endorsements\n###Results\n#Republican primary\n##Governor\n###Candidates\n####Nominee\n####Eliminated in primary\n####Withdrew\n####Declined\n###Debates and forums\n###Endorsements\n###Polling\n###Results\n##Lieutenant governor\n###Candidates\n####Nominee\n####Eliminated in primary\n###Declined\n###Endorsements\n###Results\n#Libertarian nomination\n##Governor\n###Nominee\n###Eliminated in board vote\n###Withdrew\n##Lieutenant governor\n###Nominee\n###Withdrew\n#Green convention\n##Governor\n###Nominee\n###Withdrew\n##Lieutenant governor\n###Nominee\n#Keystone nomination\n##Governor\n###Nominee\n###Withdrew\n##Lieutenant governor\n###Nominee\n#General election\n##Campaign\n##Predictions\n##Endorsements\n##Fundraising\n##Polling\n##Results\n##By county\n###By congressional district\n#Analysis\n##Voter demographics\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"2023_Turkey–Syria_earthquakes","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2023_Turkey–Syria_earthquakes","summary":"On 6 February 2023, at 04:17 TRT (01:17 UTC), a Mw 7.8 earthquake struck southern and central Turkey and northern and western Syria. The epicenter was 37 km (23 mi) west–northwest of Gaziantep. The earthquake had a maximum Mercalli intensity of XII (Extreme) around the epicenter and in Antakya. It was followed by a Mw 7.7 earthquake at 13:24. This earthquake was centered 95 km (59 mi) north-northeast from the first. There was widespread damage and tens of thousands of fatalities.\nThe Mw 7.8 earthquake is the largest in Turkey since the 1939 Erzincan earthquake of the same magnitude, and jointly the second-largest in the country, after larger estimates for the 1668 North Anatolia earthquake. It is also one of the strongest earthquakes ever recorded in the Levant. It was felt as far as Egypt and the Black Sea coast of Turkey. There were more than 30,000 aftershocks in the three months that followed. The seismic sequence was the result of shallow strike-slip faulting along segments of the Dead Sea Transform, East Anatolian and Sürgü–Çardak faults.\nThere was widespread damage in an area of about 350,000 km2 (140,000 sq mi), about the size of Germany. An estimated 14 million people, or 16 percent of Turkey's population, were affected. Development experts from the United Nations estimated that about 1.5 million people were left homeless.\nThe confirmed death toll in Turkey was 53,537; estimates of the number of dead in Syria were between 5,951 and 8,476. It is the deadliest earthquake in what is now present-day Turkey since the 526 Antioch earthquake and the deadliest natural disaster in its modern history. It is also the deadliest in present-day Syria since the 1822 Aleppo earthquake; the deadliest worldwide since the 2010 Haiti earthquake; and the fifth-deadliest of the 21st century. Damages were estimated at US$148.8 billion in Turkey, or nine-percent of the country's GDP, and US$14.8 billion in Syria.\nDamaged roads, winter storms, and disruption to communications hampered the Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency's rescue and relief effort, which included a 60,000-strong search-and-rescue force, 5,000 health workers and 30,000 volunteers. Following Turkey's call for international help, more than 141,000 people from 94 countries joined the rescue effort.","content":"#Tectonic setting\n##Geology\n##Seismicity\n#Earthquake sequence\n##Aftershocks\n##Seismology\n##Rupture propagation\n##Surface rupture\n##Ground motion\n##Geological effects\n##Tsunami\n##Effects on other faults\n#Damage and casualties\n##In Turkey\n##In Syria\n##Foreign casualties\n##Effects in other countries\n##Aftershocks\n##Estimations of losses\n#Aftermath\n##Turkey\n###Search and rescue\n###Charity and volunteer campaigns\n###Government assistance\n###Incidents\n###Crime and conflict\n###Floods\n###2023 elections\n###Education\n###Sports\n##Syria\n#International humanitarian efforts\n##Countries\n##Arab League\n##ASEAN\n##European Union (EU)\n##North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)\n##United Nations (UN)\n##World Bank\n#Reactions\n##Criticism of the Turkish government\n###Disaster management\n###Media\n##Criminal investigation in Turkey\n##National mourning\n##Criticism by the Syrian government and opposition\n##Health concerns\n#Commemorations\n#See also\n#References\n##Notes\n##Citations\n##Sources\n#Further reading\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Albert_Cordingley","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Albert_Cordingley","summary":"Albert Cordingley (13 May 1871 – 27 April 1945) was an English professional cricketer from Yorkshire who played first-class cricket for Sussex in the early years of the 20th century. \nCordingley turned professional at age 22, becoming a club pro at Lytham in Lancashire and compiling four seasons of increasingly impressive performances which brought him to the attention of Yorkshire, who hired him at the end of 1897 as a potential replacement for left-arm spin bowler Bobby Peel, who had been dismissed. He played for the Yorkshire 2nd XI the following year, as well as in one non first-class match with the first XI against Worcestershire, but then rejected the offer of a place in the Yorkshire first team squad as backup to Wilfred Rhodes and returned to club cricket, this time at Wiseton in Nottinghamshire. Again he was spotted by a first-class county, and after a successful private trial he was offered a contract by Sussex and accepted despite the fact that he would have to wait two years before officially qualifying to play for his new county.  \nHe moved south and determinedly worked his way back up from club cricket to make his first-class debut in 1901 at the age of 30 for Sussex. His two best performances for the county both occurred early in the following season; he took a five-wicket haul against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge, and shared a record 115-run 9th-wicket partnership with test-player \"Ranji\" (K. S. Ranjitsinhji) against Surrey at The Oval, going on to appear in 10 matches for the Sussex first XI that season. He was sparingly used though, bowling just over 100 overs, and was dropped from the first team for the following two seasons but stayed contracted to Sussex and was recalled in 1905 to play four final matches for them. \nFollowing his relatively short first-class career, he returned to full-time club cricket in 1906 and played until 1911 for East Grinstead, serving as the club pro from 1907. He remained involved in cricket for the rest of his life, devoting over 25 years to the village club at Pease Pottage, near Crawley, Sussex, as a player, coach, groundsman, and umpire after joining it in 1912, as well as making guest appearances for several other Sussex clubs. Having honed his groundskeeping skills earlier in his career at Lytham and Wiseton, and on the ground staff at Hove, he prepared a pitch at Pease Pottage that was considered to be of county cricket standard, seeing some of the highest batting totals in Sussex scored on it. Tragically, the cricket ground was ploughed up in 1940 after the advent of World War II to serve as allotments for the war effort, never to see cricket played on it again, and the club disbanded after many of its players had left to join the British armed forces.\nAmong the most notable wickets he took at different stages of his career as a bowler were those of John Tunnicliffe, Arthur Shrewsbury, and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. He was also a substitute fielder for Yorkshire in a match against M.C.C. at Lord's in 1898 and took to the pitch while W. G. Grace, one of the greatest cricketers of all time, was batting.","content":"#Early life and development as an amateur cricketer (1871-1893)\n#Professional cricket career (1894-1920)\n##Lytham, Lancashire (1894–1897)\n##Yorkshire County Cricket Club (1897-1898)\n##Wiseton, Nottinghamshire (1899)\n##Sussex County Cricket Club (1900-1905)\n##East Grinstead, Sussex (1906-1911)\n##Pease Pottage, Sussex (1912-1920)\n#Post-professional playing career (1921-29)\n#Groundskeeping and coaching\n#Demise of Pease Pottage Cricket Club\n#Quirks of playing career\n#Other sports\n#Death\n#Legacy\n#Sussex First-class playing record\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Campbell's_Soup_Cans","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Campbell's_Soup_Cans","summary":"Campbell's Soup Cans (sometimes referred to as 32 Campbell's Soup Cans) is a work of art produced between November 1961 and June 1962 by the American artist Andy Warhol. It consists of thirty-two canvases, each measuring 20 inches (51 cm) in height × 16 inches (41 cm) in width and each consisting of a painting of a Campbell's Soup can—one of each of the canned soup varieties the company offered at the time. The works were Warhol's hand-painted depictions of printed imagery deriving from commercial products and popular culture and belong to the pop art movement.\nWarhol was a commercial illustrator before embarking on painting. Campbell's Soup Cans was shown on July 9, 1962, in Warhol's first one-man gallery exhibition at the Ferus Gallery of Los Angeles, California, curated by Irving Blum. The exhibition marked the West Coast debut of pop art. Blum owned and possessed the painting series until he loaned it to the National Gallery of Art for several years in 1987 and then sold it to the Museum of Modern Art in 1996. The subject matter initially caused offense, in part for its affront to the technique and philosophy of the earlier art movement of abstract expressionism. Warhol's motives as an artist were questioned. Warhol's association with the subject led to his name becoming synonymous with the Campbell's Soup Can paintings.\nWarhol produced a wide variety of art works depicting Campbell's Soup cans during three distinct phases of his career, and he produced other works using a variety of images from the world of commerce and mass media. After considering litigation, the Campbell Soup Company embraced Warhol's Campbell's Soup cans theme. Today, the Campbell's Soup cans theme is generally used in reference to the original set of 32 canvases, but it also refers to other Warhol productions: approximately 20 similar Campbell's Soup painting variations also made in the early 1960s; 20 3 feet (91 cm) in height × 2 feet (61 cm) in width, multi-colored canvases from 1965; related Campbell's Soup drawings, sketches, and stencils over the years; two different 250-count 10-element sets of screen prints produced in 1968 and 1969; and other inverted\/reversed Campbell's Soup can painting variations in the 1970s. Because of the eventual popularity of the entire series of similarly themed works, Warhol's reputation grew to the point where he was not only the most-renowned American pop-art artist, but also the highest-priced living American artist.\nThere is some confusion because sometimes the later screen print sets are referred to as if they are the Campbell's Soup Can set, and sometimes the original set of painting canvases is referred to as if it is a set of screenprints. In addition, there is ongoing production and sale of unauthorized screen prints, of what is legally Warhol's intellectual property, as a result of a falling out with former employees. There are also varied explanations for this theme. The popular explanation of his choice of the Campbell's Soup cans theme is that one artistic acquaintance inspired the original series with a suggestion that brought him closer to his roots. There are other artists who are said to have also influenced the pursuit of this theme.","content":"#Early career\n##New York art scene\n##Pop art\n#Premiere\n##Subsequent publicity\n#Campbell's Soup Company\n##Can and label history\n##Relation to Warhol's art\n#Inspiration\n##Artist colleagues\n#Interpretation\n#Variations\n##Campbell's Soup I and Campbell's Soup Cans II\n##Colored soup cans\n##Unauthorized versions\n##Other variations\n#Conclusion\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}
{"title":"Artemis_I","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Artemis_I","summary":"Artemis I, formerly Exploration Mission-1 (EM-1), was an uncrewed Moon-orbiting mission that was launched in November 2022. As the first major spaceflight of NASA's Artemis program, Artemis I marked the agency's return to lunar exploration after the conclusion of the Apollo program five decades earlier. It was the first integrated flight test of the Orion spacecraft and Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, and its main objective was to test the Orion spacecraft, especially its heat shield, in preparation for subsequent Artemis missions. These missions seek to reestablish a human presence on the Moon and demonstrate technologies and business approaches needed for future scientific studies, including exploration of Mars.\nThe Orion spacecraft for Artemis I was stacked on October 20, 2021, and on August 17, 2022, the fully stacked vehicle was rolled out for launch after a series of delays caused by difficulties in pre-flight testing. The first two launch attempts were canceled due to a faulty engine temperature reading on August 29, 2022, and a hydrogen leak during fueling on September 3, 2022. Artemis I was launched on November 16, 2022, at 06:47:44 UTC (01:47:44 EST).\nArtemis I was launched from Launch Complex 39B at the Kennedy Space Center. After reaching Earth orbit, the upper stage carrying the Orion spacecraft separated and performed a trans-lunar injection before releasing Orion and deploying ten CubeSat satellites. Orion completed one flyby of the Moon on November 21, entered a distant retrograde orbit for six days, and completed a second flyby of the Moon on December 5.\nThe Orion spacecraft then returned and reentered the Earth's atmosphere with the protection of its heat shield, splashing down in the Pacific Ocean on December 11. The mission aims to certify Orion and the Space Launch System for crewed flights beginning with Artemis II, which is scheduled to perform a crewed lunar flyby no earlier than September 2025. After Artemis II, Artemis III will involve a crewed lunar landing, the first in five decades since Apollo 17.","content":"#Mission profile\n##Mission profile animation\n#Background\n##Ground testing\n##Assembly\n##Launch preparations\n##Initial launch attempts\n#Flight\n##Launch\n##Outbound flight\n##Lunar orbit\n##Return flight\n##Reentry and splashdown\n#Payloads\n##Cubesats\n#Media outreach\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}
{"title":"2022_Australian_federal_election","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2022_Australian_federal_election","summary":"The 2022 Australian federal election was held on Saturday 21 May 2022 to elect members of the 47th Parliament of Australia. The incumbent Liberal\/National Coalition government, led by Prime Minister Scott Morrison, sought to win a fourth consecutive term in office but was defeated by the opposition Labor Party, led by Anthony Albanese. Up for election were all 151 seats in the lower house, the House of Representatives, as well as 40 of the 76 seats in the upper house, the Senate.\nThe Australian Labor Party achieved a majority government for the first time since 2007, winning 77 seats in the House of Representatives. Albanese was sworn in as Prime Minister on 23 May 2022, becoming the fourth Labor leader to win government from opposition since World War II, after Gough Whitlam in 1972, Bob Hawke in 1983, and Kevin Rudd in 2007. Every state and territory except Tasmania swung to Labor on a two-party-preferred basis. The largest two-party preferred swing was in Western Australia (10.6%), where Labor won a majority of seats for the first time since 1990. The Coalition suffered severe losses, winning 58 seats, its lowest share in the House of Representatives since 1946, the first federal election contested by the Liberal Party. On election night, Morrison conceded defeat and announced he would resign as Liberal leader, and was subsequently replaced by Peter Dutton.\nWhile the Coalition was soundly defeated, Labor did not achieve a landslide victory, as a result of electoral successes by independent candidates and the Australian Greens, with the crossbench swelling to 16 seats. Six formerly safe Liberal seats in urban and suburban areas, most held by the party and its predecessors for decades, were won by teal independents, unseating Liberal incumbents including Treasurer and Deputy Liberal Leader Josh Frydenberg. The Liberals also suffered large swings in a number of suburban seats that had long been reckoned as Liberal heartland. The Greens increased their vote share and won four seats, gaining three seats in inner-city Brisbane, the first time in the party's history it won more than one seat in the lower house. The combined major party vote for Labor and the Coalition was the lowest on record at 68.3%, while the minor party and independent vote was at its highest at 31.7%. Compared to 2019, Labor's primary vote dropped much less than the Coalition's, though Labor nevertheless recorded its lowest primary vote since either 1903 or 1934, depending on whether the Lang Labor vote is included.\nIn the Senate, Labor won 15 seats and retained its 26 seats overall in the chamber, while the Coalition fell to 32 seats, a four-seat drop from the previous parliament. The Greens won a seat in every state, an increase of 3 for a total of 12 seats overall, the party's largest ever representation in the Senate. One Nation returned its leader Pauline Hanson in Queensland to retain 2 seats overall, while the Jacqui Lambie Network won an additional seat in Tasmania to have 2 seats. In the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), independent candidate David Pocock won the second of two seats, the first time an ACT senator was not a Labor or Liberal party member. Lastly, a United Australia Party candidate won the sixth seat in Victoria. Labor required 13 votes from a crossbench of 18 (including 12 Greens) to ensure passage of legislation not supported by the Coalition.\nThe voter turnout of 89.82% in this election was the lowest in modern history, falling below 90% for the first time since 1922, prior to the introduction of compulsory voting in Australia.","content":"#Background\n##Previous election\n##Composition of parliament\n##Events of the 46th Parliament\n##Change in party registration rules\n##Party preselection issues\n##Independents\n#Electoral system\n#State of electorates\n##Redistribution\n##Election pendulum (House of Representatives)\n#Voter registration\n#Election date\n##Dissolution of parliament\n#Election timeline\n#Campaign events\n##Leaders' debates\n##Campaign\n##Preferences\n#Candidates\n##Parties\n#Retiring members\n##Labor\n##Liberal\n##Nationals\n#Opinion polling\n#Newspaper endorsements\n##Weekend editions\n##Metropolitan daily newspapers\n##Online publications\n##Regional newspapers\n#Results\n##House of Representatives\n##Senate\n#Seats changing hands\n#Maps\n#Aftermath and reactions\n##Domestic reactions\n##International reactions\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Atomic_clock","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Atomic_clock","summary":"An atomic clock is a clock that measures time by monitoring the resonant frequency of atoms. It is based on atoms having different energy levels. Electron states in an atom are associated with different energy levels, and in transitions between such states they interact with a very specific frequency of electromagnetic radiation. This phenomenon serves as the basis for the International System of Units' (SI) definition of a second:\n\nThe second, symbol s, is the SI unit of time. It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the caesium frequency, \n  \n    \n      \n        Δ\n        \n          ν\n          \n            Cs\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\Delta \\nu _{\\text{Cs}}}\n  \n, the unperturbed ground-state hyperfine transition frequency of the caesium-133 atom, to be 9192631770 when expressed in the unit Hz, which is equal to s−1.\n\nThis definition is the basis for the system of International Atomic Time (TAI), which is maintained by an ensemble of atomic clocks around the world. The system of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) that is the basis of civil time implements leap seconds to allow clock time to track changes in Earth's rotation to within one second while being based on clocks that are based on the definition of the second, though leap seconds will be phased out in 2035.\nThe accurate timekeeping capabilities of atomic clocks are also used for navigation by satellite networks such as the European Union's Galileo Programme and the United States' GPS. The timekeeping accuracy of the involved atomic clocks is important because the smaller the error in time measurement, the smaller the error in distance obtained by multiplying the time by the speed of light is (a timing error of a nanosecond or 1 billionth of a second (10−9 or 1⁄1,000,000,000 second) translates into an almost 30-centimetre (11.8 in) distance and hence positional error).\nThe main variety of atomic clock uses caesium atoms cooled to temperatures that approach absolute zero. The primary standard for the United States, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)'s caesium fountain clock named NIST-F2, measures time with an uncertainty of 1 second in 300 million years (relative uncertainty 10−16). NIST-F2 was brought online on 3 April 2014.","content":"#History\n##Definition of the second\n##Metrology advancements and optical clocks\n##Chip-scale atomic clocks\n#Measuring time with atomic clocks\n##Clock mechanism\n##Tuning and optimization\n#Accuracy\n#Comparing atomic clocks\n##Time standards\n##Synchronization with satellites\n##International timekeeping\n##Fiber Optics\n#Microwave atomic clocks\n##Caesium\n###Block diagram\n##Rubidium\n##Hydrogen\n#Other types of atomic clocks\n##Quantum clocks\n##Nuclear clock concept\n#Potential for redefining the second\n##Rydberg constant\n##Requirements\n##Secondary representations of the second\n#Applications\n##Global navigation satellite systems\n###Experimental space clock\n###Military usage\n##Time signal radio transmitters\n##General relativity\n##Financial systems\n##Transportable Optical Clocks\n#See also\n#Explanatory notes\n","lang":"en"}

The film serves as the first instalment of a planned trilogy, which is itself planned to be part of a cinematic universe titled Āstraverse, and stars an ensemble cast including Amitabh Bachchan, Kapoor, Alia Bhatt, Mouni Roy and Nagarjuna with Shah Rukh Khan in a special appearance. Drawing inspiration from tales in Hindu mythology, the story follows Shiva, an orphan musician with pyrokinetic powers who discovers that he is an astra, a weapon of enormous energy. He attempts to prevent the strongest of the astras, the Brahmāstra, from falling into the hands of dark forces that share a history with him.\nThe film was first conceived by Mukerji in 2011, with core elements inspired by Indian history and stories he heard in his childhood. Its development was first revealed in July 2014 with a planned release for 2016, but its official announcement arrived in October 2017 revealing that the film would be titled Brahmāstra and would be a trilogy. Principal photography lasted from February 2018 to March 2022, with filming locations including Bulgaria, London, New York City, Edinburgh, Thailand, Manali, Mumbai and Varanasi. Production and release of the film were delayed multiple times, first due to production delays and monetary constraints, and later due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The film's songs are composed by Pritam, with soundtrack lyrics written by Amitabh Bhattacharya.\nBrahmāstra: Part One – Shiva was theatrically released on 9 September 2022. It was the first production released under the Star Studios name following the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney. The film received mixed reviews with praise for the performances, direction, visual effects, soundtrack, musical score and action sequences while criticism was directed towards the dialogue. It became the highest-grossing Hindi film of 2022 and fifth highest-grossing Indian film of 2022. Two sequels are being developed simultaneously and are slated to be released in December 2026 and December 2027 respectively.","content":"#Plot\n#Cast\n#Production\n##Development\n##Pre-production\n##Themes\n##Characters\n##Filming\n##Post-production\n#Music\n#Marketing\n#Release\n##Theatrical\n##Controversy\n##Home media\n#Reception\n##Critical response\n###India\n###International\n##Box office\n#Accolades\n#Future\n##Sequel\n##Streaming television series\n##Spin-off\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Jerry_Lee_Lewis","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jerry_Lee_Lewis","summary":"Jerry Lee Lewis (September 29, 1935 – October 28, 2022) was an American pianist, singer and songwriter. Nicknamed \"The Killer\", he was described as \"rock 'n' roll's first great wild man\". A pioneer of rock and roll and rockabilly music, Lewis made his first recordings in 1952 at Cosimo Matassa's J&M Studio in New Orleans, Louisiana, and early recordings in 1956 at Sun Records in Memphis, Tennessee. \"Crazy Arms\" sold 300,000 copies in the Southern United States, but it was his 1957 hit \"Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On\" that shot Lewis to worldwide fame. He followed this with the major hits \"Great Balls of Fire\", \"Breathless\", and \"High School Confidential\".\nHis rock and roll career faltered in the wake of his marriage to Myra Gale Brown, his 13-year-old first cousin once removed. His popularity quickly eroded following the scandal, and with few exceptions, such as a cover of Ray Charles's \"What'd I Say\", he did not have much chart success in the early 1960s. His live performances at this time were increasingly wild and energetic. His 1964 live album Live at the Star Club, Hamburg is regarded by many music journalists and fans as one of the wildest and greatest live rock albums ever. In 1968, Lewis made a transition into country music and had hits with songs such as \"Another Place, Another Time\". This reignited his career, and throughout the late 1960s and 1970s, he regularly topped the country-western charts; throughout his seven-decade career, Lewis had 30 songs reach the Top 10 on the Billboard Country and Western Chart. His No. 1 country hits included \"To Make Love Sweeter for You\", \"There Must Be More to Love Than This\", \"Would You Take Another Chance on Me\", and \"Me and Bobby McGee\".\nLewis's successes continued throughout the decades, and he embraced his rock and roll past with songs such as a cover of The Big Bopper's \"Chantilly Lace\" and Mack Vickery's \"Rockin' My Life Away\". In the 21st century, Lewis continued to tour worldwide and released new albums. His 2006 album Last Man Standing was his best-selling release, with over a million copies worldwide. This was followed by Mean Old Man in 2010, another of his bestselling albums.\nLewis had a dozen gold records in rock and country. He won four Grammy awards, including a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and two Grammy Hall of Fame Awards. Lewis was inducted into the inaugural class of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1986, and his pioneering contribution to the genre was recognized by the Rockabilly Hall of Fame. He was also a member of the inaugural class inducted into the Memphis Music Hall of Fame. He was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2022. In 1989, his life was chronicled in the movie Great Balls of Fire, starring Dennis Quaid. In 2003, Rolling Stone listed his box set All Killer, No Filler: The Anthology at number 242 on their list of \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". In 2004, they ranked him No. 24 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. Lewis was the last surviving member of Sun Records' Million Dollar Quartet and the album Class of '55, which also included Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins, Roy Orbison, and Elvis Presley.\nMusic critic Robert Christgau said of Lewis: \"His drive, his timing, his offhand vocal power, his unmistakable boogie-plus piano, and his absolute confidence in the face of the void make Jerry Lee the quintessential rock and roller.\"","content":"#Early life\n#Career\n##J&M Studio\n##Sun Records\n##Marriage controversy\n##Smash Records\n##Live at the Star Club, Hamburg\n##Country comeback\n##Grand Ole Opry appearance\n##The Session and Southern Roots\n##Later career\n#Music legacy\n##Accolades\n##Piano style\n#Personal life\n##Relationships and children\n##Religious beliefs\n##Graceland arrest\n##Debt\n##Health and death\n#Selected discography\n##Compositions\n#References\n##Sources cited\n#Further reading\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

Walsh said he made the film in opposition to \"gender ideology\". It is described in many sources as anti-trans or transphobic. The film was released to subscribers of The Daily Wire on June 1, 2022, coinciding with the start of Pride Month.\nThe film received mixed reviews. Walsh's approach garnered praise from conservative commentators, while drawing criticism from other sources, including advocates of transgender healthcare. According to transgender activists and others who starred in the film, Walsh had invited individuals to participate in the film under false pretenses. Walsh's tour to showcase the film at college campuses sparked protests. In June 2023, during the subsequent Pride Month, the film gained further attention when Elon Musk promoted it on Twitter.","content":"#Summary\n#Production\n#Release\n#Reception\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

The conflicts spanned nearly 70 years and was fought between British and French forces, supported by their colonial militias, and various First Nations.\nIn 1760, the British conquered New France, and its civilians, whom they hoped to assimilate, were subsequently declared British subjects. After the Quebec Act of 1774, Canadians received their first charter of rights under the new regime, resulting in the northern colonies abstention from joining the American Revolutionary War and loyalty to British Crown. The US invaded in 1775 and again from 1812 to 1814 but were rebuffed each time. The threat of US invasion persisted into the 19th century, partially facilitating Canadian Confederation in 1867. \nIn 1871, the British Army withdrew from Canada, ceding defence responsibilities to the Canadian militia. In subsequent decades, the militia underwent changes that transformed it into a professional force. As a British dominion, Canada participated in the Second Boer War and the First World War. In 1939, Canada issued its first declaration of war, joining the Second World War in support of the UK and the Allies. Since then, Canada has shown support for multilateralism and internationalism through its peacekeeping efforts and participation in multinational coalitions, including the Korean War, the Gulf War, the Kosovo War, and the Afghan war.","content":"#Warfare pre-contact\n##European contact\n#17th century\n##Beaver Wars\n###1609–1667\n###1668–1701\n##Early British-French colonial hostilities\n###Acadian Civil War and its subsequent seizure\n##Anglo-Dutch Wars\n##Nine Years' War\n###English-maritime Algonquians conflict\n#18th century\n##War of Spanish Succession\n##Father Rale's War\n##Fox Wars\n##War of Austrian Succession\n##Father Le Loutre's War\n##Seven Years' War\n###Early French success and Acadia\n###British conquest of New France\n##Pontiac's War\n##American Revolutionary War\n###Quebec and Nova Scotia\n###Consequences\n##French Revolutionary Wars\n#19th century\n##War of 1812\n###1813\n###1814\n##Pemmican War\n##British forces in Canada in the mid–19th century\n###Local levies and recruitment\n##Rebellions of 1837–1838\n##Conflicts during the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush\n##American Civil War\n##Fenian raids\n##British forces in Canada in the late–19th century\n###Canadian enlistment in British forces after 1871\n##Canadian militia in the late–19th century\n##Nile Expedition\n##Late–19th century conflicts in western Canada\n###Riel Rebellions\n#20th century\n##Boer War\n##Early 20th century military developments\n###Creation of a Canadian navy\n##First World War\n###Canadian Expeditionary Force\n###Air and sea operations\n###Conscription\n###Commemoration\n##Interwar period\n###Intervention in Russia\n###Establishing an air force\n###Spanish Civil War\n##Second World War\n###Canadian Army operations\n###Naval operations\n###Air operations\n###Industry and research\n##Cold War\n###Korean War\n###Forces in Europe\n###Unification of Canada's military\n###October Crisis\n###Vietnam War\n##Post-Cold War\n###Oka Crisis\n###Gulf War\n###Somali Civil War\n###Yugoslav Wars\n#21st century\n##War in Afghanistan\n##Libyan Civil War\n##Mali War\n##War against the Islamic State\n#Peacekeeping efforts\n#See also\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

An appeal to a Full Court of the Federal Court, comprising three judges, commenced on 5 February 2024.\nRoberts-Smith was awarded a Medal for Gallantry in 2006, the Victoria Cross for Australia in 2011, and a Commendation for Distinguished Service in 2012. After discharge from the Australian Army in 2013, he was granted a scholarship to study business at the University of Queensland. In 2015, he was appointed deputy general manager of the regional television network Seven Queensland and later, general manager of Seven Brisbane until temporarily stepping down in 2021 to focus on his defamation action against Nine Entertainment. Following the defamation outcome in 2023, Roberts-Smith resigned from Seven West Media.\nIn 2017, Roberts-Smith's actions in Afghanistan came under scrutiny in light of an independent war crimes inquiry into \"questions of unlawful conduct concerning (Australia's) Special Operations Task Group in Afghanistan\". In November 2018, the Australian Federal Police launched an investigation into Roberts-Smith over allegations he committed war crimes in Afghanistan.\nWith assistance from a legal team hired by Seven Network owner Kerry Stokes, Roberts-Smith commenced defamation proceedings in August 2018 against Nine Entertainment publications The Age, The Sydney Morning Herald, and against The Canberra Times, and also named each of the three journalists involved in reporting alleged acts of bullying and war crimes committed by him.\nThe civil trial commenced in June 2021 in the Federal Court in Sydney. The media outlets mounted a defence which required them to prove the truth of their claims based on the civil standard of proof, on the balance of probabilities, applying the Briginshaw principle. In June 2023, Justice Anthony Besanko dismissed Roberts-Smith's defamation case against the three publications, ruling that it was proven to the standard required in Australian defamation law that Roberts-Smith murdered four Afghans and had broken the rules of military engagement.","content":"#Early life and family\n#Military career\n##Military decorations\n#Corporate career\n#Other activities\n#War crime allegations\n##Investigation\n#Defamation suit\n##Judgment\n##Appeal\n#Further controversy\n#Personal life\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

The American Football Conference (AFC) champion Kansas City Chiefs defeated the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Philadelphia Eagles, 38–35. The game was played on February 12, 2023, at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. It was the fourth Super Bowl hosted by the Phoenix metropolitan area, and the third at this venue, after Super Bowls XLII in 2008 and XLIX in 2015 when it was known as University of Phoenix Stadium.\nBoth teams finished the regular season with a league-best 14–3 record.

This was the Chiefs' fifth Super Bowl appearance overall and third in the last four seasons, having previously won Super Bowls IV and LIV and lost Super Bowls I and LV.\nThe Chiefs won the game 38–35 on a game winning field goal by Harrison Butker. Butker's game-winning kick was set up by a pivotal defensive holding call on Philadelphia cornerback James Bradberry, which was criticized by some observers but supported by others, including Bradberry himself. The 73 combined points made this the third-highest scoring Super Bowl game, and the 35 points scored by the Eagles were the most by the losing team in the Super Bowl. Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes was named Super Bowl Most Valuable Player (MVP), completing 21 of 27 passes for 182 yards and three touchdowns.

The inquiry was conducted by the House's Judiciary, Oversight and Ways and Means committees. James Comer, chairman of the Oversight Committee, was named to lead the investigation.\nSpeaker McCarthy had twelve days earlier said an inquiry would require a majority House vote. He initiated the inquiry stating that recent House investigations \"paint a picture of corruption\" by Biden and his family. No congressional investigations had yet discovered any evidence of wrongdoing by Joe Biden himself. The inquiry held a public hearing on September 28, 2023.\nDespite neither the earlier Comer committee investigation nor the impeachment inquiry finding evidence of wrongdoing by the president, on December 13, 2023, majority House Republicans unanimously approved a resolution to formalize the inquiry. Democrats unanimously voted against the resolution. Lacking evidence and Republican appetite to proceed to impeachment hearings with their thin House majority, by March 2024 the impeachment inquiry was winding down. The three investigating committees released a nearly 300-page report on August 19, 2024, alleging \"impeachable conduct\" but did not recommend specific articles of impeachment, focusing primarily on the activities of Hunter Biden and his associates, and the president's brother, Jim Biden.\nOn February 15, 2024, the FBI arrested and charged Alexander Smirnov, who was the central figure in bribery allegations against Biden, for lying to investigators and fabricating an uncorroborated story to damage Biden's reelection campaign, and that \"officials associated with Russian intelligence were involved\" in manufacturing the story.","content":"#Background\n#Initiation of the inquiry\n#House committee investigations\n#Witness credibility\n##Alexander Smirnov\n#Responses\n##Republican reaction\n##Democratic reaction\n##Reaction from academics\n#Analysis\n##Legal standing\n#Opinion polling\n##Support for inquiry\n##Support for impeachment\n#Outcome\n#Notes\n","lang":"en"}

It was the sixth career World title for Edin, whose team became the first ever to win an Olympic gold and World championship in the same year. In the game, Canada got off to a strong start, leading 3–0 after two. However, Sweden came back, tying it up at three in the fourth end, when Sweden scored a deuce after Gushue's last stone hit a ridge in the ice, and moved the wrong way. Canada was forced to a single in the fifth, and Sweden scored two in the sixth after Gushue missed a double takeout attempt. In the seventh, Gushue was forced to a single despite a crowded house, tying the game at five. In the ninth, with Canada down by one, Gushue missed a blank opportunity, by nosing a Swedish rock, and forcing the team to take one point, tying the game heading into the last end, without hammer.  In the last end, with the score tied at six, Canada got off to a bad start when lead Geoff Walker hogged one of his rocks. On his final shot, Gushue missed his last draw against two Swedish stones, giving Sweden the championship. After the game, Gushue complained about the ice conditions, stating \"(it was) the worst ice I've ever curled on in a major championship\", due in part to there being four \"ridges\" on the ice.

The film presents a fictional storyline centred around the 1990 exodus of Kashmiri Hindus from Indian-administered Kashmir. It depicts the exodus and the events leading up to it as a genocide, a framing considered inaccurate by scholars. The film claims that such facts were suppressed by a conspiracy of silence.\nThe Kashmir Files stars Mithun Chakraborty, Anupam Kher, Darshan Kumar, and Pallavi Joshi. The plot follows a Kashmiri Hindu college student, raised by his exiled grandfather and shielded from the knowledge of the circumstances of the death of his parents. After his grandfather's death, the student, who had come to believe at college that the exodus was benign, becomes driven to uncover the facts of his family's deaths. The plot alternates between the student's quest in the present time, 2020, and his family's travails of thirty years before. The film was released in theatres on 11 March 2022. It has been a commercial success.\nThe Kashmir Files received mixed reviews upon release, with praise directed to its  cinematography and the performances of the ensemble cast; however its storyline attracted criticism for attempting to recast established history and propagating Islamophobia. Supporters have praised the film for showing what they say is an overlooked aspect of Kashmir's history. Made on a production budget of approximately ₹15 crore (US$1.8 million) to ₹25 crore (US$3.0 million) the film grossed ₹340.92 crore (US$41 million) worldwide, becoming the third highest-grossing Hindi film of 2022.\nAt the 69th National Film Awards, The Kashmir Files won 2 awards – Best Feature Film on National Integration and Best Supporting Actress (Joshi).

A violent high-end EF4 tornado moved through the towns of Rolling Fork, Midnight, and Silver City in western Mississippi, causing catastrophic damage and many fatalities. Multiple tornado emergencies were issued for that tornado and two subsequent EF3 tornadoes from the same supercell that struck Winona and Amory.\nSevere weather and tornadic activity continued into the early morning hours of March 25, as a squall line of severe storms with embedded circulations moved eastward across Tennessee and Alabama. A low-end EF2 tornado within the line killed a person in the northern part of Hartselle, Alabama. The slow-moving storm system then stalled the following day, producing more severe weather and tornadoes across portions of Alabama and Georgia from March 26 to March 27, including a couple of strong tornadoes. The outbreak also resulted in numerous reports of damaging straight-line winds, hail, and flooding.","content":"#Meteorological synopsis\n##March 24–25\n##March 26–27\n#Confirmed tornadoes\n##March 24 event\n##March 25 event\n##March 26 event\n##March 27 event\n##Rolling Fork–Midnight–Silver City, Mississippi\n##Black Hawk–Winona, Mississippi\n##Egypt–New Wren–Amory–Smithville, Mississippi\n##North West Point–Smiths Mill–Pine Mountain, Georgia\n#Non-tornadic effects\n#Aftermath\n##Political response\n##Mississippi\n###Rolling Fork\n###Amory\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}
{"title":"2022_Swedish_general_election","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2022_Swedish_general_election","summary":"General elections were held in Sweden on 11 September 2022 to elect the 349 members of the Riksdag who in turn elected the Prime Minister of Sweden. Under the constitution, regional and municipal elections were also held on the same day. The preliminary results presented on 15 September showed the government parties lost their majority, which were confirmed by the final results published on 17 September. After a month of negotiations following the elections that led to the Tidö Agreement among the right-wing bloc, Moderate Party (M) leader Ulf Kristersson was elected prime minister on 17 October. The Kristersson cabinet is a minority government of the Moderates, Christian Democrats (KD) and Liberals (L) that relies on confidence and supply from the Sweden Democrats (SD).\nThe campaign period was met with issues regarding the accession of Sweden to NATO due to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, as well as crime, energy, the economy, and immigration. Parliamentary parties campaigned through July and August, while in late August SD surpassed M in opinion polls. Exit polls showed that S and its confidence-and-supply parties Left Party, Centre Party and Green Party had a narrow lead against the right-leaning bloc (SD, M, KD, L). During the counting of the preliminary results and later on, Sweden's Election Authority said that the right overtook the left (S, V, C, MP) by three seats. Andersson conceded the election three days later, and resigned the day after that.\nThe election saw massive swings between the two blocs in different regions. The left-leaning bloc won the most votes in large cities and several university towns with unprecedented massive margins. Stockholm city went red by 18 points, Gothenburg by 11 points and the left also flipped two suburban municipalities in Stockholm County. Meanwhile, the right managed to overturn dozens of municipalities that had historically been dominated by S, especially in the central interior Bergslagen region. In this historically industrial area, the county of Dalarna was won by the right-leaning coalition for the first time in history, while the left held on by just 373 votes in Värmland. Likewise, some municipalities that the outright leftist parties (S, V, MP) had won with an overall majority of 50 points in the 1994 Swedish general election, flipped to the right. In middle Sweden, the right won Eskilstuna, Gävle, Norrköping, Södertälje and Västerås. All five had been historical leftist strongholds.\nMajor gains in minority were also made by the right-leaning bloc in Northern Sweden, leading the vote in eight municipalities compared to none four years prior. In the lower east, the historically leftist swing counties Kalmar, Södermanland, Västmanland and Östergötland all went to the right to seal the parliamentary majority. S won 30% of the popular vote, with a net increase in spite of the election loss. SD became the second-largest party with above 20% of the popular vote, surpassing M at 19%. The blocs were separated by a thin margin of about half a percentage point. The parties aligned with the outgoing government did somewhat better in the regional and municipal elections.","content":"#Background\n##Löfven's government\n##Andersson's government\n#Electoral system\n##Political parties\n##Pre-election composition\n#Campaign\n##Issues\n##Party campaigns\n##Slogans\n##Debates\n#Opinion polls\n#Results\n##By bloc\n##Voter demographics\n##By constituency\n##Seat distribution\n##Maps\n#Aftermath\n##Government formation\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

This provided the setting for Germanization of the bureaucratic elite, introducing the governing methods of enlightened absolutism and colonialism.\nHabsburg rule over Oltenia only lasted two decades, which fit within the reign of just one Austrian Emperor (and titular \"Prince of Cisalutanian Wallachia\"), Charles VI (1711–1740). Its steady encroachment on the privileges of native boyars, as well as its added pressures on the serfs and the free peasants, were highly unpopular, undermining Austrophile positions in Wallachia as a whole. The period witnessed collective tax resistance and internal migration, in an effort to conceal the total number and location of contributors. Charles VI and the Serbian Orthodox Bishops in Belgrade took charge of the Wallachian Diocese of Râmnic, curbing its traditional privileges while allowing it to maintain cultural autonomy. Some timid steps were taken toward Catholicizing Oltenia, with Catholic Bulgarians as the main proxies. Despite being pressured from above, Râmnic Bishops were able to expand their influence into southern Transylvania, providing it with support against the spread of Greek Catholicism.\nPopular resistance required a steady adaptation of the administrative apparatus, which included more accurate censuses, relief of some feudal obligations, and heavy penalties for tax offenders. The process was directly supervised by Austrian officials, including Franz Paul von Wallis in the 1730s. It was cut short by an unexpected Ottoman reconquest in late 1737, which brought another devastation of Oltenia, but also witnessed the reestablishment of self-rule by the Romanians. \"Imperial Wallachia\" formally ended in 1739, when the Ottoman Empire recovered Serbia and Oltenia (which was returned to Wallachia) after the Treaty of Belgrade. \nThe claim to Oltenia was formally revived during the 1770s by Joseph II, but died out a decade later. The Banat of Temeswar, which became home to a sizable community of Romanian Oltenian and Bulgarian refugees, was kept by the Habsburg monarchy and its successors until 1918. Though rejected by the mass of the people, the Habsburg experiment in Oltenia produced some lasting changes, with some institutions maintained in place by Wallachian Prince Constantine Mavrocordatos. Austrian influence, which introduced the region to organized guilds and a postal system, also provided Wallachians with a linguistic template for modernization and re-Latinization.","content":"#History\n##Austrian conquest\n##Government creation\n##Boyar and peasant resistance\n##Austrian consolidation\n##Ottoman reconquest\n#Legacy\n##\"Colonial\" precedent\n##Cultural survivals\n#Symbols\n#Notes\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"2022_Malaysian_general_election","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2022_Malaysian_general_election","summary":"General elections were held in Malaysia on Saturday, 19 November 2022. The prospect of snap elections had been considered high due to the political crisis that had been ongoing since 2020; political instability caused by coalition or party switching among members of Parliament, combined with the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic, contributed to the resignation of two prime ministers and the collapse of each of their respective coalition governments since the 2018 general elections.\nThe term of the 14th Parliament was due to expire on 16 July 2023, five years after its first meeting on 16 July 2018. However, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong (King of Malaysia), Abdullah of Pahang, dissolved parliament at the request of Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob on 10 October 2022. Constitutionally, the elections were required to be held within 60 days of the dissolution, making 9 December the last possible polling day.\nHistorically, general elections for all state legislative assemblies of Malaysia except Sarawak had been held concurrently as a cost-saving measure. However, the states could dissolve their own legislatures independently from Parliament, and several states (Sabah, Malacca and Johor) had held early elections due to the political instability, disrupting their usual electoral cycle. The governments of these states and Sarawak indicated that they would not be holding state elections concurrently. The governments of several other states, primarily those under a Pakatan Harapan or Perikatan Nasional government, stated that they would prefer to complete a full term. By 19 October, all Pakatan-led states, Penang, Selangor and Negeri Sembilan, as well as Perikatan-led states, Kedah, Kelantan and Terengganu, already confirmed not to be dissolving their state legislatures.\nThe elections were the first in which 18–20-year-olds were eligible to vote, following a constitutional amendment reducing the voting age from 21 to 18. Additionally, all voters were automatically registered, so the electorate expanded by around six million people or 31%.\nResults for 220 out of all 222 contested seats in the Dewan Rakyat were announced by the morning of 20 November 2022, although polling in the constituency of Padang Serai was postponed until 7 December due to the death of the Pakatan Harapan candidate, Karuppaiya Muthusamy, three days before the elections. Voting in Baram was suspended on polling day due to flooding and inclement weather preventing polling workers from reaching the polling stations, and was instead completed on 21 November.\nThe elections resulted in a hung parliament, the first federal election to have had such a result in the nation's history. Pakatan Harapan remained the coalition with the most seats in the Dewan Rakyat albeit with a reduced share, with its largest losses in Kedah. Perikatan Nasional swept the northwestern and east coastal states of Peninsular Malaysia in a landslide, winning every seat in the states of Perlis, Kelantan and Terengganu, and all but one in Kedah; dubbed by many people as the \"Green Wave\" (Malay: \"Gelombang Hijau\"). The historically dominant Barisan Nasional fell to third place, having lost most of its seats to Perikatan Nasional. A number of well-known incumbent MPs also lost their seats, including former prime minister Mahathir Mohamad in Langkawi (who also lost his deposit), former Finance Minister Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah by a razor thin margin in Gua Musang (results unconfirmed due to petition ongoing) , Trade Minister and former Selangor's Menteri Besar (the state's head of government) Azmin Ali in Gombak, former Housing Minister Zuraida Kamaruddin in Ampang, former Domestic Trade Minister Saifuddin Nasution Ismail in Kulim-Bandar Baharu, as well as the children of Anwar Ibrahim and Mahathir Mohamad respectively, Nurul Izzah Anwar and Mukhriz Mahathir. Both former Ministers of Federal Territories, from BN and PH, Tengku Adnan Tengku Mansor and Khalid Abdul Samad were defeated, in Putrajaya and Titiwangsa respectively. Incumbent Finance Minister and Senator Tengku Zafrul Aziz failed to win a seat in the Dewan Rakyat for Kuala Selangor by a slim majority, as well as the son-in-law of Abdullah Ahmad Badawi who is also the Health Minister Khairy Jamaluddin also failed to defeat the Pakatan Harapan candidate by a slim majority too in Sungai Buloh.\nAfter obtaining support from Barisan Nasional, Gabungan Parti Sarawak, the Heritage Party, Malaysian United Democratic Alliance, Parti Bangsa Malaysia and independent MPs, Pakatan Harapan chairman Anwar Ibrahim was appointed and sworn in as prime minister on 24 November 2022 by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong. Gabungan Rakyat Sabah also expressed support for Anwar, while Perikatan Nasional opted to become the official opposition.","content":"#Background\n##Previous election\n##Significant events\n##2020–22 political crisis\n#Electoral system\n#Timeline\n##Dissolution of parliament\n##Dissolution of state legislatures\n##Pre-nomination events\n##Timetable\n#Last election pendulum\n#Political parties and candidates\n##Parties represented in current legislatures\n##Extra-parliamentary parties\n##Nominated candidates\n#Campaign\n##Timing of election\n##Youth vote\n#Outgoing members of parliament\n#Opinion polls\n#Results\n##By alliance\n##By parliamentary seats\n##State assemblies\n##Seats that changed allegiance\n#Aftermath\n##Formation of federal government\n##International reactions\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

It was the first FIFA Women's World Cup with more than one host nation, as well as the first World Cup to be held across multiple confederations, as Australia is in the Asian confederation, while New Zealand is in the Oceanian confederation. It was also the first Women's World Cup to be held in the Southern Hemisphere. \nThis tournament was the first to feature an expanded format of 32 teams from the previous 24, replicating the format used for the men's World Cup from 1998 to 2022. The opening match was won by co-host New Zealand, beating Norway at Eden Park in Auckland on 20 July 2023 and achieving their first Women's World Cup victory. \nSpain were crowned champions after defeating reigning European champions England 1–0 in the final. It was the first time a European nation had won the Women's World Cup since 2007 and Spain's first title, although their victory was marred by the Rubiales affair. Spain became the second nation to win both the women's and men's World Cup since Germany in the 2003 edition. In addition, they became the first nation to concurrently hold the FIFA women's U-17, U-20, and senior World Cups. Sweden would claim their fourth bronze medal at the Women's World Cup while co-host Australia achieved their best placing yet, finishing fourth. Japanese player Hinata Miyazawa won the Golden Boot scoring five goals throughout the tournament. Spanish player Aitana Bonmatí was voted the tournament's best player, winning the Golden Ball, whilst Bonmatí's teammate Salma Paralluelo was awarded the Young Player Award. England goalkeeper Mary Earps won the Golden Glove, awarded to the best-performing goalkeeper of the tournament.\nOf the eight teams making their first appearance, Morocco were the only one to advance to the round of 16 (where they lost to France; coincidentally, the result of this fixture was similar to the men's World Cup in Qatar, where France defeated Morocco in the semi-final). The United States were the two-time defending champions, but were eliminated in the round of 16 by Sweden, the first time the team had not made the semi-finals at the tournament, and the first time the defending champions failed to progress to the quarter-finals.\nAustralia's team, nicknamed the Matildas, performed better than expected, and the event saw many Australians unite to support them. The Matildas, who beat France to make the semi-finals for the first time, saw record numbers of fans watching their games, their 3–1 loss to England becoming the most watched television broadcast in Australian history, with an average viewership of 7.13 million and a peak viewership of 11.15 million viewers.\nIt was the most attended edition of the competition ever held.","content":"#Overview\n##Schedule\n##Prize money\n#Host selection\n#Format\n#Venues\n#Teams\n##Qualification\n##Squads\n##Draw\n#Officiating\n#Ceremonies\n##Opening ceremonies\n##Closing ceremonies\n#Impact\n#Group stage\n##Group A\n##Group B\n##Group C\n##Group D\n##Group E\n##Group F\n##Group G\n##Group H\n#Knockout stage\n##Bracket\n##Round of 16\n##Quarter-finals\n##Semi-finals\n##Third-place match\n##Final\n#Awards\n#Statistics\n##Goalscorers\n##Assists\n##Discipline\n#Marketing\n##Branding\n##Ticketing\n##Merchandise\n##Broadcasting rights\n##Sponsorship\n#Symbols\n##Mascot\n##Match ball\n##Music\n#Progressive actions\n##Indigenous flags and names\n##Player advocacy\n###Climate action\n###Germany grassroots\n##UN Women partnership\n#Issues\n##Controversies\n##Auckland shootings\n##Pullman hotel fire\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

It was his record-extending 14th and final French Open title and record-extending 22nd and final major title overall. It marked the first time in his career that he won the Australian Open and the French Open in the same calendar year. Nadal also became the third man to defeat four top 10 players en route to a major title since the introduction of ATP rankings in 1973 (after Mats Wilander at the 1982 French Open and Roger Federer at the 2017 Australian Open). Ruud became the first Norwegian man to reach a major quarterfinal and beyond (surpassing his father Christian), and the first Scandinavian man to do so since Robin Söderling in 2010.\nNovak Djokovic was the defending champion, but lost in the quarterfinals to Nadal. Djokovic was attempting to equal Nadal's all-time record of 21 men's singles major titles and become the first man in history to achieve the triple career Grand Slam. Their quarterfinal match was their record-extending 59th encounter, and their 10th encounter at the French Open, which is an Open Era record for two players in one tournament.\nDjokovic, Daniil Medvedev and Alexander Zverev were in contention for the ATP No. 1 singles ranking. Following Djokovic's quarterfinal loss and Zverev's semifinal retirement, Djokovic retained the No. 1 ranking at the end of the tournament. One week later, on 13 June 2022, when points from the previous year's tournament were dropped, Medvedev reclaimed the top ranking, while Zverev reached into the new career high ranking of world No. 2, ending the Big Three's streak in the top 2 spots since 10 November 2003. Additionally, as Roger Federer did not enter the tournament, he fell outside of the top 50 in the ATP rankings for the first time since 5 June 2000.\nStefanos Tsitsipas' fourth-round loss guaranteed a first-time French Open finalist from the bottom half of the draw, with Ruud emerging as that finalist. Holger Rune became the first Danish man to reach a major singles quarterfinal in the Open Era.\nThis was the first edition of the French Open to feature a tiebreak (10-point) in the fifth set when the match reached 6 games all. Camilo Ugo Carabelli and Aslan Karatsev became the first players to contest this tiebreak in the main draw in their first-round match. This tournament marked the first time since the 2002 Australian Open that Feliciano López failed to qualify for the main draw of a major, ending his record streak of 79 consecutive major appearances. It was also the last Grand Slam appearance for former world No. 6 Gilles Simon, losing in the 3rd round and final professional tournament for former world No. 5 and 2008 Australian Open runner-up Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, who lost in the 1st round to Ruud.","content":"#Seeds\n#Draw\n##Key\n##Finals\n##Top half\n###Section 1\n###Section 2\n###Section 3\n###Section 4\n##Bottom half\n###Section 5\n###Section 6\n###Section 7\n###Section 8\n#Seeded players\n##Withdrawn players\n#Other entry information\n##Wild cards\n##Protected ranking\n##Qualifiers\n##Lucky losers\n##Withdrawals\n#Explanatory notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

It was the 24th edition of the Winter Olympic Games.\nBeijing was selected as host city on 31 July 2015 at the 128th IOC Session in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, marking its second time hosting the Olympics, and the last of three consecutive Olympics hosted in East Asia following the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang County, South Korea, and the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan. Having previously hosted the 2008 Summer Olympics, Beijing became the first city to have hosted both the Summer and Winter Olympics. The venues for the Games were concentrated around Beijing, its suburb Yanqing District, and Zhangjiakou, with some events (including the ceremonies and curling) repurposing venues originally built for Beijing 2008 (such as Beijing National Stadium and the Beijing National Aquatics Centre).\nThe Games featured a record 109 events across 15 disciplines, with big air freestyle skiing and women's monobob making their Olympic debuts as medal events, as well as several new mixed competitions. A total of 2,871 athletes representing 91 teams competed in the Games, with Haiti and Saudi Arabia making their Winter Olympic debut.\nBeijing's hosting of the Games was subject to various concerns and controversies including those related to human rights violations in China, such as the persecution of Uyghurs in China, which led to calls for a boycott of the games. Like the Summer Olympics held six months earlier in Tokyo, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the implementation of health and safety protocols, and, for the second Games in a row, the Games being closed to the public (with selected events open to invited guests at a reduced capacity).\nNorway finished at the top of the medal table for the second successive Winter Olympics, winning a total of 37 medals, of which 16 were gold, setting a new record for the largest number of gold medals won at a single Winter Olympics.

Two two-lane vehicular spans of the bridge collapsed into the water. Two adjacent eastbound lanes on a separate structure survived. The railway bridge was also damaged by a railway tanker car that caught fire. Five people were killed. Following the incident, the Investigative Committee of Russia launched an investigation.\nThe damage reduced the transport capacity of the bridge, which is being used to supply Russian troops in Crimea during the invasion of Ukraine. The explosion occurred the day after the 70th birthday of Russian President Vladimir Putin and one week after the announcement of the annexation of four Ukrainian regions by Russia. At the time, no-one claimed responsibility for the explosion and Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that the Ukrainian government \"did not order\" it. However, in July 2023, Ukraine's Deputy Minister of Defense Hanna Maliar acknowledged Ukraine had conducted the attack \"in order to break the logistics of the Russians\". The Security Service of Ukraine confirmed that Ukraine was behind the attack.\nRussian officials and a \"senior Ukrainian official\" speaking to The New York Times stated the explosion was from a bomb loaded onto a truck. The BBC said it was more likely to have been caused by a maritime drone. The Russian Federal Security Service detained five Russian citizens and three people from Ukraine and Armenia, who were accused of organising the attack. In August 2023, Vasyl Malyuk, head of the Security Service of Ukraine, gave an interview to The New Voice of Ukraine in which he detailed how a truck carrying explosives was used to cause the explosion.","content":"#Background\n#Event\n#Immediate impact\n#Structural damage to the bridges\n#Reaction\n##Ukrainian\n##Russian\n##International\n#Aftermath\n##Effect on Russian forces\n##Effect on Russian government\n#Investigation\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

She was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Portsmouth North from 2010 to 2024. She ran twice for the Conservative party leadership in July–September and October 2022, losing to Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak respectively. In the 2024 general election, Mordaunt lost her Portsmouth North seat to Labour's Amanda Martin.\nMordaunt read philosophy at the University of Reading, before working in the public relations industry. She held roles under Conservative Party leaders John Major and William Hague, and also worked for George W. Bush's presidential campaigns in 2000 and 2004. Mordaunt was elected to the House of Commons at the 2010 general election. Under the coalition government of David Cameron, she served as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Decentralisation from 2014 to 2015. After the 2015 general election, Cameron promoted her to Minister of State for the Armed Forces, the first woman to hold the post. Mordaunt supported Brexit in the 2016 referendum on EU membership. Following Theresa May's appointment as prime minister, Mordaunt was appointed Minister of State for Disabled People, Work and Health. In 2017, following the resignation of Priti Patel, she was appointed Secretary of State for International Development. She also served as Minister for Women and Equalities from 2018 to 2019.\nIn May 2019, Mordaunt was appointed to the Cabinet position of Secretary of State for Defence, replacing Gavin Williamson, becoming the first woman to hold the post. She served as Defence Secretary for 85 days before returning to the backbenches, having been removed from office by the new prime minister Boris Johnson. In the February 2020 reshuffle, she re-entered government as Paymaster General. In the 2021 reshuffle, she was appointed Minister of State for Trade Policy.\nFollowing Johnson's announcement in July 2022 that he would resign as Leader of the Conservative Party and prime minister, Mordaunt entered the leadership contest to succeed him, but was eliminated in the final round of voting among Conservative MPs and subsequently endorsed Truss. Mordaunt was appointed as Leader of the House of Commons and Lord President of the Council when Truss became prime minister. Following Truss's resignation on 20 October 2022, Mordaunt made a second bid to become Conservative leader and prime minister.

Sunak later retained Mordaunt in his cabinet, continuing as Leader of the House of Commons and Lord President, giving her a notable role at the coronation of Charles III and Camilla.

{"title":"Municipal_history_of_Quebec","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Municipal_history_of_Quebec","summary":"The municipal history of Quebec started in 1796 with the creation of administrations for Montréal and Quebec City, but it really developed immediately prior to the creation of the Province of Canada in 1841 with the formation of municipal districts, followed in March 1845 when the Parliament of the Province of Canada adopted an Act to create local authorities in Lower Canada which took effect in July 1845.\nThe structure was abolished and replaced in September 1847 by a system of county municipalities, whose councillors were elected from the parishes and townships existing therein, with provision for the creation of towns and villages that would be separated from their counties. Further reform came into effect in July 1855 for all parts of Lower Canada other than Montreal, Quebec City and Saint-Hyacinthe, which included provision for the creation of local councils for parishes and townships, the representation of towns and villages on county councils, and the formation of towns and villages by order in council upon the recommendation of the relevant county council. The municipal law of Lower Canada was consolidated into a single Act in 1860.\nFor more than a century localities changed little. The major modifications were from the colonization of new territories. Until 2002 and 2006, there were no major reorganizations in the municipal history of Quebec, with the notable exceptions of Montréal (1910), Laval (1965), Bécancour (1965) Gaspé (1971), Mirabel (1971), Percé (1971), Buckingham (1975), Gatineau (1975), La Pêche (1975), Beauport (1976), La Malbaie (1999), Mont-Tremblant (2000), Chandler (2001), Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu (2001) and Saint-Hyacinthe (2001).\nMunicipalities written in bold are on their current form.","content":"#1599 to 1793\n##1599\n##1608\n##1634\n##1642\n##1793\n#19th century\n##1802\n##1832\n##1841\n##1845\n##1846\n##1847\n##1848\n##1849\n##1850\n##1852\n##1853\n##1854\n##1855\n##1856\n##1857\n##1858\n##1859\n##1860\n##1861\n##1862\n##1863\n##1864\n##1865\n##1866\n##1867\n##1868\n##1869\n##1870\n##1871\n##1872\n##1873\n##1874\n##1875\n##1876\n##1877\n##1878\n##1879\n##1880\n##1881\n##1882\n##1883\n##1884\n##1885\n##1886\n##1887\n##1888\n##1889\n##1890\n##1891\n##1892\n##1893\n##1894\n##1895\n##1896\n##1897\n##1898\n##1899\n#20th century\n##1900\n##1901\n##1902\n##1903\n##1904\n##1905\n##1906\n##1907\n##1908\n##1909\n##1910\n##1911\n##1912\n##1913\n##1914\n##1915\n##1916\n##1917\n##1918\n##1919\n##1920\n##1921\n##1922\n##1923\n##1924\n##1925\n##1926\n##1927\n##1928\n##1929\n##1930\n##1931\n##1932\n##1933\n##1934\n##1935\n##1936\n##1937\n##1938\n##1939\n##1940\n##1941\n##1942\n##1943\n##1944\n##1945\n##1946\n##1947\n##1948\n##1949\n##1950\n##1951\n##1952\n##1953\n##1954\n##1955\n##1956\n##1957\n##1958\n##1959\n##1960\n##1961\n##1962\n##1963\n##1964\n##1965\n##1966\n##1967\n##1968\n##1969\n##1970\n##1971\n##1972\n##1973\n##1974\n##1975\n##1976\n##1977\n##1978\n##1979\n##1980\n##1981\n##1982\n##1983\n##1984\n##1985\n##1986\n##1987\n##1988\n##1989\n##1990\n##1991\n##1992\n##1993\n##1994\n##1995\n##1996\n##1997\n##1998\n##1999\n#21st century\n##2000\n##2001\n##2002\n##2003\n##2004\n##2005\n##2006\n##2007\n##2008\n##2009\n##2010\n##2011\n##2012\n##2013\n##2014\n##2015\n##2016\n##2017\n##2018\n##2019\n##2020\n##2021\n##2022\n##2023\n##2024\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

Russia later filed an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) against the WADA decision. The Court of Arbitration for Sport, on review of Russia's appeal of its case from WADA, ruled on 17 December 2020 to reduce the penalty that WADA had placed. Instead of banning Russia from sporting events, the ruling allowed Russia to participate at the Olympics and other international events, but for a period of two years, the team cannot use the Russian name, flag, or anthem and must present themselves as \"Neutral Athlete\" or \"Neutral Team\". The ruling does allow for team uniforms to display \"Russia\" on the uniform as well as the use of the Russian flag colors within the uniform's design, although the name should be up to equal predominance as the \"Neutral Athlete\/Team\" designation. Russia could appeal the decision.\nOn 19 February 2021, it was announced that Russia would compete under the acronym \"ROC\", after the name of the Russian Olympic Committee. On aftermatch, the IOC announced that the Russian national flag would be substituted by the flag of the Russian Olympic Committee. It would also be allowed to use team uniforms bearing the words \"Russian Olympic Committee\", or the acronym \"ROC\" would be added.\nOn 15 April 2021, the uniforms for the Russian Olympic Committee athletes were unveiled, featuring the colours of the Russian flag. On 22 April 2021, the replacement for Russia's anthem was approved by the IOC, after an earlier choice of the patriotic Russian song \"Katyusha\" was rejected. A fragment of Pyotr Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1 is used.\nTriple gold medalist and eight-time medalist Alexander Bolshunov was the closing ceremony flagbearer.\nOn 19 February, Russian athletes officially set a new record for the total number of medals won, having earned at least 32 and improving on Russia's previous best result in Sochi (30 medals) and USSR's result in Calgary (29 medals). However, in the gold medal count the team finished only ninth with five gold medals.","content":"#Competitors\n#Medalists\n#Alpine skiing\n#Biathlon\n#Bobsleigh\n#Cross-country skiing\n#Curling\n##Men's tournament\n##Women's tournament\n#Figure skating\n#Freestyle skiing\n#Ice hockey\n##Men's tournament\n##Women's tournament\n#Luge\n#Nordic combined\n#Short track speed skating\n#Skeleton\n#Ski jumping\n#Snowboarding\n#Speed skating\n#See also\n#Notes\n","lang":"en"}

The playoffs began on May 2, 2022, one day after the regular season ended, and concluded on June 26, 2022, with the Colorado Avalanche winning their third Stanley Cup in franchise history, defeating the Tampa Bay Lightning four games to two in the Stanley Cup Finals.\nWith the Government of Canada allowing cross-border travel for fully vaccinated players and team personnel between Canada and the United States, the league was able to return to its usual two conference, four division alignment. As a result, the standard 16-team playoff format that was used before the COVID-19 pandemic from 2014–2019 was reinstated.\nThe Florida Panthers made the playoffs as the Presidents' Trophy winners with the most points (i.e. best record) during the regular season. This was the final season of the Pittsburgh Penguins' 16-season playoff streak, the longest active streak in the four major North American professional sports leagues at the time. Three of the semifinalists from the previous season (the Montreal Canadiens, New York Islanders and Vegas Golden Knights) failed to qualify for the playoffs. The Los Angeles Kings ended a two-year run in which no teams from California qualified for the playoffs. All eight playoff teams from the Eastern Conference finished the season with at least 100 points, marking the first playoffs in NHL history in which all eight teams in a single conference qualified with at least 100 points.\nFlorida's opening round series victory over the Washington Capitals was their first series win since the 1996 Eastern Conference finals. This postseason marked the third time that the league played 50 or more games in the opening round of the playoffs since this round was changed to a best-of-seven format in 1987. The first round featured five game sevens, the most in a single playoff round since 1992, when there were six game sevens in the division semifinals. On May 15, for the first time since 1997, and the second time in League history, both game sevens went into overtime. With their conference final series victory, the Tampa Bay Lightning became the third team in league history to win at least eleven consecutive playoff series; joining the Montreal Canadiens (1976–1980) and New York Islanders (1980–1984) in accomplishing this feat.","content":"#Playoff seeds\n##Eastern Conference\n###Atlantic Division\n###Metropolitan Division\n###Wild cards\n##Western Conference\n###Central Division\n###Pacific Division\n###Wild cards\n#Map of playoff teams\n#Playoff bracket\n#First round\n##Eastern Conference first round\n###(A1) Florida Panthers vs. (WC2) Washington Capitals\n###(A2) Toronto Maple Leafs vs. (A3) Tampa Bay Lightning\n###(M1) Carolina Hurricanes vs. (WC1) Boston Bruins\n###(M2) New York Rangers vs. (M3) Pittsburgh Penguins\n##Western Conference first round\n###(C1) Colorado Avalanche vs. (WC2) Nashville Predators\n###(C2) Minnesota Wild vs. (C3) St. Louis Blues\n###(P1) Calgary Flames vs. (WC1) Dallas Stars\n###(P2) Edmonton Oilers vs. (P3) Los Angeles Kings\n#Second round\n##Eastern Conference second round\n###(A1) Florida Panthers vs. (A3) Tampa Bay Lightning\n###(M1) Carolina Hurricanes vs. (M2) New York Rangers\n##Western Conference second round\n###(C1) Colorado Avalanche vs. (C3) St. Louis Blues\n###(P1) Calgary Flames vs. (P2) Edmonton Oilers\n#Conference finals\n##Eastern Conference final\n###(M2) New York Rangers vs. (A3) Tampa Bay Lightning\n##Western Conference final\n###(C1) Colorado Avalanche vs. (P2) Edmonton Oilers\n#Stanley Cup Finals\n#Player statistics\n##Skaters\n##Goaltenders\n#Media\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. The event took place on Saturday, February 18, 2023, at the Bell Centre in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. This marked the first Elimination Chamber event to be held in Canada and the second consecutive to take place outside of the United States, after the 2022 event. It also marked the first major WWE event to be held in Montreal since Breaking Point in September 2009. This also marked the first Elimination Chamber to not feature a world championship being defended inside the chamber since the 2020 edition.\nFive matches were contested at the event. In the main event, Roman Reigns defeated Sami Zayn to retain the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship. For the event's Elimination Chamber matches, there was one each for the men and women. In the men's, which was Raw-exclusive, Austin Theory retained the United States Championship, which was the first time the title was contested in the structure, while in the women's, which was the opening bout and featured wrestlers from both Raw and SmackDown, Raw's Asuka won to earn a Raw Women's Championship match at WrestleMania 39.

{"title":"Hogwarts_Legacy","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hogwarts_Legacy","summary":"Hogwarts Legacy is a 2023 action role-playing game developed by Avalanche Software and published by Warner Bros. Games under its Portkey Games label. It is part of the Wizarding World franchise, taking place a century prior to the Harry Potter novels. The player controls a student enrolled in the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry who learns to wield an array of magical abilities and objects. With the assistance of fellow students and professors, the protagonist embarks on a journey to unearth an ancient secret concealed within the wizarding world.\nFollowing their acquisition by Warner Bros. in 2017, Hogwarts Legacy marks the first release from Avalanche unrelated to Disney Interactive Studios and its products. Development commenced in 2018, while pre-release gameplay footage was leaked onto the internet in the same year. The storyline was designed to take place in a period untouched by established Wizarding World characters, offering players the opportunity to immerse themselves in their own distinct universe.\nHogwarts Legacy garnered significant anticipation upon announcement in 2020. Prior to its release, it attracted controversy due to Harry Potter creator J. K. Rowling's views on transgender people and accusations of including antisemitic tropes, leading to calls for a boycott. Following some delays, it was released on 10 February 2023 for PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X\/S, on 5 May 2023 for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, and on 14 November 2023 for Nintendo Switch. The early-access period of Hogwarts Legacy resulted in record-breaking viewership on streaming platform Twitch, making it the most-watched single-player game of all time on the platform.\nWithin two weeks, Hogwarts Legacy sold more than 12 million copies and generated $850 million in global sales revenue. As of May 5, 2023, its revenue reached $1 billion, and by the beginning of 2024, global sales totaled 24 million copies. Hogwarts Legacy received praise for its combat, world design, characters, variety of content, and faithfulness to the source material, but criticism for its lack of innovation as an open-world game and technical problems. It received various accolades, including nominations for two D.I.C.E. Awards, a Grammy Award for its soundtrack, and two BAFTA Games Awards.","content":"#Gameplay\n#Synopsis\n##Setting and characters\n##Plot\n#Development\n##Music\n##Release\n##Additional content\n#Reception\n##Critical response\n##Sales\n##Accolades\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack","summary":"On January 6, 2021, the United States Capitol Building in Washington, D.C., was attacked by a mob of supporters of then–U.S. President Donald Trump in an attempted self-coup d'état two months after his defeat in the 2020 presidential election. They sought to keep him in power by occupying the Capitol and preventing a joint session of Congress from counting the Electoral College votes to formalize the victory of President-elect Joe Biden. The attack was ultimately unsuccessful in preventing the certification of the election results. According to the bipartisan House select committee that investigated the incident, the attack was the culmination of a seven-part plan by Trump to overturn the election. Within 36 hours, six people died: one was shot by Capitol Police, another died of a drug overdose, three died of natural causes, and a police officer died after being assaulted by rioters. Many people were injured, including 174 police officers. Four officers who responded to the attack died by suicide within seven months. Damage caused by attackers exceeded $2.7 million.\nEncouraged by Trump, on January 5 and 6, thousands of his supporters gathered in Washington, D.C., to support his false claims that the 2020 election had been \"stolen by emboldened radical-left Democrats\", and to demand that then–Vice President Mike Pence and Congress reject Biden's victory. Starting at noon on January 6, at a \"Save America\" rally on the Ellipse, Trump gave a speech in which he repeated false claims of election irregularities and said, \"If you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore.\" As Congress began the electoral vote count, thousands of attendees, some armed, walked to the Capitol, with hundreds breaching police perimeters. Among the rioters were leaders of the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers militia groups, who conspired to use violence and interfere with the peaceful transfer of power.\nThe FBI estimates that between 2,000 and 2,500 people entered the Capitol Building on January 6, with some vandalizing and looting, including the offices of then-House speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Congress members. Rioters also assaulted Capitol Police officers and reporters, and attempted to capture and harm lawmakers. A gallows was erected west of the Capitol, with rioters chanting to \"Hang Mike Pence\" after he rejected requests, from Trump and others, to use authority they believed he had to overturn the election results. With building security breached, Capitol Police evacuated and locked down both chambers of Congress and several buildings in the Complex. Rioters occupied the empty Senate chamber while federal law enforcement officers defended the evacuated House floor. Pipe bombs were found at both the Democratic National Committee and Republican National Committee headquarters, and Molotov cocktails were discovered in a vehicle near the Capitol. Trump resisted sending the National Guard to quell the mob. Later that afternoon in a Twitter video, after most rioters had been cleared from the building, he restated false claims about the election and told his supporters to \"go home in peace\". The Capitol was cleared of rioters by mid-evening, and the electoral vote count was resumed and completed by the early morning of January 7. Pence declared President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris victorious. Pressured by his cabinet, the threat of removal, and many resignations, Trump later conceded to an orderly transition of power in a televised statement.\nA week after the attack, the House of Representatives impeached Trump for incitement of insurrection, making him the only U.S. president to be impeached twice. In February, after Trump had left office, the Senate voted 57–43 in favor of conviction, but fell short of the required two-thirds, resulting in his acquittal. Senate Republicans blocked a bill to create a bipartisan independent commission to investigate the attack, so the House instead approved a select investigation committee consisting of seven Democrats and two Republicans. They held nine televised public hearings on the attack, voted to subpoena Trump, and recommended that the Department of Justice (DOJ) prosecute him. On August 1, 2023, following a special counsel investigation, Trump was indicted on four charges. As of May 6, 2024, of the 1,424 people charged with federal crimes relating to the event, 820 have pleaded guilty (255 to felonies and 565 to misdemeanors), and 884 defendants have been sentenced, 541 of whom received a jail sentence. Some participants in the attack were linked to far-right extremist groups or conspiratorial movements, including the Oath Keepers, Proud Boys, and Three Percenters, some of whom were convicted of seditious conspiracy. Enrique Tarrio, then the chairman of the Proud Boys, received the longest sentence, a 22-year prison term. Trump and elected officials within the Republican Party have since promoted a revisionist history of the event by downplaying the severity of the violence, spread conspiracy theories about the attack, called those charged \"hostages\" and portrayed them as martyrs.","content":"#Background\n##Attempts to overturn the presidential election\n##Planning of January 6 events\n###Seditious conspiracy by Oath Keepers and Proud Boys\n##Predictions of violence\n##Law enforcement and National Guard preparations\n#Trump supporters gather in D.C.\n##January 5 meetings\n##Bombs placed\n##January 6 Trump rally\n###Trump's speech\n#Attack on the Capitol\n##Proud Boys march to Capitol as mob assembles\n##Bombs discovered near Capitol Complex\n##Attack begins near Peace Monument, led by Proud Boys\n##Attackers on west terrace breach Senate Wing hallway\n##Evacuation of leadership amid Capitol lockdown\n##Oath Keepers arrive and breach Rotunda\n##Ashli Babbitt killed by police while attempting to breach Speaker's Lobby\n##Attack on the Tunnel\n##Police clear the Capitol and Congress reconvenes\n#Federal officials' conduct\n##Trump's conduct\n###Inflammatory speech while knowing of weapons\n###Allegation of assaulting a Secret Service driver\n###Endangering Mike Pence\n###Failure to end the attack\n##Capitol Police leadership's failure to prepare\n##Department of Defense leadership's refusal to send Guard\n##Congressional conduct\n##Deletion of Secret Service and Homeland Security text messages\n#Participants, groups, and criminal charges\n##Proud Boys\n##Oath Keepers\n##QAnon\n##White supremacists, neo-Nazis, and neo-Confederates\n##Others\n##Police and military connections\n##Analysis\n#Results\n##Casualties and suicides\n##Damage\n##Laptop theft and cybersecurity concerns\n#Aftermath\n##Political, legal, and social repercussions\n##Domestic reactions\n##International reactions\n##14th Amendment disqualification\n##Sarbanes–Oxley Act prosecutions ruling and impact\n#Analysis and terminology\n##Historians' perspectives\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n##Federal government\n##Video\n##Timeline\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Hurricane_Ian","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hurricane_Ian","summary":"Hurricane Ian was a devastating tropical cyclone which was the third costliest weather disaster on record worldwide, the deadliest hurricane to strike the state of Florida since the 1935 Labor Day hurricane, and the strongest hurricane to make landfall in Florida since Michael in 2018. Ian caused widespread damage across western Cuba, Florida, and the Carolinas. Ian was the ninth named storm, fourth hurricane, and second major hurricane of the 2022 Atlantic hurricane season, and was the first Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic since Lorenzo in 2019.\nIan originated from a tropical wave that moved off the coast of West Africa and across the central tropical Atlantic towards the Windward Islands. The wave moved into the Caribbean Sea on September 21 bringing heavy rain and gusty winds to Trinidad and Tobago, the ABC islands, and the northern coast of South America. On the morning of September 23, the wave had enough organization to be designated as a tropical depression, after which it strengthened into Tropical Storm Ian early the next day while it was southeast of Jamaica. As Ian rapidly intensified into a Category 3 hurricane, it made landfall in western Cuba. Heavy rainfall caused widespread flooding across the area resulting in a nationwide power outage. Ian lost a minimal amount of strength while over land and soon re-strengthened while over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico. It peaked as a Category 5 hurricane with sustained winds of 160 mph (260 km\/h) early on September 28, while progressing towards the west coast of Florida, and made landfall just below peak intensity in Southwest Florida on Cayo Costa Island. In doing so, Ian tied with several other storms to become the 5th-strongest hurricane on record to make landfall in the contiguous U.S. After moving inland, Ian quickly weakened to a tropical storm before moving back offshore into the Atlantic. There it re-strengthened to become a hurricane once again before making its final landfall in South Carolina on September 30. Ian became an extratropical cyclone shortly after landfall and fully dissipated by early the next day.\nHurricane Ian caused 161 fatalities: 5 in Cuba, 150 in Florida, 5 in North Carolina, and 1 in Virginia. Ian caused catastrophic damage with losses estimated to be around $113 billion, making it the costliest hurricane in Florida's history, surpassing Irma of 2017, as well as the third-costliest in U.S. history, behind only Katrina of 2005 and Harvey of 2017 respectively. Much of the damage was from flooding brought about by a storm surge of 10–15 ft (3.0–4.6 m). The cities of Fort Myers, Cape Coral, and Naples were particularly hard hit, leaving millions without power in the storm's wake and numerous inhabitants forced to take refuge on their roofs. Sanibel Island, Fort Myers Beach, and Pine Island bore the brunt of Ian's powerful winds and its accompanying storm surge at landfall, which leveled thousands of standing structures in the region and collapsed the Sanibel Causeway and the Pine Island Causeway to Pine Island, entrapping those left on the islands for several days.","content":"#Meteorological history\n#Preparations\n##Caribbean\n###Jamaica\n###Cayman Islands\n###Cuba\n##United States\n###Florida\n###Georgia\n###South Carolina\n###Elsewhere\n##The Bahamas\n#Impact\n##Caribbean\n###Southern Caribbean and South America\n###Cayman Islands\n###Cuba\n##United States\n###Florida\n###The Carolinas\n###Elsewhere\n#Aftermath\n##Cuba\n##United States\n###Damage estimates\n#Depiction in media\n#Retirement\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Christianization_of_the_Roman_Empire_as_diffusion_of_innovation","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Christianization_of_the_Roman_Empire_as_diffusion_of_innovation","summary":"Christianization of the Roman Empire as diffusion of innovation looks at religious change in the Roman Empire's first three centuries through the lens of diffusion of innovations, a sociological theory popularized by Everett Rogers in 1962. Diffusion of innovation is a process of communication that takes place over time, among those within a social system, that explains how, why, and when new ideas (and technology) spread. In this theory, an innovation's success or failure is dependent upon the characteristics of the innovation itself, the adopters, what communication channels are used, time, and the social system in which it all happens. \nIn the empire's first three centuries, Roman society moved away from its established city based polytheism to adopt the religious innovation of monotheistic Christianity. Instead of explaining this through political and economic events, this approach focuses on the power of human social interactions as the drivers of societal change. This combines an understanding of Christian ideology and the utility of religion with analysis of social networks and their environment. While there are alternative explanations of Christianization of the Roman Empire, with differing levels of support from contemporary scholarship, this approach demonstrates that the cultural and religious change of the early Roman Empire can be understood as the cumulative result of multiple individual behaviors.\nChristianity was adopted relatively quickly. Five characteristics of diffusion can explain the speed at which this happened: first, if an innovation is seen as having a relative advantage over what it is replacing, it will be adopted more quickly. Christianity's relative advantage over its various competitors can be found in its altruism, its acceptance of those without Roman status, and the specific type of network it formed. Second, its compatibility with the people, society, or culture it coexists with will impact the rate of adoption. Christianity was not highly compatible with Roman polytheism, but it was compatible with the Judaism found in the diaspora communities. Its complexity also matters, since simple is generally adopted faster, and Christian inclusivity made it relatively simple. The next characteristic, trialability, is about how well the innovation allows access to information about itself before someone becomes a full-fledged member, and the conversion process in early Christianity allowed a flexible period of trialability. The last characteristic affecting speed of adoption is observability, because it is more likely someone will convert if the individual believes they have seen results. This is represented by who it was who adopted it, and by the social changes, such as charity and martyrdom, that those different adopters helped create. These qualities interact and are judged as a whole. For example, an innovation might be extremely complex, reducing its likelihood to be adopted and diffused, but it might also be very highly compatible, giving it a larger advantage relative to current tools, so that in spite of specific problems, potential adopters adopt the innovation anyway.\nSociologist E. A. Judge explains Christianization through this sociological view as having occurred as a result of the powerful combination of new ideas Christianity offered, and the social impact of the church, which he says formed the central pivotal point for the religious conversion of Rome.","content":"#Network theory and Diffusion of innovation as an approach\n##Innovation\n##Alternative approaches\n##Failure of diffusion\n#Five characteristics of diffusion\n##Relative advantage\n###Alms\n###Slavery through the fifth century\n###Geography and a scale free network\n##Compatibility and complexity\n##Trialability\n###Reinvention\n##Observability\n###Innovators of the first century\n###Early adopters in the first and second centuries\n###Third century early majority\n####Sexual morality\n####Persecution\n#Constantine as opinion leader\n#Notes\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#Further reading\n","lang":"en"}

The film is a fictionalized take on the life and career of American actress Marilyn Monroe, played by Ana de Armas. The cast also includes Adrien Brody, Bobby Cannavale, Xavier Samuel, and Julianne Nicholson.\nDede Gardner, Jeremy Kleiner, Tracey Landon, Brad Pitt, and Scott Robertson produced the film. After a lengthy period of development that began in 2010, Blonde entered production in August 2019 in Los Angeles. Production wrapped in July 2021, following the shutdowns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The film plays with shifting aspect ratios and alternates between color and black and white.\nBlonde premiered at the 79th Venice International Film Festival on September 8, 2022, where it received a 14-minute standing ovation. It began a limited theatrical release in the US on September 16, before its streaming release on September 28 by Netflix. It is the first NC-17-rated film to be released exclusively to a streaming service. The film received polarized reviews from critics and audiences; while de Armas's performance garnered acclaim, the fictionalisation of Monroe's life was considered exploitative and the screenplay was criticised.

{"title":"Tony_Bennett","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tony_Bennett","summary":"Anthony Dominick Benedetto (August 3, 1926 – July 21, 2023), known professionally as Tony Bennett, was an American jazz and traditional pop singer. He received many accolades, including 20 Grammy Awards, a Lifetime Achievement Award, and two Primetime Emmy Awards. Bennett was named a National Endowments for the Arts Jazz Master and a Kennedy Center Honoree. He founded the Frank Sinatra School of the Arts in Astoria, Queens, New York along with Exploring the Arts a non-profit arts education program. He sold more than 50 million records worldwide and earned a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\nBennett began singing at an early age. He fought in the final stages of World War II as a U.S. Army infantryman in the European Theater. Afterward, he developed his singing technique, signed with Columbia Records and had his first number-one popular song with \"Because of You\" in 1951. Several popular tracks such as \"Rags to Riches\" followed in early 1953. He then refined his approach to encompass jazz singing. He reached an artistic peak in the late 1950s with albums such as The Beat of My Heart and Basie Swings, Bennett Sings. In 1962, Bennett recorded his signature song, \"I Left My Heart in San Francisco\". His career and personal life experienced an extended downturn during the height of the rock music era. Bennett staged a comeback in the late 1980s and 1990s, putting out gold record albums again and expanding his reach to the MTV Generation while keeping his musical style intact.\nBennett continued to create popular and critically praised work into the 21st century. He attracted renewed acclaim late in his career for his collaboration with Lady Gaga, which began with the album Cheek to Cheek (2014); the two performers toured together to promote the album throughout 2014 and 2015. With the release of the duo's second album, Love for Sale (2021), Bennett broke the individual record for the longest run of a top-10 album on the Billboard 200 chart for any living artist; his first top-10 record was I Left My Heart in San Francisco in 1962. Bennett also broke the Guinness World Record for the oldest person to release an album of new material, at the age of 95 years and 60 days.\nIn February 2021, Bennett revealed that he had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 2016. Due to the slow progression of his illness, he continued to record, tour, and perform until his retirement from concerts due to physical challenges, which was announced after his final performances on August 3 and 5, 2021, at Radio City Music Hall.","content":"#Early life\n##1926–1943: Family and education\n##1944–1950: World War II and after\n#Career\n##1951–1959: First successes\n##1954–1965: A growing artistry\n##1965–1979: Years of struggle\n##1979–1989: Turnaround\n##1990–2006: Established career\n##2006–2021: Later years and final album\n#Artistry\n##Painting\n##Musical style\n#Awards and legacy\n#Works\n##Discography\n##Books\n#Personal life\n#Politics\n#Illness and death\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#Further reading\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Ștefan_Foriș","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ștefan_Foriș","summary":"Ștefan Foriș (Romanian pronunciation: [ˈʃteˈfan ˈforiʃ]; born István Fóris, also known as Marius; 9 May 1892 – summer 1946) was a Hungarian and Romanian communist journalist who served as general secretary of the Romanian Communist Party (PCR or PCdR) between December 1940 and April 1944. Born a Transylvanian Csángó and an Austro-Hungarian subject, he saw action with the Hungarian Landwehr throughout World War I. While training in mathematics at Eötvös Loránd University, he affiliated with the Galileo Circle and, moving to the far-left, entered the Hungarian Communist Party in late 1918. During the brief existence of a Hungarian Soviet Republic, he joined the war against Romania (1919), but subsequently opted to settle in the Romanian Kingdom, at Brașov. Foriș emerged as a local leader of the Socialist Party, largely failing at convincing his subordinates to join the PCR upon its creation (1921). He took up underground work even before the PCR was formally outlawed, while establishing his public profile as an accountant and a correspondent for moderate left-wing newspapers—including Adevărul and Facla.\nFrom his new home in Bucharest, Foriș presided upon two PCR front organizations, including the Red Aid's local branch and the Peasant Workers' Bloc. He was caught up in the repression of the mid-to-late 1920s, but escaped to the Soviet Union before being sentenced. He was a Comintern cadre to 1929, choosing to return to Bucharest in 1928, after a general amnesty. Foriș was assigned as head of agitprop, and worked in parallel as a correspondent of TASS; he also took a direct part in power struggles, being instrumental in the 1928 overthrow of general secretary Elek Köblös. A member of the PCR Central Committee in 1930, he was himself neutralized by the Romanian authorities between 1931 and 1935, when he was jailed and, by his own account, repeatedly beaten. Upon reemerging, he became personally involved in forging the PCR's popular front strategy, though he failed in his main goal of forming a reciprocal alliance with the National Peasants' Party. Under the National Renaissance Front dictatorship (1938–1940), Foriș traced a controversial policy for the PCR, sparking his personal conflict with activist Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu.\nForiș emerged as PCR leader following the ouster of Boris Stefanov, and was recognized as such by the Comintern during another one of his Soviet travels. He presided upon a particularly inauspicious period in communist history, which saw dwindling support for the PCR; Foriș was also tasked with explaining the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, with its truce between the Comintern and fascism—locally represented by the Iron Guard. He was notorious for his failure to predict the invasion of the Soviet Union by Nazi Germany and Romania in mid 1941, thereafter finding his legitimacy openly challenged by Petre \"Zidaru\" Gheorghe and Teohari Georgescu; in the aftermath, he also refused to sponsor a partisan movement, and obstructed others from attempting to form one. Foriș's leadership style also relied on isolation and atomization of the existing party cells, a matter which contributed to his own demise. In 1943, he upset the powerful \"prison faction\" centered on Caransebeș penitentiary—its leaders, Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej and Emil Bodnăraș, conspired with Constantin Pîrvulescu to have Foriș deposed.\nIn April 1944, an unusually docile Foriș agreed to Bodnăraș's forceful demands, and resigned on the spot. He was kidnapped alongside his lover Victoria Sârbu, and then held hostage in PCR safe houses. Gheorghiu-Dej eventually took over as general secretary, and only tolerated Foriș as a contributor to the PCR's illegal press. After the anti-German coup of 23 August, which brought the PCR into government, the Foriș–Sârbu couple was repeatedly tormented, and made aware that their freedom was relative. Allegedly contemplating emigration into Hungary, Foriș was again kidnapped on orders from the new party elite, and bludgeoned to death by Gheorghe Pintilie. He was singled out as a traitor in party literature, though his fate remained undisclosed until April 1968, which was three years after Gheorghiu-Dej's own death. Foriș was only partly rehabilitated by Nicolae Ceaușescu as the new general secretary, with constant reference being made to his \"grave mistakes\"; as a sign of reconciliation, his remains were dug up and reburied in the Freedom Park necropolis.","content":"#Biography\n##Early life\n##PCR outlawing\n##\"Popular front\" tactic\n##Taking over\n##Resisting the resistance\n##Caransebeș conspiracy\n##Capture\n##Killing\n#Legacy\n##Cover-up and rumors\n##Rehabilitation\n#Personal life and family\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

Police officers waited more than 1 hour and 14 minutes on-site before breaching the classroom to engage him. Police cordoned off the school grounds, resulting in violent conflicts between police and civilians, including parents, who were attempting to enter the school to rescue children. As a consequence, law enforcement officials in Uvalde were criticized for their response, and their conduct was reviewed in separate investigations by the Texas Ranger Division and United States Department of Justice.\nTexas Department of Public Safety (DPS) officials laid much of the responsibility for the police response on Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District Police Department (UCISD PD) Chief Arredondo, who they identified as the incident commander. Arredondo disputed the characterization of his role as incident commander, but was fired by the Uvalde school board. A report by the Texas House of Representatives Investigative Committee attributed the fault more widely to \"systemic failures and egregious poor decision making\" by many authorities. It said, \"At Robb Elementary, law enforcement responders failed to adhere to their active shooter training, and they failed to prioritize saving the lives of innocent victims over their own safety... there was an unacceptably long period of time before officers breached the classroom, neutralized the attacker, and began rescue efforts.\" Shortly after the shooting, local and state officials gave inaccurate reports of the timeline of events and exaggerated police actions. The Texas Department of Public Safety acknowledged it was an error for law enforcement to delay an assault on Ramos' position in the student-filled classrooms, attributing this to the school district police chief's assessment of the situation as one with a \"barricaded subject\", instead of an \"active shooter\". Law enforcement was aware there were injured individuals in the school before they made their entrance. In June 2024, two officers, including Arredondo, were criminally indicted for allegedly mishandling the response to the shooting.\nFollowing the shooting, which occurred 10 days after the 2022 Buffalo shooting, discussions ensued about American gun culture and violence, gridlock in politics, and law enforcement's failure to intervene during the attack. A month after the shooting, Congress passed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act and President Joe Biden signed it into law; it was the most significant federal gun reform legislation since the Federal Assault Weapons Ban of 1994.\nAfter the shooting, Robb Elementary was closed.

{"title":"2022–2023_Pentagon_document_leaks","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2022–2023_Pentagon_document_leaks","summary":"In April 2023, two sets of leaked classified foreign intelligence documents of the United States began circulating on Twitter, Telegram, and 4chan. Jack Teixeira, an airman first class of the Massachusetts Air National Guard, had allegedly photographed printouts of the documents at his parents' home in Dighton, Massachusetts, and posted them to the instant messaging platform Discord on a server named \"Thug Shaker Central\". The earliest posts dated to October 2022.\nThe documents are primarily related to the Russo-Ukrainian War, but also include foreign intelligence assessments concerning nations including North Korea, China, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates. A subset of documents was shared to Discord servers for a YouTuber and the sandbox video game Minecraft in late February and early March 2023. In April, a 4chan user posted several documents on the website's political imageboard \/pol\/. The documents were then spread throughout pro-Russian Telegram channels; at least one image was altered to show more Ukrainian casualties than Russian casualties.\nThe leaked documents contain operational briefs from the Joint Staff. Regarding the Russo-Ukrainian War, the documents suggest difficulties for both Russians and Ukrainians, in equal part; while one slide suggests that more Russians have died in the war than Ukrainians, several documents covering the Battle of Bakhmut suggest difficulties for Ukrainians in countering Russian flanking maneuvers and supply shortages in the area. Additionally, relations between Russia and other nations are covered, with multiple documents detailing efforts by Russian military intelligence agency GRU and paramilitary organization Wagner Group in promoting Russian ideals while downplaying American values. Other documents reveal attempts by Wagner Group to acquire weapons in Turkey, a NATO member. One set of documents alleges that Mossad encouraged staff and citizens to participate in judicial reform protests.\nThe leak spurred a diplomatic crisis between the United States and the Five Eyes. An interagency effort—composed of the Department of Defense, the White House, the Department of State, and the U.S. intelligence community—are assessing the leak. Concurrently, the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation have opened a criminal inquiry into the leaker. U.S. officials have accused Russia of being behind the leak.

{"title":"2023_Thai_general_election","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2023_Thai_general_election","summary":"General elections were held in Thailand on 14 May 2023 to elect 500 members of the House of Representatives. The Move Forward Party, led by Pita Limjaroenrat, surprised analysts by winning the most seats, followed by fellow opposition party Pheu Thai who had won the most seats in the 2011 and 2019 elections. Turnout was a record 75.22%.\nThe elections were held using a parallel voting system as in the 1997 and 2007 constitutions, in contrast to the mixed-member apportionment system used in 2019. Like in 2019, the elected prime minister did not need to be a member of the House and would be chosen by the full National Assembly, including the 250 military-appointed members of the Senate, for a total 376 seat majority. Due to the structure of the National Assembly, experts had warned of a possible gridlock scenario in which the current opposition parties secure more than half of the House votes but are obstructed in the Senate. Additionally, the Election Commission had received criticism over untrustworthiness, unprofessionalism, and bias in its conducting of the voting process.\nSixty-seven parties vied for seats. The ruling conservative coalition government was composed of the major Palang Pracharath, Bhumjai Thai, and Democrat parties, and smaller parties including the new United Thai Nation Party, who nominated former junta leader and incumbent prime minister Prayut Chan-o-cha after his split with Palang Pracharath. The pro-democratic opposition was led by the Pheu Thai and Move Forward parties, the latter being the effective successor of the dissolved Future Forward Party, which had performed unexpectedly well in the 2019 election. Political campaigns focused on the Thai economy, especially its recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Some parties, most notably Move Forward, also highlighted progressive issues, and challenged long-held social norms in Thailand.\nPita's Move Forward initially formed a coalition with the other pro-democracy, anti-military parties, which had a majority in the lower house but was unable to form a government after being functionally blocked by allies of the monarchy and military in the Senate. Pheu Thai then assumed the lead, dissolving its alliance with Move Forward and allying instead with conservative, pro-military parties. It then nominated real estate tycoon Srettha Thavisin as prime minister. He was elected by Parliament on 22 August. \nOn August 7, 2024, Thailand's Constitutional Court banned the victors of the election, the Move Forward Party and all of its leaders from politics for its proposal to reform the lèse-majesté law, arguing it posed a threat to the constitutional order.","content":"#Background\n#Electoral system\n##Prime ministerial candidates\n##2022 reapportionment and redistricting\n#Leading up to the election\n#Contesting parties\n#Overseas and advanced voting\n#Opinion polls\n##Preferred party\n##Preferred prime minister\n##Exit polls\n#Results\n##Results by province\n##Analysis\n#Government formation\n##Move Forward–led coalition\n##Pheu Thai–led coalition\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Hardeep_Singh_Nijjar","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hardeep_Singh_Nijjar","summary":"Hardeep Singh Nijjar (11 October 1977 – 18 June 2023) was a Canadian Sikh involved with the Khalistan movement, which calls for an independent Sikh state. \nBorn in India, Nijjar migrated to Canada in the mid-1990s. Some Sikh organizations viewed Nijjar as a human rights activist, while the Indian government accused him of being a criminal and terrorist affiliated with the militant Khalistan Tiger Force, and sought his arrest. Nijjar and his supporters rejected these allegations, saying he advocated peaceful means for creation of Khalistan. In 2016, Nijjar was placed on Canada's No Fly List and had his personal bank accounts frozen following allegations of his involvement in \"terror training camps\". Nijjar gained prominence in 2019, when he became the leader of Guru Nanak Sikh Gurudwara in Surrey, British Columbia, and became an advocate of Sikh separatism. Nijjar was also associated with Sikhs for Justice (SFJ), and spearheaded the group's Khalistan Referendum 2020 campaign.\nOn 18 June 2023, Nijjar was shot and killed in the parking lot of a Sikh temple (Gurdwara) in British Columbia. On 18 September 2023, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau stated that Canadian intelligence agencies were \"pursuing credible allegations of a potential link\" between Indian government agents and the assassination of Nijjar. After the killing, Canada expelled an Indian diplomat from the country. India's foreign ministry denied involvement in the killing, and expelled a top Canadian diplomat as a retaliatory measure. \nIn May 2024, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) arrested three Indian nationals, who were charged with killing Nijjar. The Canadian investigations are ongoing, including into possible connections between the killing and the Indian government.\nIn October 2024, Canada expelled six Indian diplomats, including the High Commissioner Sanjay Kumar Verma, as persona non grata. This occurred after Canada said they provided India with \"irrefutable evidence\" of links between Indian government agents and the murders of both Nijjar and of Sukhdool Singh, who was shot in Winnipeg on 20 September 2023;  Canadian officals say that the six officials were \"directly involved in gathering detailed intelligence on Sikh separatists who were then killed, attacked or threatened by India’s criminal proxies\".","content":"#Early life and immigration to Canada\n#Involvement with Sikh organisations\n#Allegations of militant activities\n#Death, subsequent diplomatic dispute and criminal investigation\n##Criminal investigation in Canada\n##Allegation of Indian responsibility\n##Diplomatic fallout\n##Reactions\n###Indian Canadians\n###Five Eyes\n###Bangladesh\n###Pakistan\n###Sri Lanka\n#Notes\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Tornadoes_of_2023","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tornadoes_of_2023","summary":"This is a list of notable tornadoes and tornado outbreaks worldwide in 2023. Strong, destructive tornadoes form most frequently in the United States, Argentina, Brazil, Bangladesh and East India, but can occur almost anywhere. Tornadoes develop occasionally in southern Canada during the Northern Hemisphere's summer, and at other times of the year across Europe, Asia, Argentina, Australia and New Zealand. They are often accompanied by other forms of severe weather, including thunderstorms, strong winds, and large hail. Worldwide, 116 tornado-related deaths were confirmed – 83 in the United States, 12 in China, nine in Indonesia, eight in Myanmar, three in Turkey, and one in Saudi Arabia.\nJanuary had the third-highest number of tornado watches and confirmed tornadoes of any January on record in the United States. The first two months of the year had the fourth-highest number of confirmed tornadoes for the first 59 days of any year on record. The year was deadlier than average, with a number of fatal tornadoes. By April 5, 63 tornado-related deaths were recorded in the United States; this was almost three times higher than 2022's total of 23 fatalities, approaching the annual average of roughly 70 deaths. Below-average tornadic activity occurred in May, but active weather patterns spawned damaging tornado outbreaks throughout the summer and 12 more people died. Damaging tornadoes also affected parts of Canada during that time, including the country's first violent tornado since 2018. Tornadic activity decreased dramatically in September, and was almost non-existent during much of the autumn. Most Atlantic tropical cyclones missed the United States during the peak of hurricane season, with few early-season frontal systems; an intense outbreak in December produced 18 tornadoes, causing seven fatalities.\nSeveral European organizations, including the European Severe Storms Laboratory and Deutscher Wetterdienst, began publishing and using the new International Fujita scale in August 2023. The first major tornado outbreak using the scale occurred three months later, when Storm Ciarán affected much of Europe.","content":"#North America\n##United States tornadoes by month\n#January\n##January 2–4 (United States)\n##January 12 (United States)\n##January 24–25 (United States)\n#February\n##February 16–17 (United States)\n##February 26–27 (United States)\n#March\n##March 1–3 (United States)\n##March 22 (California)\n##March 24–27 (United States)\n##March 31 – April 1 (United States)\n#April\n##April 4–5 (United States)\n##April 15 (United States)\n##April 19–20 (United States)\n##April 27–30 (United States)\n#May\n##May 6–7 (United States)\n##May 10–13 (United States)\n#June\n##June 14–19 (United States)\n##June 20–26 (United States and Canada)\n#July\n##July 1 (Canada)\n##July 12–13 (United States and Canada)\n##July 19 (North Carolina)\n#August\n##August 4–8 (United States)\n##August 18 (United States)\n##August 24–25 (United States and Canada)\n#October\n##October 11–12 (Florida)\n#December\n##December 9–10 (United States)\n#Europe\n##January 17 (Italy)\n##February 1 (Germany)\n##March 9 (France)\n##April 10 (Europe)\n##April 20 (Turkey)\n##May 6 (Europe)\n##July 22 (Italy)\n##August 1 (Europe)\n##September 17 (Europe)\n##September 19 (Denmark)\n##September 21 (Germany)\n##October 28 (United Kingdom)\n##November 1–4 (Europe)\n##November 25 (Greece)\n##December 10 (Ireland)\n##December 21 (Germany)\n##December 22 (Poland)\n##December 27 (United Kingdom)\n#Asia\n##March 13 (Saudi Arabia)\n##March 24 (India)\n##April 15 (China)\n##April 21 (Myanmar)\n##April 22–23 (Oman)\n##April 28 (Indonesia)\n##June 1 (China)\n##June 14 (Pakistan)\n##July 17 (China)\n##August 13 (China)\n##September 19 (China)\n#Elsewhere\n##April 9–11 (New Zealand)\n##July 12 (Brazil)\n##October 4 (Brazil)\n##December 12 (Australia)\n##December 25 (Australia)\n#Tornadic research\n#See also\n#Notes\n","lang":"en"}
{"title":"Sator_Square","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sator_Square","summary":"The Sator Square (or Rotas-Sator Square or Templar Magic Square) is a two-dimensional acrostic class of word square containing a five-word Latin palindrome.  The earliest squares were found at Roman-era sites, all in ROTAS-form (where the top line is \"ROTAS\", not \"SATOR\"), with the earliest discovery at Pompeii (and also likely pre-A.D. 62).  The earliest square with Christian-associated imagery dates from the sixth century. By the Middle Ages, Sator squares had been found across Europe, Asia Minor, and North Africa.  In 2022, the Encyclopedia Britannica called it \"the most familiar lettered square in the Western world\".\nA significant volume of academic research has been published on the square, but after more than a century, there is no consensus on its origin and meaning.  The discovery of the \"Paternoster theory\" in 1926 led to a brief consensus amongst academics that the square was created by early Christians, but the subsequent discoveries at Pompeii led many academics to believe that the square was more likely created as a Roman word puzzle (as per the Roma-Amor puzzle), which was later adopted by Christians.  This origin theory, however,  fails to explain how a Roman word puzzle then became such a powerful religious and magical medieval symbol. It has instead been argued that the square was created in its ROTAS-form as a Jewish symbol, embedded with cryptic religious symbolism, which was later adopted in its SATOR-form by Christians. There are many other less-supported academic origin theories, such as a Pythagorean or Stoic puzzle, a Gnostic or Orphic or Italian pagan amulet, a cryptic Mithraic or Semitic numerology charm, or that it was simply a device for working out wind directions.\nThe square has long associations with magical powers throughout its history (and even up to the 19th century in North and South America), including a perceived ability to extinguish fires, particularly in Germany.  The square appears in early and late medieval medical textbooks such as the Trotula, and was employed as a medieval cure for many ailments, particularly for dog bites and rabies, as well as for insanity, and relief during childbirth.\nIt has featured in a diverse range of contemporary artworks including fiction books, paintings, musical scores, and films, and most notably in Christopher Nolan's 2020 film Tenet.  In 2020, The Daily Telegraph called it \"one of the closest things the classical world had to a meme\".","content":"#Description and naming\n#Discovery and dating\n#Translation\n##Individual words\n##Sentence construction\n##Arepo interpretations\n##Further anagrams\n#Origin and meaning\n##Christian symbol\n###Adoption by Christians\n###Paternoster theory\n##Roman word puzzle\n##Jewish symbol\n##Other theories\n#Magical and medical associations\n#Notable examples\n##Roman\n##Early medieval\n##Later medieval\n##Other\n#In popular culture\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

A number of human rights organizations and governments – including the United States, European Parliament, Canada, France, Uruguay, Cyprus – stated that Azerbaijan had launched an attack on positions inside the Republic of Armenia.\nAzerbaijani forces attacked military and civilian positions in Vardenis, Goris, Sotk, Jermuk, and other cities with artillery, drones, and heavy weapons. Azerbaijan claimed that Armenian forces had staged \"large-scale subversive acts\" using \"saboteurs\" who planted landmines, an allegation the government spread during the days following the invasion and also echoed by Azerbaijan's ally Turkey. Various journalists, politicians, and political analysts scrutinized these allegations and considered them unfounded or unverifiable. \nThe fighting ended with Azerbaijani troops taking control of strategic positions deep inside Armenia, with at least 7600 civilians displaced from Armenian provinces. Russia said on 13 September that it had brokered a ceasefire, but both sides confirmed it was broken minutes after coming into effect. On 14 September, Armenia and Azerbaijan brokered a new ceasefire. Armenia requested that the CSTO provide military support; however, the military alliance refused to provide support. The clashes erupted shortly after Russia suffered serious setbacks in the Kharkiv counteroffensive during the invasion of Ukraine, weakening its force projection in the Caucasus.  \nFollowing a meeting between leaders of Azerbaijan and Armenia at the invitation of the President of France, and the President of the European Council, an EU civilian monitoring mission consisting of 40 people was deployed on the Armenian side of the border (Azerbaijan did not grant access to its side), and an OSCE assessment mission will be sent to Armenia.","content":"#Background\n#Timeline\n##12–13 September\n##14–16 September\n##21–29 September\n#Shelling of Russian military\n#Suspected war crimes and crimes against humanity\n#Infrastructure damage\n#Effects\n##Cancelled events\n##Protests in Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh\n##Anti-war opposition in Azerbaijan\n##Sports\n#Analysis\n#Reactions\n##Countries\n##Organizations\n#See also\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"2022_Atlantic_hurricane_season","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2022_Atlantic_hurricane_season","summary":"The 2022 Atlantic hurricane season was a destructive and deadly Atlantic hurricane season. Despite having an average number of named storms and below average amount of major hurricanes, it became the fourth-costliest Atlantic hurricane season on record, behind only 2017, 2024, and 2005, mostly due to Hurricane Ian. The season officially began on June 1, and ended on November 30. These dates, adopted by convention, historically describe the period in each year when most subtropical or tropical cyclogenesis occurs in the Atlantic Ocean. This year's first Atlantic named storm, Tropical Storm Alex, developed five days after the start of the season, making this the first season since 2014 not to have a pre-season named storm.\nTwo systems developed on July 1. Tropical Storm Bonnie formed and made landfall near the Costa Rica–Nicaragua border. It then crossed over into the Pacific basin, becoming the first to survive the crossover from the Atlantic to the Pacific since Hurricane Otto in 2016. Also, Tropical Storm Colin formed abruptly and made landfall in South Carolina, before quickly weakening and dissipating the next day. Following this activity, tropical cyclogenesis was suppressed across the basin for several weeks by a combination of increased wind shear and the presence of the Saharan Air Layer. This stopped all tropical cyclogenesis in August, the first season to do so since 1997, and the first during a La Niña. After an almost 60-day lull in tropical cyclone activity, hurricanes Danielle and Earl formed on September 1 and 3 respectively, with Danielle becoming the season's first hurricane. The last season to have its first hurricane develop this late was 2013.\nActivity then increased tremendously towards the end of September as four named storms formed in quick succession. Among them, Hurricane Fiona became the season's first major hurricane on September 20, which is about three weeks later than when the first one typically forms. As an extratropical cyclone it became the strongest storm in Canadian history, as measured by atmospheric pressure, and caused significant damage in Atlantic Canada. Hurricane Ian then became the second major hurricane of the season on September 27 and the only Category 5 of the season on September 28 and inflicted an estimated $113.1 billion in damage to western Cuba, Southwestern and Central Florida, and the Carolinas. Hurricane Julia formed in early October and became the second storm of the season to cross over into the Pacific basin intact after traversing Nicaragua, making this season the first to have more than one crossover system since 1996. The last storm in the season, Hurricane Nicole, made landfall on the coasts of the Bahamas and Florida. It was the first November hurricane to make landfall in Florida since Kate in 1985, and caused about $1 billion in damage in areas devastated by Ian six weeks earlier. Tropical cyclones during this season collectively caused at least 304 deaths and more than $117.7 billion in damage, making it one of the costliest seasons on record.\nMost forecasting agencies anticipated a well-above average season due to warmer-than-normal sea surface temperatures and a favorable El Niño–Southern Oscillation pattern, limiting the chances of El Niño developing. While conducive conditions such as warmer sea surface temperatures and a La Niña came to fruition, the unfavorable wind shear pattern with drier air and Saharan Air Layer suppressed tropical cyclogenesis through most of July and the entirety of August, with the latter typically being among the most active climatologically.","content":"#Seasonal forecasts\n##Pre-season forecasts\n##Mid-season forecasts\n#Seasonal summary\n##Background\n##Early season activity\n##Peak to late season activity\n#Systems\n##Tropical Storm Alex\n##Tropical Storm Bonnie\n##Tropical Storm Colin\n##Hurricane Danielle\n##Hurricane Earl\n##Hurricane Fiona\n##Tropical Storm Gaston\n##Hurricane Ian\n##Tropical Storm Hermine\n##Tropical Depression Eleven\n##Tropical Depression Twelve\n##Hurricane Julia\n##Tropical Storm Karl\n##Hurricane Lisa\n##Hurricane Martin\n##Hurricane Nicole\n##Other system\n#Storm names\n##Retirement\n#Season effects\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

Jeyamohan. Produced by Ratnam and Subaskaran Allirajah under Madras Talkies and Lyca Productions, it is the first of two cinematic parts based on Kalki Krishnamurthy's 1955 novel, Ponniyin Selvan. The film stars an ensemble cast including  Vikram, Karthi, Jayam Ravi, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Trisha, Jayaram, Aishwarya Lekshmi, Sobhita Dhulipala, Prakash Raj, Prabhu, R. Sarathkumar, R. Parthiban, Rahman, Lal and Vikram Prabhu. The music was composed by A. R. Rahman, with cinematography by Ravi Varman, editing by A. Sreekar Prasad, and production design by Thota Tharani. Ponniyin Selvan: I dramatises the early life of Chola prince Arunmozhi Varman, who would become the renowned emperor Rajaraja I (947–1014). In the film, Vandiyathevan sets out to cross the Chola land to deliver a message from the crown prince Aditha Karikalan. Meanwhile, Kundavai attempts to establish political peace as vassals and petty chieftains plot against the throne.\nEver since its publication, a film adaptation of the novel Ponniyin Selvan had been explored by several Tamil filmmakers, including an attempt by M. G. Ramachandran in the late 1950s; however, it never materialised. Decades later, Ratnam attempted to adapt the novel in the late-1980s and early-2010s but was unsuccessful due to financial constraints. He eventually managed to revive the effort in January 2019, after Lyca agreed to fund the film. Following several changes in cast and crew, production of Ponniyin Selvan began in December 2019 and concluded in September 2021, halting twice due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The film was shot in various locations across India, with a few sequences in Thailand. It was originally intended to be a single film but was split into two parts.\nPonniyin Selvan: I was released in theatres worldwide on 30 September 2022 in standard and IMAX formats. Ponniyin Selvan: I met with critical acclaim, with emphasis on the direction, musical score, technical aspects, and the cast's performances (with some reviews praising Vikram, Karthi, Jayam Ravi, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Trisha, Jayaram and entire cast performances).The film grossed ₹450–500 crore worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing Tamil film of 2022, third-highest-grossing Indian film of 2022. The film is currently the fourth highest-grossing Tamil film of all time. The film received six nominations at the 16th Asian Film Awards, including Best Film.  It won the Best Tamil film award at the 68th Filmfare Awards. The film also won 4 National Awards, in the 70th National Awards, announced on 16th August, 2024, including the best film.","content":"#Plot\n#Cast\n#Production\n#Music\n#Marketing\n#Release\n##Theatrical\n##Distribution\n##Home media\n#Reception\n##Critical response\n##Box office\n##Controversies\n#Accolades\n#Sequel\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

Milei has taught university courses and written on various aspects of economics and politics, and also hosted radio programs on the subject. Milei's views distinguish him within Argentine politics.\nIn November 2021, Milei was elected to the Argentine Chamber of Deputies, representing the City of Buenos Aires for La Libertad Avanza. As a national deputy, he limited his legislative activities to voting, focusing instead on critiquing what he sees as Argentina's political elite and its propensity for high government spending. Milei pledged not to raise taxes and donated his national deputy salary through a monthly raffle. He defeated economy minister Sergio Massa in the second round of the 2023 Argentine presidential election on a platform that held the ideological dominance of Peronism responsible for the ongoing 2018 Argentine monetary crisis.\nMilei is known for his flamboyant personality, distinctive personal style, and strong media presence. He has been described politically as a right-wing populist and right-wing libertarian, and supports laissez-faire economics, aligning specifically with minarchist and anarcho-capitalist principles. Milei has proposed a comprehensive overhaul of the country's fiscal and structural policies. He supports freedom of choice on drug policy, firearms, sex work, and same-sex marriage, while opposing abortion and euthanasia. In foreign policy, he advocates closer relations with the United States and Israel, supporting Ukraine in response to the Russian invasion of the country.","content":"#Early life and education\n#Economics career\n#Early political career\n##Rise to prominence\n##2021 legislative campaign\n#National deputyship\n#2023 Argentine general election\n##2023 presidential campaign\n##Primary and general elections\n#Presidency (2023–present)\n##Inauguration\n##First acts\n##Economy\n#Political positions\n#Public image\n#Personal life\n#Electoral history\n##Executive\n##Legislative\n#Radio\n#Publications\n##Books\n##Journal articles\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}
{"title":"Indeterminacy_debate_in_legal_theory","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Indeterminacy_debate_in_legal_theory","summary":"The indeterminacy debate in legal theory can be summed up as follows: Can the law constrain the results reached by adjudicators in legal disputes? Some members of the critical legal studies movement — primarily legal academics in the United States — argued that the answer to this question is \"no.\" Another way to state this position is to suggest that disputes cannot be resolved with clear answers, and thus there is at least some amount of uncertainty in legal reasoning and its application to disputes. A given body of legal doctrine is said to be \"indeterminate\" by demonstrating that every legal rule in that body of legal doctrine is opposed by a counterrule that can be used in a process of legal reasoning.\nThe indeterminacy thesis emerged as a left reply to Ronald Dworkin's \"right answer\" thesis. In its strongest form it is an extreme version of legal realism. It argues that nothing is law until it has been promulgated by an official - either a judge or the legislature. For example, a statute that says \"No person may smoke in a hospital\" does not mean that \"John Doe may not smoke in a hospital\"; the second statement is the law only if a legitimate authority declares so.\nThis is because one cannot describe a legal statement as right or wrong without making a normative value judgment about what the law should be.\nIn the 1990s the indeterminacy thesis came under heavy attack by liberal and conservative defenders of the rule of law, and the debate, though its mantle is in the process of being taken up by a new generation of scholars, has left the intellectual spotlight for the time being.\nThe thesis can be criticised because the concept of legal mistake is recognised in a determinative theory of law. While such a mistake necessarily involves a normative judgment, it is not truly subjective. A positivist Hartian theory contends that this judgment is conventionally objective, because the rule of recognition fails to recognise the mistake as legally valid. According to a liberal theory such as Dworkin's, the normativity of the judgment is one of reason rather than of value.","content":"#See also\n#Bibliography\n","lang":"en"}

Bouldering started in Fontainebleau, and was advanced by Pierre Allain in the 1930s, and John Gill in the 1950s.  Big wall climbing started in the Dolomites, and was spread across the Alps in the 1930s by climbers such as Emilio Comici and Riccardo Cassin, and in the 1950s by Walter Bonatti, before reaching Yosemite where it was led in the 1950s to 1970s by climbers such as Royal Robbins.  Single-pitch climbing started pre-1900 in both the Lake District and in Saxony, and by the late-1970s had spread widely with climbers such as Ron Fawcett (Britain), Bernd Arnold (Germany), Patrick Berhault (France), Ron Kauk and John Bachar (USA).\nAs a free solo exercise with no artificial aid or climbing protection, bouldering remained largely consistent since its origins. Single-pitch climbing generally stopped using artificial aid in the early 20th-century, led by Paul Preuss, so-called \"free climbing\". Free climbing of Big Walls started before World War I, and was advanced by Emil Solleder in the 20s, Batista Vinatzer in the 30s, and Mathias Rebitsch in the late-40s.  Climbing protection was needed for single-pitch and big-wall free climbing, and was inserted into the route while climbing; this is now called \"traditional climbing\". By the 1980s, French pioneers like Patrick Edlinger wanted to climb rock faces in Buoux and Verdon that had few cracks in which to insert traditional climbing protection.  Controversially, they pre-drilled bolts from above on rappel, using battery powered drills, into potential new routes for protection (but not as artificial aid); this became known as \"sport climbing\". It led to a dramatic increase in climbing standards, grades, and tools (e.g. artificial climbing walls and campus boards), the development of competition climbing (initially dominated in the 1990s by French climbers such as François Legrand), and the \"professional\" rock climber.\nBy the end of the 20th-century, the hardest sport climbs were often combinations of bouldering-moves, and some of the best challenges lay in free climbing extreme big walls; this led to greater cross-over amongst the three sub-disciplines.  Leading climbers such as Wolfgang Güllich, Jerry Moffatt, Alexander Huber, Fred Nicole, Chris Sharma, Adam Ondra, and Tommy Caldwell set records in several of these disciplines.  Güllich and Huber also made ever-bolder single-pitch free solo climbs, while Sharma pushed standards in deep-water soloing; Alex Honnold's big wall free soloing was turned into the Oscar-winning film, Free Solo.  In 2016, the IOC announced that competition climbing would be a medal sport in the 2020 Summer Olympics.\nFemale rock climbing developed later in the 20th-century but by the 1980s, climbers such as Lynn Hill and Catherine Destivelle were closing the gap to the standard of routes being climbed by the leading men.   By the 21st-century, Josune Bereziartu, Angela Eiter and Ashima Shiraishi, had closed the gap to the highest sport and boulder climbing grades achieved by men to within one\/two notches; Beth Rodden fully closed the gap for traditional climbing grades in 2008 and Janja Garnbret became the most successful competition climber in history with 42 IFSC world cup golds.","content":"#Origins\n#19th century\n#1900s\n#1910s\n#1920s\n#1930s\n#1940s\n#1950s\n#1960s\n#1970s\n#1980s\n#1990s\n#2000s\n#2010s\n#2020s\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Pottery","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pottery","summary":"Pottery is the process and the products of forming vessels and other objects with clay and other raw materials, which are fired at high temperatures to give them a hard and durable form. The place where such wares are made by a potter is also called a pottery (plural potteries). The definition of pottery, used by the ASTM International, is \"all fired ceramic wares that contain clay when formed, except technical, structural, and refractory products\". End applications include tableware, decorative ware, sanitary ware, and in technology and industry such as electrical insulators and laboratory ware. In art history and archaeology, especially of ancient and prehistoric periods, pottery often means only vessels, and sculpted figurines of the same material are called terracottas. \n\nPottery is one of the oldest human inventions, originating before the Neolithic period, with ceramic objects such as the Gravettian culture Venus of Dolní Věstonice figurine discovered in the Czech Republic dating back to 29,000–25,000 BC. However, the earliest known pottery vessels were discovered in Jiangxi, China, which date back to 18,000 BC. Other early Neolithic and pre-Neolithic pottery artifacts have been found, in Jōmon Japan (10,500 BC), the Russian Far East (14,000 BC), Sub-Saharan Africa (9,400 BC), South America (9,000s–7,000s BC), and the Middle East (7,000s–6,000s BC).\n\nPottery is made by forming a clay body into objects of a desired shape and heating them to high temperatures (600–1600 °C) in a bonfire, pit or kiln, which induces reactions that lead to permanent changes including increasing the strength and rigidity of the object. Much pottery is purely utilitarian, but some can also be regarded as ceramic art. An article can be decorated before or after firing.\nPottery is traditionally divided into three types: earthenware, stoneware and porcelain. All three may be glazed and unglazed. All may also be decorated by various techniques. In many examples the group a piece belongs to is immediately visually apparent, but this is not always the case; for example fritware uses no or little clay, so falls outside these groups. Historic pottery of all these types is often grouped as either \"fine\" wares, relatively expensive and well-made, and following the aesthetic taste of the culture concerned, or alternatively \"coarse\", \"popular\", \"folk\" or \"village\" wares, mostly undecorated, or simply so, and often less well-made.\nCooking in pottery became less popular once metal pots became available, but is still used for dishes that benefit from the qualities of pottery cooking, typically slow cooking in an oven, such as biryani, cassoulet, daube, tagine, jollof rice, kedjenou, cazuela and types of baked beans.","content":"#Main types\n##Earthenware\n##Stoneware\n##Porcelain\n#Archaeology\n##Fabric analysis\n#Clay bodies and raw materials\n#Production\n##Shaping\n##Drying\n##Firing\n###Temperature\n###Atmosphere\n###Methods\n###Stages\n##Decorating\n###Methods\n##Glazing\n##Health and environmental issues\n#History\n##Early pottery\n##History by region\n###Beginnings of pottery\n###East Asia\n###South Asia\n###Southeast Asia\n###West Asia\n###Europe\n###United Kingdom\n###Arabic pottery\n###Americas\n###Africa\n###Oceania\n#See also\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}
{"title":"Exodus_of_Kashmiri_Hindus","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Exodus_of_Kashmiri_Hindus","summary":"The Exodus of Kashmiri Hindus, or Pandits, is their early-1990 migration, or flight, from the Muslim-majority Kashmir valley in Indian-administered Kashmir  following rising violence in an insurgency. Of a total Pandit population of 120,000–140,000 some 90,000–100,000 left the valley or felt compelled to leave by the middle of 1990,\nby which time about 30–80 of them are said to have been killed by militants.\nDuring the period of substantial migration, the insurgency was being led by a group calling for a secular and independent Kashmir, but there were also growing Islamist factions demanding an Islamic state. Although their numbers of dead and injured were low, the Pandits, who believed that Kashmir's culture was tied to India's, experienced fear and panic set off by targeted killings of some members of their community—including high-profile officials among their ranks—and public calls for independence among the insurgents. The accompanying rumours and uncertainty together with the absence of guarantees for their safety by the state government might have been the latent causes of the exodus. The descriptions of the violence as \"genocide\" or \"ethnic cleansing\" in some Hindu nationalist publications or among suspicions voiced by some exiled Pandits are widely considered inaccurate and aggressive by scholars.\nThe reasons for this migration are vigorously contested. In 1989–1990, as calls by Kashmiri Muslims for independence from India gathered pace, many Kashmiri Pandits, who viewed self-determination to be anti-national, felt under pressure. The killings in the 1990s of a number of Pandit officials, may have shaken the community's sense of security, although it is thought some Pandits—by virtue of their evidence given later in Indian courts—may have acted as agents of the Indian state. The Pandits killed in targeted assassinations by the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) included some high-profile ones. Occasional anti Hindu calls were made from mosques on loudspeakers asking Pandits to leave the valley. News of threatening letters created fear,  though in later interviews the letters were seen to have been sparingly received.  There were disparities between the accounts of the two communities, the Muslims and the Pandits. Many Kashmiri Pandits believed they were forced out of the Valley either by Pakistan and the militants it supported or the Kashmiri Muslims as a group. Many Kashmiri Muslims did not support violence against religious minorities; the departure of the Kashmiri Pandits offered an excuse for casting Kashmiri Muslims as Islamic radicals, thereby contaminating their more genuine political grievances, and offering a rationale for their surveillance and violent treatment by the Indian state. Many Muslims in the Valley believed that the then Governor, Jagmohan had encouraged the Pandits to leave so as to have a free hand in more thoroughly pursuing reprisals against Muslims.  Several scholarly views chalk up the migration to genuine panic among the Pandits that stemmed as much from the religious vehemence among some of the insurgents as by the absence of guarantees for the Pandits' safety issued by the Governor.\n\nKashmiri Pandits initially moved to the Jammu Division, the southern half of Jammu and Kashmir, where they lived in refugee camps, sometimes in unkempt and unclean surroundings. At the time of their exodus, very few Pandits expected their exile to last beyond a few months. As the exile lasted longer, many displaced Pandits who were in the urban elite were able to find jobs in other parts of India, but those in the lower-middle-class, especially those from rural areas languished longer in refugee camps, with some living in poverty; this generated tensions with the host communities—whose social and religious practices, although Hindu, differed from those of the brahmin Pandits—and rendered assimilation more difficult. \nMany displaced Pandits in the camps succumbed to emotional depression and a sense of helplessness.  The cause of the Kashmiri Pandits was quickly championed by right-wing Hindu groups in India, which also preyed on their insecurities and further alienated them from Kashmiri Muslims.   Some displaced Kashmiri Pandits have formed an organization called Panun Kashmir (\"Our own Kashmir\"), which has asked for a separate homeland for Kashmiri Hindus in the Valley but has opposed autonomy for Kashmir on the grounds that it would promote the formation of an Islamic state.  The return to the homeland in Kashmir also constitutes one of the main points of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party's election platform.  Although discussions between the Pandits and the Muslims have been hampered by the insistence on the part of each of their deprivation, and a rejection of the other's suffering, the Pandits who have left Kashmir have felt separated and obliterated. Kashmiri Pandits in exile have written autobiographical memoirs, novels, and poetry to record their experiences and to understand them. 19 January is observed by the Kashmiri Hindu communities as Exodus Day.","content":"#Background\n#Insurgency activity\n##Attack and threats\n#Aftermath\n#Rehabilitation\n#In popular culture\n##Books\n##Movies\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#Further reading\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

The second depression and the first cyclonic storm of the 2023 North Indian Ocean cyclone season, Mocha originated from a low-pressure area that was first noted by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) on 8 May. After consolidating into a depression, the storm tracked slowly north-northwestward over the Bay of Bengal, and reached extremely severe cyclonic storm intensity. After undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle, Mocha rapidly strengthened, peaking at Category 5-equivalent intensity on 14 May with winds of 270 km\/h (165 mph). Mocha slightly weakened before making landfall, and its conditions quickly became unfavorable. Mocha rapidly weakened once inland and dissipated shortly thereafter.\nThousands of volunteers assisted citizens of Myanmar and Bangladesh in evacuating as the cyclone approached the international border. Evacuations were also ordered for low-lying areas in Sittwe, Pauktaw, Myebon, Maungdaw, and Buthidaung. In Bangladesh, over 500,000 individuals were ordered to be relocated from coastal areas of the country due to the storm's approach. Officials from the military declared the state of Rakhine a natural disaster area. Several villages in Rakhine State were also damaged by the cyclone. The death toll for Cyclone Mocha varies significantly. ASEAN reported a total of 145 deaths, whereas the National Unity Government of Myanmar (NUG) stated that Cyclone Mocha killed at least 463 people, including three indirect deaths in Bangladesh. The storm also injured 719 people and left 101 others missing. It caused about US$2.24 billion of damage in Myanmar.\nElsewhere, thousands of homes were destroyed in Bangladesh. Twelve people were injured, and the agricultural damage there reached ৳115 million (US$1.07 million), though impact was less severe than initially feared. Seven people in Sri Lanka were indirectly injured and another seven were reported missing due to the cyclone. In India, 5,749 people across over 50 villages were affected, and at least 236 houses were damaged. The remnants of Mocha then contributed to blizzards in China.","content":"#Meteorological history\n#Effects\n##Myanmar\n###Preparations\n###Impact\n##Bangladesh\n##Sri Lanka\n##India\n##China\n#Aftermath\n##Myanmar\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

In a separate libel trial in England, in which Depp sued News Group Newspapers Ltd over an article published in The Sun, the presiding judge ruled against Depp, stating, \"[T]he great majority of alleged assaults of Ms. Heard by Mr. Depp have been proved to the civil standard.\" Several legal experts suggested that Depp had a smaller chance of winning in the US trial compared to the UK trial.\nIn the Virginia trial, Depp's claims related to a December 2018 op-ed by Heard, published in The Washington Post. Depp claimed Heard caused new damage to his reputation and career by stating that she had spoken up against \"sexual violence\" and \"faced our culture's wrath\"; that \"two years ago, [she] became a public figure representing domestic abuse\" and \"felt the full force of our culture’s wrath for women who speak out\"; and that she \"had the rare vantage point of seeing, in real time, how institutions protect men accused of abuse\". Heard's counterclaims included allegations that Adam Waldman, Depp's former lawyer, had defamed her in statements published in the Daily Mail in 2020. Throughout the trial, Depp's legal team sought to disprove Heard's domestic abuse allegations and to demonstrate that she had been the instigator, rather than the victim, of intimate partner violence. Heard's lawyers defended the op-ed, claiming it to be factual and protected by the First Amendment.\nThe jury ruled that Heard's op-ed references to \"sexual violence\" and \"domestic abuse\" were false and defamed Depp with actual malice and awarded Depp $10 million in compensatory damages and $5 million in punitive damages from Heard, although the court reduced the punitive damages to $350,000 due to a limit imposed by Virginia state law. They also ruled that Depp had defamed Heard through Waldman, who had falsely alleged that Heard and her friends \"roughed up\" Depp's penthouse as part of an \"ambush, a hoax\". They awarded Heard $2 million in compensatory damages and $0 in punitive damages from Depp. Separately, the jury ruled that Waldman's other allegations of Heard's \"sexual violence hoax\" and \"abuse hoax\" against Depp had not been proven defamatory.\nAfter the trial ended, Heard put forth motions to set aside the verdict, but was unsuccessful. Then, both Depp and Heard appealed against the respective verdicts. In December 2022, both parties reached a settlement and dropped their appeals, with Depp's lawyers Benjamin Chew and Camille Vasquez stating that Depp would receive $1 million from Heard.\nThe livestreamed trial attracted large numbers of viewers and considerable social media response. The majority of the social media response was sympathetic to Depp and critical of Heard. The trial renewed debates around topics relating to domestic violence, the #MeToo movement, and women's rights, although some commentators were more skeptical of the trial's long term implications.","content":"#Background\n##Depp and Heard's relationship\n##Depp v News Group Newspapers Ltd\n##Heard's op-ed in The Washington Post\n##Waldman's comments in the Daily Mail\n#Civil action\n##Pre-trial developments\n##Trial\n###Opening statements\n###Testimony\n###Closing arguments\n###Verdict\n##Post-trial motions\n##Appeals, settlement and carrier lawsuit\n#Reactions\n##Livestream\n##Social media coverage\n##Comments by juror\n##The Washington Post\n##Commentary on verdict\n#Media coverage\n##Film adaptation\n##Books\n##TV\n##Podcast\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}
{"title":"SpaceX_Starship","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/SpaceX_Starship","summary":"Starship is a two-stage fully reusable super heavy-lift launch vehicle under development by American aerospace company SpaceX. On April 20, 2023, with the first Integrated Flight Test, Starship became the most massive and most powerful vehicle ever to fly. SpaceX has developed Starship with the intention of lowering launch costs using economies of scale. SpaceX aims to achieve this by reusing both rocket stages by \"catching\" them with the launch tower's systems, increasing payload mass to orbit, increasing launch frequency, mass-manufacturing the rockets and adapting it to a wide range of space missions. Starship is the latest project in SpaceX's reusable launch system development program and plan to colonize Mars.\nStarship's two stages are the Super Heavy booster and the Starship spacecraft. Both stages are equipped with Raptor engines, the first mass-produced full-flow staged combustion cycle engines, which burn liquid methane (natural gas) and liquid oxygen. The main structure is made from a special stainless steel alloy that SpaceX has dubbed \"30X\".\nAs of 2024, Starship is in development with an iterative and incremental approach, involving test flights of prototype vehicles. As a successor to SpaceX's Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets, Starship is intended to perform a wide range of space missions. For missions to further destinations, such as geosynchronous orbit, the Moon, and Mars, Starship will rely on orbital refueling; a ship-to-ship propellant transfer demonstration is expected to occur in 2025. SpaceX also plans other versions of the Starship spacecraft, such as: cargo (deploying SpaceX's second-generation Starlink satellite constellation), and human spaceflight (the Human Landing System variant will land astronauts on the Moon as part of the Artemis program, starting in 2026).","content":"#Description\n##Super Heavy booster\n###Tanks\n###Propulsion\n###Interstage\n##Starship spacecraft\n###Heat shield\n###Variants\n##Raptor engine\n#Versions\n##Block 1\n##Block 2\n##Block 3\n#Planned launch and landing profile\n#Development\n##Early design concepts (2012–2019)\n##Low-altitude flight tests (2019–2021)\n###Starhopper to SN6\n###SN8 to SN15\n##Integrated flight tests (2023–)\n###First flight test\n###Second flight test\n###Third flight test\n###Fourth flight test\n###Fifth flight test\n###Sixth flight test\n#Cost and funding\n#Launch history\n#Potential missions\n##Starlink\n##Artemis Program\n##Astronomy\n##Rocket cargo\n##Mars Sample Return\n##Other missions\n#Potential use cases\n##Space science\n##Transportation\n##Space colonization\n#Facilities\n##Testing and manufacturing\n##Launch sites\n###Starbase\n###Florida\n#Responses to Starship development\n#Notes\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Born_Pink","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Born_Pink","summary":"Born Pink is the second studio album by South Korean girl group Blackpink. It was released on September 16, 2022, through YG Entertainment and Interscope Records. It marked the group's first full-length record since The Album in 2020. Production of the album was handled by various producers including Teddy Park, 24, Freddy Wexler, Nohc, and Paro. Blackpink conceived Born Pink as \"the essence\" of the group, taking inspiration from hip-hop and combining various genres.\nBorn Pink's English-heavy sound draws mostly from pop, hip-hop, rock, and EDM, with melodies characterized by more uptempo production than in its predecessor The Album. The songs incorporate eclectic styles ranging from disco and bubblegum pop to pop-rock and stadium rock. Lyrically, the album discusses themes of love, self-confidence, self-encouragement, dealing with fame and detractors, and more. Blackpink members Jisoo and Rosé co-wrote the fourth track \"Yeah Yeah Yeah\".\nBorn Pink was supported by two singles, both of which reached number one on the Billboard Global 200. The pre-release single \"Pink Venom\" topped the national charts of 10 countries, peaking at number two on South Korea's Circle Digital Chart and at number 22 on the US Billboard Hot 100. The album's second single \"Shut Down\" peaked at number three on the Circle Digital Chart and at number 25 on the Billboard Hot 100. \"Ready for Love\", previously released as a promotional single in collaboration with battle royale video game PUBG Mobile, was also included on the tracklist. To promote the album, Blackpink embarked on the Born Pink World Tour beginning in October.\nThe album was met with generally favorable reviews from critics. The album's stronger production and more personal lyrics received praise; however, criticisms were made for its lack of innovation and musical development. Commercially, it debuted at number one on the Circle Album Chart with 2.2 million copies sold in less than two days, becoming the best-selling album by a female act in South Korea and the first to surpass two million sales. In the United States, it became the first album by a female group to reach number one on the Billboard 200 since Danity Kane in 2008. Additionally, Born Pink became the first album by a K-pop girl group to land atop the Billboard 200 and the UK Albums Chart, which earned Blackpink two Guinness World Records. The album has since been certified double million by the Korea Music Content Association (KMCA). According to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), the album was the eighth best-selling album worldwide across all formats in 2022, and the seventh best-selling album in pure sales.","content":"#Background\n#Recording and development\n#Music and lyrics\n##Composition\n##Songs\n#Promotion and release\n##Marketing\n##Tour\n#Artwork and packaging\n#Critical reception\n##Year-end lists\n#Awards and nominations\n#Commercial performance\n#Track listing\n#Personnel\n#Charts\n#Certifications and sales\n#Release history\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

He is best known for being one of the main orchestrators of the September 11 attacks.\nAl-Zawahiri graduated from Cairo University with a degree in medicine and a master's degree in surgery and was a surgeon by profession. He became a leading figure in the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, an Egyptian Islamist organization, and eventually attained the rank of emir. He was imprisoned from 1981 to 1984 for his role in the assassination of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat. His actions against the Egyptian government, including his planning of the 1995 attack on the Egyptian Embassy in Pakistan, resulted in him being sentenced to death in absentia during the 1999 \"Returnees from Albania\" trial.\nA close associate of al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, al-Zawahiri held significant sway over the group's operations. He was wanted by the United States and the United Nations, respectively, for his role in the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania and in the 2002 Bali bombings. He merged the Egyptian Islamic Jihad with al-Qaeda in 2001 and formally became bin Laden's deputy in 2004. He succeeded bin Laden as al-Qaeda's leader after bin Laden's death in 2011.

Following a loss by home side Arema to their rivals Persebaya Surabaya, around 3,000 Arema supporters invaded the pitch. Police said that the rioting supporters attacked the players and the team officials. The police attempted to protect the players and stop the riot, but the crowds clashed with security forces. In response, riot police units deployed tear gas, which triggered a stampede of people in the stadium trying to escape the gas. A crush formed at one exit, resulting in fans being asphyxiated.\nAs of 24 October, 2022, 135 people had lost their lives, and 583 others were injured as a result of the accident. The disaster is the second deadliest in the history of association football worldwide, after the 1964 Estadio Nacional disaster in Peru which killed 328 people.

The second golden age (2002–2010) is widely considered to have been the most successful period in the club's history, as the club became the only sports club from Cyprus to have won a European trophy, having won the FIBA Europe Regional Challenge Cup in 2003.

Overall, the club has participated in 55 competitive finals both domestically and internationally, from which it has won a total of 37 major trophies, consisting of 13 Basket League titles, 9 Cypriot Cups, 8 Super Cups, 1 FIBA Europe Challenge Cup, 4 Division B titles and 2 Division B Cups.\nFrom the 2003–04 season until the 2009–10 season, AEL managed to advance to at least the knockout phase of the FIBA EuroChallenge in each season, with the 2008 and 2009 seasons being of particular note, as the club qualified for the Final Four phase of the tournament, finishing in 3rd and 4th place respectively. During these successful campaigns, AEL also managed to defeat several well-established European sides such as, Fenerbahçe, Virtus Bologna, ASVEL, PAOK BC, Real Betis, Bandırma B.İ.K., BC Spartak Saint Petersburg, PBC Lokomotiv Kuban, Paris Basket Racing, PBC Ural Great, Azovmash Mariupol, G.S.

{"title":"Eureka_Rebellion","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Eureka_Rebellion","summary":"The Eureka Rebellion was a series of events involving gold miners who revolted against the British administration of the colony of Victoria, Australia during the Victorian gold rush. It culminated in the Battle of the Eureka Stockade, which took place on 3 December 1854 at Ballarat between the rebels and the colonial forces of Australia. The fighting resulted in an official total of 27 deaths and many injuries, the majority of casualties being rebels. There was a preceding period beginning in 1851 of peaceful demonstrations and civil disobedience on the Victorian goldfields. The miners had various grievances, chiefly the cost of mining permits and the officious way the system was enforced.\nTensions began in 1851, with the introduction of a tax on gold mines. Miners began to organize and protest the taxes; miners stopped paying the taxes en masse. The October 1854 murder of a gold miner, and the burning of a local hotel (which miners blamed on the government), ended the previously peaceful nature of the miner's dispute. Open rebellion broke out on November 29, 1854, as a crowd of some 10,000 swore allegiance to the Eureka Flag. Gold miner Peter Lalor became the rebellions de facto leader, as he had initiated the swearing of allegiance. The Battle of Eureka Stockade ended the short-lived rebellion on December 3. A group of 13 captured rebels (not including Lalor, who was in hiding) was put on trial for high treason in Melbourne, but mass public support led to their acquittal.\nThe legacy of the Rebellion is contested. Rebel leader Peter Lalor was elected to the parliament in 1856, though he proved to be less of an ally to the common man than expected. Several reforms sought by the rebels were subsequently implemented, including legislation providing for universal adult male suffrage for Legislative Assembly elections and the removal of property qualifications for Legislative Assembly members. The Eureka Rebellion is controversially identified with the birth of democracy in Australia and interpreted by many as a political revolt.","content":"#Origins in the Victorian gold rush\n##Protests on the goldfields: 1851–1854\n###La Trobe introduces monthly mining tax as protests begin\n###First gold commissioner arrives in Ballarat\n###Bendigo Petition and the Red Ribbon Movement\n###Legislative Council calls for Commission of Inquiry\n###Hotham replaces La Trobe\n#Tensions escalate\n##Murder of James Scobie and the burning of the Eureka hotel\n##Ballarat Reform League meetings\n##Escalating violence as military convoy looted\n#Open rebellion\n##Paramilitary mobilisation and swearing allegiance to the Southern Cross\n###Fortification of the Eureka lead\n####Vinegar Hill blunder: Irish dimension factors in dwindling numbers at stockade\n####Departing detachment of Independent Californian Rangers leaves small garrison behind\n##Battle of the Eureka Stockade\n#Aftermath\n##Trials for sedition and high treason\n##Commission of Inquiry report\n##Peter Lalor enters parliament\n#Location of Bakery Hill and the Eureka Stockade\n#Political legacy\n#Commemoration\n##19th century\n##20th century\n##21st century\n#Popular culture\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#Further reading\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

In 2011, she left Germany to live in London and Paris before relocating to New York City in 2013, where she interned for the French fashion magazine Purple. Sorokin conceived of a private members' club and arts foundation, which included leasing a large building to feature pop-up shops and exhibitions by notable artists she met while interning. She later created fake financial documents to substantiate her claims of having a multi-million-euro trust fund, and forged multiple wire transfer confirmations. Sorokin used these documents, as well as fraudulent checks, to trick banks, acquaintances, and realtors into paying out cash and granting large loans without collateral. She used this to fund her lavish lifestyle, including residencies in multiple upscale hotels. Between 2013 and 2017, Sorokin defrauded and deceived major financial institutions, banks, hotels, and individuals.\nIn 2017, the NYPD arrested Sorokin in a sting operation with the help of her former friend, Rachel DeLoache Williams, who accused Sorokin of defrauding her of $62,000. In 2019, a New York state court convicted Sorokin of attempted grand larceny, larceny in the second degree, and theft of services, and she was sentenced to 4 to 12 years in prison. After serving two years she was released on parole. Six weeks later she was taken into the custody of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for deportation to Germany. On 5 October 2022, Sorokin was granted a $10,000 bail bond and released from jail.\nSorokin's story gained publicity when Williams wrote a lengthy article in Vanity Fair about her experiences with Sorokin in 2018. She expanded on the story in her 2019 book My Friend Anna. The same year, journalist Jessica Pressler wrote an article for New York about Sorokin's life as a socialite; Netflix paid Sorokin $320,000 for the rights to her story and developed it into the 2022 miniseries Inventing Anna. Sorokin's life story has been the subject of multiple other television shows, interviews, podcasts, and theater productions.","content":"#Early life\n#Fraud\n#Indictment and arrest\n#Trial, conviction, and sentence\n#ICE custody\n#Media representation\n#After prison\n##Art shows\n##Non-fungible tokens\n##Fashion\n#Personal life\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Hypoxia_(medicine)","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hypoxia_(medicine)","summary":"Hypoxia is a condition in which the body or a region of the body is deprived of adequate oxygen supply at the tissue level. Hypoxia may be classified as either generalized, affecting the whole body, or local, affecting a region of the body. Although hypoxia is often a pathological condition, variations in arterial oxygen concentrations can be part of the normal physiology, for example, during strenuous physical exercise.\nHypoxia differs from hypoxemia and anoxemia, in that hypoxia refers to a state in which oxygen present in a tissue or the whole body is insufficient, whereas hypoxemia and anoxemia refer specifically to states that have low or no oxygen in the blood. Hypoxia in which there is complete absence of oxygen supply is referred to as anoxia.\nHypoxia can be due to external causes, when the breathing gas is hypoxic, or internal causes, such as reduced effectiveness of gas transfer in the lungs, reduced capacity of the blood to carry oxygen, compromised general or local perfusion, or inability of the affected tissues to extract oxygen from, or metabolically process, an adequate supply of oxygen from an adequately oxygenated blood supply.\nGeneralized hypoxia occurs in healthy people when they ascend to high altitude, where it causes altitude sickness leading to potentially fatal complications: high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) and high altitude cerebral edema (HACE).  Hypoxia also occurs in healthy individuals when breathing inappropriate mixtures of gases with a low oxygen content, e.g., while diving underwater, especially when using malfunctioning closed-circuit rebreather systems that control the amount of oxygen in the supplied air. Mild, non-damaging intermittent hypoxia is used intentionally during altitude training to develop an athletic performance adaptation at both the systemic and cellular level.\nHypoxia is a common complication of preterm birth in newborn infants. Because the lungs develop late in pregnancy, premature infants frequently possess underdeveloped lungs. To improve blood oxygenation, infants at risk of hypoxia may be placed inside incubators that provide warmth, humidity, and supplemental oxygen. More serious cases are treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).","content":"#Classification\n##By cause\n##By extent\n###Generalized hypoxia\n###Localized hypoxia\n###By affected tissues and organs\n####Cerebral hypoxia\n####Corneal hypoxia\n####Intrauterine hypoxia\n####Tumor hypoxia\n####Vestibular system\n#Signs and symptoms\n##Complications\n#Causes\n##Ischemia\n##Hypoxemic hypoxia\n###Carbon monoxide poisoning\n###Altitude\n###Hypoxic breathing gases\n###Other\n##Anemia\n##Histotoxic hypoxia\n#Mechanism\n##Physiological responses\n##Acute\n##Chronic\n##Pathological responses\n###Cerebral ischemia\n###Myocardial ischemia\n###Tumor angiogenesis\n#Diagnosis\n##Physical examination and history\n##Tests\n##Differential diagnosis\n#Prevention\n##Prevention of altitude induced hypoxia\n#Treatment and management\n##Treatment of acute and chronic cases\n#Outcomes\n#Epidemiology\n##Silent hypoxia\n#History\n##Etymology\n#See also\n#Notes\n","lang":"en"}

Produced by Walt Disney Pictures, Depth of Field and ImageMovers, this film is a live-action remake of Walt Disney's 1940 animated film Pinocchio, which is itself based on the 1883 Italian book The Adventures of Pinocchio by Carlo Collodi. It stars Tom Hanks, Cynthia Erivo, and Luke Evans with Benjamin Evan Ainsworth, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Keegan-Michael Key, and Lorraine Bracco in voice roles. The reimagined story follows a wooden puppet named Pinocchio (Evan Ainsworth), who is brought to life by a blue fairy (Erivo) after being crafted by an old Italian woodcarver named Geppetto (Hanks). While the role of Pinocchio's conscience Jiminy Cricket (Gordon-Levitt) attempts to guide Pinocchio in matters of right and wrong, Pinocchio encounters a host of unsavory characters in his efforts to become a real boy.\nDevelopment of the live-action Pinocchio began in 1985, with Jim Henson and Steve Barron approached with the idea, but Disney turned down the project. Disney eventually announced the remake film in April 2015 with Peter Hedges being reported to be writing the film's script, before being replaced with Weitz in May 2017, who also went on to produce. Sam Mendes and Paul King were originally considered for directing, and Zemeckis was confirmed as director in January 2020. By November 2018, it was reported that Hanks was in early talks to play Geppetto; he passed on the project after King's departure but rejoined in August 2020. The main cast was announced in January and March 2021. Principal photography began in March 2021 before finishing the following month. Alan Silvestri, who has collaborated in all of Zemeckis's films, composed the score, who also wrote the new songs with Glen Ballard.\nPinocchio was released on September 8, 2022, by Disney+, as an original film and as part of Disney+ Day. It received generally negative reviews from critics and received six Golden Raspberry Award nominations.","content":"#Plot\n#Cast\n#Production\n##Development\n##Casting\n##Filming\n##Visual effects and animation\n#Music\n#Marketing\n#Release\n#Reception\n##Audience viewership\n##Critical response\n#Accolades\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

Ezra Miller stars as Barry, who travels back in time to prevent his mother's death and becomes stranded in an alternate past. Sasha Calle also stars in her film debut, alongside Michael Shannon, Ron Livingston, Maribel Verdú, Kiersey Clemons, Antje Traue, and Michael Keaton.\nDevelopment of a film based on the Flash began in the late 1980s, with multiple writers and directors attached to the project through 2014. The film was then redeveloped as a part of the DCEU, with Miller cast as the title character. Multiple directors were attached to the film over the following years, with Seth Grahame-Smith, Rick Famuyiwa, and the duo of Daley and Goldstein all departing the project over creative differences. Muschietti and Hodson joined the film in July 2019, and pre-production began in January 2020. The film is influenced by the comic book storyline Flashpoint (2011) and features other DC characters, such as Calle's Supergirl and multiple versions of Batman, including Keaton's portrayal from Batman (1989) and Batman Returns (1992). Filming took place from April to October 2021 at Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden and on location around the United Kingdom.\nThe Flash premiered at Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on June 12, 2023, and was released by Warner Bros. Pictures in the United States on June 16, following multiple delays caused by the director changes and the COVID-19 pandemic. The film received mixed reviews from critics, who praised its humor, action sequences, and the performances, but criticized the visual effects and third act. It was also a box-office bomb, grossing $271.3 million worldwide against a budget of $200–220 million. Its box office performance was attributed to factors such as Miller's legal issues and controversies, the franchise's imminent reboot with the DC Universe (DCU), an overall decline of the superhero genre, and the film's mixed reception and marketing practices.","content":"#Plot\n#Cast\n#Production\n##Development\n###Early attempts\n###DC Extended Universe\n##Pre-production\n##Filming\n##Post-production\n#Music\n#Marketing\n#Release\n##Theatrical\n##Home media\n#Reception\n##Box office\n##Critical response\n##Accolades\n#Future\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

The second named storm of the 2022 Atlantic hurricane season, it originated from a strong tropical wave that moved off the west coast of Africa on June 23. Moving with little development despite favorable conditions, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) started advisories on it as Potential Tropical Cyclone Two late on June 27, due to its imminent threat to land. The disturbance finally organized into Tropical Storm Bonnie at 13:15 UTC on July 1, and made brief landfalls on the Costa Rica–Nicaragua border with winds of  50 miles per hour (80 km\/h). It later became the fourth named storm, third hurricane, and first major hurricane of the 2022 Pacific hurricane season after crossing Nicaragua and Costa Rica from east to west on July 2 and intensifying to a Category 3 hurricane on July 5. Bonnie rapidly weakened, dissipating over the North Pacific.\nBonnie was the first of two tropical cyclones in 2022 to cross from the Atlantic to the Pacific, the second being Hurricane Julia. At least 3,572 individuals were evacuated in Costa Rica. Heavy rains led to flooding and numerous mudslides, with 40 homes flooded in Trinidad and Tobago. A total of 5 people were killed, and damage was estimated at $25 million.","content":"#Meteorological history\n#Preparations and impacts\n##Trinidad and Tobago\n##Mexico\n##Elsewhere\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

The match was played at Lusail Stadium in Lusail, Qatar, on 18 December 2022, the Qatari National Day, and was contested by Argentina and defending champions France. With a record 1.5 billion people watching on television, the final became one of the most widely watched televised sporting events in history.\nThe tournament comprised hosts Qatar and 31 other teams who emerged victorious from the qualification phase, organised by the six FIFA confederations. The 32 teams competed in a group stage, from which 16 teams qualified for the knockout stage. En route to the final, Argentina finished first in Group C, first losing to Saudi Arabia 2–1, then defeating both Mexico and Poland 2–0. They then beat Australia 2–1 in the round of 16, the Netherlands in the quarter-final through a penalty shoot-out after it ended 2–2 in extra time and Croatia in the semi-final 3–0. France finished first in Group D with two wins and one loss (4–1 win over Australia, 2–1 win over Denmark, and a 1–0 loss to Tunisia), defeating Poland 3–1 in the round of 16, England 2–1 in the quarter-final and Morocco 2–0 in the semi-final. The final took place in front of 88,966 spectators and was refereed by Szymon Marciniak.\nArgentina took the lead through a penalty by Lionel Messi in the 23rd minute before Ángel Di María further increased their lead in the 36th minute with a low shot into the corner of the goal after a sweeping Argentina counterattack. France failed to register a shot at the goal for the vast majority of the match until a 97-second brace by Kylian Mbappé tied the game 2–2 in the 81st minute. During extra time, Messi then scored again to give Argentina a 3–2 lead. However, Mbappé scored a second penalty to tie the game 3–3 with only minutes remaining, becoming the second man to score a hat-trick in a World Cup final after Geoff Hurst in 1966. Argentina then won the ensuing penalty shoot-out 4–2 to win their third World Cup, and first since 1986.\nIt was the second time that Argentina reached the World Cup final after losing their opening match (the other occasion being in 1990), a feat three other teams have achieved (West Germany in 1982, Italy in 1994, and Spain in 2010); it was only the second time in history that a team went on to win the tournament after losing their opening match (following Spain in 2010). France became the first team in history to score three goals in a World Cup final and lose.

{"title":"Hurricane_Hilary","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hurricane_Hilary","summary":"Hurricane Hilary was a large and powerful Pacific hurricane in August 2023 that brought torrential rainfall and gusty winds to the Pacific Coast of Mexico, the Baja California Peninsula, and the Southwestern United States, resulting in widespread flooding and mudslides. The cyclone was the eighth named storm, sixth hurricane, and fourth major hurricane of the 2023 Pacific hurricane season. Hilary originated from a tropical wave south of Mexico on August 16, and strengthened into a hurricane a day later while paralleling the southwest coast of Mexico. The hurricane underwent rapid intensification, reaching maximum sustained winds of 140 mph (220 km\/h) and a central pressure of 940 mbar (27.76 inHg) on August 18, making it a Category 4 on the Saffir-Simpson scale. After environmental conditions became unfavorable, Hilary weakened as it approached land, making landfall on August 20 as a tropical storm in San Quintín along the western Baja California peninsula. Hilary became a post-tropical cyclone over land, before being absorbed into a new non-tropical low-pressure area early on August 21.\nThe threat from Hurricane Hilary prompted widespread and varied preparations. In Mexico, thousands of people evacuated to shelters as ports closed along the coast. In anticipation of \"catastrophic and life-threatening flooding\", the National Hurricane Center (NHC) issued its first-ever tropical storm warning for Southern California, extending from the Mexico–United States border to just north of Los Angeles. The Weather Prediction Center and various National Weather Service offices issued forecasts related to the rainfall potential, affecting about 26 million people across Arizona, California, Nevada, and Utah.\nIn Mexico, the hurricane killed three people and left at least 250 million pesos (US$14.7 million) in damage. Power outages affected 315,929 people in the country, although most service was restored within four days. The storm left behind flooded roads, mudslides and downed trees in the Baja California peninsula and in Southern California. Some areas of the latter region received up to 600% of their annual rainfall averages for the month of August. The floods killed one person in San Bernardino County, California. The estimated damage total in the United States was US$900 million, much of it in Inyo County, California, where most of the roads in Death Valley National Park were damaged by floods. The park was closed for two months, its longest ever closure. Hilary broke records in four U.S. states for wettest tropical cyclone or its remnants.","content":"#Meteorological history\n#Preparations\n##Mexico\n##United States\n#Impact\n##Mexico\n##United States\n###California\n###Elsewhere\n#Aftermath\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

Sharma's comment was in reference to an account from Sahih al-Bukhari that Muhammad (aged 53) married Aisha when she was six-years old, and the marriage was consummated when Aisha was nine. The controversy escalated on 1 June, when Naveen Kumar Jindal, the Delhi BJP media chief, made similar remarks on Twitter. By 4 June, the remarks had been widely shared on social media, and were trending among the top 10 hashtags in all the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and Turkey. On the contrary, they were defended by right-wing politicians in Europe, like Geert Wilders, who cited Sharma's right to freedom of speech.\n\nThe comments were strongly condemned by Muslim nations. Within India, dozens of police cases were filed against Sharma and Jindal. In some parts of the country, protests turned violent, leading to several deaths and injuries. The violence in Uttar Pradesh led to the punitive demolition of homes of some accused rioters.\nSeveral Gulf countries, including allies and partners of India, issued strong condemnations and there were threats of boycotting Indian goods. The Indian government responded to the controversy, by stating that the remarks did not reflect the government's views, but rather came from \"fringe elements\". BJP suspended Sharma and expelled Jindal from the party.","content":"#Background\n#Comments about Muhammad\n#Police cases\n#Protests and violence\n##Uttar Pradesh\n##Ranchi\n##Howrah\n##Maharashtra\n##Udaipur\n##Kabul\n#International reactions\n##Qatar\n##Other Arab states\n##Other countries\n##Organisation of Islamic Cooperation\n#Indian government response\n#BJP response\n#See also\n","lang":"en"}

Founded in 1889, it is one of the oldest football clubs in Asia. The club competes in the Indian Super League, the top tier of Indian football league system. The club is most notable for its victory over the East Yorkshire Regiment in the 1911 IFA Shield final. This victory made Mohun Bagan the first all-Indian club to win a championship over a British club and was a major moment during India's push for independence.\nThe club is commonly referred to as Mohun Bagan and had several sponsored names. In 2020, KGSPL, the company that owned ATK, took an 80% stake in the football division of Mohun Bagan alongside dissolving its own club. This disbanded club was absorbed into the football division of Mohun Bagan and Mohun Bagan was rebranded as ATK Mohun Bagan FC. In 2023, the team was rebranded as Mohun Bagan Super Giant after continuous protest from the fans and i.e., how the term ATK was removed from the club's name and from that the historic club is again playing with its own name of Mohun Bagan.\nTill now the club has won the top-flight football league a record six times — Indian Super League once, I-League twice and National Football League thrice. They are one of the most successful Indian clubs in the history of the Federation Cup, having won the championship a record 14 times. The club had also won several other trophies, including the ISL playoffs (1 time), the Durand Cup (17 times), the IFA Shield (22 times), the Rovers Cup (14 times) and the Calcutta Football League (30 times).\n\nThe club annually contests in Asia's oldest rivalry, the Kolkata Derby against its long-time local rival East Bengal, with the first derby match being played on 8 August 1921. Mohun Bagan was one of the founding members of National Football League in 1996 and has never been relegated from the top-tier league of the country.

They initially lasted from 4–7 August 2022 and involved live-fire drills, air sorties, naval deployments, and ballistic missile launches by the People's Liberation Army (PLA). The exercises started in response to US Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan.\nThe exercises, which drew criticism from the G7 nations, were a show of force intended to deter what the PRC perceives as US involvement in “internal Chinese affairs” and to demonstrate Chinese military power in the region for both international and domestic audiences. The live-fire drills were unprecedented in recent history and took place in six zones that surrounded the island's busiest international waterways and aviation routes. On 8 August, China's military announced new military exercises around Taiwan. China announced an end to the exercises on 10 August, but also stated that regular \"patrols\" would be launched in the Taiwan Strait.","content":"#Background\n##Incursions into Taiwan ADIZ\n##Escalation of tensions\n#Military exercises\n#Reactions\n##Japan\n##North Korea\n##Russia\n##United States\n#Aftermath\n#See also\n","lang":"en"}

Estimates of the U.S. population in this cohort range from 30 million to 48 million. \nIn early childhood during the September 11 terrorist attacks, they were the first cohort to experience adolescence in a post-9\/11 world. The majority of this cohort came of age during the 2010s, with the U.K. Brexit referendum and U.S. presidential election of 2016, COVID-19 pandemic and the 2020–2021 George Floyd protests being key formative events. Zillennials experienced the sudden global Digital Revolution of the late 2000s and 2010s, navigating mobile LTE internet, cell phones, mobile devices and smartphones.\nZillennials code-switch between generations, have high levels of digital literacy, and are more likely to self-identify into a minority group. Zillennials are less wealthy but more economically secure than Generation Z, commanding relatively high spending power in the U.S. economy, especially when compared to millennials.

{"title":"2022_Karnataka_hijab_row","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2022_Karnataka_hijab_row","summary":"At the beginning of February 2022, a dispute pertaining to school uniforms was reported in the Indian state of Karnataka, when some Muslim students of a junior college who wanted to wear hijab to classes were denied entry on the grounds that it was a violation of the college's uniform policy which was also followed by the other religion students as well. Over the following weeks, the dispute spread to other schools and colleges across the state, with groups of Hindu students staging counter-protests by demanding to wear saffron scarves. On 5 February, the Karnataka government issued an order stating that uniforms must be worn compulsorily where policies exist and no exception can be made for the wearing of the hijab. Several educational institutions cited this order and denied entry to Muslim girls wearing the hijab.\nPetitions were filed in the Karnataka High Court on behalf of the aggrieved students. On 10 February, the High Court issued an interim order restraining all students from wearing any form of religious attire. The order was implemented in all schools and colleges across Karnataka, with students, and in some cases teachers, being asked to remove hijabs and burqas outside the school gates. After a hearing of about 23 hours spread over 11 days, the court delivered its verdict on 15 March 2022, upholding the restrictions on hijab. The court ruled that the hijab is not an essential religious practice in Islam. Y-category security has been provided to the Karnataka High Court judges who delivered the hijab verdict, and two people were arrested for making threatening speeches. After control of the state legislative assembly changed from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to the Indian National Congress in the 2023 election, the new state government rescinded the order in December 2023.\nThe implementation of dress codes by educational institutes, banning the hijab, was criticised inside India and abroad by officials in countries including the United States and Pakistan, by Human Rights Watch, and by figures like Malala Yousafzai.   The ban was defended by politicians such as Arif Mohammad Khan, Aaditya Thackeray, Vishva Hindu Parishad and activist Taslima Nasreen.","content":"#Background\n#Events\n##Udupi dispute\n##Saffron protests\n##Government reaction\n##Fallout\n#Petitions in the High Court\n##Religious rights\n##Government order\n##College development committees\n##Udupi college and other institutions\n#High Court verdict\n#Supreme Court\n#Violence\n#Reactions\n##Domestic\n##International\n##Ministry of External Affairs (MEA)\n#Impact\n#Rescission\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

It developed from the Liberty of Durham, which emerged in the Anglo-Saxon period. The gradual acquisition of powers by the bishops led to Durham being recognised as a palatinate by the late thirteenth century, one of several such counties in England during the Middle Ages. The county palatine had its own government and institutions, which broadly mirrored those of the monarch and included several judicial courts. From the sixteenth century the palatine rights of the bishops were gradually reduced, and were finally abolished in 1836. The last palatine institution to survive was the court of chancery, which was abolished in 1972.\nThe palatine included the contemporary ceremonial county of Durham except southern Teesdale, the parts of Tyne and Wear south of the Tyne, and had exclaves in Northumberland and North Yorkshire around the island of Lindisfarne and the settlements of Bedlington, Norham, and Crayke.","content":"#History\n##Early history\n##Establishment and consolidation\n##Decline and abolition\n#Administration\n##Taxation\n##Government and courts\n#St Cuthbert and the haliwerfolc\n#Legacy\n#References\n##Citations\n","lang":"en"}

(; transl. 'The first [and second] part of the storehouse of images of the more notable men from the beginning of time, with their biographies subjoined, taken in abbreviated form from the most approved authors.'), abbreviated as Promptuarium Iconum Insigniorum, is an iconographic collection of woodcut engravings published in 1553 by Guillaume Rouillé, a French humanist publisher based in Lyon. The work, originally issued in Latin, French, and Italian editions, presents medallion-format portraits of historical and mythical figures accompanied by biographical summaries. Chronologically organized, it spans from Old Testament figures and Greco-Roman deities to mid-16th-century European contemporaries. Each first edition contained 828 portraits, with the 1577 French edition incorporating approximately 100 additional engravings. A Spanish edition followed in 1561.\nThe collection consists of two sections: Prima pars ('First Part'), which encompasses figures predating Christ, and Pars secunda ('Second Part'), which documents individuals from the Christian era forward. While typically published as a single volume, the sections maintain separate pagination systems. The portraits, attributed to Georges Reverdy, derive from widely diverse historical sources and emulate ancient coinage designs, though they lack the numismatic precision necessary for scholarly reference. The publication's commercial success stemmed from Rouillé's deliberate strategy of presenting historical content through accessible illustrations and narratives for general readership. Its influence manifested in numerous European iconographic collections throughout the latter half of the 16th century and into the 17th century.","content":"#Contents\n#Iconographic bases and authorship\n#Publication history\n#Reception\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Silvio_Berlusconi","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Silvio_Berlusconi","summary":"Silvio Berlusconi ( BAIR-luu-SKOH-nee, Italian: [ˈsilvjo berluˈskoːni] ; 29 September 1936 – 12 June 2023) was an Italian media tycoon and politician who served as the prime minister of Italy in four governments from 1994 to 1995, 2001 to 2006 and 2008 to 2011. He was a member of the Chamber of Deputies from 1994 to 2013; a member of the Senate of the Republic from 2022 until his death in 2023, and previously from March to November 2013; and a member of the European Parliament (MEP) from 2019 to 2022, and previously from 1999 to 2001. With a net worth of US$6.8 billion as of June 2023, Berlusconi was the third-wealthiest person in Italy at the time of his death.\nBerlusconi rose into the financial elite of Italy in the late 1960s. He was the controlling shareholder of Mediaset and owned the Italian football club AC Milan from 1986 to 2017. He was nicknamed Il Cavaliere (The Knight) for his Order of Merit for Labour; he voluntarily resigned from this order in March 2014. In 2018, Forbes ranked him as the 190th richest man in the world, with a net worth of US$8 billion. In 2009, Forbes ranked him 12th in the list of the World's Most Powerful People due to his domination of Italian politics throughout more than fifteen years at the head of the centre-right coalition.\nBerlusconi was prime minister for nine years in total, making him the longest serving post-war prime minister of Italy, and the third longest-serving since Italian unification, after Benito Mussolini and Giovanni Giolitti. He was the leader of the centre-right party Forza Italia from 1994 to 2009, and its successor party The People of Freedom from 2009 to 2013. He led the revived Forza Italia from 2013 to 2023. Berlusconi was the senior G8 leader from 2009 until 2011, and he held the record for hosting G8 summits (having hosted three summits in Italy). After serving nearly 19 years as a member of the Chamber of Deputies, the country's lower house, he became a member of the Senate following the 2013 Italian general election.\nOn 1 August 2013, Berlusconi was convicted of tax fraud by the Supreme Court of Cassation. His four-year prison sentence was confirmed, and he was banned from holding public office for two years. Aged 76, he was exempted from direct imprisonment, and instead served his sentence by doing unpaid community service. Three years of his sentence was automatically pardoned under Italian law; because he had been sentenced to gross imprisonment for more than two years, he was banned from holding legislative office for six years and expelled from the Senate. Berlusconi pledged to stay leader of Forza Italia throughout his custodial sentence and public office ban. After his ban ended, Berlusconi ran for and was elected as an MEP at the 2019 European Parliament election. He returned to the Senate after winning a seat in the 2022 Italian general election, then died the following year from complications of chronic leukaemia, and was given a state funeral.\nBerlusconi was known for his populist political style and brash personality. In his long tenure, he was often accused of being an authoritarian leader and a strongman. At the height of his power, Berlusconi was the richest person in Italy, owned three of the main TV channels of the country, and indirectly controlled RAI through his own government. He was the owner of Italy's biggest publishing company, several newspapers and magazines, and one of the largest football clubs in Europe. At the time of his death, The Guardian wrote that Berlusconi \"gathered himself more power than was ever wielded by one individual in a Western democracy\". Berlusconi remained a controversial figure who divided public opinion and political analysts. Supporters emphasised his leadership skills and charismatic power, his fiscal policy based on tax reduction, and his ability to maintain strong and close foreign relations with both the United States and Russia. In general, critics address his performance as a politician and the ethics of his government practices in relation to his business holdings. Issues with the former include accusations of having mismanaged the state budget and of increasing the Italian government debt. The second criticism concerns his vigorous pursuit of his personal interests while in office, including benefitting from his own companies' growth due to policies promoted by his governments, having vast conflicts of interest due to ownership of a media empire, and being blackmailed as a leader because of his turbulent private life.","content":"#Family background and personal life\n#Business career\n##Milano Due\n##TeleMilano\n##Fininvest\n#Political career\n##Beginnings\n##1994 electoral victory\n##Fall of the Berlusconi I Cabinet\n##2001 electoral victory\n##Berlusconi II Cabinet\n##Subsequent elections\n##Berlusconi III Cabinet\n##Attempt to reform the Italian constitution\n##2006 general election and opposition\n##2008 electoral victory\n##The People of Freedom split\n##Resignation\n##2013 general election\n##Refoundation of Forza Italia and public office ban\n##Political comeback and election to European Parliament and Senate\n#Foreign policy\n##Relations with Russia\n##Relations with Israel\n##Relations with Belarus\n##Cooperation with the Western Balkans\n##Relations with Libya\n#Berlusconism\n##Political positions\n##Comparisons to other leaders\n#Legal problems\n#Controversies\n##Economic conflicts of interest\n##Media control and conflict of interest\n##The Economist\n##Legislative changes\n##Accusations of links to the Mafia\n##Remarks on Western civilisation and Islam\n##Right-to-die case\n##Anti-immigration laws\n##Jokes, gestures, and blunders\n##Friendship with Bettino Craxi\n##Freedom Army\n##Wiretaps and accusations of corruption\n##Divorce and allegations of sexual misconduct\n###Shots of Porto Rotondo\n##Rubygate\n##Panama Papers\n#Health\n#Death\n#Personal fortune\n#Electoral history\n##First-past-the-post elections\n#Works by Silvio Berlusconi\n#Honours and awards\n##Namesakes\n#In films\n##Documentaries\n##Feature films\n#See also\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Levantine_Arabic","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Levantine_Arabic","summary":"Levantine Arabic, also called Shami (autonym: ‏شامي‎ šāmi or اللهجة الشامية el-lahje š-šāmiyye), is an Arabic variety spoken in the Levant, namely in Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, Israel and southern Turkey (historically only in Adana, Mersin and Hatay provinces). With over 54 million speakers, Levantine is, alongside Egyptian, one of the two prestige varieties of spoken Arabic comprehensible all over the Arab world.\nLevantine is not officially recognized in any state or territory. Although it is the majority language in Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, and Syria, it is predominantly used as a spoken vernacular in daily communication, whereas most written and official documents and media in these countries use the official Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), a form of literary Arabic only acquired through formal education that does not function as a native language. In Israel and Turkey, Levantine is a minority language.\nThe Palestinian dialect is the closest vernacular Arabic variety to MSA, with about 50% of common words. Nevertheless, Levantine and MSA are not mutually intelligible. Levantine speakers therefore often call their language ‏العامية‎ al-ʿāmmiyya , 'slang', 'dialect', or 'colloquial'. However, with the emergence of social media, attitudes toward Levantine have improved. The amount of written Levantine has significantly increased, especially online, where Levantine is written using Arabic, Latin, or Hebrew characters. Levantine pronunciation varies greatly along social, ethnic, and geographical lines. Its grammar is similar to that shared by most vernacular varieties of Arabic. Its lexicon is overwhelmingly Arabic, with a significant Aramaic influence.\nThe lack of written sources in Levantine makes it impossible to determine its history before the modern period. Aramaic was the dominant language in the Levant starting in the 1st millennium BCE; it coexisted with other languages, including many Arabic dialects spoken by various Arab tribes. With the Muslim conquest of the Levant in the 7th century, new Arabic speakers from the Arabian Peninsula settled in the area, and a lengthy language shift from Aramaic to vernacular Arabic occurred.","content":"#Naming and classification\n#Geographical distribution and varieties\n##Dialects\n##Ethnicity and religion\n##Speakers by country\n#History\n##Pre-Islamic antiquity\n##Muslim conquest of the Levant\n##Medieval and early modern era\n##20th and 21st centuries\n#Status and usage\n##Diglossia and code-switching\n##Education\n##Films and music\n##Written media\n#Phonology\n#Orthography and writing systems\n#Grammar\n##Nouns and noun phrases\n##Pronouns\n##Verbs and verb phrases\n###Root and verb forms\n###Regular verb conjugation\n###Compound tenses\n###Passive voice\n###Negation\n#Vocabulary\n#Sample text\n#Notes\n#References\n#Sources\n#Further reading\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Cyclone_Batsirai","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cyclone_Batsirai","summary":"Intense Tropical Cyclone Batsirai was a deadly tropical cyclone which heavily impacted Madagascar in February 2022, becoming the strongest tropical cyclone to strike Madagascar since Cyclone Enawo in 2017. It made landfall two weeks after Tropical Storm Ana brought deadly floods to the island country in late January. The second tropical disturbance, the first tropical cyclone, and the first intense tropical cyclone of the 2021–22 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season, Batsirai originated from a tropical disturbance that was first noted on 24 January 2022. It fluctuated in intensity and became a moderate tropical storm on 27 January 2022, after which it unexpectedly rapidly intensified into an intense tropical cyclone. It then weakened and struggled to intensify through the coming days due to present wind shear and dry air, where it weakened after some time. Afterward, it entered much more favorable conditions, rapidly intensified yet again to a high-end Category 4 cyclone on the Saffir–Simpson scale while moving towards Madagascar. The storm underwent an eyewall replacement cycle the next day, and fluctuated in intensity before making landfall in Madagascar as a Category 3 cyclone, later rapidly weakening due to the mountainous terrain on the island.\nMauritius and Réunion both experienced damage from the storm, though the effects were relatively minor. 123 deaths were reported due to Batsirai, 121 deaths were reported in Madagascar and 2 deaths were reported in Mauritius. As the storm approached, Madagascar prepared recovery supplies, with worries of significant flooding due to the more barren geography of the country. The United Nations supported preparation and relief efforts for after the storm as well, since millions were expected to be affected by it. Batsirai made landfall in the country early on 5 February, and brought heavy impacts and majorly disrupting power and communication throughout the affected areas. Entire towns were devastated, with thousands of structures being damaged or destroyed. After the storm passed, thousands of people evacuated to temporary shelters. Batsirai left at least 112,000 displaced, and 124,000 homes affected. Overall, Cyclone Batsirai caused a total of $190 million in damages throughout the storm's life. The same areas were affected a year later by a more powerful cyclone named Cyclone Freddy.","content":"#Meteorological history\n#Preparations\n##Mauritius\n##Madagascar\n#Impact\n##Mauritius\n##Réunion\n##Madagascar\n#Aftermath\n##Mauritius\n##Madagascar\n###International response\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}
{"title":"QAnon","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/QAnon","summary":"QAnon ( CUE-ə-non, or  CUE-an-on) is a far-right American political conspiracy theory and political movement that originated in 2017. QAnon centers on fabricated claims made by an anonymous individual or individuals known as \"Q\". Those claims have been relayed and developed by online communities and influencers. Their core belief is that a cabal of Satanic, cannibalistic child molesters is operating a global child sex trafficking ring that conspired against president Donald Trump. QAnon has direct roots in Pizzagate, an Internet conspiracy theory that appeared one year earlier, but also incorporates elements of many different conspiracy theories and unifies them into a larger interconnected conspiracy theory. QAnon has been described as a cult.\nFollowers believe the Trump administration secretly fought the cabal of pedophiles, and would conduct arrests and executions of thousands of cabal members on a day known as \"the Storm\" or \"the Event\". QAnon conspiracy believers have named Democratic politicians, Hollywood actors, high-ranking government officials, business tycoons, and medical experts as members of the cabal. QAnon has also claimed that Trump stimulated the conspiracy of Russian interference in the 2016 United States presidential election to enlist Robert Mueller to join him in exposing the sex trafficking ring, and to prevent a coup d'état by Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and George Soros. QAnon is described as antisemitic or rooted in antisemitic tropes, due to its fixation on Jewish financier Soros and conspiracy theories about the Rothschild family, a frequent target of antisemites.\nAlthough it has its origins in older conspiracy theories, the first post by Q was in October 2017 on the website 4chan. Q claimed to be a high-level government official with Q clearance, with access to classified information about the Trump administration and its opponents. Q soon moved to 8chan, making it QAnon's online home. Q's often cryptic posts became known as \"drops\", and were collected by aggregator apps and websites. QAnon became a viral phenomenon beyond the internet and turned into a political movement. QAnon followers began to appear at Trump campaign rallies in August 2018, and Trump amplified QAnon accounts on Twitter. QAnon's conspiracy theories have also been relayed by Russian and Chinese state-backed media, social media troll accounts, and the far-right Falun Gong–associated Epoch Media Group.\nSince its emergence in American politics, QAnon spawned movements around the world. The exact number of QAnon adherents is unclear. After increased scrutiny of the movement, social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook began taking action to stop the spread of the conspiracy theory. QAnon followers have perpetrated acts of violence. Members of the movement took part in the 2020 United States presidential election, during which they supported Trump's campaign and waged information warfare to influence voters. After Joe Biden won, they were involved in efforts to overturn the results of the election. Associates of Trump, such as Michael Flynn, Lin Wood and Sidney Powell, have promoted QAnon-derived conspiracy theories. When these tactics failed, Trump supporters – many of them QAnon followers – attacked the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021. The Capitol attack led to a further, more sustained social media crackdown on the movement and its claims.","content":"#Background\n##Pizzagate\n##Influence of 4chan culture\n##Previous \"anons\"\n#Origin and spread\n##Mainstream attention\n##International following\n##Pastel QAnon\n#Claims\n##Q's posts\n##The cabal and \"the Storm\"\n##Child sex trafficking and satanic sacrifice\n##Other QAnon beliefs\n#Analysis\n##Identity of Q\n###Multiple people\n###Paul Furber and the Watkins family\n##Slogans and vocabulary\n##Derivative elements\n###Christian themes\n###Antisemitism\n##Appeal\n###Disillusionment\n##Demographics\n#Incidents\n##Attempts to overturn the 2020 U.S. election\n##German coup attempt\n#Reactions\n##Media, advocacy groups, and public figures\n##Official responses\n###FBI domestic terrorism assessment\n###Congressional resolution\n##Republican politicians and organizations\n##Connected individuals\n###Donald Trump\n###Mike Pence\n###Michael Flynn\n###Lin Wood\n###Sidney Powell\n###Kelly Townsend\n###Liz Harris\n#Online\n##QDrops app\n##Anti-QAnon subreddits\n##Removal of content\n##Migration to alt-tech\n##Return to Twitter\/X\n#See also\n#Further reading\n#Notes\n#References\n##Bibliography\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"2023_Turkish_presidential_election","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2023_Turkish_presidential_election","summary":"Presidential elections were held in Turkey in May 2023, alongside parliamentary elections, to elect a president for a term of five years. Dubbed the most important election of 2023, \nthe presidential election went to a run-off for the first time in Turkish history. The election had originally been scheduled to take place on 18 June, but the government moved them forward by a month to avoid coinciding with the university exams, the Hajj pilgrimage and the start of the summer holidays. It is estimated that a total of 64 million voters had the right to cast their votes in elections, 60.9 million in Turkey and 3.2 million abroad.\nIncumbent president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan of the Justice and Development Party (AK Party) ran for re-election as the joint candidate of the People's Alliance, which includes the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) and two other smaller parties. The Nation Alliance, composed of six opposition parties including the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), fielded CHP leader Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu as its presidential candidate. Though not part of the alliance, the pro-Kurdish Party of Greens and the Left Future (YSGP) and the Labour and Freedom Alliance (of which it is a member) endorsed Kılıçdaroğlu. Two other minor candidates, namely Homeland Party leader Muharrem İnce and anti-immigration ultranationalist Ancestral Alliance nominee Sinan Oğan, also reached the required 100,000 signatures to stand; however, three days before the election, İnce withdrew from the election citing consistent slander and smear campaigns against him by rival candidates, though he still appeared on ballots.\nThe main campaign issues revolved around the deadly February 2023 Turkey–Syria earthquake, which left over 50,000 people dead and threatened to postpone the election date. The government was criticised by opposition politicians for its slow response to the earthquake and land amnesties prior to it that critics claimed left buildings more vulnerable. The economy also featured prominently due to the rapidly rising cost of living. In most polls, voters identified the economy as their prime area of concern.\nIn the first round Erdoğan and Oğan outperformed expectations to receive 49.5% and 5.2% of the vote respectively, while Kılıçdaroğlu received 44.9% and Muharrem İnce (who remained on the ballot despite withdrawing) 0.4%. As Erdoğan's vote share was 0.5% short of winning outright, he and Kılıçdaroğlu contested a run-off vote on 28 May. Oğan endorsed Erdoğan, while the elements of Ancestral Alliance split their support, as Victory Party leader Ümit Özdağ endorsed Kılıçdaroğlu and My Country Party leader Neşet Doğan endorsed Erdoğan. Erdoğan would be re-elected to a third term with 52.2% of the vote in the runoff.\nThis was incumbent President's Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's eleventh election victory in a row going back to his election as Mayor of Istanbul in 1994. His victory was seen as a continuation of his nearly three-decades dominance over Turkish politics. In contrast, following Kılıçdaroğlu's narrow defeat, he was voted out as the leader of the CHP in November.","content":"#Background\n##2018 elections\n#Date\n##Discussion on snap elections\n##Discussion on postponing election date\n##Election calendar\n#Electoral system\n#Candidates\n##Candidates\n##Nominations\n#Endorsements\n##Parties and alliances\n#Second round\n##Negotiations by Oğan and Özdağ\n###Dissolution of ATA Alliance\n###Endorsement of Erdoğan by Oğan\n###Özdağ's support for Kılıçdaroğlu\n##Erdoğan's strategy\n##Kılıçdaroğlu's strategy\n##Potential debate\n#Controversies\n##Erdoğan's right to seek re-election\n##Political violence\n##Erdoğan's photo on ballot paper\n##Fake videos\n##Block of Ekşi Sözlük\n##Reporting of the results\n##Azerbaijani and Russian interference allegations\n#Opinion polls\n##First round\n##Second round\n#Results\n##Analysis\n#Aftermath\n##Domestic\n##International\n#See also\n#Notes\n","lang":"en"}
{"title":"Clarence_Thomas","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Clarence_Thomas","summary":"Clarence Thomas (born June 23, 1948) is an American lawyer and jurist who serves as an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. He was nominated by President George H. W. Bush to succeed Thurgood Marshall and has served since 1991. After Marshall, Thomas is the second African American to serve on the Supreme Court and has been its longest-serving member since Anthony Kennedy's retirement in 2018. Since Stephen Breyer's retirement in 2022, he is also the Court's oldest member.\nThomas was born in Pin Point, Georgia. After his father abandoned the family, he was raised by his grandfather in a poor Gullah community near Savannah. Growing up as a devout Catholic, Thomas originally intended to be a priest in the Catholic Church but was frustrated over the church's insufficient attempts to combat racism. He abandoned his aspiration of becoming a clergyman to attend the College of the Holy Cross and Yale Law School, where he was influenced by a number of conservative authors, notably Thomas Sowell. Upon graduating, he was appointed as an assistant attorney general in Missouri and later entered private practice there. He became a legislative assistant to U.S. Senator John Danforth in 1979, and was made Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights at the U.S. Department of Education in 1981. President Ronald Reagan appointed Thomas as Chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) the next year.\nPresident George H. W. Bush nominated Thomas to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 1990. He served in that role for 19 months before filling Marshall's seat on the Supreme Court. Thomas's confirmation hearings were bitter and intensely fought, centering on an accusation that he had sexually harassed Anita Hill, a subordinate at the Department of Education and the EEOC. The Senate confirmed Thomas by a vote of 52–48, the narrowest margin in a century.\nSince the death of Antonin Scalia, Thomas has been the Court's foremost originalist, stressing the original meaning in interpreting the Constitution. In contrast to Scalia—who had been the only other consistent originalist—he pursues a more classically liberal variety of originalism. Thomas was known for his silence during most oral arguments, though has since begun asking more questions to counsel. He is notable for his majority opinions in Good News Club v. Milford Central School (determining the freedom of religious speech in relation to the First Amendment) and New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen (affirming the individual right to bear arms outside the home), as well as his dissent in Gonzales v. Raich (arguing that Congress may not criminalize the private cultivation of medical marijuana). He is widely considered to be the Court's most conservative member.","content":"#Early life\n##College of the Holy Cross and Yale Law School\n#Early legal career\n#District of Columbia Court of Appeals\n#Nomination to the Supreme Court\n##Anita Hill accusations\n###Second hearing\n##Senate votes\n#Supreme Court of the United States\n##Government powers and legal structure\n###Court precedent\n###Executive power\n###Federalism and states' rights\n##Individual rights\n###First Amendment\n###Second Amendment\n###Fourth Amendment\n###Sixth Amendment\n###Eighth Amendment\n###Fourteenth Amendment\n###Abortion and family planning\n###LGBTQ rights\n##Oral arguments\n#Personal life\n##Family\n##Religion\n##Literary influences\n##Moira Smith allegations\n##Nondisclosure of finances\n#Honors and recognition\n#In popular culture\n#Writings\n#See also\n#Footnotes\n#References\n##Bibliography\n#Further reading\n#External links\n##Biographical\n","lang":"en"}

Impacted areas include parts of Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, and Ontario, with Buffalo, New York and the Fort Erie and Kingston areas of Ontario experiencing two full days of hazardous conditions and zero-visibility. The cold wave affected all U.S. states from Colorado to the Eastern Seaboard, with effects felt as far south as Miami, Florida. On December 24, 110 million people across 36 states were subject to wind chill alerts.\nThe storm, and its related cold wave, killed at least 100 people, with six additional deaths occurring due to a simultaneous, smaller storm in the Pacific Northwest (British Columbia, Oregon, Washington). 41 of the deaths from the main storm occurred in the Buffalo area where lake-effect snowfall exceeded 56 in (140 cm) over a five-day period, while other deaths from that storm and the cold wave occurred across 17 states and the province of Ontario. The storm caused extensive vehicle pileups and road closures, particularly in the areas affected by blizzards or adjacent to those areas, with a complete driving ban imposed in Buffalo for five-and-a-half days. Due to the storm, more than 18,200 flights were canceled in the U.S. between December 22 and 28, while hundreds more were canceled in Canada. Buffalo Niagara International Airport was the most severely affected, as it was completely shut down for five days. Numerous inter-city passenger rail trips were delayed or canceled in the U.S., while in Ontario, Via Rail service between Toronto and Montreal or Ottawa was completely suspended for over 2 days due to a derailment. About 6.3 million households in the U.S. and 1.1 million in Canada were without power for some part of the storm.\nThe National Weather Service in Buffalo, New York, described it as a \"once-in-a-generation storm\" for Buffalo, and NOAA's Weather Prediction Center stated it was a \"historic arctic outbreak\". Media and New York State Governor Kathy Hochul referred to the situation in the Buffalo area as the Blizzard of the Century.","content":"#Meteorological history\n#Preparations\n#Impact\n##Deaths\n##Infrastructure\n###Flight delays and cancellations\n###Road closures and crashes\n###Intra-city transit disruptions\n###Inter-city train delays and cancellations\n###Energy emergencies\n###Power outages\n##Sports\n##Corporate and institutional closures\n##Animals\n#Post-storm cold wave\n##Rocky Mountain region\n##Central United States\n##Eastern United States\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

The bank was previously the primary subsidiary of SVB Financial Group, a publicly traded bank holding company that had offices in 15 U.S. states and over a dozen international jurisdictions. \nAs a regional bank in the San Francisco Bay Area, SVB offers services specifically designed to meet the needs of the tech industry, and soon became the largest bank by deposits in Silicon Valley and the preferred bank of almost half of all venture-backed tech startups. In March 2023, after central bank–endorsed interest rate hikes during the 2021–2022 inflation spike, there was a bank run on its deposits, which led to its collapse and seizure on March 10, 2023 by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI), its regulator. Citing inadequate liquidity and insolvency, state officials at the DFPI appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) receiver of the bank. This was, at the time, the second-largest bank failure in U.S. history, later surpassed by the collapse of First Republic Bank during the March 2023 United States bank failures.\nOn March 12, 2023, a joint statement was issued by Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, and FDIC Chairman Martin Gruenberg, stating that all depositors at SVB would be fully protected and would have access to both insured and uninsured deposits starting the following Monday, March 13. The FDIC then established a bridge bank successor, Silicon Valley Bridge Bank, N.A., which quickly assumed ongoing business. On March 27, 2023, First Citizens Bank & Trust Company, a subsidiary of First Citizens BancShares, assumed all customer deposits and acquired all loans of Silicon Valley Bridge Bank from the FDIC and began operating all SVB branches.","content":"#Foundation and early growth\n#Expansion\n#Operations in lead-up to collapse\n##Business model\n##Facilities\n##Affiliations and community involvement\n#Collapse\n#References\n##Works cited\n#Further reading\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

It was launched in 2014 and is broadcast on Star Sports. It is the most popular kabaddi league in the world. It is also the second most watched sports league in India after the Indian Premier League (IPL). Puneri Paltan are the current champions of PKL.\nThe league's inception was influenced by the popularity of the kabaddi tournament at the 2006 Asian Games. The format of the competition was influenced by IPL. The Pro Kabaddi League uses a franchise-based model and its first season was held in 2014 with eight teams each of which has paid fees of up to US$250,000 to join.\nThere were doubts over whether the Pro Kabaddi League would be successful, noting that many leagues were attempting to emulate the IPL's business model and success and that, unlike cricket, there were relatively fewer well-known players in Kabaddi. However, it was also noted that kabaddi was widely played in grassroots community settings, and could thus attract a wide variety of rural and metropolitan viewers for advertisers to target if the league gained significant attraction.\nThe inaugural season was seen by 43.5 crores (435 million) viewers, second to the 2014 Indian Premier League's 55.2 crores (552 million), while the first season final between Jaipur Pink Panthers and U-Mumba was watched by 8.64 crores (86.4 million). Star Sports, the Pro Kabaddi League's broadcaster, subsequently announced in 2015 that it would acquire a 74% stake in the league's parent company Mashal Sports.\nFor the 2017 and 2018–19 season, the Pro Kabaddi League added four new teams, and changed its format to split the teams into two divisions known as \"zones\". Soon the league returned to its regular double round-robin format from the 2019 season.\nSince its inception there have been seven different champions. Patna Pirates has won the competition a record three times, in three consecutive seasons. They are also the only team to win back to back titles. Jaipur Pink Panthers has won twice, while U Mumba, Bengaluru Bulls, Bengal Warriors, Dabang Delhi K.C and Puneri Paltan have one title each.\nPuneri Paltan are the current champions, having won the 2023-24 season for the first time, by defeating Haryana Steelers in the final.\nThe Pro Kabaddi League (PKL) is a professional kabaddi league in India where franchise-based teams compete against each other. The league follows a round-robin format, where each team plays against every other team twice during the league phase. \nAt the end of the league phase, the top teams qualify for the playoffs. The playoffs consist of eliminators and finals where teams compete to reach the ultimate final match. The team that wins the final match is crowned the champion of the Pro Kabaddi League. \nThe league also has various individual awards like the Most Valuable Player (MVP), Best Raider, and Best Defender, among others, to recognize outstanding performances of players during the season.","content":"#Seasons\n##Season 1 (2014)\n##Season 2 (2015)\n##Season 3 (January 2016)\n##Season 4 (June 2016)\n##Season 5 (2017)\n##Season 6 (2018)\n##Season 7 (2019)\n##Season 8 (2021)\n##Season 9 (2022)\n##Season 10 (2023)\n##Season 11 (2024)\n#Viewership\n#Teams\n##Stadiums and locations\n#PKL season results\n##Results\n##By Season\n##Performance of all the teams in all seasons\n##Team records\n#Sponsorship\n#Team records\n##Total points scored\n##Total points conceded\n##Average points scored\n##Successful raids\n##Raid points\n##Average raid points (teams)\n##Successful tackles\n##Tackle points\n##Average tackle points (team)\n##Super raids\n##Super Tackles\n##Most Do or Die raid points (teams)\n##Most all outs inflicted\n##Most all outs conceded\n#Player records\n##Total points (all seasons)\n##Best raiders\n###Most raid points (all seasons)\n###Most successful raids (all seasons)\n###Average raid points\n###Most super raids\n###Most Do or Die raid points\n###Most Super 10s (all seasons)\n##Fastest to multiples of 500 raid points\n##Best defenders\n###Most tackle points (all seasons)\n###Most successful tackles (all seasons)\n###Average tackle points\n###Most Super Tackles (all seasons)\n###Most high 5s\n###Most Matches Played\n#Prize money\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

These methods encompassed modern oral surgery, cosmetic surgery, sutures, ligatures, amputations, tonsillectomies, mastectomies, cataract surgeries, lithotomies, hernia repair, gynecology, neurosurgery, and others. Surgery was a rare practice, as it was dangerous and often had fatal results. To perform these procedures, they used tools such as specula, catheters, enemas, bone levers, osteotomes, phlebotomes, probes, curettes, bone drills, bone forceps, cupping vessels, knives, scalpels, scissors, and spathas.","content":"#History\n#Tools\n##Cupping vessels\n##Chisels and raspatories\n##Drills and levers\n##Saws and trephines\n##Forceps\n##Probes and curettes\n##Scalpels\n##Specula\n##Spoon of Diocles\n##Catheters\n##Strigils\n##Knives and needles\n##Hooks\n##Other tools\n#Techniques\n##Abortion\n##Amputations and dissections\n##Bloodletting\n##Caesarean section\n##Cataract surgery\n##Cosmetic surgery\n##Hernia treatment\n##Lithotomy\n##Neurosurgery\n##Sutures, ligatures, and contractions\n##Tonsillectomies and mastectomies\n##Tooth extraction\n##Other techniques\n#References\n##Bibliography\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Luttra_Woman","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Luttra_Woman","summary":"The Luttra Woman is a skeletonised bog body from the Early Neolithic period (radiocarbon-dated 3928–3651 BC) that was discovered near Luttra, Sweden, on 20 May 1943. The skull was well-preserved, but some bones of the skeleton, particularly many  between the skull and the pelvis, were absent. Osteological assessment identified the remains as those of a young female. Her estimated height of 145 cm (4 ft 9 in) was deemed notably short for a Stone Age woman of the region. The presence of raspberry seeds in her stomach contents, coupled with an estimated age of early to mid-twenties at death, led to her being nicknamed Hallonflickan (Swedish: [ˈhalɔnflɪkːˌan] ; lit. 'Raspberry Girl'). As of 2015, she represented the earliest known Neolithic individual from Western Sweden.\nMultiple anthropological studies revealed no evidence of injuries or fatal diseases on her remains. She appeared to have been bound and placed in shallow water at or shortly after her death. Axel Bagge, an archaeologist who collaborated on the initial examination of her remains, hypothesised that she had been deliberately drowned, either as a human sacrifice or as the victim of a witch execution. Since 1994, her skeleton has been part of the permanent exhibition Forntid på Falbygden ('Prehistory in Falbygden') at the Falbygden Museum in Falköping, Sweden. In June 2011, a forensic reconstruction of her bust was incorporated to augment the display.","content":"#Discovery\n#Studies\n##Cause of death\n#Exhibition and reconstruction\n#See also\n#References\n##Notes\n##Citations\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

Based on the eponymous fashion dolls by Mattel, it is the first live-action Barbie film after numerous animated films and specials. Starring Margot Robbie as the title character and Ryan Gosling as Ken, the film follows them on a journey of self-discovery through Barbieland and the real world following an existential crisis. It is also a commentary regarding patriarchy and the effects of feminism. The supporting cast includes America Ferrera, Michael Cera, Kate McKinnon, Issa Rae, Rhea Perlman, and Will Ferrell.\nA live-action Barbie film was announced in September 2009 by Universal Pictures with Laurence Mark producing. Development began in April 2014, when Sony Pictures acquired the film rights. Following multiple writer and director changes and the casting of Amy Schumer and later Anne Hathaway as Barbie, the rights were transferred to Warner Bros. Pictures in October 2018. Robbie was cast in 2019, after Gal Gadot turned down the role due to scheduling conflicts, and Gerwig was announced as director and co-writer with Baumbach in 2020. The rest of the cast was announced in early 2022. Principal photography occurred primarily at Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden, England, and at the Venice Beach Skatepark in Los Angeles from March to July 2022.\nBarbie premiered at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles on July 9, 2023, and was released in the United States on July 21. Its concurrent release with Universal Pictures' Oppenheimer was the catalyst of the \"Barbenheimer\" phenomenon, encouraging audiences to see both films as a double feature.\n\nThe film grossed $1.446 billion and achieved several milestones, including the highest-grossing film of 2023, the highest-grossing film ever released by Warner Bros., and the 14th-highest-grossing film of all time. Named one of the top 10 films of 2023 by the National Board of Review and the American Film Institute, it received critical acclaim and other accolades, including eight Academy Award nominations (among them Best Picture), winning Best Original Song for \"What Was I Made For?\"; the song also won Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song while Barbie was awarded Golden Globe Award for Cinematic and Box Office Achievement.","content":"#Plot\n#Cast\n#Production\n##Development\n##Writing\n##Casting\n##Set design\n##Costumes, hair, and makeup\n##Filming\n##Post-production\n#Music\n#Marketing\n#Release\n##Theatrical\n##\"Barbenheimer\"\n##Home media\n##Censorship\n###Nine-dash line controversy\n####Vietnam\n####The Philippines\n####World map drawing and Warner Bros.' statement\n###Religious interpretation and LGBTQ+ themes\n####Pakistan\n####Middle East\n####Algeria\n#Reception\n##Box office\n###United States and Canada\n###Other territories\n##Critical response\n##Accolades\n#Themes and analysis\n##Philosophy\n##Feminism\n##Masculinity\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"2022_Sri_Lankan_protests","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2022_Sri_Lankan_protests","summary":"The 2022 Sri Lankan protests, commonly known as Aragalaya (Sinhala: අරගලය, lit. 'The Struggle'), were a series of mass protests that began in March 2022 against the government of Sri Lanka. The government was heavily criticized for mismanaging the Sri Lankan economy, which led to a subsequent economic crisis involving severe inflation, daily blackouts, and a shortage of fuel, domestic gas, and other essential goods. The protesters' main demand was the resignation of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and key officials from the Rajapaksa family. Despite the involvement of several opposition parties, most protesters considered themselves to be apolitical, with many expressing discontent with the parliamentary opposition. Protesters chanted slogans such as \"Go Home Gota\", \"Go Home Rajapaksas\", and \"Aragalayata Jaya Wewa\" (\"Victory to the struggle\"). Most protests were organized by the general public, with youths playing a major part by carrying out protests at Galle Face Green.\nThe government reacted to the protests with authoritarian methods, such as declaring a state of emergency, allowing the military to arrest civilians, imposing curfews, and restricting access to social media. The government violated the law and the Sri Lankan constitution by attempting to suppress the protests. The Sri Lankan diaspora also began demonstrations against the suppression of basic human rights in the country. In April, the government's ban on social media was perceived to have backfired; hashtags such as #GoHomeGota, which is believed to have been coined by an activist called Pathum Kerner in December 2021, had begun trending on Twitter internationally. The government's ban was lifted later that day. The Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka condemned the government's actions and summoned officials responsible for the blocking and abuse of protesters.\nOn 3 April, all 26 members of the Second Gotabaya Rajapaksa cabinet resigned with the exception of Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa. Critics said that the resignation was not valid as they did not follow constitutional protocol and several of the ministers who \"resigned\" were reinstated in different ministries the next day. Chief government whip Johnston Fernando insisted that President Gotabaya Rajapaksa would not resign under any circumstances. The protests, however, led to the removal of officials and ministers, including members of the Rajapaksa family and their close associates, and to the appointment of more qualified and veteran officials and the creation of the Advisory Group on Multilateral Engagement and Debt Sustainability.\nIn July 2022, protesters occupied the President's House in Colombo, causing Rajapaksa to flee and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to announce his own willingness to resign. About a week later, on 20 July, Parliament elected Wickremesinghe as President. By November 2022, the protests had largely cooled off due to improvement in economic conditions. While the protests were mostly over, it was noted that it would take until 2026 for full economic recovery to be achieved.","content":"#Background\n#Timeline\n##March\n##April\n###Declaration of state of emergency\n###Social media blocks\n###Cabinet resignation\n###Reconvening of Parliament\n###\"Occupy Galle Face\"\n###Mynagogama\n###19 April: Rambukkana incident\n###28 April: Island-wide token strike\n##May\n###HoruGoGama protests\n###Black Monday attacks on protesters\n###Resignation of Mahinda Rajapaksa\n###Deployment of military\n###Founding of No-Deal-Gama\n##June\n##July\n###9 July: Storming of President's House\n###13 July: Appointment of Acting President\n###14–15 July: President Rajapaksa's resignation\n###20–22 July: Under the new President, Galle Face raid\n##August\n##September\n##November\n#International protests\n#Reactions\n##New government\n##Opposition\n##International\n#Departures to foreign states\n#See also\n#Footnotes\n","lang":"en"}
{"title":"2022_FIFA_World_Cup","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2022_FIFA_World_Cup","summary":"The 2022 FIFA World Cup was the 22nd FIFA World Cup, the quadrennial world championship for national football teams organized by FIFA. It took place in Qatar from 20 November to 18 December 2022, after the country was awarded the hosting rights in 2010. It was the first World Cup to be held in the Middle East and Persian Gulf countries, and the second held entirely in Asia after the 2002 tournament in South Korea and Japan.\nThis tournament was the last with 32 participating teams, with the number of teams being increased to 48 for the 2026 edition. To avoid the extremes of Qatar's hot climate, the event was held in November and December instead of during the traditional months of May, June, or July. It was held over a reduced time frame of 29 days with 64 matches played in eight venues across five cities. Qatar entered the event—their first World Cup—automatically as the host's national team, alongside 31 teams determined by the qualification process.\nArgentina were crowned the champions after winning the final against the title holder France 4–2 on penalties following a 3–3 draw after extra time. It was Argentina's third title and their first since 1986, as well as being the first nation from outside of Europe to win the tournament since 2002. French player Kylian Mbappé became the first player to score a hat-trick in a World Cup final since Geoff Hurst in the 1966 final and won the Golden Boot as he scored the most goals (eight) during the tournament. Mbappé also became the first player to score in two consecutive finals since Vavá of Brazil did the same in 1958 and 1962.\nArgentine captain Lionel Messi was voted the tournament's best player, winning his second Golden Ball. The tournament has been considered exceptionally poetic as the capstone of his career, with the win fulfilling for some commentators a previously unmet criterion to be regarded as the greatest player of all time. Teammates Emiliano Martínez and Enzo Fernández won the Golden Glove, awarded to the tournament's best goalkeeper; and the Young Player Award, awarded to the tournament's best young player, respectively. With 172 goals, the tournament set a record for the highest number of goals scored in the 32-team format, with every participating team scoring at least one goal.\nThe choice to host the World Cup in Qatar attracted significant criticism, with concerns raised over the country's treatment of migrant workers, women, and members of the LGBT community, as well as Qatar's climate, lack of a strong football culture, scheduling changes, and allegations of bribery for hosting rights and wider FIFA corruption.","content":"#Format\n##Schedule\n##Prize money\n##Rule changes\n#Host selection\n##Cost of hosting the tournament\n#Venues\n##Stadiums\n##Security\n#Teams\n##Qualification\n##Squads\n##Draw\n###Draw result\n#Officiating\n#Opening ceremony\n#Group stage\n##Group A\n##Group B\n##Group C\n##Group D\n##Group E\n##Group F\n##Group G\n##Group H\n#Knockout stage\n##Bracket\n##Round of 16\n##Quarter-finals\n##Semi-finals\n##Third place play-off\n##Final\n#Statistics\n##Goalscorers\n##Discipline\n#Awards\n#Marketing\n##Branding\n##Merchandise\n##Broadcasting rights\n##Sponsorship\n#Symbols\n##Mascot\n##Match ball\n##Music\n#Controversies\n##Host selection criticism\n##Migrant workers\n##Move to November and December\n##Bidding corruption allegations, 2014\n##Russian participation\n##LGBT and women's rights\n##Influence of Iran\n##Treatment of Jewish and Israeli visitors\n##Accommodation\n#Security\n##Turkey\n##Pakistan\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}
{"title":"Shireen_Abu_Akleh","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Shireen_Abu_Akleh","summary":"Shireen Abu Akleh (Arabic: شيرين أبو عاقلة, romanized: Šīrīn Abū ʿĀqila; April 3, 1971 – May 11, 2022) was a prominent Palestinian-American journalist who worked as a reporter for 25 years for Al Jazeera, before she was killed by Israeli forces while wearing a blue press vest and covering a raid on the Jenin refugee camp in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Abu Akleh was one of the most prominent names across the Middle East for her decades of reporting in the Palestinian territories, and seen as a role model for many Arab and Palestinian women. She is considered to be an icon of Palestinian journalism.\nUpon her death on May 11, 2022, Israel denied responsibility and blamed Palestinian militants. However, it gradually changed its narrative until admitting she was likely \"accidentally\" killed by Israeli fire, but refused to undertake a criminal investigation. The admission came after several independent investigations were conducted by international media outlets, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, and the United States Department of State. Forensic Architecture refuted Israel's findings on September 20 and said Abu Akleh was deliberately targeted and denied medical aid after she was shot. In November 2022, the United States Department of Justice opened a separate investigation into the killing, in a move that Israel condemned and refused to cooperate with. Her niece Lina Abu Akleh has since been demanding that the Israeli forces responsible for her death be held accountable.\nThe manner of her death and the subsequent violent disruption of her funeral drew widespread international condemnation of Israel. During her funeral procession, the Israel Police attacked the pallbearers at the Saint Joseph's Hospital in East Jerusalem with batons and stun grenades. The hospital itself was also stormed by Israeli police officers, who assaulted patients and threw stun grenades, wounding and causing burns to medical staff in the building. The facility issued a statement from the Christian Churches of the Holy Land, stating that the Israel Police's actions constituted \"invasion and disproportionate use of force\" and a violation of the \"right of freedom of religion\" for the Palestinians. Abu Akleh's funeral was attended by tens of thousands of people carrying Palestinian flags and chanting nationalist songs; it is believed to have been the largest Palestinian funeral in Jerusalem in over twenty years. On October 26, 2023, the Israeli military bulldozed a memorial that had been erected at the site where Abu Akleh was killed.","content":"#Early life and education\n#Career\n#Death\n##Aftermath\n#Funeral\n#Reaction\n#Investigations\n##Initial Israel investigations\n##Subsequent investigations\n##Announcement of US investigation\n##Referral of case to the International Criminal Court\n#Remembrance and legacy\n#Honors and awards\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"2023_Pacific_hurricane_season","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2023_Pacific_hurricane_season","summary":"The 2023 Pacific hurricane season was an active and destructive Pacific hurricane season. In the Eastern Pacific basin (east of 140°W), 17 named storms formed; 10 of those became hurricanes, of which 8 strengthened into major hurricanes – double the seasonal average. In the Central Pacific basin (between 140°W and the International Date Line), no tropical cyclones formed for the fourth consecutive season, though four entered into the basin from the east. Collectively, the season had an above-normal accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) value of approximately 168 units. This season saw the return of El Niño and its associated warmer sea surface temperatures in the basin, which fueled the rapid intensification of several powerful storms. It officially began on May 15, 2023 in the Eastern Pacific, and on June 1 in the Central; both ended on November 30. These dates, adopted by convention, historically describe the period in each year when most tropical cyclogenesis occurs in these regions of the Pacific.\nForecasts at the outset of the 2023 season predicted busier-than-normal tropical cyclone activity in the eastern Pacific basin, largely due to El Niño. However, no tropical cyclones developed until June 27, when Hurricane Adrian initially formed, becoming the latest first-named Eastern Pacific tropical storm since Tropical Storm Agatha in 2016. In July, Hurricane Calvin became the season's first major hurricane, later passing just south of the Big Island of Hawaii as a tropical storm, bringing widespread rainfall to the area and neighboring Maui. In August, Category 4 Hurricane Dora passed south of the Hawaiian Islands and contributed to strong gradient winds over Hawaii, which in turn helped fan the flames of multiple devastating wildfires.  Later that month, Hurricane Hilary made landfall as a tropical storm in Baja California, later bringing torrential rainfall and gusty winds to the Southwestern United States. In early September, Hurricane Jova, the first Category 5 hurricane in the basin since 2018, caused rainfall, high waves and rip currents in areas previously affected by Hilary.\nOctober saw four tropical cyclones strike the Pacific Coast of Mexico. Tropical Storm Max struck Guerrero on October 9, resulting in intense flooding. Less than two days later, Hurricane Lidia rapidly intensified into a Category 4 hurricane and made landfall at peak intensity on Jalisco. Lidia was followed by Hurricane Norma, which made two landfalls in northwestern Mexico less than two weeks later. Hurricane Otis developed in the time period between Norma's landfalls, rapidly intensified into the second Category 5 hurricane of the season, and devastated Acapulco when it became the first Pacific hurricane to make landfall at Category 5 intensity, therefore surpassing Hurricane Patricia as the strongest landfalling Pacific hurricane on record.","content":"#Seasonal forecasts\n#Seasonal summary\n##Background\n##Early activity\n##Peak to late activity\n#Systems\n##Hurricane Adrian\n##Hurricane Beatriz\n##Hurricane Calvin\n##Tropical Depression Four-E\n##Hurricane Dora\n##Tropical Storm Eugene\n##Hurricane Fernanda\n##Tropical Storm Greg\n##Hurricane Hilary\n##Tropical Storm Irwin\n##Hurricane Jova\n##Tropical Depression Twelve-E\n##Tropical Storm Kenneth\n##Tropical Depression Fourteen-E\n##Hurricane Lidia\n##Tropical Storm Max\n##Hurricane Norma\n##Hurricane Otis\n##Tropical Storm Pilar\n##Tropical Storm Ramon\n#Storm names\n##Retirement\n#Season effects\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

During the season, tropical cyclones will be officially monitored by the Fiji Meteorological Service, Australian Bureau of Meteorology and New Zealand's MetService. The United States Armed Forces through the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) will also monitor the basin and issue unofficial warnings for American interests. The FMS attaches a number and an F suffix to tropical disturbances that form in or move into the basin while the JTWC designates significant tropical cyclones with a number and a P suffix. The BoM, FMS and MetService all use the Australian Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale and estimate windspeeds over a period of ten minutes, while the JTWC estimated sustained winds over a 1-minute period, which are subsequently compared to the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale (SSHWS).","content":"#Seasonal forecasts\n#Seasonal summary\n#Systems\n##Tropical Cyclone Ruby\n##Tropical Disturbance 02F\n##Severe Tropical Cyclone Cody\n##Tropical Depression 04F\n##Tropical Disturbance 05F\n##Tropical Disturbance 06F\n##Tropical Disturbance 07F\n##Severe Tropical Cyclone Dovi\n##Tropical Cyclone Eva\n##Tropical Cyclone Fili\n##Tropical Cyclone Gina\n##Other system\n#Storm names\n##Retirement\n#Season effects\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

Registered users could edit the canvas by changing the color of a single pixel with a replacement from a 16-color palette. After each pixel was placed, a timer prevented the user from placing any more pixels for a period of time varying from 5 to 20 minutes (depending on whether the user had verified their email address). The idea of the experiment was conceived by Josh Wardle. It was ended by Reddit administrators about 72 hours after its creation, on 3 April 2017.\nOver a million users edited the canvas, placing a total of approximately 16 million pixels, and, at the time the experiment was ended, over 90,000 users were actively viewing or editing the canvas.

{"title":"Display_resolution_standards","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Display_resolution_standards","summary":"A display resolution standard is a commonly used width and height dimension (display resolution) of an electronic visual display device, measured in pixels. This information is used for electronic devices such as a computer monitor. Certain combinations of width and height are standardized (e.g. by VESA) and typically given a name and an initialism which is descriptive of its dimensions.\nThe graphics display resolution is also known as the display mode or the video mode, although these terms usually include further specifications such as the image refresh rate and the color depth. \nThe resolution itself only indicates the number of distinct pixels that can be displayed on a screen, which affects the sharpness and clarity of the image. It can be controlled by various factors, such as the type of display device, the signal format, the aspect ratio, and the refresh rate.\nSome graphics display resolutions are frequently referenced with a single number (e.g. in \"1080p\" or \"4K\"), which represents the number of horizontal or vertical pixels. More generally, any resolution can be expressed as two numbers separated by a multiplication sign (e.g. \"1920×1080\"), which represent the width and height in pixels. Since most screens have a landscape format to accommodate the human field of view, the first number for the width (in columns) is larger than the second for the height (in lines), and this conventionally holds true for handheld devices that are predominatly or even exclusively used in portrait orientation.\nThe graphics display resolution is influenced by the aspect ratio, which is the ratio of the width to the height of the display. The aspect ratio determines how the image is scaled and stretched or cropped to fit the screen. The most common aspect ratios for graphics displays are 4:3, 16:10 (equal to 8:5), 16:9, and \"21:9\". The aspect ratio also affects the perceived size of objects on the screen.\nThe native screen resolution together with the physical dimensions of the graphics display can be used to calculate its pixel density. An increase in the pixel density often correlates with a decrease in the size of individual pixels on a display.\nSome graphics displays support multiple resolutions and aspect ratios, which can be changed by the user or by the software. In particular, some devices use a hardware\/native resolution that is a simple multiple of the recommended software\/virtual resolutions in order to show finer details; marketing terms for this include \"Retina display\".","content":"#Overview\n#Aspect ratio\n#High-definition\n##640 × 360 (nHD)\n##960 × 540 (qHD)\n##1280 × 720 (HD)\n##1600 × 900 (HD+)\n##1920 × 1080 (FHD)\n##2048 × 1080 (DCI 2K)\n##2560 × 1080 (UWFHD)\n##2560 × 1440 (QHD)\n###5120 × 1440 DQHD\n##3200 × 1800 (QHD+)\n##3440 × 1440 (UWQHD)\n##3840 × 1080\n##3840 × 1600\n##3840 × 2160 (4K UHD)\n##4096 × 2160 (DCI 4K)\n##5120 × 2160\n##5120 × 2880 (5K)\n##7680 × 4320 (8K UHD)\n#Video Graphics Array (VGA and derivatives)\n##160 × 120 (QQVGA)\n##240 × 160\n##320 × 240 (QVGA)\n##400 × 240 (WQVGA)\n##480 × 320 (HVGA)\n##640 × 480 (VGA)\n##800 × 480 (WVGA)\n##854 × 480 (FWVGA)\n##800 × 600 (SVGA)\n##1024 × 576, 1024 × 600 (WSVGA)\n##960 × 640\n##1280 × 960 (QuadVGA)\n#Extended Graphics Array (XGA and derivatives)\n##1024 × 768 (XGA)\n##WXGA\n###1366 × 768 (WXGA)\n###1280 × 800 (WXGA)\n###Other WXGA\n##1152 × 864 (XGA+)\n##1440 × 900 (WXGA+, WSXGA)\n###1600 × 1024\n###1280 × 854\n##1280 × 1024 (SXGA)\n##1400 × 1050 (SXGA+)\n##1680 × 1050 (WSXGA+)\n##1600 × 1200 (UXGA)\n##1920 × 1200 (WUXGA)\n##2048 × 1152 (QWXGA)\n##2048 × 1536 (QXGA)\n##2560 × 1600 (WQXGA)\n##2560 × 2048 (QSXGA)\n##2880 × 1800 (WQXGA+)\n##3200 × 2048 (WQSXGA)\n##3200 × 2400 (QUXGA)\n##3840 × 2400 (WQUXGA)\n#Unsystematic resolutions\n#See also\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"The_Batman_(film)","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Batman_(film)","summary":"The Batman is a 2022 American superhero film based on the DC Comics character Batman. Directed by Matt Reeves from a screenplay he wrote with Peter Craig, it is a reboot of the Batman film franchise produced by DC Films. Robert Pattinson stars as Bruce Wayne \/ Batman alongside Zoë Kravitz, Paul Dano, Jeffrey Wright, John Turturro, Peter Sarsgaard, Andy Serkis, and Colin Farrell. The film sees Batman, in his second year fighting crime in Gotham City, uncover corruption with ties to his own family while pursuing the Riddler (Dano), a mysterious serial killer targeting the city's elite.\nDevelopment began after Ben Affleck was cast as Batman in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) in 2013. Affleck signed on to direct, produce, co-write, and star in The Batman, but had reservations about the project and dropped out. Reeves took over in February 2017 and reworked the story, removing the DCEU connections to focus on a younger version of the character earlier in his vigilante career compared to Affleck's. He sought to explore Batman's detective side more than previous films, drawing inspiration from the films of Alfred Hitchcock and the New Hollywood era, and comics such as Year One (1987), The Long Halloween (1996–97), and Ego (2000). Pattinson was cast in May 2019, with further casting later that year. Filming began in the United Kingdom in January 2020, but was halted in March by the COVID-19 pandemic. Production resumed later in the year and concluded in Chicago in March 2021.\nThe Batman was theatrically released by Warner Bros. Pictures on March 4, 2022, three days after premiering at the Lincoln Center in Manhattan, and was delayed twice from its original June 2021 release date due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The film was a commercial success, grossing $771 million against a $185–200 million budget, making it the seventh-highest-grossing film of 2022. It received positive reviews from critics, was nominated for three awards at the 95th Academy Awards, and received numerous other accolades.

It is part of the Star Wars franchise. Set ten years after the Jedi Order was purged during the events of the film Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith (2005), the series follows surviving Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi who emerges from hiding to rescue the kidnapped Princess Leia from the Galactic Empire's Inquisitors. This brings Kenobi into conflict with his former apprentice, Darth Vader.\nEwan McGregor stars as the title character, reprising his role from the Star Wars prequel trilogy. Co-stars such as Joel Edgerton, Bonnie Piesse, Jimmy Smits, Hayden Christensen (Vader), and Ian McDiarmid also reprise their prequel trilogy roles. The project originated as a spin-off film written by Hossein Amini and directed by Stephen Daldry, but it was reworked as a limited series following the commercial failure of the film Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018). McGregor was confirmed to be starring in the series in August 2019, and Deborah Chow was hired to direct all of the episodes a month later. Production was scheduled to begin in July 2020, but the series was put on hold in January 2020 because Lucasfilm was unsatisfied with the scripts. Joby Harold was hired to rewrite the series and serve as showrunner in April 2020, executive producing with Chow, McGregor, Kathleen Kennedy, and Michelle Rejwan. Additional casting took place in March 2021. Filming began by that May in Los Angeles, using StageCraft video wall technology, and wrapped by that September. Natalie Holt composed the original score, while Star Wars film composer John Williams wrote a new main theme for Kenobi that William Ross adapted for several scenes.\nObi-Wan Kenobi premiered on May 27, 2022, with its first two episodes. The other four episodes were released weekly through June 22. The series received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise directed towards McGregor's performance, the action sequences, John Williams's new main theme, the character-driven narrative, and the series' emotional weight, although the writing received some criticism. It also received multiple accolades, including winning Best Limited Event Series for Streaming and Best Guest Starring Role on Television (for Christensen) at the 47th Saturn Awards, as well as a nomination for Outstanding Limited or Anthology Series at the 75th Primetime Emmy Awards.","content":"#Premise\n#Episodes\n#Cast and characters\n##Starring\n##Recurring co-stars\n##Other co-stars\n#Production\n##Background\n##Development\n##Writing\n##Casting\n##Design\n##Filming\n##Music\n#Marketing\n#Release\n##Streaming\n##Home media\n#Reception\n##Audience viewership\n##Critical response\n##Accolades\n##Moses Ingram casting controversy\n#Documentary special\n#Comic miniseries\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

Built in May 1950 at N&W's Roanoke (East End) Shops in Roanoke, Virginia, it was one of the last mainline passenger steam locomotives built in the United States and represents a pinnacle of American steam locomotive technology.\nNo. 611 hauled N&W's premier passenger trains between Norfolk, Virginia, and Cincinnati, Ohio; and ferried Southern Railway's (SOU) passenger trains through the Blue Ridge Mountains between Monroe and Bristol, Virginia. Retired from revenue service in 1959, No. 611 was donated to the Virginia Museum of Transportation (VMT), where it became the sole survivor of the 14 class J locomotives.\nIn 1982, No. 611 was restored to operation by N&W successor Norfolk Southern (NS). It became the mainline star of the railroad's steam program, pulling excursion trains as far south as Florida, as far north as New York, and as far west as Illinois and Missouri. In late 1994, when liability insurance costs led NS to end its steam program, the locomotive was again retired and moved back to the VMT.\nIn 2015, after a year of restoration at the North Carolina Transportation Museum (NCTM) in Spencer, North Carolina, No. 611 returned to mainline excursion service as part of the NS 21st Century Steam program. That program ended in 2017, and the VMT has since operated No. 611 in excursion service and as a traveling exhibit, spending time at the NCTM and Strasburg Rail Road (SRC) in Strasburg, Pennsylvania. \nFrequently invoked as an icon of Roanoke and its railroading history, No. 611 was declared a National Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) in 1984 and was designated the official state steam locomotive of Virginia by the Virginia General Assembly in 2017. It was added to the Virginia Landmarks Register by the Virginia Department of Historic Resources (DHR) in 2023.

Throughout his career, he has generally preferred a live, natural approach to recording in the studio, and developed a method of recording drums sometimes referred to as the \"Glyn Johns method\". \nThe years 1964–1984 marked Johns's peak era of activity in which he engineered or produced numerous hit records. In 1965 Johns became one of the first independent British recording engineers to operate freelance rather than under the hire of a particular record label or studio. He was involved in making some of the most influential albums of the rock era such as Beggars Banquet and Let It Bleed by the Rolling Stones, Who's Next by the Who, and Led Zeppelin's debut album.  Johns was the chief engineer during the Beatles' Get Back sessions for what became the Let It Be album, as documented in the films Let It Be (1970) and The Beatles: Get Back (2021). Since 1984 Johns has continued to be active in the industry.    \nJohns is the father of Ethan Johns, and the older brother of Andy Johns (1950–2013), all three of whom shared the same career.

{"title":"Typhoon_Doksuri","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Typhoon_Doksuri","summary":"Typhoon Doksuri, known in the Philippines as Super Typhoon Egay, was a powerful and highly destructive tropical cyclone which became the costliest typhoon to hit China, and the costliest typhoon on record, breaking the previous record of Typhoon Mireille in 1991. Doksuri was also the strongest typhoon to impact Fujian since Typhoon Meranti in 2016, and the most powerful typhoon to strike the province since records began in 1950. Aside from China, Doksuri also caused extensive damage in the Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam, in late July 2023. The name Doksuri means eagle in Korean. \nThe fifth named storm and third typhoon of the inactive 2023 Pacific typhoon season, Doksuri started as a low-pressure area in the Philippines, far off the eastern coast of Mindanao. Tracking northwestward, it rapidly intensified into a typhoon over the Philippines prior to making landfall over the Babuyan Islands. Together with the southwest monsoon, Doksuri showered most of the northern and central Luzon island with heavy rains, triggering floods in various regions of the country. Doksuri steadily weakened after interacting with land, but by late July 27, Doksuri underwent another round of rapid intensification in the South China Sea. Doksuri moved towards Fujian, China, before rapidly weakening overland, and Doksuri dissipated early on the next day.\nDoksuri left behind a trail of severe destruction in its wake. The typhoon killed 137 and left 285 people injured, 27 of those deaths were on board the MB Aya Express who were killed when the pump boat capsized. Floods were reported in 9 out of the Philippines' 17 regions, affecting over 2 million people and requiring over 300,000 to evacuate. The typhoon's close proximity and large influence to Taiwan caused around 150,000 people to lose power. The storm affected over 724,600 people and 262.3 ha (648 acres) of farmland in China's southeastern province of Fujian; 44 houses were damaged, with 178 houses completely destroyed.\nIn Fujian, the rainfall set records for 24-hour totals, including an accumulation of more than 648 mm (25.5 in). Torrential rains impacted many areas, with accumulations in Xiamen, Quanzhou and Putian reaching 50 mm (2.0 in).  The remnants of the storm produced heavy rainfall in Beijing. The remnants dropped up to 744.8 mm (29.32 in) of rainfall in Wangjiayuan Reservoir in Changping District with Doksuri setting maximum rainfall records since recordkeeping began during the Qing dynasty in 1883. Overall, Doksuri caused US$28.4 billion worth of damages across the four countries affected by the typhoon.","content":"#Meteorological history\n#Preparations\n##Philippines\n##Taiwan\n##China\n#Impact\n##Philippines\n###Widespread flooding\n###MB Aya Express\n##Taiwan\n##China\n###Fujian\n###Beijing, Jilin and Hebei\n##Vietnam\n#Aftermath\n##China\n###National losses\n#Retirement\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}
{"title":"2022_Serbian_general_election","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2022_Serbian_general_election","summary":"General elections were held in Serbia on 3 April 2022 to elect both the president of Serbia and members of the National Assembly. Initially, parliamentary elections were scheduled to be held in 2024; however, in October 2020 president Aleksandar Vučić said that snap parliamentary elections would be held in or before April 2022. In addition to the general elections, local elections were held simultaneously in 12 municipalities and 2 cities, including Belgrade, the capital of Serbia.\nThe Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) came to power after the 2012 election when it formed a coalition government with the Socialist Party of Serbia. SNS won a supermajority of seats following the 2020 parliamentary election, which was boycotted by the major opposition Alliance for Serbia coalition that claimed that the election would not be free and fair. Vučić, who was elected president in 2017, faced protests during his first term, most notably during 2018–2020 and in July 2020. The government also oversaw the inter-party dialogues regarding electoral conditions which took place in 2021, while the agreement regarding the conditions between the government and opposition parties was reached in October 2021. Over the course of 2021 and early 2022, environmental protests were also held, reaching a climax in November and December 2021. A constitutional referendum, held in January 2022, was approved by 60 percent of the voters, although the turnout was 30 percent.\nThe campaign period was met with polarisation. Some organisations noted that the ruling party dominated the media, although news channels organised debates and political programme presentations during this period. Candidates concentrated on issues such as fighting against corruption, emphasising the rule of law, as well as issues regarding the economy, environment, and infrastructure. The Republic Electoral Commission confirmed that 19 parliamentary lists and eight presidential candidates registered to participate in the general elections.\nVučić won 60 percent of the votes in the first round of the presidential election, while Zdravko Ponoš, the candidate of the United for the Victory of Serbia coalition, placed second. The coalition around SNS lost its majority in the National Assembly, although 12 ballot lists crossed the threshold and entered the National Assembly. Multiple non-governmental organisations noted the occurrence of election irregularities during the election day. According to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, an uneven playing field favoured the incumbents, as they had unbalanced access to the media, pressured public sector employees to support the incumbents, enjoyed significant campaign finance disparities, and misused state resources to bolster their support.

The boat, named Adriana, which had a capacity of 400 people, carried an estimated 400 to 750 migrants, mostly from Pakistan, Syria, Palestine, and Egypt, and some from Afghanistan. After departing from Tobruk, Libya, on 10 June, concerns were raised by 13 June, with the vessel then located in the Maritime Search and Rescue (SAR) zone assigned to Greece. The Hellenic Coast Guard (HCG) helicopter and later the HCG vessel ΠΠΛΣ-920 arrived on scene, took aerial photos of the vessel, made offers of assistance that were allegedly refused, then remained there as an observer until the boat capsized and sank. After the Adriana had sunk \"close to the deepest part of the Mediterranean Sea\", the HCG and the military initiated a massive search and rescue operation. One hundred and four men were rescued, and 82 bodies were recovered. By 18 June, officials had acknowledged that over 500 people were \"presumed dead.\"\nBy July 2023, investigations by the BBC, the New York Times, The Guardian, German public broadcaster ARD\/NDR\/Funk and Greek investigative outlet Solomon, together with research agency Forensis research group—a sister organisation of Forensic Architecture, cast doubts on the original reports by the HCG. Based on survivors' interviews, court documents, and sources from the coastguards they found evidence suggesting that the HCG ship may have caused the overcrowded vessel to capsize while attempting to tow it, which HCG denies. The HCG said it was caused by a \"commotion\" on the vessel. When the Adriana capsized and sank shortly after 2:00 AM (EEST), the only vessel present was the HCG vessel ΠΠΛΣ-920 manned by a team that included four armed special operations coast guards wearing masks.\nThe European Ombudsman is investigating accusations that European Union (EU) border protection agency, Frontex, and the HCG did not take preventative steps to avoid the shipwreck.

{"title":"Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization","summary":"Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, 597 U.S. 215 (2022), is a landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in which the court held that the Constitution of the United States does not confer a right to abortion. The court's decision overruled both Roe v. Wade (1973) and Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992), returning to the federal and state legislatures the power to regulate any aspect of abortion not protected by federal statutory law.\nThe case concerned the constitutionality of a 2018 Mississippi state law that banned most abortion operations after the first 15 weeks of pregnancy. Jackson Women's Health Organization—Mississippi's only abortion clinic at the time—had sued Thomas E. Dobbs, state health officer with the Mississippi State Department of Health, in March 2018. Lower courts had enjoined enforcement of the law. The injunctions were based on the ruling in Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992), which had prevented states from banning abortion before fetal viability, generally within the first 24 weeks, on the basis that a woman's choice for abortion during that time is protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\nOral arguments before the Supreme Court were held in December 2021. In May 2022, Politico published a leaked draft majority opinion by Justice Samuel Alito; the leaked draft largely matched the final decision. On June 24, 2022, the Court issued a decision that, by a vote of 6–3, reversed the lower court rulings. A smaller majority of five justices joined the opinion overturning Roe and Casey. The majority held that abortion is neither a constitutional right mentioned in the Constitution nor a fundamental right implied by the concept of ordered liberty that comes from Palko v. Connecticut. Chief Justice John Roberts agreed with the judgment upholding the Mississippi law but did not join the majority in the opinion to overturn Roe and Casey.\nProminent American scientific and medical communities, labor unions, editorial boards, most Democrats, and many religious organizations (including most Jewish and mainline Protestant churches) opposed Dobbs, while the Catholic Church, many evangelical churches, and many Republican politicians supported it. Protests and counterprotests over the decision occurred. There have been conflicting analyses of the impact of the decision on abortion rates.\nDobbs was widely criticized and led to profound cultural changes in American society surrounding abortion. After the decision, several states immediately introduced abortion restrictions or revived laws that Roe and Casey had made dormant. As of 2024, abortion is greatly restricted in 17 states, overwhelmingly in the Southern United States. In national public opinion surveys, support for legalized abortion access rose 10 to 15 percentage points by the following year. Referenda conducted in the decision's wake in Kansas, Montana, California, Vermont, Michigan, Kentucky, and Ohio uniformly came out in favor of abortion rights, generally by margins that were both bipartisan and overwhelming.","content":"#Background\n##Common law\n##Constitutional right\n##Evolution of the composition of the Supreme Court\n#Gestational Age Act\n##Lower courts\n#Supreme Court\n##Oral argument\n##Leaked draft opinion\n###Reactions\n###Investigation\n##Opinions\n###Majority opinion\n###Concurrences\n###Concurrence in judgment\n###Dissent\n#Impact\n##Pre-decision\n##Post-decision\n###State laws restricting abortion\n####EMTALA and federal preemption\n###State laws expanding abortion access\n###Congressional proposals\n###Executive action by President Biden\n###Medical abortion, in vitro fertilization, and other processes\n###Data privacy\n###2022 and 2024 United States election seasons\n###Effects on abortion rates\n###Effects on infant mortality\n#Reaction\n##Legal journalists\n##Political\n###Support\n###Opposition\n##Religious\n##Civil rights\n##Health and education\n##International\n##News organizations\n##Public\n##Corporate and celebrity\n#Legacy\n##Cultural and political effects\n##Medical and sociological effects\n#See also\n#Footnotes\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Canada_convoy_protest","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Canada_convoy_protest","summary":"A series of protests and blockades in Canada against COVID-19 vaccine mandates and restrictions, called the Freedom Convoy (French: Convoi de la liberté) by organizers, began in early 2022. The initial convoy movement was created to protest vaccine mandates for crossing the United States border, but later evolved into a protest about COVID-19 mandates in general. Beginning January 22, hundreds of vehicles formed convoys from several points and traversed Canadian provinces before converging on Ottawa on January 29, 2022, with a rally at Parliament Hill. The convoys were joined by thousands of pedestrian protesters. Several offshoot protests blockaded provincial capitals and border crossings with the United States.\nIn late 2021, both Canada and the US accommodated unvaccinated cross-border truckers by exempting them from COVID-19 vaccine requirements to prevent exacerbating existing supply chain disruptions. The exemptions in Canada ended on January 15, 2022, and the US exemption ended on January 22, 2022. Of the 120,000 Canadian licensed truck drivers who regularly serve cross-border routes, approximately 85 per cent were vaccinated against COVID-19 by January, leaving up to 16,000 Canadian truckers potentially affected by the restriction.\nProtesters occupied the downtown core of Ottawa and stated that they would not leave until all COVID-19 restrictions and mandates, trucking related and beyond, were repealed. Officials expressed concern about the economic impact of border blockades. On February 11, Ontario Premier Doug Ford declared a state of emergency, introducing new legal sanctions on the impediment of trade routes, highways, airports, ports, bridges and railways. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and US President Joe Biden spoke on February 11 to discuss ending blockades at the border. On February 14, Trudeau invoked the Emergencies Act for the first time since its passing in 1988. Between February 17 and 20, a large joint-operation police presence in Ottawa arrested organizers and protesters, removed parked vehicles, and dismantled blockades from Ottawa streets. By February 21, most of the protesters had been cleared from Ottawa.\nThe convoy was condemned by trucking industry and labour groups. The Canadian Trucking Alliance stated that most protesters had no connection to trucking. Near a blockade in Coutts, Alberta, multiple weapons were seized, and four men charged with conspiracy to commit murder of Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) officers. Officials raised concerns of some protesters' involvement with far-right extremist groups, including those promoting violence, and that some protesters called for the federal government of Canada to be overthrown. Some sources have called the protests an occupation or a siege. On the political front, Trudeau and New Democratic Party (NDP) leader Jagmeet Singh condemned the convoy, while many members of Parliament from the Conservative Party of Canada endorsed the convoy; Republican politicians from the United States, as well as other conservative politicians and media figures, also endorsed the convoy.","content":"#Background\n##Protest goals\n##Initial events and the start of the protest\n###American influence\n###Fundraising\n###Donor list hacked\n##Vaccine mandates and passports\n###Vaccination requirements for US–Canada cross-border travel\n#Convoy to Ottawa\n#Ottawa protest\n##Peak size of Parliament Hill demonstration\n##Desecration and community harassment\n##Ottawa protests and entrenchment\n##After clearance\n#Major blockades\n##Alberta–Montana\n##Ontario–Michigan\n#Participants and response\n##Groups\n##Counter-protests\n##Ottawa Police Service response\n##Integrated Command Centre response\n###Clearance\n##Municipal response\n##Provincial response\n##Federal response\n###Emergencies Act\n#Related events\n##Other border crossing obstructions\n###British Columbia–Washington\n###Manitoba–North Dakota\n##Other Canadian protests\n###Toronto\n###Winnipeg\n###Fredericton\n###Nova Scotia\n###Edmonton\n###Other\n##International protests\n##Rolling Thunder Ottawa\n#Results and aftermath\n##Parliamentary committee investigations\n###FINA Committee\n###SECU Committee\n###PROC Committee\n###DEDC Committee\n###Public Order Emergency Commission\n##Economic loss and costs\n###In Ottawa\n###Alberta–Montana\n###Ontario–Michigan\n###Manitoba–North Dakota\n##Criticism of Ottawa Police\n##Criminal investigations\n##Lawsuits\n###Class-action lawsuit\n###Canadian Civil Liberties Association\n#Statements and reactions\n##Canadian politicians\n###Liberal Party\n###Conservative Party\n###Other Canadian politicians\n##American politicians and media figures\n##Trucking industry and labour groups\n##Mass media outlets\n##Miscellaneous\n##Opinion polls\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

He is best known for his novels Money (1984) and London Fields (1989). He received the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for his memoir Experience and was twice listed for the Booker Prize (shortlisted in 1991 for Time's Arrow and longlisted in 2003 for Yellow Dog). Amis was a professor of creative writing at the University of Manchester's Centre for New Writing from 2007 until 2011. In 2008, The Times named him one of the 50 greatest British writers since 1945. \nAmis's work centres on the excesses of \"late-capitalist\" Western society, whose perceived absurdity he often satirised through grotesque caricature. He was portrayed by some literary critics as a master of what The New York Times called \"the new unpleasantness\". He was inspired by Saul Bellow and Vladimir Nabokov, as well as by his father Kingsley Amis. Amis influenced many British novelists of the late 20th and early 21st centuries, including Will Self and Zadie Smith.\nA life-long smoker, Amis died from oesophageal cancer at his house in Florida in 2023. The New York Times wrote after his death: \"To come of reading age in the last three decades of the 20th century – from the oil embargo through the fall of the Berlin Wall, all the way to 9\/11 – was to live, it now seems clear, in the Amis Era.\"","content":"#Early life\n#Early writing\n#Main career\n##1980s and 1990s\n##2000s\n##2010s and 2020s\n##Other work\n###University of Manchester\n#Personal life\n##Death\n#Views\n##Writing\n##Nuclear proliferation\n##Geopolitics\n##Electoral politics\n##Islam and Islamism\n##Euthanasia\n##Agnosticism\n#Bibliography\n##Novels\n##Short fiction\n##Non-fiction\n##Screenplays\n#Notes\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

Despite the season occurring during an El Niño event, which typically favors activity in the basin, activity was abnormally low. This was primarily due to a consistent period of negative PDO, which typically discourages tropical storm formation in this basin. The season was less active than the 2023 Atlantic hurricane season in terms of named storms, the fourth such season on record, after 2005, 2010 and 2020. The season's number of storms also did not exceed that of the 2023 Pacific hurricane season. Only ten became typhoons, with four strengthening further into super typhoons. However, it was very destructive, primarily due to Typhoon Doksuri which devastated the northern Philippines, Taiwan, and China in July, becoming the costliest typhoon on record as well as the costliest typhoon to hit mainland China, and Typhoon Haikui in September, which devastated China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. The season was less active in Southeast Asia, with no tropical storm making landfall in mainland Vietnam (the third since the country's independence, after the 1976 and 2002 seasons).\nThe season ran throughout 2023, though most tropical cyclones typically develop between May and October. The season's first named storm, Sanvu, formed on April 21, while its last named storm, Jelawat, dissipated on December 20. In May, Typhoon Mawar intensified into the first typhoon of the season on May 21, later becoming one of the strongest Northern Hemisphere tropical cyclones on record in May.\nThe scope of this article is limited to the Pacific Ocean to the north of the equator between 100°E and 180th meridian.

The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) will name a tropical cyclone if it has 10-minute sustained wind speeds of at least 65 km\/h (40 mph) anywhere in the basin, while the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) assigns names to tropical cyclones which are active in the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR), located between 135°E and 115°E and between 5°N–25°N, regardless of whether or not a tropical cyclone has already been given a name by the JMA.

Directed by Peter Sohn and produced by Denise Ream, it was written by Sohn, John Hoberg, Kat Likkel, and Brenda Hsueh. The film stars the voices of Leah Lewis, Mamoudou Athie, Ronnie del Carmen, Shila Ommi, Wendi McLendon-Covey, and Catherine O'Hara. Set in a world inhabited by anthropomorphic elements of nature, the story follows fire element Ember Lumen and water element Wade Ripple, who spend time together in the city while trying to save a convenience store owned by Ember's father, Bernie.\nDevelopment of Elemental began when Sohn pitched the concept to Pixar based on the idea of whether fire and water could ever connect or not. The film draws inspiration from Sohn's youth, growing up as the son of immigrants in New York City during the 1970s, highlighting the city's distinct cultural and ethnic diversity while the story is inspired by romantic films like Guess Who's Coming to Dinner (1967), Moonstruck (1987), and Amélie (2001). The production team conducted research by spending many hours watching point-of-view city tours on YouTube like Venice and Amsterdam for inspiration. Animation tools were utilized to design the visual effects and appearance of each character, particularly its main characters. Production on Elemental lasted for seven years, both in the studio and at the filmmakers' homes, on an estimated $200 million budget. Thomas Newman composed the score, and Lauv wrote and performed the song \"Steal the Show\". The film is dedicated to Pixar animators Ralph Eggleston, Thomas Gonzales, Amber Martorelli, and J. Garrett Sheldrew, all of whom died in 2022.\nElemental debuted out of competition as the closing film at the 76th Cannes Film Festival on May 27, 2023, and was released in the United States on June 16 in RealD 3D, 4DX, and Dolby Cinema formats. Despite initially opening below projections, the film was ultimately considered by analysts to be a sleeper hit and grossed $496.4 million worldwide. It was nominated for several awards, including the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature and the Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film.","content":"#Plot\n#Voice cast\n#Production\n##Development\n##Writing\n##Casting\n##Inspiration\n##Animation and design\n#Music\n#Release\n##Marketing\n##Streaming and home media\n#Reception\n##Box office\n##Critical response\n##Accolades\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

Unlike other food products, infant formula often does not have an available and acceptable substitute as a source of nutrition for those who rely on it. In addition to infants, the formula recalls affected non-infant medical patients who require nasogastric feeding or have certain other conditions.\nOn May 14, nationwide out-of-stock rates were reported to be 43%, up from 31% two weeks prior; by May 22, they had surged to 70%, where they remained through the start of July. (The Wall Street Journal states that the normal out-of-stock rate is 10%, while other sources say that in the first half of 2021, out-of-stock rates were 2%-8%.)

{"title":"Acquisition_of_Twitter_by_Elon_Musk","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Acquisition_of_Twitter_by_Elon_Musk","summary":"The business magnate Elon Musk initiated an acquisition of American social media company Twitter, Inc. on April 14, 2022, and concluded it on October 27, 2022. Musk had begun buying shares of the company in January 2022, becoming its largest shareholder by April with a 9.1 percent ownership stake. Twitter invited Musk to join its board of directors, an offer he initially accepted before declining. On April 14, Musk made an unsolicited offer to purchase the company, to which Twitter's board responded with a \"poison pill\" strategy to resist a hostile takeover before unanimously accepting Musk's buyout offer of $44 billion on April 25. Musk stated that he planned to introduce new features to the platform, make its algorithms open-source, combat spambot accounts, and promote free speech, framing the acquisition as the cornerstone of X, an \"everything app\".\nIn July, Musk announced his intention to terminate the agreement, asserting that Twitter had breached their agreement by refusing to crack down on spambot accounts. The company filed a lawsuit against Musk in the Delaware Court of Chancery shortly thereafter, with a trial scheduled for the week of October 17. Weeks before the trial was set to begin, Musk reversed course, announcing that he would move forward with the acquisition. The deal was closed on October 28, with Musk immediately becoming Twitter's new owner and CEO. Twitter was taken private and merged into a new parent company named X Corp. Musk promptly fired several top executives, including previous CEO Parag Agrawal. Musk has since proposed several reforms to Twitter and laid off half of the company's workforce. Hundreds of employees then resigned from the company after Musk issued an ultimatum demanding they commit to \"extremely hardcore\" work. Linda Yaccarino was appointed CEO of X Corp. In July 2023, the Twitter service was rebranded as X.\nReactions to the buyout were mixed, with praise for Musk's planned reforms and vision for the company, particularly his calls for greater free speech, but criticism over fears of a potential rise in misinformation and disinformation, harassment, and hate speech on the platform. Within the United States, conservatives have largely supported the acquisition, while many liberals and former Twitter employees have voiced concerns about Musk's intentions.

{"title":"Boris_Johnson","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Boris_Johnson","summary":"Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson (born 19 June 1964) is a British politician and writer who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and Leader of the Conservative Party from 2019 to 2022. He was previously Foreign Secretary from 2016 to 2018 and Mayor of London from 2008 to 2016. He was Member of Parliament (MP) for Henley from 2001 to 2008 and Uxbridge and South Ruislip from 2015 to 2023.\nIn his youth Johnson attended Eton College and Balliol College, Oxford, and he was elected President of the Oxford Union in 1986. In 1989 he began writing for The Daily Telegraph, and from 1999 to 2005 he was the editor of The Spectator. He became a member of the Shadow Cabinet of Michael Howard in 2001 before being dismissed over a claim that he had lied about an extramarital affair. After Howard resigned Johnson became a member of David Cameron's Shadow Cabinet. He was elected Mayor of London in 2008 and resigned from the House of Commons to focus his attention on the mayoralty. He was re-elected mayor in 2012, but did not run for re-election in 2016. At the 2015 general election he was elected MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip. Johnson was a prominent figure in the Brexit campaign in the 2016 European Union membership referendum. After the referendum Prime Minister Theresa May appointed him foreign secretary. He resigned from the position in 2018 in protest at both the Chequers Agreement and May's approach to Brexit.\nJohnson succeeded May as prime minister. He re-opened Brexit negotiations with the European Union and in early September he prorogued Parliament; the Supreme Court later ruled the prorogation to have been unlawful. After agreeing to a revised Brexit withdrawal agreement but failing to win parliamentary support, Johnson called a snap general election to be held in December 2019, in which he won a landslide victory. During Johnson's premiership, the government responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by introducing various emergency powers to mitigate its impact and approved a nationwide vaccination programme. He also responded to the Russian invasion of Ukraine by imposing sanctions on Russia and authorising foreign aid and weapons shipments to Ukraine. In the Partygate scandal it was found that numerous parties had been held at 10 Downing Street during national COVID-19 lockdowns, and COVID-19 social distancing laws were breached by 83 individuals, including Johnson, who in April 2022 was issued with a fixed penalty notice. The publishing of the Sue Gray report in May 2022 and a widespread sense of dissatisfaction led in June 2022 to a vote of confidence in his leadership amongst Conservative MPs, which he won. In July 2022, revelations over his appointment of Chris Pincher as deputy chief whip of the party while knowing of allegations of sexual misconduct against him led to a mass resignation of members of his government and to Johnson announcing his resignation as prime minister. He was succeeded as prime minister by Liz Truss, his foreign secretary. He remained in the House of Commons as a backbencher until 9 June 2023, when he received the draft of the Commons Privileges Committee investigation into his conduct that unanimously found that he had lied to the Commons on numerous occasions. Johnson resigned his position as MP the same day.\nJohnson is a controversial figure in British politics. His supporters have praised him for being humorous, witty, and entertaining, with an appeal reaching beyond traditional Conservative Party voters, viewing him as an electoral asset to the party. Conversely, his critics have accused him of lying, elitism, cronyism, and bigotry. During his premiership his supporters praised him for \"getting Brexit done\", overseeing the UK's COVID-19 vaccination programme, which was amongst the fastest in the world, and being one of the first world leaders to offer humanitarian support to Ukraine following the Russian invasion of the country. His tenure also encompassed several controversies and scandals, and is viewed as the most scandalous premiership of modern times by historians and biographers alike.","content":"#Early life and education\n##Childhood\n##Eton and Oxford: 1977–1987\n#Early career\n##The Times and The Daily Telegraph: 1987–1994\n##Political columnist: 1994–1999\n##The Spectator and MP for Henley: 1999–2008\n###Becoming an MP\n###Second term\n#Mayor of London (2008–2016)\n##Mayoral election: 2007–2008\n##First term: 2008–2012\n###Policies\n###Relations with the police, finance, and the media\n###Re-election campaign\n##Second term: 2012–2016\n#Return to Parliament\n##Brexit campaign: 2015–2016\n##Foreign Secretary: 2016–2018\n##Return to the backbenches: 2018–2019\n###Journalism\n###2019 Conservative Party leadership election\n#Premiership (2019–2022)\n##First term (July–December 2019)\n###Brexit policy\n###First Cabinet\n###Loss of working majority\n###2019 general election\n##Second term (December 2019 – September 2022)\n###Second Cabinet\n###COVID-19 pandemic\n###Immigration\n###Legislative agenda\n###2021 Downing Street refurbishment controversy\n###Owen Paterson controversy\n###Partygate scandal\n###Starmer slur controversy\n###Vote of confidence\n###June 2022 by-elections\n###Pincher scandal\n###Mass resignations\n###Announcement of resignation\n##Environmental policies\n##Foreign policy\n###Hong Kong and China\n###Afghanistan\n###UK–EU trade negotiation\n###Russia and Ukraine\n#Post-premiership (2022–present)\n#Political positions and ideology\n##Environment\n##Immigration and the European Union\n##Unionism and devolution\n#Public image\n#Personal life\n##Religion\n##Relationships\n##Family and ancestors\n#Honours\n#Works\n#Notes\n#References\n##Footnotes\n##Sources\n#Further reading\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}
{"title":"Pelé","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pelé","summary":"Edson Arantes do Nascimento (Brazilian Portuguese: [ˈɛdsõ aˈɾɐ̃tʃiz du nasiˈmẽtu]; 23 October 1940 – 29 December 2022), better known by his nickname Pelé (Portuguese pronunciation: [peˈlɛ]), was a Brazilian professional footballer who played as a forward. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players in the history of the sport, he was among the most successful and popular sports figures of the 20th century. His 1,279 goals in 1,363 games, which includes friendlies, is recognised as a Guinness World Record. In 1999, he was named Athlete of the Century by the International Olympic Committee and was included in the Time list of the 100 most important people of the 20th century. In 2000, Pelé was voted World Player of the Century by the International Federation of Football History & Statistics (IFFHS) and was one of the two joint winners of the FIFA Player of the Century, alongside Diego Maradona. \nPelé began playing for Santos at age 15 and the Brazil national team at 16. During his international career, he won three FIFA World Cups: 1958, 1962 and 1970, the only player to do so and the youngest player to win a World Cup (17). He was nicknamed O Rei (The King) following the 1958 tournament. With 77 goals in 92 games for Brazil, Pelé held the record as the national team's top goalscorer for over fifty years. At club level, he is Santos's all-time top goalscorer with 643 goals in 659 games. In a golden era for Santos, he led the club to the 1962 and 1963 Copa Libertadores, and to the 1962 and 1963 Intercontinental Cup. Credited with connecting the phrase \"The Beautiful Game\" with football, Pelé's \"electrifying play and penchant for spectacular goals\" made him a global star, and his teams toured internationally to take full advantage of his popularity. During his playing days, Pelé was for a period the best-paid athlete in the world. After retiring in 1977, Pelé was a worldwide ambassador for football and made many acting and commercial ventures. In 2010, he was named the honorary president of the New York Cosmos.\nPelé averaged almost a goal per game throughout his career and could strike the ball with either foot, as well as being able to anticipate his opponents' movements. While predominantly a striker, he could also be a playmaker, providing assists with his vision and passing ability. He would often use his dribbling skills to go past opponents. In Brazil, he was hailed as a national hero for his accomplishments in football and for his outspoken support of policies that improve the social conditions of the poor. His emergence at the 1958 World Cup, where he became a black global sporting star, was a source of inspiration. Throughout his career and in his retirement, Pelé received numerous individual and team awards for his performance on the field, his record-breaking achievements, and his legacy in the sport.","content":"#Early years\n#Club career\n##Santos\n###1956–1962: early years with Santos and declared a national treasure\n###1962–1965: Copa Libertadores success\n###1965–1974: O Milésimo and final years with Santos\n##Tours with Santos\n##New York Cosmos\n#International career\n##1958 World Cup\n##1959 South American Championship\n##1962 World Cup\n##1966 World Cup\n##1970 World Cup\n#Style of play\n#Legacy\n##Accolades\n##\"Pelé Pact\" and Puma sponsorship\n#Personal life\n##Relationships and children\n##Politics\n##Religion\n##Health\n#After football\n#Death and funeral\n#Career statistics\n##Club\n##International\n#Honours\n#Filmography\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}
{"title":"Avatar:_The_Way_of_Water","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Avatar:_The_Way_of_Water","summary":"Avatar: The Way of Water is a 2022 epic science fiction film co-produced, co-edited, and directed by James Cameron, who co-wrote the screenplay with Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver from a story the trio wrote with Josh Friedman and Shane Salerno. Distributed by 20th Century Studios, it is the sequel to Avatar (2009) and the second installment in the Avatar film series. It features Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldaña, Stephen Lang, Joel David Moore, CCH Pounder, Giovanni Ribisi, Dileep Rao and Matt Gerald reprising their roles from the first film, with Sigourney Weaver returning in an additional role and Kate Winslet joining the cast. It follows a blue-skinned humanoid Na'vi named Jake Sully (Worthington) as he and his family, under renewed human threat, seek refuge with the aquatic Metkayina clan of Pandora, a habitable exomoon on which they live.\nCameron said in 2006 that he would like to make sequels to Avatar if it were successful, and he announced the first two sequels in 2010, following the widespread success of the first film, with the first sequel aiming for a 2014 release. However, the addition of two more sequels, for a total of five Avatar films, and the necessity to develop new technology to film performance capture scenes underwater, a feat never accomplished before, led to significant delays to allow the crew more time to work on the writing, preproduction, and visual effects. The filming process, which occurred simultaneously with Avatar: Fire and Ash, began in Manhattan Beach, California, on August 15, 2017. The filming location moved to Wellington on September 25, 2017, which ended in late September 2020 after three years of shooting. With an estimated budget of $350–460 million, the film is one of the most expensive ever made.\nAfter repeated delays in release, Avatar: The Way of Water premiered at the Odeon Luxe Leicester Square in London on December 6, 2022, and was released in the United States on December 16. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the visual effects and technical achievements but criticized the plot and runtime. It was a major box office success, breaking multiple records, and grossing $2.320 billion worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film of 2022, the highest-grossing film since the COVID-19 pandemic, and the third-highest-grossing film of all time. The National Board of Review and the American Film Institute named The Way of Water one of the top-ten films of 2022. Among its many accolades, the film was nominated for four awards at the 95th Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and won for Best Visual Effects. Three further sequels are in production, with the next film, Avatar: Fire and Ash set to be released in December 2025.","content":"#Plot\n#Cast\n#Themes and analysis\n#Production\n##Development\n##Writing\n##Casting\n##Filming\n###Performance capture\n###Live-action\n##Visual effects\n##Runtime\n#Music\n#Marketing\n#Release\n##Home media\n#Reception\n##Box office\n###United States and Canada\n###China\n###Other territories\n##Critical response\n##Accolades\n#Sequels\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. The event was held as a two-night event, taking place on April 2 and 3, 2022, at the AT&T Stadium in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex city of Arlington, Texas.\nThe event was the fourth WrestleMania to be held in the state of Texas (after X-Seven, 25, and 32) and the second in AT&T Stadium after WrestleMania 32 in 2016. It was the third WrestleMania to feature Brock Lesnar vs. Roman Reigns in the main event (after 31 and 34). WWE billed the match as \"The Biggest WrestleMania Match of All-Time\", which was a Winner Takes All match for the promotion's two world championships, Raw's WWE Championship and SmackDown's Universal Championship, which were held by Lesnar and Reigns, respectively, going into the event. This would also be the last WrestleMania to take place under Vince McMahon's creative control, following his retirement on July 22; McMahon had served as chairman and chief executive officer of the company since 1982 and created WrestleMania in 1985, and although he returned to the company as Executive Chairman on January 10, 2023, he had no involvement in booking the event. McMahon’s involvement with the event in any capacity would come to an end as following a lawsuit in January 2024, McMahon resigned as Chairman of TKO Group Holdings, WWE’s parent company.\nThe card comprised a total of 16 matches, with seven on the first night and nine on the second. In an impromptu match that served as the main event for Night 1, \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin defeated Kevin Owens in a No Holds Barred match, marking Austin's first match since WrestleMania XIX in 2003 and the final match of his career overall. This encounter had originally been advertised as a special edition of Owens' \"KO Show\" with Austin as the special guest. Other prominent matches saw a returning Cody Rhodes defeat Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins, Charlotte Flair defeated Ronda Rousey to retain the SmackDown Women's Championship, and Bianca Belair defeated Becky Lynch to win the Raw Women's Championship, beginning her record-setting reign at 420 days. In the main event for Night 2, SmackDown's Universal Champion Roman Reigns defeated Raw's WWE Champion Brock Lesnar to claim both titles and become recognized as the Undisputed WWE Universal Champion. In other prominent matches, Jackass's Johnny Knoxville defeated Sami Zayn in an Anything Goes match and Edge defeated AJ Styles. Night 2 also featured WWE chairman Vince McMahon defeating SmackDown commentator Pat McAfee in an impromptu match after McAfee had defeated Austin Theory, marking McMahon's first match since 2012 and the last match of his career. Also on Night 2, the team of Sasha Banks and Naomi won the WWE Women's Tag Team Championship in a fatal four-way tag team match; this was Banks' final WWE pay-per-view match.\nThe event received mixed to positive reviews from critics, who praised the Raw Women's Championship, Raw Tag Team Championship match, Johnny Knoxville vs. Sami Zayn, Edge vs. AJ Styles, Pat McAfee's and Logan Paul's performance, Cody Rhodes vs. Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins, and the in-ring return of \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin while criticizing the main event for Night 2, Sheamus and Ridge Holland vs. The New Day, and panning Vince McMahon vs. McAfee.","content":"#Production\n##Background\n##Broadcast outlets\n##Celebrity involvement\n##Other WrestleMania Week events\n##Storylines\n###Main event matches\n###Undercard matches\n#Event\n##Night 1\n###Preliminary matches\n###Main event\n##Night 2\n###Preliminary matches\n###Main event\n#Reception\n#Aftermath\n##Raw\n##SmackDown\n#Results\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

The Mutiny Act, altered in 1803, and the Articles of War defined the nature and punishment of mutiny until the latter were replaced by the Army Discipline and Regulation Act 1879 (42 & 43 Vict. c. 33). In 1881, this was in turn replaced by the Army Act – An Act to consolidate the Army Discipline and Regulation Act, 1879, and the subsequent Acts amending the Same. This was extended or amended or consolidated annually (the most recent update having been made in 1995). Today, mutiny by British forces is punished under the Armed Forces Act 2006.\nDepending on events, additions, and changes within the established system more than one Mutiny Act might be passed within a given year.  Within the empire specific geographical disturbances were sometimes governed by specific Acts, such as the Mutiny, East Indies Act 1754 (27 Geo. 2. c. 9), or the Mutiny, America Act from 1765  (5 Geo. 3. c. 33) to 1776 (16 Geo. 3. c. 11).  A closely related series of Marine Mutiny Acts starting in 1755 (28 Geo. 2. c. 11) would regulate His Majesty's Marine Forces while on shore, and continue well into the 19th century.","content":"#Background\n#Passage of the first Mutiny Act\n#Renewal of the Mutiny Acts\n#The Quartering Acts\n#List\n##England\n##Great Britain\n##United Kingdom\n###1800s\n###1810s\n###1820s\n###1830s\n###1840s\n###1850s\n###1860s\n###1870s\n#Marine Mutiny Acts\n#See also\n#References\n","lang":"en"}

Soon after his arrival he began to put down roots, married, and became active in local politics, holding several positions in public office, including  membership in the North Carolina Assembly and thereafter a county Sheriff.\nDavis secured the position of the official printer for the colonial government of the North Carolina colony and was first to print its laws and paper currency. As an accomplished and official printer, Davis was later suspected by some of counterfeiting monetary notes, but the allegations were made by a career criminal, himself convicted of multiple counts of counterfeiting and thievery, while facing execution, and the allegations were never substantiated. Thereafter he went on serving as the colony's official printer and as a North Carolina justice of the peace.

D. Payne and Patrick McKay for the streaming service Amazon Prime Video. Based on J. R. R. Tolkien's history of Middle-earth, primarily material from the appendices of the novel The Lord of the Rings, the series is set thousands of years before the novel and depicts the major events of Middle-earth's Second Age. It is produced by Amazon MGM Studios in association with New Line Cinema.\nAmazon acquired the television rights for The Lord of the Rings from the Tolkien Estate in November 2017, making a five-season production commitment worth at least US$1 billion. This would make it the most expensive television series ever made. Payne and McKay were hired in July 2018 for their first credited roles. They developed the story by bridging Second Age references in the appendices with original material, in consultation with the estate and Tolkien lore experts. Per the requirements of Amazon's deal with the estate, the series is not a continuation of Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit film trilogies. Despite this, the producers intended to evoke the films using similar production design, younger versions of film characters, and a main theme by Howard Shore who composed the music for both film trilogies. Bear McCreary composed the series' original score.\nA large international cast was hired and filming for the eight-episode first season took place in New Zealand, where the films were produced, from February 2020 to August 2021. This included a production break of several months due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Amazon moved production for future seasons to the United Kingdom. Filming for the second season took place there from October 2022 to June 2023, finishing amid the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike. Work on a potential third season has begun.\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power premiered on September 1, 2022. The first season was released through October, and was the most-watched of any Prime Video original series according to Amazon. It received generally positive reviews from critics, particularly for its visuals and designs, but there were criticisms for the writing and pacing.

{"title":"Top_Gun:_Maverick","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Top_Gun:_Maverick","summary":"Top Gun: Maverick is a 2022 American action drama film directed by Joseph Kosinski and written by Ehren Kruger, Eric Warren Singer, and Christopher McQuarrie from stories by Peter Craig and Justin Marks. The film is a sequel to the 1986 film Top Gun. Tom Cruise reprises his starring role as the naval aviator Maverick. It is based on the characters of the original film created by Jim Cash and Jack Epps Jr. It also stars Miles Teller, Jennifer Connelly, Jon Hamm, Glen Powell, Monica Barbaro, Lewis Pullman, Ed Harris and Val Kilmer, who reprises his role as Iceman. The story involves Maverick confronting his past while training a group of younger Top Gun graduates, including the son of his deceased best friend, for a dangerous mission.\nDevelopment of a Top Gun sequel was announced in 2010 by Paramount Pictures. Tom Cruise, along with producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Tony Scott, were asked to return. Craig wrote a draft of the screenplay in 2012, but the project stalled when Scott died later that year. Top Gun: Maverick was later dedicated to Scott's memory. Production resumed in 2017, after Kosinski was hired to direct. Principal photography, which involved the use of IMAX-certified 6K full-frame cameras, took place from May 2018 to April 2019 in California, Washington and Maryland. It was initially scheduled to be released July 12, 2019, but it was delayed several times due to its complex action sequences and later the COVID-19 pandemic. During the pandemic, several streaming companies attempted to purchase the streaming rights to the film from Paramount, but all offers were declined on the orders of Cruise, who insisted that it be released exclusively in theaters.\nTop Gun: Maverick premiered at CinemaCon on April 28, 2022, and was theatrically released by Paramount Pictures in the United States on May 27, 2022. It was acclaimed by critics, with many considering it superior to the first film. It won Best Film from the National Board of Review and was also named one of the top-ten films of 2022 by the American Film Institute. The film was nominated for six awards at the 95th Academy Awards (including Best Picture), winning Best Sound, and received numerous other accolades. It grossed $1.496 billion worldwide, making it the second-highest-grossing film of 2022 and the highest-grossing of Cruise's career. A sequel is in development.","content":"#Plot\n#Cast\n#Production\n##Development\n##Writing\n##Casting\n##Filming\n##Aircraft\n###Darkstar\n###F-14\n##Post-production\n#Music\n#Marketing\n#Release\n##Theatrical\n##Home media\n#Reception\n##Box office\n##Critical response\n###Industry response\n##Role of the U.S. military\n##Accolades\n#Lawsuit\n#Future\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}
{"title":"Chris_Rock–Will_Smith_slapping_incident","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Chris_Rock–Will_Smith_slapping_incident","summary":"During the 94th Academy Awards on March 27, 2022, actor Will Smith walked onstage and slapped comedian Chris Rock across the face during Rock's presentation for Best Documentary Feature. The slap was in response to an unscripted joke Rock made about Smith's wife Jada Pinkett Smith's shaved head, which was a result of alopecia: Rock said that he \"can't wait to see\" Pinkett Smith in a sequel to G.I. Jane, in which Demi Moore's titular character has a shaved head. Smith then returned to his seat and shouted profanity twice at Rock, who briefly responded before completing his presentation without further interruption.\nLater that evening, Smith won Best Actor for his role in King Richard. In his acceptance speech, he apologized to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) and other nominees, but not to Rock. The next day, he issued an apology to Rock and the AMPAS through social media. Smith resigned his Academy membership on April 1, facing a potential suspension or expulsion, and was banned from attending AMPAS events for 10 years.\nLive television broadcasts in the United States mostly muted the incident due to federal censorship laws. However, uncensored international footage went viral on social media; an excerpt from the Australian broadcast became one of the most-viewed online videos in the first 24 hours. The incident received worldwide attention and largely overshadowed the rest of the ceremony.","content":"#Background\n#Incident\n##Photograph\n##Uncensored viewership\n##Additional videos\n#Aftermath\n##Initial response\n##Public apologies\n##Formal Academy review\n##Resignation and ban\n##Smith film delayed\n##Later responses\n#Reactions\n##Crew of Summer of Soul\n##Individuals\n##Comedians\n##Politicians\n##Accusations of staging\n##Alopecia awareness\n##Views on criminality\n##Memes\n#Analysis\n##Potential causes\n##Comparisons with historic Academy incidents\n##Financial impact\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}
{"title":"Georgia_election_racketeering_prosecution","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Georgia_election_racketeering_prosecution","summary":"The State of Georgia v. Donald J. Trump, et al. is a pending criminal case against Donald Trump, the 45th president of the United States, and 18 co-defendants. The prosecution alleges that Trump led a \"criminal racketeering enterprise\", in which he and all other defendants \"knowingly and willfully joined a conspiracy to unlawfully change the outcome\" of the 2020 U.S. presidential election in Georgia. All defendants are charged with one count of violating Georgia's Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) statute, which has a penalty of five to twenty years in prison. The indictment comes in the context of Trump's broader effort to overturn his loss in the 2020 presidential election.\nThe case, one of four criminal indictments against Trump, is paused while the Georgia Court of Appeals decides whether to disqualify Fani Willis. A hearing on that matter is scheduled for December 2024.\nFour defendants pleaded guilty to some charges, agreed to cooperate with the prosecution, and received sentences including probation, fines, and making public apologies. The date of trial for the remaining fifteen defendants (who pleaded not guilty) is not yet set.\nDefendants are variously charged with forty additional counts from other allegations, including: Trump and co-defendants plotted to create pro-Trump slates of fake electors; Trump called the Georgia Secretary of State, Brad Raffensperger, asking him to \"find 11,780 votes\", which would have reversed his loss in the state by a single vote margin; and a small group of Trump allies in Coffee County illegally accessed voting systems attempting to find evidence of election fraud.\nFollowing an investigation launched in February 2021 by Fulton County district attorney Fani Willis, a grand jury of 23 citizens handed up the indictments on August 14, 2023. The case was set to be heard in the Fulton County Superior Court with judge Scott F. McAfee presiding. Another judge denied requests from former Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows, former Department of Justice (DOJ) official Jeffrey Clark, and three other defendants to have their cases removed to federal court.","content":"#Background\n##Prior to and during election day\n##Efforts to pressure Georgia state officials\n##Creation of false electoral vote documents\n##Coffee County election equipment breach\n##Harassment of Fulton County election workers\n#Indictment\n##Charges\n##Defendants\n#Initial proceedings\n##Surrender and booking\n##Arraignments\n#Pretrial motions\n##Attempts to dismiss charges\n##Attempts to remove to federal court\n##Speedy trial and severance requests\n##Dismissal of solicitation and false documents charges\n#Proceedings on prosecutorial impropriety\n##Background\n##Hearing\n##Ruling and aftermath\n##Appeal to dismiss Fani Willis from the case\n#Guilty pleas\n##Proffer video leak\n#Trials\n##Date and duration\n##Procedures and potential witnesses\n#Reactions\n#Notes\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n##Federal removal dockets\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"2023_Atlantic_hurricane_season","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2023_Atlantic_hurricane_season","summary":"The 2023 Atlantic hurricane season was the fourth-most active Atlantic hurricane season on record in terms of storms with 20 named storms forming, tied with 1933. Among them, 7 became hurricanes, with 3 reaching major hurricane strength. The season also had an above‑normal accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 148, despite the presence of the 2023–24 El Niño event, which typically results in less activity, and had the most storms for an El Niño year on record, largely due to record-warm sea surface temperatures across the Atlantic. The season officially began on June 1 and ended on November 30. These dates, adopted by convention, historically describe the period in each year when most tropical cyclogenesis occurs in the Atlantic. However, the formation of subtropical or tropical cyclones is possible at any time of the year, as demonstrated by the formation of a subtropical storm on January 16, the earliest start of an Atlantic hurricane season since Hurricane Alex in January 2016. Because the system was operationally assessed as non-tropical by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) and designated after the fact, it went without a name.\nJune saw two tropical storms—Bret and Cindy—form in the tropical Atlantic (south of 23.5°N, east of 60°W) for the first time on record. The former made landfall on Saint Vincent. An unprecedented stretch of activity commenced in late August. Tropical Storm Harold struck southern Texas on August 22, and Hurricane Franklin made landfall in the Dominican Republic as a tropical storm the following day, with the latter reaching peak intensity as a high-end Category 4 hurricane and bringing tropical-storm-force winds to Bermuda. After briefly attaining Category 4 strength on August 30, Hurricane Idalia made landfall in Florida as a Category 3 hurricane. In early September, Hurricane Lee rapidly intensified into a Category 5 hurricane, then later made multiple landfalls in Atlantic Canada as a strong extratropical cyclone. Later that month, Tropical Storm Ophelia made landfall in North Carolina. In October, both Tropical Storm Philippe, the longest-lived tropical cyclone in the Atlantic this year, and Hurricane Tammy made landfall on Barbuda. Also that month, Tropical Depression Twenty‑One made landfall in Nicaragua. With Tammy's dissipation on October 28, the season effectively ended, as no tropical cyclones formed thereafter. The systems of this season collectively produced at least $4.2 billion (USD) in damage, and caused 20 fatalities.\nDespite the above-normal activity this season, El Niño‑enhanced wind shear prevented most storms from significantly strengthening. Additionally, the El Niño event weakened the Bermuda High, allowing systems to curve northward or take more easterly tracks out to sea, as opposed to being pushed westward towards the continental United States, Mexico, or Central America. As a result, only a few systems impacted land or caused significant damage this season, with just three making landfall in the U.S. For the first time since the 2014 season, no names were retired this year by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).","content":"#Seasonal forecasts\n##Pre-season forecasts\n##Mid-season forecasts\n#Seasonal summary\n##Background\n##Early activity\n##Peak to late activity\n#Systems\n##Unnamed subtropical storm\n##Tropical Storm Arlene\n##Tropical Storm Bret\n##Tropical Storm Cindy\n##Hurricane Don\n##Tropical Storm Gert\n##Tropical Storm Emily\n##Hurricane Franklin\n##Tropical Storm Harold\n##Hurricane Idalia\n##Tropical Storm Jose\n##Tropical Storm Katia\n##Hurricane Lee\n##Hurricane Margot\n##Hurricane Nigel\n##Tropical Storm Ophelia\n##Tropical Storm Philippe\n##Tropical Storm Rina\n##Tropical Storm Sean\n##Hurricane Tammy\n##Tropical Depression Twenty-One\n##Other system\n#Storm names\n#Season effects\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

The earthquake's epicenter was 73.4 km (45.6 mi) southwest of Marrakesh, near the town of Ighil and the Oukaïmeden ski resort in the Atlas Mountains. It occurred as a result of shallow oblique-thrust faulting beneath the mountain range. At least 2,960 deaths were reported, with most occurring outside Marrakesh. Damage was widespread, and historic landmarks in Marrakesh were destroyed. The earthquake was also felt in Spain, Portugal, and Algeria.\nIt is the strongest instrumentally recorded earthquake in Morocco, the deadliest in the country since the 1960 Agadir earthquake, and the second-deadliest earthquake of 2023 after the Turkey–Syria earthquakes.

{"title":"Ayutthaya_Kingdom","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ayutthaya_Kingdom","summary":"The Ayutthaya Kingdom or the Empire of Ayutthaya was a Mon and later Siamese kingdom that existed in Southeast Asia from 1351 to 1767, centered around the city of Ayutthaya, in Siam, or present-day Thailand. European travellers in the early 16th century called Ayutthaya one of the three great powers of Asia (alongside Vijayanagara and China). The Ayutthaya Kingdom is considered to be the precursor of modern Thailand, and its developments are an important part of the history of Thailand.\nThe Ayutthaya Kingdom emerged from the mandala or merger of three maritime city-states on the Lower Chao Phraya Valley in the late 13th and 14th centuries (Lopburi, Suphanburi, and Ayutthaya). The early kingdom was a maritime confederation, oriented to post-Srivijaya Maritime Southeast Asia, conducting raids and tribute from these maritime states. After two centuries of political organization from the Northern Cities and a transition to a hinterland state, Ayutthaya centralized and became one of the great powers of Asia. From 1569 to 1584, Ayutthaya was a vassal state of Toungoo Burma, but quickly regained independence. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Ayutthaya emerged as an entrepôt of international trade and its cultures flourished. The reign of Narai (r. 1657–1688) was known for Persian and later, European, influence and the sending of the 1686 Siamese embassy to the French court of King Louis XIV. The Late Ayutthaya Period saw the departure of the French and English but growing prominence of the Chinese. The period was described as a \"golden age\" of Siamese culture and saw the rise in Chinese trade and the introduction of capitalism into Siam, a development that would continue to expand in the centuries following the fall of Ayutthaya.\nAyutthaya's failure to create a peaceful order of succession and the introduction of capitalism undermined the traditional organization of its elite and the old bonds of labor control which formed the military and government organization of the kingdom. In the mid-18th century, the Burmese Konbaung dynasty invaded Ayutthaya in 1759–1760 and 1765–1767. In April 1767, after a 14-month siege, the city of Ayutthaya fell to besieging Burmese forces and was completely destroyed, thereby ending the 417-year-old Ayutthaya Kingdom. Siam, however, quickly recovered from the collapse and the seat of Siamese authority was moved to Thonburi-Bangkok within the next 15 years.\nIn foreign accounts, Ayutthaya was called \"Siam\", but people of Ayutthaya called themselves Tai, and their kingdom Krung Tai (Thai: กรุงไท) meaning 'Tai country' (กรุงไท). It was also referred to as Iudea in a painting requested by the Dutch East India Company. The capital city of Ayutthaya is officially known as Krung Thep Dvaravati Si Ayutthaya (Thai: กรุงเทพทวารวดีศรีอยุธยา), as documented in historical sources.","content":"#History\n##Origins\n###Pre-Ayutthaya cities\n###The traditional founding of Ayutthaya\n##Early maritime dominance\n##Age of warfare\n###Transition to a hinterland state\n###Centralization and dominance of the Northern lords\n###First Burmese wars\n##Peace and commerce\n###Later Phitsanulok dynasty to early Prasat Thong dynasty\n###Persian and French influences\n##Late Ayutthaya period\n###Continued prosperity and increased Chinese connections\n###Succession conflicts and corruption\n###Introduction of capitalism, rise of commoners, and proto-nationalism\n###Nobility and Buddhism\n###Military and political situation to 1759\n##Fall of Ayutthaya\n###Aftermath\n#Government\n##Kings\n##Mandala system\n#Political development\n##Social classes\n##Ranking of social classes\n##Military\n##Territory\n#Culture and society\n##Population\n##Language\n##Religion\n##Arts and performances\n##Literature\n###Sanskrit influence on the Siamese language\n###Ramakien\n###Khun Chang Khun Phaen: the Siamese epic folk poem\n##Architecture\n##Notable archeological sites\n##Daily life\n###Clothing\n#Economy\n##Trade and currency\n##Ayutthaya as international trading port\n###Contacts with the West\n###Contacts with East Asia\n###Notable foreigners in 17th century Ayutthaya\n#Historiography\n##Contemporary accounts of Ayutthaya\n##Post-Ayutthaya historiography\n##The \"General Crisis\" hypothesis\n#Gallery\n#In popular culture\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#General references\n#Further reading\n##General works\n##Royal Chronicles of Ayutthaya\n##Burmese accounts\n##Western accounts\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Russo-Ukrainian_War","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Russo-Ukrainian_War","summary":"The ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War began in February 2014. Following Ukraine's Revolution of Dignity, Russia occupied and annexed Crimea from Ukraine and supported pro-Russian separatists fighting the Ukrainian military in the Donbas War. These first eight years of conflict also included naval incidents and cyberwarfare. In February 2022, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine and began occupying more of the country, starting the biggest conflict in Europe since World War II. The war has resulted in a refugee crisis and tens of thousands of deaths.\nIn early 2014, the Euromaidan protests led to the Revolution of Dignity and the ousting of Ukraine's pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych. Shortly after, pro-Russian unrest erupted in eastern and southern Ukraine, while unmarked Russian troops occupied Crimea. Russia soon annexed Crimea after a highly disputed referendum. In April 2014, Russian-backed militants seized towns in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region and proclaimed the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) and the Luhansk People's Republic (LPR) as independent states, starting the Donbas war. Russia covertly supported the separatists with its own troops, tanks and artillery, preventing Ukraine from fully retaking the territory. In February 2015, Russia and Ukraine signed the Minsk II agreements, but they were never fully implemented in the years that followed. The Donbas war settled into a violent but static conflict between Ukraine and the Russian and separatist forces, with many brief ceasefires but no lasting peace and few changes in territorial control.\nBeginning in 2021, there was a massive Russian military buildup near Ukraine's borders, including within neighbouring Belarus. Russian officials repeatedly denied plans to attack Ukraine. Russia's president Vladimir Putin expressed irredentist views and denied Ukraine's right to exist. He demanded that Ukraine be barred from ever joining the NATO military alliance. In early 2022, Russia recognized the DPR and LPR as independent states.\nOn 24 February 2022, Putin announced a \"special military operation\" to \"demilitarize and denazify\" Ukraine, claiming Russia had no plans to occupy the country. The Russian invasion that followed was internationally condemned; many countries imposed sanctions against Russia, and sent humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine. In the face of fierce resistance, Russia abandoned an attempt to take Kyiv in early April. From August, Ukrainian forces began recapturing territories in the north-east and south. In late September, Russia declared the annexation of four partially-occupied provinces, which was internationally condemned. Since then, Russian offensives and Ukrainian counteroffensives have gained only small amounts of territory.

It was the third tropical depression, and the second tropical storm of the 2022 Pacific typhoon season. Megi originated from an area of convection in the Philippine Sea where it slowly tracked northwestward into Leyte Gulf, where it remained almost stationary, slowly tracking to the east. Megi made two landfalls, one in Calicoan Island in Guiuan, and another in Basey, Samar. It continued to track southwestward and reentered the Philippine Sea before dissipating.\nHeavy rains and gales led to the sinking of two ships. Major landslides pushed mud over villages in Leyte, burying around 210 houses. As of April 29, 2022, the Philippines' National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) has reported 214 deaths, 132 missing, and 8 injured. The Department of Agriculture estimates worth ₱3.27 billion in agricultural damages, and the Department of Public Works and Highways estimates worth ₱1.45 billion in infrastructural damages, for a total of ₱4.72 billion (US$90.8 million).

{"title":"118th_United_States_Congress","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/118th_United_States_Congress","summary":"The 118th United States Congress is the current meeting of the legislative branch of the United States federal government, composed of the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives. It convened in Washington, D.C., on January 3, 2023, and will end on January 3, 2025, during the third and fourth years of President Joe Biden's term in office.\nIn the 2022 midterm elections, the Republican Party won control of the House 222–213, taking the majority for the first time since the 115th Congress, while the Democratic Party gained one seat in the Senate, where they already had effective control, and giving them a 51–49-seat majority (with a caucus of 48 Democrats and three independents). With Republicans winning the House, the 118th Congress ended the federal government trifecta Democrats held in the 117th.\nThis congress also features the first female Senate president pro tempore (Patty Murray), the first Black party leader (Hakeem Jeffries) in congressional history, and the longest-serving Senate party leaders (Mitch McConnell and Dick Durbin). The Senate has the highest number of Independent members in a single Congress since the ratification of the 17th Amendment after Joe Manchin left the Democratic Party to become an Independent.\nThe 118th Congress has been characterized as a uniquely ineffectual Congress, with its most notable events pointing towards political dysfunction. The intense gridlock, particularly in the Republican-controlled House, where the Republican Conference's majority was often undercut by internal disputes amongst its members, resulted in it passing the lowest number of laws for the first year of session since the Richard Nixon administration, and possibly ever. This resulted in the need for a legislative coalition to pass key legislation allowing the minority to exercise powers usually reserved for the majority. The fractuous session demotivated many veteran legislators, with five committee chairs amongst the dozens declaring resignations before the end of the session, three of whom were eligible to reprise their positions if the Republican Party retained their majority for 2025. A higher-than-average number of retiring lawmakers were those attempting to pass bipartisan and collaborative legislation. Two complete discharge petitions were filed in late 2024, both Republican-led with majority Democratic support, demonstrating a trend towards bucking leadership and lack of party discipline; such a gambit was last successful in 2015 to support the Export–Import Bank.\nThe Congress began with a multi-ballot election for Speaker of the House, which had not happened since the 68th Congress in 1923. Kevin McCarthy was eventually elected speaker on the 15th ballot. After relying on bipartisan votes to get out of a debt ceiling crisis and government shutdown threats, McCarthy became the first speaker to ever be removed from the role during a legislative session on October 3, 2023. Following three failed attempts by various representatives to fill the post, on October 25, Mike Johnson was elected as speaker. Johnson would advance four more bipartisan continuing resolutions from November into March to avoid shutdowns. Congress finalized the 2024 United States federal budget on March 23, 2024, through two separate minibus packages. Following a contentious foreign-aid vote, a motion to remove Johnson from the speakership was defeated in a bipartisan vote.\nPartisan disciplinary actions have also increased. With the expulsion of New York Representative George Santos from the House in December 2023 over the opposition of the Speaker, this was the first congress since the 107th in which a member was expelled, and the first ever in which a Republican was. There was also an increase of censures passed in the House, being the first congress with multiple censures since the 1983 congressional page sex scandal and the most in one year since 1870. In December 2023, House Republicans authorized an impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden, followed by the impeachment of Alejandro Mayorkas in February 2024, the first time a cabinet secretary has been the target of impeachment proceedings since William W. Belknap in 1876, and only the second such cabinet impeachment in history. The charges were dismissed by the Senate, the first time the Senate dismissed impeachment articles without trial after the reading.","content":"#Major events\n#Major legislation\n##Enacted\n##Proposed (but not enacted)\n#Major resolutions\n##Adopted\n##Proposed\n##Vetoed\n#Party summary\n##Senate\n##House of Representatives\n#Leadership\n##Senate\n###Presiding\n###Majority (Democratic)\n###Minority (Republican)\n##House of Representatives\n###Presiding\n###Majority (Republican)\n###Minority (Democratic)\n#Members\n##Senate\n##House of Representatives\n#Changes in membership\n##Senate changes\n##House of Representatives changes\n#Committees\n##Senate committees\n###Standing committees\n###Select, permanent select and special committees\n##House of Representatives committees\n##Joint committees\n#Officers and officials\n##Congressional officers\n##Senate officers\n##House of Representatives officers\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n","lang":"en"}

It features an ensemble cast that includes Brad Pitt, Margot Robbie, Diego Calva, Jean Smart, Jovan Adepo and Li Jun Li. It chronicles the rise and fall of multiple characters during Hollywood's transition from silent to sound films in the late 1920s.\nChazelle began developing Babylon in July 2019, with Lionsgate Films as the frontrunner to acquire the project. It was announced that Paramount Pictures had acquired worldwide rights in November 2019. Much of the main cast joined the project between January 2020 and August 2021, and filming took place in Los Angeles from July to October 2021.\nBabylon premiered at the Samuel Goldwyn Theater in Los Angeles on November 14, 2022, and was released in the United States on December 23, 2022. It was met with a polarized response from critics and was a box-office bomb, grossing $63 million against a production budget of $78–80 million and losing Paramount $87 million.

{"title":"Fuzzball_(string_theory)","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fuzzball_(string_theory)","summary":"Fuzzballs are hypothetical objects in superstring theory, intended to provide a fully quantum description of the black holes predicted by general relativity.\nThe fuzzball hypothesis dispenses with the singularity at the heart of a black hole by positing that the entire region within the black hole's event horizon is actually an extended object: a ball of strings, which are advanced as the ultimate building blocks of matter and light. Under string theory, strings are bundles of energy vibrating in complex ways in both the three familiar dimensions of space as well as in extra dimensions. Fuzzballs provide resolutions to two major open problems in black hole physics. First, they avoid the gravitational singularity that exists within the event horizon of a black hole. General relativity predicts that at the singularity, the curvature of spacetime becomes infinite, and it cannot determine the fate of matter and energy that falls into it. Physicists generally believe that the singularity is not a real phenomenon, and proposed theories of quantum gravity, such as superstring theory, are expected to explain its true nature. Second, they resolve the black hole information paradox: the quantum information of matter falling into a black hole is trapped behind the event horizon, and seems to disappear from the universe entirely when the black hole evaporates due to Hawking radiation. This would violate a fundamental law of quantum mechanics requiring that quantum information be conserved.\nAs no direct experimental evidence supports either string theory in general or fuzzballs in particular, both are products purely of calculations and theoretical research. However, the existence of fuzzballs may be testable through gravitational-wave astronomy.","content":"#Physical properties\n##String theory and composition\n##Densities\n##Neutron star collapse\n#Information paradox\n#Testability of the theory\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

Opposition candidate Yoon Suk Yeol of the People Power Party won the election, defeating candidate Lee Jae-myung of the incumbent Democratic Party.\nBoth main parties had unusually intense primary elections. Upon its nomination of Lee Jae-myung, the second-place Democratic Party candidate Lee Nak-yon called for an appeal of the results, until being forced to concede. In the PPP, frontrunner Yoon and party chairman Lee Jun-seok frequently clashed over Yoon's performance and perceived apathy towards debates with other candidates. The People Party nominated Ahn Cheol-soo and the Justice Party nominated Sim Sang-jung.\nEconomic inequality, recovery from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, antifeminist sentiment and housing issues were prominent topics during the election. Analysts observed increased political polarization, record low popularity amongst the candidates, infighting within both main political parties, as well as a negative or divisive tone throughout campaigning. After discussing a potential merger for some time, Ahn withdrew his campaign on 3 March, 6 days before the election, and endorsed Yoon.\nIn the closest presidential election in South Korean history, Yoon won the most overall votes and the key areas of Seoul, but lost in Gyeonggi and Incheon.","content":"#Background\n#Electoral system\n#Nominations\n##Democratic Party\n###Primary campaign\n###Primary schedule and process\n####Primary results\n###Candidate\n###Other primary candidates\n###Eliminated candidates\n###Withdrawn candidates\n##People Power Party\n###Primary campaign\n####Primary results\n###Candidate\n###Other candidates\n###Withdrawn candidates\n###Did not run\n##Justice Party\n###Candidate\n###Other primary candidates\n##People Party\n###Candidate\n##Minor party candidates\n#Registered candidates\n#Opinion polling\n#Campaign developments\n##Campaign issues\n##Negative campaigning and candidate unpopularity\n##Recruitment of left-wing feminists to the conservative camps\n##Infighting in Yoon's campaign team and PPP\n##Sim Sang-jung suspends campaign activities\n##Bus accident deaths involving Ahn Cheol-soo's campaigners\n##Ahn's withdrawal from the campaign, endorsing Yoon Suk-yeol\n##Attack against Song Young-gil\n#Voting\n#Exit polls\n#Results\n##By region\n###Major candidates\n###Minor candidates\n#Aftermath\n#Notes\n","lang":"en"}

The elections took place following the passage of controversial electoral amendments.\nIn addition to a struggling economy, significant campaign issues included the national debt, ethnic tensions and tackling poverty. During the preliminary count, the Fijian Elections Office (FEO) app displaying the results experienced a glitch, prompting FEO to take down the app temporarily. Once the app was back in operation, the vote tally showed the ruling FijiFirst party leading, resulting in five opposition parties demanding a recount and for the counting process to cease. Observers said they had not seen any significant voting irregularities, adding that an initial anomaly with an app showing the results had been rectified. \nOf the nine parties that contested the election, four passed the 5% threshold needed to enter parliament, but no party won a majority. FijiFirst won a plurality, securing 26 seats. The newly formed People's Alliance (PA) secured 21 seats, while its coalition partner, the National Federation Party (NFP), won five. The Social Democratic Liberal Party (SODELPA), which placed second in the 2018 election, retained three seats.\nNegotiations to form a government began following the election, with FijiFirst and the PA-NFP coalition seeking to win over the kingmaker SODELPA. After several days, on 20 December, SODELPA's management board voted to form a coalition government with the People's Alliance and the NFP, ending the FijiFirst government's eight-year rule and Bainimarama's 16-year tenure as prime minister. The ruling FijiFirst party refused to concede the election, instead waiting for MPs to elect the new prime minister during the first session of parliament. This session, scheduled for 21 December, was delayed, as no public announcement came from the President. SODELPA's management board met for a second time on 23 December and again voted to form a government with the PA-NFP coalition. \nPresident Katonivere called for the first parliamentary session since the election in the morning of 24 December. Naiqama Lalabalavu was elected and confirmed as Speaker by parliament garnering 28 votes of the 55 cast. Sitiveni Rabuka was elected and confirmed as prime minister by parliament on the same day garnering 28 votes of the 55 cast, officially ending Frank Bainimarama's 16-year tenure as prime minister and cementing the PA-NFP-SODELPA government.

{"title":"Tartan","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tartan","summary":"Tartan (Scottish Gaelic: breacan [ˈpɾʲɛxkən]) is a patterned cloth with crossing horizontal and vertical bands in multiple colours, forming simple or complex rectangular patterns. Tartans originated in woven wool, but are now made in other materials. Tartan is particularly associated with Scotland, and Scottish kilts almost always have tartan patterns. The earliest surviving samples of tartan-style cloth are around 3,000 years old and were discovered in Xinjiang, China.\nOutside of Scotland, tartan is sometimes also known as \"plaid\" (particularly in North America); however, in Scotland, a plaid is a large piece of tartan cloth which can be worn several ways.\nTraditional tartan is made with alternating bands of coloured (pre-dyed) threads woven in usually matching warp and weft in a simple 2\/2 twill pattern. Up close, this pattern forms alternating short diagonal lines where different colours cross; from further back, it gives the appearance of new colours blended from the original ones. The resulting blocks of colour repeat vertically and horizontally in a distinctive pattern of rectangles and lines known as a sett.\nScottish tartan was originally associated with the Highlands. Early tartans were only particular to locales, rather than any specific Scottish clan; however, because clans lived in and controlled particular districts and regions, then informally, people could roughly identify certain clans and families through the patterns associated with their own locality. Like other materials, tartan designs were produced by local weavers for local tastes, using the most available natural dyes. \nThe Dress Act of 1746 attempted to bring the warrior clans there under government control by banning Highland dress for all civilian men and boys in the Highlands, as it was then an important element of Gaelic Scottish culture. \nWhen the law was repealed in 1782, tartan was no longer ordinary dress for most Highlanders. It was adopted more widely as the symbolic national dress of all Scotland when King George IV wore a tartan kilt in his 1822 visit to Scotland; it was promoted further by Queen Victoria. This marked an era of rather politicised \"tartanry\" and \"Highlandism\".\nWhile the first uniform tartan is believed to date to 1713 (with some evidence of militia use earlier), it was not until around the early 19th century that patterns were created for specific Scottish clans; most of the traditional ones were established between 1815 and 1850. The Victorian-era invention of artificial dyes meant that a multitude of patterns could be produced cheaply; mass-produced tartan fashion cloth was applied to a nostalgic (and increasingly aristocratic, and profitable) view of Scottish history.\nToday tartan is no longer limited to textiles, but is also used as a name for the pattern itself, regardless of medium. The use of tartan has spread outside Scotland, especially to countries that have been influenced by Scottish culture. However, tartan-styled patterns have existed for centuries in some other cultures, such as Japan, where complex kōshi fabrics date to at least the 18th century, and Russia (sometimes with gold and silver thread) since at least the early 19th century. Maasai shúkà wraps, Bhutanese mathra weaving, and Indian madras cloth are also often in tartan patterns, distinct from the Scottish style.","content":"#Etymology and terminology\n#Weaving and design\n##Weaving construction\n##Styles and design principles\n##Colour, palettes, and meaning\n#Early history\n##Pre-medieval origins\n##Medieval\n##16th century\n##17th century\n##18th century\n###Union protest and Jacobite rebellion\n###Proscription and its aftermath\n#Regimental tartans\n#Clan tartans\n##Long-running debate\n##Earliest evidence\n##Lack of further evidence of early adoption\n##19th century broad adoption\n##20th century consolidation\n##Recognition by clan chiefs\n#Modern general use\n##Late Georgian\n###The King's jaunt in tartan\n###Civilian spread\n##Victorian\n###Vestiarium Scoticum\n###The Queen and \"Balmorality\"\n###Ripple effects\n##20th century to present\n###Diaspora and globalisation\n###Industry and politics\n###In popular culture\n#Popular designs\n#Tartans for specific purposes\n##Regional\n##Hunting, mourning, dress, and dance\n##Family and individual\n##Corporate and commercial\n###Fashion\n#Regulation\n##Registration\n##Legal protection\n##Etiquette\n#In other cultures\n##Africa\n###Maasai shúkà\n##East and South Asia\n###Bhutanese mathra\n###Indian madras\n###Japanese kōshi\n##Eastern Europe to Western Asia\n###Russian shotlandka\n##Oceania\n###Adoption by the Māori\n#See also\n##Patterns\n#Notes\n#References\n##Citations\n##Sources\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

To allow delegates to make compromises and changes without speculation from the public and newspapers it was decided that the debates and drafting during the Convention be conducted in secret, which is why definitive accounts of the Convention did not appear until 1840, while many books on the Constitution begin after the Convention of 1787. On September 17, 1787, the new Constitution was signed by the delegates, and ratified the following year, which established the government of the United States in March 1789.

He rose to prominence as a pioneer of the French New Wave film movement of the 1960s, alongside such filmmakers as François Truffaut, Agnès Varda, Éric Rohmer and Jacques Demy. He was arguably the most influential French filmmaker of the post-war era. According to AllMovie, his work \"revolutionized the motion picture form\" through its experimentation with narrative, continuity, sound, and camerawork. His most acclaimed films include Breathless (1960), Vivre sa vie (1962), Contempt (1963), Band of Outsiders (1964), Alphaville (1965), Pierrot le Fou (1965), Masculin Féminin (1966), Weekend (1967) and Goodbye to Language (2014).\nDuring his early career as a film critic for the influential magazine Cahiers du Cinéma, Godard criticised mainstream French cinema's \"Tradition of Quality\", which de-emphasised innovation and experimentation. In response, he and like-minded critics began to make their own films, challenging the conventions of traditional Hollywood in addition to French cinema. Godard first received global acclaim for his 1960 feature Breathless, helping to establish the New Wave movement. His work makes use of frequent homages and references to film history, and often expressed his political views; he was an avid reader of existentialism and Marxist philosophy, and in 1969 formed the Dziga Vertov Group with other radical filmmakers to promote political works. After the New Wave, his politics were less radical, and his later films came to be about human conflict and artistic representation \"from a humanist rather than Marxist perspective.\"\nGodard was married three times, to actresses Anna Karina and Anne Wiazemsky, both of whom starred in several of his films, and later to his longtime partner Anne-Marie Miéville. His collaborations with Karina—which included such critically acclaimed films as Vivre sa vie (1962), Bande à part (1964) and Pierrot le Fou (1965)—were called \"arguably the most influential body of work in the history of cinema\" by Filmmaker magazine. In a 2002 Sight & Sound poll, Godard ranked third in the critics' top ten directors of all time. He is said to have \"generated one of the largest bodies of critical analysis of any filmmaker since the mid-twentieth century.\" His work has been central to narrative theory and has \"challenged both commercial narrative cinema norms and film criticism's vocabulary.\" In 2010, Godard was awarded an Academy Honorary Award.","content":"#Early life\n#Early career (1950–1959)\n##Film criticism\n##Filmmaking\n#New Wave period (1960–1967)\n##Breathless\n##Early work with Anna Karina\n##Vivre sa vie\n##Le petit soldat and Les Carabiniers\n##Contempt\n##Anouchka Films\n##Week End\n#Political period (1968–1979)\n##Vietnam War\n##Bertolt Brecht\n##Marxism\n##Revolutionary period (1968–1979)\n##Films\n##Sonimage\n##Jean-Pierre Gorin\n##Dziga Vertov Group\n#Return to commercial films and Histoire(s) du cinéma (1980–2000)\n#Late period films (2001–2022)\n#Personal life and death\n#Legacy\n#Selected filmography\n#Collaboration with ECM Records\n#See also\n#References\n#Sources and further reading\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

He retired from international cricket at the end of Australia's 2006–07 Ashes series victory over England.\nWarne revolutionised cricket thinking with his mastery of leg spin, then regarded as a dying art. After retirement, he regularly worked as a cricket commentator and for charities and endorsed commercial products. During his career, Warne was involved in off-field scandals including a ban from cricket for testing positive for a prohibited substance, a colourful personal life and interactions with gambling figures.\nWarne died suddenly of a heart attack at the age of 52, while on holiday in Thailand. After his death, many tributes and memorials were made to Warne, both in his home city of Melbourne and elsewhere in the cricketing world.

Others such as France already had their own burgeoning fascist movements and\/or anti-semitic sentiment, and the invaders validated and empowered this. Individuals such as Hendrik Seyffardt in the Netherlands and Theodoros Pangalos in Greece saw collaboration as a path to personal power in the politics of their country. Others believed that Germany would prevail, and either wanted to be on the winning side, or feared being on the losing one.\nAxis military forces recruited many volunteers, sometimes at gunpoint, more often with promises that they later broke, or from among POWs trying to escape appalling and frequently lethal conditions in their detention camps.

Lancashire Constabulary said that there was no evidence of either suspicious activity or third-party involvement in the disappearance and quickly stated that their working hypothesis was that she had fallen into the River Wyre. However, an extensive search of the river and surrounding land involving police divers, helicopters, sniffer dogs and drones found no body. \nOn 19 February Bulley's body was found in the river, by a man and a woman walking in the area, about one mile (1.5 kilometres) downstream of St Michael's on Wyre. The inquest, which concluded in June 2023, determined that Bulley's death was due to accidental drowning.\nThe police were criticised for their handling of the case, including releasing private details of Bulley's health and poorly communicating with the media which resulted in public speculation. Members of the public, particularly users of social media, were also criticised for travelling to the area during the search and for what the police described as \"[playing] private detectives\".","content":"#Background\n#Disappearance\n#Investigation\n##Police\n##Private search team\n#Recovery of body and inquest\n#Criticism of the media and of Lancashire Police\n#Independent review\n#Documentary\n#See also\n#Footnotes\n","lang":"en"}

It was the first edition of All In produced by AEW and second overall after the independently-held inaugural All In event in September 2018. The event took place on August 27, 2023, at Wembley Stadium in London, England, coinciding with the UK August Bank Holiday weekend. \nThe event marked AEW's debut in the UK, their first PPV event held outside of North America, and their first event held in an association football stadium. All In was the first professional wrestling event held at the current Wembley Stadium and first held at the venue in over 30 years, after WWE's SummerSlam in 1992, which was held at the original stadium. First day ticket sales alone broke AEW's live attendance record and ticket revenue and the promotion claimed a total attendance of 81,035: this would make All In the most attended wrestling event in the UK and the third-most attended wrestling event ever held. However, local government data logged a turnstile attendance of 72,265.\nEleven matches were contested at the event, including two on the Zero Hour pre-show. In the main event, MJF defeated Adam Cole to retain the AEW World Championship. In other prominent matches, Will Ospreay defeated Chris Jericho, Eddie Kingston, Penta El Zero Miedo, Best Friends (Chuck Taylor and Trent Beretta), and Orange Cassidy defeated Blackpool Combat Club (Jon Moxley, Claudio Castagnoli, and Wheeler Yuta), Mike Santana, and Ortiz in a Stadium Stampede match, and CM Punk defeated Samoa Joe to retain the \"Real World Championship\".

Such reports quickly spread throughout the United States; historians would later chronicle at least 800 \"copycat\" reports in subsequent weeks, while other sources estimate the reports may have numbered in the thousands.\nReports peaked on July 7.  After numerous hoaxes and mistaken identifications, the disc reports largely subsided by July 10.

In contrast, fringe speculation held that the discs might come from other planets or other dimensions; still others suggested the discs were occult or might signify the end of the world.\nThe 1947 craze has been extensively studied within the frameworks of both folklore studies and religious studies, where it is regarded by scholars as the \"birth of a modern myth\".","content":"#Overview\n#Events of Summer 1947\n##Initial reports\n###Additional reports\n###Pacific Northwest reports amid jet speculation\n###Reports throughout the West\n###Potential explanations offered\n##Increasing prominence\n###Lt.

{"title":"Racial_conceptions_of_Jewish_identity_in_Zionism","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Racial_conceptions_of_Jewish_identity_in_Zionism","summary":"In the late 19th century, amid attempts to apply science to notions of race, some advocates of Zionism sought to reformulate conceptions of Jewishness in terms of racial identity and the \"race science\" of the time. They believed that this concept would allow them to build a new framework for collective Jewish identity, and thought that biology might provide \"proof\" for the \"ethnonational myth of common descent\" from the biblical land of Israel. Countering antisemitic claims that Jews were both aliens and a racially inferior people who needed to be segregated or expelled, these Zionists drew on and appropriated elements from various race theories, to argue that only a Jewish national home could enable the physical regeneration of the Jewish people and a renaissance of pride in their ancient cultural traditions.\nThe contrasting assimilationist viewpoint was that Jewishness consisted in an attachment to Judaism as a religion and culture. Both the orthodox and liberal establishments, for different reasons, often rejected this idea. Subsequently, Zionist and non-Zionist Jews vigorously debated aspects of this proposition in terms of the merits or otherwise of diaspora life. While Zionism embarked on its project of social engineering in Mandatory Palestine, ethnonationalist politics on the European continent strengthened and, by the 1930s, some German Jews, acting defensively, asserted Jewish collective rights by redefining Jews as a race after Nazism rose to power. The advent of World War II led to the implementation of the Holocaust's policies of genocidal ethnic cleansing, which, by war's end, had utterly discredited race as the lethal product of pseudoscience.\nWith the establishment of Israel in 1948, the \"ingathering of the exiles\", and the Law of Return, the question of Jewish origins and biological unity came to assume particular importance during early nation building. Conscious of this, Israeli medical researchers and geneticists were careful to avoid any language that might resonate with racial ideas. Themes of \"blood logic\" or \"race\" have nevertheless been described as a recurrent feature of modern Jewish thought in both scholarship and popular belief. Despite this, many aspects of the role of race in the formation of Zionist concepts of a Jewish identity were rarely addressed until recently.\nQuestions of how political narratives impact the work of population genetics, and its connection to race, have a particular significance in Jewish history and culture. Genetic studies on the origins of modern Jews have been criticized as \"being designed or interpreted in the framework of a 'Zionist narrative'\" and as an essentialist approach to biology in a similar manner to criticism of the interpretation of archaeological science in the region. According to Israeli historian of science Nurit Kirsh and Israeli geneticist Raphael Falk, the interpretation of the genetic data has been unconsciously influenced by Zionism and anti-Zionism. Falk wrote that every generation has witnessed efforts by both Zionist and non-Zionist Jews to seek a link between national and biological aspects of Jewish identity.","content":"#Literature review\n#History\n##Background\n##Early Zionism\n##1948–1960s\n##1960s–2000\n##The genome era: 2000 to the present\n##Race and non-Jews\n#Impact\n#See also\n#Notes\n##Citations\n","lang":"en"}

Among the victims were Yevgeny Prigozhin, Dmitry Utkin and Valery Chekalov, the key figures of the Wagner Group, a Russian state-funded private military company. The crash prompted speculation that the jet was destroyed on the orders of Russian president Vladimir Putin, after Prigozhin had led the Wagner Group rebellion exactly two months prior.\nTracking data from Flightradar24 showed unusual altitude variations followed by a \"dramatic descent\" shortly before the plane crashed. Visual evidence suggested structural failure of the aircraft. Western intelligence reported that an explosion likely caused the airplane to crash.\nThe aircraft, manufactured by Brazilian company Embraer, had been associated with Prigozhin since 2018. It was barred from the United States due to sanctions imposed on Prigozhin after his involvement in the Russian interference in the 2018 United States elections.\nWhile official Russian sources downplayed the crash, some intelligence agencies and international leaders suggested it was a politically motivated assassination. Prigozhin's previous criticism of the Russian Defense Ministry and open rebellion against Russian government were cited as potential motivations for foul play. The deaths of Prigozhin, Utkin, and Chekalov are among several sudden deaths of Russian officials since 2022 considered suspicious.","content":"#Background\n##Aircraft\n#Incident\n#Passengers and crew\n#Investigation\n##Assessments outside Russia\n#Effect on the Wagner Group\n#Aftermath\n#Reactions\n##Domestic\n##International\n#Memorials\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

After having lost his working majority to defections and his own suspensions of rebel Members of Parliament, Johnson called a general election on a platform of completing the UK's withdrawal from the European Union. In that general election, the Conservative Party won their biggest majority in Parliament since 1987, and Johnson was able to pass a revised version of May's withdrawal agreement.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK, Johnson and his government had instituted public health restrictions, including limitations on social interaction, that Johnson and some of his staff were later found to have broken. The resulting political scandal (Partygate), one of many in a string of controversies that characterised Johnson's premiership, severely damaged his personal reputation. Johnson won a confidence vote by Conservative MPs in June 2022. The situation escalated with the Chris Pincher scandal in July 2022, and between 5 and 7 July, more than 60 government ministers, parliamentary private secretaries, trade envoys, and party vice-chairmen resigned in what was the largest mass resignation in British history. Many previously supportive MPs called for Johnson to resign. This brought about a government crisis, culminating on 7 July, when Johnson announced that he would resign as party leader. Johnson also announced that he would remain as prime minister until a successor was elected.\nVoting took place between 13 July and 2 September. After a series of MP ballots, the list of candidates was narrowed down to Liz Truss, who served as Foreign Secretary and Minister for Women and Equalities under Johnson's leadership, and Rishi Sunak, who served as Chancellor of the Exchequer until 5 July. On 5 September, Truss was elected to lead the party, and assumed the premiership on 6 September. In her victory speech, Truss thanked Johnson and stated that her new government would cut taxes and deal with the energy crisis. Truss would later resign after just 50 days in office amid an economic and political crisis, which made her the shortest-serving prime minister in British history. Truss would be succeeded by Sunak, after he won the leadership contest to replace her.","content":"#Background\n##Brexit and the 2019 leadership election\n##2019 general election\n##COVID-19 pandemic and Partygate\n##June 2022 confidence vote\n##Government crisis\n#Election details\n#Campaign\n#Candidates\n##Nominated\n##Withdrew\n##Publicly expressed interest\n##Declined\n#Endorsements\n#Timeline\n#Debates\n##Public reaction\n#Public hustings\n#Opinion polling\n##Sunak vs. Truss\n##Sunak vs. Truss vs. Johnson\n##Party members\n##Public\n#Results\n#See also\n#Notes\n","lang":"en"}
{"title":"Reformation","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Reformation","summary":"The Reformation, also known as the Protestant Reformation and the European Reformation, was a major theological movement or period or series of events in Western Christianity in 16th-century Northwestern Europe that posed a religious and political challenge to the papacy and the authority of the Catholic Church. Towards the end of the Renaissance, the Reformation marked the beginning of Protestantism and in turn resulted in a major schism within Western Christianity.\nIt is considered one of the events that signified the end of the Middle Ages and the beginning of the early modern period in Europe. When the Reformation era ended is disputed among modern scholars.\nPrior to Martin Luther and other Protestant Reformers, there were earlier reform movements within Western Christianity. The Protestant Reformation, however, is usually considered to have started on 31 October 1517 with the publication of the Ninety-five Theses, authored by Martin Luther. Over three years later, on 3 January 1521, Luther was excommunicated by Pope Leo X. On 25 May 1521, at the Diet of Worms, Luther was condemned by the Holy Roman Empire, which officially banned citizens from defending or propagating Luther's ideas.  Luther survived after being declared an outlaw due to the protection of Elector Frederick the Wise.\nThe spread of Gutenberg's printing press provided the means for the rapid dissemination of religious materials in the vernacular. The initial movement in Germany diversified, and nearby other reformers such as Huldrych Zwingli and John Calvin with different theologies arose.\nIn general, the Reformers argued that salvation in Christianity was a completed status based on faith in Jesus alone and not a process that could involve good works, as in the Catholic view. Protestantism also introduced new ecclesiology.\nThe Counter-Reformation was the Catholic reform efforts initiated in response to the Protestant Reformation and its causes.","content":"#Terminology\n#Background\n##Calamities\n##Late Medieval Christianity\n###Institutions\n###Clergy\n###Papacy\n###Partial and failed institutional reforms\n##Humanism and lay religion\n##Dissidents\n#Beginnings\n##Luther and the Ninety-five Theses\n##New theology\n##Spread\n##Resistance and oppression\n#Alternatives\n##Saxon radicals and rebellious knights\n##Zwingli\n##Swiss Brethren\n##Peasants' War\n#Consolidation\n##Princely Reformation in Germany\n##Stalemate in Switzerland\n##Schleitheim Articles\n##Confessions\n##Royal Reformation in Scandinavia\n#Catholic reform\n##Beginnings\n##New Orders\n##Council of Trent\n#New waves\n##English reformation under Henry VIII\n##Münster\n##Calvin and the Institutes of the Christian Religion\n##Reformation in Britain\n##Servetus and the Restoration of Christianity\n#Wars of religion and tolerance\n##Schmalkaldic Wars\n##French Wars of Religion\n##Revolt in the Netherlands\n##Edict of Torda\n##Warsaw Confederation\n##Counter-Reformation and regional conflicts\n#Reformation outside Germany\n##Nordic countries\n###Iceland\n##Great Britain\n###England\n####English North America\n###Wales\n###Scotland\n##France\n##Spain\n##Italy\n##Slovenia\n##Greece\n#Spread\n#Conclusion and legacy\n##Thirty Years' War: 1618–1648\n##Consequences of the Reformation\n##Radical Reformation\n##Literacy\n##Outcomes\n###Human capital formation\n###Protestant ethic\n###Economic development\n###Governance\n###Other outcomes\n##Historiography\n##Music and art\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#Further reading\n##Surveys\n##Theology\n##Primary sources in translation\n##Historiography\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

He played the banjo wearing a tuxedo, bringing an air of sophistication to the instrument, when the 19th-century image for a banjo player tended toward the comic, the racist and the crude. He had a reputation for entertaining \"cultivated audiences\" with banjo adaptations of European classical music. Farland's adaptations included Bach violin sonatas, Beethoven violin sonatas, a Mendelsson violin sonata, Brahms dances, and some of Chopin's nocturnes and waltzes. His performances of this kind of music on the banjo were seen in 1900 as successfully \"stretching the limits of the instrument.\"\nFarland based his performances initially out of Pittsburg, but later moved to New York, in order to be closer to potential students during his off season. He wrote a banjo method and composed music for students to practice.\nFarland was also an inventor and designed his own line of banjos with wooden rims.  He held patents for banjo-related inventions, including an all-metal banjo head and an adapter to produce harp-like tones from a banjo.","content":"#Background\n#Professional life\n#Classical-music artist\n#Marketing with his name\n#American Banjo Fraternity\n#Works\n##Educational\n##Sheet music\n#Gallery\n#Examples in S.S.

{"title":"Samnites","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Samnites","summary":"The Samnites (Oscan: Safineis) were an ancient Italic people who lived in Samnium, which is located in modern inland Abruzzo, Molise, and Campania in south-central Italy.\n\nAn Oscan-speaking people, who originated as an offshoot of the Sabines, they formed a confederation consisting of four tribes: the Hirpini, Caudini, Caraceni, and Pentri. Ancient Greek historians considered the Umbri as the ancestors of the Samnites. Their migration was in a southward direction, according to the rite of ver sacrum.\nAlthough allied together against the Gauls in 354 BC, they later became enemies of the Romans and fought them in a series of three wars. Despite an overwhelming victory at the Battle of the Caudine Forks (321 BC), the Samnites were subjugated in 290 BC. Although severely weakened, the Samnites would still side against the Romans, first in the Pyrrhic War and then with Hannibal in the Second Punic War. They also fought in the Social War and later in Sulla's civil war as allies of the Roman consuls Papirius Carbo and Gaius Marius against Sulla, who defeated them and their leader Pontius Telesinus at the Battle of the Colline Gate (82 BC). Afterward, they were assimilated by the Romans and ceased to exist as a distinct people.\nThe Samnites had an economy focused upon livestock and agriculture. Samnite agriculture was highly advanced for its time, and they practiced transhumance. Aside from relying on agriculture, the Samnites exported goods such as ceramics, bronze, iron, olives, wool, pottery, and terracottas. Their trade networks extended across Campania, Latium, Apulia, and Magna Graecia.\nSamnite society was stratified into cantons. Each city was a vicus. Many vici were grouped into a pagus, and many pagi were grouped into a touto. There were four Samnite touto, one for each of the Samnite tribes. Aside from this system of government, a few Samnite cities had political entities similar to a senate. It was rare, although possible, for the Samnites to unify under a coalition; normally the tribes and cities functioned independently from one another.\nSamnite religion worshipped both spirits called numina and gods and goddesses. The Samnites honored their gods by sacrificing live animals and using votive offerings. Superstition was prominent in the Samnite religion. It was believed that magical chants could influence reality, that magical amulets could protect people, and that augurs could see the future. Samnite priests would manage religious festivals and they could bind people to oaths. Sanctuaries were a major part of the Samnite religion. These might have been used to benefit from trade networks, may have marked the border between territories, and may have been intertwined with government. Samnite sanctuaries may have also been used to reinforce group identity.","content":"#Etymology\n#History\n##Origins and early history\n##Samnite Wars\n##Later history\n#Society\n##Economy\n##Government\n##Military\n###Armor\n###Weaponry\n#Culture\n##Religion\n##Gender roles\n##Art\n##Clothing\n##Recreation\n##Cities and engineering\n#Notable Samnites\n##Leaders of the Samnites\n##Social War leaders\n##Romans of Samnite origin\n##Catholic Popes\n#See also\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

The order, unsealed a few days after the search, showed that the FBI obtained the search warrant as part of an investigation into Trump relating to three federal criminal statutes:\n\nviolations of the Espionage Act regarding unauthorized retention of national defense information;\ndestroying or concealing records \"with the intent to impede obstruct or influence\" federal government activity;\nillegal removal or destruction of federal government records (without respect to cause).\nLater, courts released the affidavit with redactions, giving the public a window into the FBI's goals in this search and what the FBI seized. In 2021, NARA tried to recover material, and Trump went through the material in his possession at the end of that year. Surveillance footage subpoenaed by the Justice Department in June 2022 showed boxes were moved in and out of a storage room at some point. The Justice Department said the classified documents at Mar-a-Lago were likely \"concealed and removed\" to block investigation.\nOver 13,000 government documents were recovered. They included nuclear-related information and FBI, CIA, and NSA information about national security interests. Of these documents, 337 were classified: 197 handed over in January 2022, 38 turned over under subpoena in June 2022, and 102 seized in the August search of Mar-a-Lago. Months later, at least two more documents with classified markings were uncovered at Trump locations.\nOn June 8, 2023, Trump was indicted on federal charges related to the documents. On June 13, 2023, Trump surrendered to federal custody and was arrested, booked, processed, and arraigned in the U.S. District Court of South Florida. Trump pleaded not guilty to all 37 charges.

{"title":"Fort_Amsterdam","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fort_Amsterdam","summary":"Fort Amsterdam was a fortification on the southern tip of Manhattan Island at the confluence of the Hudson and East rivers. The fort and the island were the center of trade and the administrative headquarters for the Dutch and then British\/Colonial rule of the colony of New Netherland and thereafter the Province of New York. The fort was the nucleus of the settlement on the island and greater area, which was named New Amsterdam by the first Dutch settlers and eventually renamed New York by the English, and was central to much of New York's early history.\nBefore the fort was constructed, it was the scene where the purchase of Manhattan Island occurred. In its subsequent history, the fort was known under various names such as Fort James, Fort Willem Hendrick and its anglicized Fort William Henry, Fort Anne, and Fort George. The fort changed hands eight times in various battles, the first episode involving Dutch governor Peter Stuyvesant, who surrendered the fort to Richard Nicolls of England in 1664. In the 18th century, the fort was at the center of the Stamp Act riots in New York when it was used to store shipments of stamped paper brought over from England, while serving as a safe haven for a number of stamp tax collectors. During the American Revolution, it was involved in the Battle of Brooklyn, when volleys were exchanged between the fort and British emplacements on Governor's Island. After 165 years of service, involving a number of conflicts, the fort was finally torn down in 1790 after the American Revolution. After the fort's demolition, the Government House was constructed on the site as a possible house for the United States President. The site is now occupied by the Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House, which houses a branch of the National Museum of the American Indian; Bowling Green is nearby.\nThe construction of the fort marked the official founding date of New York City as recognized by its seal. In October 1683, what would become the first session of the New York legislature convened at the fort. Artillery guns outside the fort overlooking the harbor formed a battery that would later be the namesake of nearby Battery Park.","content":"#History\n##Establishment (1621–1660)\n##English rule (1664–1673)\n##Dutch rule (1673–1674)\n##English rule (1674–1689)\n##Colonist rule (1689–1691)\n##British rule (1691–1775)\n##Prelude to the revolution\n##Colonist rule (1775–1776)\n##British rule (1776–1783)\n##American rule (1783–1790)\n#See also\n#Notes\n#Citations\n#Bibliography\n##Further reading\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

The results saw the right-wing national camp of former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu win a parliamentary majority, amid losses for left-wing and Arab parties, as well as gains by the far-right.\nAfter the 2021 elections, the next elections had been scheduled for no later than 11 November 2025 according to the four-year term limit set by Basic Law: The Government. The thirty-sixth government, a national unity government formed between eight political parties following the 2021 elections, held the narrowest possible majority (61 seats) in the 120-member Knesset. In April 2022, MK Idit Silman left the governing coalition, leaving it without a majority.\nOn 20 June 2022, following several legislative defeats for the government in the Knesset, prime minister Naftali Bennett and alternate prime minister Yair Lapid announced the introduction of a bill to dissolve the 24th Knesset, which was approved on 30 June.  Simultaneously, in accordance with the rotation government agreement that was part of the 2021 coalition deal, Lapid became prime minister and led a caretaker government until a new government took office.\nWithin the context of the 2018–2022 Israeli political crisis, this was the fifth Knesset election in nearly four years, as no party had been able to form a stable coalition since 2019. A total of 40 parties registered to run for these elections, although only twelve to fourteen parties were projected to cross the 3.25% electoral threshold to win seats under the closed list, proportional representation electoral system. Ten parties succeeded in crossing the threshold. On 21 December, Netanyahu announced that he had succeeded in forming a coalition government consisting of 64 MKs.

{"title":"Beergate","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Beergate","summary":"Beergate was a British political controversy concerning allegations that an event in Durham on 30 April 2021, attended by Labour Party leader Keir Starmer and Deputy Leader Angela Rayner, could have been in breach of COVID-19 lockdown restrictions. Labour and Starmer said, at the time and since, that the event complied with the rules for work gatherings, with a pause for food. The police, after investigating, cleared the Labour attendees, including Starmer and Rayner.\nAt the Durham event, shortly before the Hartlepool by-election and local elections, a Labour Party campaign team of seventeen people, including Starmer and deputy leader Angela Rayner, used the office of MP Mary Foy. Around 10 pm, a student Ivo Delingpole, took a short video through the office window of the event. Next day, The Sun published a brief story including Labour's statement that this was a permissible work event, and pictures from the video showing Starmer with a beer while others ate a takeaway. The story then got little attention.\nWhile responding to Partygate allegations in December 2021, Prime Minister Boris Johnson referred to the Durham event. In January 2022, he apologised for attending a \"socially distanced drinks\" gathering, saying he had believed it was a work event. Starmer said Johnson had breached the Ministerial Code by misleading Parliament, and asked him to resign. Conservatives featured in The Daily Telegraph and the Daily Mail called Starmer a hypocrite, alleging that he had similarly breached lockdown rules. On 7 February 2022, Durham Constabulary cleared Starmer over the allegation. They had reviewed the video and did not believe an offence had been established, so would take no further action.\nOn 12 April 2022, after Johnson was given a fixed penalty notice (FPN) for breaching COVID-19 regulations, Starmer again said Johnson should resign. Press and Conservatives made allegations about the Durham event and demanded a detailed investigation, on 6 May Durham Constabulary said they had begun investigating as new evidence had emerged. On 9 May, Starmer and Rayner said they were confident they had not broken any rules, but would resign if issued with FPNs, to demonstrate what they said were different principles to Johnson who remained in office. On 8 July 2022, Durham Constabulary announced that all attendees, including Rayner and Starmer, had been cleared of any wrongdoing. By then, the government was in crisis, and on 7 July Johnson had announced his resignation.","content":"#Durham event\n##Video footage\n#Response to Partygate\n#Initial police review\n##Calls for further investigation\n#Police investigation\n##Start of investigation\n##New allegations\n##Starmer's and Rayner's resignation pledges\n##Responses to pledges\n##Police questionnaires\n##Outcome\n##Responses to the outcome\n#Related developments\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n","lang":"en"}

Reviews noted both humorous and emotionally fraught lyrics, detailing Rodrigo's struggles with identity, romantic and professional disillusionment, unexpected stardom, and societal expectations as a young woman.\nGuts topped album charts in 15 countries, including the United States, Australia, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. In its US debut, it recorded 302,000 first-week album-equivalent units while charting all 12 of its songs in the top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100. Three singles were released from the album, including the international number-one track \"Vampire\", and the top-10 charting \"Bad Idea Right?\" and \"Get Him Back!\". The album's deluxe edition, subtitled Spilled, was released on March 22, 2024, along with its lead single \"Obsessed\". At the 66th Annual Grammy Awards, the album received nominations for Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album, becoming her second consecutive Album of the Year nomination. Two of the album's tracks—\"Vampire\" and \"Ballad of a Homeschooled Girl\"—received four further Grammy nominations. In support of the album, Rodrigo embarked on the Guts World Tour in 2024.","content":"#Background\n#Writing and recording\n#Music\n##Lyrics\n#Release and promotion\n##Cover artwork\n##Singles\n##Marketing\n##Tour\n##Guts: The Secret Tracks\n#Critical reception\n##Year-end lists\n#Commercial performance\n#Accolades\n#Track listing\n#Personnel\n#Charts\n#Certifications\n#Release history\n#See also\n#References\n#Further reading\n","lang":"en"}

Catastrophic natural disasters included the fifth-deadliest earthquake of the 21st century striking Turkey and Syria, leaving up to 62,000 people dead, Cyclone Freddy – the longest-lasting recorded tropical cyclone in history in the Indian Ocean – leading to over 1,400 deaths in Malawi and Mozambique, Storm Daniel, which became the deadliest cyclone worldwide since Cyclone Nargis after killing at least 11,000 people in Libya, a major 6.8 magnitude earthquake striking western Morocco, killing 2,960 people, and a 6.3 magnitude quadruple earthquake striking western Afghanistan, killing over 1,400 people.\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine and Myanmar civil war continued in 2023, and a series of coups, several armed conflicts, and political crises broke out in numerous African nations, most notably a war in Sudan. The Nagorno-Karabakh conflict ended after over 100,000 Armenians fled the region after an Azeri military invasion. A major escalation of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict occurred in October when Hamas, which governs the Gaza Strip, led a major attack on Israel, leading the latter to both declare war on Hamas and invade the Gaza Strip. The Israeli aerial bombardment campaign killed 20,000 Palestinians within two months and caused a humanitarian crisis, leading to allegations of genocide that formed the basis of an ICJ case brought by South Africa that December.\nA banking crisis resulted in the collapse of numerous American regional banks as well as the buyout of Credit Suisse by UBS in Switzerland. The two largest American banks to collapse were Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic Bank, two of the three largest banking collapses in US history. The most notable of numerous acquisitions in various industries included October's energy acquisitions with ExxonMobil and Chevron buying Pioneer Natural Resources and Hess respectively, the luxury fashion holding company Tapestry (Coach New York and Kate Spade New York) announcing its purchase of Capri Holdings (Michael Kors and Versace), and the closure of Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard.\nIn the realm of technology, 2023 saw the continued rise of generative AI models, with increasing applications across various industries. These models, leveraging advancements in machine learning and natural language processing, had become capable of creating realistic and coherent text, images, and music. An AI arms race between private companies has continued since the late 2010s, with Microsoft-backed OpenAI and Google owner Alphabet today most dominant among firms.","content":"#Events\n##January\n##February\n##March\n##April\n##May\n##June\n##July\n##August\n##September\n##October\n##November\n##December\n#Demographics\n#Best-selling media\n#Deaths\n#Nobel Prizes\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Good_News_International_Ministries","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Good_News_International_Ministries","summary":"The Good News International Ministries (GNIM), also known as the Good News International Church and the Servant P. N. Mackenzie Ministries, and commonly referred to as the Shakahola cult, is an apocalyptic Christian new religious movement which was founded by Paul Nthenge Mackenzie and his first wife in 2003. Following the deaths of over 400 of its members and their children at the movement's base in Shakahola, Kilifi County, Kenya, the group has been designated by the Kenyan government as an organized criminal group. As of August 2024, Mackenzie was on trial, accused of manslaughter, torture and terrorism.\nGNIM attracted international attention in April 2023 when it was revealed that Mackenzie had allegedly instructed members to starve themselves en masse to \"meet Jesus,\" resulting in the deaths of over 400 people. The group, widely described as a cult or doomsday cult, is adamantly anti-Western, with amenities such as health care, education, and sports being dismissed as \"evils of western life\" and with Mackenzie condemning the United States, United Nations, and the Catholic Church as \"tools of Satan\". The group devotes much of its teachings to the end times. They were purportedly influenced by the End-Time Message of William Branham. Homicide detectives working on the case alleged the group was radicalized by Branham's teachings, leading to their deaths. \nMackenzie founded the GNIM in 2003 and accumulated a sizable following, largely due to convincing his followers that he could speak directly with God. Beginning in the late 2010s, Mackenzie's church began to receive a renewed wave of scrutiny regarding the internal practices of the organization. In 2017, Mackenzie and his wife faced several charges relating to the church. He was chastised for inciting students to abandon their education after denouncing it as \"ungodly\", as well as radicalizing and denying medical care to the children afterwards; several children died as a result and, in 2017, 93 children were rescued by government authorities from the group. After another arrest in 2019, he departed Malindi and headed to the Shakahola forest, where the mass starvation occurred in 2023.\nMackenzie did not join his followers in the mass starvation; a dietary menu was found on the wall in one of the special houses in the forest believed to be his resting room. He was taken into police custody as the process of exhuming the bodies continued, and on January 18, 2024, he was charged with 191 counts of murder. Police authorities claimed that some bodies were missing organs, and believed they were being harvested and sold. However, this claim was refuted by Interior Cabinet Secretary Kithure Kindiki on 10 May. As of 8 May, autopsies performed on 112 of the exhumed bodies ruled out the possibility of organ harvesting. The church was on 31st January 2024 declared by the Kenya government as an “organized criminal group” under the Prevention of Organized Crimes Act.","content":"#History\n#Teachings\n#Mass starvation\n##Criminal proceedings\n##Reactions\n#Second suspected Malindi cult\n#Church deregistration\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. The event took place on Saturday, May 6, 2023, at the Coliseo de Puerto Rico José Miguel Agrelot in San Juan, Puerto Rico. This was the first WWE pay-per-view event held in Puerto Rico since New Year's Revolution in January 2005, and the second Backlash event held outside the continental United States following the 2004 event. After the previous two years were titled \"WrestleMania Backlash\", the 2023 event reverted to its original name while still maintaining its post-WrestleMania concept, with the 2023 event based around the backlash from WrestleMania 39.\nPuerto Rico native and Grammy Award winning rapper Bad Bunny was featured at the event. He was originally promoted to be the host of Backlash, but it was later announced that Bad Bunny would compete in a San Juan Street Fight against Damian Priest, also of Puerto Rican descent, a match that Bad Bunny won.

{"title":"Cyclone_Freddy","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cyclone_Freddy","summary":"Very Intense Tropical Cyclone Freddy, also known as Severe Tropical Cyclone Freddy, was an exceptionally long-lived, powerful, and deadly tropical cyclone that traversed the southern Indian Ocean for more than five weeks in February and March 2023. Freddy was the longest-lasting tropical cyclone ever recorded worldwide, and produced the most accumulated cyclone energy—a metric used to measure the total energy generated by tropical cyclones—of any individual cyclone on record globally. Additionally, it is the third-deadliest tropical cyclone recorded in the Southern Hemisphere, only behind 2019's Cyclone Idai and the 1973 Flores cyclone. \nFreddy originated from a tropical low that was located south of the Indonesian archipelago on 4 February 2023.  As it traveled westward across the Indian Ocean, the storm quickly intensified, becoming a Category 4 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian scale. Freddy moved into the South-West Indian Ocean, where it reached its peak intensity with 10-minute sustained winds of 230 km\/h (145 mph)  and a central atmospheric pressure of 927 hPa (27.37 inHg), making it a very intense tropical cyclone. Meanwhile, 1-minute sustained winds reached  270 km\/h (165 mph), corresponding to Category 5-equivalent intensity on the Saffir–Simpson scale. After reaching its peak intensity, the cyclone moved toward the northern Mascarene Islands and made landfall near Mananjary, Madagascar on 21 February. It weakened further across Madagascar but regained strength upon reaching the Mozambique Channel, where it intensified and made its second landfall near Vilankulos, Mozambique on 24 February. After moving across Mozambique, the cyclone endured and re-entered the channel on 1 March. It then regained its tropical characteristics and started moving along the coast of Madagascar. Freddy intensified again before making its final landfall near Quelimane, Mozambique on 11 March. It then rapidly weakened as it moved inland and dissipated by 14 March.\nPreparations for the storm in the Mascarene Islands included flight groundings, cyclone alerts, and personnel being prepped for the aftermath, among other things. In Madagascar, areas previously affected by Cyclones Batsirai and Cheneso were feared to be worsened by the storm's arrival. Impacts in Mozambique were more severe than in Madagascar and included heavy rainfall in the southern half of the country and widely damaged infrastructure. Effects in Mozambique were exacerbated after its second landfall with further floods and wind damage. The hardest-hit was Malawi where incessant rains caused catastrophic flash floods, especially Blantyre. The nation's power grid was crippled, with its hydroelectric dam rendered inoperable. Overall, the cyclone resulted in at least 1,434 fatalities, 2,004 injuries, 19 people missing, and caused approximately US$481 million in damage. Consequently, due to the extensive damage and loss of life, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology has retired the name Freddy from the Australian rotating naming lists, and a replacement name has yet to be announced.","content":"#Meteorological history\n##Records\n#Preparations\n##Mauritius\n##Réunion\n##Madagascar\n##Mozambique\n##Malawi\n#Impact\n##Mascarene Islands\n##Madagascar\n##Mozambique\n##Malawi\n##Elsewhere in mainland Africa\n#Aftermath\n##Madagascar\n##Mozambique\n##Malawi\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Croatia_national_football_team","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Croatia_national_football_team","summary":"The Croatia national football team (Croatian: Hrvatska nogometna reprezentacija) represents Croatia in international football matches. It is governed by the Croatian Football Federation (HNS), the governing body for football in Croatia. It is a member of UEFA in Europe and FIFA in global competitions. The team's colours reference two national symbols: the Croatian checkerboard and the country's tricolour. They are colloquially referred to as the Vatreni (Blazers) and Kockasti (Checkered Ones).\nSince 1994, the Vatreni have qualified for every major tournament with the exception of UEFA Euro 2000 and the 2010 FIFA World Cup. At the World Cup, Croatia has finished second once (2018) and third on two occasions (1998, 2022), securing three World Cup medals. Davor Šuker won the Golden Shoe and the Silver Ball in 1998, while Luka Modrić won the Golden Ball in 2018 and the Bronze Ball in 2022. The team has reached the quarter-finals of the UEFA European Championship twice (1996, 2008). They finished second in the UEFA Nations League in 2023.\nUpon its admission into FIFA in 1994 ranked 125th, they ascended to third place with their debut 1998 World Cup campaign. This marked the fastest, most volatile ascension in FIFA ranking history, making them the youngest team to ever reach a Top 10 place in the World Ranking. Croatia is the second-smallest country by population (after Uruguay) and land mass (after the Netherlands) to reach a World Cup final. At the World Cup, Croatia hold records for most penalty shoot-out played (4) and won (4) and most penalties saved in a shoot-out (3), among other team records. They were named FIFA Best Mover of the Year in 1994 and 1998, thus becoming the first national team to win the award twice and also equalling joint records with France and Colombia.","content":"#History\n##Official formation\n##Blažević period (1994–1999)\n##Jozić, Barić and Kranjčar period (2000–2006)\n##Bilić period (2006–2012)\n##Štimac, Kovač and Čačić period (2012–2017)\n##Dalić period (since 2017)\n#Image\n##Kits\n##Supporters\n##Charity\n#Stadiums\n#Results and fixtures\n##2023\n##2024\n#Management\n##Manager history\n#Players\n##Current squad\n##Recent call-ups\n#Individual statistics\n##Most appearances\n##Top goalscorers\n##Most clean sheets\n#Competitive record\n##FIFA World Cup\n##UEFA European Championship\n##UEFA Nations League\n##Other\n#Head-to-head record\n#FIFA ranking history\n#Honours\n##Major competitions\n##Friendly\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

Upon entering adolescence, Joe Martin began to physically attack humans and other animals, including studio staff, director Al Santell, his trainers, and actors including Dorothy Phillips and Edward Connelly. At least three of these cases were apparent defenses of a woman, child, or animal. He staged major zoo escapes at least twice, once releasing the wolves and the elephant on the way out, and, separately, while evading recapture, relieving a police officer of his gun.\nIn 1924, Universal Pictures deemed Joe Martin too dangerous to work in film and sold him to the Al G. Barnes Circus, where he remained until approximately 1931.

{"title":"2023_Ukrainian_counteroffensive","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2023_Ukrainian_counteroffensive","summary":"In early June 2023, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Ukraine launched a counteroffensive against Russian forces occupying its territory with a goal of breaching the front lines. Efforts were made in many directions, primarily in Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia oblasts. In total, Ukraine recaptured 14 villages in Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia oblasts, with a total pre-war population of around 5,000. The counteroffensive was widely regarded as a crucial moment in the war.\nPlanning for a major Ukrainian counteroffensive had begun as early as February 2023, with the original intention being to launch it in the spring. However, various factors, including weather and late weapon deliveries to Ukraine, delayed it to summer, as it had not been deemed safe to progress. Russia had begun preparing for the counteroffensive since November 2022 and had created extensive defensive infrastructure, including ditches, trenches, artillery positions, and landmines intended to slow the counteroffensive. Ukraine met well-established Russian defenses in the early days of the counteroffensive and after that slowed their pacing in order to assess the extent of Russian defenses, demine territory, save troops, and exhaust Russia's military resources. They made incremental gains by capturing over 370 km2 of territory, less than half of what Russia captured in all of 2023.\nAlmost five months after its start, prominent Ukrainian figures and Western analysts began giving negative assessments of the counteroffensive; statements by Ukrainian general Valerii Zaluzhnyi in early November 2023 that the war was a \"stalemate\" were seen by observers as an admission of failure. Rigorous assessments made by analysts followed, especially with regard to operational success, from several weeks earlier. That same month, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated the war would be entering a new phase. Ukrainian forces did not reach the city of Tokmak, described as a \"minimum goal\" by Ukrainian general Oleksandr Tarnavskyi, and the probable initial objective of reaching the Sea of Azov to split the Russian forces in southern Ukraine remained unfulfilled. By early December 2023, the counteroffensive was generally considered to be stalled or failed by multiple international media outlets.","content":"#Background\n##State of the war\n##Russian defenses\n#Prelude\n##Planning\n##Shaping operations\n#Counteroffensive\n##Start date\n##Southern front\n###Melitopol direction\n###Berdiansk direction: Staromaiorske-Urozhaine\n##Eastern front\n###Donetsk Oblast\n##Dnieper front\n##Behind front lines\n###Crimea and the Black Sea\n###Other areas\n##Result\n#Strengths\n##Personnel\n##Equipment\n#Casualties and losses\n##Ukraine\n##Russia\n#Analysis\n##Timeframe and progression\n##Significance and goals\n###Concerns\n##Tactics and equipment\n###Russian minefields and fortifications\n###Artillery and aerial warfare\n###Other tactics and equipment\n##Russian command\n###Structure\n###Issues\n#Early reactions\n##Governmental\n##Russian information space and milbloggers\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Bibliography\n","lang":"en"}
{"title":"Typhoon_Hinnamnor","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Typhoon_Hinnamnor","summary":"Typhoon Hinnamnor, known in the Philippines as Super Typhoon Henry, was a very large and powerful tropical cyclone that impacted Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines, and Russia. The eleventh named storm, fourth typhoon, and the 1st super typhoon of the 2022 Pacific typhoon season, Hinnamnor originated from a disturbed area of weather first noted on August 27 by the JTWC. This area soon formed into Tropical Storm Hinnamnor on the next day. The storm rapidly intensified and became a typhoon on the August 29. Overnight, Hinnamnor cleared a small eye along with a well-defined CDO, and intensified into a high-end Category 4-equivalent super typhoon.\nHinnamnor then weakened due to undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle. However, it re-intensified to a Category 5 super typhoon, the first of 2022, with a larger eye and CDO south of Okinawa. An increasingly hostile environment caused it to lose its convective features the night of September 1, weakening it down to a Category 1-equivalent typhoon. As the storm accelerated northward into the East China Sea, it rebuilt itself throughout the next day, and began intensifying again. The storm gained major status once again on September 4, and headed northeastwards towards Busan. Beginning to weaken for the final time on September 5, the storm made landfall late that day as a Category 2-equivalent typhoon and began extratropical transition.\nAs Hinnamnor approached, many advisories concerning the storm were issued in Japan, China, Taiwan, and South Korea. The typhoon brought flooding rainfall and powerful winds to Okinawa, and thousands of homes suffered power outages. Heavy rainfall affected northern districts in Taiwan, and a man died in the Philippines due to Hinnamnor's flooding. Hinnamnor made landfall just southeast of Geoje in South Korea, knocking out power for tens of thousands of homes. Overall, the typhoon was responsible for 20 deaths, 1 missing and US$1.81 billion in damage across several countries.","content":"#Meteorological history\n#Preparations\n##Japan\n##South Korea\n##Elsewhere\n#Impact\n##Japan\n##South Korea\n##Elsewhere\n#Retirement\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"2022_United_States_elections","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2022_United_States_elections","summary":"The 2022 United States elections were held on November 8, 2022, with the exception of absentee balloting. During this U.S. midterm election, which occurred during the term of incumbent president Joe Biden of the Democratic Party, all 435 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and 35 of the 100 seats in the U.S. Senate were contested to determine the 118th United States Congress. Thirty-nine state and territorial U.S. gubernatorial elections, as well as numerous state and local elections, were also contested. This was the first election affected by the 2022 redistricting that followed the 2020 census. The Republican Party ended unified Democratic control of Congress and the presidency by winning a majority in the House of Representatives while Democrats expanded their Senate majority.\nMidterm elections typically see the incumbent president's party lose a substantial number of seats, but Democrats outperformed the historical trend and a widely anticipated red wave did not materialize. Republicans narrowly won the House due to their overperformance in the nation's four largest states: Texas, Florida, New York and California. Democrats increased their seats in the Senate by one, as they won races in critical battleground states, where voters rejected Donald Trump-aligned Republican candidates. This was the fifth election cycle in history in which the president's party gained Senate seats and simultaneously lost House seats in a midterm, along with 1914, 1962, 1970, and 2018.\nThe Democratic Party's strength in state-level and senatorial elections was unexpected, as well as historic. They won a net gain of two seats in the gubernatorial elections, flipping the governorships in Arizona, Maryland, and Massachusetts; conversely, Republicans flipped Nevada's governorship. In the state legislative elections, Democrats flipped both chambers of the Michigan Legislature, the Minnesota Senate, and the Pennsylvania House, and achieved a coalition government in the Alaska Senate. As a result of these legislative and gubernatorial results, Democrats gained government trifectas in Michigan for the first time since 1985, and in Massachusetts, Maryland, and Minnesota for the first time since 2015. 2022 is the first midterm since 1934 in which the president's party did not lose any state legislative chambers or incumbent senators. It was also the first midterm since 1986 in which either party achieved a net gain of governorships while holding the presidency, and the first since 1934 in which the Democrats did so under a Democratic president. Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida—previously considered one of the nation's most contested swing states—won reelection in a landslide, as did Senator Marco Rubio. More generally, Florida was one of the only states where some evidence of the predicted 'red wave' materialized.\nSix referendums to preserve or expand abortion access uniformly won, including in the states of Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, and Montana, as did those increasing the minimum wage (Nebraska, Nevada, and Washington, D.C.) and expanding Medicaid coverage (South Dakota), while Maryland and Missouri became the latest states to legalize recreational cannabis. Voters in Nevada also approved ranked voting over first-past-the-post, while those in Illinois and Tennessee approved a state constitutional right to collective bargain and a right-to-work law, respectively.\nIssues that favored Democrats included significant concern over extremism and threats to democracy among many Trump-endorsed Republican candidates, the unpopularity of the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision on abortion that reversed Roe v. Wade, the weariness of a potential Trump 2024 campaign, and backlash over the January 6 United States Capitol attack. Candidate quality played a major role, particularly in the Senate, as many Republican candidates became embroiled in scandals during the campaign that led to underperformances in key races. General turnout and turnout among voters aged 18–29, who are a strongly Democratic constituency, were the second-highest (after 2018) of any midterm since the 1970 U.S. elections. The elections maintained demographic trends that began in 2012, in which Republicans made gains among the working class, especially White people. Republicans continued their trend since 2016 of making gains among minorities, including Latinos. Democrats continued their trend of improved performance among White college-educated voters.","content":"#Background\n#Campaign\n##Primaries\n##Issues\n###Economy\n###Abortion\n###Crime and gun violence\n###Democracy\n###Education\n###Climate change\n###Immigration\n###Student loan forgiveness\n###Presidency of Joe Biden\n###Russian invasion of Ukraine\n##Campaign spending\n#Federal elections\n##Senate elections\n###Special elections\n###Post-election party switches\n##House of Representatives elections\n###Special elections\n#State elections\n##Gubernatorial elections\n##Other state executive elections\n##State judicial elections\n##Legislative elections\n##Referendums\n#Local elections\n#Tribal elections\n#Table of state, territorial, and federal results\n#Aftermath\n##Results\n##January 2023 speaker election\n##Analysis\n###Close results\n###Demographic trends\n###Polling and predictions by pundits\n###Potential green wave\n###Speculation about 2024 elections\n###Turnout\n#Firsts\n#Election night television viewership\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

There are numerous forms of the name in different languages; these were formerly often simply translated as \"John\" in English but are increasingly left in their native forms (see sidebar).\nIt is among the most commonly given names in Anglophone, Arabic, European, Latin American, Iranian, and Turkic countries. Traditionally in the Anglosphere, it was the most common, although it has not been since the latter half of the 20th century. John owes its unique popularity to two highly revered saints, John the Baptist (forerunner of Jesus Christ) and the apostle John (traditionally considered the author of the Gospel of John); the name has since been chosen as the regnal or religious name of many emperors, kings, popes and patriarchs. Initially, it was a favorite name among the Greeks, but it flourished in all of Europe after the First Crusade.","content":"#Origins\n##Germanic derivatives\n#Name statistics\n#In other languages\n#People named John\n##Royalty\n##Politicians\n##Businessmen\n##Military\n##Musicians\n##Scientists\n##Writers\n##Actors\n##Sportsmen\n##Criminals\n##Colonial people\n##Others\n#Pseudonyms\n#Fictional characters\n#See also\n","lang":"en"}
{"title":"Merenre_Nemtyemsaf_I","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Merenre_Nemtyemsaf_I","summary":"Merenre Nemtyemsaf (meaning \"Beloved of Ra, Nemty is his protection\") was an Ancient Egyptian pharaoh, fourth king of the Sixth Dynasty. He ruled Egypt for six to 11 years in the early 23rd century BC, toward the end of the Old Kingdom period. He was the son of his predecessor Pepi I Meryre and queen Ankhesenpepi I and was in turn succeeded by Pepi II Neferkare who might have been his son or less probably his brother. Pepi I may have shared power with Merenre in a co-regency at the very end of the former's reign.\nMerenre's rule saw profound changes in the administration of the southern provinces of Egypt, with a marked increase in the number of \nprovincial administrators and a concurrent steep decline in the size of the central administration in the capital Memphis. As a consequence the provincial nobility became responsible for tax collection and resource management, gaining in political independence and economic power. This led to the first provincial burials for the highest officials including viziers, governors of Upper Egypt and nomarchs.\nSeveral trading and quarrying expeditions took place under Merenre, in particular to Nubia where caravans numbering hundreds of donkeys were sent to fetch incense, ebony, animal skins, ivory and exotic animals. Such was the interest in the region that Merenre had a canal dug to facilitate the navigation of the first cataract into Nubia. Trade with the Levantine coast for lapis lazuli, silver, bitumen, and tin took place while quarrying for granite, travertine and alabaster took place in the south and in the Eastern Desert.\nA pyramid complex was built for Merenre in Saqqara, known as Khanefermerenre by the Ancient Egyptians meaning \"The appearance of the perfection of Merenre\" and likely completed prior to the king's death. The subterranean chambers were inscribed with the Pyramid Texts. In the burial chamber, the black basalt sarcophagus of the king still held a mummy when it was entered in the 19th century. The identification of the mummy as Merenre's is still uncertain. Following his death, Merenre was the object of a funerary cult until at least the end of the Old Kingdom. During the New Kingdom period, he was in a selection of past kings to be honoured.","content":"#Family\n##Parents and siblings\n##Consorts and children\n#Reign\n##Attestations\n##Chronology\n###Relative\n###Absolute\n##Duration\n##Accession to the throne: co-regency\n##Domestic activities\n###Administration\n###Cultic activities\n###Construction works\n##End of reign\n#Foreign activities\n##Eastern Desert and Levant\n##Nubia\n#Pyramid complex\n##Main pyramid\n##Mortuary temple\n##Mummy\n#Legacy\n##Old Kingdom\n##Later periods\n#Notes\n#References\n","lang":"en"}

Strong, destructive tornadoes form most frequently in the United States, Argentina, Brazil, Bangladesh and East India, but can occur almost anywhere. Tornadoes develop occasionally in southern Canada during the Northern Hemisphere's summer, and at other times of the year across Europe, Asia, Argentina, Australia and New Zealand. They are often accompanied by other forms of severe weather, including thunderstorms, strong winds, and large hail. Worldwide, 116 tornado-related deaths were confirmed – 83 in the United States, 12 in China, nine in Indonesia, eight in Myanmar, three in Turkey, and one in Saudi Arabia.\nJanuary had the third-highest number of tornado watches and confirmed tornadoes of any January on record in the United States. The first two months of the year had the fourth-highest number of confirmed tornadoes for the first 59 days of any year on record. The year was deadlier than average, with a number of fatal tornadoes. By April 5, 63 tornado-related deaths were recorded in the United States; this was almost three times higher than 2022's total of 23 fatalities, approaching the annual average of roughly 70 deaths. Below-average tornadic activity occurred in May, but active weather patterns spawned damaging tornado outbreaks throughout the summer and 12 more people died. Damaging tornadoes also affected parts of Canada during that time, including the country's first violent tornado since 2018. Tornadic activity decreased dramatically in September, and was almost non-existent during much of the autumn. Most Atlantic tropical cyclones missed the United States during the peak of hurricane season, with few early-season frontal systems; an intense outbreak in December produced 18 tornadoes, causing seven fatalities.\nSeveral European organizations, including the European Severe Storms Laboratory and Deutscher Wetterdienst, began publishing and using the new International Fujita scale in August 2023. The first major tornado outbreak using the scale occurred three months later, when Storm Ciarán affected much of Europe.","content":"#North America\n##United States tornadoes by month\n#January\n##January 2–4 (United States)\n##January 12 (United States)\n##January 24–25 (United States)\n#February\n##February 16–17 (United States)\n##February 26–27 (United States)\n#March\n##March 1–3 (United States)\n##March 22 (California)\n##March 24–27 (United States)\n##March 31 – April 1 (United States)\n#April\n##April 4–5 (United States)\n##April 15 (United States)\n##April 19–20 (United States)\n##April 27–30 (United States)\n#May\n##May 6–7 (United States)\n##May 10–13 (United States)\n#June\n##June 14–19 (United States)\n##June 20–26 (United States and Canada)\n#July\n##July 1 (Canada)\n##July 12–13 (United States and Canada)\n##July 19 (North Carolina)\n#August\n##August 4–8 (United States)\n##August 18 (United States)\n##August 24–25 (United States and Canada)\n#October\n##October 11–12 (Florida)\n#December\n##December 9–10 (United States)\n#Europe\n##January 17 (Italy)\n##February 1 (Germany)\n##March 9 (France)\n##April 10 (Europe)\n##April 20 (Turkey)\n##May 6 (Europe)\n##July 22 (Italy)\n##August 1 (Europe)\n##September 17 (Europe)\n##September 19 (Denmark)\n##September 21 (Germany)\n##October 28 (United Kingdom)\n##November 1–4 (Europe)\n##November 25 (Greece)\n##December 10 (Ireland)\n##December 21 (Germany)\n##December 22 (Poland)\n##December 27 (United Kingdom)\n#Asia\n##March 13 (Saudi Arabia)\n##March 24 (India)\n##April 15 (China)\n##April 21 (Myanmar)\n##April 22–23 (Oman)\n##April 28 (Indonesia)\n##June 1 (China)\n##June 14 (Pakistan)\n##July 17 (China)\n##August 13 (China)\n##September 19 (China)\n#Elsewhere\n##April 9–11 (New Zealand)\n##July 12 (Brazil)\n##October 4 (Brazil)\n##December 12 (Australia)\n##December 25 (Australia)\n#Tornadic research\n#See also\n#Notes\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Shinzo_Abe","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Shinzo_Abe","summary":"Shinzo Abe (Japanese: 安倍 晋三, Hepburn: Abe Shinzō, IPA: [abe ɕindzoː]; 21 September 1954 – 8 July 2022) was a Japanese statesman and conservative politician who served as the prime minister of Japan and president of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) from 2006 to 2007 and again from 2012 to 2020. He was the longest-serving prime minister in Japanese history, serving for almost nine years in total. Abe also served as Chief Cabinet Secretary from 2005 to 2006 under Junichiro Koizumi and was briefly the opposition leader in 2012.\nAbe was born into the prominent Satō–Kishi–Abe family in Tokyo as the grandson of Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi. After graduating from Seikei University and briefly attending the University of Southern California, Abe was elected to the Japanese House of Representatives in the 1993 election. Abe was appointed Chief Cabinet Secretary by Prime Minister Koizumi in 2005 before replacing him as prime minister and LDP president the following year. Confirmed by the National Diet, Abe became Japan's youngest post-war prime minister and the first born after World War II. Abe resigned as prime minister a year later due to ulcerative colitis and his party's recent election losses. After recovering, Abe staged an unexpected political comeback by defeating Shigeru Ishiba, the former defense minister, to become LDP president in 2012. Following the LDP's landslide victory in that year's general election, Abe became the first former prime minister to return to office since Shigeru Yoshida in 1948. He led the LDP to further victories in the 2014 and 2017 elections, becoming Japan's longest-serving prime minister. In 2020, Abe again resigned as prime minister, citing a relapse of his colitis, and was succeeded by Yoshihide Suga.\nAbe was a staunch conservative and associated with the Nippon Kaigi, which holds negationist views on Japanese history, including denying the role of government coercion in the recruitment of comfort women during World War II, a position which caused tensions particularly with South Korea. Under his premiership, Japan–South Korea relations further strained in 2019 over disputes about reparations. Earlier that same year, Abe's government initiated a trade dispute with South Korea after the South Korean Supreme Court ruled that reparations be made by Japanese companies who had benefited from forced labor. Abe was considered a hard-liner with respect to Japan's military policies. In 2007, he initiated the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue during his first tenure as prime minister, aimed at resisting China's rise as a superpower. He advocated for amending Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution to legally codify the status of the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF). However, this was never achieved during his lifetime. He enacted military reforms in 2015 that allowed Japan to exercise collective security by allowing JSDF deployments overseas, the passage of which was controversial and met with protests. Economically, Abe attempted to counter Japan's economic stagnation with \"Abenomics\", with mixed results. He was also credited with reinstating the Trans-Pacific Partnership with the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership.\nOn 8 July 2022, Abe was assassinated while delivering a campaign speech in Nara two days before the 10 July upper house elections. The suspect, Tetsuya Yamagami, who was immediately arrested by Japanese police, confessed to targeting the former prime minister because of Abe's reported ties with the Unification Church. This was the first assassination of a former Japanese prime minister since 1936. A polarizing figure in Japanese politics, Abe was described by supporters as having worked to strengthen Japan's security and international stature, while opponents described his nationalistic policies and negationist views on history as threatening Japanese pacifism and damaging relations with East Asian neighbors including China and South Korea.","content":"#Early life\n##Family\n##Education and early career\n#Member of the House of Representatives\n#First term as prime minister (2006–2007)\n##Inauguration and cabinet\n##Domestic policy\n##Foreign policy\n###North Korea\n###East and Southeast Asia\n###India\n##Defense\n##Resignation\n#Out of office (2007–2012)\n#Second LDP presidency and 2012 general election\n#Second term as prime minister (2012–2014)\n##Economic policy\n###\"First Arrow\": Monetary policy\n###\"Second Arrow\": Fiscal policy\n###\"Third Arrow\": Growth strategy and structural reform\n##2013 Upper House election\n##Domestic policy\n##Foreign policy\n##Defense and security policy\n##2014 cabinet reshuffle\n##2014 general election\n#Third term as prime minister (2014–2017)\n##Foreign policy\n##Security and defense issues\n##Re-election as LDP president and \"Abenomics 2.0\"\n##Constitutional revision\n#Fourth term as prime minister (2017–2020)\n##Re-election as LDP president\n##Favoritism scandals\n##Foreign policy\n##Economic policy\n##Whaling\n##Resignation\n#Assassination\n#Controversies and issues\n##Historical negationism\n##Response to the mass media\n##Yasukuni Shrine\n##Photographs with \"731\"\n##Restoration of Sovereignty Day\n##Migratory policies\n#Personal life\n#Legacy\n#Honors, awards and international recognition\n##Domestic honors\n##Foreign honors\n##Other honors\n##Awards\n##Honorary doctorates\n#See also\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

Based on Charles Perrault's 1697 fairy tale, the production was supervised by Clyde Geronimi, and was directed by Wolfgang Reitherman, Eric Larson, and Les Clark. Featuring the voices of Mary Costa, Bill Shirley, Eleanor Audley, Verna Felton, Barbara Luddy, Barbara Jo Allen, Taylor Holmes, and Bill Thompson, the film follows Princess Aurora, who was cursed by the evil fairy Maleficent to die from pricking her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel. She is saved by three good fairies, who alter Aurora's curse so that she falls into a deep sleep and will be awakened by true love's kiss.\nSleeping Beauty began development in 1950. The film took nearly a decade and $6 million (equivalent to $62,712,329 in 2023) to produce, and was Disney's most expensive animated feature at the time. Its tapestry-like art style was devised by Eyvind Earle, who was inspired by pre-Renaissance European art; its score and songs, composed by George Bruns, was based on Pyotr Tchaikovsky's 1889 ballet. Sleeping Beauty was the first animated film to use the Super Technirama 70 widescreen process and was the second full-length animated feature filmed in anamorphic widescreen, following Lady and the Tramp (1955).\nIt was released in theaters on January 29, 1959, to mixed reviews from critics who praised its art direction and musical score, but criticized its plot and characters. The film was a box-office bomb in its initial release, grossing $5.3 million (equivalent to $55,395,890 in 2023), and losing $900,000 (equivalent to $9,406,849 in 2023) for the distributor and many employees from the animation studio became layoffs. Sleeping Beauty's re-releases have been successful, and it has become one of Disney's most artistically acclaimed features. The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Scoring of a Musical Picture at the 32nd Academy Awards.\nMaleficent, a live-action reimagining of the film from Maleficent's perspective, was released in 2014, followed by a sequel, Maleficent: Mistress of Evil, in 2019. The latter year, Sleeping Beauty was selected for preservation in the United States Library of Congress' National Film Registry as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".","content":"#Plot\n#Voice cast\n#Production\n##Story development\n##Casting\n##Production delays\n##Animation\n###Art direction\n###Live-action reference\n###Character animation\n##Music\n#Release\n##Original theatrical run\n##Re-releases\n##Home media\n###Lawsuit\n#Reception\n##Critical response\n##Accolades\n#Legacy\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Roswell_incident","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Roswell_incident","summary":"The Roswell incident is a conspiracy theory which alleges that the 1947 United States Army Air Forces balloon recovered near Roswell, New Mexico was actually a crashed extraterrestrial spacecraft.  Operated from the nearby Alamogordo Army Air Field and part of the top secret Project Mogul, the balloon was intended to detect Soviet nuclear tests. After metallic and rubber debris were recovered by Roswell Army Air Field personnel, the United States Army announced their possession of a \"flying disc\". This announcement made international headlines but was retracted within a day. Obscuring the true purpose and source of the crashed balloon, the Army subsequently stated that it was a conventional weather balloon.\nIn 1978, retired Air Force officer Jesse Marcel revealed that the Army's weather balloon claim had been a cover story, but speculated that the debris was of extraterrestrial origin. Popularized by the 1980 book The Roswell Incident, this speculation became the basis for long-lasting and increasingly complex and contradictory UFO conspiracy theories, which over time expanded the incident to include governments concealing evidence of extraterrestrial beings, grey aliens, multiple crashed flying saucers, alien corpses and autopsies, and the reverse engineering of extraterrestrial technology, none of which have any factual basis.\nIn the 1990s, the United States Air Force published multiple reports establishing Project Mogul as being directly responsible for the crash.  Mogul was a top secret balloon program that sought to detect evidence of Soviet atomic tests. Despite this and lack of evidence, many UFO proponents claim that the Roswell debris was derived from an alien craft, and accuse the US government of a cover-up. The conspiracy narrative has become a trope in science fiction literature, film, and television. The town of Roswell leverages this to promote itself as a destination for UFO-associated tourism.","content":"#1947 military balloon crash\n#UFO conspiracy theories (1947–1978)\n##Aztec crashed saucer hoax\n##Hangar 18\n#Roswell conspiracy theories (1978–1994)\n##The Roswell Incident\n##Majestic 12 hoax\n##Role of Glenn Dennis\n##Competing accounts and schism\n###UFO Crash at Roswell\n###Crash at Corona\n###The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell\n#Air Force response\n#Later theories and hoaxes (1994–present)\n##Alien Autopsy\n##The Day After Roswell\n##Related debunked or fringe theories\n#Explanations\n##Project Mogul\n##Anthropomorphic dummies\n##Roswell as modern myth and folklore\n#Cultural impact\n##Tourism and commercialization\n##Popular fiction\n##Statements by US Presidents\n#See also\n#References\n##Sources\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"2024_Republican_Party_presidential_primaries","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2024_Republican_Party_presidential_primaries","summary":"Presidential primaries and caucuses of the Republican Party took place within all 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and five U.S. territories between January 15, 2024, and June 4, 2024, ahead of the 2024 United States presidential election. These elections selected most of the 2,429 delegates to be sent to the Republican National Convention. Former president Donald Trump was nominated for president of the United States for a third consecutive election cycle.\nIn 2023, a crowded field of candidates emerged, including Florida governor Ron DeSantis, former Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, wealth management executive Vivek Ramaswamy, and former president Donald Trump. Trump maintained a consistent lead in primary polling since 2020. Among non-Trump candidates, DeSantis initially polled in a close second behind Trump, but his polling numbers steadily declined throughout 2023. Ramaswamy experienced a small polling bump in mid-2023, but this proved to be brief. Haley's campaign began attracting greater attention in the final months of 2023, though neither she nor any other candidate came close to Trump in polling. The Republican primaries were referred to as a \"race for second\" due to Trump's consistent lead in polls.\nAt the January 15 Iowa caucuses, Trump posted a landslide victory, with DeSantis narrowly beating out Haley for second place and Ramaswamy in a distant fourth. Following the Iowa caucuses, Ramaswamy and DeSantis dropped out of the race and endorsed Trump, leaving Trump and Haley as the only remaining major candidates. Trump then defeated Haley in the January 23 New Hampshire primary, albeit by a smaller margin of victory than he achieved in Iowa; he defeated Haley again in the February 24 South Carolina primary a month later. After Trump's overwhelming victories nationwide on Super Tuesday, Haley suspended her campaign on March 6, having only won Vermont and the District of Columbia.\nSome Republicans have expressed concerns about Trump's candidacy due to his loss in 2020, his alleged role in inciting the January 6 Capitol attack, ongoing criminal cases against him, and the results of the 2022 midterms (in which several Trump-endorsed candidates lost key races). However, many others have supported him and decried the investigations as politically motivated. Trump maintains high favorability ratings among Republican voters. Trump's eligibility to appear on the ballot was challenged by some voters and political leaders in Colorado, Maine and Illinois, but these efforts were rejected by the Supreme Court of the United States in a unanimous decision. Trump became the presumptive nominee on March 12, with his victory in the Washington primary bringing him over the 1,215 delegate threshold needed to clinch the nomination.\nOn July 15, 2024, Trump and his running mate, U.S. Senator from Ohio JD Vance, were officially nominated as the Republican presidential and vice presidential candidates at the Republican National Convention.","content":"#Results\n#Candidates\n##Nominee\n###Other candidates\n##Withdrew during the primaries\n###Other candidates\n##Withdrew before the primaries\n###Other candidates\n#Timeline\n##2022\n###November 2022\n##2023\n###February 2023\n###March 2023\n###April 2023\n###May 2023\n###June 2023\n###August 2023\n###September 2023\n###October 2023\n###November 2023\n###December 2023\n##2024\n###January 2024\n###February 2024\n###March 2024\n###April 2024\n###May 2024\n###June 2024\n###July 2024\n##Eligibility\n##Overview\n##Ballot access\n#Debates\n#Endorsements\n#Opinion polling\n#Maps\n#Campaign finance\n#Primaries and caucus calendar\n##Timing\n###Nevada controversy\n###Michigan controversy\n##Delegates\n#See also\n#Notes\n","lang":"en"}
{"title":"Rock-climbing_equipment","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rock-climbing_equipment","summary":"Rock-climbing equipment varies with the specific type of climbing that is undertaken. Bouldering needs the least equipment outside of climbing shoes, climbing chalk and optional crash pads.  Sport climbing adds ropes, harnesses, belay devices, and quickdraws to clip into pre-drilled bolts. Traditional climbing adds the need to carry a \"rack\" of temporary passive and active protection devices.  Multi-pitch climbing, and the related big wall climbing, adds devices to assist in ascending and descending fixed ropes. Finally, aid climbing uses unique equipment to give mechanical assistance to the climber in their upward movement (e.g. aiders).\nAdvances in equipment are a key part of the rock climbing history, starting with the climbing rope.  Modern devices enable climbers to perform tasks previously done manually, with greater control – in all conditions – and with less effort. Examples of replacements include the harness (replaced tying the rope around the waist), the carabiner (replaced many knots), the descender\/abseil device (replaced the dülfersitz), the ascender (replaced the prusik knot), the belay device (replaced the body belay), and nuts\/hexes (replaced chockstones).\nModern equipment includes dynamic ropes, plyometric training tools, advanced spring-loaded camming devices (SLCDs) for protection, and advanced rope control devices such as self-locking devices (SLDs), progress capture devices (PCDs), and assisted braking devices (ABDs). Modern equipment uses advanced materials that are increasingly more durable, stronger, and lighter (e.g. spectra\/dyneema and aluminum alloys).  The equipment must meet specific standards (e.g. the UIAA standards) for strength, durability, and reliability, and must be certified and tested against such standards with individual pieces carrying such certification marks.","content":"#Use and certification\n##Type of climbing\n##Certification\n#Ropes and slings\n##Ropes\n##Slings\n##Cords\n#Rope connectors\n##Carabiners\n##Harnesses\n##Lanyards\n###Personal anchor systems\n##Quickdraws\n#Rope devices\n##Ascenders\n##Belay devices\n##Descenders\n##Self-locking devices\n#Protection devices\n##Temporary\n###Active\n###Passive\n##Fixed\n#Aid equipment\n#Clothing equipment\n#Miscellaneous equipment\n#Training equipment\n#See also\n##Manufacturers\n##Types\n#References\n##Further reading\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"2023_Indian_wrestlers'_protest","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2023_Indian_wrestlers'_protest","summary":"In January 2023, Indian wrestlers began protesting for investigation into allegations of sexual harassment of female wrestlers by BJP MP Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh during his tenure as the president of the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI). The female wrestler complainants accused Bhushan of groping, touching their breasts and navels without consent, stalking, intimidation, and demanding \"sexual favours\" in exchange for professional help, all of which led to a \"shared sense of fear and trauma\" among the women wrestlers. Bhushan has denied all allegations in front of a government appointed committee.\nThe sit-in protests were organized at Jantar Mantar, New Delhi in January 2023, making the sexual harassment allegations against Bhushan public. After an assurance that the Central Government will form a committee to look into the allegations, the protests were called off in January 2023. The report by the committee was submitted on 5 April 2023 but not made public. The protesters resumed their protest on 23 April 2023, citing inaction by authorities and bias by the committee to favor the accused.\nBhushan belongs to the Bharatiya Janata Party, which leads the Central government and hence oversees the Delhi Police, the law enforcement agency in Delhi. Delhi Police had been accused of inaction and refusing to register a first information report (FIR). The FIRs were registered only after Supreme Court's intervention even though Indian Law mandates immediate registration of an FIR for cognizable offences like sexual harassment. Bhushan was booked under the POCSO act in which all offenses qualify as cognizable.\nMany organizations and opposition parties have accused the government of trying to protect Bhushan, a member of the ruling party. The protesting wrestlers have accused the government of building pressure on them to withdraw their cases against Bhushan. The prime minister Narendra Modi and the Union home minister Amit Shah have both been criticized by the opposition parties for being silent on the case, and Sakshi Malik, one of the protesting wrestlers, said she is \"hurt\" due to Modi's silence.\nSeveral politicians extended their support to the protests and visited the protest site. Many leading athletes also voiced their support. Many farm unions extended support to the protests claiming that the wrestlers come from farming communities.\nThe WFI's term expired in December 2021, but due to the controversies, elections were not held. This delay ultimately led to the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) dissolving the WFI's executive body and appointing an ad-hoc committee to oversee its operations in July 2023.  The allegations fueled protests and demands for Brij Bhusan’s removal from the post. As a result, the ad-hoc committee decided to conduct repolls on an urgent basis to ensure a transparent and accountable leadership for the WFI. \nInternational sporting bodies United World Wrestling and International Olympic Committee have condemned the manhandling, arrest and temporary detention of the wrestlers on 28 May 2023, and urged the authorities to investigate the allegations against Bhushan failing which Indian athletes would be forced to participate under a neutral flag.\nOn 25 June 2023, the protesting wrestlers announced they would cease their agitation and expressed their intention to pursue the fight through legal means, rather than through public demonstrations. However, on 24 December 2023, the Union Sports Ministry suspended the newly elected WFI body led by Sanjay Singh citing the WFI's disregard for established policies and procedures.","content":"#Background\n#Initial investigation\n#Protest overview\n##FIR registration and Supreme court intervention\n##Jantar Mantar clash\n##Formation of SIT and questioning of witnesses\n##New Parliament House march and detainment\n##Meeting with Sports Minister and filing chargesheet\n#Aftermath\n#Reactions\n##Domestic\n###Criticism\n##International\n###United World Wrestling\n###International Olympic Committee\n###Parliamentarians\n#Media coverage\n#Impact\n#Gallery\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Febrile_seizure","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Febrile_seizure","summary":"A febrile seizure, also known as a fever fit or febrile convulsion, is a seizure associated with a high body temperature but without any serious underlying health issue. They most commonly occur in children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years. Most seizures are less than five minutes in duration, and the child is completely back to normal within an hour of the event. There are two types: simple febrile seizures and complex febrile seizures. Simple febrile seizures involve an otherwise healthy child who has at most one tonic-clonic seizure lasting less than 15 minutes in a 24-hour period. Complex febrile seizures have focal symptoms, last longer than 15 minutes, or occur more than once within 24 hours. About 80% are classified as simple febrile seizures.\nFebrile seizures are triggered by fever, typically due to a viral infection. They may run in families. The underlying mechanism is not fully known, but it is thought to involve genetics, environmental factors, brain immaturity, and inflammatory mediators. The diagnosis involves verifying that there is not an infection of the brain, there are no metabolic problems, and there have not been prior seizures that have occurred without a fever. Blood testing, imaging of the brain, or an electroencephalogram (EEG) is typically not needed. Examination to determine the source of the fever is recommended. In otherwise healthy-looking children a lumbar puncture is not necessarily required.\nNeither anti-seizure medication nor anti-fever medication are recommended in an effort to prevent further simple febrile seizures. In the few cases that last greater than 5 minutes, a benzodiazepine such as lorazepam or midazolam may be used. Efforts to rapidly cool during a seizure is not recommended.\nFebrile seizures affect 2–10% of children. They are more common in boys than girls. After a single febrile seizure there is an approximately 35% chance of having another one during childhood. Outcomes are generally excellent with similar academic achievements to other children and no change in the risk of death for those with simple seizures. There is tentative evidence that affected children have a slightly increased risk of epilepsy at 2% compared to the general population.","content":"#Signs and symptoms\n##Types\n#Causes\n#Mechanism\n#Diagnosis\n#Prevention\n#Treatment\n#Prognosis\n#Epidemiology\n#References\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Arched_harp","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Arched_harp","summary":"Arched harps is a category in the Hornbostel-Sachs classification system for musical instruments, a type of harp. The instrument may also be called  bow harp. With arched harps, the neck forms a continuous arc with the body and has an open gap between the two ends of the arc (open harps).\nArched harps are probably the most ancient form of the harp, evolving from the musical bow. The first bowed harps appeared around 3000 B.C. in Iran and Mesopotamia and then in Egypt. India may have had the instrument as early as Mesopotamia.\nThe horizontal arched-bow from Sumeria spread west to ancient Greece, Rome and Minoan Crete and eastward to India. Like Egypt, however, India continued to develop the instrument on its own; undated artwork in caves shows a harp resembling a musical bow, with improvised resonators of different shapes and different numbers of added strings.\nWhen the angular harp replaced the arched harp about 2000 B.C. in the Middle East and spread along the Silk Road, the arched harp was retained in India until after 800 A.D. (a form of ancient vina), and in Egypt until the Hellenistic Age (after 500 B.C). It can still be found today in Sub-Saharan Africa.\nFrom India the arched harp was introduced into Malaysia, as well as Champa and Burma (as early as 500 A.D.) where it is still played under the name of saung, and in 7th-century A.D. Cambodia as the pin\nBhuddists were involved with the spread of the arched harp in Asia. Artwork depicting the arched harp that survived in China, Malaysia, Indonesia, Burma, and Cambodia comes from Buddhist communities. The harp disappeared in India about the time when Hinduism displaced Buddhism. The Buddhists took the harp north from India along the silk road to China, where it was painted in the Mogao Caves and Yulin Grottos. Additionally, Buddhist Burma sent two types of harp to Chinese court to perform, including the phoenix-headed harp.  The latter became known in China as the Phoenix-headed konghou.\nPortable bowed harps may have made their way from Egypt up the Nile to East Africa and, branching off from this route, also to Central and West Africa.\nAlternative, the arched harp may have entered Sub-Saharan Africa from Indonesia, during trade in the Middle Ages.","content":"#Description\n##Classification\n##Structure\n##Variations\n#History\n##Earliest harp image\n##Another early image\n#Distribution\n##Mesopotamia\n##India, Indochina\n###Spread of the arched harp from India\n###Nuristan\n###Southeast Asia, Burma\n###Southeast Asia, Cambodia\n###Karen harp\n##China\n##Egypt\n###Egypt gallery\n###Egyptian hieroglyphs\n##Greece and Rome\n##Sub-Saharan Africa\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}
{"title":"Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel","summary":"Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (27 August 1770 – 14 November 1831) was a German philosopher and one of the most influential figures of German idealism and 19th-century philosophy. His influence extends across the entire range of contemporary philosophical topics, from metaphysical issues in epistemology and ontology, to political philosophy, the philosophy of history, philosophy of art, philosophy of religion, and the history of philosophy.\nBorn in 1770 in Stuttgart, Holy Roman Empire, during the transitional period between the Enlightenment and the Romantic movement in the Germanic regions of Europe, Hegel lived through and was influenced by the French Revolution and the Napoleonic wars. His fame rests chiefly upon The Phenomenology of Spirit, The Science of Logic, his teleological account of history, and his lectures at the University of Berlin on topics from his Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences.\nThroughout his work, Hegel strove to address and correct the problematic dualisms of modern philosophy, Kantian and otherwise, typically by drawing upon the resources of ancient philosophy, particularly Aristotle. Hegel everywhere insists that reason and freedom are historical achievements, not natural givens. His dialectical-speculative procedure is grounded in the principle of immanence, that is, in assessing claims always according to their own internal criteria. Taking skepticism seriously, he contends that people cannot presume any truths that have not passed the test of experience; even the a priori categories of the Logic must attain their \"verification\" in the natural world and the historical accomplishments of humankind.\nGuided by the Delphic imperative to \"know thyself\", Hegel presents free self-determination as the essence of humankind – a conclusion from his 1806–07 Phenomenology that he claims is further verified by the systematic account of the interdependence of logic, nature, and spirit in his later Encyclopedia. He asserts that the Logic at once preserves and overcomes the dualisms of the material and the mental – that is, it accounts for both the continuity and difference marking the domains of nature and culture – as a metaphysically necessary and coherent \"identity of identity and non-identity\".","content":"#Life\n##Formative years\n###Stuttgart, Tübingen, Berne, Frankfurt (1770–1800)\n##Career years\n###Jena, Bamberg, Nuremberg (1801–1816)\n###Heidelberg, Berlin (1816–1831)\n#Influences\n#The Phenomenology of Spirit\n#Philosophical system\n##Science of Logic\n##Philosophy of the real\n##The Philosophy of Nature\n##The Philosophy of Spirit\n###Subjective spirit\n###Objective spirit\n###Absolute spirit\n#Philosophy of art\n#Christianity\n##Early Romantic writings\n##The Phenomenology of Spirit\n##The Berlin lectures\n##Issues of interpretation\n#Philosophy of history\n#Dialectics, speculation, idealism\n##Thesis–antithesis–synthesis\n#Reception\n##\"Right\" vs. \"Left\" Hegelianism\n##Reception in France\n##American pragmatism\n#Publications and other writings\n##Berlin lecture series\n#Notes\n##Explanatory notes\n##Citations\n#Sources\n##Primary\n##Secondary\n#External links\n##Societies\n##Audio and video\n##Hegel texts online\n##Other resources\n","lang":"en"}

They were widely described as sham referendums by commentators and denounced by various countries. The validity of the results of the referendums has been accepted by North Korea, and no other sovereign state.\nThe votes were conducted in four areas of Ukraine – the Russian puppet states of the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic in the Russian-occupied Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts of Ukraine, and the Russian-appointed military administrations of Kherson Oblast and Zaporizhzhia Oblast, captured and occupied in the first week of the 2022 invasion – as well as in Russia. At the time of the referendums, Russia did not fully control any of the four regions, where military hostilities were ongoing at the time. Much of the population had fled since the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The referendums were illegal under international law and have been condemned by the United Nations as violations of the United Nations Charter.\nOn 30 September 2022, Russia's president Vladimir Putin announced the annexation of Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia oblasts of Ukraine in an address to both houses of the Russian parliament.

{"title":"James_Madison","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/James_Madison","summary":"James Madison (March 16, 1751 – June 28, 1836) was an American statesman, diplomat, and Founding Father who served as the fourth president of the United States from 1809 to 1817. Madison was popularly acclaimed the \"Father of the Constitution\" for his pivotal role in drafting and promoting the Constitution of the United States and the Bill of Rights.\nMadison was born into a prominent slave-owning planter family in Virginia. He was a member of the Virginia House of Delegates and the Continental Congress during and after the American Revolutionary War. Dissatisfied with the weak national government established by the Articles of Confederation, he helped organize the Constitutional Convention, which produced a new constitution designed to strengthen republican government against democratic assembly. Madison's Virginia Plan was the basis for the convention's deliberations. He became one of the leaders in the movement to ratify the Constitution and joined Alexander Hamilton and John Jay in writing The Federalist Papers, a series of pro-ratification essays that remains prominent among works of political science in American history. Madison emerged as an important leader in the House of Representatives and was a close adviser to President George Washington. During the early 1790s, Madison opposed the economic program and the accompanying centralization of power favored by Secretary of the Treasury Hamilton. Alongside Thomas Jefferson, he organized the Democratic–Republican Party in opposition to Hamilton's Federalist Party. Madison served as Jefferson's Secretary of State from 1801 to 1809, during which time Jefferson made the Louisiana Purchase. \nMadison was elected president in 1808. Motivated by desire to acquire land held by Britain, Spain, and Native Americans, and after diplomatic protests with a trade embargo failed to end British seizures of American shipped goods, Madison led the United States into the War of 1812. Although the war ended inconclusively, many Americans viewed it as a successful \"second war of independence\" against Britain. Madison was re-elected in 1812. The war convinced Madison of the necessity of a stronger federal government. He presided over the creation of the Second Bank of the United States and the enactment of the protective Tariff of 1816. By treaty or through war, Native American tribes ceded 26,000,000 acres (11,000,000 ha) of land to the United States under Madison's presidency.\nRetiring from public office at the end of his presidency in 1817, Madison returned to his plantation, Montpelier, and died there in 1836. Madison was a slave owner; he freed one slave in 1783 to prevent a slave rebellion at Montpelier, but did not free any in his will. Among historians, Madison is considered one of the most important Founding Fathers of the United States. Leading historians have generally ranked him as an above-average president, although they are critical of his endorsement of slavery and his leadership during the War of 1812. Madison's name is commemorated in many landmarks across the nation, with prominent examples including Madison Square Garden, James Madison University, the James Madison Memorial Building, and the USS James Madison.","content":"#Early life and education\n#American Revolution and Articles of Confederation\n#Ratification of the Constitution\n#Congressman and party leader (1789–1801)\n##Election to Congress\n##Bill of Rights\n##Founding the Democratic–Republican Party\n##Marriage and family\n##Adams presidency\n#Secretary of State (1801–1809)\n##1808 presidential election\n#Presidency (1809–1817)\n##Inauguration and cabinet\n##War of 1812\n###Prelude to war\n###Military actions\n##Postwar period and decline of the Federalist opposition\n##Native American policy\n##Election of 1816\n#Post-presidency (1817–1836)\n##Death\n#Political and religious views\n##Federalism\n##Religion\n#Slavery\n#Legacy\n#Notes\n#References\n##Citations\n##Sources\n#Further reading\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Anton_Webern","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Anton_Webern","summary":"Anton Webern (German: [ˈantoːn ˈveːbɐn] ; 3 December 1883 – 15 September 1945) was an Austrian composer, conductor, and musicologist. His music was among the most radical of its milieu in its concision and use of then novel atonal and twelve-tone techniques in an increasingly rigorous manner, somewhat after the Franco-Flemish School of his studies under Guido Adler. With his mentor Arnold Schoenberg and his colleague Alban Berg, Webern was at the core of those within the broader circle of the Second Viennese School. Their atonal music brought them fame and stirred debate. Webern was arguably the first and certainly the last of the three to write music in an aphoristic, expressionist style, reflecting his instincts and the idiosyncrasy of his compositional process.\nPeripatetic, unhappy, and often assigned light music and operetta in his early conducting career, he aspired to conduct more established repertoire with more autonomy at home in Vienna. During and after World War I, he set folk, lyric, and spiritual texts in texturally dense Lieder. He came to some prominence and increasingly high regard as a vocal coach, choirmaster, conductor, and teacher in Red Vienna. With a publication contract through Emil Hertzka's Universal Edition and Schoenberg away at the Prussian Academy of Arts, Webern wrote music of increasing confidence, independence, and scale using twelve-tone technique. He maintained his \"path to the new music\" while marginalized as a \"cultural Bolshevist\" effectively until his death.\nA variety of post-World War II musicians celebrated his music, much of which was first published only then or later still. Among these were many composers influenced especially by his twelve-tone music in a phenomenon known as post-Webernism, linking but not restricting Webern's legacy to serialism. Understanding of his musical semantics or semiotics, performance practice, and sociocultural contexts was widely fledgling after years of severe disruption. This was gradually improved by musicians and scholars who helped publish and record his works as well as establish his music as modernist repertoire. A Gesamtausgabe (complete edition) is pending.","content":"#Biography\n##1883–1908: Upbringing between late Imperial Vienna and countryside\n###Bucolic Heimat\n###University\n###Schoenberg and his circle\n##1908–1918: Early adulthood in Austria-Hungary and German Empire\n###Marriage\n###Early conducting career\n###Psychotherapy\n###\"Old song\" of \"lost paradise\"\n###World War I\n###Austrian defeat and socioeconomic strain\n##1918–1933: Rise in Rotes Wien (Interwar Vienna)\n###Society for Private Musical Performances\n###Mature conducting career\n###Relative success in a destabilizing society\n##1933–1938: Perseverance in Schwarzes Wien (Austrofascist Vienna)\n###Marginalization at home\n###Besieged milieu and political confusion\n###Visiting conducting career\n##1938–1939: Inner emigration in Nazi Germany\n###Anschluss\n###Kristallnacht and recoil\n##1939–1945: Hope and disillusionment during World War II\n###Swiss and Reich prospects\n###Wartime hopes and reality\n###Refuge and death in Mittersill\n#Music\n##1899–1908: Formative juvenilia and emergence from study\n##1908–1914: Atonality and aphorisms\n##1914–1924: Mid-period Lieder\n##1924–1945: Formal coherence and expansion\n##Arrangements and orchestrations\n#Reception, influence, and legacy\n##Performance practice\n##Contemporaries\n###Artists\n###Musicians\n##1947–1950s: (Re)discovery and post-Webernism\n##1950s onward: Beyond (late) Webern\n##Eastern Europe\n###Eastern Bloc\n###Soviet Russia\n##Dance\n##Since the 1980s: Reappraisals and historiography\n#Recordings by Webern\n#Notes\n#References\n##Bibliography\n#Further reading\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

Five Georgia defensive players were taken during the first round, the most from an individual school in a draft. In addition to the high number of defensive selections, nine offensive linemen were taken in the first round, the most since 2013. Conversely, only one quarterback was selected in the first round at 20th overall, the lowest for a draft's first quarterback since 1997, and no running backs were taken in the first round for the first time since 2014.\nA record nine draft-day trades with first-round picks were made, which resulted in less than half of the first round selections being made by the teams that initially owned them.

{"title":"Hurricane_Fiona","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hurricane_Fiona","summary":"Hurricane Fiona was a large, powerful, and destructive tropical cyclone which was the costliest and most intense tropical or post-tropical cyclone to hit Canada on record. It was the sixth named storm, third hurricane and first major hurricane of the 2022 Atlantic hurricane season.\nFiona developed from a tropical wave that emerged from West Africa, before developing into a tropical depression east of the Leeward Islands on September 14. Though under the influence of moderate to strong wind shear, the system was able to strengthen, becoming Tropical Storm Fiona later that same day. On September 16, Fiona passed over Guadeloupe and entered the Caribbean Sea, where atmospheric conditions improved, and strengthened into a hurricane as it approached Puerto Rico two days later. A few hours afterward, the eye of Fiona made landfall along the southwestern coast of Puerto Rico, near Punta Tocon, between the municipalities of Lajas and Cabo Rojo. The hurricane made landfall in the Dominican Republic shortly thereafter, and then strengthened into the first major hurricane of the season. As the storm slowly moved through the Turks and Caicos, it continued to strengthen and reached Category 4 status the following day, while accelerating north. The storm reached peak 1-minute sustained winds of 140 mph (220 km\/h) and a minimum pressure of 931 mbar (27.49 inHg). After passing Bermuda and weakening to Category 3 intensity, Fiona quickly transitioned into a large and powerful extratropical cyclone and struck Nova Scotia with sustained winds of 100 mph (155 km\/h) early on September 24. Post-tropical Fiona then quickly weakened as it moved through the Gulf of St. Lawrence and over the southeastern Labrador Peninsula. The remnants then dissipated over the Labrador Sea near the southwest coast of Greenland on September 27.\nGuadeloupe received near-record rainfall, leaving 40% of the population without water for a few days. Puerto Rico suffered from the worst flooding since Hurricane Maria of 2017, and an island-wide blackout occurred. A third of the territory's population was left without water, and at least 25 people died. In the Dominican Republic and the Turks and Caicos, the islands were pounded by heavy rainfall and strong winds, causing flooding and blackouts. Fiona was the strongest cyclone on record to make landfall in Canada based on atmospheric pressure and was one of the wettest ever recorded in the country as well.","content":"#Meteorological history\n#Preparations\n#Impact\n##Guadeloupe\n##Puerto Rico\n##Dominican Republic\n##Turks and Caicos\n##Antigua\n##Bermuda\n##Eastern Canada\n#Aftermath\n##Puerto Rico\n##Dominican Republic\n#Retirement\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}
{"title":"Midnights","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Midnights","summary":"Midnights is the tenth studio album by the American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, released on October 21, 2022, by Republic Records. Swift conceived it as a concept album about nocturnal ruminations inspired by her sleepless nights. The autobiographical songwriting explores broad emotions such as regrets, self-criticism, fantasies, heartbreak, and infatuation, using confessional yet cryptic lyrics that allude to her personal life and public image.\nSwift and Jack Antonoff produced the standard edition of Midnights, which features a subdued electronic soundscape, characterized by mid-tempo rhythms, analog synthesizers, sparse drum machine beats, and digitally manipulated vocals. Music critics categorize the album as synth-pop, electropop, dream pop, and bedroom pop, infused with electronica, hip hop, R&B, and alternative elements. Sounwave, Jahaan Sweet, and Keanu Beats shared credits on two tracks, and Aaron Dessner produced additional songs for an extended 3am Edition that was surprise-released three hours after the standard edition.\nSwift announced Midnights at the 2022 MTV Video Music Awards and unveiled the standard track list via the video-sharing platform TikTok. Midnights topped the charts across Europe, Asia-Pacific, and the Americas. In the United States, Midnights was Swift's 11th consecutive number-one album on the Billboard 200, her fifth to sell over one million first-week copies, and the best-selling album of 2022. Its songs made Swift the first artist to monopolize the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100, with the lead single \"Anti-Hero\" peaking at number one; the successive singles \"Lavender Haze\" and \"Karma\" peaked at number two.\nMusic critics regarded Midnights as an amalgamation of Swift's past albums. They praised her songwriting for engaging composition and narratives; most of them complimented the production as restrained and tasteful, although a few found it derivative. Midnights featured on publications' rankings of the best albums of 2022 and won accolades including Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album at the 66th Annual Grammy Awards (2024), making Swift the first artist to win the former category four times. Journalists dubbed the album's critical and commercial successes a testament to Swift's enduring cultural impact. To support Midnights along with her other albums, Swift has embarked on the Eras Tour (2023–2024).","content":"#Background\n#Concept and writing\n##Themes\n#Production and music\n#Artwork and aesthetics\n#Release and promotion\n#Commercial performance\n#Critical reception\n##Rankings\n#Awards\n#Impact\n#Track listing\n#Personnel\n#Charts\n#Certifications and sales\n#Release history\n#See also\n#Footnotes\n#References\n##Sources\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

Wade with its ruling on Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, sparking protests across the country, and eventually the world. America also saw labor unions gain increased traction, with Apple, Starbucks and Amazon among the most notable targets. In conjunction, increased attention to critical race theory, the instruction of gender identity in schools, and the ongoing investigations into both former president Donald Trump and the January 6th attack gained political attention. Mass shootings also became an increasingly common phenomenon, with 641 occurring in 2022 as of December 28, varying from those targeting schools (including the deadliest shooting of the year) to bias-motivated incidents which have targeted racial and sexual minorities.\n\nIn the economy, the United States remained heavily impacted by the global inflation surge, a simultaneous stock market decline and a heavy increase in gasoline prices, all partly due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. America's largest tech companies were hit especially hard by the economy, with Meta Platforms in particular losing nearly $700 billion in valuation. The Federal Reserve gained increased attention with a series of its first aggressive interest rate hikes in years, a trend which continued in 2023, with the federal funds rate by year's end reaching 4.4%. 2022 also marked a period of acquisitions within the tech industry as well, notably Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter and Microsoft's ongoing buyout of Activision Blizzard. Later in the year, the US saw the first major challenges to its gratuity culture; tipflation, as it has since become known, has caused Americans to lower their tips.","content":"#Incumbents\n##Federal government\n#Elections\n##Midterm elections\n###Electoral milestones\n##Special elections and recalls\n#Ongoing events\n#Events\n##January\n##February\n##March\n##April\n##May\n##June\n##July\n##August\n##September\n##October\n##November\n##December\n##Other events during COVID-19 endemic phase\n#Deaths\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

From 2022 the strikes targeted civilian areas beyond the battlefield, particularly critical power infrastructure, which is considered a war crime. By mid-2024 the country only had a third of pre-war electricity generating capacity, and some gas distribution and district heating had been hit.\nOn 10 October 2022 Russia attacked the power grid throughout Ukraine, including the in Kyiv, with a wave of 84 cruise missiles and 24 suicide drones. Further waves struck Ukrainian infrastructure, killing and injuring many, and seriously affecting energy distribution across Ukraine and neighboring countries. By 19 November, nearly half of the country's power grid was out of commission, and 10 million Ukrainians were without electricity, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. By mid-December, Russia had fired more than 1,000 missiles and drones at Ukraine's energy grid. Several waves targeted Kyiv, including one on 16 May 2023 in which Ukraine said it had intercepted six Kinzhal missiles.\nDeliberately depriving Ukrainians of electricity and heating during the cold winter months was the biggest attack on a nation's health since World War II. The attacks on power stations inflicted large economic and practical costs on Ukraine. The UK Defense Ministry said the strikes were intended to demoralize the population and force the Ukrainian leadership to capitulate. This is widely deemed to have failed. \nThe strikes were condemned internationally, with the European Commission describing them as \"barbaric\" and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg calling them \"horrific and indiscriminate\". President Zelenskyy described the strikes as \"absolute evil\" and \"terrorism\". The International Criminal Court (ICC) indicted four Russian officials for war crimes connected with attacks against civilian infrastructure, including former Minister of Defence Sergei Shoigu and Head of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation Valery Gerasimov.","content":"#Background\n#Timeline\n##September 2022\n##October 2022\n###10 October\n###11–31 October\n##November 2022\n##December 2022\n##January 2023\n##February 2023\n##March 2023\n##April 2023\n##May 2023\n##June 2023\n##July 2023\n##September 2023\n##October 2023\n##December 2023\n##January 2024\n##April 2024\n##June–August 2024\n#Spillover\n##Moldova\n##Poland\n##Romania\n##Belarus\n#Reactions\n##International organizations\n###United Nations\n###European Union\n###NATO\n##Individual states\n###United States\n###United Kingdom\n###Ukraine\n###Russia\n###Others\n#Remedial actions\n##United Nations\n##European Parliament\n##Turkish floating powerships\n##Light bulb appeal\n##Resilience improvements\n##Funding\n#International Criminal Court indictments\n#See also\n","lang":"en"}

In November 2022, Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed Jack Smith to lead a special counsel investigation encompassing the investigations into attempts to overturn the election and Trump's handling of government documents.\nOn August 1, 2023, a grand jury indicted Trump in the District of Columbia U.S. District Court on four charges for his conduct following the 2020 presidential election through the January 6 Capitol attack: conspiracy to defraud the United States under Title 18 of the United States Code, obstructing an official proceeding and conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding under the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002, and conspiracy against rights under the Enforcement Act of 1870. The indictment mentioned six unnamed co-conspirators. It is Trump's third indictment and the first indictment against a U.S. president concerning actions while in office. Trump appeared at an arraignment on August 3, where he pleaded not guilty. The charge with the longest sentence carries a maximum of 20 years in prison.\nOn February 2, 2024, Judge Tanya Chutkan said she would not schedule a trial until the DC Circuit Court of Appeals decided whether Trump was immune from prosecution. After that court unanimously ruled that Trump was not immune, Trump appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled on July 1 that former presidents have \"some immunity from criminal prosecution\" for their \"official acts\" made during their presidency. As a result, on August 27, the special counsel issued a superseding indictment that maintained the same four charges but omitted some specific allegations.","content":"#Background\n##Accusations of electoral fraud and attempts to overturn the election\n##January 6 Capitol attack and investigations\n#Original indictment and arraignment\n#Superseding indictment and arraignment\n#Statements in the indictment\n##Allegations and statements\n##Count One: Conspiracy to defraud the United States\n##Further allegations and statements\n##Count Two: Conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding\n##Count Three: Obstruction of an official proceeding\n##Count Four: Conspiracy against rights\n#Co-conspirators\n#Pretrial proceedings\n##Initial timetable\n##Protective orders and security measures\n##Other pre-trial motions\n##Immunity dispute\n###Appeals\n###Proceedings resulting from the immunity decision\n##Post-immunity timetable\n#Potential witnesses and evidence\n##Prosecution\n##Defense\n#Reactions\n##Defendant\n##Republicans in support of the indictment\n##Republicans opposed to the indictment\n##Democrats in support of the indictment\n#See also\n#References\n##Footnotes\n##Citations\n##Works cited\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Twitter","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Twitter","summary":"Twitter, officially known as X since July 2023, is a social networking service. It is one of the world's largest social media websites and one of the most-visited websites. Users can share short text messages, images, and videos in short posts commonly known as \"tweets\" or \"retweets\" (officially \"post\" or \"repost\") and like other users' content. The platform also includes direct messaging, video and audio calling, bookmarks, lists, communities, a chatbot (Grok), job search and Spaces, a social audio feature. Users can vote on context added by approved users using the Community Notes feature.\nTwitter was created in March 2006 by Jack Dorsey, Noah Glass, Biz Stone, and Evan Williams, and was launched in July of that year. Twitter grew quickly; by 2012 more than 100 million users produced 340 million tweets per day. Twitter, Inc., was based in San Francisco, California, and had more than 25 offices around the world. A signature characteristic of the service initially was that posts were required to be brief. Posts were initially limited to 140 characters, which was changed to 280 characters in 2017. The limitation was removed for subscribed accounts in 2023. The majority of tweets are produced by a minority of users. In 2020, it was estimated that approximately 48 million accounts (15% of all accounts) were run by internet bots rather than humans.\nThe service is owned by the American company X Corp., which was established to succeed the prior owner Twitter, Inc. in March 2023 following the October 2022 acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk for US$44 billion. Musk stated that his goal with the acquisition was to promote free speech on the platform. Since his acquisition, the platform has been criticized for enabling the increased spread of disinformation and hate speech. Linda Yaccarino succeeded Musk as CEO on June 5, 2023, with Musk remaining as the chairman and the chief technology officer. In July 2023, Musk announced that Twitter would be rebranded to \"X\" and the bird logo would be retired, a process which was completed by May 2024. In December 2023, Fidelity estimated the value of the company to be down 71.5% from its purchase price. Since Musk's takeover, data from app-tracking firms has shown that global usage of Twitter has declined by approximately 15%, compared to a decline of 5–10% in some other social media sites. The platform has disputed that usage has dropped at all, with Musk claiming that membership had grown to 600 million users as of a May 2024 tweet. By October 2024, the platform was estimated to have lost about 80 percent of its value since Musk acquired it.","content":"#History\n##2006–2007: Creation and initial reaction\n##2007–2010\n##2010–2014\n##2014–2020\n##2020–2022\n##2022–present: Transition to X\n#Appearance and features\n##Tweets\n##Multimedia content\n##Curation\n###Trending topics\n###Lists\n###Moments\n##Algorithm\n##Mobile\n##X Premium\n###Verification of paid accounts\n##User monetization\n##E-commerce\n#Usage\n##Demographics\n##Content\n##Levels of use\n##User engagement\n#Branding\n#Logo evolution\n#Finances\n##Revenue sources\n##Advertising bans\n##Fines\n#Technology\n##Implementation\n##API and developer platform\n##Innovators patent agreement\n##Open source\n##Interface\n##Security\n##Outages\n#User accounts\n##Verified accounts\n##Privacy\n##Harassment\n##Suspect and contested accounts\n##Malicious and fake accounts\n##Bot accounts\n#Society\n##Usage\n###Protesters\n###Governments\n###Pornographic content\n###Child sexual exploitation\n##Impact\n###On communication\n###Emergency use\n###Education\n###Public figures\n###World leaders\n###Religion\n##Censorship and moderation\n###Moderation of tweets\n##Community Notes\n##Court cases, lawsuits, and adjudication\n#Statistics\n##User accounts with large follower base\n##Record tweets\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

The officers, all members of the Memphis Police Department (MPD) SCORPION unit, pulled Nichols from his car before pepper spraying and tasering him. Nichols broke free and ran toward his mother's house, which was less than a mile (1.6 km) away. The officers caught up with Nichols near the house, where they punched, kicked and pepper sprayed him, and struck him with a baton. Medics on the scene failed to administer care for 16 minutes after arriving. Nichols was admitted to the hospital in critical condition.\nThe officers reported that they stopped Nichols for reckless driving. The MPD released four edited video clips from police body cameras and a nearby pole-mounted camera. MPD Police Chief Cerelyn J. Davis later stated that the department had reviewed camera footage and could not find any evidence of probable cause for the traffic stop.\nThe Tennessee Bureau of Investigation and the United States Department of Justice both opened investigations into the incident. The autopsy determined the cause of death as blunt force trauma to the head, and the manner of death as homicide.\nThe five officers who assaulted Nichols were discharged from the MPD, effective January 8, 2023. They were arrested and charged on January 26 with second-degree murder, aggravated kidnapping, aggravated assault, official misconduct, and official oppression. Three of the officers have pleaded not guilty to the charges. One officer, Desmond Mills Jr., pleaded guilty to federal charges of deprivation of rights and conspiracy and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors on November 2, 2023. Another officer, Emmett Martin III, who initially pleaded not guilty, changed his plea to guilty on August 23, 2024. The MPD has disciplined, relieved of duty, dismissed, or arrested thirteen officers regarding their conduct. Memphis Fire Services terminated three employees for their failure to evaluate or assist Nichols. After the release of the videos, widespread protests began on January 27.\nThe five officers involved were also charged with civil rights violations by federal authorities in connection with the killing. One of them later pleaded guilty to these charges. He later agreed to plead guilty to all state charges, including murder. A second officer pleaded guilty in August 2024. On October 3, 2024, Haley was convicted of all four counts he was charged with, including civil rights deprivation related charges, while Bean and Smith would each be convicted of one lesser count related to witness tampering.","content":"#People involved\n##Tyre Nichols\n##Police officers\n###DeWayne Smith\n##SCORPION Unit\n#Traffic stop and death\n#Investigations\n##Police report\n##Autopsy\n##Dismissals and criminal charges\n###Grand jury indictments\n###Court hearings\n###Federal charges\n#Aftermath\n##Protests\n##Reactions\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

It was 19 feet 3 inches (5.87 m) tall and made from six granite slabs weighing a total of 237,746 pounds (107,840 kg). The structure was sometimes referred to as an \"American Stonehenge\". The monument's creators believed that there was going to be an upcoming social, nuclear, or economic calamity and they wanted the monument to serve as a guide for humanity in the world which would exist after it. Controversial from its time of construction, it ultimately became the subject of conspiracy theories which alleged that it was connected to Satanism.\nOn the morning of July 6, 2022, the guidestones were heavily damaged in a bombing from a vandal, and the debris and guidestones were removed by the local government later that day. In late July, Elberton Mayor Daniel Graves announced plans to rebuild the monument. In August, the Elbert County Board of Commissioners voted to donate the remains of the monument to the Elberton Granite Association, and return the 5 acres (2 ha) of land on which the monument was erected to its previous owner.","content":"#History\n##Construction\n##Reaction\n##Destruction\n###Aftermath\n#Description\n##Inscriptions\n##Explanatory tablet\n##Physical data\n##Guidestone languages\n##Astronomical features\n#Interpretations\n##Conspiracy theories\n#See also\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

Ten people, all of whom were African Americans, were murdered and three were injured. The shooter, identified as 18-year-old Payton S. Gendron, livestreamed part of the attack on Twitch, but the livestream was shut down by the service in under two minutes. Gendron was taken into custody and charged with first-degree murder. He formally entered a plea of \"not guilty\" on May 19, 2022. On November 28, 2022, Gendron pleaded guilty to all state charges in the shooting, including murder, domestic terrorism, and hate crimes. On February 15, 2023, Gendron was sentenced to 11 concurrent life sentences without the possibility of parole; as of that date, federal charges are still ongoing, and the federal prosecution also expressed their intention to seek the death penalty.\nGendron is reported to have written a manifesto describing himself as an ethno-nationalist and a supporter of white supremacy who is motivated to commit acts of political violence. He voiced support for the far-right \"Great Replacement\" conspiracy theory in the context of a \"white genocide\". The attack has been described as an act of domestic terrorism, and it is also being investigated as a hate crime which was motivated by racism. Governor Kathy Hochul promised policy changes in the state as a result of the attack while condemning the shooter; shortly afterwards, New York state banned most semi-automatic sales to people under 21 and certain types of body armor. Around March 19, 2024, a New York state judge ruled Reddit and YouTube must face lawsuits in connection with the mass shooting over accusations that they played a role in the radicalization of the shooter.","content":"#Shooting\n#Victims\n#Immediate aftermath\n#Investigation\n#Perpetrator\n##Investigation of previous threat\n##Weapons\n##Manifesto\n##Activity on chat logs & online diary\n#Legal proceedings\n##Criminal charges\n##State\n##Federal\n#Reactions\n##National\n##Twitch response\n##Usage of Gendron's rhetoric by others\n##Legislative\n##Local\n##International\n#Legacy\n#See also\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Land","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Land","summary":"Land, also known as dry land, ground, or earth, is the solid terrestrial surface of Earth not submerged by the ocean or another body of water. It makes up 29.2% of Earth's surface and includes all continents and islands. Earth's land surface is almost entirely covered by regolith, a layer of rock, soil, and minerals that forms the outer part of the crust. Land plays an important role in Earth's climate system, being involved in the carbon cycle, nitrogen cycle, and water cycle. One-third of land is covered in trees, another third is used for agriculture, and one-tenth is covered in permanent snow and glaciers. The remainder consists of desert, savannah, and prairie.\nLand terrain varies greatly, consisting of mountains, deserts, plains, plateaus, glaciers, and other landforms. In physical geology, the land is divided into two major categories: Mountain ranges and relatively flat interiors called cratons. Both form over millions of years through plate tectonics. Streams – a major part of Earth's water cycle – shape the landscape, carve rocks, transport sediments, and replenish groundwater. At high elevations or latitudes, snow is compacted and recrystallized over hundreds or thousands of years to form glaciers, which can be so heavy that they warp the Earth's crust. About 30 percent of land has a dry climate, due to losing more water through evaporation than it gains from precipitation. Since warm air rises, this generates winds, though Earth's rotation and uneven sun distribution also play a part.\nLand is commonly defined as the solid, dry surface of Earth. It can also refer to the collective natural resources that the land holds, including rivers, lakes, and the biosphere. Human manipulation of the land, including agriculture and architecture, can also be considered part of land. Land is formed from the continental crust, the layer of rock on which soil. groundwater, and human and animal activity sits.\nThough modern terrestrial plants and animals evolved from aquatic creatures, Earth's first cellular life likely originated on land. Survival on land relies on fresh water from rivers, streams, lakes, and glaciers, which constitute only three percent of the water on Earth. The vast majority of human activity throughout history has occurred in habitable land areas supporting agriculture and various natural resources. In recent decades, scientists and policymakers have emphasized the need to manage land and its biosphere more sustainably, through measures such as restoring degraded soil, preserving biodiversity, protecting endangered species, and addressing climate change.","content":"#Definition\n#Etymology\n#Physical science\n##Formation\n##Landmasses\n##Terrain\n##Geomorphology\n##Climate\n#Features\n##Coasts and islands\n##Mountains and plateaus\n##Plains and valleys\n##Caves and craters\n#Layers\n##Land cover\n##Soil\n##Continental crust\n#Life science\n##Land biomes\n##Fauna and flora\n#Humans and land\n##Culture\n##Travel\n##Trade\n##Land use\n##Law\n##Geopolitics\n#Environmental issues\n##Soil degradation\n##Pollution\n##Biodiversity loss\n##Resource depletion\n#Gallery\n#See also\n#Notes\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"History_of_the_telephone_in_the_United_States","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/History_of_the_telephone_in_the_United_States","summary":"The telephone played a major communications role in American history from the 1876 publication of its first patent by Alexander Graham Bell onward. In the 20th century the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T) dominated the telecommunication market as the at times largest company in the world, until it was broken up and replaced by a system of competitors. Originally targeted at business users and upscale families, by the 1920s the \"phone\" became widely popular in the general population. Ordinary people either subscribed to telephone service themselves, or used a telephone in the neighborhood, including public pay telephones. Long-distance service was metered and much more expensive than local, flat-rate calling. Ordinary Americans contacted businesses, friends, and relatives. Business-to-business communication was important, and increasingly displaced telegrams.\nThe technology steadily advanced. Starting around the turn of the century, the dial telephone allowed users to place calls themselves without operator assistance. By mid-century, mobile radio telephone service became available to free users from fixed locations in some cities. The arrival of the smartphone in the early 21st century provided every user a small mobile computer with microphone and speaker, that was bundled with powerful features, such as cameras and Internet access by operation of apps. It could easily send text messages, which tended to displace voice calls.\nIn 1890 1% of U.S. households owned at least one telephone while a majority did by 1946 and 75 percent did by 1957. In 2002, a majority of U.S. survey respondents reported having a mobile phone. In January 2013, a majority of U.S. survey respondents reported owning a smartphone.","content":"#AT&T and the Bell System\n##American Bell Telephone Company (1881–1899)\n##AT&T (1899–1982)\n##Research priority\n##Targeting an audience\n###Urban public telephones\n###Rural telephone service\n##Breakup of AT&T in 1982\n#Cellphones and smartphones\n#Personnel\n##Switchboard and operators\n##Labor force: bias for and against women\n###Strikes\n##Hawthorne studies\n##Employee benefits\n#Users\n##Business\n##Housewives\n##Gender and culture roles\n##Telemarketing\n##9-1-1\n##Harassing calls\n##Literary fears\n#See also\n#References\n#Further reading\n##Social and cultural studies\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Darjeeling","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Darjeeling","summary":"Darjeeling (, Bengali: [ˈdarˌdʒiliŋ], Nepali: [ˈdard͡ziliŋ]) is a city in the northernmost region of the Indian state of West Bengal. Located in the Eastern Himalayas, it has an average elevation of 2,045 metres (6,709 ft). To the west of Darjeeling lies the easternmost province of Nepal, to the east the Kingdom of Bhutan, to the north the Indian state of Sikkim, and farther north the Tibet Autonomous Region region of China. Bangladesh lies to the south and southeast, and most of the state of West Bengal lies to the south and southwest, connected to the Darjeeling region by a narrow tract. Kangchenjunga, the world's third-highest mountain, rises to the north and is prominently visible on clear days.\nIn the early 19th century, during East India Company rule in India, Darjeeling was identified as a potential summer retreat for British officials, soldiers and their families. The narrow mountain ridge was leased from the Kingdom of Sikkim, and eventually annexed to British India. Experimentation with growing tea on the slopes below Darjeeling was highly successful. Thousands of labourers were recruited chiefly from Nepal to clear the forests, build European-style cottages and work in the tea plantations. The widespread deforestation displaced the indigenous peoples. Residential schools were established in and around Darjeeling for the education of children of the domiciled British in India. By the late-19th century, a novel narrow-gauge mountain railway, the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, was bringing summer residents into the town and carrying a freight of tea out for export to the world. After India's independence in 1947, as the British left Darjeeling, its cottages were purchased by wealthy Indians from the plains and its tea plantations by out-of-town Indian business owners and conglomerates.\nDarjeeling's population today is constituted largely of the descendants of the indigenous and immigrant labourers that were employed in the original development of the town. Although their common language, the Nepali language, has been given official recognition at the state and federal levels in India, the recognition has created little meaningful employment for the language's speakers nor has it increased their ability to have a significantly greater say in their political affairs. The tea industry and tourism are the mainstays of the town's economy. Deforestation in the region after India's independence has caused environmental damage, affecting the perennial springs that supply the town's water. The population of Darjeeling meanwhile has exploded over the years, and unregulated construction, traffic congestion and water shortages are common. Many young locals, educated in government schools, have taken to migrating out for the lack of jobs matching their skills. Like out-migrants from other regions of northeastern India, they have been subjected to discrimination and racism in some Indian cities.\nDarjeeling's culture is highly cosmopolitan—a result of diverse ethnic groups intermixing and evolving away from their historical roots. The region's indigenous cuisine is rich in fermented foods and beverages. Tourists have flocked to Darjeeling since the mid-19th century. In 1999, after an international campaign for its support, the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. In 2005, Darjeeling tea was given geographical indication by the World Trade Organization as much for the protection of the brand as for the development of the region that produces it.","content":"#Toponymy\n#History\n##1780 to 1835\n##1835–1857: East India Company rule\n##1858–1947: British Raj\n##1947 onwards: independent India\n#Geography and geology\n#Climate and environment\n##Climate\n##Environment\n#Flora and fauna\n#Demographics\n#Governance\n#Economy\n##Tea\n##Tourism\n#Utilities\n#Transport\n#Culture\n##Food\n#Education\n#Explanatory notes\n#References\n##Citations\n##General and cited references\n###Books\n###Journals\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

It revolves around Arjun, a police officer, who is assigned to track down a group of outlaw bikers following their involvement in heinous crimes.\nThis film marked the second collaboration between Ajith, Vinoth and Kapoor after Nerkonda Paarvai (2019). Vinoth wrote the script in mid-2018, but Ajith initially declined it and asked him to work on it later. The idea was later pitched in January 2019 with Kapoor agreeing to fund the project and was officially launched in mid-October 2019, with its title. Principal photography began in December 2019 in Hyderabad and was completed in February 2021, irrespective of production being disrupted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Major portions of the film were shot across Chennai and Hyderabad, in addition to a few sequences in Russia, which were filmed during late-August and early-September 2021.\nThe film was in the news for a long time, due to the persuasion of fans to launch an update regarding the project, leading to a campaign named #ValimaiUpdate, that influenced sports, politics and other events as well. It eventually led to being listed as one of the most-anticipated Tamil films according to trade circuits. After being delayed multiple times, due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic restrictions being enforced in India, the film was released worldwide on 24 February 2022 to mixed reviews from critics.","content":"#Plot\n#Cast\n#Production\n##Development\n##Casting\n##Filming\n##Post-production\n#Music\n#Marketing\n#Release\n##Theatrical\n##Screenings and statistics\n##Pre-release business\n##Distribution\n##Home media\n#Reception\n##Critical response\n##Box office\n#Plagiarism allegations\n#Impact\n#Potential sequel\n#References\n#Notes\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

At the peak of his net worth, he was ranked the 41st-richest American in the Forbes 400.\nThe friendly \"math nerd\" persona of Bankman-Fried masked significant problems at FTX, and in November 2022, as evidence of potential fraud began to surface, depositors quickly withdrew their assets, forcing the company into bankruptcy. On December 12, 2022, Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas and extradited to the United States, where he was indicted on seven criminal charges, including wire fraud, commodities fraud, securities fraud, money laundering, and campaign finance law violations.\nIn the case of United States v.

The 84th annual edition of the tournament began on March 14, 2023, and concluded with the UConn Huskies defeating the San Diego State Aztecs, 76–59 in the championship game on April 3 at NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas.\nASUN champion Kennesaw State made its NCAA tournament debut, while Southern Conference champion Furman made its first NCAA appearance since 1980. Another school, Texas Southern, won the SWAC tournament to become the third 20-loss team to make the field, after the Coppin State Eagles in 2008 and Liberty Flames in 2013. It was also Texas Southern's 3rd consecutive NCAA tournament.\nThis tournament featured several notable upsets. For only the second time in history, a 16-seed defeated a 1-seed, when Fairleigh Dickinson upset Purdue in the first round 63–58 in Columbus. Coincidentally, much like the previous time a top seed lost in Round 1, the regional final was contested between a mid-major (in this case Florida Atlantic) and Kansas State. For the third consecutive year, and seventh time since 2012, a 15-seed defeated a 2-seed in the tournament, when 15-seeded Princeton defeated 2-seed Arizona 59–55 in Sacramento for the Tigers' first tournament win since 1998. Arizona became the first team to lose to a 15-seed team twice, with the first loss being against the Santa Clara Broncos in 1993. Additionally, Princeton subsequently defeated Missouri in the second round to advance to the Sweet 16, marking the third consecutive year where a 15-seed reach the regional semifinals. It was also the 15th consecutive tournament since 2007 where a double-digit seed made the regional semifinals. Additionally, Virginia was knocked out in the first round as a top-four seed for the second consecutive year, and the third time in five years as a 4-seed when they were upset by 13-seed Furman.\nThe defending national champions Kansas Jayhawks were eliminated in the second round, against the Arkansas Razorbacks, becoming the sixth consecutive tournament where the defending champion failed to make the Sweet Sixteen.\nThis was also the first NCAA tournament in which all of the top seeds failed to make the Elite Eight, after Alabama and Houston's eliminations in the Sweet Sixteen. This year also had the fewest combined 1- and 2-seeds left in the Elite Eight in tournament history, with only 2-seed Texas remaining.\nFor the first time since 1970, three teams made their first Final Four appearance in this tournament. Those three teams were Florida Atlantic, who defeated 3-seed Kansas State to join Wichita State as the only 9-seeds to advance to the Final Four since the tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985, San Diego State, and Miami (FL), who both advanced to their first Final Four in program history. FAU also became the first team since George Mason in 2006 to make the Final Four in the same season that it earned its first NCAA tournament win. This is also the third Final Four without any 1-seeds since the tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985, with the first two being in 2006 and 2011, the second time without any 1 or 2 seeds (2011), and the first time in Final Four history without any teams seeded 1–3. With FAU (Conference USA) and SDSU (Mountain West Conference), the Final Four had two mid-major teams for the first time since 2011's Butler and VCU.\nThe 2023 Final Four was also marked by its lack of highly touted high school prospects. For the first time since the NCAA began seeding the tournament in 1979, no former McDonald's All-American participated in the Final Four. Of the rotation players on the Final Four teams (those receiving regular playing time), the highest-ranked in the composite recruiting rankings of 247Sports was UConn's Jordan Hawkins, who was #51 in the 2021 class. Only eight rotation players in the Final Four were even ranked in the top 100; by contrast, 12 players were unranked in high school. Two teams, Florida Atlantic and San Diego State, had no top-100 players, with FAU's nine-man rotation featuring six unranked players and only one in the top 200.\nFor the second consecutive year, a school that won a conference championship was ineligible to compete in the NCAA tournament because they were in transition to Division I.","content":"#Procedures\n#Schedule and venues\n#Qualification and selection of teams\n##Automatic qualifiers\n##Seeds\n#Bracket\n##First Four – Dayton, OH\n##South regional – KFC Yum!

Charles acceded to the throne on 8 September 2022 upon the death of his mother, Elizabeth II. It was the first coronation held since Elizabeth II's coronation in 1953 nearly 70 years prior.\nThe ceremony was structured around an Anglican service of Holy Communion. It included Charles taking an oath, being anointed with holy oil, and receiving the coronation regalia, emphasising his spiritual role and secular responsibilities. Representatives of the Church of England and the British royal family declared their allegiance to him, and people throughout the Commonwealth realms were invited to do so. Camilla was crowned in a shorter and simpler ceremony. After the service, members of the royal family travelled to Buckingham Palace in a state procession and appeared on the palace's rear and front balconies. The service was altered from past British coronations to represent the multiple faiths, cultures, and communities of the United Kingdom. It was shorter than Elizabeth II's coronation, and had a peak UK television audience of 20.4 million, making it the most watched television broadcast of 2023.\nThe coronation elicited both celebrations and protest in the United Kingdom, with surveys carried out before the event suggesting that the British public was ambivalent towards the ceremony and its funding by taxpayers. The events in London and Windsor drew large crowds, but were also protested against by republican groups; 64 individuals were arrested on the day, which was criticised by the international advocacy group Human Rights Watch. The celebrations included street parties, volunteering, special commemorative church services, and a concert at Windsor Castle on 7 May. The response in the other Commonwealth realms was similarly mixed; while there were many celebrations, some government officials and indigenous groups took the opportunity to voice republican sentiments and call for reparatory justice. It was the first British coronation in the 21st century and the 40th to be held at Westminster Abbey since the coronation of William the Conqueror in 1066.","content":"#Preparation\n##Background\n##Service and procession\n##Guests\n##Vestments and crowns\n##Art\n##Music\n##Cost\n#Coronation service\n##Procession to the abbey\n##Procession into the abbey\n##Recognition\n##Oath and accession declaration\n##Anointing\n##Investment and crowning\n##Enthronement and homage\n##Coronation of the Queen\n##Holy Communion\n##End of the service\n##State procession to Buckingham Palace\n##Balcony appearances\n#Public events and commemorations\n##United Kingdom\n###Ecclesiastical initiatives\n###Government initiatives\n###Memorabilia\n###Crown Dependencies\n###British Overseas Territories\n##Canada\n###Emblem and commemorative items\n###Federal initiatives\n###Provincial initiatives\n##Australia\n##New Zealand\n##Papua New Guinea\n##Solomon Islands\n##Antigua and Barbuda\n##Vanuatu\n#Coverage and ratings\n#Reactions\n##Public opinion\n###Post-coronation\n##Protests\n###Security arrangements\n###Arrests\n##Reparatory demands\n##Republicanism\n##Reaction from international leaders\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

In its current form, the program is typically broadcast from the campus of the team hosting a featured game being played that day and features news and analysis of the day's upcoming games.\nIt first aired in 1987 with Tim Brando as host and Lee Corso and Beano Cook as commentators, giving an overview of college football games. Karie Ross soon became the first female to join the broadcast. The show underwent a radical transformation beginning in 1993, and began incorporating live broadcasts. Today, the only original cast member remaining is Lee Corso, whose appearances have been pre-scripted since suffering a stroke in 2009. Rece Davis serves as host and Kirk Herbstreit is Corso's counterpart. Desmond Howard was added to the cast of the show in 2008. Craig James served as an analyst from 1990 to 1995. Erin Andrews joined the GameDay crew as a co-host and contributor in 2010, replaced in 2012 by Samantha Ponder (and in 2017 by Maria Taylor after Ponder left to become host of Sunday NFL Countdown that same year). In 2015, Rece Davis (also host of the college basketball version of GameDay) replaced Chris Fowler as host of the show. In 2022, Pat McAfee joined, having previously been an analyst, and Nick Saban was added to the show in 2024. In 2010, the program started airing from 10:00am to 11:00am, with the opening hour broadcast on ESPNU until present day.\nThe show is known for its prediction segment that appears at the end of each broadcast. The predictions use the standard scoring system and do not use the spread in determining the pick.  Typically there are six predictors: Corso, Herbstreit, Howard, Saban, Pat McAfee, and an invited guest, usually a celebrity, prominent athlete, or radio personality associated with the host school for that week. The show always concludes with Corso's prediction for the host school's game, after which he dons the mascot's headgear of the team he predicts to win the game, usually to the ire or excitement of local fans. As of October 26, 2024, Corso is 280–140 in his headgear picks. His first headgear pick occurred on October 5, 1996, when he correctly picked the Ohio State Buckeyes over the Penn State Nittany Lions. In 2018, Corso made his first NFL headgear pick when, as a guest on Sunday NFL Countdown, he correctly picked the New Orleans Saints to win their Week 9 game at home against the Los Angeles Rams.  Corso made his 400th headgear pick on September 16, 2023, for the Colorado\/Colorado State rivalry game, he put on the headgear for Colorado.\nAs of October 26, 2024, Ohio State – Penn State and Alabama – LSU is the most featured matchup, appearing 12 times on College Gameday. Alabama – Georgia has been featured 11 times. Florida – Tennessee, Michigan – Ohio State and Army – Navy have been featured 9 times.

All 350 seats in the Congress of Deputies were up for election, as well as 208 of 265 seats in the Senate.\nThe second government of Pedro Sánchez formed after the November 2019 Spanish general election consisted of a left-wing coalition between the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) and Unidas Podemos, the country's first such nationwide government since the times of the Second Spanish Republic. The government's tenure was quickly overshadowed by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, along with its political and economic consequences. These consequences included the COVID-19 recession resulting from the extensive COVID-19 lockdowns implemented to curb the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, as well as the economic impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\nOn the right side of the political spectrum, the People's Party (PP) underwent a leadership change at the 20th National Congress of the PP in February 2022, following an internal push by Galician and Madrilenian presidents, Alberto Núñez Feijóo and Isabel Díaz Ayuso, to remove party leader Pablo Casado. Since Feijóo's accession, the PP led opinion polls and finished first in the regional and local elections of 28 May 2023. Far-right Vox has been open to support the PP in a hung parliament in exchange for government participation and programmatic concessions. The liberal Citizens party, once a leading force but having lost most of its support since 2019, decided not to run in this election, focusing its efforts on the 2024 European Parliament election instead.\nDespite speculation about an early election, Pedro Sánchez, the incumbent prime minister of Spain, consistently expressed his intention to complete the legislature as scheduled in 2023. He had initially set a tentative election date for December 2023, near the conclusion of the Spanish presidency of the Council of the European Union. The poor results of the left-wing bloc in the May 2023 regional and local elections, with losses to the PP and Vox in all but three regions, led to a surprise early dissolution of parliament in what was described as a gamble by Sánchez to wrong-foot the opposition.\nIn the closest election since 1996, the PP saw the biggest increase in support and secured 137 seats in the Congress, but fell short of expectations which had placed it at around 150 to 160 seats. The PSOE placed second and overperformed polls by improving upon previous results, gaining over 1 million votes and scoring its best result since 2008 in terms of votes and vote share. Vox saw a decrease in its popular vote and seats, while Sumar won 31 seats in the Congress, a decrease in the popular vote and seats of its constituent parties. Neither bloc achieved a majority and, despite losses among Catalan independence parties, the balance of power was held by the Together for Catalonia (Junts) party of former Catalan president and fugitive Carles Puigdemont. Following a failed attempt by Feijóo to secure investiture, Sánchez struck a deal with Junts and most of the parliamentary regionalist and peripheral nationalist parties, going on to win re-election in the first ballot of investiture scheduled on 16 November with an absolute majority of 179 votes in favour.","content":"#Overview\n##Electoral system\n##Election date\n#Parliamentary composition\n#Parties and candidates\n#Timetable\n#Campaign\n##Issues\n##Party slogans\n##Election debates\n#Opinion polls\n##Polling aggregations\n#Voter turnout\n#Results\n##Congress of Deputies\n##Senate\n##Elected members\n#Aftermath\n##Government formation\n#Notes\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Elon_Musk","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Elon_Musk","summary":"Elon Reeve Musk  (; born June 28, 1971) is a businessman and investor known for his key roles in the space company SpaceX and the automotive company Tesla, Inc. Other involvements include ownership of X Corp., the company that operates the social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), and his role in the founding of the Boring Company, xAI, Neuralink, and OpenAI. He is one of the wealthiest individuals in the world; as of August 2024 Forbes estimates his net worth to be US$247 billion.\nMusk was born in Pretoria, South Africa, to Maye (née Haldeman), a model, and Errol Musk, a businessman and engineer. Musk briefly attended the University of Pretoria before immigrating to Canada at the age of 18, acquiring citizenship through his Canadian-born mother. Two years later he matriculated at Queen's University at Kingston in Canada. Musk later transferred to the University of Pennsylvania and received bachelor's degrees in economics and physics. He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University, but dropped out after two days and, with his brother Kimbal, co-founded the online city guide software company Zip2. The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999. That same year Musk co-founded X.com, a direct bank. X.com merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal. In 2002 Musk acquired US citizenship. That October  eBay acquired PayPal for $1.5 billion. Using $100 million of the money he made from the sale of PayPal, Musk founded SpaceX, a spaceflight services company, in 2002. \nIn 2004, Musk was an early investor who provided most of the initial financing in the electric-vehicle manufacturer Tesla Motors, Inc. (later Tesla, Inc.), assuming the position of the company's chairman. He later became the product architect and, in 2008, the CEO. In 2006, Musk helped create SolarCity, a solar energy company that was acquired by Tesla in 2016 and became Tesla Energy. In 2013, he proposed a hyperloop high-speed vactrain transportation system. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit artificial intelligence research company. The following year Musk co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology company developing brain–computer interfaces, and The Boring Company, a tunnel construction company. In 2018 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Musk, alleging that he had falsely announced that he had secured funding for a private takeover of Tesla. To settle the case Musk stepped down as the chairman of Tesla and paid a $20 million fine. In 2022, he acquired Twitter for $44 billion, merged the company into the newly-created X Corp. and rebranded the service as X the following year. In March 2023, Musk founded xAI, an artificial-intelligence company.\nMusk's actions and expressed views have made him a polarizing figure. He has been criticized for making unscientific and misleading statements, including COVID-19 misinformation, promoting right-wing conspiracy theories, and \"endorsing an antisemitic theory\"; he later apologized for the last of these. His ownership of Twitter has been controversial because of the layoffs of large numbers of employees, an increase in hate speech, misinformation and disinformation posts on the website, and changes to website features, including X Premium verification. Musk has been active in American politics as a vocal and financial supporter of Donald Trump.","content":"#Early life and education\n##Childhood and family\n##Education\n#Business career\n##Zip2\n##X.com and PayPal\n##SpaceX\n###Starlink\n##Tesla\n###SEC and shareholder lawsuits regarding tweets\n###SolarCity and Tesla Energy\n##Neuralink\n##The Boring Company\n##Twitter \/ X\n##Leadership style\n#Other activities\n##Musk Foundation\n##Hyperloop\n##OpenAI and xAI\n##Tham Luang cave rescue and defamation case\n##2018 cannabis incident\n##Music\n##Private jet\n##Company towns\n#Wealth\n#Personal actions, views, and social media usage\n##Finance\n##Technology\n##Existential threats\n##Politics\n###Conservative PAC activities\n###International politics\n##Accusations of antisemitism\n##COVID-19\n#Personal life\n##Relationships and children\n##Legal matters after 2020\n#Public perception\n#Notes and references\n##Notes\n##Citations\n#Works cited\n#Further reading\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine","summary":"On 24 February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine in a major escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian War, which started in 2014. The invasion, the largest conflict in Europe since World War II, has caused hundreds of thousands of military casualties and tens of thousands of Ukrainian civilian casualties. As of 2024, Russian troops occupy about 20% of Ukraine. From a population of 41 million, about 8 million Ukrainians had been internally displaced and more than 8.2 million had fled the country by April 2023, creating Europe's largest refugee crisis since World War II.\nIn late 2021, Russia massed troops near Ukraine's borders and issued demands including a ban on Ukraine ever joining the NATO military alliance. After repeatedly denying having plans to invade or attack Ukraine, on 24 February 2022, Russian president Vladimir Putin announced a \"special military operation\", stating that it was to support the Russian-backed breakaway republics of Donetsk and Luhansk, whose paramilitary forces had been fighting Ukraine in the Donbas conflict since 2014. Putin espoused irredentist views challenging Ukraine's legitimacy as a state, falsely claimed that Ukraine was governed by neo-Nazis persecuting the Russian minority, and said that Russia's goal was to \"demilitarise and denazify\" Ukraine. Russian air strikes and a ground invasion were launched on a northern front from Belarus towards the capital Kyiv, a southern front from Crimea, and an eastern front from the Donbas and towards Kharkiv. Ukraine enacted martial law, ordered a general mobilisation and severed diplomatic relations with Russia.\nRussian troops retreated from the northern front, including from the outskirts of Kyiv, by April 2022 after encountering logistical challenges and stiff resistance. On the southern and southeastern fronts, Russia captured Kherson in March and Mariupol in May, the latter after a destructive siege. Russia launched a renewed offensive in the Donbas and continued to bomb military and civilian targets far from the front, including the energy grid through the winter months. In late 2022, Ukraine launched successful counteroffensives in the south and east. Soon after, Russia announced the illegal annexation of four partly occupied oblasts. In November, Ukraine retook parts of Kherson Oblast, including Kherson city. In June 2023, Ukraine launched another counteroffensive in the southeast, which by the end of the year had failed with only small amounts of territory retaken. After small but steady gains for Russia in eastern Ukraine in the first half of 2024, Ukraine launched a cross-border incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August of that year.\nWar-related disruption to Ukrainian agriculture and shipping contributed to a world food crisis, while extensive environmental damage caused by the conflict has been described as an ecocide. The Russian attacks on civilians have led to allegations of genocide. The invasion was met with widespread international condemnation. The United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution condemning the invasion and demanding a full Russian withdrawal in March 2022. The International Court of Justice ordered Russia to suspend military operations, and the Council of Europe expelled Russia. Many countries imposed sanctions on Russia and its ally Belarus, and provided humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine. The Baltic states and Poland all declared Russia a terrorist state. Protests occurred around the world, with anti-war protesters in Russia being met by mass arrests and greater media censorship. The International Criminal Court (ICC) opened an investigation into war crimes, crimes against humanity, abduction of Ukrainian children, and genocide against Ukrainians. The ICC issued six arrest warrants: for Putin and Maria Lvova-Belova, and for military officials Sergey Kobylash, Viktor Sokolov, Sergei Shoigu and Valery Gerasimov.","content":"#Background\n##Post-Soviet relations\n##Ukrainian revolution, Russian intervention in Crimea and Donbas\n#Prelude\n##Putin's invasion announcement\n#Events\n##Initial invasion (24 February – 7 April)\n###Kyiv and northern front\n###Northeastern front\n###Southern front\n###Eastern front\n##Southeastern front (8 April – 5 September)\n###Fall of Mariupol\n###Fall of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk\n###Kharkiv front\n###Kherson-Mykolaiv front\n###Zaporizhzhia front\n##Russian annexations and occupation losses (6 September – 11 November 2022)\n###Russian annexation of Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia oblasts\n###Zaporizhzhia front\n###Kherson counteroffensive\n###Kharkiv counteroffensive\n##Winter stalemate, attrition campaign and military surge (12 November 2022 – 7 June 2023)\n###Battle of Bakhmut\n##2023 counteroffensives and summer campaign (8 June 2023 – 1 December 2023)\n##Russian spring and summer campaigns and Ukrainian incursion (1 December 2023 – present)\n###Russian offensive\n###Ukrainian offensive and further Donbas advances\n#Battlespaces\n##Command\n##Missile attacks and aerial warfare\n###Crimea attacks\n###Russian attacks against Ukrainian civilian infrastructure\n##Naval blockade and engagements\n##Nuclear risk\n##Ukrainian resistance\n#International aspects\n##Reactions\n##Foreign involvement\n###Support for Ukraine\n###Support for Russia\n#Casualties\n#Prisoners of war\n#War crimes and attacks on civilians\n##Abduction of Ukrainian children\n##International arrest warrants\n#Impacts\n##Humanitarian impact\n##Refugee crisis\n##Long-term demographic effects\n##Environmental impact\n##Economic impact\n###Ukraine\n###Russia\n#Peace efforts\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

The film is dedicated to the memories of Spielberg's parents, Leah Adler and Arnold Spielberg, who died in 2017 and 2020, respectively.\nSpielberg had conceived the project as early as 1999, with his sister Anne writing a screenplay titled I'll Be Home. The project was withheld for 20 years, since Spielberg had reservations about exploring his family's story over concerns that his parents would be hurt. Spielberg revisited the project in 2019 with screenwriter and frequent collaborator Kushner while they were making West Side Story, and the screenplay was completed in late 2020. Development of the film officially began soon after, with casting taking place between March and May 2021. Principal photography began that July in Los Angeles and wrapped in September.\nThe Fabelmans premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 10, 2022, where it won the People's Choice Award. Distributed by Universal Pictures, the film opened as a limited theatrical release in the United States on November 11, 2022, and then expanded to a wide release on November 23, grossing $45.6 million against a $40 million budget. It received widespread critical acclaim and was named one of the top ten films of 2022 by the National Board of Review and the American Film Institute, and was considered a return to form for Spielberg. The Fabelmans earned numerous awards and nominations including seven nominations at the 95th Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress (Williams), and Best Supporting Actor (Hirsch). It also earned 11 nominations at the 28th Critics' Choice Awards, winning Best Young Performer (LaBelle), and five nominations at the 80th Golden Globe Awards, winning Best Motion Picture – Drama and Best Director. Since then, it has been cited as one of Spielberg's best films, and as one of the best films of the 2020s and the 21st century.","content":"#Plot\n#Cast\n#Production\n##Development\n##Writing\n##Pre-production\n##Casting\n##Filming\n##Production design\n##Visual effects\n#Music\n#Themes and interpretations\n#Release\n##Theatrical\n##Home media\n##Marketing\n#Reception\n##Box office\n##Critical response\n##Legacy\n##Accolades\n#Possible sequel\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"RRR","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/RRR","summary":"RRR (subtitled onscreen as Roudram Ranam Rudhiram) is a 2022 Indian Telugu-language historical action drama film directed by S.

It is a highly fictionalized tribute to two Indian revolutionaries, Alluri Sitarama Raju (Charan) and Komaram Bheem (Rama Rao), celebrating friendship and the struggle against oppression represented by the British Raj.\nRajamouli conceived the story by reimagining Rama Raju and Bheem meeting in 1920 Delhi as two unstoppable forces in an epic fight with colonial tyranny. The film was announced in March 2018. Principal photography of the film began in November 2018 in Hyderabad and continued until August 2021, owing to delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. It was filmed extensively across India, with a few sequences filmed in Ukraine and Bulgaria. The film's soundtrack and background score were composed by M. M. Keeravani, with cinematography by K. K. Senthil Kumar and editing by A. Sreekar Prasad. Sabu Cyril is the film's production designer while V. Srinivas Mohan supervised the visual effects.\nMade on a budget of ₹550 crore, RRR was the most expensive Indian film at the time of its release. The film was released theatrically on 25 March 2022. With ₹223 crore worldwide on its first day, RRR recorded the highest opening-day earned by an Indian film. It emerged as the highest-grossing film in its home market of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, grossing over ₹406 crore. The film grossed ₹1,300 crore worldwide, setting several box office records for an Indian film, including the third highest-grossing Indian film, the second highest-grossing Telugu film and the highest grossing Indian film of 2022 worldwide.\nRRR became a worldwide cultural phenomenon and received universal critical acclaim for its direction, screenwriting, cast performances, cinematography, soundtrack, action sequences and VFX. The film was considered one of the ten best films of the year by the National Board of Review, making it only the seventh non-English language film ever to make it to the list. The song \"Naatu Naatu\" won the Oscar for Best Original Song at the 95th Academy Awards, making it the first song from an Indian film, as well as the first from an Asian film, to win in this category.

{"title":"Leonardo_Torres_Quevedo","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Leonardo_Torres_Quevedo","summary":"Leonardo Torres Quevedo (Spanish: [leoˈnaɾðo ˈtores keˈβeðo]; 28 December 1852 – 18 December 1936) was a Spanish civil engineer, mathematician and inventor, known for his numerous engineering innovations, including aerial trams, airships, catamarans, and remote control. He was also a pioneer in the field of computing and robotics. Torres was a member of several scientific and cultural institutions and held such important positions as the seat N of the Real Academia Española (1920–1936) and the presidency of the Spanish Royal Academy of Sciences (1928–1934). In 1927 he became a foreign associate of the French Academy of Sciences.\nHis first groundbreaking invention was a cable car system patented in 1887 for the safe transportation of people, an activity that culminated in 1916 when the Whirlpool Aero Car was opened in Niagara Falls. In the 1890s, Torres focused his efforts on analog computation. He published Sur les machines algébriques (1895) and Machines à calculer (1901), technical studies that gave him recognition in France for his construction of machines to solve real and complex roots of polynomials. He made significant aeronautical contributions at the beginning of the 20th century, becoming the inventor of the non-rigid Astra-Torres airships, a trilobed structure that helped the British and French armies counter Germany's submarine warfare during World War I. These tasks in dirigible engineering led him to be a key figure in the development of radio control systems in 1901–05 with the Telekine, which he laid down modern wireless remote-control operation principles.\nFrom his Laboratory of Automation created in 1907, Torres invented one of his greatest technological achievements, El Ajedrecista (The Chess Player) of 1912, an electromagnetic device capable of playing a limited form of chess that demonstrated the capability of machines to be programmed to follow specified rules (heuristics) and marked the beginnings of research into the development of artificial intelligence. He advanced beyond the work of Charles Babbage in his 1914 paper Essays on Automatics, where he speculated about thinking machines and included the design of a special-purpose electromechanical calculator, introducing concepts still relevant like floating-point arithmetic. British historian Brian Randell called it \"a fascinating work which well repays reading even today\". Subsequently, Torres demonstrated the feasibility of an electromechanical analytical engine by successfully producing a typewriter-controlled calculating machine in 1920. \nHe conceived other original designs before his retirement in 1930, some of the most notable were in naval architecture projects, such as the Buque campamento (Camp-Vessel, 1913), a balloon carrier for transporting airships attached to a mooring mast of his creation, and the Binave (Twin Ship, 1916), a multihull steel vessel driven by two propellers powered by marine engines. In addition to his interests in engineering, Torres also stood out in the field of letters and was a prominent speaker and supporter of Esperanto.","content":"#Early life and education\n#Career\n##Cableways\n##Analogue calculating machines\n##Aerostatics\n##Radio control: the Telekino\n##Formal language\n##Laboratory of Automation\n##Chess automaton: El Ajedrecista\n##Essays on Automatics\n###Analytical machines\n##Naval projects\n##Other inventions and miscellaneous activities\n###Esperantist\n###Spanish-American Technological Dictionary\n#Distinctions\n#Personal life, religious beliefs and death\n#Legacy\n#In fiction\n#Selected works\n#See also\n#References\n##Notes\n##Bibliography\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Eiji_Tsuburaya","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Eiji_Tsuburaya","summary":"Eiji Tsuburaya (Japanese: 円谷 英二, Hepburn: Tsuburaya Eiji, July 7, 1901 – January 25, 1970) was a Japanese special effects director, filmmaker, and cinematographer. A co-creator of the Godzilla and Ultraman franchises, he is considered one of the most important and influential figures in the history of cinema. Tsuburaya is known as the \"Father of Tokusatsu\", having pioneered Japan's special effects industry and introduced several technological developments in film productions. In a career spanning five decades, Tsuburaya worked on approximately 250 films—including globally renowned features directed by Ishirō Honda, Hiroshi Inagaki, and Akira Kurosawa—and earned six Japan Technical Awards.\nFollowing a brief stint as an inventor, Tsuburaya was employed by Japanese cinema pioneer Yoshirō Edamasa in 1919 and began his career working as an assistant cinematographer on Edamasa's A Tune of Pity. Thereafter, he worked as an assistant cinematographer on several films, including Teinosuke Kinugasa's A Page of Madness (1926). At the age of thirty-two, Tsuburaya watched King Kong, which greatly influenced him to work in special effects. Tsuburaya completed the first iron shooting crane in October 1934, and an adaptation of the crane is still in use across the globe today. After filming his directorial debut on the cruiser Asama in the Pacific Ocean, he worked on Princess Kaguya (1935), one of Japan's first major films to incorporate special effects. His first majorly successful film in effects, The Daughter of the Samurai (1937), remarkably featured the first full-scale rear projection.\nIn 1937, Tsuburaya was employed by Toho and established the company's effects department. Tsuburaya directed the effects for The War at Sea from Hawaii to Malaya in 1942, which became the highest-grossing Japanese film in history upon its release. His elaborate effects were believed to be behind the film's major success, and he won an award for his work from the Japan Motion Picture Cinematographers Association. In 1948, however, Tsuburaya was purged from Toho by the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers because of his involvement in propaganda films during World War II. Thus, he founded Tsuburaya Special Technology Laboratory with his eldest son Hajime and worked without credit at major Japanese studios outside Toho, creating effects for films such as Daiei's The Invisible Man Appears (1949), widely regarded as the first Japanese science fiction film.\nIn 1950, Tsuburaya returned to Toho alongside his effects crew from Tsuburaya Special Technology Laboratory. At age fifty-three, he gained international recognition and won his first Japan Technical Award for Special Skill for directing the effects in Ishirō Honda's kaiju film Godzilla (1954). He served as the effects director for Toho's string of financially successful tokusatsu films that followed, including, Rodan (1956), The Mysterians (1957), The Three Treasures (1959), Mothra, The Last War (both 1961), and King Kong vs. Godzilla (1962). In April 1963, Tsuburaya founded Tsuburaya Special Effects Productions; his company would go onto produce the television shows Ultra Q, Ultraman (both 1966), Ultraseven (1967–1968), and Mighty Jack (1968). Ultra Q and Ultraman were extremely successful upon their 1966 broadcast, with Ultra Q making him a household name in Japan and gaining him more attention from the media who dubbed him the \"God of Tokusatsu\". While he spent his late years working on several Toho films and operating his company, Tsuburaya's health began to decline, and he died in 1970.","content":"#Biography\n##Childhood to war years: 1901–1945\n###Childhood and youth (1901–1919)\n###Early career and marriage (1919–1934)\n###J.O.

The exchange was founded in 2019 by Sam Bankman-Fried and Gary Wang and collapsed in 2022 after massive fraud perpetrated by Bankman-Fried and his partner Caroline Ellison forced the company to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. \nAt its peak in July 2021, the company had over one million users and was the third-largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume. As of November 2022, FTX was the third-largest digital currency exchange boasting an active trading volume of USD 10 billion and a valuation of USD 32 billion. FTX is incorporated in Antigua and Barbuda and headquartered in the Bahamas. FTX is closely associated with FTX.US, a separate exchange available to US residents.\nSince November 11, 2022, FTX has been in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in the US court system. Public concern began with rumors of unethical and fraudulent inter-company transfers of client funds. In November 2022 CoinDesk also raised concerns stating that FTX's partner firm Alameda Research held a significant portion of its assets in FTX's native token (FTT). Following this revelation, rival exchange Binance's CEO Changpeng Zhao announced that Binance would sell its holdings of the token, which was quickly followed by a spike in customer withdrawals from FTX. \nFTX was unable to meet the demand for customer withdrawals. Binance signed a letter of intent to acquire the firm, with due diligence to follow, to ensure that customers could recover their assets from FTX in a timely manner, but Binance withdrew its offer the next day, citing reports of mishandled customer funds and U.S. agency investigations. On December 12, 2022, founder Sam Bankman-Fried was arrested by the Bahamian authorities for financial offences, at the request of the US government. The current CEO of FTX is John J. Ray III, who specializes in recovering funds from failed corporations.","content":"#History\n#November 2022 crisis and bankruptcy\n##Background: FTX and Alameda, Binance, and CoinDesk report\n##Crisis begins: Binance FTT sale, sell-off, and withdrawn rescue bid\n##Bankruptcy and unauthorized transactions\n##Widening impact and contagion fears\n##Responses and effects\n###Effects on investors\n###Effects on other cryptocurrency firms and cryptocurrency markets\n###Responses and commentary\n#Legal process\n#Sponsorships\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

It officially began on 15 November 2022, and ended on 30 April 2023, with the exception for Mauritius and the Seychelles, for which it ended on 15 May 2023. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical and subtropical cyclones form in the basin, which is west of 90°E and south of the Equator. However, tropical cyclones can form year-round, and all tropical cyclones that form between 1 July 2022 and 30 June 2023 will be part of the season. Tropical and subtropical cyclones in this basin are monitored by the Regional Specialised Meteorological Centre in Réunion and unofficially by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. The season was average in terms of the number of systems that formed, with nine systems becoming at least moderate tropical storms, and six reaching tropical cyclone strength. Activity began early, with the first two systems (Ashley and Balita) developing in September and October, and ended late with Fabien in May. \nThe season featured Cyclone Freddy, which became the longest-lived tropical cyclone on record, beating the previous record of Hurricane John in 1994, and also had the highest accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) of any tropical cyclone on record worldwide, surpassing Hurricane Ioke in 2006. In addition, Freddy is the only known tropical cyclone to achieve seven separate rapid intensification cycles. Additionally, Freddy was the second farthest-traveling tropical cyclone ever observed worldwide, only with 1994's John's. The most intense system of the season was Cyclone Darian.\nIn the month of January, Cyclone Cheneso brought flooding and strong winds to Madagascar. In May, Cyclone Fabien formed close to the equator and became the latest intense tropical cyclone in the satellite era, surpassing Cyclone Billy-Lila of 1986 by six days. Tropical cyclones during this season collectively caused at least 1,483 deaths and more than $501 million in damage.","content":"#Seasonal forecasts\n#Seasonal summary\n#Systems\n##Moderate Tropical Storm Ashley\n##Moderate Tropical Storm Balita\n##Tropical Depression 03\n##Very Intense Tropical Cyclone Darian\n##Tropical Cyclone Cheneso\n##Tropical Cyclone Dingani\n##Very Intense Tropical Cyclone Freddy\n##Tropical Cyclone Enala\n##Moderate Tropical Storm 09\n##Intense Tropical Cyclone Fabien\n#Storm names\n#Season effects\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}
{"title":"Ronald_Reagan","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ronald_Reagan","summary":"Ronald Wilson Reagan (February 6, 1911 – June 5, 2004) was an American politician and actor who served as the 40th president of the United States from 1981 to 1989. A member of the Republican Party, he became an important figure in the American conservative movement, and his presidency is known as the Reagan era.\nBorn and raised in Illinois, Reagan graduated from Eureka College in 1932 and later worked in radio as a sports broadcaster in Iowa. In 1937, he moved to California where he became a well-known film actor. During his acting career, Reagan twice served as the president of the Screen Actors Guild from 1947 to 1952 and from 1959 to 1960. In the 1950s, he began working on television and became a spokesman for General Electric. Subsequently, Reagan's \"A Time for Choosing\" speech during the 1964 U.S. presidential election launched his rise as a leading conservative figure. After being elected governor of California in 1966, he raised the state taxes, turned the state budget deficit into a surplus and implemented harsh crackdowns on university protests. Following his loss to Gerald Ford in the 1976 Republican Party presidential primaries, Reagan won the Republican Party's nomination and then a landslide victory over President Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election.\nIn his first term as U.S. president, Reagan began implementing \"Reaganomics\", which involved economic deregulation and cuts in both taxes and government spending during a period of stagflation. On the world stage, he escalated the arms race, transitioned Cold War policy away from the policies of détente with the Soviet Union, and ordered the 1983 invasion of Grenada. Within the same period, Reagan also survived an assassination attempt, fought public-sector labor unions, expanded the war on drugs, and was slow to respond to the growing AIDS epidemic. In the 1984 presidential election, he defeated Carter's former vice president, Walter Mondale, in another landslide victory. Foreign affairs dominated Reagan's second term, including the 1986 bombing of Libya, the secret and illegal sale of arms to Iran to fund the Contras, and a more conciliatory approach in talks with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev culminating in the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.\nReagan left the presidency in 1989 with the American economy having seen a significant reduction of inflation, the unemployment rate having fallen, and the U.S. having entered its then-longest peacetime expansion. At the same time, the national debt had nearly tripled since 1981 as a result of his cuts in taxes and increased military spending, despite cuts to domestic discretionary spending. Reagan's policies also contributed to the end of the Cold War and the end of Soviet communism. Alzheimer's disease hindered Reagan post-presidency, and his physical and mental capacities gradually deteriorated, ultimately leading to his death in 2004. Historical rankings of U.S. presidents have typically placed Reagan in the upper tier, and his post-presidential approval ratings by the general public are usually high.","content":"#Early life\n#Entertainment career\n##Radio and film\n##Military service\n##Screen Actors Guild presidency\n##Marriages and children\n##Television\n#Early political activities\n##1966 California gubernatorial election\n#California governorship (1967–1975)\n#Seeking the presidency (1975–1981)\n##1976 Republican primaries\n##1980 election\n#Presidency (1981–1989)\n##First inauguration\n##\"Reaganomics\" and the economy\n###Taxation\n###Inflation and unemployment\n###Government spending\n###Deregulation\n###Deficits\n##Assassination attempt\n##Supreme Court appointments\n##Public sector labor union fights\n##Civil rights\n##War on drugs\n##Escalation of the Cold War\n##Invasion of Grenada\n##1984 election\n##Response to the AIDS epidemic\n##Addressing apartheid\n##Libya bombing\n##Iran–Contra affair\n##The USS Stark incident\n##Soviet decline and thaw in relations\n#Post-presidency (1989–2004)\n##Support for Brady Bill\n##Alzheimer's disease\n##Death and funeral\n#Legacy\n##Historical reputation\n##Political influence\n#Notes\n#References\n##Citations\n##Works cited\n###Books\n###Chapters\n###Journal articles\n#External links\n##Official sites\n##Media\n##News coverage\n##Other\n","lang":"en"}
{"title":"Siege_of_Mariupol","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Siege_of_Mariupol","summary":"The siege of Mariupol began on 24 February 2022 and lasted until 20 May, as part of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. It saw fighting between the Russian Armed Forces (alongside the Donetsk People's Republic People's Militia) and the Ukrainian Armed Forces for control over the city of Mariupol in southeastern Ukraine. Lasting for almost three months, the siege ended in a victory for Russia and the Donetsk People's Republic, as Ukraine lost control of the city amidst Russia's eastern Ukraine offensive and southern Ukraine offensive; all Ukrainian troops remaining in the city surrendered at the Azovstal Iron and Steel Works on 20 May 2022, after they were ordered to cease fighting.\nMariupol is located in Ukraine's Donetsk Oblast, and following the siege, it was initially controlled by the Donetsk People's Republic, supported by occupying Russian troops. However, it was later subjected to Russia's unilateral annexation of southeastern Ukraine, and remains under direct Russian control as of 10 May 2023.\nDuring the Russian siege, the Red Cross described the situation in Mariupol as \"apocalyptic\" while Ukrainian authorities accused Russia of engineering a major humanitarian crisis in the city. Ukrainian officials reported that approximately 25,000 civilians had been killed and that at least 95% of the city had been destroyed during the fighting, primarily by large-scale Russian bombardments. In an official statement, the United Nations confirmed the deaths of 1,348 civilians in Mariupol, but warned that the true death toll was likely thousands higher while also reporting that 90% of the city's residential buildings had been damaged or completely destroyed.\nMajor combat operations in the city effectively ended on 16 May 2022, after Ukraine's Azov Regiment surrendered at the Azovstal Iron and Steel Works. Some Western reports described the siege as a pyrrhic or symbolic Russian victory, with others noting that the humanitarian impact of the takeover was a \"reputational disaster\" for Russia. However, the loss of the city has also been seen as a significant defeat for Ukraine.\nBased on the analysis of mass graves, Human Rights Watch estimated at least 10,284 people died in Mariupol from March 2022 to February 2023, but assumes that is an undercount.","content":"#Background\n#Advances to Mariupol\n##Preliminary shelling and advance on the city\n##Mariupol surrounded\n#Urban advances\n##Russian push into the city\n##Final pockets of resistance\n#Resistance in the Azovstal steel plant\n##Withdrawal to Azovstal\n##Siege of Azovstal\n##Evacuation of civilians\n##Ukrainian surrender\n#Aftermath\n##Demolition of buildings and Russification of the city\n##Last Ukrainian holdouts and prisoners of war\n##City government's role\n##Claimed cholera outbreak\n##Ukrainian missile strikes\n#Casualties\n##Military casualties\n##Civilian casualties\n#Humanitarian situation\n#War crimes committed by Russian forces\n##Shooting of evacuation checkpoints\n##Maternity and children's hospital bombing\n##Regional theatre bombing\n##Mass shelling of residential areas\n##Alleged use of chemical weapons\n#Media coverage\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Francis_Drake","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Francis_Drake","summary":"Sir Francis Drake (c. 1540 – 28 January 1596) was an English explorer and privateer best known for his circumnavigation of the world in a single expedition between 1577 and 1580. This was the first English circumnavigation, and second circumnavigation overall. He is also known for participating in the early English slaving voyages of his cousin, Sir John Hawkins, and John Lovell. Having started as a simple seaman, in 1588 he was part of the fight against the Spanish Armada as a vice-admiral.\nAt an early age, Drake was placed into the household of a relative, William Hawkins, a prominent sea captain in Plymouth. In 1572, he set sail on his first independent mission, privateering along the Spanish Main. Drake's circumnavigation began on 15 December 1577. He crossed the Pacific Ocean, until then an area of exclusive Spanish interest, and laid claim to New Albion, plundering coastal towns and ships for treasure and supplies as he went. He arrived back in England on 26 September 1580. Elizabeth I awarded Drake a knighthood in 1581 which he received aboard his galleon the Golden Hind.\nDrake's circumnavigation inaugurated an era of conflict with the Spanish and in 1585, the Anglo-Spanish War began. Drake was in command of an expedition to the Americas that attacked Spanish shipping and ports. When Philip II sent the Spanish Armada to England in 1588 as a precursor to its invasion, Drake was second-in-command of the English fleet that fought against and repulsed the Spanish fleet. A year later he led the English Armada in a failed attempt to destroy the remaining Spanish fleet.\nDrake was the Member of Parliament (MP) for three constituencies: Camelford in 1581, Bossiney in 1584, and Plymouth in 1593. Drake's exploits made him a hero to the English, but his privateering led the Spanish to brand him a pirate, known to them as El Draque (\"The Dragon\" in old Spanish). He died of dysentery after his failed assault on Panama in January 1596.","content":"#Birth and early years\n#Early career at sea\n##Slave trade\n##Expedition of 1572–1573\n##Rathlin Island massacre\n#Circumnavigation (1577–1580)\n##Execution of Thomas Doughty\n##Entering the Pacific (1578)\n##Raids on Spanish American west coast\n##Coast of California: Nova Albion (1579)\n##Across the Pacific and around Africa\n##Return to Plymouth (1580)\n##Knighthood and arms\n#Political career\n#Great Expedition to America\n#Conflict with the Spanish Armada\n##Cádiz raid\n##Defeat of the Spanish Armada\n##English Armada\n#Defeats and death\n#Family and heritage\n#Legacy and honours\n##Geographical names\n#See also\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Joe_Biden_classified_documents_incident","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Joe_Biden_classified_documents_incident","summary":"On January 9, 2023, CBS News reported that attorneys for U.S. President Joe Biden discovered classified government documents in his former office at the Penn Biden Center in Washington, D.C., and in his personal residence in Wilmington, Delaware, dating to his time in the United States Senate and his vice presidency in the Obama administration. The number of documents was later revealed to be between 25 and 30. By June 2023, classified documents from Biden's Senate tenure were discovered in materials donated to the University of Delaware.\nOn November 2, 2022, Biden's attorneys discovered the first set of classified documents in a locked closet at the Penn Biden Center; they reported them that day to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), which retrieved them the next day. The classified documents included intelligence material and briefing memos on Ukraine, Iran and the United Kingdom. In coordination with the Justice Department (DOJ), Biden's attorneys discovered a second set of documents at Biden's home on December 20, followed by several more on January 9 and January 12, 2023. Biden's personal attorney said on January 21 that the Justice Department discovered six items containing classification markings during a consensual search of his home the previous day, some of which dated to his tenure in the Senate; investigators also seized some of Biden's handwritten notes from his vice presidency. On November 14, 2022, Attorney General Merrick Garland assigned U.S. Attorney John R. Lausch Jr. to conduct an initial investigation. On January 12, 2023, Garland appointed Robert K. Hur as special counsel to investigate \"possible unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents or other records\". The next day, the House Judiciary Committee opened a separate investigation into the documents.\nOn February 8, 2024, the Justice Department released the report by special counsel Hur, which concluded that the \"evidence does not establish Mr. Biden's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt\", so \"no criminal charges are warranted in this matter\". For classified documents found in the Penn Biden Center and in the University of Delaware, Hur judged that they \"could plausibly have been brought to these locations by mistake\". For Afghanistan-related classified documents found in the garage of Biden's Delaware home, Hur stated that his investigation could not determine \"why, how, or by whom\" that material was kept. For Biden's handwritten notebooks found in Biden's Delaware home, which included classified content, Hur credited the possibility that Biden treated them as \"personal property\", given \"historical practice\" of the federal government allowing President Ronald Reagan to take home his diaries as \"personal records\" despite their classified content. While Hur found that Biden read out classified information from his notebooks to his ghostwriter, Hur judged that it was not proven that Biden knew that the information was classified. Hur also surmised that in a trial, \"Biden would likely present himself to a jury ... as a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory\" with \"diminished faculties in advancing age\".\nThe report's comments on Biden's memory have sparked substantial political controversy, with The New York Times, The Washington Post,  and New York magazine describing them as overshadowing the report's conclusion against charging Biden. During a press conference later that day, Biden criticized Hur's report for negatively assessing his mental state, describing it as \"extraneous commentary\", and stated \"my memory's fine.\". Biden also harshly criticized Hur for purportedly questioning him about the timing of his son Beau's death, suggesting it was unnecessary.  However, the transcript of Biden's interview showed that it was Biden himself that brought up Beau Biden's death in his testimony. The DOJ defended the report against criticism over inclusion of comments on Biden's memory, stating that the report and its public release fell well within DOJ guidelines.\nIn May 2024, Biden would invoke executive privilege to keep a recording of the Hur interview classified. On June 12, 2024, Garland, who enforced Biden's executive privilege decision to keep the audio of President Biden's interview with Hur classified and would not turn it over to Congress, would be found in Contempt of Congress; despite the fact that the audio recording of the Hur interview was not turned over to Congress, the transcript of the Hur interview had already been turned over.","content":"#Background\n#Discoveries and other developments\n##First batch of documents\n##DOJ letter to Bob Bauer\n##Second batch of documents\n##FBI search of Biden's Wilmington home\n##Other searches\n#Initial responses\n##Biden and his legal team\n##Elected officials\n###Republican elected officials\n###Democratic elected officials\n##Media analysis\n##Misinformation\n##Discovery of classified documents at Mike Pence's residence\n#Investigations\n##Special counsel\n###Decision that charges were unwarranted\n###Comments on Biden's memory\n##Congressional\n#See also\n","lang":"en"}

The fighting occurred during the Chinese Spring Offensive and saw the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade (27th Brigade) establish blocking positions in the Kapyong Valley, on a key route south to the capital, Seoul. The two forward battalions—the 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (3 RAR) and 2nd Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry (2 PPCLI), both battalions consisting of about 700 men each—were supported by guns from the 16th Field Regiment (16 NZFR) of the Royal Regiment of New Zealand Artillery along with two companies of US mortars, fifteen Sherman tanks from US 72nd Heavy Tank Battalion, two companies of the US 74th Engineer Combat Battalion and 1st Battalion, Middlesex Regiment. These forces occupied positions astride the valley with hastily developed defences. As thousands of soldiers from the Republic of Korea Army (ROK) began to withdraw through the valley, the PVA infiltrated the brigade position under the cover of darkness, and assaulted the 3 RAR on Hill 504 during the evening and into the following day. Five companies of the US and UK forces attached to 27th Brigade fled the battlefield without orders, expecting an imminent PVA breakthrough at the Kapyong Valley.\nAlthough heavily outnumbered, the 3 RAR and U.S. tanks held their positions into the afternoon of April 24 before they retreated from the battlefield to a reserve position near brigade headquarters, with both sides having suffered heavy casualties. The PVA then turned their attention to the surrounded 2 PPCLI on Hill 677, whose encirclement prevented any resupply or reinforcements from entering. The 2 PPCLI were ordered to make a last stand on Hill 677. During a fierce night battle on 24\/25 April the PVA forces were unable to dislodge the 2 PPCLI and sustained enormous losses. The next day, the PVA withdrew back up the valley in order to regroup, and the 2 PPCLI were relieved late on 26 April. \n\nThe fighting helped blunt the PVA Spring Offensive and the actions of the 2 PPCLI and 3 RAR at Kapyong were critical in preventing a breakthrough against the UN central front, the encirclement of US forces in Korea, which were at that point in general retreat, and ultimately, the capture of Seoul. The 2 PPCLI and 3 RAR battalions bore the brunt of the assault and stopped PVA divisional forces estimated at 20,000 in strength during the hard-fought defensive battle. Today, the battle is regarded as the most famous and significant action fought by the Canadian and Australian armies in Korea, and the most famous battle fought by the Canadian Armed Forces since WWII.","content":"#Background\n##Military situation\n#Chinese Spring Offensive\n##Preparations\n##Launch of Chinese Spring Offensive\n##South Korean withdrawal, 22–23 April 1951\n#Australian 3 RAR defence of Hill 504, 23–24 April 1951\n##Night battle\n##Day battle\n##3 RAR withdraws\n#Canadian 2 PPCLI last stand on Hill 677, 24–25 April 1951\n##Preparations\n##Night battle\n##Final 2 PPCLI Operations\n#Aftermath\n##Summary and casualties\n##Awards\n##Subsequent operations\n#See also\n#Notes\n##Footnotes\n##Citations\n#References\n#Further reading\n","lang":"en"}

Regularly scheduled elections were held for 34 of the 100 seats in the U.S. Senate, the winners of which will serve 6-year terms beginning with the 118th United States Congress. 2 special elections were held to complete unexpired terms. While pundits considered the Republican Party a slight favorite to gain control of the Senate, the Democrats outperformed expectations and expanded the majority they had held since 2021, gaining a seat for a functioning 51–49 majority.\nSenators are divided into 3 classes whose terms are staggered so that a different class is elected every other year. All 34 Class 3 Senate seats, last elected in 2016, were up for election in 2022. Before the elections, Class 3 consisted of 14 Democrats and 20 Republicans. Special elections were concurrently held in California, to fill Vice President Kamala Harris's unexpired Senate term ending in 2022, and in Oklahoma, to fill the remaining 4 years of Jim Inhofe's unexpired term. 5 Republican senators and 1 Democratic senator; 15 Republicans and 13 Democrats ran for re-election. Before the elections, Democrats had held a majority in the Senate since January 20, 2021. There were 48 Democratic and 2 Independent senators who caucused with them; Harris's tie-breaking vote as vice president gave Democrats control of the chamber.\nWhile Republicans appeared slightly favored in several competitive races, a red wave election did not materialize. Democrats gained a seat, in Pennsylvania where Democrat John Fetterman won the election to succeed retiring Republican Pat Toomey. All incumbents won re-election, and all other open seats besides Pennsylvania were held by the same party as the retiring senator. For the first time since the ratification of the 17th Amendment, no incumbent lost a U.S. Senate primary or general election.\nThe better-than-expected performance of Democrats has been attributed to several factors, including the issue of abortion after Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, the role of Donald Trump, and alleged extremism or election denialism among Republicans. The 2022 election cycle was the first time in U.S. history in which multiple Senate races in the same year were contested between two Black nominees (Georgia and South Carolina).","content":"#Partisan composition\n#Summary results\n##Seats\n##Votes\n#Closest races\n#Change in composition\n##Before the elections\n##After the elections\n##Beginning of the first session\n#Final pre-election predictions\n#Gains and holds\n##Retirements\n##Resignations\n##Post-election changes\n#Race summary\n##Special elections during the preceding Congress\n##Elections leading to the next Congress\n#Alabama\n#Alaska\n#Arizona\n#Arkansas\n#California\n#Colorado\n#Connecticut\n#Florida\n#Georgia\n#Hawaii\n#Idaho\n#Illinois\n#Indiana\n#Iowa\n#Kansas\n#Kentucky\n#Louisiana\n#Maryland\n#Missouri\n#Nevada\n#New Hampshire\n#New York\n#North Carolina\n#North Dakota\n#Ohio\n#Oklahoma\n##Oklahoma (regular)\n##Oklahoma (special)\n#Oregon\n#Pennsylvania\n#South Carolina\n#South Dakota\n#Utah\n#Vermont\n#Washington\n#Wisconsin\n#Notes\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Bloody_Mary_(song)","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bloody_Mary_(song)","summary":"\"Bloody Mary\" is a song by American singer Lady Gaga recorded for her second studio album Born This Way (2011). Gaga, Fernando Garibay, and Paul \"DJ White Shadow\" Blair wrote and produced it; Clinton Sparks also received a producer credit. \"Bloody Mary\" is an electropop song with elements of synth-pop and trance, and features Gregorian chants. Although the song's title is an epithet mostly associated with the English queen Mary Tudor, Gaga assumes the role of biblical figure Mary Magdalene in its lyrics, whom she considered a \"feminine force\" she had worshiped since her childhood in a Catholic girls school. It is one of several tracks on the album with religious themes.\nCritical reception towards \"Bloody Mary\" was generally positive; reviewers called it \"gothic\" and \"spooky\", and highlighted its production values. Gaga's first live performance of the song was at her 2012–2013 Born This Way Ball concert tour, where she was seen \"floating\" above stage in a white outfit with two similarly dressed dancers. During the Joanne World Tour (2017–2018), she wore a bold red puffer coat and eye mask for the performance. English rock band the Horrors remixed \"Bloody Mary\" for Gaga's second remix album Born This Way: The Remix (2011).\nIn 2022, following the release of the Netflix comedy horror series Wednesday, the titular character's dance and its fan recreations to a sped-up version of the song went viral on video sharing service TikTok. This resulted in a large increase in plays of the song on Spotify, and \"Bloody Mary\" was sent to French and Italian radio as the album's sixth single in December 2022, eleven years after the release of Born This Way. The following month, it was also sent to US pop and adult contemporary radios. After being released as a single, the song charted in Europe and North America; it reached the top 40 on the singles charts of several nations including Italy, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom; and the top 10 on the pop and hot adult contemporary radio formats in the United States.","content":"#Influences and lyrical content\n##Thematic analysis\n#Recording and composition\n#Critical reception\n#Single release and media appearances\n#Commercial performance\n#Remix versions\n#Live performances\n#Credits and personnel\n#Charts\n#Certifications and sales\n#Release history\n#Notes\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"SummerSlam_(2023)","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/SummerSlam_(2023)","summary":"The 2023 SummerSlam, also promoted as SummerSlam: Detroit, was the 36th annual SummerSlam professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming event produced by WWE. It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. The event took place on Saturday, August 5, 2023, at Ford Field in Detroit, Michigan, returning the event to its traditional August slot after the previous year's event was held in July. This was the first SummerSlam livestreamed on Binge in Australia. It was the first WWE event held at Ford Field since WrestleMania 23 in April 2007. Michigan previously hosted SummerSlam in 1993.\nNine matches were contested at the event, with four promoted as main event matches. In the final match of the night, which was one of SmackDown's two main matches, Roman Reigns defeated Jey Uso in Tribal Combat to retain the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship and recognition of Tribal Chief of the Anoaʻi family. For SmackDown's other main match, Bianca Belair defeated defending champion Asuka and Charlotte Flair in a triple threat match to win the WWE Women's Championship, after which, Iyo Sky cashed in her Money in the Bank contract and defeated Belair to win the title. For Raw's two main matches, Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins defeated Finn Bálor to retain the World Heavyweight Championship and Cody Rhodes defeated Brock Lesnar. The event also featured Ronda Rousey's final WWE appearance; she lost to Shayna Baszler in an MMA Rules match at the event and then left WWE in October.\nAccording to WWE, this was the highest-grossing SummerSlam of all time, as well as the company's highest-grossing event outside of WrestleMania. WWE claimed an attendance of 59,194; however, this number has been disputed, with an actual paid attendance of 51,477. It was the second-largest crowd in SummerSlam history, after the 1992 event. This would subsequently be the final SummerSlam in which WWE was majority owned and controlled by the McMahon family before the company's deal with Endeavor was finalized on September 12, 2023, which saw WWE and Endeavor-owned Ultimate Fighting Championship subsequently merging to become divisions of a new jointly formed corporate entity called TKO Group Holdings. This was also the final WWE event to be officially distributed on Blu-ray in Europe, as WWE opted not to renew Fremantle's contract for home video releases after 2023, and shut their home video division down in 3 months later at the end of the year. SummerSlam had a 1-disc Blu-ray and 2-disc DVD release on September 25 in the United Kingdom.","content":"#Production\n##Background\n##Storylines\n#Event\n##Preliminary matches\n##Main event\n#Reception\n#Aftermath\n##Raw\n##SmackDown\n#Results\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

The shooter, identified as a 13-year-old Kosta Kecmanović, opened fire on students and staff, resulting in the deaths of ten individuals, including nine students and a security guard. Six others, five students and a teacher, also sustained injuries.\nKecmanović surrendered willingly and was taken into custody. However, due to his age being below 14, which falls below Serbia's age of criminal responsibility, he could not face legal charges. His father legally owned the firearms used in the incident. Since the apprehension, Kecmanović has been placed under the care of a psychiatric hospital located in Belgrade. Meanwhile, legal actions have been initiated against his parents. His father faces charges for acts against public safety, while the mother is charged with criminal possession of a weapon. Their criminal trial began on January 29, 2024.\nThe attack occurred one day before a separate mass shooting in Serbia. Both shootings caused protests in the country.","content":"#Background\n##Serbia's gun laws and previous shootings\n##School\n#Shooting\n#Casualties\n#Investigation\n##On-site\n##Off-site\n##Kecmanović's parents\n##Kecmanović's questioning\n#Civil lawsuits\n#Aftermath\n##Official measures\n###Hand Over Your Weapons\n###Inquiry Committee\n##Continuation of classes\n###2022–23 school year\n###2023–24 school year\n##Kecmanović's further education\n##Protests\n##Domino effect arrests\n##Other\n#Reactions\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

It was the first time that any monarch in British history celebrated a platinum jubilee, as is the case in the histories of the other Commonwealth realms.\nInitiatives to commemorate the jubilee were announced by the governments of many realms—including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, and the United Kingdom—of territories, such as the Cayman Islands and Gibraltar, and celebrations were also held in other Commonwealth member states, like the Gambia, Malaysia, Malta, Pakistan, and Samoa. Leaders from across the world, including from China, North Korea, France, Germany, Israel, and the United States, sent messages of congratulations to the Queen on reaching the milestone. In the United Kingdom, there was an extra bank holiday on 3 June and the usual spring bank holiday was moved from the end of May to 2 June to create the four-day Platinum Jubilee Central Weekend from Thursday, 2 June, to Sunday, 5 June. Commemorative stamps and coins were issued by several Commonwealth nations and beacons were lit in every Commonwealth capital for the first time. In many places, trees were planted in the Queen's honour.\nThe Queen died in her Platinum Jubilee year, on 8 September 2022, at the age of 96. Her funeral took place at Westminster Abbey in London on 19 September 2022 and she was buried at the King George VI Memorial Chapel in Windsor Castle later that day.","content":"#Accession Day 2022\n#Jubilee emblems\n##United Kingdom\n##Canada\n##Australia\n##New Zealand\n#Celebrations throughout the Commonwealth\n##United Kingdom\n###Queen's Green Canopy\n###Jubilee stamps and coins\n###Events leading up to June\n###Central weekend\n####2 June\n####3 June\n####4 June\n####5 June\n###Displays and exhibitions\n###Other tributes and events\n##Crown Dependencies\n###Guernsey\n####Guernsey platinum jubilee flag\n###Jersey\n###Isle of Man\n##British Overseas Territories\n###Bermuda\n###British Antarctic Territory\n###British Virgin Islands\n###Cayman Islands\n###Falkland Islands\n###Gibraltar\n###Montserrat\n###Pitcairn Islands\n###Turks and Caicos Islands\n##Canada\n###Planning\n###Accession Day events in Canada\n###Tributes across the country\n###Events from February to May\n###Commemorations throughout summer\n##Australia\n###Accession Day events in Australia\n###Memorabilia\n###Commemorations in June\n###Other events\n##New Zealand\n###Tributes and commemoration\n###Events from June\n##Pakistan\n##Ghana\n##Malaysia\n##Jamaica\n##Trinidad and Tobago\n##Kenya\n##Malta\n##Zambia\n##The Gambia\n##Barbados\n##Samoa\n##Bangladesh\n##Bahamas\n##Papua New Guinea\n##Solomon Islands\n##Tuvalu\n##Saint Lucia\n##Belize\n##Antigua and Barbuda\n##Saint Kitts and Nevis\n##Brunei\n#Commemorations outside the Commonwealth\n##Public celebrations\n###Commonwealth communities abroad\n###Initiatives by British diplomatic missions\n###France\n###United States\n#Jubilee visits\n##Akrotiri and Dhekelia\n##Antigua and Barbuda\n##Australia\n##Bahamas\n##Belize\n##Canada\n##Cyprus\n##Gibraltar\n##Grenada\n##Guernsey\n##Ireland\n##Jamaica\n##Jersey\n##Papua New Guinea\n##Saint Lucia\n##Saint Vincent and the Grenadines\n#Online significance\n#Death of the Queen\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"2023_Stanley_Cup_playoffs","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2023_Stanley_Cup_playoffs","summary":"The 2023 Stanley Cup playoffs was the playoff tournament of the National Hockey League (NHL) for the 2022–23 season. The playoffs began on April 17, 2023, three days after the end of the regular season, and concluded on June 13, 2023, with the Vegas Golden Knights winning their first Stanley Cup in franchise history, defeating the Florida Panthers four games to one in the Stanley Cup Finals.\nThe Boston Bruins made the playoffs as the Presidents' Trophy winners after setting the league record for the most wins and points in a single regular season. The Pittsburgh Penguins failed to make the playoffs for the first time since the 2005–06 NHL season, ending the NHL's and major North American sports' longest active playoff streak at sixteen consecutive seasons. The new longest active playoffs streak in major North American sports belonged to MLB's Los Angeles Dodgers, who qualified for the postseason every year since 2013. The longest active Stanley Cup playoff streak moved to the Boston Bruins and Toronto Maple Leafs at seven consecutive seasons after the Nashville Predators and Washington Capitals also had their eight-season playoff streaks end. As a result, this is the first time since 1976 that the longest active playoff streak was less than ten consecutive seasons. The Seattle Kraken became the second fastest NHL expansion team since 1991 to qualify for the playoffs, after the Vegas Golden Knights, and the first to clinch their inaugural playoff appearance in their second season in the league since the Quebec Nordiques in 1981. The Kraken also became the first NHL exclusive expansion team to make their first playoff appearance in their second season since the Atlanta Flames in 1974. All three New York metropolitan area teams (the Devils, Islanders and Rangers) made the playoffs in the same year for the first time since 2007. For the first time since 1990 and second time since entering the NHL as expansion teams in the 1967–68 NHL season, both Pennsylvania-based teams (the Flyers and Penguins) missed the playoffs in the same season.\nThis postseason marked the second consecutive and fourth time overall that the league played 50 or more games in the opening round of the playoffs since this round was changed to a best-of-seven format in 1987. In addition, visiting teams in the first round went 31–19 overall to set a new league record for the most road wins in a single round. Among these opening round road victories, the Florida Panthers overcame a 3–1 series deficit to upset the Presidents' Trophy-winning Boston Bruins in seven games, the Seattle Kraken defeated the defending champion Colorado Avalanche in seven games to win their first playoff series, and the Toronto Maple Leafs eliminated the Tampa Bay Lightning on the road in game six to win their first series since the 2004 Eastern Conference quarterfinals.\nFor the fourth consecutive year, a Florida-based team reached the Stanley Cup Finals. For the first time, the conference finals consisted exclusively of teams located in the Sun Belt, with the Florida Panthers and the Carolina Hurricanes in the Eastern Conference final, and the Dallas Stars and the Vegas Golden Knights in the Western Conference final.","content":"#Playoff seeds\n##Eastern Conference\n###Atlantic Division\n###Metropolitan Division\n###Wild cards\n##Western Conference\n###Central Division\n###Pacific Division\n###Wild cards\n#Map of playoff teams\n#Playoff bracket\n#First round\n##Eastern Conference first round\n###(A1) Boston Bruins vs. (WC2) Florida Panthers\n###(A2) Toronto Maple Leafs vs. (A3) Tampa Bay Lightning\n###(M1) Carolina Hurricanes vs. (WC1) New York Islanders\n###(M2) New Jersey Devils vs. (M3) New York Rangers\n##Western Conference first round\n###(C1) Colorado Avalanche vs. (WC1) Seattle Kraken\n###(C2) Dallas Stars vs. (C3) Minnesota Wild\n###(P1) Vegas Golden Knights vs. (WC2) Winnipeg Jets\n###(P2) Edmonton Oilers vs. (P3) Los Angeles Kings\n#Second round\n##Eastern Conference second round\n###(A2) Toronto Maple Leafs vs. (WC2) Florida Panthers\n###(M1) Carolina Hurricanes vs. (M2) New Jersey Devils\n##Western Conference second round\n###(C2) Dallas Stars vs. (WC1) Seattle Kraken\n###(P1) Vegas Golden Knights vs. (P2) Edmonton Oilers\n#Conference finals\n##Eastern Conference final\n###(M1) Carolina Hurricanes vs. (WC2) Florida Panthers\n##Western Conference final\n###(P1) Vegas Golden Knights vs. (C2) Dallas Stars\n#Stanley Cup Finals\n#Player statistics\n##Skaters\n##Goaltenders\n#Media\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"BTS","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/BTS","summary":"BTS (Korean: 방탄소년단; RR: Bangtan Sonyeondan; lit. Bulletproof Boy Scouts), also known as the Bangtan Boys, is a South Korean boy band formed in 2010. The band consists of Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook, who co-write or co-produce much of their material. Originally a hip hop group, they expanded their musical style to incorporate a wide range of genres, while their lyrics have focused on subjects including mental health, the troubles of school-age youth and coming of age, loss, the journey towards self-love, individualism, and the consequences of fame and recognition. Their discography and adjacent work has also referenced literature, philosophy and psychology, and includes an alternate universe storyline.\nBTS debuted in 2013 under Big Hit Entertainment with the single album 2 Cool 4 Skool. BTS released their first Korean and Japanese-language studio albums, Dark & Wild and Wake Up respectively, in 2014. The group's second Korean studio album, Wings (2016), was their first to sell one million copies in South Korea. By 2017, BTS had crossed into the global music market and led the Korean Wave into the United States, becoming the first Korean ensemble to receive a Gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for their single \"Mic Drop\", as well as the first act from South Korea to top the Billboard 200 with their studio album Love Yourself: Tear (2018). In 2020, BTS became the fastest group since the Beatles to chart four US number-one albums in less than two years, with Love Yourself: Answer (2018) becoming the first Korean album certified Platinum by the RIAA; in the same year, they also became the first all-South Korean act to reach number one on both the Billboard Hot 100 and Billboard Global 200 with their Grammy-nominated single \"Dynamite\". Follow-up releases \"Savage Love\", \"Life Goes On\", \"Butter\", and \"Permission to Dance\" made them the fastest act to earn four US number-one singles since Justin Timberlake in 2006.\nAs of 2023, BTS is the best-selling musical act in South Korean history according to the Circle Chart, having sold in excess of 40 million albums. Their studio album Map of the Soul: 7 (2020) is the fourth best-selling album of all time in South Korea, as well as the first in the country to surpass both four and five million registered sales. They are the first non-English-speaking and Asian act to sell out concerts at Wembley Stadium and the Rose Bowl (Love Yourself World Tour, 2019), and were named the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry's (IFPI) Global Recording Artist of the Year for both 2020 and 2021. The group's accolades include multiple American Music Awards, Billboard Music Awards, Golden Disc Awards, and nominations for five Grammy Awards. Outside of music, they have addressed three sessions of the United Nations General Assembly and partnered with UNICEF in 2017 to establish the Love Myself anti-violence campaign. Featured on Time's international cover as \"Next Generation Leaders\" and dubbed the \"Princes of Pop\", BTS has also appeared on Time's lists of the 25 most influential people on the internet (2017–2019) and the 100 most influential people in the world (2019), and in 2018 became the youngest recipients of the South Korean Order of Cultural Merit for their contributions in spreading the Korean culture and language.\nOn June 14, 2022, the group announced a scheduled pause in group activities to enable the members to complete their 18 months of mandatory South Korean military service, with a reunion planned for 2025.

Created by Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, it stars Jenna Ortega as the titular character, with Gwendoline Christie, Riki Lindhome, Jamie McShane, Hunter Doohan, Percy Hynes White, Emma Myers, Joy Sunday, Georgie Farmer, Naomi J. Ogawa, Christina Ricci, and Moosa Mostafa appearing in supporting roles. Four out of the eight episodes of the first season were directed by Tim Burton, who also serves as executive producer. The first season revolves around Wednesday Addams, who attempts to solve a murder mystery at her new school.\nBurton was previously approached to direct the 1991 film The Addams Family and was involved with a cancelled stop-motion animated The Addams Family film. In October 2020, he was reported to be helming a television series, which was later given a series order by Netflix. Ortega was cast in part to represent the character's Latina heritage. Ricci, who had played the titular character in the 1991 film and its 1993 sequel Addams Family Values, was asked by Burton to join the series in a supporting role. Filming took place in Romania between September 2021 and March 2022.\nWednesday premiered on November 16, 2022, and was released on Netflix on November 23 to predominantly positive reviews from critics, who praised Ortega's performance.

{"title":"Hurricane_Nicole_(2022)","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hurricane_Nicole_(2022)","summary":"Hurricane Nicole was a sprawling late-season Category 1 hurricane in November 2022. The fourteenth named storm and eighth hurricane of the 2022 Atlantic hurricane season, Nicole formed as a subtropical cyclone on November 7, from a non-tropical area of low pressure near the Greater Antilles, and transitioned into a tropical cyclone the next day. Then, taking a path similar to that of Hurricane Dorian three years earlier, Nicole made landfall on November 9, on Great Abaco and on Grand Bahama in The Bahamas, where it strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane. On November 10, it made landfall twice in Florida, south of Vero Beach and then northwest of Cedar Key, after briefly emerging over the Gulf of Mexico. Nicole then weakened to a depression while moving over the Florida Panhandle, and then was absorbed into a mid-latitude trough and cold front over extreme eastern Tennessee the following day.\nNicole became the third November hurricane on record to make landfall in Florida, along with the 1935 Yankee hurricane and Hurricane Kate in 1985. Nicole crossed the same region in Florida devastated six weeks earlier by Hurricane Ian, and was the first hurricane to make landfall on Florida's east coast since Katrina in 2005. Despite being relatively weak, Nicole's large size produced widespread heavy rainfall and strong winds across the Greater Antilles, the Bahamas, and Florida, knocking out power and inflicting significant damage in many areas.

{"title":"Lionel_Messi","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lionel_Messi","summary":"Lionel Andrés Messi (Spanish pronunciation: [ljoˈnel anˈdɾes ˈmesi] ; born 24 June 1987), also known as Leo Messi, is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a forward for and captains both Major League Soccer club Inter Miami and the Argentina national team. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Messi set numerous records for individual accolades won throughout his professional footballing career such as eight Ballon d'Or awards and eight times being named the world's best player by FIFA. He is the most decorated player in the history of professional football having won 45 team trophies, including twelve league titles, four UEFA Champions Leagues, two Copa Américas, and one FIFA World Cup. Messi holds the records for most European Golden Shoes (6), most goals for a single club (672, with Barcelona), most goals (474), hat-tricks (36) and assists (192) in La Liga, most matches played (39), assists (18) and goal contributions (34) in the Copa América, most matches played (26) and goal contributions (21) in the World Cup, most international appearances (189) and international goals (112) by a South American male, and the second-most in the latter category outright. A prolific goalscorer and creative playmaker, Messi has scored over 850 senior career goals for club and country.\nBorn in Rosario, Argentina, Messi relocated to Spain to join Barcelona at age 13, and made his competitive debut at age 17 in October 2004. He established himself as an integral player for the club within the next three years, and in his first uninterrupted season in 2008–09 helped Barcelona achieve the first treble in Spanish football; that year, aged 22, Messi won the first of his four consecutive Ballons d'Or, the first player to win it four times. During the 2011–12 season, he set La Liga and European records for most goals in a season, while establishing himself as Barcelona's all-time top scorer. The following two seasons, he finished second for the Ballon d'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo, his perceived career rival, before regaining his best form during the 2014–15 campaign, where he became the all-time top scorer in La Liga, led Barcelona to a historic second treble, and won a fifth Ballon d'Or in 2015. Messi assumed captaincy of Barcelona in 2018, and won a record sixth Ballon d'Or in 2019. During his overall tenure at Barcelona, Messi won a club-record 34 trophies, including ten La Liga titles and four UEFA Champions Leagues, among others. He signed for French club Paris Saint-Germain in August 2021, where he would win the Ligue 1 title during both of his seasons there. Messi joined American club Inter Miami in July 2023, and set a new mark for most goals scored for the club by his second season.\nAn Argentine international, Messi is the national team's all-time leading goalscorer and most-capped player. His style of play as a diminutive, left-footed dribbler drew career-long comparisons with compatriot Diego Maradona, who described Messi as his successor. At the youth level, he won the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship and gold medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics. After his senior debut in 2005, Messi became the youngest Argentine to play and score in a World Cup (2006). He assumed the national team's captaincy in 2011, and then led Argentina to three consecutive finals: the 2014 FIFA World Cup, the 2015 Copa América and the Copa América Centenario, all of which they would lose. After initially announcing his international retirement in 2016, he returned to help his country narrowly qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, which they would again exit early. Messi and the national team finally broke Argentina's 28-year trophy drought with a victory in the 2021 Copa América, where he was named the tournament's best player and which later helped him win his seventh Ballon d'Or that year. He then led Argentina to win the 2022 FIFA World Cup, his country's third overall victory in the tournament and first in 36 years. This followed with a record-extending eighth Ballon d'Or in 2023. A second Copa América victory with Messi as captain came in 2024. \nMessi has endorsed sportswear company Adidas since 2006. According to France Football, he was the world's highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009 and 2014, and was ranked the world's highest-paid athlete by Forbes in 2019 and 2022. Messi was among Time's 100 most influential people in the world in 2011, 2012, and 2023. In 2020 and 2023, he was named the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year, the first team-sport athlete to win it. In 2020, Messi was named to the Ballon d'Or Dream Team and became the second footballer and second team-sport athlete to surpass $1 billion in career earnings.","content":"#Early life\n#Youth career\n##Newell's Old Boys (1995–2000)\n##Barcelona (2000–2004)\n#Club career\n##Barcelona (2004–2021)\n###2004–2008: Rise to the first team\n###2008–2012: Success under Pep Guardiola\n###2012–2014: Record-breaking year and Messidependencia\n###2014–2017: Arrival of Luis Enrique and birth of MSN\n###2017–2021: Final years at Barcelona\n##Paris Saint-Germain (2021–2023)\n##Inter Miami (2023–present)\n#International career\n#Player profile\n##Style of play\n##Tactical positioning\n#Reception\n##Comparisons with Cristiano Ronaldo\n##Comparisons with Diego Maradona\n#In popular culture\n##Popularity\n##Wealth and sponsorships\n##Philanthropy\n##Public art\n##Media\n##Business ventures\n#Personal life\n##Family and relationships\n##Tax fraud\n#Career statistics\n##Club\n##International\n#Honours\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

At the junior level, Chen is the 2015–16 Junior Grand Prix Final champion, 2013–14 Junior Grand Prix Final bronze medalist, 2014 World Junior bronze medalist, and a six-time Junior Grand Prix medalist (5 gold, 1 silver).\nChen, who has been referred to as one of the greatest men's figure skaters of all time by news outlets, holds the highest winning percentage in competitions in the modern era with a more-than-three-year winning streak from 2018 to 2021 in what has been described as one of the most dominant four-year stretches in the sport's history. Chen is recognized for performing the most technically difficult programs in the world and is credited for exceeding the expectations of athletic ability in the sport; he is known as the \"Quad King\" for his mastery of quadruple jumps. Chen is the first skater to have landed all types of quadruple jumps, except the quadruple Axel, in competition. He has broken world and national records, and is the current world record holder for men in the short program and combined total score, and former world record holder in the free skate under the ISU Judging System. He currently holds the highest total scores of three major ISU competitions: the Olympics, the Four Continent Championships, and the Grand Prix Final. Chen is the first Asian American man to win U.S., world, and Olympic titles in single skating. At age 17, Chen became the youngest U.S. champion since Dick Button (1946), and in 2022 became the first man to win six consecutive U.S. titles since Button (1946–52). When Chen won the 2018 World Championships, he became the youngest World Champion since Evgeni Plushenko (2001).

In 2022, he appeared in Time magazine's list of the 100 most-influential people in the world and was announced as one of Harper's Bazaar's Icons. Chen was included in Forbes's  2020 30 under 30 Sports list.

The single person most identified as \"Father\" of the United States is George Washington, a general in the American Revolution and the 1st President of the United States.  In 1973, historian Richard B. Morris identified seven figures as key founders, based on what he called the \"triple tests\" of leadership, longevity, and statesmanship: John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, John Jay, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and Washington.\nMost of the Founding Fathers were of English ancestry, though many had family roots extending across various regions of the British Isles, including Scotland, Wales, and Ireland. Additionally, some traced their lineage back to the early Dutch settlers of New York (New Netherland) during the colonial era, while others were descendants of French Huguenots who settled in the colonies, escaping religious persecution in France.","content":"#Historical founders\n#Origin of phrase\n#List of Founding Fathers\n##Framers and signers\n###Other delegates\n##Additional Founding Fathers\n##Women founders\n##Other patriots\n#The colonies unite (1765–1774)\n#Continental Congress (1774–1775)\n##First Continental Congress (1774)\n##Second Continental Congress (1775)\n#Declaration of Independence (1776)\n#Fighting for independence\n##Treaty of Paris\n#Constitutional Convention\n##Virginia and New Jersey plans\n##Connecticut Compromise\n##State ratification conventions\n##New form of government\n##Bill of Rights\n#Ascending to the presidency\n#Demographics and other characteristics\n##Political experience\n##Education\n###American institutions\n###British institutions\n##Ethnicity\n##Occupations\n#Religion\n#Founders on currency and postage\n#Political and cultural impact\n##Political rhetoric\n##Holidays\n##Media and theater\n##Sports\n#Religious freedom\n#Slavery\n##Reconstruction as a \"Second Founding\"\n#Scholarly analysis\n##Early historians\n##Modern historians\n##Noted collections\n#See also\n#Notes\n#Citations\n#Bibliography\n##Journal articles\n##Online sources\n#Further reading\n##Books\n##Journal articles\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Tennis_pro_tours_and_tournament_ranking_series","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tennis_pro_tours_and_tournament_ranking_series","summary":"For many years before the Open Era of tennis in 1968, the usual format for the handful of touring tennis professionals was a series of two-man one-night stands across the United States and often in other countries as well. The most notable of these tours were the \"World Series\" or \"World Professional Championships\", in which the reigning world champion went head-to-head against a challenger, most often the leading amateur of the previous year who had just turned pro. Promoters would attempt to sign the leading amateur to a contract with a minimum guarantee against a percentage of gate receipts, making a similar type of deal with the reigning professional champion and sometimes giving smaller percentages to undercard players. The winners of the tours were described as being the \"world champion\".\nAfter World War II, with an increasing number of prominent professional players, there were occasionally tournament series with point systems which created official rankings for the complete field of pros. The tournament ranking series were held in 1946, 1959 and 1960 and there were also World Championship tours in these same three years involving only a few pros. The last World Championship two-man tour was held in 1963, featuring a final set of matches of Ken Rosewall against Rod Laver. From 1964 until 1967, a tournament series with a point system determined the pro No. 1 player. Some shorter two-man or four-man tours continued to be held from 1964 onward, as there had been since the late 1920s, but without a world title at stake.","content":"#World Championship tours\n##Winners\n#Tournament ranking series\n##Winners\n#Other professional tours\n##Women\n##Men\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. The event took place on Saturday, January 28, 2023, at the Alamodome in San Antonio, Texas as part of the Alamodome's 30th-anniversary celebration. It was the fourth Royal Rumble event to be held in San Antonio after the 1997, 2007, and 2017 events and the third to take place at the Alamodome, following 1997 and 2017. It was also WWE's first event to be livestreamed on Binge in Australia following the merger of the WWE Network under Binge in the country.\nThe event is based around the Royal Rumble match and the winner traditionally receives a world championship match at that year's WrestleMania. For the 2023 event, only the women's match winner received a choice of which world championship to challenge for at WrestleMania 39. Due to Raw's WWE Championship and SmackDown's Universal Championship being held and defended together as the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship, the men's winner received a match for the tandem titles, while the women had their choice between the Raw or SmackDown Women's Championship. While the Royal Rumble match is typically the main event of the card, this was the seventh Royal Rumble event in which the match was not the main event, after 1988, 1996, 1997, 1998, 2006, and 2013. It was also the first Royal Rumble event where the eponymous match opened the show.\nFive matches were contested on the card. In the main event, Roman Reigns defeated Kevin Owens to retain the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship. For the Royal Rumble matches, Raw's Rhea Ripley won the women's match, becoming the first woman to win the match from the number one spot as well as setting the record for longest time spent in the women's Rumble at 1:01:08 (which was broken in 2024 by Bayley at 1:03:03), while Raw's Cody Rhodes won the men's in the opening match by last eliminating #1 entrant Gunther, who also set the record for longest time spent in a men's 30-man Rumble at 1:11:40 and the second man to draw #1 and emerge as runner-up. In another prominent match, Bray Wyatt, in his first televised match since WrestleMania 37 in April 2021, defeated LA Knight in a Pitch Black match in a cross-promotion with Mountain Dew. This would also be Wyatt's final televised match as he contracted COVID-19 the following month, which exacerbated a heart issue and he died of a heart attack in August. The event also saw the return of color commentator Pat McAfee, who joined Michael Cole and Corey Graves on commentary, Cody Rhodes, Edge, Beth Phoenix, Asuka, Chelsea Green and Nia Jax made returns, and Logan Paul made his first Royal Rumble appearance. Former WWE wrestler Michelle McCool also made an appearance in the women's Royal Rumble match, while WWE Hall of Famer and NXT commentator Booker T appeared in the men's.","content":"#Production\n##Background\n##Storylines\n#Event\n##Preliminary matches\n##Main event\n#Reception\n#Aftermath\n##Raw\n##SmackDown\n#Results\n##Men's Royal Rumble match entrances and eliminations\n##Women's Royal Rumble match entrances and eliminations\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

Finishing with a 12–5 record, the Rams reached their fifth Super Bowl appearance after acquiring veteran quarterback Matthew Stafford, who had not won a playoff game in his previous 12 years with the Detroit Lions. The Bengals, who finished with a 10–7 record, were seeking their first Super Bowl title following several decades of losing seasons and two previous Super Bowl losses. They won their first playoff game since 1990, ending the longest drought in the four major North American sports, en route to their third Super Bowl appearance and first since 1988's Super Bowl XXIII. Each team finished the regular season as their respective conference's 4-seed, making this the first Super Bowl without a top-3 seed since seeding was introduced in 1975.\nThe game had three lead changes and mostly kept within a one-possession margin. Los Angeles led 13–10 at halftime, but the Bengals scored 10 straight points on their first two drives in the third quarter. Trailing 20–16 in the fourth, the Rams scored a touchdown to retake the lead with under two minutes remaining and stopped Cincinnati's final drive on downs. Wide receiver Cooper Kupp, who converted a fourth down on the Rams' final drive and scored the game-winning touchdown, was named Super Bowl MVP.\nNBC's broadcast of Super Bowl LVI was the second-most watched in the game's history, marking a shift from several years of declining ratings. Seen by an average of 112.3 million total viewers on both NBC and its streaming platforms, the game's ratings were up 8% from the previous Super Bowl.","content":"#Background\n##Host selection process\n##Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic\n#Teams\n##Los Angeles Rams\n##Cincinnati Bengals\n##Playoffs\n##Pre-game notes\n#Entertainment\n##Pre-game ceremonies\n##Halftime show\n#Broadcasting\n##United States\n###Television\n####Advertising\n###Streaming\n###Radio\n###Ratings and viewership\n##International\n#Game summary\n##First half\n##Second half\n##Box score\n#Final statistics\n##Statistical comparison\n##Individual statistics\n#Starting lineups\n#Officials\n#Aftermath\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Canada_national_ringette_team","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Canada_national_ringette_team","summary":"The Canada national ringette team (popularly known as Team Canada; French: Équipe Canada) is the ringette team representing Canada internationally. Canada has both a senior national team, Team Canada Senior, and a junior national team, Team Canada Junior. Both national teams compete in the World Ringette Championships (WRC) and are overseen by Ringette Canada which is a member of the International Ringette Federation (IRF). Some team members are selected from the National Ringette League. Team Canada and Team Finland have emerged as ringette's major international rivals at both the senior and junior level. Some of Canada's national teams have been inducted into the Ringette Canada Hall of Fame.\nCanada's first appearance in international ringette began at the inaugural World Ringette Championships which was the 1990 World Ringette Championships, when Canada sent six different regional teams from across the country to represent the nation. At that time, Canada had not yet established a national team, and rather, regional teams competed for the championship instead. Team Alberta, which was composed of members of the province's Calgary Debs who were all-star players from across Alberta, emerged victorious from the tournament.\nCanada achieved its first unified national ringette team in the 1996 World Ringette Championships. This was a significant milestone for the sport, as it marked the first time that only one team represented the nation in international ringette competitions. Previously, regional teams, like Team Alberta, represented Canada in international tournaments. The formation of this national team paved the way for greater standardization in the sport and allowed Canada to bring its best players together to compete on the world stage. The Canadian national ringette team has since become a dominant force in international ringette competitions, winning several gold medals in the World Ringette Championships.\nThe next time Canada competed was at the 1998 Summit Series where both Team Canada Senior and Team Finland Senior competed exclusively in a European tour.\nThe 2009 World Junior Ringette Championships was the first-ever international tournament exclusively for junior ringette players and took place in Prague, Czech Republic. Two different teams represented the country: Canada East, and Canada West. This marked another important moment in the history of the sport, as it was the first time that nations specifically competed against each other with their best young players, all of whom were U19 (Under-19). Later, the junior tournament merged with the senior tournament at the 2013 World Ringette Championships during the 50th anniversary of the sport. That same year, Canada established its first-ever all-junior national ringette team, taking the opportunity to send upcoming players to the merged junior-senior tournament. The creation of the all-junior team allowed Canada to continue its tradition of success in the international scene and also provided a pathway for young players to represent their country on a global stage.","content":"#Early history\n#World Championship record\n##Summit Series\n##Senior Canada\n##Junior Canada\n#Team Canada Senior\n#Team Canada Junior\n#Medal record\n##Senior medal record\n##Junior medal record\n#Notable people\n##Players\n##Samuel Perry Jacks\n##Mirl Arthur McCarthy\n#Team Canada goalies\n#Gallery\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

It is the fifth and final installment in the Indiana Jones film series and the sequel to Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008). It stars Harrison Ford, John Rhys-Davies, and Karen Allen reprising their roles as Indiana Jones, Sallah, and Marion Ravenwood, respectively, while new cast members include Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Antonio Banderas, Toby Jones, Boyd Holbrook, Ethann Isidore, and Mads Mikkelsen. Set in 1969, the film follows Jones and his estranged goddaughter, Helena, who are trying to locate a powerful artifact before Dr. Jürgen Voller, a Nazi-turned-NASA scientist, who plans to use it to alter the outcome of World War II.\nDial of Destiny is the only film in the series that is neither directed by Steven Spielberg nor conceived by George Lucas, with both serving as executive producers instead. It is also the first film in the series not to be distributed by Paramount Pictures, following Walt Disney Studios' acquisition of Lucasfilm and film rights for future sequels. Paramount retains the distribution rights to the first four films and a residual associate credit.\nPlans for a fifth Indiana Jones film date back to the late 1970s, when a deal was made with Paramount to produce four sequels to Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981). Lucas began researching potential plot devices for a fifth film in 2008, and Koepp was eventually hired to write the film in 2016. A release date was set for 2019, which was delayed several times due to rewrites and the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2018, Jonathan Kasdan replaced Koepp and eventually left the project. Spielberg was originally set to direct but stepped down in 2020, with Mangold taking his place. Filming began in June 2021 in various locations including the United Kingdom, Italy, and Morocco, wrapping in February 2022. Longtime franchise composer John Williams returned to compose and conduct the film's score, for which he was nominated for Best Original Score at the 96th Academy Awards and Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media at the 66th Annual Grammy Awards, with Williams winning a Grammy for Best Instrumental Composition for \"Helena's Theme\".\nIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny premiered out of competition at the 76th Cannes Film Festival on May 18, 2023, and was theatrically released in the United States on June 30, by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. The film received mixed reviews, and grossed $384 million worldwide, becoming a box-office bomb due to a lack of wide audience appeal and being one of the most expensive films ever made, with estimated losses of $143 million for Disney.","content":"#Plot\n#Cast\n#Production\n##Development\n##Pre-production\n##Casting\n##Filming\n##Visual effects\n###De-aging\n##Music\n#Themes and influences\n#Release\n##Marketing\n##Theatrical\n##Home media\n#Reception\n##Box office\n##Critical response\n##Accolades\n#Future\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Cornel_Țăranu","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cornel_Țăranu","summary":"Cornel Țăranu ([korˈnel t͡səˈranu]; 20 June 1934 – 18 June 2023) was a Romanian classical composer, musicologist, conductor and cultural manager. A native of Cluj-Napoca in Transylvania, he was always attached to this region, and contributed to cultural cooperation between Romanian and ethnic Hungarian musicians. He studied locally, at the Cluj Academy, assimilating the local avatar of neoclassicism, alongside influences from Romanian folk music—though his debut years also evidenced conformity with Socialist Realism, he was reportedly censured by the communist regime for keeping company with sidelined figures, such as the poet Lucian Blaga. A teacher at his alma mater, he furthered his studies abroad, at the Conservatoire de Paris, becoming an authority on, and posthumous disciple of, George Enescu. Braving controversy, he worked on completing unfinished scores by Enescu, including his Fifth Symphony and a musical poem, Strigoii. In parallel, he founded Cluj's Ars Nova, a chamber orchestra dedicated to contemporary classical music and performance art. \nȚăranu's main compositions focus on orchestral work; he wrote two operas, vocal music for soloists and choirs, and critically acclaimed film scores. His style transitioned into a postmodernism with expressionist tinges, used mainly in his shorter pieces, but remained largely neoclassical in his four symphonies. His personal project was a musical companion to modern Romanian literature, directing him to explore various other sources of inspiration. Depending on context, his contributions were informed by folklore (Romanian, Romani and Greek), Byzantine music, and jazz. He also produced a number of distinctly historicist pieces, which took inspiration from political or descriptive texts in the history of Transylvania. Achieving mainstream recognition in the 1980s, when he won the Koussevitzky Prize, Țăranu maintained his reputation after the Romanian Revolution of 1989. A Chevalier of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in 2002, he directed the music festival Cluj Modern, and was a long-serving vice president of the Union of Romanian Composers. His film work included collaborations with his brother-in law, director Nicolae Mărgineanu; he was also the son-in-law of psychologist Nicolae Mărgineanu Sr.","content":"#Biography\n##Early life and neoclassical debut\n##Paris studies and Ars Nova\n##Postmodernism and historicism\n##Old age\n#Selected works\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

The Centre Party won 16 seats, a loss of 10, while Estonia 200 won 14 seats, gaining representation in the Riigikogu. \nAfter the previous parliamentary election in 2019, the Centre Party, led by Jüri Ratas, formed a government with Ratas serving as prime minister. His government was brought down in January 2021 after a corruption investigation, and Kaja Kallas of the Reform Party formed a coalition government with the Centre Party, which collapsed in June 2022. Kallas then formed a government with Isamaa and the Social Democratic Party and remained in the position of prime minister. \nIn January 2023, the National Electoral Committee announced that nine political parties and ten individual candidates had registered to take part in the 2023 parliamentary election.

It is usually employed to supplement and to make alterations to the original will. By virtue of the Wills Act, 1953, a codicil is included within the definition of \"will.\"\nThe date of execution of a will is the date on which the will is signed. Before 1954, when the Wills Act, 1953 came into force, all provinces had their own legislation regulating the law of testate succession; now the Wills Act, 1953 has uniformed the law in this regard.\nWhen dealing with a will which may have been executed under suspicious circumstances, it is important to investigate whether the testator wanted to execute a will and whether he did so freely.\nOnce these requirements have been fulfilled, and once it has been established that the formalities have been complied with, the executor is appointed. He has to deal with the general winding-up of the estate.\nAdiation and repudiation form the basis of succession, as it is important to know whether a beneficiary adiates or repudiates a benefit before the executor can begin with the final liquidation and distribution of an estate.","content":"#Freedom of testation\n##Limitations\n###Illegal dispositions and those against public policy\n###Subdivision of agricultural land\n###Subdivision of mineral rights\n###Fideicommissum multiplex\n###Maintenance of surviving spouse\n###Maintenance and education of minor children\n###Pension funds\n##Delegation\n##Customary law\n#Testamentary capacity\n##Mental ability of the testator\n##Undue influence on the testator\n#Capacity to witness a will\n#Formalities for execution of a will\n##Requirements for a testamentary disposition\n##Methods of executing a valid will\n##Signing and signature\n##Certificate\n##Witnesses\n#Condonation\n#Invalid wills\n##Revocation\n###Right of revocation\n###Manner\n####Later will or codicil\n####Physical or symbolic destruction\n####Ademption\n####Other means of revocation\n####Divorce or annulment of marriage\n###Exceptions to the general rule that a will can be revoked\n###Revival of a revoked will\n##Alteration or variation\n###Amendment by testator\n###Rectification by court\n###Alteration or variation by the court\n##Incorporation by reference\n#Obsolete and provincial wills\n#Joint or mutual wills\n#Probate of wills\n##Lost wills\n#Content of wills\n##Inheritance and legacy\n##Prior and legal rights\n##Vested, conditional and future interests\n##Vested interests\n##Conditional interests\n###Future interests\n###Valid and invalid conditions\n##Nudum praeceptum\n##Estate massing\n##Customary law\n##Testamentary devices\n###Usufruct\n###Substitution\n####Direct substitution\n####Fideicommissary substitution\n###Difference between usufruct and fideicommissum\n###Fideicommissum residui\n###Fideicommissum purum\n###Trust\n##Bequests subject to a modus\n##Interpretation of some common dispositions in wills\n###Presumption against fideicommissa\n###Si sine liberis decesserit clause\n##Implied fideicommissa\n###Fideicommissum subject to a si sine liberis condition\n###Prohibitions against alienation\n##Statutory aids to interpretation\n##Combinations of various interests\n###Fideicommissum upon fideicommissum\n###Compendiosa substitutio\n###Ownership subject to a usufruct with a direct substitution as to the usufruct at the testator’s death\n###Ownership subject to a usufruct as to which there is a fideicommissary substitution\n###Ownership subject to a usufruct with a direct substitution as to the ownership at the testator’s death\n###Ownership subject to a usufruct with a direct substitution as to the ownership at the death of the usufructuary\n###Fideicommissum in which one fideicommissary is directly substituted for another\n#Effect of wills\n##Rights of heirs\n##Rights of legatees\n###Abatement of legacies\n##Rights of fiduciaries and fideicommissaries\n##Ius accrescendi\n###Express provision concerning accrual\n###No provision concerning accrual\n#References\n##Books\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"2022_Philippine_presidential_election","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2022_Philippine_presidential_election","summary":"The 2022 Philippine presidential and vice presidential elections were held on May 9, 2022, as part of the 2022 general election. This was the 17th direct presidential election and 16th vice presidential election in the Philippines since 1935, and the sixth sextennial presidential and vice presidential election since 1992.\nIncumbent president Rodrigo Duterte was ineligible for re-election because the president is limited to a single term under the 1987 Philippine Constitution. Incumbent vice president Leni Robredo was eligible for re-election but chose to run for the presidency instead. Therefore, this election determined the 17th president and the 15th vice president. The president and vice president are elected separately, so the two winning candidates can come from different political parties.\nThe election took place amidst the COVID-19 pandemic which had caused the country's economy to fall into recession. Other key issues were the continuation of President Duterte's policies, a re-examination of the country's foreign relationships in response to its territorial dispute with China, management of the country's debt, rising inflation, and climate change.\nThe ticket of former senator Bongbong Marcos and Davao City mayor Sara Duterte won the presidency and vice presidency respectively, defeating incumbent vice president Leni Robredo and incumbent senator Francis Pangilinan in a landslide. It was the first election since the establishment of the Fifth Republic in 1987 where the president and vice president were elected by a majority, and the first election since 2004 where the winning president and vice president came from the same presidential ticket. The election saw the highest turnout since 1998, with about 56 million voters participating. Marcos received 31.6 million votes, the most votes ever cast for a candidate in a presidential election in the Philippines, while Duterte received 32.2 million votes, the most votes ever cast for a candidate in the country.\nMarcos became the second president from Ilocos Norte after his father, former president \nFerdinand Marcos, while Duterte became the first vice president from Davao City and the youngest to be elected. This also marked the return of the Marcos family to power for the first time since the People Power Revolution. Marcos was inaugurated on June 30, 2022, while Duterte was inaugurated earlier on June 19, 2022.","content":"#Background\n#Electoral system\n#Candidates\n##Ernesto Abella (Independent)\n##Leody de Guzman (PLM)\n###Walden Bello (PLM)\n##Norberto Gonzales (PDSP)\n##Panfilo Lacson (Independent)\n###Tito Sotto (NPC)\n##Faisal Mangondato (Katipunan)\n###Carlos Serapio (Katipunan)\n##Bongbong Marcos (PFP)\n###Sara Duterte (Lakas)\n##Jose Montemayor Jr. (DPP)\n###Rizalito David (DPP)\n##Isko Moreno (Aksyon)\n###Willie Ong (Aksyon)\n##Manny Pacquiao (PROMDI)\n###Lito Atienza (PROMDI)\n##Leni Robredo (Independent)\n###Francis Pangilinan (Liberal)\n##Standalone vice presidential candidate\n###Manny Lopez (WPP)\n#Debates and forums\n##Presidential debates and forums\n##Vice presidential debates\n#Opinion polling\n##For president\n##For vice president\n#Campaign\n##Issues\n##Start of campaign period for national positions\n##Start of campaign period for local positions\n##Miting de avance\n#Results\n##For president\n###Result by island group and region\n##For vice president\n###Result by island group and region\n##Results per province, city, diplomatic post and absentee voting category\n###Close places\n###Landslides\n###Swing in Vote Share\n##Unofficial tallies\n#Aftermath\n##Election night\n##Concessions\n##Protests\n##International reactions\n","lang":"en"}

An Executive Summary of the committee's findings was published on December 19, 2022; a Final Report was published on December 22, 2022.\nDuring the first hearing on June 9, 2022, committee chair Bennie Thompson and vice-chair Liz Cheney said that President Donald Trump tried to stay in power even though he lost the 2020 presidential election. Thompson called it a \"coup\". The committee shared footage of the attack, discussed the involvement of the Proud Boys, and included testimony from a documentary filmmaker and a member of the Capitol Police.\nThe second hearing on June 13, 2022, focused on evidence showing that Trump knew he lost and that most of his inner circle knew claims of fraud did not have merit. William Barr testified that Trump had \"become detached from reality\" because he continued to promote conspiracy theories and pushed the stolen election myth without \"interest in what the actual facts were.\"\nThe third hearing on June 16, 2022, examined how Trump and others pressured Vice President Mike Pence to selectively discount electoral votes and overturn the election by unconstitutional means, using John Eastman's fringe legal theories as justification.\nThe fourth hearing on June 21, 2022, included appearances by election officials from Arizona and Georgia who testified they were pressured to \"find votes\" for Trump and change results in their jurisdictions. The committee revealed attempts to organize fake slates of alternate electors and established that \"Trump had a direct and personal role in this effort.\"\nThe fifth hearing on June 23, 2022, focused on Trump's pressure campaign on the Justice Department to rubber stamp his narrative of a stolen election, the insistence on numerous debunked election fraud conspiracy theories, requests to seize voting machines, and Trump's effort to install Jeffrey Clark as acting attorney general.\nThe exclusive witness of the sixth hearing on June 28, 2022, was Cassidy Hutchinson, top aide to former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows. She testified that White House officials anticipated violence days in advance of January 6; that Trump knew supporters at the Ellipse rally were armed with weapons including AR-15s yet asked to relax security checks at his speech; and that Trump planned to join the crowd at the Capitol and became irate when the Secret Service refused his request. Closing the hearing, Cheney presented evidence of witness tampering.\nThe seventh hearing on July 12, 2022, showed how Roger Stone and Michael Flynn connected Trump to domestic militias like the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys that helped coordinate the attack.\nThe eighth hearing on July 21, 2022, presented evidence and details of Trump's refusal to call off the attack on the Capitol, despite hours of pleas from officials and insiders. According to the New York Times, the committee delivered two significant public messages: Rep. Liz Cheney made the case that Trump could never \"be trusted with any position of authority in our great nation again\", while Rep. Bennie Thompson called for legal \"accountability\" and \"stiff consequences\" to \"overcome the ongoing threat to our democracy.\"\nThe ninth hearing on October 13, 2022, presented video of Roger Stone and evidence that some Trump associates planned to claim victory in the 2020 election regardless of the official results. The committee voted unanimously to subpoena Trump for documents and testimony, and a subpoena was issued one week later. Trump refused to comply.\nThe tenth hearing on December 19, 2022, convened to present a final overview of their investigative work to date, and the committee recommended that former President Donald Trump, John Eastman, and others be referred for legal charges. The committee also recommended that the House Ethics Committee follow up on Rep. Kevin McCarthy (CA), Rep. Jim Jordan (OH), Scott Perry (PA), and Andy Biggs (AZ) refusing to answer subpoenas. The votes were unanimous. Immediately after the hearing, the committee released a 154-page executive summary of its findings.","content":"#Schedule\n#Background\n#Preliminary hearing – July 27, 2021\n##Participants\n##Synopsis of preliminary hearing\n#First hearing – June 9, 2022 – Primetime\n##Participants\n##Synopsis of first hearing\n###Opening statements by the panel members\n###Trump knew that he lost\n###Rush to issue presidential pardons\n###Attack on the Capitol\n###Pence called for the National Guard\n#Second hearing – June 13, 2022\n##Participants\n##Synopsis of second hearing\n###Witness testimony\n###Subpoena and absence of Bill Stepien\n###Knowledgeable insiders dismiss voter fraud allegations\n###False claims appeared in Trump fundraising\n#Third hearing – June 16, 2022\n##Participants\n##Synopsis of third hearing\n###Experts testimony on the Constitutional role of the Vice President in the election\n###Narrative of Vice President Pence and the events of January 6\n###Luttig warns about 2024\n#Fourth hearing – June 21, 2022\n##Participants\n##Synopsis of fourth hearing\n###Trump calls the Georgia Secretary of State\n###Surrogates pressured the Arizona House leadership\n###Sean Riley \"alternate electors\" plan for Wisconsin and Michigan\n###Impact of false fraud allegations on election workers\n###Reactions to fourth hearing\n#Fifth hearing – June 23, 2022\n##Participants\n##Synopsis of fifth hearing\n###\"Just say it was corrupt\"\n###Aborted attempt to install Jeffrey Clark as Attorney General\n###Request for preemptive pardons\n#Sixth hearing – June 28, 2022\n##Participants\n##Synopsis of sixth hearing\n###Prelude to January 6\n###Hutchinson account of January 6\n###Immediate January 6 aftermath\n###Rep.

{"title":"DC_Universe_(franchise)","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/DC_Universe_(franchise)","summary":"The DC Universe (DCU) is an upcoming American media franchise and shared universe based on characters from DC Comics publications. It was created by James Gunn and Peter Safran, co-chairmen and co-CEOs of DC Studios. The franchise is a soft reboot of the DC Extended Universe (DCEU), a previous franchise featuring DC characters. The DCU retains certain DCEU cast members while replacing others. In contrast with the previous state of DC Comics adaptations, the DCU features a united continuity and story across live-action films and television, animation, and video games. Concurrent DC adaptations that do not fit within this continuity are labeled \"DC Elseworlds\".\nAfter Discovery, Inc. and WarnerMedia merged to become Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), CEO David Zaslav revealed a plan to revitalize the DC brand following the poor reception of some DCEU films. Gunn and Safran were hired to lead the newly formed DC Studios in November 2022 after working on several DCEU projects, including the film The Suicide Squad (2021) and its spin-off series, Peacemaker (2022–present). The pair spent several months with a group of writers developing the overarching story for a new DC continuity, which features a combination of popular and obscure DC characters. Some DCEU projects in development were abandoned in favor of new takes, while others (including Peacemaker) continued within the new franchise. Gunn and Safran wanted to focus on storytelling needs rather than forcing creators to produce their projects before specific release dates.\nThe story of the DCU is divided into chapters, starting with \"Gods and Monsters\", which will begin in 2024 with the animated series Creature Commandos. Gunn and Safran consider the chapter's first film, Superman (2025), to be the true beginning of the DCU.","content":"#Background\n##DC Extended Universe\n##Warner Bros.

{"title":"The_Chromatica_Ball","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Chromatica_Ball","summary":"The Chromatica Ball was the seventh headlining concert tour by American singer Lady Gaga in support of her sixth studio album, Chromatica (2020). Comprising 20 shows, it began on July 17, 2022, in Düsseldorf and concluded on September 17, 2022, in Miami Gardens. Initially conceived as a six-date-long, limited tour, new dates were added after it was delayed by two years due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIt is Gaga's first all-stadium concert tour and features a stage inspired by brutalist architecture. In line with the promoted album's themes, the show's narrative depicts a journey around trauma and healing. It is divided into distinct segments, each separated by a video introduction and a costume change. Gaga opted for a \"darker, edgier\" appearance for the tour in contrast to the pink cyberpunk look from Chromatica's earlier promotional imagery; her wardrobe included outfits by designers she frequently worked with in the past, such as Alexander McQueen, Gareth Pugh, and her sister, Natali Germanotta.\nThe tour received critical acclaim, with various outlets rating it with the highest score in their respective reviews. Critics praised the visuals, the choreography, Gaga's vocal skills, and many of them singled out the piano segment as the concert's strongest part. On numerous American dates, Gaga interpolated political statements to her piano performances, addressing topics such as gun violence and abortion rights. According to Billboard Boxscore, The Chromatica Ball ultimately grossed $112.4 million from 834,000 tickets sold, breaking multiple personal attendance records and venue records. Gaga's September 2022 show at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles was recorded for a special, which was released on May 25, 2024, on HBO and Max.","content":"#Background and development\n#Production\n##Conception and stage setup\n##Costume design\n#Concert synopsis\n#Critical reception\n##Europe\n##North America\n##Asia\n#Commercial performance\n#Political commentary\n#Concert film\n#Set list\n##Notes\n#Shows\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

These are known as First Period houses of the early to mid–second generation as they were built by the children of the first settlers in the Massachusetts Bay colony. During this time, buildings in New England were increasingly designed and built by regionally trained carpenters and were only occasionally influenced by new immigrant craftsmen. These structures have highly decorated wooden frames and are structurally more complex than the previous surviving generation of houses. While many existing homes are thought to have been built between 1660 and 1679, scientifically proving their age is another matter. Of the 78 houses on this list, just 11 have been proven through dendrochronology.  The rest of the examples are approximate (indicated with a \"circa\" or \"c.\") and based on architectural studies and historical records. Only First-period houses built before 1679 by the second generation are suitable for inclusion on this list.\nAll entries should include citations concerning 17th-century architectural features, a report by an architectural historian, or dendrochronology whenever possible. The houses on this list are limited to extant structures preferably with remaining 17th-century architecture.

{"title":"Raquel_Welch","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Raquel_Welch","summary":"Jo Raquel Welch (née Tejada; September 5, 1940 – February 15, 2023) was an American actress. Welch first gained attention for her role in Fantastic Voyage (1966), after which she signed a long-term contract with 20th Century Fox. They lent her contract to the British studio Hammer Film Productions, for whom she made One Million Years B.C. (1966). Although Welch had only three lines of dialogue in the film, images of her in the doe-skin bikini became bestselling posters that turned her into an international sex symbol. She later starred in Bedazzled (1967), Bandolero! (1968), 100 Rifles (1969), Myra Breckinridge (1970), Hannie Caulder (1971), Kansas City Bomber (1972), The Last of Sheila (1973), The Three Musketeers (1973), The Wild Party (1975), and Mother, Jugs & Speed (1976). She made several television variety specials.\nThrough her portrayal of strong female characters, helping her break the mold of the traditional sex symbol, Welch developed a unique film persona that made her an icon of the 1960s and 1970s. Her rise to stardom in the mid-1960s was partly credited with ending Hollywood's vigorous promotion of the blonde bombshell. Her love scene with Jim Brown in 100 Rifles also made cinematic history with their portrayal of interracial intimacy. She won a Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture Actress in a Musical or Comedy in 1974 for her performance as Constance Bonacieux in The Three Musketeers and reprised the role in its sequel the following year. She was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in Television Film for her performance in Right to Die (1987). Her final film was How to Be a Latin Lover (2017).

The service features integration with Instagram and users must register for Threads with an Instagram account.  Functionally it is similar to Twitter: users can post text, images, voice recordings, and videos, as well as interact with other users' posts through replies, reposts, and likes. The application is available on iOS and Android devices; the web version offers limited functionality and requires a mobile app to be installed first. Upon its launch, Threads became the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users in its first five days and surpassing the record previously set by ChatGPT. This early success was not sustained, and the user base of the app plummeted more than 80% to 8 million daily active users by the end of July 2023.\nAfter Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter in October 2022, Meta employees explored the concept of introducing text-based functionality to Instagram. This feature, known as Instagram Notes, was rolled out in December 2022. The company subsequently began developing a separate app focused on text-based posts. Development on Threads—internally known as \"Project 92\"—commenced in January 2023, with the platform officially launching on July 5, 2023. Threads immediately became available in 100 countries (out of 193 UN member states), but until December 14, 2023 had delayed its launch in the European Union as it waited for regulatory clarity from the European Commission regarding the service's data collection policies.","content":"#History\n##Predecessor\n##Development and announcement\n##Launch\n#Appearance and features\n##Possibility of open interoperability\n##Account integration with Instagram\n##Device compatibility\n##Censorship attempts\n##Advertising\n#Userbase\n##Decline in the months after launch\n##Popularity in Taiwan\n#Responses\n##Intellectual property dispute\n##Data privacy\n##State media\n##Imitating other platforms\n#See also\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

Movie is a 2023 American animated adventure comedy film based on Nintendo's Mario video game franchise. Produced by Universal Pictures, Illumination, and Nintendo, and distributed by Universal, it was directed by Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic (in the latter's feature directorial debut) and written by Matthew Fogel. The ensemble voice cast includes Chris Pratt, Anya Taylor-Joy, Charlie Day, Jack Black, Keegan-Michael Key, Seth Rogen, and Fred Armisen. The film features an origin story for the brothers Mario and Luigi, Italian-American plumbers who are separated after being transported to a fantasy world and become entangled in a battle between the Mushroom Kingdom, led by Princess Peach, and the Koopas, led by Bowser.\nAfter the critical and commercial failure of the live-action film Super Mario Bros. (1993), Nintendo became reluctant to license its intellectual properties for film adaptations. Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto became interested in developing another film during the development of the Virtual Console service. Through Nintendo's work with Universal Parks & Resorts to create Super Nintendo World, he met with Illumination CEO Chris Meledandri. By 2016, they were discussing a Mario film and, in January 2018, Nintendo announced that it would produce it with Illumination and Universal. Production was underway by 2020, and the cast was announced in September 2021.\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie premiered at Regal LA Live in Los Angeles on April 1, 2023, and was released in the United States on April 5. Although it received mixed reviews from critics, the film grossed $1.36 billion worldwide and broke multiple box-office records, including the biggest worldwide opening weekend for an animated film, the highest grossing film based on a video game, and the first film based on a video game to gross over $1 billion. It also became the second-highest-grossing film of 2023, the third-highest-grossing animated film, and the highest-grossing film produced by Illumination. At the 81st Golden Globe Awards, the film received three nominations: Best Animated Feature Film, Best Original Song, and Cinematic Box Office Achievement, a category newly introduced at the same ceremony. A sequel is set to be released on April 3, 2026.","content":"#Plot\n#Voice cast\n#Production\n##Development\n##Writing\n##Casting\n##Animation and design\n##Music\n#Marketing\n#Release\n##Theatrical\n##Home media\n##Internet leak\n#Reception\n##Box office\n###Domestic\n###Other territories\n##Critical response\n##Accolades\n#Future\n##Sequel\n##Possible spin-offs\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

It stars Amber Midthunder, Dakota Beavers, Dane DiLiegro, Michelle Thrush, Stormee Kipp, Julian Black Antelope, and Bennett Taylor. The story revolves around a young Comanche woman, Naru, who is striving to prove herself as a hunter.

Sergey Karjakin was originally a qualifier, but was disqualified for breaching the FIDE Code of Ethics after publicly expressing approval of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Karjakin was replaced by Ding, the highest-rated player who had not yet qualified.\nNepomniachtchi won the tournament undefeated with a round to spare and the highest score in any Candidates tournament since the modern format was introduced in 2013. This made him one of five players to win consecutive Candidates, the others being Vasily Smyslov, Boris Spassky, Viktor Korchnoi, and Anatoly Karpov. (Of these, only Smyslov and Nepomniachtchi achieved this when the Candidates were organised as a tournament, rather than a series of matches.) Ding ended up in second place, having pulled off a last-round victory against Nakamura who failed to hold the game to a draw that would have seen him finish in second place instead.\nNepomniachtchi was scheduled to play a match against Magnus Carlsen for the World Chess Championship.

{"title":"Effects_of_climate_change","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Effects_of_climate_change","summary":"Effects of climate change are well documented and growing for  Earth's natural environment and human societies. Changes to the climate system include an overall warming trend, changes to precipitation patterns, and more extreme weather. As the climate changes it impacts the natural environment with effects such as more intense forest fires, thawing permafrost, and desertification. These changes impact ecosystems and societies, and can become irreversible once tipping points are crossed.  Climate activists are engaged in a range of activities around the world that seek to ameliorate these issues or prevent them from happening. \nThe effects of climate change vary in timing and location. Up until now the Arctic has warmed faster than most other regions due to climate change feedbacks. Surface air temperatures over land have also increased at about twice the rate they do over the ocean, causing intense heat waves. These temperatures would stabilize if greenhouse gas emissions were brought under control. Ice sheets and oceans absorb the vast majority of excess heat in the atmosphere, delaying effects there but causing them to accelerate and then continue after surface temperatures stabilize. Sea level rise is a particular long term concern as a result. The effects of ocean warming also include marine heatwaves, ocean stratification, deoxygenation, and changes to ocean currents.: 10  The ocean is also acidifying as it absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.  \n\nThe ecosystems most immediately threatened by climate change are in the mountains, coral reefs, and the Arctic. Excess heat is causing environmental changes in those locations that exceed the ability of animals to adapt. Species are escaping heat by migrating towards the poles and to higher ground when they can. Sea level rise threatens coastal wetlands with flooding. Decreases in soil moisture in certain locations can cause desertification and damage ecosystems like the Amazon Rainforest.: 9  At 2 °C (3.6 °F) of warming, around 10% of species on land would become critically endangered.: 259 \nHumans are vulnerable to climate change in many ways. Sources of food and fresh water can be threatened by environmental changes. Human health can be impacted by weather extremes or by ripple effects like the spread of infectious diseases. Economic impacts include changes to agriculture, fisheries, and forestry. Higher temperatures will increasingly prevent outdoor labor in tropical latitudes due to heat stress. Island nations and coastal cities may be inundated by rising sea levels. Some groups of people may be particularly at risk from climate change, such as the poor, children, and indigenous peoples. Industrialised countries, which have emitted the vast majority of CO2, have more resources to adapt to global warming than developing nations do. Cumulative effects and extreme weather events can lead to displacement and migration.","content":"#Changes in temperature\n#Weather\n##Heat waves and temperature extremes\n##Rain\n##Extreme storms\n#Land\n##Floods\n##Droughts\n##Wildfires\n#Oceans\n##Sea level rise\n#Ice and snow\n##Glaciers decline\n##Ice sheets decline\n##Sea ice decline\n##Permafrost thawing\n#Wildlife and nature\n##Ecosystems on land\n##Marine ecosystems\n#Tipping points and irreversible impacts\n#Health, food security and water security\n##Health\n##Food security\n##Water security\n#Human settlements\n##Impacts from heat\n##Low-lying coastal regions\n#Impacts on societies\n##Displacement and migration\n##Conflict\n##Social impacts on vulnerable groups\n##Possibility of societal collapse\n#Economic impacts\n##Economic inequality\n##Highly affected sectors\n#See also\n#References\n##Sources\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Dimitrie_Stelaru","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dimitrie_Stelaru","summary":"Dimitrie Stelaru (pen name of Dumitru Petrescu, later formalized as Petrescu-Stelaru; 8 March 1917 – 28 November 1971) was a Romanian avant-garde poet, novelist, playwright, and bohemian figure. Originating from the rural area of Teleorman County, he was paternally orphaned at birth, in the Romanian campaign of World War I. He was adopted by a bricklayer from Turnu Măgurele, who turned the boy toward the Seventh-day Adventist Church and forced him to undergo religious education. In his adolescence, Stelaru rebelled against this upbringing, and took up poetry—initially Christian-themed or Neo-romantic in content. He became a habitual vagrant, taking up jobs from porter and stevedore to coal miner. His youth is hard to reconstruct, due to patchy records and Stelaru's own passion for autofiction; it is however known that he lived in extreme poverty in Bucharest, romantically involved with a tuberculosis-stricken woman, who became the focus of his early love poems.\nDespite his own pedigree within the precariat, Stelaru shunned proletarian literature in the 1930s; his only influence from left-wing culture was Panait Istrati, who became one of his favorite writers. While preserving the trappings of Neo-romanticism, and drawing heavily from Edgar Allan Poe, he sometimes embraced an extreme form of literary naturalism, and slid into literary Expressionism. The ethereal qualities of his poetic imagery, meanwhile, were informed by his familiarity with Surrealism, to which he also introduced his writer friend, Constant Tonegaru. Stelaru himself was discovered by fellow poet Eugen Jebeleanu, and became the focus of veneration by the younger writers. By 1944, he had built up a literary network which included Jebeleanu, Tonegaru, Geo Dumitrescu, Ion Caraion, Pavel Chihaia, Ben Corlaciu, Mihu Dragomir, and Miron Radu Paraschivescu. His contribution as a poet bridged the gap between the older modernists at Sburătorul (where he was personally welcomed by Eugen Lovinescu) and avant-garde circles, including Albatros and Adonis.\nExperiencing literary fame by the start of World War II, Stelaru amused himself by staging his own death in 1940. Over the following years, he tried to slide back into vagrancy and obscurity, as a draft evader. Upon the war's end, he reemerged as an art teacher in Sighișoara, and made a brief return to publishing. Such projects were ended with the rise of a communist regime in 1947; Stelaru embraced proletarian themes, but abhorred the guidelines of Socialist Realism. He and Chihaia unsuccessfully tried to defect as stowaways, from Constanța Port. The regime reciprocated his disdain with a ban on his work, also preventing him from even joining the Writers' Union of Romania. Stelaru lived out the ban as an unemployed man in Turnu Măgurele, but was slowly reinstated in the mid-1950s, when he was allowed to publish modern fairy tales and works of children's drama. Again lambasted in 1958, he was finally recovered and progressively rehabilitated in the early 1960s.\nReturning to his work and formally consecrated by the Writers' Union, Stelaru was also given his first permanent home—an apartment in Berceni, where he lived with his third wife and second child. Between 1967 and 1971, he produced a large corpus of poetry and prose, including new plays which echoed Absurdism. He was then physically incapacitated by cirrhosis, which ultimately killed him in November 1971. His work was again ignored, then rediscovered in the mid-to-late 1980s; by then, his descendants had split between Romania and West Germany.","content":"#Biography\n##Early life\n##Debut and death-hoax\n##Albatros years\n##Antonescu-era repression and late 1940s\n##Censoring and obscurity\n##Final return\n#Legacy\n#Notes\n#References\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Elizabeth_II","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Elizabeth_II","summary":"Elizabeth II (Elizabeth Alexandra Mary; 21 April 1926 – 8 September 2022) was Queen of the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth realms from 6 February 1952 until her death in 2022. She had been queen regnant of 32 sovereign states during her lifetime and was the monarch of 15 realms at her death. Her reign of 70 years and 214 days is the longest of any British monarch and the second-longest of any sovereign state.\nElizabeth was born in Mayfair, London, during the reign of her paternal grandfather, King George V. She was the first child of the Duke and Duchess of York (later King George VI and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother). Her father acceded to the throne in 1936 upon the abdication of his brother Edward VIII, making the ten-year-old Princess Elizabeth the heir presumptive. She was educated privately at home and began to undertake public duties during the Second World War, serving in the Auxiliary Territorial Service. In November 1947, she married Philip Mountbatten, a former prince of Greece and Denmark. Their marriage lasted 73 years until his death in 2021. They had four children: Charles, Anne, Andrew, and Edward.\nWhen her father died in February 1952, Elizabeth, then 25 years old, became queen of seven independent Commonwealth countries: the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Pakistan, and Ceylon (known today as Sri Lanka), as well as head of the Commonwealth. Elizabeth reigned as a constitutional monarch through major political changes such as the Troubles in Northern Ireland, devolution in the United Kingdom, the decolonisation of Africa, and the United Kingdom's accession to the European Communities as well as its subsequent withdrawal. The number of her realms varied over time as territories gained independence and some realms became republics. As queen, Elizabeth was served by more than 170 prime ministers across her realms. Her many historic visits and meetings included state visits to China in 1986, to Russia in 1994, and to the Republic of Ireland in 2011, and meetings with five popes and fourteen US presidents.\nSignificant events included her coronation in 1953 and the celebrations of her Silver, Golden, Diamond, and Platinum jubilees. Although there was occasional republican sentiment and media criticism of her family—particularly after the breakdowns of her children's marriages, her annus horribilis in 1992, and the death in 1997 of her former daughter-in-law Diana—support for the monarchy and her personal popularity in the United Kingdom remained consistently high. Elizabeth died aged 96 at Balmoral Castle, and was succeeded by her eldest son, Charles III.","content":"#Early life\n#Heir presumptive\n##Second World War\n##Marriage\n#Reign\n##Accession and coronation\n##Early reign\n##Political reforms and crises\n##Perils and dissent\n##Turbulent years\n##Dawn of the new millennium\n##Diamond Jubilee and milestones\n##Pandemic and widowhood\n##Platinum Jubilee and beyond\n#Death\n#Legacy\n##Beliefs, activities, and interests\n##Media depiction and public opinion\n#Titles, styles, honours, and arms\n##Titles and styles\n##Arms\n#Issue\n#Ancestry\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n##Citations\n##Bibliography\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

Letby came under investigation following a high number of unexpected infant deaths which occurred at the neonatal unit of the Countess of Chester Hospital three years after she began working there.\nLetby was charged in November 2020 with seven counts of murder and fifteen counts of attempted murder in relation to seventeen babies. She pleaded not guilty. Prosecution evidence included Letby's presence at a high number of deaths, two abnormal blood test results and skin discolouration interpreted as diagnostics of insulin poisoning and air embolism, inconsistencies in medical records, Letby’s removal of nursing handover sheets from the hospital, and her behaviour and communications, including handwritten notes interpreted as a confession. In August 2023, Letby was found guilty on seven counts each of murder and attempted murder. She was found not guilty on two counts of attempted murder and the jury could not reach a verdict on the remaining six counts. A murder charge in which the jury failed to find a verdict was retried in July 2024; she pleaded not guilty and was convicted. Letby was sentenced to life imprisonment with a whole life order. \nManagement at the Countess of Chester Hospital were criticised for ignoring warnings about Letby. The British government commissioned an independent statutory inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the deaths, which began its hearings in September 2024. Letby is under investigation for further cases.\nSince the conclusion of her trials, after an embargo on certain reporting was lifted, experts have expressed doubts about the safety of her convictions due to contention over medical and statistical evidence, technical errors (including mislabelled door swipe data), and motive. Medical professionals contested the interpreted diagnostics as \"not sufficient\" for criminal evidentiary use and \"implausible\", arguing the autopsies indicated the infants had died of natural causes. Applications for appeal of a new trial have been rejected by the Court of Appeal for a failure to meet the admission criteria for new evidence.","content":"#Early life and education\n#Career\n#Initial investigations\n#2023 trial\n##Evidence\n###Handwritten notes\n###Medical records\n##Letby's testimony\n##Defence arguments\n##Verdicts and sentencing\n#Motives\n#Post-conviction\n##Disciplinary action\n##Appeal\n##Retrial\n##Further investigations\n##Thirlwall inquiry\n#Reactions\n##Calls for regulation and reform\n#Safety of the convictions\n##Concerns about the medical evidence\n###Insulin\n###Air via nasogastric tube\n###Air embolism\n##Quality of the statistical evidence\n##Staff and infrastructure issues\n##Timeline\n###X-ray timing\n###Mislabelled door swipe data\n##Interpretation of handwritten notes\n##Criticism of witnesses\n##Reaction to doubt\n#See also\n","lang":"en"}

Initial reporting on the incident (informed by police statements) was later contradicted by a video posted online, which led to widespread protests and riots. Symbols of the state such as town halls, schools, police stations, and other buildings were attacked. The Interior Ministry reported that more than 5,000 vehicles had been set on fire, along with 10,000 garbage cans; nearly 1,000 buildings had been burnt, damaged or looted; 250 police stations and gendarmeries had been attacked; and more than 700 police officers had been injured.\nThe killing—condemned by President Emmanuel Macron as \"inexplicable\" and \"inexcusable\"—became part of a broader public debate regarding aggressive French law enforcement, racial profiling,  immigration, and the stakes of naming the suburban violence a \"riot\" rather than a \"revolt\".

{"title":"Fenwick_tree","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fenwick_tree","summary":"A Fenwick tree or binary indexed tree (BIT) is a data structure that can efficiently update values and calculate prefix sums in an array of values.\nThis structure was proposed by Boris Ryabko in 1989\nwith a further modification published in 1992.\nIt has subsequently become known under the name Fenwick tree after Peter Fenwick, who described this structure in his 1994 article.\nWhen compared with a flat array of values, the Fenwick tree achieves a much better balance between two operations: value update and prefix sum calculation. A flat array of \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n}\n  \n values can either store the values or the prefix sums.

Robert Oppenheimer (born Julius Robert Oppenheimer;  OP-ən-hy-mər; April 22, 1904 – February 18, 1967) was an American theoretical physicist who served as the director of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory during World War II. He is often called the \"father of the atomic bomb\" for his role in overseeing the development of the first nuclear weapons.\nBorn in New York City, Oppenheimer obtained a degree in chemistry from Harvard University in 1925 and a doctorate in physics from the University of Göttingen in Germany in 1927, studying under Max Born. After research at other institutions, he joined the physics faculty at the University of California, Berkeley, where he was made a full professor in 1936. Oppenheimer made significant contributions to physics in the fields of quantum mechanics and nuclear physics, including the Born–Oppenheimer approximation for molecular wave functions; work on the theory of positrons, quantum electrodynamics, and quantum field theory; and the Oppenheimer–Phillips process in nuclear fusion. With his students, he also made major contributions to astrophysics, including the theory of cosmic ray showers, and the theory of neutron stars and black holes.\nIn 1942, Oppenheimer was recruited to work on the Manhattan Project, and in 1943 was appointed director of the project's Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico, tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons. His leadership and scientific expertise were instrumental in the project's success. On July 16, 1945, he was present at the first test of the atomic bomb, Trinity. In August 1945, the weapons were used against Japan in the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, to date the only use of nuclear weapons in an armed conflict.\nIn 1947, Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, and chairman of the General Advisory Committee of the new United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC). He lobbied for international control of nuclear power to avert nuclear proliferation and a nuclear arms race with the Soviet Union, and opposed the development of the hydrogen bomb, partly on ethical grounds. During the second Red Scare, these stances, together with his past associations with the Communist Party USA, led to an AEC security hearing in 1954 and the revocation of his security clearance. He continued to lecture, write, and work in physics, and in 1963 was given the Enrico Fermi Award as a gesture of political rehabilitation. In 2022, the U.S. government vacated the 1954 revocation of his security clearance.","content":"#Early life\n##Childhood and education\n##Studies in Europe\n#Early career\n##Teaching\n##Scientific work\n#Private and political life\n##Politics\n##Relationships and children\n##Mysticism\n#Manhattan Project\n##Los Alamos\n##Bomb design\n##Trinity\n#Postwar activities\n##Institute for Advanced Study\n##Atomic Energy Commission\n##Panels and study groups\n##Security hearing\n#Final years\n##Enrico Fermi Award\n#Death\n#Legacy\n#Publications\n#Notes\n#References\n#Sources\n#Further reading\n##Articles\n##Books\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}
{"title":"2022_Wimbledon_Championships_–_Men's_singles","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2022_Wimbledon_Championships_–_Men's_singles","summary":"Three-time defending champion Novak Djokovic defeated Nick Kyrgios in the final, 4–6, 6–3, 6–4, 7–6(7–3) to win the gentlemen's singles tennis title at the 2022 Wimbledon Championships. It was his seventh Wimbledon title and 21st major singles title overall. Djokovic became the fifth man in the Open Era to record a streak of at least four consecutive titles at one major. By reaching his 32nd men's singles major final, he surpassed Roger Federer's all-time record. Djokovic also became the first player (male or female) to win 80 matches at all four majors with his first-round win over Kwon Soon-woo. Because the ATP decided not to award ranking points in response to Wimbledon's banning of Russian and Belarusian players, Djokovic dropped out of the top five in the ATP rankings after winning the tournament.\nKyrgios became the first unseeded man to reach a major final since Jo-Wilfried Tsonga at the 2008 Australian Open, the first Australian man to reach a major final since Lleyton Hewitt at the 2005 Australian Open, and the first unseeded Australian man to reach the Wimbledon final since Mark Philippoussis in 2003.\nRafael Nadal was attempting to complete the third component of a prospective Grand Slam, but withdrew before his semifinal match against Kyrgios due to a torn abdominal muscle. It was the first time a man had withdrawn from a Wimbledon semifinal or final since Frank Shields in 1931. Cameron Norrie became the fourth British man in the Open Era (after Roger Taylor, Tim Henman, and Andy Murray) to reach the semifinals. It was the first time two left-handed men (Norrie and Nadal) had reached the semifinals since John McEnroe and Goran Ivanišević in 1992, and to the semifinals of any major since Nadal and Jürgen Melzer at the 2010 French Open. This was also Nadal's final professional appearance at Wimbledon.\nThis was the first edition of Wimbledon to feature a champions tiebreak (10-point tiebreak), when the score reaches six games all in the fifth set, and the third edition to feature a final set tiebreak. Alejandro Davidovich Fokina defeated Hubert Hurkacz in the first round in the first main-draw 10-point tiebreak at Wimbledon. It was also the first Wimbledon since the introduction of the ATP rankings in 1973, and the first major since the 1999 Australian Open, where both the reigning world No. 1 and No. 2 (Daniil Medvedev and Alexander Zverev, respectively) did not compete; Medvedev was prohibited from playing due to his Russian nationality, while Zverev was recovering from an ankle injury sustained at the French Open. This marked the first edition of Wimbledon since 1998 not to feature record eight-time champion Roger Federer, resulting in his dropping out of the ATP rankings for the first time since 1998 (Federer would retire from professional tennis later that year). Feliciano López made his 81st main-draw major appearance, tying Federer's all-time record. John Isner broke Ivo Karlović's world record of 13,728 career aces on the ATP Tour in his third-round match against Jannik Sinner.","content":"#Seeds\n#Draw\n##Key\n##Finals\n##Top half\n###Section 1\n###Section 2\n###Section 3\n###Section 4\n##Bottom half\n###Section 5\n###Section 6\n###Section 7\n###Section 8\n#Seeded players\n##Withdrawn players\n##Banned players\n#Other entry information\n##Wild cards\n##Protected ranking\n##Qualifiers\n##Lucky losers\n##Withdrawals\n#Explanatory notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Climate_change_mitigation","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Climate_change_mitigation","summary":"Climate change mitigation (or decarbonisation) is action to limit the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere that cause climate change. Climate change mitigation actions include conserving energy and replacing fossil fuels with clean energy sources. Secondary mitigation strategies include changes to land use and removing carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. Current climate change mitigation policies are insufficient as they would still result in global warming of about 2.7 °C by 2100, significantly above the 2015 Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global warming to below 2 °C.  \nSolar energy and wind power can replace fossil fuels at the lowest cost compared to other renewable energy options. The availability of sunshine and wind is variable and can require electrical grid upgrades, such as using long-distance electricity transmission to group a range of power sources. Energy storage can also be used to even out power output, and demand management can limit power use when power generation is low. Cleanly generated electricity can usually replace fossil fuels for powering transportation, heating buildings, and running industrial processes. Certain processes are more difficult to decarbonise, such as air travel and cement production. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) can be an option to reduce net emissions in these circumstances, although fossil fuel power plants with CCS technology is currently a high cost climate change mitigation strategy.\nHuman land use changes such as agriculture and deforestation cause about 1\/4th of climate change. These changes impact how much CO2 is absorbed by plant matter and how much organic matter decays or burns to release CO2. These changes are part of the fast carbon cycle, whereas fossil fuels release CO2 that was buried underground as part of the slow carbon cycle. Methane is a short lived greenhouse gas that is produced by decaying organic matter and livestock, as well as fossil fuel extraction. Land use changes can also impact precipitation patterns and the reflectivity of the surface of the Earth. It is possible to cut emissions from agriculture by reducing food waste, switching to a more plant-based diet (also referred to as low-carbon diet), and by improving farming processes.\nVarious policies can encourage climate change mitigation. Carbon pricing systems have been set up that either tax CO2 emissions or cap total emissions and trade emission credits. Fossil fuel subsidies can be eliminated in favor of clean energy subsidies, and incentives offered for installing energy efficiency measures or switching to electric power sources. Another issue is overcoming environmental objections when constructing new clean energy sources and making grid modifications.","content":"#Definitions and scope\n##Relationship with solar radiation modification (SRM)\n#Emission trends and pledges\n##Needed emissions cuts\n##Pledges\n#Low-carbon energy\n##Solar and wind energy\n##Other renewables\n##Integrating variable renewable energy\n##Nuclear power\n##Replacing coal with natural gas\n#Demand reduction\n##Energy conservation and efficiency\n##Lifestyle changes\n##Dietary change\n##Family size\n#Preserving and enhancing carbon sinks\n##Forests\n###Conservation\n###Afforestation and reforestation\n##Soils\n##Wetlands\n##Deep ocean\n##Enhanced weathering\n#Other methods to capture and store CO2\n#Mitigation by sector\n##Buildings\n##Urban planning\n##Transport\n###Shipping\n###Air transport\n##Agriculture, forestry and land use\n##Industry\n#Co-benefits\n##Employment and economic development\n##Energy security\n##Health and well-being\n##Climate change adaptation\n#Negative side effects\n#Costs and funding\n##Avoided costs of climate change effects\n##Distributing emissions abatement costs\n##Funding\n#Policies\n##National policies\n###Carbon pricing\n##International agreements\n###Paris Agreement\n#History\n#Society and culture\n##Commitments to divest\n##Barriers\n##Impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic\n#Examples by country\n##United States\n##China\n##European Union\n#See also\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Grade_(climbing)","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Grade_(climbing)","summary":"Many climbing routes have a grade that reflects the technical difficulty—and in some cases the risks and commitment level—of the route.  The first ascensionist can suggest a grade, but it will be amended to reflect the consensus view of subsequent ascents.  While many countries with a strong tradition of climbing developed grading systems, a small number of grading systems have become internationally dominant for each type of climbing, which has contributed to the standardization of grades worldwide.  Over the years, grades have consistently risen in all forms of climbing, helped by improvements in climbing technique and equipment.\nIn free climbing (i.e. climbing rock routes with no aid), the most widely used grading systems are the French numerical or sport system (e.g. f7c+), the American YDS system (e.g. 5.13a), and latterly the UIAA scale (e.g. IX+).  These systems are focused on technical difficulty, which is the main focus of the lower-risk activity of sport climbing.  The American system adds an R\/X suffix to traditional climbing routes to reflect the additional risks of climbing protection. Notable traditional climbing systems include the British E-grade system (e.g. E4 6a).\nIn bouldering (i.e. rock climbing on short routes), the most widely used systems are the American V-scale (or \"Hueco\") system (e.g. V14), and the French \"Font\" system (e.g. 8C+). The Font system often attaches an \"F\" prefix to further distinguish it from French sport climbing grades, which itself uses an \"f\" prefix (e.g. F8C+ vs. f8c+).  It is increasingly common for sport climbing rock routes to describe their hardest technical movements in terms of their boulder grade (e.g. an f7a sport climbing route being described as having a V6 crux).\nIn aid climbing (i.e. the opposite of free climbing), the most widely used system is the A-grade system (e.g. A3+), which was recalibrated in the 1990s as the \"new wave\" system from the legacy A-grade system.  For \"clean aid climbing\" (i.e. aid climbing equipment is used but only where the equipment is temporary and not permanently hammered into the rock), the most common system is the C-system (e.g. C3+). Aid climbing grades take time to stabilize as successive repeats of aid climbing routes can materially reduce the grade.\nIn ice climbing, the most widely used grading system is the WI (\"water ice\") system (e.g. WI6) and the identical AI (\"alpine ice\") system (e.g. AI6).  The related sport of mixed climbing (i.e. ice and dry-tool climbing) uses the M-grade system (e.g. M8), with other notable mixed grading systems including the Scottish Winter system (e.g. Grade VII). Pure dry-tooling routes (i.e. ice tools with no ice) use the D-grade prefix (e.g. D8 instead of M8).\nIn mountaineering and alpine climbing, the greater complexity of routes requires several grades to reflect the difficulties of the various rock, ice, and mixed climbing challenges.  The International French Adjectival System (IFAS, e.g.TD+)–which is identical to the \"UIAA Scale of Overall Difficulty\" (e.g. I–VI)–is used to grade the \"overall\" risk and difficulty of mountain routes (with the gradient of the snow\/ice fields) (e.g. the 1938 Heckmair Route on the Eiger is graded: ED2 (IFAS), VI− (UIAA), A0 (A-grade), WI4 (WI-grade), 60° slope).  The related \"commitment grade\" systems include the notable American National Climbing Classification System (e.g. I–VI).","content":"#History\n#Free climbing\n##French numerical grade\n##American YDS grade\n##UIAA scale\n##British E-grade\n##Other notable systems\n#Bouldering\n##Comparison with free climbing\n##Font grade\n##V-grade\n##Other notable systems\n#Aid climbing\n##Instability of aid grades\n##Original A-grade\n##New wave A-grade\n##Clean C-grade\n#Ice and mixed climbing\n##WI-grade\n##M-grade\n##D-grade\n##Scottish winter grade\n##Other notable systems\n#Mountaineering\n##International French Adjectival System\n##American NCCS\n##Russian\n##Alaskan\n##Other notable systems\n#Comparison tables\n##Comparison free climbing\n##Comparison bouldering\n##Comparison mountaineering\n#See also\n#References\n##Further reading\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}
{"title":"Tropical_cyclones_in_2023","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tropical_cyclones_in_2023","summary":"During 2023, tropical cyclones formed in seven major bodies of water, commonly known as tropical cyclone basins. They were named by various weather agencies when they attained maximum sustained winds of 35 knots (65 km\/h; 40 mph). Throughout the year, a total of 115 systems formed, with 79 of them being named. The most intense storm this year was Typhoon Mawar, which had a minimum pressure of 900 hPa (26.58 inHg). The deadliest tropical cyclone of the year was Storm Daniel, which killed at least 5,591 people in Libya, Greece, Turkey, and Bulgaria. Meanwhile, the costliest tropical cyclone was Typhoon Doksuri which caused at least $28.4 billion (USD) worth of damage in China, the Philippines and Taiwan, becoming the costliest on record outside the Atlantic Ocean basin. Among this year's systems, thirty became major tropical cyclones, of which ten intensified into Category 5 tropical cyclones on the Saffir–Simpson scale (SSHWS). This year, for the first time on record, at least one such Category 5 system formed in each tropical cyclone basin: Typhoons Mawar,   Saola, and Bolaven in the western Pacific Ocean, Hurricanes Jova and Otis in the eastern Pacific, Hurricane Lee in the Atlantic, Cyclone Mocha in the North Indian Ocean, Cyclone Freddy in the southwest Indian Ocean, Cyclone Ilsa in the Australian region, and Cyclone Kevin in the South Pacific. The accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) index for the 2023 (seven basins combined), as calculated by Colorado State University (CSU) was 857.4 units, which was above the 1991-2020 mean of 770.2 units.\nThe most active basin in the year was the North Atlantic Ocean, which had 20 named systems. The Eastern Pacific Ocean had an above-average and destructive season, with 17 named storms forming; 10 of those became hurricanes, of which 8 strengthened into major hurricanes – double the seasonal average. The Western Pacific Ocean had a total of 17 named storms, making it the second least active season in the basin, tying with 1998. The North Indian Ocean was unusually active, with six named storms forming, producing the second-most accumulated cyclone energy in this basin on record, only behind 2019. Activity across the southern hemisphere's three basins (South-West Indian, Australian, and South Pacific) was fairly significant, with the regions recording 17 named storms altogether, with the most intense Southern Hemisphere cyclone of the year, Cyclone Kevin in the South Pacific basin, peaking with a central pressure of 913 hPa (26.96 inHg).\nTropical cyclones were primarily monitored by ten warning centers across the world, which are designated as a Regional Specialized Meteorological Center (RSMC) or a Tropical Cyclone Warning Center (TCWC) by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). These ten centers are the National Hurricane Center (NHC) and the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC), Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), Météo-France (MFR), Indonesia's Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysical Agency (BMKG), the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM), Papua New Guinea's National Weather Service (PNGNWS), the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS), and New Zealand's MetService.

{"title":"Gerard_Krefft","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gerard_Krefft","summary":"Johann Ludwig (Louis) Gerard Krefft (17 February 1830 – 18 February 1881), was an Australian artist, draughtsman, scientist, and natural historian who served as the curator of the Australian Museum for 13 years (1861–1874). He was one of Australia's first and most influential palaeontologists and zoologists, \"some of [whose] observations on animals have not been surpassed and can no longer be equalled because of the spread of settlement (Rutledge & Whitley, 1974)..\nHe is also noted as an ichthyologist for his scientific description of the Queensland lungfish (now recognized as a classic example of Darwin's \"living fossils\"); and, in addition to his numerous scientific papers and his extensive series of weekly newspaper articles on natural history, his publications include The Snakes of Australia (1869), Guide to the Australian Fossil Remains in the Australian Museum (1870f), The Mammals of Australia (1871f), On Australian Entozoa (1872a), and Catalogue of the Minerals and Rocks in the Australian Museum (1873a).\nKrefft was one of the very few Australian scientists in the 1860s and 1870s to support Darwin's position on the origin of species by means of natural selection. According to Macdonald, et al. (2007), he was one of the first to warn of the devastating effects of the invasive species (sheep, cats, etc.) on native species. Also, along with several significant others — such as Charles Darwin, during his 1836 visit to the Blue Mountains, Edward Wilson, the proprietor of the Melbourne Argus, and George Bennett, one of the trustees of the Australian Museum — Krefft expressed considerable concern in relation to the effects of the expanding European settlement upon the indigenous population.\n\nGerard Krefft is a significant figure in the history of nineteenth century Australian science. He is celebrated not only for his zoological work but as a man who was prepared to challenge individuals on points of scientific fact regardless of their position in Sydney society or metropolitan science. He is also remembered as one who could be abrasive and incautious in delicate political situations and a man whose career and life ultimately ended in tragedy. The dramatic end of Krefft's career in 1874 — where he was stripped of his position as Australian Museum curator, physically removed from the Museum and his character assassinated — often overshadows his early career and his development as a scientist.—Stephens (2013), p. 187.","content":"#Family\n##Education\n##Marriage\n##German heritage\n#\"Natural history\"\n#\"Darwinian doctrine\" and the consequent \"Darwinian controversy\"\n##Evolution\n##Natural selection\n##Ellegård's five \"positions\" held by scientists in the Darwinian controversy\n#Artist\n#Victoria (1852 – 1858)\n##Melbourne\n##Blandowski, the Museum of Natural History, and Professor McCoy\n#Germany\n#Natural historian, museum curator and administrator\n##Darwinism\n#\"The New Museum Idea\"\n##Cabinets of curiosities\n##Public museums\n##The \"new museum\"\n##Krefft's curatorial rationale\n##Lack of funding\n#Photography\n#Queensland lungfish (Neoceratodus forsteri)\n##Louis Agassiz and the Chimaera\n##Gerard Krefft, William Forster, and the cartilaginous Burnett Salmon or barramunda\n##January 1870\n#Krefft's \"Natural History\" articles in The Sydney Mail\n##George B.

{"title":"Starship_flight_test_1","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Starship_flight_test_1","summary":"Starship flight test 1 was the maiden flight of the integrated SpaceX Starship launch vehicle. SpaceX performed the flight test on April 20, 2023. The prototype vehicle was destroyed less than four minutes after lifting off from the SpaceX Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas. The vehicle became the most powerful rocket ever flown, breaking the half-century-old record held by the Soviet Union's N1 rocket. The launch was the first \"integrated flight test,\" meaning it was the first time that both the Super Heavy booster and the Starship spacecraft flew together as a fully integrated Starship launch vehicle.\nThe launch was part of SpaceX's Starship development program, which follows an iterative and incremental approach involving frequent, and often destructive, test flights of prototype vehicles. Before the launch, SpaceX officials said they would measure the mission's success \"by how much we can learn\" and that various planned mission events \"are not required for a successful test\". The flight was generally regarded as having furthered Starship's development, and a variety of public officials congratulated SpaceX, including NASA administrator Bill Nelson and European Space Agency Director General Josef Aschbacher. \nIt was planned for the Starship spacecraft to complete nearly one orbit around the Earth before reentering the atmosphere, performing a controlled landing and splashing down in the Pacific Ocean near Hawaii. The Super Heavy booster was to have performed a similar landing in the Gulf of Mexico, about 20 mi (30 km) off the Texas coast about 8 minutes after liftoff.\nThe rocket lifted off at 13:33 UTC (8:33 am CDT, local time at the launch site) from SpaceX's private launch site near Boca Chica, Texas. The liftoff damaged the launch pad and its surrounding infrastructure, which SpaceX said was unexpected. Some debris spread into Boca Chica State Park. Three engines did not start or aborted before liftoff, and several others failed during the flight. The vehicle passed max q and entered supersonic flight, but, due to a lack of thrust or thrust vector control, no attempt was made at stage separation. Starship began to tumble, triggering the autonomous flight termination system (AFTS), which took 40 seconds to destroy the vehicle, nearly 4 minutes into the flight. \nAfter the test, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) grounded the launch program pending results of a standard “mishap investigation” overseen by the agency and performed by SpaceX. The FAA said that a return to flight would depend on the agency's determination that future launches would not affect public safety. In August 2023, SpaceX submitted to the FAA the 63 \"corrective actions\" that it would need to take before another Starship launch would be allowed. Dust scattered by the launch initially caused some health concerns, but was later found by a laboratory to be ordinary beach sand, not posing a health hazard.\nA second flight test of the Starship vehicle occurred on November 18, 2023. The launch did not repeat issues encountered on the first flight and the vehicle successfully performed stage separation, but both vehicles were lost thereafter.","content":"#Background\n##Starship\n##Development\n##Opinions before launch\n##Test objectives\n#Launch\n##Flight profile\n##Flight timeline\n##April 17 2023 attempt\n##April 20, 2023, 2nd attempt\n#Aftermath\n##Technical assessments\n##Launch site\n##Effects on environment\n##FAA investigation\n#See also\n#Notes\n","lang":"en"}

Reports of these events later attracted media attention, public backlash and political controversy. In January 2022, twelve gatherings came under investigation by the Metropolitan Police, including at least three attended by Johnson, the prime minister. The police issued 126 fixed penalty notices to 83 individuals, including Johnson, his wife Carrie and Rishi Sunak (then Chancellor of the Exchequer), who all apologised and paid the penalties.\nThe first reporting was on 30 November 2021 by the Daily Mirror of 10 Downing Street staff gatherings during the 2020 Christmas season. Johnson said rules had been followed, and Downing Street denied that a party took place. A week later, video of a mock press conference in 10 Downing Street was broadcast in which joking comments about a party having taken place were made. Allegra Stratton was featured in the video during her role as Downing Street Press Secretary. She resigned her subsequent government position after the video surfaced. Shaun Bailey resigned as chair of the London Assembly's Police and Crime Committee after evidence emerged that he had attended a gathering, where it was alleged that Covid regulations had been broken on 14 December 2020 with Conservative Party staff. In January 2022, reports emerged of an event with drinks on 20 May 2020 in the garden of 10 Downing Street during the first national lockdown. Johnson said that he attended and apologised for doing so. Downing Street apologised to Queen Elizabeth II for two events on 16 April 2021, the day before Prince Philip's funeral, during a third lockdown across England. Reports followed of a gathering celebrating Johnson's birthday in June 2020.\nAfter the mock press conference video leaked, on 8 December 2021, Johnson announced a Cabinet Office inquiry, eventually undertaken by civil servant Sue Gray. In January 2022, the Metropolitan Police opened its own investigation into potential breaches of COVID-19 regulations, which delayed Gray's report. An update on Gray's investigation was published on 31 January 2022. Gray's final report in May 2022 described multiple events, including excessive drinking and a lack of respect shown to cleaning and security staff. She concluded that senior political and civil service leadership \"must bear responsibility for this culture\".\nPublic disquiet over the events led to a decline in public support for Johnson, the government and the Conservatives, and contributed to the party's loss of the 2021 North Shropshire by-election and poor performance in the 2022 local elections. In early 2022, a number of opposition, and a few Conservative, politicians called for Johnson's resignation or a confidence vote. The scandal led to the resignation of five senior Downing Street staff in February, and that of Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice David Wolfson in April. On 21 April, MPs referred the allegations that Johnson misled Parliament over events to the Parliamentary Privileges Committee.\nOn 9 June 2023, Johnson resigned as an MP after having received the committee's draft report. The committee's final report, published six days later, concluded Johnson had deliberately and repeatedly misled Parliament and impugned and intimidated the committee, would have recommended a 90-day suspension had he not resigned, and recommended that Johnson not be given a courtesy access pass to Parliament otherwise given to former MPs. On 19 June 2023, MPs voted 354 to 7 to accept the results of the privileges committee report, which included Johnson having his privilege to access parliament removed.","content":"#Background\n##COVID-19 lockdowns in the United Kingdom\n##Westminster\n#Timeline of reporting and reaction\n##2021\n###Up to 6 December\n###Stratton video (7–8 December)\n###9 December onwards\n##2022\n###Up to 19 January\n###From 24 January\n###After the conclusion of the police investigation\n###After the publication of Gray's report\n##2023\n###COVID-19 Inquiry evidence\n###June–October 2023\n#Events\n##During first national lockdown\n##Mid-2020\n##During second lockdown in England\n##With London in Tier 2\n##With London in Tier 3\n##During third lockdown in England\n#Investigations\n##Cabinet Office inquiry\n###Simon Case\n###Sue Gray\n###Investigation update\n###Alleged lobbying before the final report was published\n###Final report\n##Police investigation\n###Fixed penalty notices\n###Scrutiny of the investigation\n##Privileges Committee investigation\n#Reactions\n##Within the Conservative Party\n###Initial responses\n###Alleged intimidation of MPs opposed to Johnson\n###After the Sue Gray update\n###Confidence vote\n###Johnson resignation\n##Election results\n##Opinion polls\n##Independent adviser on ministers' interests\n#Labour Party event in Durham\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}
{"title":"To_Fly!","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/To_Fly!","summary":"To Fly! is a 1976 American short docudrama film directed by Greg MacGillivray and Jim Freeman of MacGillivray Freeman Films, who wrote the story with Francis Thompson, Robert M. Young, and Arthur Zegart. It premiered at the giant-screen IMAX theater of the National Air and Space Museum, which opened to celebrate the United States Bicentennial. The film chronicles the history of aviation in the US, with a narration written by Thomas McGrath. Thematically, it explores the search for national identity through the country's westward expansion as well as humanity's relationship with aviation.\nThe idea of the film was proposed in 1970 and revisited two years later following the museum's interest in an IMAX theater for the planned building. MacGillivray and Freeman expanded a treatment written by the Smithsonian Institution and Thompson, adding various scenes in the storyboard intended to jolt IMAX audiences. Due to the large dimensions of the screens, the filmmakers aimed for immersion and clarity via novel cinematographic techniques. This was further enhanced by the surround sound design. The ending space sequence, featuring the first IMAX rocket launch scene, was made with various experimental special effects. The film was edited by MacGillivray and Freeman, and features a score composed by Bernardo Segall. It was finished on schedule in two years, with a low US$590,000 fund from Conoco.\nTo Fly! was released on July 1, 1976, distributed by Lawrence Associates and Conoco. It was initially scheduled to screen only for the Bicentennial, but due to public demand was kept indefinitely. In response to these demands, a 20th-anniversary special edition was released in 1996. The film led to an increase in the number of IMAX theaters worldwide and helped popularizing the nascent format, with various intense reactions observed among audiences, and was thus included in the National Film Registry and IMAX Hall of Fame. It also set MacGillivray as a major IMAX filmmaker. With increasing popularity, To Fly! remained among the highest-grossing giant-screen documentaries. Critics praised the film in its audiovisual and narrative aspects—though some were negative on the latter—and it received several accolades.","content":"#Summary\n#Production\n##Background\n##Pre-production\n##Filming\n###Space sequence\n##Post-production\n#Themes and style\n#Release\n##NASM\n##Other venues\n##Home media\n#Reception\n##Box office\n##Critical response\n##Audience response\n##Accolades\n#Legacy\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

The movement was historically defined by a repudiation of liberal and modernist theology, the publication (1905–1915) entitled, The Fundamentals, and had the intent to progress and revitalise evangelical Protestantism in predominantly English-speaking Protestant countries, as well as to reform separated churches according to the Bible, historic expression of faith and the principles of the Reformation. The Fundamentalist–Modernist controversy, and the Downgrade controversy, kindled the growth and development of reformed fundamentalism in the United States and the United Kingdom. Reformed fundamentalists have laid greater emphasis on historic confessions of faith, such as the Westminster Confession of Faith.","content":"#History and main leaders\n#Theological distinctives\n##Broader conservative evangelicalism\n###Pertaining to salvation and the gospel\n###Other fundamental Protestant and biblical theology\n##The inspiration and preservation of the Scriptures\n###Verbal plenary inspiration\n###Preservation of the texts of scripture\n##Common principles of Reformation evangelical interpretation and private reading\n##The classical creeds and reformational confessions\n#Congregational practices\n#Bible translation and usage\n##The Authorised Version Tradition, the Byzantine Received Text, and Eastern (Greek) and Western (Greco-Latin) Ecclesiastical Translation Traditions\n##Modern versions, denominational preferences and translation controversies\n#Evangelical and missional apologetics\n##Bible apologetics\n#Liberal-modernist challenge to verbal inspiration and truthfulness of scripture\n#Modern biblical criticism\n#Modern Western society and intellectual unbelief\n##Criticism of New-Neo Evangelicalism and the 'Present Downgrade'\n##Materialist and naturalist unbelief, and historic Adamism and creationism\n#See also\n#Resources\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"George_Griffith","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/George_Griffith","summary":"George Chetwynd Griffith-Jones (20 August 1857 – 4 June 1906) was a British writer. He was active mainly in the science fiction genre—or as it was known at the time, scientific romance—in particular writing many future-war stories and playing a significant role in shaping that emerging subgenre. For a short period of time, he was the leading science fiction author in his home country both in terms of popularity and commercial success.\nGriffith grew up with his parents and older brother, receiving home-schooling and moving frequently during his childhood due to his father's career as a clergyman. Following his father's death when Griffith was 14 years old, he went to school for little over a year before leaving England and travelling the world, returning at the age of 19. He then worked as a teacher for ten years before pursuing a career in writing. After an initial setback that left Griffith without the means to provide for himself, he was hired by the publisher C. Arthur Pearson in 1890. Griffith made his literary breakthrough with his debut novel The Angel of the Revolution (1893), which was serialized in Pearson's Weekly before being published in book format. He signed a contract of exclusivity with Pearson and followed it up with the likewise successful sequel Olga Romanoff (1894).\nGriffith was highly active as a writer throughout the 1890s, producing numerous serials and short stories for Pearson's various publications. He also wrote non-fiction for Pearson and went on various travel assignments. Among these were an 1894 publicity stunt in which he circumnavigated the world in 65 days, an 1895 journey to South America where he covered the various revolutionary movements active there at the time, and an 1896 trip to Southern Africa that resulted in Griffith writing the novel Briton or Boer? (1897) anticipating the outbreak of the Boer War (1899–1902). Griffith's career declined in the latter part of the 1890s, and he was surpassed by H. G. Wells as the favourite science fiction writer of both Pearson and the reading public. His last outright success was A Honeymoon in Space (1901), and he parted ways with Pearson shortly thereafter. With his health in decline, likely due to alcoholism, he continued writing prolifically up until his death at the age of 48.\nGriffith was both successful and influential as a writer at the peak of his career, but he has since descended into obscurity. Retrospective assessments have found his works to have been timely and prescient—in particular with regard to the importance of aerial warfare—but not timeless, and he is commonly regarded as a relatively poor writer, especially when compared to his main rival, Wells. He regularly incorporated his personal viewpoints into his fiction, and anti-American sentiments expressed in this way ensured that he never established a readership in the United States as publishers there would not print his works. He was irreligious and in his youth advocated fiercely for secularism. Politically, Griffith was early an outspoken socialist, though he is believed to have gradually shifted towards more right-leaning sympathies later in his life. Socially, he has been described as embodying Victorian ideals, including social conservatism and staunch pro-British views.","content":"#Biography\n##Early life\n##Teaching career\n##Writing career\n###Early career\n###Breakthrough\n###Mid-1890s\n###Decline\n###Final years\n##Death\n#Legacy\n##Place in science fiction history\n##Literary proficiency\n##In relation to H.

{"title":"Funeral_for_Yesterday","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Funeral_for_Yesterday","summary":"Funeral for Yesterday is the fourth studio album by Canadian heavy metal band Kittie, released on February 20, 2007. It was the only album released through the band's own record label, X of Infamy Records, and Merovingian Music (MRV). The album was produced by Jack Ponti, and was recorded at RetroMedia Sound Studios in Red Bank, New Jersey, between July and August 2006. Loosely themed around the band's demise and rebirth following a period of turmoil, the album saw Kittie transition towards a more melodic and accessible sound while retaining some of their heavier sensibilities, and was also noted for its greater focus on clean singing than on the band's previous releases. It was the first Kittie album with guitarist Tara McLeod, and only with bassist Trish Doan.  \nFuneral for Yesterday received generally favourable reviews from critics, who highlighted the band's newfound chemistry and growth, though its focus on clean singing drew mixed reactions. The album debuted at number 101 on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling just under 9,000 copies in its first week. Its lead single and title track, \"Funeral For Yesterday\", became Kittie's biggest radio hit up to that point, reaching number 40 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. Kittie toured extensively in support of the album, touring North America, South America and Europe between February 2007 and November 2008.","content":"#Background\n#Recording and production\n#Composition and lyrics\n#Release\n##Promotion\n##Touring\n#Critical reception\n#Track listing\n#Personnel\n#Charts\n#Notes\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}
{"title":"Turkey","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Turkey","summary":"Turkey, officially the Republic of Türkiye, is a country mainly located in Anatolia in West Asia, with a smaller part called East Thrace in Southeast Europe. It borders the Black Sea to the north; Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Iran to the east; Iraq, Syria, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south; and the Aegean Sea, Greece, and Bulgaria to the west. Turkey is home to over 85 million people; most are ethnic Turks, while ethnic Kurds are the largest ethnic minority. Officially a secular state, Turkey has a Muslim-majority population. Ankara is Turkey's capital and second-largest city, while Istanbul is its largest city and economic and financial center. Other major cities include İzmir, Bursa, and Antalya.\nTurkey was first inhabited by modern humans during the Late Paleolithic. Home to important Neolithic sites like Göbekli Tepe and some of the earliest farming areas, present-day Turkey was inhabited by various ancient peoples. The Hattians were assimilated by the Anatolian peoples, such as the Hittites. Classical Anatolia transitioned into cultural Hellenization following the conquests of Alexander the Great; Hellenization continued during the Roman and Byzantine eras. The Seljuk Turks began migrating into Anatolia in the 11th century, starting the Turkification process. The Seljuk Sultanate of Rum ruled Anatolia until the Mongol invasion in 1243, when it disintegrated into Turkish principalities. Beginning in 1299, the Ottomans united the principalities and expanded; Mehmed II conquered Istanbul in 1453. During the reigns of Selim I and Suleiman the Magnificent, the Ottoman Empire became a global power. From 1789 onwards, the empire saw a major transformation, reforms, and centralization while its territory declined.\nIn the 19th and early 20th centuries, persecution of Muslims during the Ottoman contraction and in the Russian Empire resulted in large-scale loss of life and mass migration into modern-day Turkey from the Balkans, Caucasus, and Crimea. Under the control of the Three Pashas, the Ottoman Empire entered World War I in 1914, during which the Ottoman government committed genocides against its Armenian, Greek, and Assyrian subjects. Following Ottoman defeat, the Turkish War of Independence resulted in the abolition of the sultanate and the signing of the Treaty of Lausanne. The Republic was proclaimed on 29 October 1923, modelled on the reforms initiated by the country's first president, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. Turkey remained neutral during most of World War II, but was involved in the Korean War. Several military interventions interfered with the transition to a multi-party system.\nTurkey is an upper-middle-income and emerging country; its economy is the world's 18th-largest by nominal and 11th-largest by PPP-adjusted GDP. It is a unitary presidential republic. Turkey is a founding member of the OECD, G20, and Organization of Turkic States. With a geopolitically significant location, Turkey is a regional power and an early member of NATO. An EU candidate, Turkey is part of the EU Customs Union, CoE, OIC, and TURKSOY.\nTurkey has coastal plains, a high central plateau, and various mountain ranges; its climate is temperate with harsher conditions in the interior. Home to three biodiversity hotspots, Turkey is prone to frequent earthquakes and is highly vulnerable to climate change. Turkey has a universal healthcare system, growing access to education, and increasing levels of innovativeness. It is a leading TV content exporter. With 21 UNESCO World Heritage sites, 30 UNESCO intangible cultural heritage inscriptions, and a rich and diverse cuisine, Turkey is the fifth most visited country in the world.","content":"#Etymology\n#History\n##Prehistory and ancient history\n##Early classical antiquity\n##Rome and Byzantine Empire\n##Seljuks and Anatolian beyliks\n##Ottoman Empire\n##Republic of Türkiye\n#Administrative divisions\n#Government and politics\n##Parties and elections\n##Law\n##Foreign relations\n##Military\n##Human rights\n##LGBTQ rights\n#Geography\n##Biodiversity\n##Climate\n#Economy\n##Infrastructure\n##Science and technology\n#Demographics\n##Ethnicity and language\n##Immigration\n##Religion\n##Education\n##Health\n#Culture\n##Literature, theatre, and visual arts\n##Music and dance\n##Architecture\n##Cuisine\n##Sports\n##Media and cinema\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n##Sources\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}
{"title":"Heraclitus","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Heraclitus","summary":"Heraclitus (; Greek: Ἡράκλειτος Hērákleitos; fl. c. 500 BC) was an ancient Greek pre-Socratic philosopher from the city of Ephesus, which was then part of the Persian Empire.  He exerts a wide influence on ancient and modern Western philosophy, including through the works of Plato, Aristotle, Hegel, and Heidegger.\nLittle is known of Heraclitus's life. He wrote a single work, only fragments of which have survived, catalogued under philosopher number 22 in the Diels–Kranz numbering system.  Already in antiquity, his paradoxical philosophy, appreciation for wordplay, and cryptic, oracular epigrams earned him the epithets \"the dark\" and \"the obscure\". He was considered arrogant and depressed, a misanthrope who was subject to melancholia. Consequently, he became known as \"the weeping philosopher\" in contrast to the ancient philosopher Democritus, who was known as \"the laughing philosopher\".\nThe central ideas of Heraclitus's philosophy are the unity of opposites and the concept of change. He also saw harmony and justice in strife. He viewed the world as constantly in flux, always \"becoming\" but never \"being\". He expressed this in sayings like \"Everything flows\" (Greek: πάντα ρει, panta rhei) and \"No man ever steps in the same river twice\". This insistence upon change contrasts with that of the ancient philosopher Parmenides, who believed in a reality of static \"being\".\nHeraclitus believed fire was the arche, the fundamental stuff of the world. In choosing an arche Heraclitus followed the Milesians before him – Thales with water, Anaximander with apeiron  (lit. boundless or infinite), and Anaximenes with air. Heraclitus also thought the logos (lit. word, discourse, or reason) gave structure to the world.","content":"#Life\n#On Nature\n##Structure\n##Style\n###The Obscure\n#Philosophy\n##Unity of opposites and flux\n###Panta rhei\n###You cannot step into the same river twice\n###Strife is justice\n##Logos\n##Fire\n###Fire as symbolic\n##Cosmology\n###Sun\n###Moon\n##God\n##The Soul\n##Foreign influence\n###Persia\n###India\n###Egypt\n#Legacy\n##Ancient\n###Pre-Socratics\n####Eleatics\n####Pluralists and atomists\n####Sophists\n###Classical and Hellenistic philosophy\n####Stoics\n####Cynics\n####Pyrrhonists\n###Early Christianity\n###Weeping philosopher\n##Modern\n###Rationalism\n###British empiricism\n####Common sense\n###Post-Kantianism\n####Heraclitean studies\n###Continental\n###Analytic\n####Wittgenstein\n####Contradiction\n####Philosophy of Religion\n####Philosophy of Time\n#Notes\n##Explanatory notes\n##Fragment numbers\n##Citations\n#References\n##Ancient sources\n###Testimony\n###Fragments\n###Imitation\n##Modern scholarship\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"2022_COVID-19_protests_in_China","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2022_COVID-19_protests_in_China","summary":"A series of protests against COVID-19 lockdowns began in mainland China in November 2022. Colloquially referred to as the White Paper Protests (Chinese: 白纸抗议; pinyin: Bái zhǐ kàngyì) or the A4 Revolution (Chinese: 白纸革命; pinyin: Bái zhǐ gémìng), the demonstrations started in response to measures taken by the Chinese government to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the country, including implementing a zero-COVID policy. Discontent had grown since the beginning of the pandemic towards the policy, which confined many people to their homes without work and left some unable to purchase or receive daily necessities.\nThe demonstrations had been preceded by the Beijing Sitong Bridge protest on 13 October, wherein pro-democracy banners were displayed by an unnamed individual and later seized by local authorities. The incident was subsequently censored by state media and led to a widespread crackdown behind the Great Firewall. Further small-scale protests inspired by the Sitong Bridge incident ensued in early November, before widespread civil unrest erupted following a 24 November building fire in Ürümqi that killed ten people, three months into a lockdown in Xinjiang. Protesters across the nation demanded the end of the government's zero-COVID policy and lockdowns.\nThe subjects in protest evolved throughout the course of the unrest, ranging from discontent with the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and its general secretary Xi Jinping, to inhumane working conditions brought on by the lockdowns, and human rights abuses against ethnic Uyghurs in Xinjiang. The police had largely allowed such rallies to proceed, although officers had reportedly arrested several protesters in Shanghai. There had also been reports of protesters being beaten and showered with pepper spray before detainment. By early December, China pivoted away from many of its previous COVID restrictions by reducing testing, reducing lockdowns, and allowing people with mild infections to quarantine at home, effectively abandoning the zero-COVID policy.","content":"#Background\n##COVID-19 lockdowns in China\n##Democracy movements of China\n##Sitong Bridge protest\n#Early protests\n##Lanzhou\n##Guangzhou\n##Zhengzhou Foxconn factory\n##Chongqing\n#Escalation: Ürümqi fire and reaction\n##26 November\n###Nanjing\n###Lanzhou\n###Shanghai\n###Chengdu\n###Xi'an\n###Korla\n##27 November\n###Shanghai\n###Beijing\n###Wuhan\n###Hong Kong\n##28 November\n###Shanghai\n###Hong Kong\n###Hangzhou\n###Beijing\n##29 November\n###Jinan\n###Guangzhou\n##30 November\n##4 December\n###Wuhan\n##5 December\n###Nanjing\n##Abroad\n#Censorship and resistance\n##Pro-government responses\n##Blank paper symbolism\n#Detentions\n#Reactions\n##China\n###Hong Kong\n##International\n###Countries\n###International organizations\n###Multinational corporations\n#Aftermath\n##Effects on civic engagement\n##2023 healthcare reform protests\n##Legal action for sharing videos of protests\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}
{"title":"Hurricane_Idalia","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hurricane_Idalia","summary":"Hurricane Idalia was a powerful and destructive tropical cyclone that caused significant damage across parts of the southeastern United States, especially in North Florida, in late August 2023. The ninth named storm, third hurricane, and second major hurricane of the 2023 Atlantic hurricane season, Idalia formed from a low-pressure area that crossed Central America from the eastern Pacific Ocean. Gradual development ensued as it meandered in the western part of the Caribbean Sea; the system was upgraded to a tropical depression on August 26, 2023, and strengthened into a tropical storm a day later, receiving the name Idalia. It traversed the Gulf of Mexico where it underwent rapid intensification, briefly becoming a Category 4 hurricane before weakening and making landfall in the Big Bend region of Florida as a low-end Category 3 hurricane on August 30. Idalia remained a hurricane as it moved through Northern Florida and crossed into Southeast Georgia; it then pushed into the Carolinas as a tropical storm. On August 31, Idalia emerged into the Atlantic, where it transitioned into a post-tropical cyclone that same day. Later, it passed south of Bermuda, made a counterclockwise loop, then meandered off the coast of Nova Scotia while winding down.\nIdalia caused significant damage to thousands of homes, businesses, and other infrastructure along its inland path, primarily in Florida, where winds and the resulting floodwaters were highest. Its storm surge was record-breaking from the Big Bend region south to Tampa Bay. In Tampa Bay roads were flooded over, and high waters submerged hundreds of cars. The system also spawned a tornado outbreak with around 12 confirmed tornadoes. Idalia was the most powerful hurricane to hit Florida's Big Bend region since Hurricane Easy in 1950. Five people died in storm-related incidents in the two states. The NCEI claims that Hurricane Idalia did $3.5 billion in damages. The hurricane's remnants produced dangerous rip currents across the Eastern United States during Labor Day Weekend, resulting in several additional deaths and numerous rescues.","content":"#Meteorological history\n#Preparations\n##Cuba\n##United States\n###Florida\n###Elsewhere\n##Bermuda\n#Impact\n##Caribbean\n##United States\n###Florida\n###Georgia\n###South Carolina\n###North Carolina\n###Elsewhere\n##Bermuda\n#Aftermath\n##United States\n###Florida\n###Georgia\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}
{"title":"Thor:_Love_and_Thunder","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Thor:_Love_and_Thunder","summary":"Thor: Love and Thunder is a 2022 American superhero film based on Marvel Comics featuring the character Thor. Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the sequel to Thor: Ragnarok (2017) and the 29th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Taika Waititi, who co-wrote the screenplay with Jennifer Kaytin Robinson, and stars Chris Hemsworth as Thor alongside Christian Bale, Tessa Thompson, Jaimie Alexander, Waititi, Russell Crowe, and Natalie Portman. In the film, Thor tries to find inner peace, but must return to action and recruit Valkyrie (Thompson), Korg (Waititi), and Jane Foster (Portman)—who is now the Mighty Thor—to stop Gorr the God Butcher (Bale) from eliminating all gods.\nHemsworth and Waititi had discussed plans for a sequel to Ragnarok by January 2018. Love and Thunder was announced in July 2019, with Hemsworth, Waititi, and Thompson all set to return, as well as Portman who did not appear in Ragnarok. Waititi wanted to differentiate Love and Thunder from Ragnarok, seeking to make a romance film and 1980s-inspired adventure. He adapted elements from Jason Aaron's run on Thor comic books during the 2010s, which similarly debuted Gorr and saw Foster take on the mantle and powers of Thor whilst under treatment for cancer. Robinson joined to contribute to the script in February 2020, and further casting was revealed later that year including the appearance of the Guardians of the Galaxy. Production was expected to begin in late 2020 but was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Filming ultimately began in January 2021 in Sydney, Australia with Barry Idoine as the director of photography, and concluded at the beginning of June.\nThor: Love and Thunder premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on June 23, 2022, and was released in the United States on July 8, as part of Phase Four of the MCU. The film received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the film for its light-heartedness, action sequences, and the performances of Hemsworth, Bale and Portman, but criticized the screenplay and tonal inconsistencies; while its humor and visual effects were met with polarized responses, many critics deemed the film inferior to Ragnarok. The film grossed $760.9 million worldwide, making it the eighth-highest-grossing film of 2022, as well as the second-highest-grossing film in the Thor franchise.","content":"#Plot\n#Cast\n#Production\n##Development\n###Writing\n##Pre-production\n##Filming\n##Post-production\n#Music\n#Marketing\n#Release\n##Theatrical\n##Home media\n#Reception\n##Box office\n##Critical response\n##Accolades\n#Documentary special\n#Future\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

It was caused by the September 2022 mini-budget and a disorganised vote in the House of Commons over a parliamentary motion to ban fracking, ultimately resulting in the loss of support of Conservative members of parliament (MPs).\nThe mini-budget was a ministerial statement entitled \"The Growth Plan\" delivered by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kwasi Kwarteng, to the House of Commons on 23 September. It was received negatively by global financial markets and ultimately led to the dismissal of Kwarteng on 14 October. In the following days, Truss came under increasing pressure to reverse further elements of the mini-budget to satisfy the markets and, by 17 October, five Conservative MPs had called for her resignation. On 19 October, Suella Braverman, the Home Secretary, resigned over a breach of the Ministerial Code following a disagreement with Truss over immigration reform; her resignation letter was critical of the government.\nOn the evening of 19 October, MPs voted on a Labour Party motion to create time to debate a ban on fracking in the UK, which was opposed by the government. It was unclear whether the vote was being treated as a confidence vote by the government, which confused Conservative MPs. The confusion was compounded by speculation that Wendy Morton and Craig Whittaker, respectively the chief whip and deputy chief whip, had resigned, and by allegations, later refuted, that some Conservative MPs had been manhandled in the division lobby.\nTruss resigned as prime minister on 25 October, having announced her intention to do so on 20 October. Rishi Sunak won the ensuing Conservative Party leadership election unopposed to become party leader and prime minister. Truss was in office for 49 days, a shorter duration than the total for any preceding UK prime minister.","content":"#Background\n#Resignations and dismissals\n#Parliament\n#Reactions\n##Opinion polls\n##Bookmakers\n##Daily Star lettuce and tofu\n#See also\n#Notes\n","lang":"en"}

From May 2022 until April 2023, The Usos were promoted as the Undisputed WWE Tag Team Champions until they lost their titles at WrestleMania 39, as they simultaneously held both the Raw and SmackDown tag titles in their third and fifth respective reigns, having the longest reign and the longest male tag team title reign in WWE history for the latter. During this time, the stable included Sami Zayn as an honorary member, and also The Usos' younger brother Solo Sikoa.\nAfter a falling out with Reigns, Zayn left in January 2023, followed by Jey in June. In February 2024 during the build up to WrestleMania XL, The Rock joined the group, but following the event in April, both Reigns and Rock took an indefinite hiatus, with Sikoa assuming the role of \"Tribal Chief\". Following this, Jimmy and Heyman were removed from the group by Sikoa, while Tama Tonga, Tonga Loa, and Jacob Fatu were added. Reigns then made his return in August, turning face for the first time since 2020, and to be \"The Only Tribal Chief\", and began feuding with Sikoa's iteration of The Bloodline.","content":"#Background\n#History\n##The Usos' feud with The Shield (2013–2014)\n##Occasional team-ups (2015–2020)\n##Roman Reigns' leadership (2020–2024)\n###Official Formation of The Bloodline (2020–2021)\n###All champions, rivalry with The New Day (2021–2022)\n###Induction of Sami Zayn and Solo Sikoa (2022–2023)\n###Bloodline Civil War (2023)\n###Addition of The Rock and feud with Cody Rhodes (2023–2024)\n##Solo Sikoa's leadership (2024–present)\n###Additions of The Tongans and Jacob Fatu (2024)\n###Bloodline Civil War II (2024–present)\n#Members\n##Current\n##Former\n#Timeline\n#Sub-groups\n##Current\n##Former\n#Championships and accomplishments\n#Other media\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

Aboard the submersible were Stockton Rush, the American chief executive officer of OceanGate; Paul-Henri Nargeolet, a French deep-sea explorer and Titanic expert; Hamish Harding, a British businessman; Shahzada Dawood, a Pakistani-British businessman; and Dawood's son, Suleman. \nCommunication between Titan and its mother ship, MV Polar Prince, was lost 1 hour and 33 minutes into the dive. Authorities were alerted when it failed to resurface at the scheduled time later that day. After the submersible had been missing for four days, a remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV) discovered a debris field containing parts of Titan, about 500 metres (1,600 ft) from the bow of the Titanic. The search area was informed by the United States Navy's (USN) sonar detection of an acoustic signature consistent with an implosion around the time communications with the submersible ceased, suggesting the pressure hull had imploded while Titan was descending, resulting in the instantaneous deaths of all five occupants.\nThe search and rescue operation was performed by an international team organized by the United States Coast Guard (USCG), USN, and Canadian Coast Guard. Support was provided by aircraft from the Royal Canadian Air Force and United States Air National Guard, a Royal Canadian Navy ship, as well as several commercial and research vessels and ROVs.\nNumerous industry experts had stated concerns about the safety of the vessel. OceanGate executives, including Rush, had not sought certification for Titan, arguing that excessive safety protocols and regulations hindered innovation.","content":"#Background\n##OceanGate\n##Titanic\n#Submersible Titan\n##Dives to wreck of Titanic\n##Safety\n##Prior concerns\n##Previous incidents\n#Incident\n##Expedition arrangements\n##16–17 June preparations\n##18 June, dive, disappearance, and implosion\n##18–22 June, search and rescue efforts\n##22 June, discovery of debris\n##Fatalities\n#Recovery operations\n#Investigations\n##United States\n##Canada\n#Lawsuit\n#Financial costs of operations\n#Reactions\n#In social and mass media\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

It was held at Hayward Field in Eugene, Oregon, United States, from July 15–24, 2022, with the country hosting that competition for the first time. The competition was originally scheduled for August 6–15, 2021, but it was pushed back by one year due to the postponement of the 2020 Summer Olympics to 2021.\nAfter the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, World Athletics banned all Russian and Belarusian athletes and officials from participating at the championships. In addition, the stringent vaccination requirements for people entering the United States caused visa delays for participants and officials, with some ultimately being unable to enter the country. These issues caused the final total to stand at 179 nations (180 including the Athlete Refugee Team), the lowest number since Tokyo 1991.\nA record 29 countries won at least one gold medal during the championships. Peru, Kazakhstan, and Nigeria won their first-ever gold medals. India and Burkina Faso had their best medal performances, winning a silver, and the Philippines won a bronze. A new award was the team event trophy, which was won by the United States, which also won the most gold medals, with 13, and the most medals overall, with 33 (a record for a single edition). The event was the most-watched edition ever in US television history. More than 146,000 tickets were sold, with several evening sessions sold out.\nThere were four athletes who won two gold medals: Kimberly García in the Women's 20km Race Walk and the Women's 35km Race Walk; Michael Norman in the Men's 400m and the Men's 4 × 400 m Relay; Sydney McLaughlin in the Women's 400m Hurdles and the Women's 4 × 400 m Relay; and Abby Steiner in the Women's 4 × 100 m Relay and Women's 4 × 400 m Relay. In addition to the athletes who won two gold medals, Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce and Shericka Jackson both of Jamaica, earned 3 medals, 1 gold and 2 silvers in the Women's 100m (Fraser-Pryce gold; Jackson silver), the Women's 200 metres (Jackson gold; Fraser-Pryce silver) and the Women's 4 × 100 m Relay (silver for both).\nThree world records and 13 championship records were broken. The world records were set by Sydney McLaughlin, who ran 50.68 seconds in the Women's 400m Hurdles final; Tobi Amusan, who won the Women's 100m Hurdles semi-final in 12.12 seconds; and Armand Duplantis, who reached 6.21 meters in the Men's Pole Vault final.","content":"#Host selection and venue\n##Venue\n#Results\n##Men\n###Track\n###Field\n###Combined\n##Women\n###Track\n###Field\n###Combined\n##Mixed\n##World Team\n#Medal table\n#Placing table\n#Entry standards\n##Target numbers\n##Area Champions\n#Schedule\n#Participating nations\n#Prize money\n#Media coverage\n##International broadcasters\n##National broadcasters\n#Notes and references\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) conducted some 147 airstrikes in Gaza and Palestinian militants fired approximately 1,100 rockets towards Israel. The operation, ordered by Prime Minister Yair Lapid and Defense Minister Benny Gantz without prior Cabinet discussion or approval, followed a raid in Jenin in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, in which Israeli forces arrested Bassam al-Saadi, a leader of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) in that area.  On 6 August, Israel arrested 20 people in the West Bank of whom 19 were members of PIJ and a further 20 on 7 August according to an unnamed Israeli official.\nThe initial attack included the targeted killing of Tayseer al-Jabari, a military leader of the group. On the second day, the PIJ commander of the Southern area of the Strip, Khaled Mansour, was also targeted and killed. Islamic Jihad stated that the Israeli bombardments were a 'declaration of war' and responded with retaliatory rocket fire towards Israel.\nThe clashes resulted in the death of at least 49 Palestinians, including 17 children, according to the Gaza health ministry. The IDF stated that over a dozen of these deaths, including 12 of the children, were caused by failed PIJ rocket launches. This was disputed by the father of one of the victims, while other Gaza residents and journalists state they saw the misfires by PIJ and called for an investigation of the misfires. On 13 August, Haaretz reported that misfires killed 14 civilians, including seven children. Some 20% of rockets fell short and into Gaza.\nThe clashes ended with a truce that was confirmed by both sides on the night of 7 August 2022.","content":"#Background\n#Wider commentary\n#Timeline\n#Palestinian rocket failures\n#Diplomacy\n#Possible war crimes\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

The plan executed from 3 to 4 May 2020 was for expatriate Venezuelan former military personnel living in Colombia to enter the country by boat at Macuto, take control of an airfield, capture Maduro and other high-level figures in his administration, and expel them from the country.\nA landing attempt to initiate the operation went forward despite its impracticality. Two boats were launched from eastern Colombia toward the Caribbean coast of Venezuela north of Caracas, carrying approximately 60 Venezuelan dissidents and two American former Green Berets employed as mercenaries by Silvercorp. Both boats were intercepted before they reached land. At least six Venezuelan dissidents in the first boat were killed, and all but four of the invaders were captured during the attempted landing or subsequent search operations, including the two Americans from the second boat, whose interrogations were broadcast on state television.\nVenezuelan intelligence agencies and the Associated Press (AP) had prior knowledge of the operation. Commentators and observers described the operation as amateurish, underfunded, poorly organized, impossible, and a suicide mission, and divergent narratives led to questions about how the plot unfolded. Sources criticized the poor planning and execution, alternating between characterizing the operation as an attempted invasion, infiltration, raid, ambush, assassination or coup. Maduro and his representatives described the attacking force as terrorists who planned to kill him in a plot coordinated by Colombia and the United States. Guaidó and some supporters described the event as a false flag orchestrated by Maduro, and Goudreau described the team as freedom fighters seeking to restore democracy.","content":"#Background\n#Planning\n##Initial promotion: March–May 2019\n##Colombia Silvercorp established: June 2019\n##Negotiations with Guaidó representatives: August–November 2019\n##Alcalá and Goudreau resume preparations: December 2019\n##Extradition of Alcalá to the United States: March 2020\n###Prior knowledge of operation\n##Final preparations, Associated Press article: April–May 2020\n#Landing attempt\n#Aftermath\n##Indictments and arrests\n##Criminal charges, extradition requests and sentences\n##Investigation of interception and deaths\n##Goudreau lawsuit\n#Reactions\n##Domestic\n###Maduro administration\n###Guaidó administration and opposition\n###NGOs\n##International\n##Characterization\n#In popular culture\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n##Bibliography\n###Journal articles\n###Books\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}
{"title":"Far-right_politics_in_Serbia","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Far-right_politics_in_Serbia","summary":"Far-right politics in Serbia emerged shortly before the break-up of Yugoslavia and have been present ever since. Its manifestation mostly relies on national and religious factors. \nIn the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, far-right politicians and groups existed but did not receive much support. Milan Stojadinović, the prime minister of Yugoslavia from 1935 until 1939, saw fascism as an ideological role model for his premiership, while Milan Nedić, who was appointed prime minister of the puppet government in 1941, was a supporter of fascist ideas. Dimitrije Ljotić headed Zbor, a minor party that was inspired by Italian fascism. Ljotić cooperated with Bishop Nikolaj Velimirović, who is viewed as an antisemite and a promoter of anti-Western sentiment. The Chetniks under Draža Mihailović, who collaborated with the Axis powers as early as 1941, remained an inspiration for modern far-right groups.\nDuring the break-up of Yugoslavia, the far-right re-emerged, with the Serbian Radical Party (SRS), led by Vojislav Šešelj, gaining support after using sanctions, increased inflation, and a high unemployment rate to their advantage to boost their support. The SRS cooperated with Slobodan Milošević during the 1990s, although it also briefly served in opposition. During the Yugoslav Wars, far-right groups committed violence and acted as paramilitaries, such as the SRS-led White Eagles. After the overthrow of Milošević in 2000, attacks orchestrated by the far-right rose. In parliamentary politics, the SRS won the most votes in the 2003 and 2007 elections, though campaigning on an anti-corruption platform. The 2010 Belgrade anti-gay riot was organised by the far-right, including groups such as Obraz. The Constitutional Court later concluded a ban on Nacionalni stroj and Obraz in 2011 and 2012, respectively. The far-right embraced opposition to immigration in the late 2010s, with parties and organisations such as Dveri, Serbian Party Oathkeepers, Levijatan, and People's Patrol embracing the sentiment. The Russian invasion of Ukraine helped the far-right cross the electoral threshold in the 2022 parliamentary election, though, in the 2023 election, they lost representation.\n\nIn Serbia, the Christian right and neo-Nazi variants of the far-right exist. Far-right groups tend to be antisemitic and Islamophobic, and they promote conspiracy theories. They also promote anti-communism, militarism, and religious fanaticism. Some also have ties with the Serbian Orthodox Church (SPC). The far-right often glorifies convicted war criminals like Radovan Karadžić and Ratko Mladić, while some groups also called for the rehabilitation of collaborationists Nedić and Ljotić. The far-right has orchestrated violent protests and attacks against ethnic minorities, the LGBT community, activists, and non-governmental organisations whom they label as \"foreign mercenaries\". The far-right promotes anti-Westernism, Euroscepticism, closer ties with Russia, and the return of Kosovo's sovereignty to Serbia. The unemployed working-class youth is often recruited by far-right groups; the far-right tends to present themselves as \"patriotic\" groups or as humanitarian organisations. Far-right groups are often small in number and have been institutionally marginal, though on the Internet, far-right content has received large amounts of following.","content":"#Overview\n##Definition\n##Symbolism\n##Influence\n#History\n##Yugoslavia\n##1990s–2000s\n##Contemporary period\n#Political groups\n##Organisations\n###Blood and Honour\n###I live for Serbia\n###Leviathan\n###Nacionalni stroj\n###National Serb Front\n###Obraz\n###People's Patrol\n###SNP 1389\n###SNP Naši\n###Serbian Action\n###Serbian Honour\n##Political parties\n###Dveri\n###Serbian Party Oathkeepers\n###Serbian Radical Party\n###Serbian Right\n##Others\n#Individuals\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n##Bibliography\n##News sources\n##Footnotes\n#External links\n#Further reading\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Russian_information_war_against_Ukraine","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Russian_information_war_against_Ukraine","summary":"The Russian information war against Ukraine was articulated by the Russian government as part of the Gerasimov doctrine. They believed that Western governments were instigating color revolutions in former Soviet states which posed a threat to Russia. \nThe concept of informatsionnaya voyna (Russian: информационная война, lit. 'informational war') encompasses various strategies, including cyberwarfare, often described as technical defenses against technical attacks in warfare. However, cyberwarfare is just one aspect of Russia's information war, which may include controlling undersea communications cables, shaping national narratives, manipulating the news cycle, and flooding the information space with Russian bots and trolls. The goal is to achieve strategic victory and exert reflexive control. These efforts were used as part of its disinformation in the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\nDue to effective censorship, most media outlets in Russia are government-controlled, allowing Kremlin messaging to successfully sway the citizens of the Russian Federation to support its approach in Ukraine. The Kremlin has denied waging war in Ukraine, claiming it only wants to protect Russian speakers against Ukrainian Nazis. This narrative has been reinforced by Russian television since 2014, giving it an advantage through repetition and familiarity. According to a poll, 58 percent of Russians approved of this perspective between 28 February and 3 March 2022.","content":"#Background\n##Doctrine\n##Reasons for the conflict\n###Revanchism\n###History of the war\n#Information operations\n##Censorship\n##Telecommunications\n##Internet infrastructure\n##War propaganda\n##Control of news outlets\n###Public relations\n###Ukraine\n###Russia\n####RT\n###Russian interference with Ukrainian media\n##Methods and resources\n###Disinformation\n####Falsehoods and adamant denials\n#####2014\n#####Malaysia Airlines Flight 17\n#####2022\n###Tropes\n###Social media\n####Access to social media\n####Attempts to censor Russian Wikipedia\n#Timeline\n##2014\n###January\n###February\n###March\n###April\n###May\n###June\n###July–August\n###October\n###December\n##2015\n###January\n###February\n###March\n###June\n##2016\n##2017\n##2018\n##2019\n##2021\n##2022\n###January\n###February\n###March\n#Staged videos\n#Results\n#Countermeasures\n##Zelenskyy\n###Propaganda in other countries\n##Memes\n#See also\n#Bibliography\n##In English\n#References\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Chris_Hipkins","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Chris_Hipkins","summary":"Christopher John Hipkins (born 5 September 1978) is a New Zealand politician who has been serving as leader of the New Zealand Labour Party since January 2023 and leader of the Opposition since November 2023. He was the 41st prime minister of New Zealand from January to November 2023, previously serving as the minister for the public service and minister for education from 2017 to 2023, and the minister for health and the COVID-19 response from 2020 to 2022. He has been the member of Parliament (MP) for Remutaka since the 2008 general election.\nHipkins was born and raised in the Hutt Valley in Wellington, and while at Victoria University of Wellington became heavily involved in student politics. He was elected president of VUWSA twice, in 2000 and 2001. Hipkins won the pre-selection for the typically safe Labour seat of Remutaka in the Hutt Valley in 2008, but due to the return of the National Party to governance won it by a thin margin. After Jacinda Ardern led Labour to victory in the 2017 general election, Hipkins assumed multiple portfolios within the Sixth Labour Government, serving variously as minister of education, police, the public service, and leader of the House. For his perceived competence within multiple roles and responsibilities, Hipkins became regarded as Labour's \"fixer\".\nAs minister of health, Hipkins was responsible for the government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand. The elimination policy became the primary focus of the 2020 election, helping Labour win in a landslide. After the victory, Hipkins took on more responsibility, serving as minister for COVID-19 response from November 2020 to June 2022. On 21 January 2023, Hipkins became the sole candidate to succeed Ardern as leader of the Labour Party after she announced her resignation. He became party leader after being elected unopposed on 22 January 2023, and was consequently appointed prime minister by the governor-general on 25 January 2023. His premiership was faced almost immediately with the 2023 Auckland Anniversary Weekend floods, and then by further flooding from Cyclone Gabrielle.

{"title":"History_of_fantasy","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/History_of_fantasy","summary":"Elements of the supernatural and the fantastic were an element of literature from its beginning. The modern fantasy genre is distinguished from tales and folklore which contain fantastic elements, first by the acknowledged fictitious nature of the work, and second by the naming of an author. Authors like George MacDonald (1824–1905) created the first explicitly fantastic works.\nLater, in the twentieth century, the publication of The Lord of the Rings by J. R. R. Tolkien enormously influenced fantasy writing, establishing the form of epic fantasy. This also did much to establish the genre of fantasy as commercially distinct and viable. Today, fantasy continues as an expansive, multi-layered milieu encompassing many subgenres, including traditional high fantasy, sword and sorcery, fairytale fantasy, and dark fantasy.","content":"#Differences between fantasy and earlier fantastic works\n#Development of fantasy\n##Romances\n##The Enlightenment\n##Romanticism\n#Modern fantasy\n##Pre-Tolkien\n##Tolkien\n##Post-Tolkien\n#References\n##Further reading\n","lang":"en"}

It is one of the two main senior baseball tournaments sanctioned by the WBSC, alongside the WBSC Premier12, but is the only one to grant the winner the title of \"world champion\".\nThe tournament, proposed in 2005 by MLB and its Players Association, was first held in 2006 as an invitational event. It previously coexisted with Olympic baseball (until 2008) and the Baseball World Cup (until 2011) as tournaments sanctioned by the International Baseball Federation, the predecessor to the WBSC. The Baseball World Cup was discontinued after the 2011 edition, when the WBSC accepted an MLB suggestion to make the WBC the officially-sanctioned world championship, on the condition that the Classic should have direct qualifications and follow international anti-doping rules.\nAfter a three-year gap between the first two installments of the tournament, plans were made for the World Baseball Classic to be repeated every four years following the 2009 event. The third installment of the Classic was held in 2013, and the fourth was held in 2017. The World Baseball Classic was held five times from 2006 to 2023, with Japan, the Dominican Republic, and the United States winning the championship. Japan, as of the 2023 tournament, is the only team to win the tournament multiple times.\nThe tournament is the first of its kind to have national teams featuring professional players from the top-level major leagues around the world, including Major League Baseball and Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB). In addition to providing a format for the best baseball players in the world to compete against one another while representing their home countries, the World Baseball Classic was created in order to further promote the game around the globe.

It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. The event took place on Saturday, May 27, 2023, at the Jeddah Super Dome in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, and was the first Night of Champions held since 2015. This was also the first Night of Champions to take place on a Saturday and the first held in Saudi Arabia, subsequently making it the ninth event that WWE held in the country under a 10-year partnership in support of Saudi Vision 2030.\nThe event was originally announced to be held as an event titled \"King and Queen of the Ring\", which would have revived the King of the Ring event series but with a rebranding, however, WWE decided to instead revive Night of Champions; King and Queen of the Ring would get rescheduled for 2024 at the same venue. This was the first Night of Champions held following the reintroduction of the brand split in July 2016 and the first to livestream on Peacock after the American version of the WWE Network merged under Peacock in March 2021. The event also replaced the previously annual Hell in a Cell event.\nThe original concept of Night of Champions (2007–2015) was that every main roster championship was contested. This theme was not retained for the 2023 event and instead celebrated the crowning of a new World Heavyweight Champion for Raw and also marked the 1,000th day for SmackDown's Roman Reigns as Universal Champion. Instead of defending his title, Reigns teamed with Solo Sikoa to challenge Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn for the Undisputed WWE Tag Team Championship in which Owens and Zayn retained. This was the final match of the night and was one of three matches promoted as part of a triple main event, the other two were the aforementioned World Heavyweight Championship match, which saw Raw's Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins defeat SmackDown's AJ Styles to become the inaugural champion in the opening bout, and a match between Cody Rhodes and Brock Lesnar, which Lesnar won via technical submission. Four other matches were contested at the event, the most prominent of which saw Asuka defeating Bianca Belair to win the Raw Women's Championship, ending Belair's record title reign at 420 days. This would be the last event for the women's championships to carry a brand name, as two weeks after the event, the Raw and SmackDown women's championships were renamed as the WWE Women's Championship and Women's World Championship, respectively.\nThe event received mostly positive reviews from critics and fans. The Undisputed WWE Tag Team Championship match and the ending that followed were deemed highlights of the night, with praise also given to the World Heavyweight Championship match.","content":"#Production\n##Background\n##Storylines\n#Event\n##Preliminary matches\n##Main event\n#Reception\n#Aftermath\n##Raw\n##SmackDown\n#Results\n##World Heavyweight Championship Tournament\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}
{"title":"Ghost_Trick:_Phantom_Detective","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ghost_Trick:_Phantom_Detective","summary":"Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective is a 2010 puzzle adventure video game developed and published by Capcom. The story follows Sissel, an amnesiac ghost with supernatural powers, and his journey to rediscover his identity. Players solve environmental puzzles, interact with eccentric characters, and uncover the truth of Sissel's death over the course of one night. Gameplay is split into two sections: gathering information by navigating through the city, and saving lives by traveling back in time.\nDirection, writing, and game design were headed by Shu Takumi, creator of the Ace Attorney franchise. Development began after the Japanese release of Trials and Tribulations in 2004, with the goal of creating a mystery beyond what the conventions of Ace Attorney had allowed. The game was announced at TGS 2009, and released for the Nintendo DS in Japan in June 2010, and in North America, Europe, and Australia in January 2011. An iOS port released in Japan in December 2010, and internationally in February 2012. An Android port was released exclusively in Japan in November 2012.\nGhost Trick was positively received, with praise for its characters, art direction, animation, music, and story, and criticism for its puzzle design and traversal mechanics. Ghost Trick was a commercial failure in Japan, leading Capcom to cite its performance as a cause for lackluster Q1 2010 revenue. The game was nominated for several industry awards, including Game of the Year by GameSpot and Nintendo Power, and has garnered a cult following.

As the longest strike in SAG-AFTRA history, its combined impact with the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike resulted in the loss of 45,000 jobs, and \"an estimated $6.5 billion\" loss to the economy of Southern California. \nAlong with the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike (which ended on September 27, 2023), it was part of a series of broader Hollywood labor disputes. Both the 2023 SAG-AFTRA and WGA strikes contributed to the biggest interruption to the American film and television industries since the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 just three years prior. In addition to standing in solidarity with the writers, the strike was led by changes in the industry caused by streaming and its effect on residuals, as well as other new technologies like AI and digital recreation. It marked the first time that actors initiated a labor dispute in the U.S. since the 1980 actors strike and the first time that actors and writers have walked out simultaneously since 1960.\nNegotiations between SAG-AFTRA and the AMPTP took place from October 2 to October 11 and resumed on October 24. On November 8, 2023, a tentative deal between the two sides was reached. Striking ended on November 9 at 12:01 a.m. PST.

{"title":"George_Meade","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/George_Meade","summary":"George Gordon Meade (December 31, 1815 – November 6, 1872) was a United States Army Major General who commanded the Army of the Potomac during the American Civil War from 1863 to 1865. He fought in many of the key battles of the Eastern theater and defeated the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia led by General Robert E. Lee at the Battle of Gettysburg.\nHe was born in Cádiz, Spain, to a wealthy Philadelphia merchant family and graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1835. He fought in the Second Seminole War and the Mexican–American War. He served in the United States Army Corps of Topographical Engineers and directed construction of lighthouses in Florida and New Jersey from 1851 to 1856 and the United States Lake Survey from 1857 to 1861.\nHis Civil War service began as brigadier general with the Pennsylvania Reserves, building defenses around Washington D.C. He fought in the Peninsula Campaign and the Seven Days Battles. He was severely wounded at the Battle of Glendale and returned to lead his brigade at the Second Battle of Bull Run. As a division commander, he won the Battle of South Mountain and assumed temporary command of the I Corps at the Battle of Antietam. Meade's division broke through the lines at the Battle of Fredericksburg but were forced to retreat due to lack of support. Meade was promoted to major general and commander of the V Corps, which he led during the Battle of Chancellorsville.\nHe was appointed to command the Army of the Potomac just three days before the Battle of Gettysburg and arrived on the battlefield after the first day's action on July 1, 1863. He organized his forces on favorable ground to fight an effective defensive battle against Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia and repelled a series of massive assaults throughout the next two days. While elated about the victory, President Abraham Lincoln was critical of Meade due to his perception of an ineffective pursuit during the retreat, which allowed Lee and his army to escape back to Virginia. Meade's troops had a minor victory in the Bristoe Campaign but a stalemate at the Battle of Mine Run. Meade's cautious approach prompted Lincoln to look for a new commander of the Army of the Potomac.\nIn 1864–1865, Meade continued to command the Army of the Potomac through the Overland Campaign, the Richmond–Petersburg Campaign, and the Appomattox Campaign, but he was overshadowed by the direct supervision of the general-in-chief, Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, who accompanied him throughout these campaigns. Grant conducted most of the strategy during these campaigns, leaving Meade with significantly less influence than before. After the war, Meade commanded the Military Division of the Atlantic from 1865 to 1866 and again from 1869 to 1872. He oversaw the formation of the state governments and reentry into the United States for five southern states through his command of the Department of the South from 1866 to 1868 and the Third Military District in 1872. Meade was subjected to intense political rivalries within the Army, notably with Major Gen. Daniel Sickles, who tried to discredit Meade's role in the victory at Gettysburg. He had a notoriously short temper which earned him the nickname of \"Old Snapping Turtle\".","content":"#Early life and education\n#Topographical Corps and Mexican-American War\n#American Civil War\n##Peninsula campaign\n##Maryland campaign\n##Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville\n##Gettysburg campaign\n###Command of the Army of the Potomac\n###Battle of Gettysburg\n###Lee's retreat\n##Bristoe and Mine Run campaign\n##Overland campaign\n##Richmond-Petersburg campaign\n##Political rivalries\n#Reconstruction\n#Personal life\n#Later life and death\n#Legacy\n##Memorials to Meade\n#In popular culture\n#Dates of rank\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

(LREM), had defeated Le Pen, leader of the National Rally, once already in the 2017 French presidential election, for the term which expired on 13 May 2022. Macron became the first president of France to win a re-election bid since Jacques Chirac won in 2002.\nIn the first round, Macron took the lead with 27.9% of votes, followed by Le Pen with 23.2%, Jean-Luc Mélenchon of La France Insoumise with 22%, and Éric Zemmour of Reconquête with 7.1%.

The first installment of The Twisted Childhood Universe (TCU), it serves as a horror retelling of A. A. Milne and E. H. Shepard's Winnie-the-Pooh books and stars Craig David Dowsett as the titular character, and Chris Cordell as Piglet, with Amber Doig-Thorne, Nikolai Leon, Maria Taylor, Natasha Rose Mills, and Danielle Ronald in supporting roles. It follows Pooh and Piglet, who have become feral murderers, as they terrorise a group of young university women and Christopher Robin when he returns to the Hundred Acre Wood five years after leaving for college.\nThe film was first announced in May 2022, when it drew widespread attention due to its premise involving a character that was a childhood icon, and it was met with divided reactions. It was produced by Jagged Edge Productions in association with ITN Studios and went into development after the 1926 Winnie-the-Pooh book entered the public domain in the United States in January 2022. The film was shot in 10 days in the Ashdown Forest of East Sussex, England, which serves as inspiration for the Hundred Acre Wood.\nWinnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey was originally set for a nationwide one-night event, but a spike in online popularity expanded it to a major worldwide theatrical release. It premiered in Mexico on 26 January 2023, and was theatrically released in the United States on 15 February 2023, and in the United Kingdom on 10 March 2023. The film was panned by critics, with many considering it one of the worst films of all time, and received five Golden Raspberry Awards, including Worst Picture.

The decision was made a day after the announcement of the Russian annexation of the DPR, LPR, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts.\nThe announcement of mobilization was seen as a significant escalation of Russia's military efforts in the war with Ukraine. Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu announced that Russia had a \"huge mobilization reserve\" and planned to mobilize 300,000 recruits. The precise details of the mobilization plans are currently unclear, however, as the exact number of people to be mobilized is classified.\nOn 28 October, Shoigu told Russian president Vladimir Putin that mobilization had been completed, which was followed an announcement by Putin of its completion. However, it has been speculated that mobilization will only end after Putin signs a relevant decree, and that covert mobilization would still occur. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov refuted this claim, but as of late December numerous military analysts and media outlets maintain that mobilization continues to take place in Russia. On 18 May 2023, the Plenary of the Supreme Court of Russia issued the Ruling No. 11 \"On the practice of consideration by the courts of criminal cases for crimes against military service\", in paragraph 2 of which it was noted that the period of mobilization (partial or general) begins from the date and time of the start of mobilization, which are established by the relevant decree of the President of the Russian Federation, and ends with the date and time of cancellation (termination) of mobilization. Thus, the court in fact confirmed that the mobilization was not completed, because the decree on its announcement was not canceled, and a separate decree on its termination was not issued.","content":"#Background\n##Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics\n##Russia\n###Russian losses\n#Prelude\n##Volunteer recruitment campaign\n##Legislative changes\n##Recruitment of prisoners\n#Putin's speech\n#Decree\n##Official publication and entry into force\n##Point 7\n#Organization\n##Text of decree\n##Citizens to be mobilized\n#Implementation\n##Dates\n#Reactions\n##In Russia\n###Markets\n###Russian officials and their families\n###Within the Russian military\n###Help for army conscripts\n###Exodus of Russians\n###Protests\n###Attacks\n##In Ukraine\n##International\n#Analysis\n##Casualties\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n","lang":"en"}

It is a standalone sequel to the 2019 film Knives Out, and the second installment in the Knives Out film series. The movie stars Daniel Craig reprising his role as master detective Benoit Blanc as he takes on a new case revolving around tech billionaire Miles Bron (played by Edward Norton) and his closest friends. The ensemble cast also includes Janelle Monáe, Kathryn Hahn, Leslie Odom Jr., Jessica Henwick, Madelyn Cline, Kate Hudson, and Dave Bautista.\nJohnson had considered several films featuring the Benoit Blanc character before the first film's release. A sequel was greenlit by its original distributor Lionsgate in 2020, but in March 2021 Netflix bought the rights to two Knives Out sequels for $469 million. The cast signed on that May. Filming took place on the island of Spetses, Greece, in June and July 2021, and continued in Belgrade, Serbia, until September.\nFollowing its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 10, 2022, Glass Onion began a one-week limited theatrical release on November 23, 2022, receiving the widest theatrical release ever for a Netflix film and grossing $15 million; Netflix began streaming it on December 23.

The film received a nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay at the 95th Academy Awards, and received numerous other accolades.\nA third film, titled Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery, is set to be released in 2025.","content":"#Plot\n#Cast\n#Production\n##Development\n##Writing\n##Casting\n##Filming\n##Music\n#Release\n##Marketing\n##Theatrical and streaming\n##Home media\n#Reception\n##Box office\n##Critical response\n##Themes\n##Accolades\n#Sequel\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}
{"title":"Seymour_Hersh","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Seymour_Hersh","summary":"Seymour Myron Hersh (born April 8, 1937) is an American investigative journalist and political writer. He gained recognition in 1969 for exposing the My Lai massacre and its cover-up during the Vietnam War, for which he received the 1970 Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting. During the 1970s, Hersh covered the Watergate scandal for The New York Times, also reporting on the secret U.S. bombing of Cambodia and the Central Intelligence Agency's (CIA) program of domestic spying. In 2004, he detailed the U.S. military's torture and abuse of prisoners at Abu Ghraib in Iraq for The New Yorker. Hersh has won a record five George Polk Awards, and two National Magazine Awards. He is the author of 11 books, including The Price of Power: Kissinger in the Nixon White House (1983), an account of the career of Henry Kissinger which won the National Book Critics Circle Award.\nIn 2013, Hersh's reporting alleged that Syrian rebel forces, rather than the government, had attacked civilians with sarin gas at Ghouta during the Syrian Civil War, and in 2015, he presented an alternative account of the U.S. special forces raid in Pakistan which killed Osama bin Laden, both times attracting controversy and criticism. In 2023, Hersh alleged that the U.S. and Norway had sabotaged the Nord Stream pipelines, again stirring controversy. He is known for his use of anonymous sources, for which his later stories in particular have been criticized.","content":"#Early life and education\n#Newspaper career\n##My Lai massacre\n##The New York Times\n#Investigative books: 1980s and 1990s\n#Later investigations\n##Iraq and Abu Ghraib\n##Iran\n##Syria and chemical attacks\n##Killing of Osama bin Laden\n##Nord Stream pipeline and Ukraine\n#Other statements\n##Speeches\n##Murder of Seth Rich\n##Pat Nixon abuse\n#Use of anonymous sources\n#Personal life\n#Awards and honors\n#Publications\n##Books\n##Articles\n#References\n##Works cited\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Gilles_de_Rais","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gilles_de_Rais","summary":"Gilles de Rais (c. 1405 – 26 October 1440), Baron de Rais, was a knight and lord from Brittany, Anjou and Poitou, a leader in the French army during the Hundred Years' War, and a companion-in-arms of Joan of Arc. He is best known for his reputation and later conviction as a confessed serial killer of children.\nIn 1429, he formed an alliance with his cousin Georges de La Trémoille, the prominent Grand Chamberlain of France, and was appointed Marshal of France the same year, after the successful military campaigns alongside Joan of Arc, but little is known about the relationship between the two comrades in arms. After the death of his former guardian and maternal grandfather Jean de Craon in 1432, and Georges de La Trémoille's fall from grace in 1433, he gradually withdrew from the war. His family accused him of squandering his patrimony by selling off his lands to the highest bidder to offset his lavish expenses, a profligacy that led to his being placed under interdict by King Charles VII of France in July 1435.\nIn May 1440, he assaulted a high-ranking cleric in the church of Saint-Étienne-de-Mer-Morte before seizing the local castle, thereby violating ecclesiastical immunities and undermining the majesty of his suzerain, John V, Duke of Brittany. Arrested on 15 September 1440 at his castle in Machecoul, he was brought to the Duchy of Brittany, an independent principality where he was tried in October 1440 by the ecclesiastical court of Nantes for heresy, sodomy and the murder of \"one hundred and forty or more children\". At the same time, he was condemned to be hanged and burned at the stake by the secular court of Nantes for his act of force at Saint-Étienne-de-Mer-Morte, as well as for crimes committed against \"several small children\". On 26 October 1440, he was sent to the scaffold with two of his servants convicted of murder.\nWhile modern historians have not sought to exonerate him or reconstitute some kind of judicial truth, some are also wary of reading the records of his trials at face value. Medievalists Jacques Chiffoleau and Claude Gauvard note the need to study the inquisitorial procedure employed by questioning the defendants' confessions in the light of the judges' expectations and conceptions, while also examining the role of rumor in the development of Gilles de Rais' fama (reputation). However, these historians do not disregard some detailed testimonies concerning the disappearance of children, or certain confessions describing murderous rituals unparalleled in the judicial archives of the time. Furthermore, Rais is sometimes believed to be an inspiration for Charles Perrault's \"Bluebeard\" literary fairy tale (1697), but this assumption is controversial as being too uncertain. Whatever the case, a popular confusion between the historical character and the mythical wife-murderer has been documented since the early 19th century.","content":"#House of Retz\n##Early life\n##Matrimonial projects\n##Family disputes\n##Titles, estates and wealth\n#Military career\n##First hypothetical feat of arms\n##Franco-Breton alliance through the House of Valois-Anjou\n##Guerilla warfare against English garrisons on the borders of Maine\n##Companion in arms with Joan of Arc\n##Civil wars between La Trémoille and Richemont's allies\n##Lifting of the siege of Lagny\n##Reduction of military commitments\n#Squandering of heritage\n#Criminal life\n##Occult involvement\n##Child murders\n##Act of force in Saint-Étienne-de-Mer-Morte\n##Ecclesiastical and secular investigations\n##Trial and execution\n#Question of guilt\n##Doubts about the verdict in the Age of Enlightenment tradition\n##Occultist interpretations\n##Georges Bataille's interpretations\n##1992 mock re-trial\n##Contemporary academic views\n#Fictional portraits\n#Psychopathological interpretations\n##Fin de siècle portrayals\n##Classification as a serial killer\n#Gilles de Rais and the Bluebeard myth\n#Relationship with Joan of Arc\n#See also\n#References\n##Notes\n##Footnotes\n##Bibliography\n###Historical studies and literary scholarship\n###Essays\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

It began on January 3, 2023, and concluded in the early morning hours of January 7 when Kevin McCarthy of California, leader of the House Republican Conference, won a majority of votes cast on the fifteenth ballot. After the longest speaker election since December 1859 – February 1860, McCarthy won the speakership by making concessions to Republican Party hardliners, who had refused to support him through several rounds of voting, finding him too weak and untrustworthy.\nRepublicans won a narrow majority of House seats over the Democratic Party in the 2022 elections. McCarthy won the nomination within the Republican conference but faced public opposition from far-right House Republicans before the vote. The opposition consisted mainly of members of the Freedom Caucus. With 19 Republicans voting for candidates other than McCarthy on the first ballot, no candidate achieved a majority and the election proceeded to additional ballots for the first time since 1923. In the first round of voting, House Democratic Caucus leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York received 212 votes, McCarthy received 203 votes, and Andy Biggs of Arizona received 10 votes; other candidates who were not formally nominated received 9 votes.\nOn the second through the fourteenth votes, McCarthy again failed to receive a majority of votes cast. Jeffries received the support of all Democrats present on each ballot. Most or all of the Republican opposition voted for Jim Jordan of Ohio on the second and third rounds and Byron Donalds of Florida on the fourth through eleventh rounds. Kevin Hern of Oklahoma and former president Donald Trump were also nominated and received votes in various rounds. On the fourth day of voting, January 6, many of the Republicans who opposed McCarthy began voting for him following negotiations between rounds. On the fifteenth and final ballot, the six remaining anti-McCarthy holdouts voted \"present\", which reduced the threshold of votes needed for a majority from 218 to 215, thus allowing McCarthy to be elected with 216 votes.","content":"#Process and conventions\n#Democratic nomination\n##Candidates\n###Nominee\n###Declined to run\n##Result\n#Republican nomination\n##Candidates\n###Nominee\n###Lost nomination\n##Results\n#Election of the speaker\n##Background\n##Candidates\n##Summary\n##Ballots 1–3 (January 3)\n##Ballots 4–6 (January 4)\n##Ballots 7–11 (January 5)\n##Ballots 12–15 (January 6)\n##All ballots: votes not cast for party nominee\n##All ballots: summary of votes\n#Impact\n##Historical context\n##Consequences while there was no speaker\n##C-SPAN popularity\n#See also\n#Notes\n","lang":"en"}
{"title":"Italian_Renaissance_sculpture","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Italian_Renaissance_sculpture","summary":"Italian Renaissance sculpture was an important part of the art of the Italian Renaissance, in the early stages arguably representing the leading edge.  The example of Ancient Roman sculpture hung very heavily over it, both in terms of style and the uses to which sculpture was put. In complete contrast to painting, there were many surviving Roman sculptures around Italy, above all in Rome, and new ones were being excavated all the time, and keenly collected. Apart from a handful of major figures, especially Michelangelo and Donatello, it is today less well-known than Italian Renaissance painting, but this was not the case at the time.\nItalian Renaissance sculpture was dominated by the north, above all by Florence. This was especially the case in the quattrocento (15th century), after which Rome came to equal or exceed it as a centre, though producing few sculptors itself. Major Florentine sculptors in stone included (in rough chronological order, with dates of death) Orcagna (1368), Nanni di Banco (1421), Filippo Brunelleschi (1446), Nanni di Bartolo (1451), Lorenzo Ghiberti (1455), Donatello (1466), Bernardo (1464) and his brother Antonio Rossellino (1479), Andrea del Verrocchio (1488), Antonio del Pollaiuolo (1498), Michelangelo (1564), and Jacopo Sansovino (1570). Elsewhere there was the Siennese Jacopo della Quercia (1438), from Lombardy Pietro Lombardo (1515) and his sons, Giovanni Antonio Amadeo (1522), Andrea Sansovino (1529), Vincenzo Danti (1576), Leone Leoni (1590), and Giambologna (1608, born in Flanders).\n\nWhile church sculpture continued to provide more large commissions than any other source, followed by civic monuments, a number of other settings for sculpture appeared or increased in prominence during the period. Secular portraits had previously mostly been funerary art, and large tomb monuments became considerably more elaborate. Relief panels were used in a number of materials and settings, or sometimes treated as portable objects like paintings. Small bronzes, usually of secular subjects, became increasingly important from the late 15th century onwards, while new forms included the medal, initially mostly presenting people rather than events, and the plaquette with a small scene in metal relief.\n\n \nThe term \"sculptor\" only came into use during the 15th century; before that sculptors were known as stonecarvers, woodcarvers and so on. Statua (\"statue\", and the art of making them) was another new Italian word, replacing medieval terms such as figura, simulacrum and imago, also used for painted images.","content":"#Periods\n#Materials\n##Stone\n##Metal\n##Wood\n##Terracotta\n##Other materials\n##Coloured sculpture\n#Settings\n##Churches and tombs\n##Civic pride\n###Fountains\n##Portraits\n###Equestrian statues\n###Shoulder busts\n###Medals\n##Small sculpture\n#Workshops\n##Women sculptors\n#Guilds\n#Patrons\n#Development of style\n##To 1400\n##From 1400\n###Doors of the Florence Baptistery\n###Donatello\n###Middle of the century\n###Lombardy\n###Crisis of the 1490s\n##16th century\n###Michelangelo\n###Mannerist and Late Renaissance sculpture\n###Giambologna\n#Italians abroad\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"History_of_Christianity","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/History_of_Christianity","summary":"The history of Christianity begins with the ministry of Jesus, a Jewish teacher and healer who was crucified and died c. AD 30–33 in Jerusalem in the Roman province of Judea. Afterwards, his followers, a set of apocalyptic Jews, proclaimed him risen from the dead. Christianity began as a Jewish sect and remained so for centuries in some locations, diverging gradually from Judaism over doctrinal, social and historical differences. In spite of the persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire, the faith spread as a grassroots movement that became established by the third-century both in and outside the empire. New Testament texts were written and church government was loosely organized in its first centuries, though the biblical canon did not become official until 382. \nConstantine the Great was the first Roman Emperor that converted to Christianity. In 313, he issued the Edict of Milan expressing tolerance for all religions. He did not make Christianity the state religion, but he did provide crucial support. Constantine called the first of seven ecumenical councils. By the Early Middle Ages, Eastern and Western Christianity had already begun to diverge, while missionary activities spread Christianity across Europe. Monks and nuns played a prominent role in establishing a Christendom that influenced every aspect of medieval life. \nFrom the ninth-century into the twelfth, politicization and Christianization went hand-in-hand in developing East-Central Europe, influencing culture, language, literacy, and literature of Slavic countries and Russia. The Byzantine Empire was more prosperous than the Western Roman Empire, and Eastern Orthodoxy was influential, however, centuries of Islamic aggression and the Crusades negatively impacted Eastern Christianity. During the High Middle Ages, Eastern and Western Christianity had grown far enough apart that differences led to the East–West Schism of 1054. Temporary reunion was not achieved until the year before the fall of Constantinople in 1453. The fall of the Byzantine Empire put an end to the institutional Christian Church in the East as established under Constantine, though it survived in altered form. \nVarious catastrophic circumstances, combined with a growing criticism of the Catholic Church in the 1300–1500s, led to the Protestant Reformation and its related reform movements. Reform, and the Catholic Counter-Reformation, were followed by the European wars of religion, the development of modern political concepts of tolerance, and the Age of Enlightenment. Christianity also influenced the New World through its connection to colonialism, its part in the American Revolution, the dissolution of slavery in the west, and the long-term impact of Protestant missions.\nIn the twenty-first century, traditional Christianity has declined in the West, while new forms have developed and expanded throughout the world. Today, there are more than two billion Christians worldwide and Christianity has become the world's largest, and most widespread religion.

{"title":"Mariupol","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mariupol","summary":"Mariupol is a city in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine. It is situated on the northern coast (Pryazovia) of the Sea of Azov, at the mouth of the Kalmius River. Prior to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, it was the tenth-largest city in the country and the second-largest city in Donetsk Oblast, with an estimated population of 425,681 people in January 2022; Ukrainian authorities estimate the current population of Mariupol at approximately 120,000. Mariupol has been occupied by Russian forces since May 2022.\nHistorically, the city of Mariupol was a centre for trade and manufacturing, and played a key role in the development of higher education and many businesses and also served as a coastal resort on the Sea of Azov. In 1948, Mariupol was renamed Zhdanov (Russian: Жданов) after Andrei Zhdanov, a native of the city who had become a high-ranking official of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and a close ally to Joseph Stalin. The name was part of a larger effort to rename cities after high-ranking political figures in the Soviet Union. The historic name was restored in 1989.\nMariupol was founded on the site of a former encampment for Cossacks, known as Kalmius, and was granted city rights within the Russian Empire in 1778. It played a key role in Stalin-era industrialization; it was a centre for grain trade, metallurgy, and heavy engineering—including the Illich Iron and Steel Works and the Azovstal Iron and Steel Works.\nBeginning on 24 February 2022, a three-month-long siege by Russian forces largely destroyed the city, for which it was named a \"Hero City of Ukraine\" by the Ukrainian government. On 16 May 2022, the last Ukrainian troops who remained in Mariupol surrendered at Azovstal Iron and Steel Works, and the Russian military secured complete control over the city by 20 May 2022.","content":"#History\n##Ancient history\n##Crimean Khanate\n##Cossack period\n##Russian Empire and Soviet Union\n##World War II\n##Russo-Ukrainian War\n###War in Donbas and economic downturn\n###2022 Russian siege and subsequent occupation\n#Geography\n##Climate\n##Ecology\n#Governance\n##City administration and local politics\n##Administrative division\n##Coat of arms\n##City holidays\n#Demographics\n##Ethnic structure\n##Language structure\n##Religious communities\n#Economy\n##Employment\n##Industry\n##Finances\n#Culture\n##Cultural institutions\n##Art and literature\n##Festivals\n#Tourism and attractions\n##Parks\n##Monuments\n#Infrastructure\n##Architecture and construction\n##Main streets\n##Transportation\n##City transport\n##Communications\n##Health service\n#Education\n#Local media\n#Public organizations\n#Sports\n#Notable people\n##Sport\n#Sister cities\n##Before 2022\n##After 2022\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"October_2022_Conservative_Party_leadership_election","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/October_2022_Conservative_Party_leadership_election","summary":"The October 2022 Conservative Party leadership election was triggered by Liz Truss's announcement that she would resign as Leader of the Conservative Party and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, amid an economic and political crisis.\nIn the July–September 2022 Conservative Party leadership election, Truss was elected to succeed Boris Johnson, who resigned after a string of controversies that severely damaged his personal reputation. Truss and her chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, announced large-scale tax cuts and borrowing in a mini-budget, which was widely criticised and largely reversed, having led to financial instability. Truss dismissed Kwarteng without explanation on 14 October and appointed Jeremy Hunt to succeed him. On the evening of 19 October, MPs voted to reject a motion which would guarantee parliamentary time for a bill to ban fracking in the UK. The vote was controversial as it was unclear whether a three-line-whip had been issued to Conservative MPs, ordering them to vote against it. Following these events, together with mounting criticism and loss of confidence in her leadership, Truss announced on 20 October her intention to resign as party leader and as prime minister, which made her the shortest-serving prime minister in British history.\nFollowing a change of rules by the 1922 Committee, each potential leader needed the support of at least 100 MPs to be a candidate in the vote, with a deadline of 2 pm on 24 October to secure enough nominations. Two candidates put their names forward: Penny Mordaunt, Leader of the House of Commons and Lord President of the Council, and Rishi Sunak, former Chancellor of the Exchequer. Johnson was expected to enter the contest; it was stated he had exceeded the required number of MP backers but nevertheless decided not to stand. On 24 October, Mordaunt withdrew from the contest less than two minutes before the deadline for nominations, leaving Sunak the only candidate in the contest and enabling him to become party leader without a ballot of MPs or party members. He assumed the premiership on 25 October. In his victory speech, Sunak paid tribute to Truss and said that she \"was not wrong\" to want to implement growth and \"admired her restlessness to create change\", but admitted that \"some mistakes were made\" and promised to place economic stability and confidence at the heart of his government's agenda.","content":"#Background\n##Boris Johnson premiership and scandals\n##Leadership election to succeed Johnson\n##Liz Truss premiership and scandals\n##Calls for Truss's resignation\n##Resignations and vote on fracking\n##Liz Truss resigns\n#Campaign\n#Election process\n#Candidates\n##Declared\n##Withdrawn\n##Explored\n##Declined\n#Endorsements\n#Responses\n#Polling\n##Conservative members\n##2019 Conservative voters\n##General population\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"The_Aesthetics_of_Resistance","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Aesthetics_of_Resistance","summary":"The Aesthetics of Resistance (German: Die Ästhetik des Widerstands, 1975–1981) is a three-volume novel by the German-born playwright, novelist, filmmaker, and painter Peter Weiss which was written over a ten-year period between 1971 and 1981. Spanning from the late 1930s into World War II, this historical novel dramatizes anti-fascist resistance and the rise and fall of proletarian political parties in Europe.  It represents an attempt to bring to life and pass on the historical and social experiences and the aesthetic and political insights of the workers' movement in the years of resistance against fascism.\nLiving in Berlin in 1937, the unnamed narrator and his peers, sixteen and seventeen-year-old working-class students, seek ways to express their hatred for the Nazi regime. They meet in art museums and galleries, and in their discussions they explore the affinity between political resistance and art, the connection at the heart of Weiss's novel. Weiss suggests that meaning lies in the refusal to renounce resistance, no matter how intense the oppression, and that it is in art that new models of political action and social understanding are to be found. The novel includes extended meditations on paintings, sculpture, and literature. Moving from the Berlin underground to the front lines of the Spanish Civil War and on to other parts of Europe, the story teems with characters, almost all of whom are based on historical figures.\nThe three volumes of the novel were originally published in 1975, 1978 and 1981. English translations of volume I and II of the novel have been published by Duke University Press, respectively in 2005 and 2020.","content":"#Plot\n#Form features and structure\n#History of origins and publication\n##Beginning\n##Research\n##Writers block\n##The third volume\n##Sweden and the GDR\n##Other translations\n#Textual forms\n#Artists and artworks in the novel\n##Divine Comedy\n##Central artworks\n##Questions\n#Reception\n##Mixed reactions in culture\n###Germany\n##Worldwide\n##Reading groups\n##Intermedial Reception\n#Radio play\n#Film\n#Musical recordings\n#See also\n#Literature\n##Thesis\n##English editions in print\n##GDR reception\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Lakota_religion","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lakota_religion","summary":"Lakota religion or Lakota spirituality is the traditional Native American religion of the Lakota people. It is practiced primarily in the North American Great Plains, within Lakota communities on reservations in North Dakota and South Dakota. The tradition has no formal leadership or organizational structure and displays much internal variation.\nCentral to Lakota religion is the concept of wakʽą, an energy or power permeating the universe. The unified totality of wakʽą is termed Wakʽą Tʽąką and is regarded as the source of all things. Lakota religionists believe that, due to their shared possession of wakʽą, humans exist in a state of kinship with all life forms, a relationship that informs adherents' behavior. The Lakota worldview includes various supernatural wakʽą beings, the wakʽąpi, who may be benevolent or malevolent towards humanity. Prayers are given to the wakʽąpi to secure their assistance, often facilitated through the smoking of a sacred pipe or the provision of offerings, usually cotton flags or tobacco. Various rituals are important to Lakota life, seven of them presented as having been given by a benevolent wakʽą spirit, White Buffalo Calf Woman. These include the sweat lodge purification ceremony, the vision quest, and the sun dance. A ritual specialist, usually called a wičháša wakhá (\"holy man\"), is responsible for healing and other tasks. The most common of these specialists is the yuwípi wičháša (yuwípi man), whose yuwípi ritual typically invokes spirits for healing.\nOne of the three main populations speaking a Sioux language, the Lakota had emerged as a distinct nation composed of seven groups by the 19th century. Many of their religious traditions reflected commonalities with those of other Sioux nations as well as non-Sioux communities like the Cheyenne. In the 1860s and 1870s, the United States government relocated most of the Lakota to the Great Sioux Reservation, where concerted efforts were made to convert them to Christianity. Most Lakota ultimately converted, although many also continued to practice certain Lakota traditions. The U.S. government also implemented measures to suppress traditional rites, for instance banning the sun dance in 1883, although traditional perspectives were documented in the 19th and early 20th centuries by practitioners like Black Elk. Encouraged by the American Indian Movement, the 1960s and 1970s saw revitalization efforts to revive Lakota traditional religion. In the late 20th century, Lakota practices increasingly influenced other Native American religions across North America.\nMany Lakota practice their traditional religion alongside Christianity, typically Catholicism, Episcopalianism, or the peyote religion of the Native American Church.  For these individuals, Wakʽą Tʽąką is often identified with the Christian God. Lakota traditions have also been adopted by many non-Native Americans, especially New Agers, a tendency condemned by some Lakota spokespeople as cultural appropriation.","content":"#Definition and classification\n#Beliefs\n##Wakʽą and Wakʽą Tʽąką\n##Wakʽąpi\n##Cosmogony\n##Spirit and afterlife\n##Animism and kinship\n###Šicųpi and wašicu\n##Cosmology and the sacred hoop\n##Morality and gender roles\n#Practices\n##Prayer and offerings\n###Suffering and sacrifice\n##The sacred pipe\n##Sweat lodge\n##Vision quest\n##Sun dance\n##Further rites\n##Healing and cursing\n##Holy men\n###Yuwípi and yuwípi wičháša\n###Other specialists\n#History\n##Prehistory\n##Encounters with Christianity and colonialism\n##Revivalism\n#Demographics\n#Reception and influence\n#References\n##Citations\n##Sources\n","lang":"en"}

He had run for the seat in 2020 but was defeated by incumbent Democratic Rep. Tom Suozzi. Suozzi opted against seeking re-election in 2022, and Santos ran for Congress again. That time, Santos prevailed, defeating Democrat Robert Zimmerman. Santos, who is gay, was the first Republican to be openly LGBT before being elected to Congress.\nWithin six weeks of Santos's election, news outlets began reporting that much of his biography appeared to be fabricated. Santos admitted to having lied about his education and employment history, while his disclosures about his business activities, income, and personal wealth were inconsistent with one another. Further, Santos had not disclosed his criminal history or the existence of lawsuits against him. Santos was sworn in as a member of the House in January 2023, but faced ongoing media scrutiny as well as demands for his resignation from members of both parties.\nOn December 1, 2023, following an investigation by the House Ethics Committee and a federal indictment, the House of Representatives voted 311–114 to expel Santos. Santos is the first member of the House expelled without having previously been convicted of a crime or having fought for the Confederacy. He is also the sixth member of the House to be expelled and the first Republican. In August 2024, Santos pleaded guilty to identity theft and wire fraud.","content":"#Early life, family, and education\n##In Brazil\n#Early career\n##Harbor City Capital\n##Devolder Organization\n#Early political activities\n#U.S. House of Representatives\n##Elections\n###2020 campaign\n###Refusal to accept election results\n###2022 campaign\n###2024 campaign\n##Tenure\n##Expulsion resolutions\n#Political positions\n#False biographical statements\n##Family\n###Mother\n##Education\n##Employment\n##Residence\n##Victimhood\n##Health\n##Charitable work\n#Campaign finance\n##Financial disclosures\n##Campaign spending\n##Donations to other candidates\n##Unitemized expenses\n##Il Bacco restaurant\n##Political action committee\n##FEC investigations\n###Campaign treasurer\n##Alleged use of fictitious donors and donations\n##Alleged credit card fraud and misuse of WinRed\n##Misrepresentations in fundraising\n##Red Strategies and RedStone Strategies\n##Rise NY\n#Investigations and legal issues\n##House Ethics Committee\n##Brazilian check fraud charges\n##Evictions and unpaid judgments\n##Friends of Pets United\n###Theft charges\n###Allegations of mishandling funds\n##Credit-card skimming\n##Sexual harassment allegation\n#Federal indictment\n##Superseding indictment\n##Guilty plea\n#Post-congressional career\n#Personal life\n#In popular culture\n#Electoral history\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Works cited\n#Further reading\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

It focuses on Amleth, a Viking prince who sets out on a quest to avenge the murder of his father. The film is heavily influenced by Norse mythology.\nSkarsgård had wanted to make a Viking film for several years, and Eggers decided to make the film his third project after the pair met to discuss possible collaborations. Much of the cast joined in October 2019, and filming took place in locations throughout Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland and Iceland from August to December 2020.\nThe Northman premiered in Stockholm at Rigoletto Cinema on March 28, 2022. It began theatrical release in some countries on April 13, 2022, and was released theatrically in the United States on April 22 to positive critical reception.

Another rough definition of the region is the area south of the 36th parallel. Several climates can be found in the region—desert\/semi-desert (Eastern California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, and West Texas), Mediterranean (California), humid subtropical (Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas), and tropical (South Florida).\nThe Sun Belt has seen substantial population growth post-World War II from an influx of people seeking a warm and sunny climate, a surge in retiring baby boomers, and growing economic opportunities. The advent of air conditioning created more comfortable summer conditions and allowed more manufacturing and industry to locate in the Sun Belt. Since much of the construction in the Sun Belt is new or recent, housing styles and design are often modern and open. Recreational opportunities in the Sun Belt are often not tied strictly to one season, and many tourist and resort cities in the region support a tourist industry all year.","content":"#Migration\n#Definition\n#Projections\n#Politics\n#Environment\n#Major cities\n#See also\n#References\n#Further reading\n","lang":"en"}

From its position along the Quebec City–Windsor Corridor, the city has attracted investment in commerce, culture and manufacturing, and attracted criminal enterprises to exploit that growth.\nLondon has seen the establishment of Canadian chapters of the Ku Klux Klan, planned bank robberies, and in modern times, the establishment of a variety of crime syndicates, street gangs, outlaw motorcycle clubs and nationalist groups.","content":"#Overview\n#Early history\n##Bank robbers\n##Motorcycle clubs\n#Major events\n##History of the London Klan\n##Ontario Biker War\n##London conflict\n#Events by year\n##1882\n##1920\n##1931\n##1940\n##1977\n##1978\n##1979\n##1980\n##1985\n##1987\n##1989\n##1992\n##1998\n##1999\n##2000\n##2001\n##2002\n##The 2002 London Motorcycle Show\n##2005\n##2007\n##2009\n##2011\n##2012\n##2014\n##2015\n##2020\n#Groups, street gangs and crime syndicates\n##Annihilators Motorcycle Club\n##Bandidos Motorcycle Club\n##Boullee Boys\n##Black Shirts Gang (BSG)\n##EOA (East Of Adelaide)\n##Filthy 15 Motorcycle Club\n##First Division\n##FU Crew\n##Gate Keepers Motorcycle Club\n##Hells Angels Motorcycle Club\n##H-Block\n##Outlaws Motorcycle Club\n##Juggalo Gang\n##Jackels Motorcycle Club\n##Kipps Lane Crew\n##Ku Klux Klan: London chapter\n##Loners Motorcycle Club\n##Ontario Wide Crew\n##Pond Mills Crew\n##Satan's Choice\n##The Wheeled Bandits\n##Queensman Motorcycle Club\n##The Crew\n#See also\n#Books\n#References\n##Sources\n","lang":"en"}

It elected 90 members to the Northern Ireland Assembly. It was the seventh assembly election since the establishment of the assembly in 1998. The election was held three months after the Northern Ireland Executive collapsed due to the resignation of the First Minister, Paul Givan of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), in protest against the Northern Ireland Protocol.\nIn the sixth assembly, elected in 2017, eight parties had Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs): the DUP, latterly led by Jeffrey Donaldson; Sinn Féin, led by Michelle O'Neill; the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), latterly led by Doug Beattie; the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), led by Colum Eastwood; Alliance, led by Naomi Long; the Greens, led by Clare Bailey; People Before Profit (PBP), which has a collective leadership; and the Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV), led by Jim Allister.\nSinn Féin became the largest party, marking the first time an Irish nationalist\/republican party won the most seats in an assembly election in Northern Ireland, and has the right to nominate Northern Ireland's first nationalist First Minister. The DUP's vote share dropped almost 7% and it lost three seats; despite this, unionists won two more seats than nationalists—37 seats to 35—and a marginally higher share of the vote. Alliance made large gains, as the only party to gain seats at the election, overtaking the UUP and the SDLP to become the third-largest party in the Assembly. The Greens lost both seats they held before the election and were unrepresented in the Assembly for the first time since 2003.\nAs Northern Ireland's government is based on power-sharing, the DUP (the largest unionist party) was required to nominate a deputy First Minister for the Executive to be formed and the Assembly to conduct business; however, they refused to do so due to their opposition to the Northern Ireland Protocol and post-Brexit trading arrangements. It wasn't until 31 January 2024 that the DUP and UK Government announced a deal had been struck to revive the Executive, and on 3 February 2024 the Assembly swore in Sinn Fein First Minister Michelle O'Neill and DUP deputy First Minister Emma Little-Pengelly.","content":"#Background\n##Electoral events\n##Leadership changes\n##Northern Ireland Protocol\n##Calls for early election\n#Candidates\n#Members not seeking re-election\n#Campaign\n#Opinion polls\n#Results\n##Distribution of seats by constituency\n##Share of first-preference votes\n##Incumbents defeated\n#Aftermath\n#See also\n#Footnotes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

Two of the storms crossed into the basin from the Atlantic. In the central North Pacific basin (between 140°W and the International Date Line), no tropical cyclones formed (for the third consecutive season). The season officially began on May 15 in the eastern Pacific, and on June 1 in the central; both ended on November 30. These dates historically describe the period each year when most tropical cyclogenesis occurs in these regions of the Pacific and are adopted by convention.\nThe first named storm of the season, Hurricane Agatha, formed on May 28, and made landfall two days later at Category 2 strength on the Saffir–Simpson scale, making it the strongest hurricane on record to make landfall during the month of May in the Eastern Pacific basin. In June, Hurricane Blas and Tropical Storm Celia caused heavy rainfall over southwestern Mexico despite remaining offshore. The season's first major hurricane, Hurricane Bonnie, moved offshore Nicaragua as a tropical storm on July 2, becoming the first storm to survive the crossover from the Atlantic to the Pacific intact since Hurricane Otto in 2016. In September, tropical storms Javier, Lester, and Madeline all caused flooding across the Pacific coast of Mexico, though none left severe damage. Hurricane Kay also formed that month, and struck the Baja California Peninsula before bringing gale-force winds to the west coast of the continental United States, becoming the first Pacific hurricane to do so since Hurricane Nora 25 years earlier. \nIn early October, Hurricane Orlene became a Category 4 hurricane before weakening and making landfall in Sinaloa as a Category 1 hurricane, resulting in heavy rainfall and flooding. Also, Hurricane Julia became the second storm of the season to cross over from the Atlantic basin intact, and made landfall in El Salvador soon thereafter.

The North Indian basin produced 7 named storms, which constituted above average activity, however only one strengthened to cyclone strength. The Southern Hemisphere also featured average activity, with Cyclone Batsirai causing heavy damage and killing many people in Madagascar. Throughout the year, 18 major tropical cyclones formed, which included three Category 5 tropical cyclones, both figures being below the 1991-2020 global averages. The accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) index for 2022 (seven basins combined), as calculated by Colorado State University (CSU) was 559.6 units overall, which was the fewest number of units seen since 2010.\nTropical cyclones are primarily monitored by ten warning centers across the world, which are designated as a Regional Specialized Meteorological Center (RSMC) or a Tropical Cyclone Warning Center (TCWC) by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). These ten centers are the National Hurricane Center (NHC) and the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC), Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), Météo-France (MFR), Indonesia's Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysical Agency (BMKG), the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM), Papua New Guinea's National Weather Service (PNGNWS), the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS), and New Zealand's MetService. Unofficial, but still notable, warning centres include the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA; albeit official within the Philippines), the United States's Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), and the Brazilian Navy Hydrographic Center.","content":"#Global atmospheric and hydrological conditions\n#Summary\n##North Atlantic Ocean\n##Eastern & Central Pacific Ocean\n##Western Pacific Ocean\n##North Indian Ocean\n##South-West Indian Ocean\n###January - June\n###July - December\n##Australian Region\n###January - June\n###July - December\n##South Pacific Ocean\n###January - June\n###July - December\n##South Atlantic Ocean\n#Systems\n##January\n##February\n##March\n##April\n##May\n##June\n##July\n##August\n##September\n##October\n##November\n##December\n#Global effects\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Cataract_surgery","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cataract_surgery","summary":"Cataract surgery, also called lens replacement surgery, is the removal of the natural lens of the eye that has developed a cataract, an opaque or cloudy area. The eye's natural lens is usually replaced with an artificial intraocular lens (IOL) implant.\nOver time, metabolic changes of the crystalline lens fibres lead to the development of a cataract, causing impairment or loss of vision. Some infants are born with congenital cataracts, and environmental factors may lead to cataract formation. Early symptoms may include strong glare from lights and small light sources at night and reduced visual acuity at low light levels.\nDuring cataract surgery, the cloudy natural lens is removed from the posterior chamber, either by emulsification in place or by cutting it out. An IOL is usually implanted in its place (PCIOL), or less frequently in front of the chamber, to restore useful focus. Cataract surgery is generally performed by an ophthalmologist in an out-patient setting at a surgical centre or hospital. Local anaesthesia is normally used; the procedure is usually quick and causes little or no pain and minor discomfort. Recovery sufficient for most daily activities usually takes place in days, and full recovery takes about a month.\nWell over 90% of operations are successful in restoring useful vision, and there is a low complication rate. Day care, high-volume, minimally invasive, small-incision phacoemulsification with quick post-operative recovery has become the standard of care in cataract surgery in the developed world. Manual small incision cataract surgery (MSICS), which is considerably more economical in time, capital equipment, and consumables, and provides comparable results, is popular in the developing world. Both procedures have a low risk of serious complications, and are the definitive treatment for vision impairment due to lens opacification.","content":"#Uses\n#Techniques\n#Pre-operative evaluation\n##Contraindications\n##Selection of intraocular lenses\n#Operation procedures\n##Preparation\n##Anaesthesia\n##Phacoemulsification\n##Manual small incision cataract surgery (MSICS)\n##Extracapsular cataract extraction\n##Converting to ECCE to manage a contingency\n##Closing the wound\n#Post-operative care\n#Complications\n##During surgery\n##After surgery\n##Risk\n#Recovery and rehabilitation\n#Outcomes\n#History\n#Accessibility\n##Europe\n##Asia\n##Africa\n##Latin America\n#Social, economic and environmental relevance\n#Special populations\n##Congenital cataracts\n##Higher risk for operations on separate occasions\n#Other animals\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

Diversions from official channels and clandestine supply chains fed the black market. It came to be seen as \"an essential means for survival, as popular resistance to state tyranny invading daily life, as a system for German exploitation, and as a means for unscrupulous producers and dealers to profit from French misery.\" It involved smugglers, organized crime and other underworld figures, union leaders and corrupt military and police officials. It later became a civil disobedience movement against rationing and attempts to centralize distribution, then eventually evading Nazi food restrictions became a national pastime. Those who could not, such as long-term psychiatric patients, simply did not survive.\nVichy market regulation was the first French attempt at economic planning. The parallel economy undermined the official centralized attempts to regulate the production, storage, transport, quantity, quality and price of food. Even after the liberation of France and the end of the Second World War, problems with supply kept rationing and the black market in operation until 1949.","content":"#Background\n##1930s: inflation, instability and unrest\n##Fall of France\n#1940-1941\n##Origins\n###Rationing and price controls\n###Diversion from official channels\n###Clandestine networks\n###Hidden stockpiling\n###Grey market\n##Users of the black market\n###Privileged French\n###Occupation forces\n##Public response\n###Early condemnation\n###Participation\n###Housewives' demonstrations\n###Suspicions of hoarding\n###Official antisemitism\n###Public opinion\n###Political opposition\n##Response by authorities\n#Widespread black market (autumn 1941 to 1943)\n##Agricultural black market\n##Grey market: direct sales\n##Commerce and industry\n##Tacit tolerance\n###No longer immoral\n###Nuanced and refocused enforcement\n##Metrics\n###Proportion of production\n###Higher and more volatile prices\n###Geographic distribution\n###Beneficiaries\n#Patriotism (spring 1943-summer 1944)\n##Enforcement for the occupiers\n###Economic pillage and the end of the German black market\n###Countermeasures and collaboration\n###Milice vs the black market\n##Fraud and Resistance\n###Resistance encouragement\n###Blaming the Resistance\n###End of the occupation\n#After the Liberation (1944-1949)\n##Épuration and illicit profits\n###Pursuit and punishment\n###Confiscation of illicit profits\n##Continued black market operations\n###Continued trafficking\n###Generalized fraud\n###Government powerlessness\n###Towards the free market\n#Historical memory\n##Historiography\n##Collective unconscious and cultural roots\n###Early recollections\n###Marcel Aymé\n##Major works\n###La Traversée de Paris\n###Au bon beurre\n##Historical figures\n###L'Étrange Monsieur Joseph\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n##Citations\n##Bibliography\n#Further reading\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Liz_Truss","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Liz_Truss","summary":"Mary Elizabeth Truss (born 26 July 1975) is a British politician who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and Leader of the Conservative Party from September to October 2022. On her fiftieth day in office, she stepped down amid a government crisis, making her the shortest-serving prime minister in British history. The member of Parliament (MP) for South West Norfolk from 2010 to 2024, Truss held various Cabinet positions under three prime ministers—David Cameron, Theresa May and Boris Johnson—lastly as foreign secretary from 2021 to 2022. \nTruss studied philosophy, politics and economics at Merton College, Oxford, and was the president of the Oxford University Liberal Democrats. In 1996 she joined the Conservative Party. She worked at Royal Dutch Shell and Cable & Wireless and was the deputy director of the think tank Reform. After two unsuccessful attempts to be elected to the House of Commons, she became the MP for South West Norfolk at the 2010 general election. As a backbencher she called for reform in several policy areas including the economy, childcare and mathematics in education. Truss co-founded the Free Enterprise Group of Conservative MPs and wrote or co-wrote a number of papers and books, including After the Coalition and Britannia Unchained.\nTruss was the parliamentary under-secretary of state for childcare and education from 2012 to 2014 before Cameron appointed her secretary of state for the environment, food and rural affairs in a cabinet reshuffle. Although she campaigned for the UK to remain in the European Union, Truss supported Brexit following the outcome of the 2016 referendum. Following Cameron's resignation in 2016 his successor, Theresa May, appointed her secretary of state for justice and lord chancellor, making Truss the first woman to serve as lord chancellor in the office's thousand-year history; in the aftermath of the 2017 general election she was demoted to chief secretary to the Treasury. After May announced her resignation in May 2019 Truss supported Johnson's successful bid to become Conservative leader and prime minister. He appointed Truss secretary of state for international trade and president of the Board of Trade in July and subsequently to the additional role of minister for women and equalities in September. Johnson promoted Truss to foreign secretary in the 2021 cabinet reshuffle; during her time in the position she led negotiations on the Northern Ireland Protocol and the UK's response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\nIn September 2022 Truss defeated Rishi Sunak in a leadership election to succeed Johnson, who had resigned because of an earlier government crisis, and was appointed as prime minister by Elizabeth II two days before the monarch's death; her government's business was subsequently suspended during a national mourning period of ten days. In response to the rising cost of living and increased energy prices, her ministry announced the Energy Price Guarantee. The government then announced large-scale tax cuts and borrowing, which led to financial instability and were largely reversed. Facing mounting criticism and loss of confidence in her leadership, Truss announced her resignation as leader of the Conservative Party on 20 October. Sunak was elected unopposed as her successor, and appointed prime minister on 25 October. After spending the duration of Sunak's premiership on the backbenches, Truss lost her seat at the 2024 general election.","content":"#Early life and education (1975–1996)\n#Career\n##Employment and candidatures (1996–2010)\n##Backbencher (2010–2012)\n##Education under-secretary (2012–2014)\n##Environment secretary (2014–2016)\n##Justice secretary and lord chancellor (2016–2017)\n##Chief secretary to the Treasury (2017–2019)\n##International trade secretary (2019–2021)\n##Foreign secretary (2021–2022)\n###Leadership election (July–September 2022)\n#Premiership (2022)\n##Cabinet and death of Elizabeth II\n##Domestic policies and mini-budget\n##Government crisis and resignation\n#Post-premiership (2022–present)\n#Political positions\n##Domestic issues\n##Foreign policy\n#Notes and references\n#Sources\n##Books and journals\n##News\n##Websites and others\n#Further reading\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"2023_Canadian_wildfires","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2023_Canadian_wildfires","summary":"Beginning in March 2023, and with increased intensity starting in June, Canada was affected by a record-setting series of wildfires. All 13 provinces and territories were affected, with large fires in Alberta, British Columbia, the Northwest Territories, Nova Scotia, Ontario, and Quebec. The 2023 wildfire season had the most area burned in Canada's recorded history, surpassing the 1989, 1995, and 2014 fire seasons, as well as in recorded North American history, surpassing the 2020 Western US wildfire season.  \nAs of October 6, 6,551 fires had burned 184,961 square kilometres (71,414 sq mi), about 5% of the entire forest area of Canada, and more than six times the long-term average of 27,300 square kilometres (10,541 sq mi) for that time of the year. As of mid-October, the total area burnt was more than 2.5 times the previous record. Eight firefighters were killed, and 185,000 to 232,000 people were displaced, including 16,400 in Nova Scotia's capital of Halifax, 21,720 in the Northwest Territories capital of Yellowknife, and almost 30,000 in British Columbia's Kelowna and West Kelowna. Thousands of international firefighters travelled to Canada to combat the fires.\nSmoke emitted from the wildfires caused air quality alerts and evacuations in Canada and the United States. In late June, the smoke crossed the Atlantic Ocean, reaching Europe. Many of the largest fires were under control by July, including fires which had funnelled smoke into the Eastern Seaboard. However, significant fires continued well into the fall season, with several major fires breaking out in September. Moderate-to-severe drought conditions from British Columbia to northern Ontario also continued into fall. Though most of the fires were extinguished by winter, some in northern Alberta and British Columbia continued to smoulder in peat, reigniting the following February and starting the 2024 fires.","content":"#Background\n#Wildfires\n##Alberta\n###High Level Forest Area\n##British Columbia\n##Manitoba\n##New Brunswick\n##Newfoundland and Labrador\n##Northwest Territories\n##Nova Scotia\n###Barrington Lake wildfire\n###Tantallon wildfire\n##Ontario\n##Quebec\n##Saskatchewan\n#Domestic impacts\n##Evacuations\n###Alberta evacuations\n###British Columbia evacuations\n###Manitoba evacuations\n###Northwest Territories evacuations\n###Nova Scotia evacuations\n###Quebec evacuations\n###Saskatchewan evacuations\n##Other domestic impacts\n###Economic\n###Political\n#International effects\n##Effects on environment and climate\n##United States\n###May\n###June\n##Europe\n#Fatalities\n#Domestic government responses\n##In Alberta\n##In British Columbia\n##In Manitoba\n##In the Northwest Territories\n##In Nova Scotia\n###Financial relief\n###Aftermath\n##In Saskatchewan\n##Government strategies for future fires\n#Other reactions\n##International responses\n##Facebook blocking wildfire news stories\n##Conspiracy theories\n#Fire progression\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}
{"title":"North_Kosovo_crisis_(2022–2024)","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/North_Kosovo_crisis_(2022–2024)","summary":"Beginning on 31 July 2022, tensions between Kosovo and Serbia heightened due to the expiration of the eleven-year validity period of documents for cars on 1 August 2022, between the government of Kosovo and the Serbs in North Kosovo. Kosovo, which declared independence in 2008, signed an agreement with Serbia in 2011 that determined the use of license plates in North Kosovo. This agreement was supposed to change license plates from the ones that were issued by Serbia to neutral ones. The agreement for the change was extended in 2016 and expired in 2021, which led to a crisis in 2021 that ended with an agreement to terminate the ban of Kosovo-issued license plates in Serbia.\nAfter a Kosovo announcement that Serbian citizens who enter Kosovo will receive entry and exit documents, a number of barricades were created in North Kosovo on 31 July 2022 but were removed two days later after Kosovo announced that it would postpone the ban on license plates issued by Serbia. In August 2022, unsuccessful negotiations regarding license plates were held, although the ID document dispute was solved. A proposed agreement, dubbed the \"German-French proposal\" by the media, would be the basis of consultations beginning in January 2023.\nAlbin Kurti declined to postpone the deadline for license plates and instead announced a phased implementation that would run from November 2022 until April 2023. Before this began, a number of Kosovo Serb police officers, mayors, judges, and Serb List members of parliament resigned from government institutions. Kosovo and Serbia negotiated again in November 2022 and they had found an agreement on 23 November 2022 which settled that license plates that Serbia issued would continue to be in use in North Kosovo.\nKosovo formally signed an application to seek candidate status for European Union membership on 14 December 2022, its impending signature resulted in a number of barricades being set up in North Kosovo on 10 December; they were dismantled on 30 December. In Serbia, far-right groups staged protests in support of Kosovo Serbs. In December 2022, Serbia submitted a request to Kosovo Force for the deployment of up to 1,000 Serbian military and police forces in Kosovo, which ended up being rejected in January 2023.\nIn April local elections were held, boycotted by ethnic Serbs. Based on an extremely low number of votes, ethnic Albanian mayors were elected. On 26 May 2023, Kosovo took control of the North Kosovo municipal buildings by force, to enable the newly elected ethnic Albanian mayors to physically assume office. A civil disturbance occurred, and Serbia put its armed forces on alert. The decision of Kosovo to use force was condemned by the United States and the EU. With mayors unable to perform their duties, in July Kosovo announced that new mayor elections will be held.\nFrom 1 January 2024 Serbia implemented the 2011 agreement and recognised Kosovo license plates.","content":"#Background\n#Timeline\n##2022\n###July\n###August\n###September\n###October\n###November\n###December\n##2023\n###January\n###February\n###March\n###April\n###May\n###June\n###July\n###September\n###October\n###November\n###December\n##2024\n###February\n###August\n#Reactions\n#See also\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Battle_of_Bakhmut","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Battle_of_Bakhmut","summary":"The battle of Bakhmut was a major battle between the Russian Armed Forces and the Ukrainian Armed Forces for control of the city of Bakhmut, during the eastern Ukraine campaign, a theatre of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. It is regarded by some military analysts to be the bloodiest battle since the end of World War II.\nWhile the shelling of Bakhmut began in May 2022, and the battle being considered to have begun in early July with Russian offensives on the distant approaches to the city, the main assault towards the city itself started on 1 August after Russian forces advanced from the direction of Popasna following a Ukrainian withdrawal from that front. The main assault force consisted primarily of mercenaries from the Russian paramilitary organization Wagner Group, supported by regular Russian troops and reportedly Donetsk People's Republic militia elements.\nIn late 2022, following Ukraine's Kharkiv and Kherson counteroffensives, the Bakhmut–Soledar front became an important focus of the war, being one of the few front lines where Russia remained on the offensive. Attacks on the city intensified in November 2022, as assaulting Russian forces were reinforced by units redeployed from the Kherson front, together with newly mobilized recruits. By this time, much of the front line had descended into positional trench warfare, with both sides suffering high casualties without any significant advances. By using repeated assaults composed of former convicts, Wagner troops were able to gradually gain ground. and by February 2023, they captured territory in the north and south of Bakhmut and threatened encirclement, forcing Ukrainian forces to slowly pull out into the city, and the battle turned into fierce urban warfare. By March 2023, Russian forces captured the eastern half of the city, up to the Bakhmutka river, and continued to advance into Ukrainian-controlled parts of Bakhmut.\nOn 20 May 2023, Bakhmut had been mostly captured by Russian forces, with the Ukrainian military claiming control of a small strip of the city proper along the T0504 highway. Nonetheless, Ukraine started counterattacks on Russia's flanks, seeking to encircle the city.  Around the same time on 25 May, Wagner began withdrawing from the city to be replaced by regular Russian troops, amidst heavy internal squabbles between Wagner leadership and Russian high command.\nIn September 2023, President Zelensky said Ukraine would continue to fight to retake Bakhmut.\nAlthough, initially a target with lesser tactical importance, Bakhmut became one of the central battles of the Russo-Ukrainian War, with it gaining significant symbolic importance for both sides, as President Zelensky declared it to be the \"fortress of our morale\", and due to the heavy investment of manpower and resources both sides used to control the city. The battle of Bakhmut has been described as a \"meat grinder\" and a \"vortex\" for both the Ukrainian and Russian militaries. The intensity of the battle and the high number of casualties suffered by both sides during the fight, alongside the trench and urban warfare, has drawn comparisons to the Battle of Verdun in World War I, as well as to the Battle of Stalingrad in World War II. It has been called the most prominent urban battle of the war, with it being reported as the site of \"some of the fiercest urban combat in Europe since World War II\".","content":"#Background\n#Battle\n##Early shelling and Russian encroachment (August–October 2022)\n##Early winter escalation (November–December 2022)\n##Capture of Soledar and partial encirclement (January–April 2023)\n##Ukrainian flanking counterattacks begin (May 2023)\n##Capture of Bakhmut and Wagner withdrawal (20 May–early June 2023)\n#Military strength and tactics\n#Aftermath\n##Strategic value\n##Battlefield conditions\n##Casualties\n###Military casualties\n###Civilian casualties\n##Attrition\n##Result\n#Allegations of war crimes\n#See also\n#Notes\n","lang":"en"}

In a career spanning 80 years, she played various roles across film, stage, and television. Although based for much of her life in the United States, her work attracted international attention.\nLansbury was born into an upper-middle-class family in central London, the daughter of Irish actress Moyna Macgill and English politician Edgar Lansbury. To escape the Blitz, she moved to the United States in 1940, studying acting in New York City. Proceeding to Hollywood in 1942, she signed with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) and obtained her first film roles, in Gaslight (1944), National Velvet (1944), and The Picture of Dorian Gray (1945). She appeared in 11 further MGM films, mostly in minor roles, and after her contract ended in 1952, she began to supplement her cinematic work with theatrical appearances. Lansbury was largely seen as a B-list star during this period, but her role in The Manchurian Candidate (1962) received widespread acclaim and is frequently ranked as one of her best performances. Moving into musical theatre, Lansbury gained stardom for playing the leading role in the Broadway musical Mame (1966), winning her first Tony Award and becoming a gay icon.\nAmid difficulties in her personal life, Lansbury moved from California to Ireland's County Cork in 1970. She continued to make theatrical and cinematic appearances throughout that decade, including leading roles in the stage musicals Gypsy, Sweeney Todd, and The King and I, as well as in the Disney film Bedknobs and Broomsticks (1971). Moving into television in 1984, she achieved worldwide fame as the sleuth Jessica Fletcher in the American whodunit series Murder, She Wrote, which ran for twelve seasons until 1996, becoming one of the longest-running and most popular detective drama series in television history. Through Corymore Productions, a company that she co-owned with her husband Peter Shaw, Lansbury assumed ownership of the series and was its executive producer during its final four seasons. She also moved into voice work, contributing to animated films like Beauty and the Beast (1991) and Anastasia (1997). In the 21st century, she toured in several theatrical productions and appeared in family films such as Nanny McPhee (2005) and Mary Poppins Returns (2018).\nAmong her numerous accolades were six Tony Awards (including a Lifetime Achievement Award), six Golden Globe Awards, a Laurence Olivier Award, and the Academy Honorary Award, in addition to nominations for three Academy Awards, eighteen Primetime Emmy Awards, and a Grammy Award.","content":"#Early life and career beginnings\n##Childhood: 1925–1942\n##Career breakthrough: 1942–1945\n##Later MGM films: 1945–1951\n#Mid career\n##The Manchurian Candidate and minor roles: 1952–1965\n##Mame and theatrical stardom: 1966–1969\n##Ireland and Gypsy: 1970–1978\n##Sweeney Todd and continued cinematic work: 1979–1984\n#Global fame\n##Murder, She Wrote: 1984–2003\n##Final years: 2003–2022\n#Personal life\n#Honours and legacy\n#Publications\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n##Citations\n##General and cited sources\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Alexander_Suvorov","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Alexander_Suvorov","summary":"Count Alexander Vasilyevich Suvorov-Rymniksky, Prince of Italy (24 November [O.S. 13 November] 1729 or 1730 – 18 May [O.S. 6 May] 1800) was a Russian general and military theorist in the service of the Russian Empire. \nBorn in Moscow, he studied military history as a young boy and joined the Imperial Russian Army at the age of 17. Promoted to colonel in 1762 for his successes during the Seven Years' War, his victories during the War of the Bar Confederation included the capture of Kraków and victories at Orzechowo, Lanckorona, and Stołowicze. His reputation rose further when, in the Russo-Turkish War of 1768–1774, he captured Turtukaya twice and won a decisive victory at Kozludzha. After a period of little progress, he was promoted to general and led Russian forces in the Russo-Turkish War of 1787–1792, participating in the siege of Ochakov, as well as victories at Kinburn and Focșani. \nSuvorov won a decisive victory at the Battle of Rymnik, and afterwards defeated the Ottomans in the storming of Izmail. His victories at Focșani and Rymnik established him as the most brilliant general in Russia, if not in all of Europe. In 1794, he put down the Polish uprising, defeating them at the battle of Praga and elsewhere. After Catherine the Great died in 1796, her successor Paul I often quarrelled with Suvorov. After a period of ill-favour, Suvorov was recalled to a field marshal position at the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars. He was given command of the Austro-Russian army, and after a series of victories, such as the battle of the Trebbia, he captured Milan and Turin, and nearly erased all of Napoleon's Italian conquests of 1796–97. After an Austro-Russian army was defeated in Switzerland, Suvorov, ordered to reinforce them, was cut off by André Masséna and later surrounded in the Swiss Alps. His successful extraction of the exhausted, ill-supplied, and heavily-outnumbered Russian army was rewarded by a promotion to Generalissimo. Masséna himself would later confess that he would exchange all of his victories for Suvorov's passage of the Alps. Suvorov died in 1800 of illness in Saint Petersburg. He was instrumental in expanding the Russian Empire, as his success ensured Russia's conquering of Kuban, Crimea, and New Russia.\nOne of the foremost generals in all of military history, and considered the greatest military commander in Russian history, Suvorov has been compared to Napoleon in military generalship. Undefeated, he has been described as the best general Republican France ever fought, and noted as \"one of those rare generals who were consistently successful despite suffering from considerable disadvantages.\" Suvorov was also admired by his soldiers throughout his whole military life, and was respected for his honest service and truthfulness.","content":"#Early life\n##Origins\n##Childhood\n#Early career\n##First military experience\n##1761\n##Freemasonry, Berlin\n#Wars against Poland–Lithuania\n##Dissolution of the Bar Confederation (1768–1772)\n###Outbreak of war and setbacks\n###Retaliatory strike\n##Battles against Polish uprising (1794)\n###Turning victories\n###Triumph and tragedy in Praga\n###Culmination, impact of campaign\n#Wars with the Ottoman Empire\n##1st war against the Ottomans\n###Developments\n##2nd war against the Ottomans\n###Beginning\n###The apex of military deeds\n#Cossack Rebellion (1774)\n##In the footsteps of Pugachev\n#Kuban and Crimea\n##Kuban\n##Crimea (Little Tartary)\n###Christian resettlement\n###Kherson\n###Tulchin\n#Finland (1791–1792)\n#Relations with Paul\n#Italian and Swiss expedition of 1799\n##Italian campaign\n###General coverage of events\n###Two resounding victories: Trebbia and Novi\n###Detailed assessment of all battles\n###Campaign environment\n##Swiss campaign\n###Defeat of the allied armies\n###Early achievements\n###Salvation and breakthrough\n###Consequences\n#On the road from Switzerland to Russia\n##Suvorov, Nelson, Coburg, and Charles\n##St. Petersburg\n#Military record\n#Progeny and titles\n##Honours\n##Progeny\n#Character\n#Assessment\n##Suvorov's art of war\n##Suvorov and Napoleon\n#Legacy\n##Miscellaneous art\n###Coins\n###Banknotes\n###Stamps\n##Ukraine\n#Literary references\n#See also\n#Notes and refs\n##Notes\n##References\n#Attribution\n#Further reading\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

President John F. Kennedy eventually quelled the riot by mobilizing more than 30,000 troops, the most for a single disturbance in United States history.\nIn the wake of the Supreme Court's 1954 decision Brown v. Board of Education, Meredith tried to integrate Ole Miss by applying in 1961. When he informed the university that he was African-American, his admission was delayed and obstructed, first by school officials and then by Mississippi Governor Ross Barnett. In a bid to block his enrollment, Barnett had Meredith temporarily jailed. Multiple attempts by Meredith, accompanied by federal officials, to enroll were physically blocked. Hoping to avoid violence and ensure Meredith's enrollment, President Kennedy and Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy had a series of unproductive telephone negotiations with Barnett.\nIn preparation for another registration attempt, federal law enforcement were dispatched to accompany Meredith to maintain order, but a riot erupted on campus. Partly incited by white supremacist and former General Edwin Walker, the mob assaulted reporters and federal officers, burned and looted property, and hijacked vehicles. Reporters, U.S. marshals, and the U.S. Deputy Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach sheltered in the Lyceum, the university's administrative building. Into the late morning of October 1, 160 marshals were injured including 28 marshals who received gunshot wounds while defending the Lyceum from an attacking mob using smoke grenades, tear gas, and bayonets. Two civilians were killed during the riot, Paul Guihard, a French journalist, and Ray Gunter, a jukebox repairman. Unaware of the riot, President Kennedy made an Oval Office address, saluting Mississippi's help in registering Meredith. Once informed, Kennedy invoked the Insurrection Act of 1807 and had U.S. Army units under Brigadier General Charles Billingslea quell the riot.\nThe riot and the federal crackdown were a major turning point in the civil rights movement and resulted in the desegregation of Ole Miss—the first integration of any public educational facility in Mississippi. The final time troops were deployed during the civil rights movement, it is regarded as the end of the segregationist tactic of massive resistance. A statue of James Meredith now commemorates the event on campus, and the site of the riot is designated as a National Historic Landmark.","content":"#Leadup\n##Meredith's attempts to enroll\n##Kennedy dialogue and escalating tensions\n#Events\n##Meredith arrives\n##Violence on campus\n##Military response\n##Aftermath\n#Legacy\n#Notes and references\n##Notes\n##Citations and references\n","lang":"en"}

It was formally approved as a national historic monument by the National Commission of Patrimony and Architecture on December 8, 2022.\nSacré-Cœur Basilica is located at the summit of the butte of Montmartre. From its dome two hundred meters above the Seine, the basilica overlooks the entire city of Paris and its suburbs. It is the second most popular tourist destination in the capital after the Eiffel Tower.\nThe basilica was first proposed by Felix Fournier, the Bishop of Nantes, in 1870 after the defeat of France and the capture of Napoleon III at the Battle of Sedan in the Franco-Prussian War. He attributed the defeat of France to the moral decline of the country since the French Revolution, and proposed a new Parisian church dedicated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus. The edifice was proposed before the outbreak  of the Paris Commune but since it was constructed at the highest point of the city, overlooking the site of the outbreak of the Commune, it has remained controversial with politicians of the French left, for whom it symbolizes the repression of the Communards and the reactionary politics of the Third French Republic (1870-1940).\nThe basilica was designed by Paul Abadie, whose Neo-Byzantine-Romanesque plan was selected from among seventy-seven proposals. Construction began in 1875 and continued for forty years under five different architects. Completed in 1914, the basilica was formally consecrated in 1919 after World War I.\nSacré-Cœur Basilica has maintained perpetual adoration of the Holy Eucharist since 1885. The site is traditionally associated with the martrydom of Saint Denis, the patron saint of Paris.","content":"#History\n##Proposal\n##Site\n##Construction\n##Controversy over the church\n#Description\n##Exterior\n##Interior\n###The Triumph of the Sacred Heart of Jesus mosaic\n###Chapels\n###Crypt\n##Art and decoration\n###Stained glass\n###Sculpture\n##Grand organ\n##Bells\n#Role in Catholicism\n#Access\n#Copy in Martinique\n#See also\n#References\n#Bibliography (in French)\n#Further reading\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

It is the sequel to F9 (2021), the tenth main installment, and the eleventh installment overall in the Fast & Furious franchise. It stars Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto alongside an ensemble cast including Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges, John Cena, Nathalie Emmanuel, Jordana Brewster, Sung Kang, Scott Eastwood, Daniela Melchior, Alan Ritchson, Helen Mirren, Brie Larson, Rita Moreno, Jason Statham, Jason Momoa, and Charlize Theron. In the film, Toretto must protect his family from Dante Reyes (Momoa), who seeks revenge for his father's death and the loss of his family's fortunes.\nDevelopment on a tenth main Fast & Furious film began by October 2020, with Lin returning to direct. The film's official title was revealed when principal photography began in April 2022. Lin left as director later that month, citing creative differences, though he retained writing and producing credits. Leterrier was then hired as his replacement a week later and performed several uncredited rewrites to the screenplay. Longtime franchise composer Brian Tyler returned to score the film. With an estimated production budget of $380  million, Fast X is the fourth-most expensive film ever made. Filming lasted until that August, taking place in London, Rome, Turin, other Italian cities, Lisbon, and Los Angeles.\nFast X premiered in Rome on May 12, 2023, and was released in the United States on May 19, by Universal Pictures.

The name \"Mawar\" means Rose in Malay. The second named storm, the first typhoon and the first super typhoon of the 2023 Pacific typhoon season, Mawar originated from an area of low pressure south-southwest of Chuuk Lagoon that developed into a tropical depression on May 19. It fluctuated in intensity and became a tropical storm, after which it intensified into a Category 4-equivalent super typhoon on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. It then underwent an eyewall replacement cycle, then reintensified to attain 1-minute sustained winds of 305 km\/h (190 mph)  according to the JTWC, becoming a Category 5-equivalent super typhoon. Mawar weakened slightly as it moved around the southwestern edge of the subtropical high that made it steer north of the Philippines and then east of Taiwan. Mawar traversed the Okinawa Islands as a tropical storm, then transitioned into an extratropical cyclone as it moved northeastward out to sea, where it later dissipated east of Kamchatka Peninsula.\nTyphoon Mawar passed north of Guam as a Category 4-equivalent typhoon on May 24, bringing hurricane-force winds and heavy rain marking as the strongest storm to affect the island since Typhoon Pongsona in 2002. U.S. President Joe Biden declared Guam a major disaster area on May 27, enabling the distribution of federal funds. Two men are presumed dead after going missing in the waters off Guam; additionally, one death related to the storm has been reported in Taiwan. Mawar caused one death, one minor injury, and damage worth ₱201,696 (US$3,584) as it passed close to the eastern Philippines. Heavy rain in parts of Japan killed two people and left four people missing. At least 8,900 homes experienced power outages in Japan. Total damages from Mawar are estimated to reach US$4.3 billion.","content":"#Meteorological history\n#Preparations\n##Mariana Islands\n##Elsewhere\n#Impact and aftermath\n##Guam\n##Northern Mariana Islands\n##Elsewhere\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Slavery_in_ancient_Rome","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Slavery_in_ancient_Rome","summary":"Slavery in ancient Rome played an important role in society and the economy. Unskilled or low-skill slaves labored in the fields, mines, and mills with few opportunities for advancement and little chance of freedom. Skilled and educated slaves—including artisans, chefs, domestic staff and personal attendants, entertainers, business managers, accountants and bankers, educators at all levels, secretaries and librarians, civil servants, and physicians—occupied a more privileged tier of servitude and could hope to obtain freedom through one of several well-defined paths with protections under the law. The possibility of manumission and subsequent citizenship was a distinguishing feature of Rome's system of slavery, resulting in a significant and influential number of freedpersons in Roman society.\nAt all levels of employment, free working people, former slaves, and the enslaved mostly did the same kinds of jobs. Elite Romans whose wealth came from property ownership saw little difference between slavery and a dependence on earning wages from labor. Slaves were themselves considered property under Roman law and had no rights of legal personhood. Unlike Roman citizens, by law they could be subjected to corporal punishment, sexual exploitation, torture, and summary execution. The most brutal forms of punishment were reserved for slaves. The adequacy of their diet, shelter, clothing, and healthcare was dependent on their perceived utility to owners whose impulses might be cruel or situationally humane.\nSome people were born into slavery as the child of an enslaved mother. Others became slaves. War captives were considered legally enslaved, and Roman military expansion during the Republican era was a major source of slaves. From the 2nd century BC through late antiquity, kidnapping and piracy put freeborn people all around the Mediterranean at risk of illegal enslavement, to which the children of poor families were especially vulnerable. Although a law was passed to ban debt slavery quite early in Rome's history, some people sold themselves into contractual slavery to escape poverty. The slave trade, lightly taxed and regulated, flourished in all reaches of the Roman Empire and across borders.\nIn antiquity, slavery was seen as the political consequence of one group dominating another, and people of any race, ethnicity, or place of origin might become slaves, including freeborn Romans. Slavery was practiced within all communities of the Roman Empire, including among Jews and Christians. Even modest households might expect to have two or three slaves.\nA period of slave rebellions ended with the defeat of Spartacus in 71 BC; slave uprisings grew rare in the Imperial era, when individual escape was a more persistent form of resistance. Fugitive slave-hunting was the most concerted form of policing in the Roman Empire.\nMoral discourse on slavery was concerned with the treatment of slaves, and abolitionist views were almost nonexistent. Inscriptions set up by slaves and freedpersons and the art and decoration of their houses offer glimpses of how they saw themselves. A few writers and philosophers of the Roman era were former slaves or the sons of freed slaves. Some scholars have made efforts to imagine more deeply the lived experiences of slaves in the Roman world through comparisons to the Atlantic slave trade, but no portrait of the \"typical\" Roman slave emerges from the wide range of work performed by slaves and freedmen and the complex distinctions among their social and legal statuses.","content":"#Origins\n##Enslavement of Roman citizens\n#The slave in Roman law and society\n##Marriage and family\n##Peculium\n##Manumission\n##Freedmen\n##Dediticii\n#Causes of enslavement\n##War captives\n###Captivi in Roman culture\n##Piracy and kidnapping\n##Vernae\n###Alumni\n##Child labor\n###Child abandonment\n###Infant exposure\n###Parental sale\n##Debt slavery\n##Self-sales\n#The slave economy\n##The slave trade\n###Auctions and sales\n###Slave-traders\n###Taxes and tariffs\n##Types of work\n###Household slaves\n###Urban crafts and services\n###Agriculture\n###Hard labor\n###Public and imperial slaves\n###Business managers and agents\n###Gladiators, entertainers, and prostitutes\n##Serfdom\n#Demography\n##Race and ethnicity\n#Quality of life\n##Healthcare\n###Physicians\n##Cicero and Tiro\n##Names\n##Clothing\n#Resistance and control\n##Rebellions\n###First Servile War (135–132 BC)\n###Second Servile War (104–100 BC)\n###Third Servile War (73–71 BC)\n###Later uprisings\n##Fugitive slave-catching\n###The fugitive in Roman culture\n##Punishments\n###Chaining\n###Tattooing and branding\n###Collaring\n###Crucifixion\n##Suicide\n#Slavery and Roman religion\n##Slaves in classical Roman religion\n###Saturnalia\n###The Festival of Handmaids\n##Temple slaves\n##Mithraic cult\n##Early Christian church\n#Commemoration\n#Slavery and Roman morality\n##Stoic philosophy\n##Epicurean philosophy\n##Early Christian attitudes toward slavery\n##Sexual ethics and attitudes\n#In Latin and Imperial Greek literature\n##Roman comedy\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n##Bibliography\n#Further reading\n","lang":"en"}

It is the only representative of the genus Rangifer. More recent studies suggest the splitting of reindeer and caribou into six distinct species over their range.\nReindeer occur in both migratory and sedentary populations, and their herd sizes vary greatly in different regions. The tundra subspecies are adapted for extreme cold, and some are adapted for long-distance migration.\nReindeer vary greatly in size and color from the smallest, the Svalbard reindeer (R. (t.) platyrhynchus), to the largest, Osborn's caribou (R. t. osborni). Although reindeer are quite numerous, some species and subspecies are in decline and considered vulnerable. They are unique among deer (Cervidae) in that females may have antlers, although the prevalence of antlered females varies by subspecies.\nReindeer are the only successfully semi-domesticated deer on a large scale in the world.

It was his record-extending 10th Australian Open title and 22nd major title overall, tying Rafael Nadal for the all-time record of most Grand Slam men's singles titles won. He also became the second man to win double-digit titles at a single major, after Nadal at the French Open. Djokovic lost just one set en route to the title (in the second round to Enzo Couacaud), and extended his match winning-streak at the Australian Open to an Open Era record 28 matches.\nNadal was the defending champion, but lost in the second round to Mackenzie McDonald. This was also his final professional appearance at the Australian Open.\nCarlos Alcaraz, Casper Ruud, Tsitsipas and Djokovic were in contention for the world No. 1 singles ranking at the beginning of the tournament. By winning the tournament, Djokovic claimed the top spot. Alcaraz, the incumbent world No. 1, withdrew from the tournament due to a right leg injury.\nAs it was in the previous major held a few months earlier, neither of the top two seeds advanced to the quarterfinals, with Nadal and Ruud both losing in the second round; this marked the first men's singles major since the 2002 Australian Open where the top two seeds lost prior to the third round. Tsitsipas became the youngest finalist since Djokovic in 2011.

{"title":"Meteorological_history_of_Cyclone_Freddy","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Meteorological_history_of_Cyclone_Freddy","summary":"Cyclone Freddy was the longest-lived tropical cyclone, lasting five weeks and three days, surpassing the previous record holder, 1994's Hurricane John. It also had the highest accumulated cyclone energy, a metric used to measure tropical cyclone activity, ever recorded worldwide. It also featured a record seven separate rounds of rapid intensification during February and March 2023. Freddy originated from a tropical low south of the Indonesian archipelago early on 4 February. Deep convection soon developed, and the system intensified Category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian scale on 6 February. Located just within Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre Melbourne's area of responsibility, the storm was named Freddy—the third named storm of the 2022–23 Australian region cyclone season—by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. As it moved westward across the Indian Ocean, Freddy quickly intensified and became a Category 4 severe tropical cyclone before it moved into the area of responsibility of Météo-France La Réunion. As the second very intense tropical cyclone of the 2022–23 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season. Freddy peaked with 10-minute sustained  winds of 230 km\/h (145 mph) and a central barometric pressure of 927 hPa (27.37 inHg). It quickly strengthened, reaching 1-minute sustained winds of 270 km\/h (165 mph), making it a Category 5-equivalent intensity on the Saffir–Simpson scale. \nAfter briefly weakening from its peak intensity, the cyclone moved toward the northern Mascarene Islands. It then developed a pinhole eye while approaching Madagascar as a compact tropical cyclone. The cyclone then made landfall as a strong Category 2-equivalent intensity with 1-minute sustained winds of 175 km\/h (110 mph) near Mananjary, Madagascar on 21 February.\nThis made Freddy the strongest storm to impact the island nation since Cyclone Batsirai a year earlier. It weakened further as it moved overland but regained strength upon reaching the Mozambique Channel. The cyclone intensified into a severe tropical storm and then passed north of Europa Island. The cyclone then made its second landfall near Vilankulos, Mozambique, as a moderate tropical storm status on 24 February. Upon re-entering the channel early on 1 March, it began regaining tropical characteristics and meandering along the Madagascar coast. It then intensified into a tropical cyclone with winds of about 175 km\/h (110 mph) before making its final landfall near Quelimane, Mozambique on 11 March. Thereafter, it gradually weakened and dissipated late on 14 March.","content":"#Formation and intensification\n#The Mascarene Islands, Madagascar, and Mozambique\n#Redevelopment and dissipation\n#Records\n#See also\n#Notes\n","lang":"en"}
{"title":"Scientology","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Scientology","summary":"Scientology is a set of beliefs and practices invented by the American author L. Ron Hubbard, and an associated movement. It is variously defined as a cult, a business, a religion, or a scam. Hubbard initially developed a set of ideas that he called Dianetics, which he represented as a form of therapy. An organization that he established in 1950 to promote it went bankrupt, and Hubbard lost the rights to his book Dianetics in 1952. He then recharacterized his ideas as a religion, likely for tax purposes, and renamed them Scientology. By 1954, he had regained the rights to Dianetics and founded the Church of Scientology, which remains the largest organization promoting Scientology. There are practitioners independent of the Church, in what is referred to as the Free Zone. Estimates put the number of Scientologists at under 40,000 worldwide.\nKey Scientology beliefs include reincarnation, and that traumatic events cause subconscious command-like recordings in the mind (termed \"engrams\") that can be removed only through an activity called \"auditing\". A fee is charged for each session of \"auditing\". Once an \"auditor\" deems an individual free of \"engrams\" they are given the status of \"clear\". Scholarship differs on the interpretation of these beliefs: some academics regard them as religious in nature; other scholars regard them as merely a means of extracting money from Scientology recruits. After attaining \"clear\" status, adherents can take part in the Operating Thetan levels, which require further payments. The Operating Thetan texts are kept secret from most followers; they are revealed only after adherents have typically given hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Scientology organization. Despite its efforts to maintain the secrecy of the texts, they are freely available on various websites, including at the media organization WikiLeaks. These texts say past lives took place in extraterrestrial cultures. They involve an alien called Xenu, described as a planetary ruler 70 million years ago who brought billions of aliens to Earth and killed them with thermonuclear weapons. Despite being kept secret from most followers, this forms the central mythological framework of Scientology's ostensible soteriology. These aspects have become the subject of popular ridicule.\nSince its formation, Scientology groups have generated considerable opposition and controversy. This includes deaths of practitioners while under Church of Scientology care, several instances of extensive criminal activities, and allegations by former adherents of exploitation and forced abortions. In the 1970s, Hubbard's followers engaged in a program of criminal infiltration of the U.S. government, resulting in several executives of the organization being convicted and imprisoned for multiple offenses by a U.S. federal court. Hubbard himself was convicted of fraud in absentia by a French court in 1978 and sentenced to four years in prison. In 1992, a court in Canada convicted the Scientology organization in Toronto of spying on law enforcement and government agencies and criminal breach of trust, later upheld by the Ontario Court of Appeal. The Church of Scientology was convicted of fraud by a French court in 2009, a judgment upheld by the supreme Court of Cassation in 2013.\nThe Church of Scientology has been described by government inquiries, international parliamentary bodies, scholars, law lords, and numerous superior court judgments as both a dangerous cult and a manipulative profit-making business. Numerous scholars and journalists have observed that profit is the primary motivating goal of the Scientology organization. Following extensive litigation in numerous countries, the organization has managed to attain a legal recognition as a religious institution in some jurisdictions, including Australia, Italy, and the United States. Germany classifies Scientology groups as an anti-constitutional sect, while the French government classifies the group as a dangerous cult.","content":"#Definition and classification\n##Debates over classification\n##Etymology\n#History\n#Beliefs and practices\n##Auditing\n##Soul\n##Space opera and the Wall of Fire\n##The Operating Thetan levels\n##Ethics\n##Symbology\n##Psychiatry, psychology, psychosis\n##Views on Hubbard\n#The Church of Scientology\n##Internal organization\n##Promotional material\n##Social outreach\n##Responses to opponents\n##Suppressive persons and fair game\n#Free Zone and independent Scientology\n#Controversies\n##Hubbard's motives\n##Criminal behavior\n##Organized harassment\n###Mistreatment of Members\n##Violation of auditing confidentiality\n##Allegations of coerced abortions\n##Allegation of human trafficking and other crimes against women\n##Scientology, litigation, and the Internet\n#Disputes over legal status\n#Scientology in religious studies\n##Influences\n#Demographics\n##Recruitment\n#Reception and influence\n##Media, popular culture, and academia\n#See also\n#References\n##Sources\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}
{"title":"Mișu_Benvenisti","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mișu_Benvenisti","summary":"Mișu Benvenisti, also known as Mishu or Moshe Benvenisti, sometimes Benveniste (Hebrew: מישו בנבנישתי; July 1, 1902 – 1977), was a Romanian-Israeli lawyer, Zionist militant, and leader of the Romanian Jewish community. Born into a family of printers and publishers, he was one of the few Sephardi Jews to reach prominence in political life during the Romanian Kingdom era. His association with Zionism began in his teenage years, and saw him emerging as leader of the Zionist Youth Organization (part of the HeHalutz, HH) in the early 1920s. Benvenisti was then primarily affiliated with the Renașterea Noastră group in Bucharest, joining the small Jewish National Party by 1930; through these, he participated in the formation of a nation-wide Jewish Party (PER), wherein he was youth organizer and general secretary. After 1936, he was also a member of the Romanian office of the World Jewish Congress (WJC), serving as its lawyer and as a rapporteur on the growth of local antisemitism.\nDuring the late 1930s, Romania drew closer to Nazi Germany and gradually introduced discrimination against Jews; the National Renaissance Front banned the PER, along with all other Romanian political parties, in early 1938. Zionists were allowed to form non-political bodies, which encouraged a wave of emigrations into Mandatory Palestine. As Nazi pressures increased with the arrival in power of Ion Antonescu, Benvenisti considered emigrating, but accepted appointment as chairman of the Zionist Executive. His political line there was one of moderation: he expressed loyalty toward Romania and increased control over the rebellious HH, intervening as a negotiator between the regime and the Jewish community. His stance was criticized by Jews on the right, including A. L. Zissu, as a form of collaborationism, especially due to his contacts with the submissive Central Jewish Office.\nFaced with the Holocaust occurring on Romania's borders, Benvenisti also cultivated the Jewish resistance—in particular by helping Hungarian, Slovak and Polish Jews find temporary shelter in Romania, or by assisting survivors of Antonescu's own deportations to Transnistria. Benvenisti and other Jewish leaders persuaded the Antonescu government to relax pressures on the Jews, though the Executive also had to agree to collect large sums as contributions and bribes. The Romanian Zionists' role in sabotaging the Holocaust was documented by the local Judenberater, Gustav Richter. As a result of his investigations, Romanian authorities reluctantly arrested Benvenisti in January 1944. He was released in March, by which time he had lost the confidence of his peers, being replaced at the head of the Executive by his rival Zissu. For the rest of 1944, Benvenisti presided upon his own splinter party, the Zionist Democratic Group Klal.\nAntonescu's downfall in August 1944 revived Romania's multi-party regime; consequently, Zissu and Benvenisti returned as factional leaders of the PER, with the former holding the party chairmanship. Benvenisti was moving toward the Jewish left, and embracing cooperation with the Romanian Communist Party and the Jewish Democratic Committee (CDE). In mid-1946, he replaced the anti-communist Zissu as president of both the WJC chapter and the PER, drawing the latter into an alliance with the CDE before the November elections. With the communists' turn to anti-Zionism, Benvenisti shut down the PER, criticized illegal emigration, and took political advice from CDE cadres such as Bercu Feldman. When the Romanian communist regime took over on the last days of 1947, he ended his Zionist involvement, though he and his wife Suzana still applied for emigration into Israel. Benvenisti was arrested in 1950 by the Securitate, tortured into confessing that he was a spy for Israel, and appeared at a show trial, alongside Zissu, in 1954. He was sentenced to life imprisonment, but ultimately freed and allowed to settle in Israel, which became his home for the final two decades of his life.","content":"#Biography\n##Early life and career\n##Fighting antisemitism\n##Against Richter\n##HeHalutz trial and marginalization\n##Communist turn\n##Zionist ban\n##Communist imprisonment and release\n#Notes\n#References\n","lang":"en"}

The Storm Prediction Center (SPC) issued a rare high risk for severe weather in two areas of the Mississippi Valley on March 31, the first high risk issuance since March 25, 2021. Approximately 28 million people were placed under tornado watches, including multiple PDS tornado watches, from the evening of March 31 through the overnight hours into the morning of April 1. This included the Little Rock, St. Louis, Chicago, and Memphis metropolitan areas, all of which were hit by multiple rounds of severe squall lines and supercell thunderstorms that produced damaging winds, large hail, and tornadoes. EF3 tornadoes in Arkansas, Tennessee, and Illinois prompted the issuance of tornado emergencies and multiple mass casualty incidents were declared for some of the hardest hit areas. One of these tornadoes was a high-end EF3 tornado that passed through the northern Little Rock metro, causing extensive damage and dozens of injuries. The strongest tornado was a low-end EF4 tornado that swept away homes on the west side of Keota, Iowa. Severe and tornadic weather also affected the Northeastern United States in the afternoon and evening of April 1, including a rare EF3 tornado that caused a death in Sussex County, Delaware. At certain points of the outbreak, over 20 simultaneous tornado warnings were active, with a total of 175 tornado warnings issued on March 31 with an additional 51 issued on April 1.\nIn all, 146 tornadoes touched down; 115 occurred on March 31 alone. The outbreak ranks third or fourth worldwide for producing the most tornadoes in a 24-hour period, with 136 tornadoes occurring between 19:00 UTC March 31 – 19:00 UTC April 1. That tally is surpassed only by the 1974 Super Outbreak with 148 in that 18-hour outbreak, the 2011 Super Outbreak with 219 in its busiest 24-hour period, and possibly Hurricane Milton with 160 warned tornadoes, but not all of these tornadoes are confirmed. The two super outbreaks were far more prolific in the number of significant tornadoes produced. This was also the most tornadoes in an outbreak since the 2011 Super Outbreak. Tornadoes killed 26 people during the outbreak, along with one indirect tornado-related fatality. Six other weather-related fatalities took place: five from straight-line winds and one indirect fatality during cleanup. Additionally, over 218 injuries also occurred during the outbreak. Later in the year, tornado expert Thomas P. Grazulis published the outbreak intensity score (OIS) as a way to rank outbreaks. The outbreak received 129 OIS points, ranking it as a historic tornado outbreak. NOAA meteorologist Andrew Lyons later stated that the outbreak stands alongside \"the days of April 27 and 1974.\"","content":"#Meteorological synopsis\n##March 31\n##April 1\n#Confirmed tornadoes\n##Little Rock–North Little Rock–Jacksonville, Arkansas\n##Keota–Wellman, Iowa\n##Wynne–Parkin–Turrell, Arkansas\/Drummonds–Burlison, Tennessee\n##Brighton–Covington–Brownsville, Tennessee\n##Ste.

{"title":"East_Palestine,_Ohio,_train_derailment","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/East_Palestine,_Ohio,_train_derailment","summary":"A freight train derailed in East Palestine, Ohio, United States on February 3, 2023, at 8:55 p.m. EST (UTC−5). The Norfolk Southern freight train was carrying hazardous materials when 38 cars derailed. Several railcars burned for more than two days and emergency crews also conducted controlled burns of several railcars, which released hydrogen chloride and phosgene into the air. As a result, residents within a 1-mile (1.6-kilometer) radius were evacuated. Agencies from Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Virginia assisted in the emergency response.\nFollowing the derailment, reaction and commentary focused on industry working conditions and safety concerns, including: the lack of modern brake safety regulations, the implementation of precision scheduled railroading (PSR), reduced railway workers per train, and increased train lengths and weight. Critics said train companies had failed to invest in  maintenance to prevent accidents, even though they conduct stock buybacks, in which capital that could be used on maintenance and safety measures is instead distributed to existing shareholders.\nSeveral unions and consumer organizations expressed concern about private ownership of railways and a \"profit-driven approach\", which they state puts workers and communities at high risk. The United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America (UE) also called for public ownership of the US railway systems.\nMajor US railroads promised to overhaul safety in the industry as a direct result of the East Palestine disaster. Although derailments rose at the top five freight railroads in 2023, Norfolk Southern was the only railroad among the five to report a decline in accidents in the period. A group of the railroads also promised to enroll in the Federal Railroad Administrations “close-call incident reporting system.” Only NS has joined the system.\nIn June 2024, the National Transportation Safety Board held a meeting in East Palestine to review its findings on the incident. The board voted unanimously to accept the findings and announced it would issue a report.\nBy October 2023, Norfolk Southern removed more than 167,000 tons of contaminated soil and more than 39 million gallons of tainted water from the derailment site.\nOne year after the incident, Norfolk Southern has committed more than $100 million to East Palestine, including $25 million for a regional safety training center and $25 million in planned improvements to East Palestine's park. The company has also paid $21 million directly to residents.","content":"#Background\n#Derailment\n#Emergency response and burn off\n##Burnoff unnecessary\n#Health and environmental concerns\n##Waste disposal\n##Independent testing\n##Whistleblower and cover-up allegations\n#Aftermath\n##Lawsuits and compensation\n##NTSB board meeting and findings\n##Federal Railroad Administration safety culture assessment\n#Inquiry and cause\n##Hearings\n##Brakes\n#Reactions\n##Congress\n##Misinformation\n##Comparisons\n#Subsequent derailments\n#See also\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Cornish_Bronze_Age","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cornish_Bronze_Age","summary":"The Cornish Bronze Age is an era of the prehistory of Cornwall that spanned the period from c. 2400 BCE to c. 800 BCE. It was preceded by the Cornish Neolithic, and followed by the Cornish Iron Age. It is characterized by the introduction and widespread use of copper and copper-alloy (bronze) weapons and tools.\nSignificant social and economic changes occurred in Cornwall over the course of the Bronze Age. The earliest stage coincided with the arrival of the Bell Beaker culture, the adoption of new ceramic styles, innovations in ritual and funerary customs, and the earliest evidence for exploitation of local tin and gold resources. Throughout the Early Bronze Age, the main focus was on ritual activity and the construction of ceremonial monuments in the uplands, with the few known domestic buildings being relatively fragile and temporary structures. This changed in the Middle Bronze Age, with a decline in monument construction, the expansion of livestock and arable farming, and a pronounced increase in the number of settlements, which by this stage consisted of much more substantial roundhouses. At the beginning of the Late Bronze Age, there was an apparent abandonment of upland settlements, a change in lowland roundhouse construction technique, and a change in pottery style, suggesting increasing influence from South-Central Britain.\nCornwall was part of an extensive trade and cultural network from at least the Early Bronze Age, exchanging goods and ideas with the communities along the Atlantic Façade, the Wessex culture, and to a lesser extent more distant societies in Central Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean. Trevisker Ware ceramics from Cornwall were transported to other parts of southern Britain, and the style was copied by potters in Ireland and Brittany. Cornwall was an important source for tin and gold in the Bronze Age, and is the most likely provenance for these metals in a substantial number of artefacts and semi-finished products found from this period in the rest of Britain, Ireland, Germany, and the Middle East.","content":"#Chronology\n#Overview\n##Summary\n###Bell Beaker period (c. 2400–1700 BCE)\n###Early Bronze Age (c. 2050–1500 BCE)\n###Middle Bronze Age (c. 1500–1100 BCE)\n###Late Bronze Age (c. 1100–800 BCE)\n#Settlements\n##Bodmin Moor\n##Cornish Killas\n##The Lizard\n##West Penwith\n##Scilly\n#Structures\n##Buildings\n##Field systems\n##Tor enclosures\n##Monuments\n###Barrows and cairns\n###Megaliths\n###Entrance graves\n###Ceremonial complexes\n#Subsistence\n#Ritual\n##Funerals\n##Grave goods\n##Ritual abandonment and destruction\n#Metal exploitation\n#Crafts\n##Lithics\n##Pottery\n##Metalwork\n##Other crafts\n#Amber, glass, and faience\n#Art\n#Trade and cultural networks\n#Social organization\n#Environment and ecology\n#Ethnicity, genetics, and language\n#See also\n#Citations\n","lang":"en"}
{"title":"Prelude_to_the_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Prelude_to_the_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine","summary":"In March and April 2021, prior to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Russian Armed Forces began massing thousands of personnel and military equipment near Russia's border with Ukraine and in Crimea, representing the largest mobilisation since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014. This precipitated an international crisis due to concerns over a potential invasion. Satellite imagery showed movements of armour, missiles, and heavy weaponry towards the border. The troops were partially withdrawn by June 2021, though the infrastructure was left in place. A second build-up began in October 2021, this time with more soldiers and with deployments on new fronts; by December over 100,000 Russian troops were massed around Ukraine on three sides, including Belarus from the north and Crimea from the south. Despite the Russian military build-ups, Russian officials from November 2021 to 20 February 2022 repeatedly denied that Russia had plans to invade Ukraine.\nThe crisis was related to the War in Donbas, itself part of the Russo-Ukrainian War, ongoing since February 2014. Intercepted phone conversations of Sergey Glazyev, a top advisor to Russian President Vladimir Putin, disclosed the specifics of the project Novorossiya to take over not just Crimea, but also the Donbas, Kharkiv, Odesa, and Zaporizhzhia regions of Ukraine, which Russia apparently aimed to annex following Crimea. The plan involved fomenting widespread unrest using pro-Russian agents on the ground, and then orchestrating uprisings that would announce rigged referendums about joining Russia, similar to the one that took place in Crimea on 16 March 2014. In December 2021, Russia advanced two draft treaties that contained requests for what it referred to as \"security guarantees\", including a legally binding promise that Ukraine would not join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and a reduction in NATO troops and materiel stationed in Eastern Europe, threatening unspecified military response if those demands were not met in full. NATO rejected these requests, and the United States warned Russia of \"swift and severe\" economic sanctions should it further invade Ukraine. The crisis was described by many commentators as one of the most intense in Europe since the Cold War.\nOn 21 February 2022, Russia officially recognised the two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine, the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic, as independent states, and deployed troops to Donbas, in a move interpreted as Russia's effective withdrawal from the Minsk Protocol. The breakaway republics were recognised in the boundaries of their respective Ukrainian oblasts, although much of this territory was still held by Ukrainian government forces. On 22 February, Putin declared the Minsk agreements as invalid and the Federation Council unanimously authorised him to use military force in the territories. On the morning of 24 February, Putin announced that Russia was initiating a \"special military operation\" in the Donbas, and launched a full-scale invasion into Ukraine.","content":"#Background\n#Initial tensions (March–April 2021)\n##First Russian military buildup\n##Continued violence and escalation\n##Partial withdrawal\n#Renewed tensions (October 2021–February 2022)\n##Second Russian military buildup\n###November 2021–December 2021\n###January 2022\n###February 2022\n##Alleged Russian subversion attempts\n###2022 Ukrainian coup d'état attempt\n##Russian accusations of genocide in eastern Ukraine\n##Ukrainian defences\n###Foreign support\n##Reinforcements deployed in NATO\n#Escalation and invasion (February 2022 – present)\n##Alleged clashes between Russia and Ukraine\n##Recognition of the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics\n###Putin's denial of Ukrainian statehood\n###International sanctions on Russia\n##Invasion\n#Diplomatic negotiations\n##NATO–Russia security talks\n##United Nations Security Council\n##International treaties and negotiation structures\n##Lavrov–EU correspondence\n#See also\n#Explanatory notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

PAOK are one of the top domestic clubs, the most widely supported in Northern Greece and the current Greek Super League champions.\nEstablished on 20 April 1926 by Greek refugees who fled to Thessaloniki from Constantinople in the wake of the Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922), they play their home games at Toumba Stadium, a 29,000 seating capacity football ground. Their name, along with the club's emblem, the Byzantine-style double-headed eagle with retracted wings, honours the memory of the people and places (mostly from the city of Constantinople) that once belonged to the Eastern Roman Empire. PAOK currently plays in the top-flight Super League, which they have won four times (in 1976, 1985, 2019 and 2024). They are eight-time winners of the Greek Cup (in 1972, 1974, 2001, 2003, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2021). The club is one of the three which have never been relegated from the top national division and the only team in Greece that have won the Double (in 2019) going unbeaten (26–4–0 record) in a national round-robin league tournament (league format since 1959).\nThe team has appeared several times in the UEFA Europa League, but has yet to reach the group stage of the UEFA Champions League. PAOK have reached the quarter-finals of a European competition three times; once in the 1973–74 European Cup Winners' Cup and twice in the UEFA Conference League, in the 2021–22 and 2023–24 seasons. PAOK is the only Greek team that has more wins than losses in their European record (90 wins, 65 draws and 79 defeats, as of April 2024) and the 0–7 away UEFA Cup win over Locomotive Tbilisi on 16 September 1999 is the largest ever achieved by a Greek football club in all European competitions.","content":"#History\n##Foundation and early years (1926–1939)\n##Greco-Italian War and World War II (1939–1945)\n##Macedonia Football Clubs Association (Macedonia Championship) (1946–1959)\n##Toumba Stadium and rise of Giorgos Koudas to prominence (1959–1969)\n###First years in Greek National League (Alpha Ethniki)\n###Giorgos Koudas debut and start of the Olympiacos–PAOK rivalry\n##1970s\n###1975–76 Alpha Ethniki (first league title)\n##1980s: Professionalism, league title and financial troubles\n###1984–85 Alpha Ethniki (second league title)\n##The Thomas Voulinos era (1989–1996)\n##The George Batatoudis era (1996–2003)\n##The Giannis Goumenos era: troubled times (2003–2006)\n##Theodoros Zagorakis – Zisis Vryzas management with massive fans' support (2007–2012)\n##The Ivan Savvidis era (2012–present)\n###2017–18 eventful season\n###2018–19 unbeaten Champions and first Domestic Double\n###2020–21 Greek Cup winners and 2021–22 UEFA Europa Conference League quarter-finalists\n###2023–24 Greek Championship and UEFA Conference League quarter-finalists\n#Crest and colours\n##Crest\n##Colours\n###Kit suppliers and shirt sponsors\n#Facilities\n##Toumba Stadium\n##New Toumba Stadium project\n##Training ground\n##New Training Center Thermi\n#Supporters\n##Vale of Tempe tragedy (1999)\n##Supporters friendships\n##Rivalries\n#Honours\n##Domestic\n##Continental\n##Regional\n##Other\n#European record\n##UEFA Club Ranking\n#Players\n##Current squad\n###Reserves and Academy\n##Out on loan\n##Captains (since 1959)\n##MVP of the Season\n#Management\n##Coaching staff\n##Notable managers\n##Club personnel\n##Chairmen history\n#Records and statistics\n##One-club men\n##Player records\n##Domestic records\n##Notable supporters\n#See also\n#Bibliography\n#Filmography\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}
{"title":"September_2022_United_Kingdom_mini-budget","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/September_2022_United_Kingdom_mini-budget","summary":"On 23 September 2022, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kwasi Kwarteng, delivered a Ministerial Statement entitled \"The Growth Plan\" to the House of Commons. Widely referred to in the media as a mini-budget (it not being an official budget statement), it contained a set of economic policies and tax cuts such as bringing forward the planned 1% cut in the basic rate of income tax to 19%; abolishing the highest (45%) rate of income tax in England, Wales and Northern Ireland; reversing a plan announced in March 2021 to increase corporation tax from 19% to 25% from April 2023; reversing the April 2022 increase in National Insurance; and cancelling the proposed Health and Social Care Levy. Following widespread negative response to the mini-budget, the planned abolition of the 45% tax rate was reversed 10 days later, while plans to cancel the increase in corporation tax were reversed 21 days later.\nThe mini-budget was among the first measures of the Truss ministry, which had begun on 6 September. The statement was delivered against the backdrop of a cost-of-living crisis and was immediately followed by a sharp fall in the value of the pound sterling against the US dollar as world markets reacted negatively to the increased borrowing required. They also appeared to be concerned that no independent forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) had been published. By the next day of trading, the pound had hit an all-time low against the US dollar. The mini-budget drew widespread criticism from economists, some of whom feared that its reliance on increased government borrowing to pay for the largest tax cuts in 50 years could lead to a situation similar to the 1976 sterling crisis when the UK was forced to ask the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a financial bailout. The IMF took the unusual step of issuing an openly critical response to the budget, saying it would \"likely increase inequality\". It urged the UK government to \"re-evaluate\" the proposed tax cuts. HM Treasury announced plans to outline in November how the proposals would be costed, this being later brought forward to 31 October, alongside an independent forecast from the OBR.\nDespite continued market turbulence, and calls from Members of Parliament including members of the Conservative Party for a policy reversal, Prime Minister Liz Truss and Kwarteng maintained that the proposals outlined in the mini-budget would go ahead. Speculation began to mount about Truss's future as prime minister, and on 14 October she summoned Kwarteng back to the UK from a meeting of finance ministers in Washington, D.C., and asked for his resignation. Truss then appointed Jeremy Hunt to replace him. Hunt subsequently reversed the majority of the tax cuts that had been outlined in the mini-budget, a decision that led to a positive market reaction. Following Truss's resignation on 25 October, her successor Rishi Sunak retained Hunt as Chancellor. The 31 October statement was moved to 17 November in order to base it on the \"most accurate possible\" economic forecasts, and was also upgraded to a full autumn statement.\nInitial reaction to the mini-budget was mixed. The Daily Mail called it a \"true Tory budget\", while Frances O'Grady, the General Secretary of the Trades Union Congress, branded it \"Robin Hood in reverse\". Faisal Islam, the BBC's economics editor, described the mini-budget's reversal as \"the biggest U-turn in British economic history\". William Keegan, the former economics editor of The Observer, wrote that the plans outlined in the statement had shown a misunderstanding of Thatcherism and its attitude towards taxation.","content":"#Background\n#The budget\n##Key points\n#Reaction\n##Currency, interest rate, and debt\n##Bond markets\n##International response\n##Business and economic\n##Media\n##Political\n##Opinion polling\n#Government response\n##Initial responses\n##Dismissal of Chancellor\n##Reversal of tax cuts\n#Resignation of Truss as Prime Minister\n#Subsequent events\n##Following Truss's resignation\n##Later events\n#See also\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"2022_Pakistani_airstrikes_in_Afghanistan","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2022_Pakistani_airstrikes_in_Afghanistan","summary":"On 16 April 2022, the Pakistani military conducted predawn airstrikes on multiple targets in Afghanistan's Khost and Kunar provinces. Afghan officials said the attacks killed at least 47 civilians and injured 23 others.  Initial reports described the attacks as either rocket strikes or aerial strikes carried out by a number of aircraft of the Pakistan Air Force, and Afghan officials claimed the operation was carried out by Pakistani military helicopters and jets. Pakistani officials initially denied Pakistan carried out the airstrikes, but Pakistani security officials later claimed the airstrikes involved drone strikes from inside Pakistani airspace, and that no aircraft were deployed. Some reports said the Pakistani airstrikes also targeted parts of Paktika Province. \nThe Taliban administration in Kabul did not release casualty figures, but acknowledged civilian deaths and diplomatically protested the incident. The airstrikes appeared to have been carried out as retaliation to an attack on a Pakistani military convoy in North Waziristan, Pakistan on 14 April, which had killed seven Pakistani soldiers. According to the Pakistani media and some Afghan media outlets, the attacks targeted militants belonging to Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). Pakistani soldiers had also reportedly clashed with Taliban forces around 9 p.m. on 15 April in Gurbuz District, Khost Province, killing two Taliban fighters.\nProtests against the attacks took place in several Afghan provinces including one in Nimruz Province, that turned violent when the Pakistani border forces allegedly opened fire and injured six protesters. In Bannu, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan, a sit-in started after the airstrikes. The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) expressed concern over the civilian casualties in the airstrikes, and said it was working to establish the facts and verify losses.","content":"#Background\n#Casualties\n#Reactions\n##Afghan government\n##Pakistani government\n##Pakistani Taliban\n##United States government\n##Chinese government\n##United Nations\n#Protests\n#Compensation\n#See also\n","lang":"en"}

{"title":"Tornado_outbreak_of_January_12,_2023","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tornado_outbreak_of_January_12,_2023","summary":"An early-season tornado outbreak impacted the Southeastern United States on January 12, 2023. The result of a mid-level trough moving through, moisture and the presence of a strong low-level jet aided in the development of numerous severe and tornadic thunderstorms. Early in the outbreak, a strong EF2 tornado caused considerable damage in Winston County, Alabama, while another EF2 tornado struck just south of Greensboro. A destructive high-end EF2 tornado struck Selma, causing widespread damage and two injuries. The same storm produced a long-lived EF3 tornado that moved through or near Old Kingston, Titus, Equality, and Lake Martin, resulting in seven fatalities and several injuries in Autauga County alone. Another EF2 tornado from the storm struck areas in or around Five Points and Standing Rock before crossing into Georgia. After the dissipation of that tornado, nine more tornadoes, five of which were strong, caused heavy damage across west-central Georgia, especially in LaGrange, Griffin, and Experiment, the second one of which was impacted by four tornadoes in the span of 10 minutes, including two that were rated EF2 and EF3 respectively. Another EF2 tornado from the storm caused major damage and another fatality in the Jackson Lake area as well; an indirect death from the tornado also occurred the following day. Elsewhere, other tornadoes caused damage in Sumter and Mobile counties in Alabama, as well as parts of Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, and the Carolinas. In all, 43 tornadoes were confirmed.","content":"#Meteorological synopsis\n#Confirmed tornadoes\n##January 12 event\n##Selma, Alabama\n##Old Kingston–Titus–Equality–Lake Martin–Penton, Alabama\n##Hollonville–Griffin–Experiment–Locust Grove, Georgia\n##East Griffin–Jenkinsburg–Jackson Lake, Georgia\n#Impacts\n##Casualties\n##Closures\n##Power outages\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

The match took place in Astana, Kazakhstan, from 9 April to 30 April 2023, and was a best of 14 games, plus tiebreaks.\nThe previous champion Magnus Carlsen decided not to defend his title against Ian Nepomniachtchi, the winner of the Candidates Tournament 2022, stating he was \"not motivated to play another match\". As a result, Nepomniachtchi played against Ding Liren, who finished second in the Candidates Tournament.\nAfter a 7–7 score tie in the classical time format — in which five of the first seven games were decisive — on 30 April, the match proceeded to tiebreaks with rapid time format. After draws in the first three games, Ding won with black in the final game to become the 17th World Chess Champion. Ding also became the first Chinese chess player to hold the title and, jointly with the 2020 women's world chess champion Ju Wenjun, made China the holder of both the open and women's world titles.\nDing gained a place in the Candidates only because Sergey Karjakin, whom he replaced, was sanctioned for supporting the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Ding had been unable to play throughout much of the COVID-19 pandemic, however, and had to play a number of hastily arranged matches to reach the minimum FIDE activity requirements to secure his place in the tournament. Nepomniachtchi won the Candidates, but Ding secured second place by beating Hikaru Nakamura in a must-win final-round game. Carlsen then relinquished his title, allowing Ding to play for the title despite not winning the Candidates. Nepomniachtchi took the lead three times during the match, but Ding evened the score each time, forcing a tiebreak. After three draws in the rapid tiebreaks, Ding won the fourth game to take the championship. Ding's path to winning the title was called \"most improbable\" by The Guardian.","content":"#Carlsen refuses to defend the title\n##History of non-participation\n#Candidates Tournament 2022\n##Results\n#Championship match\n##Organization\n##Match regulations\n##Previous head-to-head record\n##Seconds\n##Schedule\n##Leak of Ding Liren's preparation\n#Results\n##Classical games\n###Game 1: Nepomniachtchi–Ding, ½–½\n###Game 2: Ding–Nepomniachtchi, 0–1\n###Game 3: Nepomniachtchi–Ding, ½–½\n###Game 4: Ding–Nepomniachtchi, 1–0\n###Game 5: Nepomniachtchi–Ding, 1–0\n###Game 6: Ding–Nepomniachtchi, 1–0\n###Game 7: Nepomniachtchi–Ding, 1–0\n###Game 8: Ding–Nepomniachtchi, ½–½\n###Game 9: Nepomniachtchi–Ding, ½–½\n###Game 10: Ding–Nepomniachtchi, ½–½\n###Game 11: Nepomniachtchi–Ding, ½–½\n###Game 12: Ding–Nepomniachtchi, 1–0\n###Game 13: Nepomniachtchi–Ding, ½–½\n###Game 14: Ding–Nepomniachtchi, ½–½\n##Tie-break games\n###Game 15: Ding–Nepomniachtchi, ½–½\n###Game 16: Nepomniachtchi–Ding, ½–½\n###Game 17: Ding–Nepomniachtchi, ½–½\n###Game 18: Nepomniachtchi–Ding, 0–1\n#Reactions\n#Aftermath\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

It is her first new body of work since leaving RCA Records after her seventh studio album Plastic Hearts (2020) and signing with Columbia in early 2021. A pop and dance-pop record, Endless Summer Vacation is a shift from the synth-pop, rock, and glam rock genres featured on Plastic Hearts. Cyrus related its overall concept to her affection for Los Angeles, where the album was mainly recorded, and its track sequencing to the course of a day. Brandi Carlile and Sia are featured as guest vocalists.\nThe album was supported by three singles. The lead single, \"Flowers\", set several streaming and chart records and spent eight weeks atop the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, marking Cyrus' second number-one in the country, and topped the charts in 36 other countries. The second and third singles \"River\" and \"Jaded\" followed in March and April, respectively. A digital edition of the album featuring the fourth single, \"Used to Be Young\", was released in August.

Only players in these squads were eligible to take part in the tournament.\nA provisional release list of between 35 and 55 players per national team was submitted to FIFA by 21 October 2022, one month prior to the opening match of the tournament. The release lists were not made public by FIFA. From the preliminary squad, the final list of at most 26 and at least 23 players per national team were submitted to FIFA by 14 November, 19:00 AST (UTC+3), six days prior to the opening match of the tournament. FIFA published the final lists with squad numbers on their website on 15 November. The final matchday at club level for players named in the final squads was 13 November 2022, while clubs had to release their players by the following day. In the event that a player on the submitted squad list suffered from an injury or illness prior to his team's first match of the tournament, that player could be replaced at any time up to 24 hours before their first match. The team doctor and the FIFA General Medical Officer had to both confirm that the injury or illness was severe enough to prevent the player from participating in the tournament. Replacement players did not need to be limited to the preliminary list.\nOn 23 June 2022, the Bureau of the FIFA Council approved the increase of the maximum number of players included on the release list (from 35 to 55) and final list (from 23 to 26). This was due to the timing of the tournament in the football calendar and the disruptive effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe position listed for each player is per the official squad list published by FIFA. The age listed for each player is as of 20 November 2022, the first day of the tournament. The numbers of caps and goals listed for each player do not include any matches played after the start of the tournament.

{"title":"Historiography_of_the_Christianization_of_the_Roman_Empire","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Historiography_of_the_Christianization_of_the_Roman_Empire","summary":"The growth of Christianity from its obscure origin c. 40 AD, with fewer than 1,000 followers, to being the majority religion of the entire Roman Empire by AD 400, has been examined through a wide variety of historiographical approaches. \nUntil the last decades of the 20th century, the primary theory was provided by Edward Gibbon in The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, published in 1776. Gibbon theorized that paganism declined from the second century BC and was finally eliminated by the top-down imposition of Christianity by Constantine, the first Christian emperor, and his successors in the fourth century AD.\n\n \nFor over 200 years, Gibbon's model and its expanded explanatory versions—the conflict model and the legislative model—have provided the major narrative. The conflict model asserts that Christianity rose in conflict with paganism, defeating it only after emperors became Christian and were willing to use their power to require conversion through coercion. The legislative model is based on the Theodosian Code published in AD 438.\nIn the last decade of the 20th century and into the 21st century, multiple new discoveries of texts and documents, along with new research (such as modern archaeology and numismatics), combined with new fields of study (such as sociology and anthropology) and modern mathematical modeling, have undermined much of this traditional view. According to modern theories, Christianity became established in the third century, before Constantine, paganism did not end in the fourth century, and imperial legislation had only limited effect before the era of the Eastern emperor Justinian I (reign 527 to 565). In the twenty-first century, the conflict model has become marginalized, while a grassroots theory has developed. \nAlternative theories involve psychology or evolution of cultural selection, with many 21st-century scholars asserting that sociological models such as network theory and diffusion of innovation provide the most insight into the societal change. Sociology has also generated the theory that Christianity spread as a grass roots movement that grew from the bottom up; it includes ideas and practices such as charity, egalitarianism, accessibility and a clear message, demonstrating its appeal to people over the alternatives available to most in the Roman Empire of the time. The effects of this religious change are seen as mixed and are debated.","content":"#History\n##Of historiography\n##Roman religion\n###Context and other evidence\n##Spread of Christianity\n###Origin\n###Reception and growth in Roman society\n###Under Constantine and his Christian successors\n###Theodosius I\n####Theodosius II and Pope Leo I\n###Sixth to eighth centuries\n#Mathematical modelling\n#Possible reasons for a top-down spread\n##Traditional conflict models\n##Violence and temple destruction\n##Socio-economic factors\n##Influence of legislation\n#Possible reasons for a grassroots spread\n##New ideas\n###Inclusivity and exclusivity\n###Kerygma (central message)\n##Social practices\n###Women\n###Sexual morality\n###Care for the poor\n###Health care\n###Community\n###Martyrdom\n###Miracles\n#Alternative approaches\n##Network theory\n##Psychology\n##Evolution\n##Diffusion of innovation\n#Effects\n##Judicial penalties and clemency\n##Slavery\n##Persecution of heretics\n##Corruption\n##Gladiator games\n##Intolerance\n##Difference in sexual morality\n##Sanctity of life\n##Education\n##Sociological effects\n##Law\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Bibliography\n","lang":"en"}

One long-track, low-end EF4 tornado caused major damage near the towns of Winterset and Norwalk, resulting in six fatalities. Multiple other supercells spawned along an area of moderate destabilization in northern Missouri, prompting further tornado warnings in southern Iowa, as they entered a highly favorable environment for maturing. Large hail and damaging wind gusts accompanied the storms, which continued their passage across the Midwestern states into overnight. More tornadic weather was confirmed in Arkansas and Missouri the next day and into the early morning of March 7.

Plotinus is regarded by modern scholarship as the founder of Neoplatonism. His teacher was the self-taught philosopher Ammonius Saccas, who belonged to the Platonic tradition. Historians of the 19th century invented the term \"neoplatonism\" and applied it to refer to Plotinus and his philosophy, which was vastly influential during late antiquity, the Middle Ages, and the Renaissance. Much of the biographical information about Plotinus comes from Porphyry's preface to his edition of Plotinus' most notable literary work, The Enneads. In his metaphysical writings, Plotinus described three fundamental principles: the One, the Intellect, and the Soul. His works have inspired centuries of pagan, Jewish, Christian, Gnostic, and early Islamic metaphysicians and mystics, including developing precepts that influence mainstream theological concepts within religions, such as his work on duality of the One in two metaphysical states.","content":"#Biography\n##Expedition to Persia and return to Rome\n##Later life\n#Major ideas\n##The One\n##Emanation by the One\n##The true human and happiness\n##Henosis\n#Relation with contemporary philosophy and religion\n##Plotinus's Relation to Plato\n##Plotinus and the Gnostics\n##Against causal astrology\n#Film studies\n#Influence\n##Ancient world\n##Christianity\n##Islam\n##Judaism\n##Renaissance\n##Great Britain\n##India\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n","lang":"en"}

The offensive began on 18 April 2022 between the armed forces of Russia and Ukraine for control of the Donbas region. Military analysts consider the campaign to have been the second strategic phase of the invasion, after Russia's initial three-pronged attack into Ukraine.\nRussia's strategy in the sector was to encircle Ukrainian troops in the Donbas and to annex the entire Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts to the Russian-backed separatist states of the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) and Luhansk People's Republic (LPR). Russia claimed to have controlled 55% of Donetsk Oblast by 23 June 2022 and all of Luhansk Oblast by 3 July 2022, with Russian and separatist forces controlling the cities of Mariupol, Sievierodonetsk, Lysychansk, Rubizhne, and many others.\nThe Russian offensive stalled in September 2022 and some of the gains were reversed after Ukraine launched its Kharkiv offensive, with Ukrainian forces recapturing the cities of Lyman and Sviatohirsk in the Donetsk region and Bilohorivka in Luhansk oblast. The Ukrainian counteroffensive also stalled east of the Oskil river, and by November 2022 Russian assaults renewed in Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts.","content":"#Background\n##War in Donbas\n##Prior operations\n#Prelude\n##Russian objectives\n#Opposing forces and foreign involvement\n##Russian and pro-Russian forces\n##Ukrainian forces\n###Foreign support for Ukraine\n#Battle\n##Early operations (April–May 2022)\n###Popasna\n###Donetsk Oblast\n###Luhansk Oblast\n###Izium–Sloviansk front\n##Capture of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk, attempted advance on Sloviansk (May–July 2022)\n###Capture of Lyman and Sviatohirsk\n###Izium–Sloviansk front\n###Popasna–Bakhmut front\n###Sievierodonetsk front\n###Fall of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk\n##Russian operational pause (4–16 July 2022)\n#Renewed assaults in Donetsk Oblast (17 July–6 September 2022)\n##Russian assaults near Bakhmut, Soledar, and Siversk\n##Russian assaults near Avdiivka, Pisky, and Marinka\n##Russian assaults near Sloviansk, Ukrainian counteroffensive\n#Aftermath\n#Casualties\n##Military casualties\n##Civilian casualties\n#See also\n","lang":"en"}
