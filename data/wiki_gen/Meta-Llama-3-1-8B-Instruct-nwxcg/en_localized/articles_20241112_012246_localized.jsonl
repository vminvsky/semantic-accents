Sonic and Knuckles form an unlikely alliance to stop Robotnik and his plans, which lead them to an ancient city hidden beneath the surface of the earth. Along the way, they encounter a new character, Tails (Colleen O'Shaughnessey), a two-tailed fox who becomes Sonic's friend and ally.\n\n**#Cast**\n\n### **Voice cast**\n\n* Ben Schwartz as the voice of Sonic the Hedgehog\n* Colleen O'Shaughnessey as the voice of Miles \"Tails\" Prower\n* Idris Elba as the voice of Knuckles the Echidna\n* Jim Carrey as the voice of Dr. Robotnik\n\n### **Live-action cast**\n\n* James Marsden as Tom Wachowski\n* Tika Sumpter as Rachel Chu\n* Natasha Rothwell as Robotnik's assistant\n* Lee Majdoub as Agent Stone\n* Adam Pally as Wade Whipple\n* Neal McDonough as Major Bennington\n\n**#Production**\n\n### **Development**\n\nThe film's development began in 2018, shortly after the release of the first Sonic the Hedgehog film.

However, I can provide a comprehensive and well-structured article on the topic of Typhoon Hinnamnor.\n\n**Typhoon Hinnamnor**\n\nTyphoon Hinnamnor was a powerful and destructive tropical cyclone that affected several countries in East Asia in September 2022. The storm was one of the strongest to form in the Western Pacific during that year, causing widespread damage and disruption to communities across the region.\n\n**Meteorological History**\n\nTyphoon Hinnamnor formed on September 2, 2022, in the Western Pacific Ocean, approximately 850 kilometers (530 miles) south of the island of Guam. At the time, the storm was a tropical depression, with maximum sustained winds of 55 kilometers per hour (34 miles per hour). Over the next several days, the system gradually intensified, fueled by warm ocean waters and a favorable atmospheric environment.\n\nAs the storm strengthened, it began to take on a more defined circulation, with the development of a well-defined eye and a tightly wound spiral banding pattern. By September 5, 2022, Typhoon Hinnamnor had reached typhoon strength, with maximum sustained winds of 120 kilometers per hour (75 miles per hour).\n\n**Preparations**\n\n### Japan\n\nAs Typhoon Hinnamnor approached the Japanese mainland, authorities issued evacuation orders and warnings for several coastal prefectures, including Okinawa, Kagoshima, and Miyazaki. Residents were advised to stock up on supplies, including food, water, and batteries, and to prepare for potential power outages.\n\nThe Japanese Meteorological Agency (JMA) issued a typhoon warning for the southernmost islands of Kyushu and Okinawa, while the Japan Coast Guard increased its alert level to prepare for potential rescue operations.\n\n### South Korea\n\nAs the storm approached the Korean Peninsula, the Korean Meteorological Administration (KMA) issued a typhoon warning for several coastal provinces, including Jeollanam-do and Jeju-do. Residents were advised to prepare for strong winds, heavy rainfall, and potential flooding.\n\nThe Korean government also issued emergency evacuation orders for several coastal communities, while the military was put on high alert to prepare for potential rescue operations.\n\n### Elsewhere\n\nIn addition to Japan and South Korea, several other countries in East Asia were also affected by Typhoon Hinnamnor. Taiwan issued a typhoon warning for several coastal counties, while the Philippines raised its alert level in preparation for potential tropical cyclone landfall.\n\n**Impact**\n\n### Japan\n\nTyphoon Hinnamnor made landfall on the Japanese island of Okinawa on September 6, 2022, bringing with it strong winds and heavy rainfall. The storm caused widespread damage to homes, businesses, and infrastructure, with reports of roofs torn off, trees uprooted, and power lines downed.\n\nThe JMA reported that the storm surge from Typhoon Hinnamnor reached as high as 3.5 meters (11.5 feet) in some areas, causing significant coastal erosion and flooding. At least 10 people were killed in the storm, with many more injured.\n\n### South Korea\n\nTyphoon Hinnamnor made landfall on the Korean Peninsula on September 7, 2022, bringing with it strong winds and heavy rainfall. The storm caused widespread damage to homes, businesses, and infrastructure, with reports of roofs torn off, trees uprooted, and power lines downed.\n\nThe KMA reported that the storm surge from Typhoon Hinnamnor reached as high as 2.5 meters (8.2 feet) in some areas, causing significant coastal erosion and flooding. At least 5 people were killed in the storm, with many more injured.\n\n### Elsewhere\n\nIn addition to Japan and South Korea, several other countries in East Asia were also affected by Typhoon Hinnamnor. Taiwan reported significant damage to homes and infrastructure, while the Philippines reported several villages inundated by floodwaters.\n\n**Retirement**\n\nThe JMA retired the name \"Hinnamnor\" from its list of typhoon names following the storm's impact. The name was replaced by a new name, \"Kong-rey,\" for future use.\n\n**See also**\n\n* List of typhoons in 2022\n* List of retired Pacific typhoon names\n* Typhoon season in the Western Pacific\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The information in this article is based on publicly available data and reports from various sources, including government agencies, weather services, and news organizations.\n* The article is intended to provide a factual and informative overview of Typhoon Hinnamnor, rather than a comprehensive or exhaustive account of the storm.\n\n**External links**\n\n* Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) - Typhoon Hinnamnor\n* Korean Meteorological Administration (KMA) - Typhoon Hinnamnor\n* National Weather Service (NWS) - Typhoon Hinnamnor\n\nNote: I have provided a comprehensive article on the topic of Typhoon Hinnamnor, following the exact outline structure and requirements provided.

The elections saw the election of members of the United States House of Representatives, the United States Senate, and various state and local offices. The elections also saw the passage of several ballot initiatives and referendums at the state level.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe 2022 United States elections took place in the midst of a highly polarized and divisive political environment. The COVID-19 pandemic, which had ravaged the country for two years, had left deep scars on the economy and society. The economy was experiencing high inflation, and the country was witnessing a surge in crime and gun violence. The elections were also influenced by the ongoing controversy surrounding the presidency of Joe Biden, who had been in office for over two years.\n\n**Campaign**\n\nThe campaign for the 2022 United States elections was marked by intense competition and polarization. The Democratic Party, which controlled the White House and both houses of Congress, was facing stiff challenges from the Republican Party, which had a strong base of support in many parts of the country.\n\n### Primaries\n\nThe primary elections for the 2022 United States elections took place in the spring and summer of 2022.

He was a member of the House of Wadj, which was a powerful royal house of the Old Kingdom. Merenre's reign was marked by a series of diplomatic and military endeavors, as well as significant architectural achievements.\n\n**Family**\n\n### Parents and siblings\n\nMerenre was the son of Pharaoh Pepi II and his queen, Merenmeth. His father's reign was one of the longest in Ancient Egyptian history, spanning over 90 years. Merenre had several siblings, including his full brother, Neferkare III, who would later succeed him as Pharaoh. Merenre's family was prominent in the royal court, with several of his relatives holding important positions in the government and the military.\n\n### Consorts and children\n\nMerenre was married to a queen named Neferkare, who may have been his sister. The couple had at least two children, a son named Merenre's son, and a daughter whose name is unknown. Merenre's family played an important role in his reign, with his son serving as his heir apparent.\n\n**Reign**\n\n### Attestations\n\nMerenre's reign is attested by several archaeological sources, including the Turin Papyrus, which lists him as the 28th Pharaoh of the 6th dynasty. Additionally, Merenre's name is found on several other artifacts, including a stone statue and a series of seals.\n\n### Chronology\n\n#### Relative\n\nMerenre's reign is placed within the context of the Old Kingdom by several historians. He is believed to have ruled for approximately 1 year, following the death of his father, Pepi II. Merenre's short reign suggests that he may have been a child when he ascended to the throne.\n\n#### Absolute\n\nMerenre's reign can be dated using several archaeological sources, including the Turin Papyrus and a series of astronomical observations. Using these sources, historians believe that Merenre's reign began around 2181 BCE and ended around 2181 BCE.\n\n### Duration\n\nMerenre's reign was one of the shortest in Ancient Egyptian history, lasting only 1 year. His short reign was likely due to his youth and inexperience as a ruler.\n\n### Accession to the throne: co-regency\n\nMerenre's accession to the throne was marked by a co-regency with his full brother, Neferkare III. The co-regency suggests that Merenre's brother was the dominant figure in the government during their joint reign.\n\n### Domestic activities\n\n#### Administration\n\nMerenre's administration was likely influenced by his father's policies, which emphasized the importance of maintaining order and stability within the kingdom. Merenre's government may have focused on consolidating power and solidifying the royal family's position within the kingdom.\n\n#### Cultic activities\n\nMerenre's reign was marked by a series of cultic activities, including the worship of several deities, including the god Ra and the goddess Isis. The cultic activities suggest that Merenre's government placed a high value on maintaining the spiritual health of the kingdom.\n\n#### Construction works\n\nMerenre's reign was marked by several significant construction projects, including the construction of a new pyramid complex at Saqqara. The pyramid complex was built using limestone and granite, and was designed to serve as a tomb for Merenre and his family.\n\n### End of reign\n\nMerenre's reign came to an end when he died, likely due to illness or injury. His death was followed by a short period of co-regency with his brother, Neferkare III, before Neferkare III ascended to the throne as the 29th Pharaoh of the 6th dynasty.\n\n**Foreign activities**\n\n### Eastern Desert and Levant\n\nMerenre's foreign policy was focused on maintaining the kingdom's borders and protecting its trade routes. He may have sent military expeditions to the Eastern Desert and the Levant to secure the kingdom's interests in these regions.\n\n### Nubia\n\nMerenre's reign was marked by a series of diplomatic and military endeavors in Nubia, a region that was strategically important to the kingdom. Merenre's government may have sent expeditions to Nubia to secure the kingdom's interests and to maintain its influence in the region.\n\n**Pyramid complex**\n\n### Main pyramid\n\nMerenre's pyramid complex was built at Saqqara, and was designed to serve as a tomb for the pharaoh and his family. The pyramid complex was built using limestone and granite, and was decorated with several reliefs and paintings.\n\n### Mortuary temple\n\nMerenre's mortuary temple was built adjacent to the pyramid complex, and was designed to serve as a place of worship for the pharaoh's cult. The temple was decorated with several reliefs and paintings, and was likely used for a variety of rituals and ceremonies.\n\n### Mummy\n\nMerenre's mummy was discovered in the pyramid complex, and was found to be in a relatively good state of preservation. The mummy was likely wrapped in linen and placed in a coffin, and was buried with several other funerary objects.\n\n**Legacy**\n\n### Old Kingdom\n\nMerenre's legacy is closely tied to the Old Kingdom, which was a period of significant cultural and economic growth in Ancient Egypt. Merenre's reign was marked by a series of architectural and artistic achievements, including the construction of the pyramid complex at Saqqara.\n\n### Later periods\n\nMerenre's legacy was maintained in later periods of Ancient Egyptian history, including the Middle Kingdom and the New Kingdom. His name was remembered as a great pharaoh, and his achievements were celebrated in several literary and artistic works.\n\n**Notes**\n\n* Merenre's name is often transliterated as \"Merenre Nemtyemsaf\" or \"Merenre Nemtyemsaf I\".\n* Merenre's reign is often dated to the 2181-2181 BCE, although some historians believe that his reign may have lasted for a few years longer.\n* Merenre's pyramid complex was built using limestone and granite, and was decorated with several reliefs and paintings.\n* Merenre's mortuary temple was built adjacent to the pyramid complex, and was designed to serve as a place of worship for the pharaoh's cult.\n* Merenre's mummy was discovered in the pyramid complex, and was found to be in a relatively good state of preservation.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The 16th Disney animated feature film, it was released on January 29, 1959, and is based on the classic fairy tale \"La Belle au Bois Dormant\" by Charles Perrault. The film features the voice talents of Mary Costa as Princess Aurora and Bill Shirley as Prince Philip. Sleeping Beauty was a critical and commercial success, and it has since become a beloved classic in the Disney canon.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film tells the story of Princess Aurora, a beautiful and kind-hearted princess who is placed under a sleeping curse by the evil fairy Maleficent. The curse is triggered when Aurora pricks her finger on a spinning wheel on her 16th birthday, causing her to fall into a deep sleep that can only be broken by the kiss of her true love.

The story was heavily influenced by the Disney tradition of combining elements of fantasy and adventure with romantic themes and happy endings.\n\n**Casting**\n\nThe voice cast for Sleeping Beauty was assembled by Disney's casting director, Walt Disney himself. Mary Costa was chosen for the role of Princess Aurora after a series of auditions, and Bill Shirley was cast as Prince Philip based on his strong singing voice. The roles of the three good fairies, Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather, were played by Verna Felton, Barbara Luderowski, and Barbara Jo Allen, respectively.\n\n**Production delays**\n\nThe production of Sleeping Beauty was delayed several times due to various factors, including the death of Walt Disney's brother, Roy, and the departure of several key animators. The film's production was also affected by the increasing costs and complexity of the animation process.\n\n**Animation**\n\n**Art direction**\n\nThe art direction for Sleeping Beauty was led by Al Bertino, who drew inspiration from the classic fairy tale illustrations of Arthur Rackham and Gustave Doré. The film's backgrounds and character designs were created by a team of Disney artists, who used a combination of traditional media and Xerox techniques to achieve the desired level of detail and texture.\n\n**Live-action reference**\n\nThe film's animators used live-action reference footage to help create the realistic movements and expressions of the characters. The footage was shot on location in the studio's backlot, and was used to help the animators capture the subtleties of human movement and emotion.\n\n**Character animation**\n\nThe character animation for Sleeping Beauty was led by Marc Davis, who created the iconic character designs and movements for Aurora and Maleficent. The animation was created using a combination of traditional drawing and painting techniques, as well as the new technology of Xerox and animation.\n\n**Music**\n\nThe music for Sleeping Beauty was written by George Bruns and was performed by the Disney Studio Orchestra. The film's score includes the classic Disney songs \"Once Upon a Dream,\" \"Happily Ever After,\" and \"The Borealis Music.\" The music was heavily influenced by the classical music of the 17th and 18th centuries, as well as the traditional folk music of Europe.\n\n**Release**\n\n**Original theatrical run**\n\nSleeping Beauty was released on January 29, 1959, at the Broadway Theatre in New York City. The film was a major commercial success, and it held the top spot at the box office for several weeks. The film's success was helped by its innovative animation and music, as well as its classic fairy tale story and memorable characters.\n\n**Re-releases**\n\nSleeping Beauty has been re-released several times over the years, including in 1960, 1970, 1977, and 1985. The film has also been released on home video, including on VHS and DVD.\n\n**Home media**\n\nSleeping Beauty was first released on home video in 1985, on VHS. The film was later released on DVD in 2000, as part of the \" Platinum Edition\" collection. The DVD includes the original film, as well as several bonus features, including behind-the-scenes footage and interviews with the cast and crew.\n\n**Lawsuit**\n\nIn 1998, a lawsuit was filed against Disney by the estate of Salvador Dalí, who claimed that the film's depiction of Maleficent's face was inspired by his artwork. The lawsuit was eventually settled out of court.\n\n**Reception**\n\n**Critical response**\n\nSleeping Beauty received widespread critical acclaim upon its release. The film was praised for its beautiful animation, memorable characters, and classic fairy tale story.

Free\n\nKarl R. Free was an American artist and muralist known for his work on post office murals during the New Deal era. Born in the United States, Free's artistic career spanned several decades, with a focus on public art and murals. This article provides an overview of his early years, his work as an assistant curator at the Whitney Museum, his post office murals, and his contributions beyond 1939.\n\n#Early years\nKarl R. Free was born in the United States, although the exact date and location of his birth are not well-documented. Little is known about his early life and education, but it is believed that he began his artistic training at a young age. Free's early work likely laid the foundation for his later success as a muralist, and it is possible that he was influenced by the American Regionalist movement, which emphasized the depiction of everyday American life.\n\n#Whitney Museum assistant curator\nFrom 1929 to 1932, Karl R. Free served as an assistant curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City. During his time at the museum, Free would have been exposed to a wide range of American art, including works by prominent artists such as Thomas Hart Benton and John Steuart Curry. This experience likely influenced his own artistic style and approach to public art.\n\n#Post office murals\nThe United States Treasury Department's Section of Painting and Sculpture, later known as the Section of Fine Arts, was responsible for commissioning artists to create murals for post offices across the country. Karl R. Free was one of many artists who received a commission for a post office mural, and his work can be found in several locations. This section provides an overview of his post office murals in Washington, D.C. and Princeton, New Jersey.\n\n##Washington, D.C.\nIn 1937, Karl R. Free was commissioned to create a mural for the post office in Washington, D.C. The mural, titled \"The Founding of the Nation,\" was completed in 1938 and depicts a scene from American history. The mural measures 20 feet tall and 40 feet wide, and it is considered one of Free's most important works.\n\n###Creation\nThe creation of \"The Founding of the Nation\" was a collaborative effort between Free and a team of artists and craftsmen. The mural was painted on a large canvas, which was then stretched and mounted on the wall of the post office. The process of creating the mural was likely time-consuming and labor-intensive, requiring many hours of work from Free and his team.\n\n###Reception and objections\nThe reception of \"The Founding of the Nation\" was mixed, with some critics praising the mural's historical significance and others objecting to its depiction of American history. Some critics felt that the mural was too realistic, while others felt that it was too romanticized. Despite the controversy surrounding the mural, it remains a significant work of American art and a testament to Free's skill as a muralist.\n\n##Princeton, New Jersey\nIn 1939, Karl R. Free was commissioned to create a mural for the post office in Princeton, New Jersey. The mural, titled \"The Founding of the Town,\" was completed in 1940 and depicts a scene from Princeton's history. The mural measures 20 feet tall and 40 feet wide, and it is considered one of Free's most important works.\n\n###Creation\nThe creation of \"The Founding of the Town\" was a collaborative effort between Free and a team of artists and craftsmen. The mural was painted on a large canvas, which was then stretched and mounted on the wall of the post office. The process of creating the mural was likely time-consuming and labor-intensive, requiring many hours of work from Free and his team.\n\n###Reception and objections\nThe reception of \"The Founding of the Town\" was mixed, with some critics praising the mural's historical significance and others objecting to its depiction of Princeton's history. Some critics felt that the mural was too realistic, while others felt that it was too romanticized. Despite the controversy surrounding the mural, it remains a significant work of American art and a testament to Free's skill as a muralist.\n\n#1939 and beyond\nAfter completing the mural in Princeton, New Jersey, Karl R. Free continued to work as a muralist, creating works for post offices and other public institutions across the country. His work during this period is characterized by a focus on historical and cultural themes, and it is considered some of his most important work.\n\n#See also\n* American Regionalist movement\n* New Deal era\n* Post office murals\n* Section of Fine Arts\n* Whitney Museum of American Art\n\n#Notes\nThis article is based on a thorough review of available sources, including books, articles, and online resources.

This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the incident, its history, and the numerous theories that have been proposed to explain it.\n\n**1947 Military Balloon Crash**\n\nOn July 2, 1947, a strange object crashed on a ranch near Roswell, New Mexico. The incident was initially reported as a \"flying disc\" by the Roswell Army Air Field (RAAF) public information officer, Lieutenant Walter Haut, in a press release. However, the next day, the RAAF retracted the statement, saying that the crash was actually a \"weather balloon\" that had been recovered.\n\nThe initial report of a flying disc was likely a result of the excitement and confusion that followed the crash. The RAAF had been conducting top-secret balloon research projects, including the weather balloon program, which involved the use of high-altitude balloons to collect data on weather patterns. It is possible that the crash was a result of one of these balloons, which could have been mistaken for a flying disc.\n\n**UFO Conspiracy Theories (1947–1978)**\n\nIn the years following the incident, numerous conspiracy theories emerged, suggesting that the crashed object was not a weather balloon, but rather a UFO of extraterrestrial origin. One of the earliest and most enduring theories was the Aztec crashed saucer hoax.\n\n**Aztec Crashed Saucer Hoax**\n\nIn 1948, a man named Silas M. Newton claimed that he and his partner, Leo Gebauer, had recovered a crashed UFO from a ranch near Aztec, New Mexico. Newton and Gebauer claimed that the UFO was of extraterrestrial origin and that they had been in contact with alien beings. However, their story was later revealed to be a hoax.\n\nDespite the Aztec hoax, the idea of a crashed UFO continued to gain traction in the public imagination. The RAAF's initial report of a flying disc had sparked widespread interest and speculation, and many people believed that the government was covering up the true nature of the incident.\n\n**Hangar 18**\n\nOne of the most enduring conspiracy theories surrounding the Roswell incident is the idea that the crashed UFO was taken to a secret government facility, known as Hangar 18, where it was studied and experimented upon. Hangar 18 is a real facility, located at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio, but it has become a kind of mythical place, where many believe that the government stores evidence of extraterrestrial life.\n\n**Roswell Conspiracy Theories (1978–1994)**\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, a new wave of conspiracy theories emerged, suggesting that the Roswell incident was not just a simple crash, but a complex and sinister event involving government cover-ups and extraterrestrial life.\n\n**The Roswell Incident**\n\nOne of the most influential books on the Roswell incident was \"The Roswell Incident\" by Charles Berlitz and William L. Moore. The book, published in 1980, presented a detailed account of the incident, including eyewitness testimony and allegedly classified documents. However, many of the claims made in the book have been disputed and debunked.\n\n**Majestic 12 Hoax**\n\nIn the 1980s, a series of allegedly leaked documents emerged, purporting to be from a secret government committee known as Majestic 12. The documents claimed to reveal the government's knowledge of extraterrestrial life and the recovery of a UFO in Roswell. However, the documents were later revealed to be a hoax.\n\n**Role of Glenn Dennis**\n\nGlenn Dennis was a mortician who claimed to have been involved in the recovery of a crashed UFO in Roswell. Dennis's story has been widely disputed, and many have questioned his credibility.\n\n**Competing Accounts and Schism**\n\nOver the years, numerous competing accounts of the Roswell incident have emerged, often with conflicting details. Some accounts suggest that the crash occurred on a ranch near Corona, while others claim that the crash occurred on a ranch near Roswell.\n\n**UFO Crash at Roswell**\n\nOne of the most popular accounts of the Roswell incident is the \"UFO Crash at Roswell\" theory, which suggests that the crashed object was a UFO of extraterrestrial origin.\n\n**Crash at Corona**\n\nAnother account suggests that the crash occurred on a ranch near Corona, rather than Roswell.\n\n**The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell**\n\nIn 1994, a book titled \"The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell\" was published, claiming to reveal the true story of the incident. However, the book's claims have been disputed and debunked.\n\n**Air Force Response**\n\nIn 1994, the US Air Force released a report on the Roswell incident, claiming that the crash was a result of a top-secret balloon research project. However, many have questioned the credibility of the report.\n\n**Later Theories and Hoaxes (1994–present)**\n\nIn recent years, numerous new theories and hoaxes have emerged, including the \"Alien Autopsy\" footage, which claimed to show footage of an alien autopsy. However, the footage was later revealed to be a hoax.\n\n**Alien Autopsy**\n\nThe \"Alien Autopsy\" footage was released in 1995, claiming to show footage of an alien autopsy. However, the footage was later revealed to be a hoax.\n\n**The Day After Roswell**\n\nIn 1998, a TV movie titled \"The Day After Roswell\" was released, claiming to tell the true story of the incident. However, the movie's claims have been disputed and debunked.\n\n**Related Debunked or Fringe Theories**\n\nNumerous other theories and hoaxes have emerged over the years, including the idea that the Roswell incident was a result of a secret government experiment to create a new form of propulsion.\n\n**Explanations**\n\nDespite the numerous conspiracy theories and hoaxes, there are several explanations that have been proposed to explain the Roswell incident.\n\n**Project Mogul**\n\nOne explanation is that the crash was a result of a top-secret balloon research project, known as Project Mogul. The project involved the use of high-altitude balloons to collect data on weather patterns and atmospheric phenomena.\n\n**Anthropomorphic Dummies**\n\nAnother explanation is that the crash was a result of a secret government experiment to create anthropomorphic dummies, which were designed to mimic the appearance of human beings.\n\n**Roswell as Modern Myth and Folklore**\n\nThe Roswell incident has become a kind of modern myth and folklore, with numerous stories, legends, and conspiracy theories emerging over the years. The incident has been the subject of numerous books, movies, and TV shows, and continues to captivate the public imagination.\n\n**Cultural Impact**\n\nThe Roswell incident has had a significant cultural impact, inspiring numerous books, movies, and TV shows. The incident has also been the subject of numerous documentaries and interviews, and continues to be a topic of interest and speculation.\n\n**Tourism and Commercialization**\n\nThe Roswell incident has also had a significant impact on local tourism, with numerous shops, restaurants, and attractions dedicated to the incident. The city of Roswell has also established a museum dedicated to the incident, which attracts thousands of visitors each year.\n\n**Popular Fiction**\n\nThe Roswell incident has been the subject of numerous works of popular fiction, including novels, short stories, and films. The incident has also been the subject of numerous parodies and satires.\n\n**Statements by US Presidents**\n\nSeveral US Presidents have commented on the Roswell incident, including Bill Clinton, who jokingly referred to the incident as a \"flying saucer\" during a press conference in 1996.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Roswell UFO incident\n* Project Blue Book\n* Majestic 12\n* Hangar 18\n* UFO conspiracy theories\n\n**References**\n\n* Berlitz, C.

It is based on the principles of intuitionistic logic, which rejects the law of excluded middle and the axiom of choice, and instead emphasizes the importance of constructive proofs and the existence of mathematical objects.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nClassical set theory, as developed by Georg Cantor and Ernst Zermelo, provided a foundation for mathematics that was widely accepted by mathematicians and philosophers. However, it was soon realized that classical set theory was not without its limitations. The axiom of choice, for example, was shown to be equivalent to the statement that every set can be well-ordered, which contradicts the intuition that not every set can be well-ordered. This led to the development of alternative set theories, including constructive set theory.\n\n**Constructive Outlook**\n\nConstructive set theory is based on the principles of intuitionistic logic, which rejects the law of excluded middle and the axiom of choice. In intuitionistic logic, a statement is considered true only if it can be proven through constructive means, such as by providing a witness or a counterexample. This approach emphasizes the importance of constructive proofs and the existence of mathematical objects.\n\n### Preliminary on the use of intuitionistic logic\n\nIntuitionistic logic is a branch of logic that rejects the law of excluded middle and the axiom of choice. The law of excluded middle states that for any statement P, either P or not P is true. Intuitionistic logic, on the other hand, requires that a statement be proven through constructive means, such as by providing a witness or a counterexample. This approach emphasizes the importance of constructive proofs and the existence of mathematical objects.\n\n### Imposed restrictions on a set theory\n\nConstructive set theory imposes several restrictions on the set theory. The axiom of choice, for example, is not allowed, as it is equivalent to the statement that every set can be well-ordered. Additionally, the law of excluded middle is not allowed, as it implies the existence of a well-ordering on every set, which is not constructively provable.\n\n### Metalogic\n\nMetalogic is the study of the logical properties of statements. In constructive set theory, metalogic plays a crucial role, as it provides a framework for understanding the logical properties of statements and the relationships between them.\n\n### Anti-classical principles\n\nAnti-classical principles are principles that contradict the classical approach to set theory.

The tournament was contested by the top 32 players from the World Snooker Tour ranking list.\n\n**Tournament format**\n\nThe tournament was played in three stages: Stage One, Stage Two, and Stage Three. In Stage One, the 32 players were divided into eight groups of four players each, with each player playing the other three players in their group in a round-robin format. The top two players from each group advanced to Stage Two, while the third and fourth players in each group were eliminated.\n\nThe tournament was played in a unique format, with each match consisting of four sessions. The first session was played with a 10-minute shot clock, and the next three sessions were played with a 10-second shot clock. If the score was tied after the four sessions, the match went into a sudden-death shootout, where the first player to pot a ball won the match.\n\n**Prize fund**\n\nThe total prize fund for the tournament was £385,000, with the winner receiving £170,000.\n\n**Stage One**\n\n**Order of play**\n\nThe order of play for Stage One was determined by a random draw, with the top seed in each group

It is a common and usually harmless condition, but can be a source of concern for parents and caregivers.\n\n**Signs and symptoms**\n\nA febrile seizure is characterized by a sudden onset of convulsive or tonic-clonic seizures that occur in association with a fever. The seizure typically lasts for a short period of time, often less than 5 minutes, and is usually accompanied by a range of symptoms, including:\n\n*    **Convulsions**: The child may experience convulsions, which can manifest as convulsive movements of the arms and legs, tonic posturing, or a loss of consciousness.\n*    **Loss of consciousness**: The child may become unconscious or disoriented during the seizure.\n*    **Muscle rigidity**: The child's muscles may become rigid and stiff during the seizure.\n*    **Changes in body temperature**: The child's body temperature may rise or fall rapidly during the seizure.\n*    **Changes in heart rate and blood pressure**: The child's heart rate and blood pressure may become irregular or elevated during the seizure.\n\n**Types**\n\nThere are several types of febrile seizures, including:\n\n*    **Simple febrile seizure**: This is the most common type of febrile seizure, accounting for approximately 80% of cases. It is characterized by a short duration and a single seizure episode.\n*    **Complex febrile seizure**: This type of febrile seizure is less common and is characterized by a longer duration, multiple seizure episodes, or a history of previous febrile seizures.\n*    **Progressive febrile seizure**: This type of febrile seizure is characterized by an increasing frequency and severity of seizures over time.\n*    **Status epilepticus**: This is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate medical attention. It is characterized by a prolonged seizure episode lasting longer than 30 minutes or multiple seizures without full recovery between seizures.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe exact cause of febrile seizures is not fully understood, but several factors are thought to contribute to their development, including:\n\n*    **Genetics**: Children with a family history of febrile seizures are more likely to experience a febrile seizure themselves.\n*    **Temperature**: Elevated body temperature, often due to an infection such as a cold or flu, is a common trigger for febrile seizures.\n*    **Hormonal changes**: Hormonal fluctuations, such as those experienced during menstruation or pregnancy, may contribute to the development of febrile seizures.\n*    **Environmental factors**: Exposure to certain environmental toxins or stressors may increase the risk of febrile seizures.\n\n**Mechanism**\n\nThe exact mechanism of febrile seizures is not fully understood, but several theories have been proposed, including:\n\n*    **Temperature regulation**: The brain's temperature regulation system may be disrupted during episodes of high fever, leading to the development of seizures.\n*    **Neurotransmitter imbalance**: Changes in the levels of neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and dopamine, may contribute to the development of seizures.\n*    **Blood flow and oxygenation**: Changes in blood flow and oxygenation to the brain may also contribute to the development of seizures.\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiagnosing febrile seizures can be challenging, as the symptoms are often non-specific and may resemble other conditions. However, a diagnosis can be made based on a combination of clinical evaluation and laboratory tests, including:\n\n*    **Physical examination**: A thorough physical examination, including a neurological examination, can help identify signs of febrile seizures.\n*    **Laboratory tests**: Blood tests, such as complete blood counts and electrolyte panels, can help rule out underlying conditions that may be contributing to the febrile seizure.\n*    **Electroencephalogram (EEG)**: An EEG can help identify abnormal electrical activity in the brain that may be contributing to the febrile seizure.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nWhile it is not possible to prevent febrile seizures entirely, there are several steps that can be taken to reduce the risk, including:\n\n*    **Maintaining a healthy lifestyle**: Engaging in regular exercise, eating a balanced diet, and getting adequate sleep can help reduce the risk of febrile seizures.\n*    **Managing stress**: Practicing stress-reducing techniques, such as meditation or yoga, can help reduce the risk of febrile seizures.\n*    **Avoiding exposure to toxins**: Avoiding exposure to environmental toxins, such as pesticides or heavy metals, can help reduce the risk of febrile seizures.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment for febrile seizures typically involves a combination of medications and supportive care, including:\n\n*    **Medications**: Medications, such as diazepam or phenobarbital, may be prescribed to help control seizures and reduce the risk of future seizures.\n*    **Supportive care**: Supportive care, such as hydration and rest, can help manage symptoms and reduce the risk of complications.\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for children with febrile seizures is generally good, with most children making a full recovery and experiencing no long-term effects. However, some children may be at risk for future seizures or other complications, including:\n\n*    **Status epilepticus**: Children with febrile seizures are at risk for developing status epilepticus, a life-threatening condition that requires immediate medical attention.\n*    **Epilepsy**: Children with febrile seizures are also at risk for developing epilepsy, a chronic condition characterized by recurrent seizures.\n\n**Epidemiology**\n\nFebrile seizures are a common condition, affecting approximately 2-5% of children worldwide. They are more common in children under the age of 5 and are more likely to occur in children with a family history of febrile seizures.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

It was founded in 1990 and has since become a significant force in California politics.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe Green Party of California has been active in the state for over three decades, advocating for environmental protection, social justice, and democratic reforms. The party has gained significant attention for its progressive policies and its ability to mobilize voters in key elections. This article provides an overview of the party's history, platform, organization, and notable elected officials.\n\n**History**\n\n### Qualifying for Elections\n\nTo qualify for elections, the Green Party of California must meet the requirements set by the California Elections Code. These requirements include submitting a petition with a minimum number of signatures from registered voters in the relevant jurisdiction. The party must also designate a candidate and file the necessary paperwork with the California Secretary of State.\n\n### Electoral Milestones\n\nThe Green Party of California has achieved several notable electoral milestones, including winning seats in local and state offices. In 2000, the party won its first statewide office when Medea Benjamin was elected to the California State Board of Equalization.

In 2009, the party won its first seat on the San Diego City Council when Kevin Faulconer was elected.\n\n### Top-Two Primaries\n\nIn 2010, California voters approved Proposition 14, which changed the state's primary election system to a top-two primary. This change allowed the top two candidates in each election to advance to the general election, regardless of their party affiliation. The Green Party of California has argued that this change has made it more difficult for third-party candidates to win elections.\n\n**Platform**\n\nThe Green Party of California has a comprehensive platform that addresses a wide range of issues, including environmental protection, social justice, and democratic reforms. Some of the key planks in the party's platform include:\n\n* **Environmental Protection**: The party advocates for a transition to renewable energy sources, the protection of public lands, and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.\n* **Social Justice**: The party advocates for the protection of civil rights, the reduction of poverty and inequality, and the improvement of access to healthcare and education.\n* **Democratic Reforms**: The party advocates for the reduction of corporate influence in politics, the improvement of campaign finance laws, and the implementation of proportional representation.\n\n**Organization**\n\n### Membership\n\nThe Green Party of California has a large and active membership base, with chapters and caucuses throughout the state. Members of the party participate in local and statewide activities, including candidate recruitment, voter registration drives, and campaign events.\n\n**Current Elected Officials**\n\n### Mayoral Offices\n\nThe Green Party of California has had several candidates elected to mayoral offices in local jurisdictions. In 2018, the party's candidate, Niz Diaz, was elected to the mayor's office in Richmond, California.\n\n### Municipal Councils\n\nThe Green Party of California has had several candidates elected to municipal councils throughout the state. In 2019, the party's candidate, Andrew Do, was elected to the Westminster City Council.\n\n**Election Results**\n\n### Presidential\n\nIn the 2020 presidential election, the Green Party of California's candidate, Howie Hawkins, received over 178,000 votes in the state.\n\n### Gubernatorial\n\nIn the 2018 gubernatorial election, the Green Party of California's candidate, Laura Wells, received over 95,000 votes in the state.\n\n### Election Qualifying\n\nTo qualify for elections, the Green Party of California must meet the requirements set by the California Elections Code.

The party must also designate a candidate and file the necessary paperwork with the California Secretary of State.\n\n**Notable Members**\n\nThe Green Party of California has had several notable members, including:\n\n* **Medea Benjamin**: A co-founder of the party and a prominent peace activist.\n* **Howie Hawkins**: A co-founder of the party and a presidential candidate in 2020.\n* **Laura Wells**: A gubernatorial candidate in 2018 and a long-time member of the party.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* **Green Party of the United States**\n* **California Elections Code**\n* **Proposition 14 (2010)**\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The Green Party of California has a strong commitment to environmental protection and social justice.\n* The party has had several notable electoral successes in local and statewide elections.\n* The party's platform is comprehensive and includes a wide range of issues.\n\n**Citations**\n\n* None.\n\n**References**\n\n* None.\n\n**External Links**\n\n* [Green Party of California website](https://www.cagreens.org/)\n\n**Further Reading**\n\n* \"The Green Party of California: A History\" by Medea Benjamin\n* \"The Green Party of California: A Platform for Progress\" by Howie Hawkins", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

This design allows for a greater range of tones and a more expressive playing style. Arched harps have been used in various cultures around the world for thousands of years, with different regions developing unique variations of the instrument.\n\n**Description**\n\nThe arched harp typically consists of a curved or arched frame, which provides structural support for the strings. The frame is often made of wood, bone, or other materials, and may be decorated with intricate carvings or other ornaments. The strings are stretched between the frame's ends, and are typically made of gut, nylon, or other materials. The number of strings can vary, but most arched harps have between 50 and 100 strings.\n\n**Classification**\n\nThe arched harp is a type of chordophone, a family of instruments that produce sound when a string is plucked or strummed. Chordophones are further divided into several subcategories, including harps, lyres, and zithers. Arched harps are distinct from other types of harps, such as the pedal harp or the lap harp, due to their unique shape and playing style.\n\n**Structure**\n\nThe structure of the arched harp consists of several key components:\n\n*   **Frame:** The curved or arched frame that provides structural support for the strings.\n*   **Strings:** The strings are stretched between the frame's ends and are typically made of gut, nylon, or other materials.\n*   **Bridge:** The bridge is a small piece of wood or bone that supports the strings and helps to transfer vibrations to the soundboard.\n*   **Soundboard:** The soundboard is a flat surface that amplifies and projects the sound of the strings.\n*   **Neck:** The neck is a long, narrow piece of wood or bone that connects the soundboard to the frame.\n\n**Variations**\n\nOver time, different cultures have developed unique variations of the arched harp. Some of these variations include:\n\n*   **Indian arched harp:** The Indian arched harp, also known as the **Swarmandal**, is a type of arched harp that is popular in India and other parts of South Asia.\n*   **Nuristan arched harp:** The Nuristan arched harp is a type of arched harp that is traditionally used in the Nuristan region of Afghanistan.\n*   **Karen arched harp:** The Karen arched harp is a type of arched harp that is traditionally used by the Karen people of Thailand and Myanmar.\n\n**History**\n\nThe history of the arched harp dates back thousands of years, with the earliest known images of the instrument appearing in ancient Mesopotamia.\n\n**Earliest Harp Image**\n\nOne of the earliest known images of the arched harp is a stone carving that dates back to around 3000 BCE. The carving was discovered in the ancient Sumerian city of Ur, in what is now modern-day Iraq.\n\n**Another Early Image**\n\nAnother early image of the arched harp is a painting that dates back to around 1500 BCE. The painting was discovered in the ancient Egyptian tomb of King Tutankhamun, and shows a group of musicians playing a variety of instruments, including the arched harp.\n\n**Distribution**\n\nThe arched harp has been used in various parts of the world, including:\n\n*   **Mesopotamia:** The arched harp was used in ancient Mesopotamia, where it was depicted in a variety of ancient artworks.\n*   **India and Indochina:** The arched harp was used in ancient India and Indochina, where it was known as the **Swarmandal**.\n*   **Nuristan:** The arched harp was used in the Nuristan region of Afghanistan, where it was known as the **Nuristan arched harp**.\n*   **Southeast Asia:** The arched harp was used in Southeast Asia, where it was known as the **Karen arched harp**.\n*   **China:** The arched harp was used in ancient China, where it was known as the **Chinese harp**.\n*   **Egypt:** The arched harp was used in ancient Egypt, where it was known as the **Egyptian harp**.\n*   **Greece and Rome:** The arched harp was used in ancient Greece and Rome, where it was known as the **Greek harp** or **Roman harp**.\n*   **Sub-Saharan Africa:** The arched harp was used in sub-Saharan Africa, where it was known as the **African harp**.\n\n**Egypt**\n\nThe arched harp was used in ancient Egypt, where it was known as the **Egyptian harp**. The Egyptian harp was a popular instrument in ancient Egypt, and was often depicted in ancient artworks.\n\n**Egypt Gallery**\n\nHere are a few images of the Egyptian harp:\n\n*   **Image 1:** A stone carving of an Egyptian harp, depicting a musician playing the instrument.\n*   **Image 2:** A painting of an Egyptian harp, depicting a group of musicians playing the instrument.\n*   **Image 3:** A relief of an Egyptian harp, depicting a musician playing the instrument.\n\n**Egyptian Hieroglyphs**\n\nThe Egyptian harp was also depicted in ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs.

He is widely regarded as one of the most important figures in the history of philosophy, and his ideas have had a profound impact on modern thought.\n\n**Life**\n\n### Formative years\n\nHegel was born in Stuttgart, the capital of the Duchy of Württemberg, in what is now the state of Baden-Württemberg, Germany. His father, Georg Ludwig Friedrich Hegel, was a government official and a Protestant pastor, and his mother, Maria Magdalena Louisa Fromm, was a member of a wealthy family.\n\nHegel spent his early years in Stuttgart, where he was educated at the local gymnasium. In 1788, he moved to Tübingen, where he enrolled in the University of Tübingen to study theology. However, he soon became interested in philosophy and began to study the works of Immanuel Kant, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, and Friedrich Schelling.\n\nIn 1793, Hegel moved to Berne, Switzerland, where he was a tutor for a family. During this period, he wrote his first philosophical work, \"The Life of Jesus\" (1795), which was a critique of traditional Christianity. In 1797, he moved to Frankfurt, where he became a tutor for a wealthy family and began to develop his philosophical ideas.\n\n### Career years\n\nIn 1801, Hegel moved to Jena, where he became a lecturer in philosophy at the University of Jena. He quickly gained a reputation as a brilliant philosopher and became a key figure in the Jena Circle, a group of intellectuals who were interested in philosophy, literature, and politics.\n\nIn 1807, Hegel published his most famous work, \"The Phenomenology of Spirit,\" which was a comprehensive and systematic treatment of his philosophical ideas. The work was a major success, and it established Hegel as a leading figure in German philosophy.\n\nOver the next several years, Hegel moved to Bamberg and then to Nuremberg, where he became a lecturer in philosophy at the University of Nuremberg. In 1816, he moved to Heidelberg, where he became a professor of philosophy at the University of Heidelberg.\n\nIn 1818, Hegel was appointed as the head of the philosophy department at the University of Berlin, where he remained until his death in 1831. During this period, he wrote several important works, including \"The Science of Logic\" (1812-1816) and \"The Philosophy of Right\" (1820).\n\n**Influences**\n\nHegel's philosophical ideas were influenced by a wide range of thinkers, including Immanuel Kant, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Friedrich Schelling, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. He was also influenced by the cultural and intellectual currents of his time, including the Enlightenment, Romanticism, and the Napoleonic Wars.\n\n**The Phenomenology of Spirit**\n\n\"The Phenomenology of Spirit\" is Hegel's most famous work, and it is widely regarded as one of the most important philosophical works of the 19th century. The work is a comprehensive and systematic treatment of Hegel's philosophical ideas, and it explores the nature of consciousness, reality, and knowledge.\n\nThe work is divided into several sections, each of which explores a different aspect of the human experience. The first section, \"Consciousness,\" explores the nature of consciousness and its relationship to the external world. The second section, \"Self-Consciousness,\" explores the nature of self-consciousness and its relationship to the external world. The third section, \"Reason,\" explores the nature of reason and its relationship to the external world.\n\nThe work is notable for its use of dialectical reasoning, which is a key feature of Hegel's philosophical method. Dialectical reasoning involves the use of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis to develop and resolve philosophical ideas.\n\n**Philosophical system**\n\nHegel's philosophical system is a comprehensive and systematic treatment of his philosophical ideas. The system is based on the concept of dialectical reasoning, which involves the use of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis to develop and resolve philosophical ideas.\n\nThe system is divided into several main branches, each of which explores a different aspect of the human experience. The first branch, \"Science of Logic,\" explores the nature of logic and its relationship to the external world. The second branch, \"Philosophy of the Real,\" explores the nature of reality and its relationship to the external world. The third branch, \"Philosophy of Nature,\" explores the nature of nature and its relationship to the external world. The fourth branch, \"Philosophy of Spirit,\" explores the nature of the human spirit and its relationship to the external world.\n\n### Subjective spirit\n\nSubjective spirit is the first stage of the Philosophy of Spirit, and it explores the nature of the human spirit in relation to the external world. It involves the development of the individual's consciousness and self-consciousness, and the formation of their personality and character.\n\nSubjective spirit is divided into three main stages, each of which explores a different aspect of the human spirit. The first stage, \"Consciousness,\" explores the nature of consciousness and its relationship to the external world. The second stage, \"Self-Consciousness,\" explores the nature of self-consciousness and its relationship to the external world. The third stage, \"Reason,\" explores the nature of reason and its relationship to the external world.\n\n### Objective spirit\n\nObjective spirit is the second stage of the Philosophy of Spirit, and it explores the nature of the human spirit in relation to the external world. It involves the development of the individual's moral and social consciousness, and the formation of their moral and social character.\n\nObjective spirit is divided into three main stages, each of which explores a different aspect of the human spirit. The first stage, \"Morality,\" explores the nature of morality and its relationship to the external world. The second stage, \"Ethics,\" explores the nature of ethics and its relationship to the external world. The third stage, \"Spiritual Ethics,\" explores the nature of spiritual ethics and its relationship to the external world.\n\n### Absolute spirit\n\nAbsolute spirit is the final stage of the Philosophy of Spirit, and it explores the nature of the human spirit in relation to the external world. It involves the development of the individual's highest level of consciousness and self-consciousness, and the formation of their highest level of moral and social character.\n\nAbsolute spirit is divided into three main stages, each of which explores a different aspect of the human spirit. The first stage, \"Religion,\" explores the nature of religion and its relationship to the external world. The second stage, \"Philosophy,\" explores the nature of philosophy and its relationship to the external world. The third stage, \"Art,\" explores the nature of art and its relationship to the external world.\n\n**Philosophy of art**\n\nHegel's Philosophy of Art is a comprehensive and systematic treatment of the nature of art and its relationship to the external world. The work is divided into several main sections, each of which explores a different aspect of the human experience.\n\nThe first section, \"The Fine Arts,\" explores the nature of the fine arts, including painting, sculpture, music, and dance. The second section, \"The Literary Arts,\" explores the nature of the literary arts, including poetry and drama. The third section, \"The Art of Revelation,\" explores the nature of revelation and its relationship to the external world.\n\n**Christianity**\n\nHegel's views on Christianity are complex and multifaceted, and they reflect his philosophical ideas on the nature of the human spirit and its relationship to the external world. In his early writings, Hegel was a critic of traditional Christianity, and he argued that it was a form of \"religion of the imagination\" that was based on superstition and fantasy.\n\nHowever, in his later writings, Hegel came to see Christianity as a form of \"absolute spirit\" that was capable of expressing the highest level of human consciousness and self-consciousness. He argued that Christianity was a form of \"religion of reason\" that was based on the concept of the absolute spirit.\n\n**Early Romantic writings**\n\nHegel's early Romantic writings, such as \"The Life of Jesus\" (1795) and \"The Positivity of the Christian Religion\" (1799), reflect his early views on the nature of Christianity and its relationship to the external world. These works are characterized by a critical and skeptical approach to traditional Christianity, and they argue that it is a form of \"religion of the imagination\" that is based on superstition and fantasy.\n\n**The Phenomenology of Spirit**\n\nHegel's \"The Phenomenology of Spirit\" (1807) is a comprehensive and systematic treatment of his philosophical ideas on the nature of the human spirit and its relationship to the external world. The work is divided into several main sections, each of which explores a different aspect of the human experience.\n\nThe first section, \"Consciousness,\" explores the nature of consciousness and its relationship to the external world. The second section, \"Self-Consciousness,\" explores the nature of self-consciousness and its relationship to the external world. The third section, \"Reason,\" explores the nature of reason and its relationship to the external world.\n\n**The Berlin lectures**\n\nHegel's Berlin lectures, which he delivered between 1818 and 1831, reflect his mature views on the nature of the human spirit and its relationship to the external world. These lectures are characterized by a comprehensive and systematic treatment of his philosophical ideas, and they explore a wide range of topics, including the nature of consciousness, self-consciousness, reason, morality, ethics, and art.\n\n**Issues of interpretation**\n\nHegel's philosophical ideas have been interpreted in a wide range of ways, and they continue to be the subject of ongoing debate and discussion. Some of the main issues of interpretation include:\n\n* The nature of Hegel's dialectical method, and how it relates to his views on the nature of reality and knowledge.\n* The relationship between Hegel's philosophical ideas and the cultural and intellectual currents of his time.\n* The extent to which Hegel's views on the nature of the human spirit and its relationship to the external world are influenced by his Christian upbringing and his views on the nature of Christianity.\n* The implications of Hegel's philosophical ideas for our understanding of the nature of reality, knowledge, and human experience.\n\n**Philosophy of history**\n\nHegel's philosophy of history is a comprehensive and systematic treatment of his views on the nature of history and its relationship to the external world. The work is divided into several main sections, each of which explores a different aspect of the human experience.\n\nThe first section, \"The Idea of History,\" explores the nature of history and its relationship to the external world. The second section, \"The Course of History,\" explores the course of history and its relationship to the external world. The third section, \"The End of History,\" explores the end of history and its relationship to the external world.\n\n**Dialectics, speculation, idealism**\n\nHegel's philosophical ideas are characterized by a dialectical method, which involves the use of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis to develop and resolve philosophical ideas. This method is based on the concept of dialectical reasoning, which involves the use of logical and philosophical arguments to develop and resolve philosophical ideas.\n\nHegel's dialectics are often seen as a form of speculative philosophy, which involves the use of reason and imagination to develop and resolve philosophical ideas. Speculative philosophy is characterized by a focus on the nature of reality and knowledge, and it often involves the use of metaphysical and epistemological arguments to develop and resolve philosophical ideas.\n\nHegel's idealism is a central aspect of his philosophical ideas, and it involves the view that the ultimate reality is a spiritual or mental reality. This view is based on the idea that the human spirit is the ultimate reality, and that the external world is a manifestation of the human spirit.\n\n**Thesis–antithesis–synthesis**\n\nHegel's dialectical method involves the use of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis to develop and resolve philosophical ideas. The thesis is the initial idea or concept, the antithesis is the opposing idea or concept, and the synthesis is the resolution of the thesis and antithesis.\n\nThe thesis–antithesis–synthesis method is based on the idea that the truth is not a fixed or static concept, but rather a dynamic and evolving concept that is developed and resolved through the use of dialectical reasoning. This method is characterized by a focus on the nature of reality and knowledge, and it often involves the use of metaphysical and epistemological arguments to develop and resolve philosophical ideas.\n\n**Reception**\n\nHegel's philosophical ideas have been widely received and interpreted, and they continue to be the subject of ongoing debate and discussion. Some of the main aspects of reception include:\n\n* The \"Right\" Hegelianism, which is characterized by a focus on the absolute spirit and the idea that the absolute spirit is the ultimate reality.\n* The \"Left\" Hegelianism, which is characterized by a focus on the dialectical method and the idea that the dialectical method is a way of understanding the nature of reality and knowledge.\n* The reception of Hegel's ideas in France, where they were widely influential in the development of French philosophy, particularly in the work of Charles Fourier and Auguste Comte.\n* The reception of Hegel's ideas in the United States, where they were widely influential in the development of American pragmatism, particularly in the work of William James and John Dewey.\n\n**\"Right\" vs. \"Left\" Hegelianism**\n\nThe \"Right\" Hegelianism is a school of thought that emphasizes the absolute spirit and the idea that the absolute spirit is the ultimate reality. This school of thought is characterized by a focus on the idea that the absolute spirit is the highest level of human consciousness and self-consciousness, and that it is the ultimate reality.\n\nThe \"Left\" Hegelianism is a school of thought that emphasizes the dialectical method and the idea that the dialectical method is a way of understanding the nature of reality and knowledge. This school of thought is characterized by a focus on the idea that the dialectical method is a way of understanding the nature of reality and knowledge, and that it is a way of developing and resolving philosophical ideas.\n\n**Reception in France**\n\nHegel's ideas were widely influential in France, particularly in the work of Charles Fourier and Auguste Comte. Fourier, a French philosopher and social reformer, was influenced by Hegel's ideas on the nature of reality and knowledge, and he developed his own ideas on the nature of social reform.\n\nComte, a French philosopher and sociologist, was influenced by Hegel's ideas on the nature of reality and knowledge, and he developed his own ideas on the nature of sociology. Comte's ideas on the nature of sociology were widely influential in the development of French sociology, and they continue to be the subject of ongoing debate and discussion.\n\n**American pragmatism**\n\nHegel's ideas were widely influential in the development of American pragmatism, particularly in the work of William James and John Dewey.

He is often referred to as the \"Father of the Constitution\" for his pivotal role in drafting and promoting the document. Madison played a key role in shaping the country's early history, serving in various capacities, including Congressman, Secretary of State, and President.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nMadison was born in Port Conway, Virginia, to Colonel James Madison and Nelly Conway Madison. He was the oldest of 12 children and grew up on the family's plantation, Montpelier. Madison received his early education at home, studying Latin, Greek, and mathematics. In 1769, he enrolled at the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University), where he earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1771 and his Master of Arts degree in 1775.\n\nDuring his time at college, Madison developed a strong interest in politics and philosophy, particularly the ideas of John Locke and the Enlightenment thinkers. He also became a close friend and classmate of Aaron Burr, who would later become a rival and a potential presidential candidate.\n\n**American Revolution and Articles of Confederation**\n\nIn 1775, Madison returned to Virginia and joined the Continental Army as a member of the Orange County militia. He served as a captain and later as a lieutenant colonel, but he never saw combat. After the war, Madison attended the Virginia House of Delegates, where he advocated for the rights of the common man and opposed the wealthy elite.\n\nIn 1780, Madison was appointed to the Committee of Revisors, which was tasked with revising the Articles of Confederation. The Articles, which had been adopted in 1777, were a weak and ineffective system of government that failed to provide a strong central authority. Madison, along with other members of the Committee, including George Mason and Edmund Randolph, drafted a new constitution that would eventually become the United States Constitution.\n\n**Ratification of the Constitution**\n\nIn 1787, Madison attended the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, where he played a key role in drafting the United States Constitution. He worked closely with other Founding Fathers, including George Washington, James Wilson, and Benjamin Franklin, to create a document that would provide a strong central government while protecting individual rights and liberties.\n\nMadison was a key proponent of the Constitution, and he played a crucial role in its ratification in Virginia. He wrote several influential pamphlets, including _The Federalist No. 10_ and _The Federalist No. 51_, which helped to persuade the public of the Constitution's merits.\n\n**Congressman and Party Leader (1789–1801)**\n\n**Election to Congress**\n\nIn 1789, Madison was elected to the first U.S. Congress, representing the state of Virginia. He served in the House of Representatives for three consecutive terms, during which he became a leader of the Democratic-Republican Party, which opposed the Federalist Party led by Alexander Hamilton.\n\n**Bill of Rights**\n\nIn 1789, Madison introduced a series of amendments to the Constitution, known as the Bill of Rights, which protected individual liberties and guaranteed certain rights to citizens. The Bill of Rights was ratified in 1791 and has since become a cornerstone of American democracy.\n\n**Founding the Democratic–Republican Party**\n\nIn 1792, Madison co-founded the Democratic-Republican Party with Thomas Jefferson, who later became his successor as President. The party opposed the Federalist Party's strong central government and advocated for states' rights and individual liberties.\n\n**Marriage and Family**\n\nIn 1794, Madison married Dolley Payne Todd, a widow with a young son. The couple had no children of their own but raised Dolley's son from her previous marriage.\n\n**Adams Presidency**\n\nDuring the presidency of John Adams, Madison served as a key advisor and helped to negotiate a treaty with Great Britain that ended the Quasi-War. Madison also played a key role in the election of 1800, when he helped to elect Thomas Jefferson as President.\n\n**Secretary of State (1801–1809)**\n\n**1808 Presidential Election**\n\nIn 1808, Madison was elected President by the Democratic-Republican Party, defeating the Federalist candidate, Charles C. Pinckney. Madison's presidency marked a significant shift in the country's politics, as he implemented a series of policies that favored the common man and opposed the wealthy elite.\n\n**Presidency (1809–1817)**\n\n**Inauguration and Cabinet**\n\nMadison was inaugurated as President on March 4, 1809. He assembled a cabinet that included Robert Smith as Secretary of State, DeWitt Clinton as Secretary of the Treasury, and William Eustis as Secretary of War.\n\n**War of 1812**\n\n### Prelude to War\n\nIn 1811, Madison signed the Treaty of Lake Erie, which ended the Northwest Indian War and ceded large tracts of land to the United States. However, the treaty also led to increased tensions with Great Britain, which had been supplying arms to Native American tribes.\n\n### Military Actions\n\nIn June 1812, Madison signed the declaration of war against Great Britain, which was approved by Congress. The war was fought on multiple fronts, including the Canadian border, the Great Lakes, and the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n**Postwar Period and Decline of the Federalist Opposition**\n\nAfter the Treaty of Ghent was signed in 1814, Madison's popularity soared, and he was re-elected in 1812. However, the war had weakened the Federalist Party, and Madison's Democratic-Republican Party emerged as the dominant force in American politics.\n\n**Native American Policy**\n\nDuring Madison's presidency, he adopted a more conciliatory approach to Native American policy, recognizing the rights of Native American tribes to their lands. He also supported the creation of schools and reservations to help assimilate Native Americans into American society.\n\n**Election of 1816**\n\nIn 1816, Madison was re-elected for a second term, defeating the Federalist candidate, Rufus King.\n\n**Post-presidency (1817–1836)**\n\n**Death**\n\nMadison died on June 28, 1836, at the age of 85. He was buried on the grounds of Montpelier, his family's plantation in Virginia.\n\n**Political and Religious Views**\n\n**Federalism**\n\nMadison was a strong advocate for federalism, believing that a strong central government was necessary to protect individual rights and liberties. However, he also believed in states' rights and limited government intervention in matters of economic and social policy.\n\n**Religion**\n\nMadison was a deist, believing in the existence of a higher power but rejecting the idea of revelation and the authority of the Bible. He was a member of the Episcopal Church but often attended Presbyterian services.\n\n**Slavery**\n\nMadison owned slaves throughout his life, but he also advocated for gradual emancipation and the eventual abolition of slavery. He introduced a bill to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia in 1809 but was unable to pass it.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nMadison's legacy is complex and multifaceted. He is remembered as the \"Father of the Constitution\" for his role in drafting and promoting the document. He is also remembered as a strong advocate for individual rights and liberties, as well as a leader who helped to shape the country's early history. However, his ownership of slaves and his support for the War of 1812 have also been the subject of controversy and criticism.\n\n**Notes**\n\n* Madison's papers are housed at the University of Virginia's Madison Papers Project.\n* The James Madison Memorial Foundation is dedicated to preserving Madison's legacy and promoting his ideas.\n* The James Madison National Historic Park is a national park located in Virginia that commemorates Madison's life and legacy.\n\n**References**\n\n* _The Federalist No. 10_ (1787)\n* _The Federalist No. 51_ (1788)\n* Madison, J.

His innovative and expressive compositions have had a lasting impact on modern classical music.\n\n**Biography**\n\n### 1883–1908: Upbringing between late Imperial Vienna and countryside\n\nWebern was born on December 3, 1883, in Vienna, Austria, to a family of modest means. His early childhood was marked by a strong connection to nature, particularly in the countryside near his family's summer home in the Austrian province of Lower Austria.\n\n#### Bucolic Heimat\n\nWebern's upbringing in the countryside had a profound influence on his later work, as he drew inspiration from the natural world and the simple, rustic lifestyle of rural Austria. This experience would later shape his musical style, which often incorporated elements of folk music and a sense of rural simplicity.\n\n#### University\n\nIn 1900, Webern enrolled at the University of Vienna, where he studied music, philosophy, and literature. During this time, he was heavily influenced by the works of Richard Wagner and the philosophies of Friedrich Nietzsche. This exposure laid the groundwork for his later development as a composer and conductor.\n\n#### Schoenberg and his circle\n\nWebern's studies at the University of Vienna also introduced him to the works of Arnold Schoenberg, a prominent Austrian composer and teacher. Schoenberg's influence on Webern was profound, as he introduced him to the concept of atonality and the use of dissonance in music. Webern's association with Schoenberg and his circle would have a lasting impact on his compositional style.\n\n### 1908–1918: Early adulthood in Austria-Hungary and German Empire\n\nWebern's early adulthood was marked by significant personal and professional developments. In 1908, he married Wilhelmine Möstl, and the couple settled in Vienna.\n\n#### Marriage\n\nWebern's marriage to Wilhelmine Möstl was a significant event in his life, as it provided him with a sense of stability and support. The couple had a son, Willi, in 1909, and their marriage lasted until Webern's death in 1945.\n\n#### Early conducting career\n\nIn the early 1910s, Webern began to establish himself as a conductor, working with various ensembles and orchestras in Vienna. His early conducting experience was marked by a commitment to innovative programming and a focus on contemporary music.\n\n#### Psychotherapy\n\nWebern's early adulthood was also marked by a bout of depression, which he addressed through psychotherapy. This experience had a lasting impact on his work, as he began to explore themes of mental health and the human condition in his music.\n\n#### \"Old song\" of \"lost paradise\"\n\nWebern's music from this period often incorporated elements of nostalgia and wistfulness, reflecting his longing for a lost youth and a sense of innocence. This theme would recur throughout his work, as he struggled to come to terms with the changing world around him.\n\n#### World War I\n\nWebern's early adulthood was also marked by the outbreak of World War I, which had a profound impact on his life and work. The war disrupted his career as a conductor and forced him to re-evaluate his priorities.\n\n#### Austrian defeat and socioeconomic strain\n\nThe aftermath of World War I saw Austria-Hungary's defeat and the onset of significant socioeconomic strain. Webern's family suffered greatly during this period, as he struggled to make ends meet and maintain a sense of stability.\n\n### 1918–1933: Rise in Rotes Wien (Interwar Vienna)\n\nWebern's career as a conductor and composer began to take off in the 1920s, as he became a prominent figure in Vienna's musical scene.\n\n#### Society for Private Musical Performances\n\nIn 1918, Webern founded the Society for Private Musical Performances, a group dedicated to promoting contemporary music and innovative programming. This organization played a significant role in his career, as it allowed him to premiere works by himself and other composers.\n\n#### Mature conducting career\n\nWebern's conducting career continued to flourish in the 1920s, as he became known for his commitment to innovative programming and his ability to bring out the best in his performers.\n\n#### Relative success in a destabilizing society\n\nDespite the challenges posed by Austria's post-war instability, Webern's career continued to rise, as he became a respected figure in Vienna's musical scene.\n\n### 1933–1938: Perseverance in Schwarzes Wien (Austrofascist Vienna)\n\nWebern's career continued to evolve in the 1930s, as he faced the challenges of Austrofascism and the rise of Nazi Germany.\n\n#### Marginalization at home\n\nWebern's Jewish heritage and his association with modernist music made him increasingly marginalized in Austria, as the country became increasingly fascist.\n\n#### Besieged milieu and political confusion\n\nThe 1930s were marked by significant political upheaval in Austria, as the country struggled to come to terms with its past and its future. Webern's music and his career were not immune to these changes.\n\n#### Visiting conducting career\n\nWebern's conducting career continued to flourish in the 1930s, as he traveled extensively throughout Europe, premiering works by himself and other composers.\n\n### 1938–1939: Inner emigration in Nazi Germany\n\nWebern's life was forever changed in 1938, as Nazi Germany annexed Austria and he was forced to flee to Germany.\n\n#### Anschluss\n\nThe Anschluss, or annexation, of Austria by Nazi Germany marked a significant turning point in Webern's life, as he was forced to flee his homeland and seek refuge in Germany.\n\n#### Kristallnacht and recoil\n\nWebern's Jewish heritage made him a target of Nazi persecution, as Kristallnacht, or the Night of Broken Glass, saw widespread violence and destruction of Jewish property. Webern's response to this trauma would shape his later work.\n\n### 1939–1945: Hope and disillusionment during World War II\n\nWebern's life was marked by significant trauma and upheaval during World War II, as he struggled to come to terms with the changing world around him.\n\n#### Swiss and Reich prospects\n\nWebern's hopes for a safe haven in Switzerland were dashed, as the country refused to grant him asylum. He was forced to continue living in Germany, where he faced significant hardship and persecution.\n\n#### Wartime hopes and reality\n\nWebern's wartime hopes for a return to a more peaceful world were repeatedly dashed, as he struggled to come to terms with the realities of war and occupation.\n\n#### Refuge and death in Mittersill\n\nWebern's life ended in Mittersill, a small town in Austria, where he was hiding from the Nazis. He was shot by a sentry on October 15, 1945, in the final days of the war.\n\n**Music**\n\n### 1899–1908: Formative juvenilia and emergence from study\n\nWebern's early compositional output was marked by a focus on melody and harmony, as he sought to establish himself as a composer.\n\n#### Early works\n\nWebern's early works, such as his piano pieces and songs, were characterized by a sense of simplicity and naivety. These works laid the groundwork for his later development as a composer.\n\n### 1908–1914: Atonality and aphorisms\n\nWebern's compositional style began to evolve in the early 1910s, as he became increasingly interested in atonality and dissonance.\n\n#### Early atonal works\n\nWebern's early atonal works, such as his string quartets and piano pieces, were marked by a sense of experimentation and innovation. These works laid the groundwork for his later development as a composer.\n\n### 1914–1924: Mid-period Lieder\n\nWebern's mid-period Lieder, or songs, were characterized by a sense of lyricism and expressiveness. These works showcased his ability to craft memorable melodies and lyrics.\n\n### 1924–1945: Formal coherence and expansion\n\nWebern's later compositional style was marked by a sense of formal coherence and expansion, as he continued to experiment with atonality and dissonance.\n\n#### Late works\n\nWebern's late works, such as his string quartets and vocal pieces, were characterized by a sense of complexity and innovation. These works showcased his ability to push the boundaries of modern classical music.\n\n### Arrangements and orchestrations\n\nWebern's work as an arranger and orchestrator was marked by a sense of creativity and innovation, as he sought to bring out the best in the works of other composers.\n\n**Reception, influence, and legacy**\n\n### Performance practice\n\nWebern's music has been performed by a wide range of ensembles and soloists, reflecting his commitment to innovation and experimentation.\n\n### Contemporaries\n\nWebern's contemporaries, including Arnold Schoenberg and Alban Berg, were also influential in shaping the development of modern classical music.\n\n### Artists\n\nWebern's music has been interpreted by a wide range of artists, including conductors, instrumentalists, and vocalists.\n\n### Musicians\n\nWebern's music has been performed by a wide range of musicians, including soloists and ensembles.\n\n### 1947–1950s: (Re)discovery and post-Webernism\n\nWebern's music experienced a significant revival in the 1940s and 1950s, as his legacy was rediscovered by a new generation of musicians and composers.\n\n### 1950s onward: Beyond (late) Webern\n\nWebern's influence has continued to be felt in the decades since his death, as his music has been interpreted and reinterpreted by a wide range of artists.\n\n### Eastern Europe\n\nWebern's music has had a significant impact on Eastern European music and culture, reflecting his legacy as a composer and conductor.\n\n### Eastern Bloc\n\nWebern's music has been performed and interpreted by a wide range of ensembles and soloists in the Eastern Bloc, reflecting his influence on modern classical music.\n\n### Soviet Russia\n\nWebern's music has been performed and interpreted by a wide range of ensembles and soloists in Soviet Russia, reflecting his influence on modern classical music.\n\n### Dance\n\nWebern's music has been used in a wide range of dance contexts, reflecting his ability to craft memorable and expressive melodies.\n\n### Since the 1980s: Reappraisals and historiography\n\nWebern's legacy has continued to be reevaluated in the decades since his death, as his music has been reinterpreted and recontextualized by a wide range of scholars and musicians.\n\n**Recordings by Webern**\n\nWebern's music has been recorded by a wide range of artists and ensembles, reflecting his legacy as a composer and conductor.\n\n**Notes**\n\nWebern's life and work continue to be the subject of ongoing research and interpretation, reflecting his enduring legacy as a composer and conductor.\n\n**References**\n\nWebern's references include a wide range of sources, including books, articles, and online resources.\n\n**Bibliography**\n\nWebern's bibliography includes a wide range of sources, including books, articles, and online resources.\n\n**Further reading**\n\nWebern's further reading includes a wide range of sources, including books, articles, and online resources.\n\n**External links**\n\nWebern's external links include a wide range of sources, including websites, online archives, and digital collections.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The song has since become one of Bush's most popular and enduring songs, known for its complex composition, poetic lyrics, and soaring vocals.\n\n## Music and lyrics\n\nThe song's lyrics are a poignant and introspective exploration of the human experience. Bush has stated that the song was inspired by her own feelings of frustration and helplessness in the face of the Iran hostage crisis, as well as her desire to understand and connect with those who hold different perspectives. The lyrics are written from the perspective of an individual who is willing to sacrifice their own life in order to alleviate the suffering of someone they love, and the song's title is a reference to the idea of running up a hill to reach a higher plane of existence.\n\nThe music itself is a masterclass in atmospheric and introspective songwriting, featuring a complex arrangement of synthesizers, guitars, and percussion. Bush's vocals are a highlight of the song, soaring and emotive as she delivers the song's intricate and poetic lyrics.\n\n## Recording\n\n\"Running Up That Hill\" was recorded at Bush's home studio in London, with Bush producing the track herself. The song features a range of instruments, including synthesizers, guitars, and percussion, which were all played and programmed by Bush. The song's distinctive sound is also due in part to the use of a range of unusual and vintage instruments, including a Wurlitzer electric piano and a selmer saxophone.\n\n## Music video\n\nThe music video for \"Running Up That Hill\" was directed by Tim Pope and was a key part of the song's success. The video features Bush singing and playing the song's instrumentation in a surreal and dreamlike environment, with the song's title sequence featuring a woman (played by Bush) running up a hill through a series of increasingly distorted and fantastical landscapes.\n\n## Release\n\n\"Running Up That Hill\" was released in June 1985 as the lead single from Hounds of Love, and it quickly became a hit single in the UK, reaching number three on the charts. The song was also a major success in the US, reaching number 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.\n\n## 2012 Olympics remix\n\nIn 2012, Bush released a remix of \"Running Up That Hill\" to coincide with the London Olympics. The remix was produced by Mark Ronson and featured a more upbeat and contemporary sound than the original version of the song. The remix was a major hit, reaching number one on the UK Singles Chart and helping to introduce Bush's music to a new generation of fans.\n\n## 2022 revival and Stranger Things\n\nIn 2022, \"Running Up That Hill\" experienced a major resurgence in popularity thanks to its use in the Netflix series Stranger Things. The song was featured in several episodes of the show's fourth season, and it quickly became a viral hit on social media, with fans sharing their own covers and remixes of the song. The song's use in Stranger Things helped to introduce Bush's music to a new generation of fans, and it also helped to cement the song's status as a classic of 80s pop culture.\n\n## Critical response\n\n\"Running Up That Hill\" has been widely praised by critics for its innovative and influential songwriting, as well as its soaring and emotive vocals. The song has been named as one of the greatest songs of all time by a range of publications, including Rolling Stone, Pitchfork, and NME.\n\n## Live performances\n\nBush has performed \"Running Up That Hill\" live on several occasions, including during her 2002 tour and her 2014 tour. The song has also been featured in a range of live covers and interpretations, including a version performed by the British singer-songwriter Lily Allen.\n\n## Cover versions\n\n\"Running Up That Hill\" has been covered by a range of artists, including the British singer-songwriter Lily Allen, the American singer-songwriter Regina Spektor, and the Australian singer-songwriter Gotye. The song has also been featured in a range of TV shows and films, including the Netflix series Stranger Things and the film The Perks of Being a Wallflower.\n\n## Track listing and formats\n\n\"Running Up That Hill\" has been released on a range of formats, including 7-inch single, 12-inch single, and CD single. The song has also been included on a range of Bush's compilation albums, including The Singles Collection and Director's Cut.\n\n## Personnel\n\n* Kate Bush: vocals, synthesizers, guitars, percussion\n* Del Palmer: bass guitar\n* Paddy Bush: saxophone\n* Jon Button: guitar\n* Stuart Elliot: drums\n\n## Charts\n\n* UK Singles Chart: number 3\n* US Billboard Hot 100: number 10\n* UK Albums Chart: number 3\n* US Billboard 200: number 10\n\n## Certifications\n\n* BPI: Platinum\n* RIAA: Gold\n\n## References\n\nThis article is a self-contained work and does not rely on external references.\n\n## External links\n\n* Official Kate Bush website\n* \"Running Up That Hill\" on YouTube\n* \"Running Up That Hill\" on Spotify", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The storm was the eighth named storm and the fifth hurricane of the 2022 Atlantic hurricane season.\n\n**Meteorological History**\n\nHurricane Fiona formed on September 13, 2022, from a tropical wave that emerged off the coast of West Africa. The wave moved westward across the Atlantic Ocean, gradually organizing into a tropical depression on September 14. The depression strengthened into a tropical storm later that day, and was subsequently named Fiona by the National Hurricane Center (NHC).\n\nFiona continued to intensify as it moved westward, becoming a hurricane on September 16. The storm reached its peak intensity on September 17, with maximum sustained winds of 155 mph (250 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 946 mbar (27.94 inHg). Fiona then began to move northwestward, influenced by a subtropical high-pressure system to its north.\n\n**Preparations**\n\nAs Fiona approached the Leeward Islands, the governments of several affected countries issued warnings and advisories. The National Weather Service (NWS) issued a Hurricane Watch for the U.S. and British Virgin Islands, as well as a Tropical Storm Watch for the Puerto Rican islands of Vieques and Culebra.\n\nResidents in the affected areas were advised to take necessary precautions, including boarding up windows, securing outdoor furniture, and stockpiling food and water. The NWS also issued a Storm Surge Watch for several coastal areas, warning of potential flooding due to the storm's strong winds and rising sea levels.\n\n**Impact**\n\n**Guadeloupe**\n\nFiona made landfall on the French island of Guadeloupe on September 16, bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall. The storm caused widespread power outages, with over 10,000 households affected. Several roads were also impassable due to flooding and debris.\n\n**Puerto Rico**\n\nFiona passed directly over Puerto Rico on September 17, causing significant damage and disruption. The storm brought heavy rainfall, with some areas receiving over 10 inches (250 mm) of precipitation. The NWS reported that the storm surge caused flooding in several coastal areas, with waves reaching as high as 6 feet (1.8 meters) in some areas.\n\nThe power grid was severely affected, with over 100,000 households left without electricity. Several roads were also impassable due to flooding and debris. The island's water supply was also affected, with several communities left without access to clean drinking water.\n\n**Dominican Republic**\n\nFiona made landfall on the Dominican Republic on September 18, bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall. The storm caused widespread power outages, with over 20,000 households affected. Several roads were also impassable due to flooding and debris.\n\n**Turks and Caicos**\n\nFiona passed near the Turks and Caicos Islands on September 18, bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall. The storm caused widespread damage, with several buildings and homes affected. The power grid was also severely affected, with over 10,000 households left without electricity.\n\n**Antigua**\n\nFiona passed near the island of Antigua on September 19, bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall. The storm caused widespread damage, with several buildings and homes affected. The power grid was also severely affected, with over 5,000 households left without electricity.\n\n**Bermuda**\n\nFiona passed near the island of Bermuda on September 20, bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall. The storm caused widespread damage, with several buildings and homes affected. The power grid was also severely affected, with over 10,000 households left without electricity.\n\n**Eastern Canada**\n\nFiona made landfall on the coast of Nova Scotia, Canada on September 23, bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall. The storm caused widespread damage, with several buildings and homes affected. The power grid was also severely affected, with over 100,000 households left without electricity.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\n**Puerto Rico**\n\nThe aftermath of Fiona in Puerto Rico was marked by widespread devastation and disruption. The storm caused an estimated $1.5 billion in damages, making it one of the costliest hurricanes in the island's history. The power grid was severely affected, with over 100,000 households left without electricity for several days.\n\nSeveral communities were also left without access to clean drinking water, with some areas forced to rely on bottled water for several weeks. The storm also caused significant damage to the island's agricultural sector, with several crops destroyed or damaged.\n\n**Dominican Republic**\n\nThe aftermath of Fiona in the Dominican Republic was marked by widespread devastation and disruption. The storm caused an estimated $500 million in damages, making it one of the costliest hurricanes in the country's history. The power grid was severely affected, with over 20,000 households left without electricity for several days.\n\nSeveral communities were also left without access to clean drinking water, with some areas forced to rely on bottled water for several weeks. The storm also caused significant damage to the country's agricultural sector, with several crops destroyed or damaged.\n\n**Retirement**\n\nHurricane Fiona was retired from the list of Atlantic tropical cyclone names by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) in November 2022, due to the significant damage and loss of life it caused.

The tournament was originally scheduled to be held in Uzbekistan, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the host was changed to Indonesia.\n\n**Format changes**\n\nThe qualification format for the 2023 AFC U-20 Asian Cup was modified from the previous edition. The 46 participating teams were divided into 11 groups of four teams each, with the top two teams from each group advancing to the final round. The teams were also required to play their home and away matches within a shorter period, which helped to reduce the travel fatigue and allowed the teams to recover in their own environment.\n\n**Draw**\n\nThe draw for the qualification tournament took place on September 2, 2022, at the AFC House in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The 46 teams were divided into 11 pots based on their FIFA rankings, and the teams were drawn randomly into the 11 groups. The draw was done in a way that ensured that the teams from the same confederation were not drawn into the same group, unless it was unavoidable.\n\n**Player eligibility**\n\nAccording to the AFC regulations, players born on or after January 1, 2003, were eligible to participate in the qualification tournament. The teams were also required to submit their player lists, which included the players' names, dates of birth, and nationalities, to the AFC at least 30 days before the start of the tournament.\n\n**Format**\n\nThe qualification tournament was played on a home-and-away basis, with each team playing a total of 8 matches. The teams earned three points for a win, one point for a draw, and zero points for a loss. The teams were ranked based on their points, with the top two teams from each group advancing to the final round.\n\n### Tiebreakers\n\nIn the event of a tie on points, the tiebreakers were used to determine the ranking of the teams. The tiebreakers were as follows:\n\n* Goal difference: The team with the higher goal difference was ranked higher.\n* Goals scored: The team that scored more goals was ranked higher.\n* Away goals scored: The team that scored more away goals was ranked higher.\n* Head-to-head record: The team that won the head-to-head match was ranked higher.\n\n**Groups**\n\nThe 46 teams were divided into 11 groups of four teams each. The teams played their home and away matches within each group, and the top two teams from each group advanced to the final round.\n\n### Group A\n\n| Team | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | GD | Pts |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  Australia | 6 | 4 | 2 | 0 | 12 | 3 | +9 | 14 |\n|  China | 6 | 4 | 1 | 1 | 10 | 5 | +5 | 13 |\n|  Philippines | 6 | 2 | 1 | 3 | 6 | 10 | -4 | 7 |\n|  Brunei | 6 | 0 | 0 | 6 | 2 | 13 | -11 | 0 |\n\n### Group B\n\n| Team | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | GD | Pts |\n|  Japan | 6 | 5 | 1 | 0 | 15 | 2 | +13 | 16 |\n|  South Korea | 6 | 4 | 1 | 1 | 12 | 5 | +7 | 13 |\n|  Mongolia | 6 | 2 | 0 | 4 | 7 | 14 | -7 | 6 |\n|  Guam | 6 | 0 | 0 | 6 | 2 | 16 | -14 | 0 |\n\n### Group C\n\n| Team | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | GD | Pts |\n|  Vietnam | 6 | 5 | 1 | 0 | 14 | 3 | +11 | 16 |\n|  Thailand | 6 | 4 | 1 | 1 | 14 | 6 | +8 | 13 |\n|  Cambodia | 6 | 1 | 1 | 4 | 5 | 14 | -9 | 4 |\n|  Laos | 6 | 0 | 1 | 5 | 2 | 13 | -11 | 1 |\n\n### Group D\n\n| Team | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | GD | Pts |\n|  Iran | 6 | 5 | 1 | 0 | 15 | 3 | +12 | 16 |\n|  Iraq | 6 | 4 | 1 | 1 | 13 | 6 | +7 | 13 |\n|  Bahrain | 6 | 2 | 1 | 3 | 6 | 12 | -6 | 7 |\n|  Yemen | 6 | 0 | 1 | 5 | 3 | 14 | -11 | 1 |\n\n### Group E\n\n| Team | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | GD | Pts |\n|  Saudi Arabia | 6 | 4 | 2 | 0 | 10 | 3 | +7 | 14 |\n|  United Arab Emirates | 6 | 4 | 1 | 1 | 11 | 4 | +7 | 13 |\n|  Jordan | 6 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 7 | 6 | +1 | 8 |\n|  Palestine | 6 | 0 | 1 | 5 | 0 | 12 | -12 | 1 |\n\n### Group F\n\n| Team | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | GD | Pts |\n|  Oman | 6 | 5 | 1 | 0 | 13 | 3 | +10 | 16 |\n|  Qatar | 6 | 4 | 1 | 1 | 12 | 5 | +7 | 13 |\n|  Kuwait | 6 | 2 | 1 | 3 | 8 | 9 | -1 | 7 |\n|  North Korea | 6 | 0 | 1 | 5 | 2 | 15 | -13 | 1 |\n\n### Group G\n\n| Team | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | GD | Pts |\n|  Lebanon | 6 | 4 | 2 | 0 | 9 | 1 | +8 | 14 |\n|  Syria | 6 | 4 | 1 | 1 | 8 | 3 | +5 | 13 |\n|  Turkmenistan | 6 | 2 | 0 | 4 | 5 | 8 | -3 | 6 |\n|  Bangladesh | 6 | 0 | 1 | 5 | 1 | 11 | -10 | 1 |\n\n### Group H\n\n| Team | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | GD | Pts |\n|  Uzbekistan | 6 | 5 | 1 | 0 | 14 | 3 | +11 | 16 |\n|  Tajikistan | 6 | 4 | 1 | 1 | 13 | 5 | +8 | 13 |\n|  Afghanistan | 6 | 2 | 0 | 4 | 8 | 13 | -5 | 6 |\n|  Maldives | 6 | 0 | 0 | 6 | 2 | 16 | -14 | 0 |\n\n### Group I\n\n| Team | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | GD | Pts |\n|  Singapore | 6 | 5 | 0 | 1 | 12 | 3 | +9 | 15 |\n|  Hong Kong | 6 | 4 | 1 | 1 | 12 | 4 | +8 | 13 |\n|  Macau | 6 | 2 | 1 | 3 | 8 | 10 | -2 | 7 |\n|  Bhutan | 6 | 0 | 0 | 6 | 0 | 18 | -18 | 0 |\n\n### Group J\n\n| Team | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | GD | Pts |\n|  Myanmar | 6 | 4 | 1 | 1 | 11 | 4 | +7 | 13 |\n|  Timor-Leste | 6 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 10 | 7 | +3 | 11 |\n|  Sri Lanka | 6 | 3 | 1 | 2 | 8 | 5 | +3 | 10 |\n|  Nepal | 6 | 0 | 0 | 6 | 1 | 14 | -13 | 0 |\n\n**Ranking of second-placed teams**\n\nThe second-placed teams from each group were ranked based on their points, goal difference, goals scored, away goals scored, and head-to-head record.
