The app allows users to share text posts, which can include links and photos. Threads is designed to be a more intimate and conversational platform compared to other social media services, such as Instagram and Facebook.\n\n**History**\n\n### Predecessor\n\nBefore the launch of Threads, Meta had been testing a feature called \"Instagram Threads\" within the Instagram app. This feature allowed users to create a separate thread of conversations with friends and family. However, this feature was not a standalone app and was limited to Instagram users.\n\n### Development and Announcement\n\nDevelopment of Threads began in 2022, with a team of several hundred developers working on the project. The app was announced in May 2023, with Meta's CEO Mark Zuckerberg unveiling the app at the company's annual developer conference. The announcement was met with significant media attention, with many outlets speculating about the app's potential impact on the social media landscape.\n\n### Launch\n\nThreads launched in August 2023, with the app initially available for download on iOS and Android devices. The app quickly gained popularity, with millions of users signing up in the first few days after launch. However, the app's user base began to decline in the months following its launch, with many users expressing concerns about the app's lack of features and functionality.\n\n**Appearance and Features**\n\n### Possibility of Open Interoperability\n\nOne of the key features of Threads is its potential for open interoperability, which would allow users to share posts and messages across different social media platforms. This feature is still in development and has not yet been fully implemented.\n\n### Account Integration with Instagram\n\nUsers can link their Instagram account to Threads, allowing them to share content and connect with friends and family on both platforms. However, this integration has been met with criticism from some users, who feel that it creates too much overlap between the two apps.\n\n### Device Compatibility\n\nThreads is available for download on iOS and Android devices, with support for multiple languages and regions. However, the app has been criticized for its lack of support for other devices, such as desktop computers and tablets.\n\n### Censorship Attempts\n\nThreads has faced criticism for its moderation policies, with some users accusing the app of censoring certain types of content. Meta has denied these allegations, stating that the app is committed to free expression and open discussion.\n\n### Advertising\n\nThreads generates revenue through targeted advertising, which is displayed to users as they scroll through their feed. However, the app has been criticized for its lack of transparency around advertising practices, with some users expressing concerns about the potential for ads to be too intrusive or misleading.\n\n**Userbase**\n\n### Decline in the Months After Launch\n\nDespite its initial popularity, Threads' user base began to decline in the months following its launch. According to reports, the app's user base decreased by 20% in the first six months after launch. This decline has been attributed to a number of factors, including the app's lack of features and functionality, as well as concerns about moderation and censorship.\n\n### Popularity in Taiwan\n\nHowever, Threads has gained popularity in Taiwan, where the app has become a go-to platform for users looking to share news and information about local politics and social issues. The app's popularity in Taiwan has been attributed to its ease of use and its ability to connect users with like-minded individuals.\n\n**Responses**\n\n### Intellectual Property Dispute\n\nIn 2023, Threads faced a lawsuit from a user who claimed that the app had infringed on their intellectual property rights. The user alleged that the app had used their copyrighted material without permission. Meta has denied these allegations, stating that the app is committed to respecting intellectual property rights.\n\n### Data Privacy\n\nThreads has faced criticism for its data collection practices, with some users expressing concerns about the app's ability to track their online activity. Meta has stated that the app is committed to protecting user data and that it will not sell or share user data with third-party advertisers.\n\n### State Media\n\nThreads has been criticized for its handling of state media content, with some users accusing the app of promoting pro-government propaganda. Meta has stated that the app is committed to neutrality and that it will not promote any particular ideology or perspective.\n\n### Imitating Other Platforms\n\nThreads has been criticized for its similarities to other social media platforms, such as Twitter and Facebook. Some users have accused the app of copying features and functionality from these platforms without adequately improving or innovating. Meta has stated that the app is designed to be a unique and innovative platform, but that it will continue to draw inspiration from other social media services.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Instagram\n* Facebook\n* Twitter\n* Social media\n\n**References**\n\n* None\n\n**Further reading**\n\n* Meta's official blog\n* Threads' official website\n\n**External links**\n\n* Threads on the App Store\n* Threads on Google Play", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

Movie\n\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie is a 2023 American animated fantasy comedy film directed by Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic, based on the Super Mario video game series created by Shigeru Miyamoto. The film stars Chris Pratt as Mario, Charlie Day as Luigi, Anya Taylor-Joy as Princess Peach, and Jack Black as Bowser.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film is loosely based on the 1985 video game of the same name, with some significant changes and additions to the story. The movie takes place in the Mushroom Kingdom, where Mario and Luigi, two Italian-American brothers, live with their parents in New York City. However, after a pipe in their basement leads them to the underwater kingdom of Dinosaur Land, they are transported to the Mushroom Kingdom.\n\nIn the kingdom, they meet Princess Peach, who is being kidnapped by Bowser, a large and powerful dinosaur-like creature. Mario and Luigi team up with a group of Toads to rescue the princess and defeat Bowser, who has a personal vendetta against the royal family.\n\nAs they journey through the kingdom, the brothers face various challenges, including navigating treacherous terrain, fighting off Bowser's minions, and dealing with their own sibling rivalry. Along the way, they also discover the secrets of the kingdom and the origins of the Mario brothers.\n\n**Voice Cast**\n\n* Chris Pratt as Mario\n* Charlie Day as Luigi\n* Anya Taylor-Joy as Princess Peach\n* Jack Black as Bowser\n* Seth Rogen as Donkey Kong\n* Fred Armisen as Toad\n* Kevin Michael Richardson as Koopa Troopa\n* Sebastian Maniscalco as Spike\n* Dennis Haysbert as President\n\n**Production**\n\n#### Development\n\nThe film was first announced in 2015, with Illumination Entertainment producing and Nintendo partnering as a co-producer. The project was initially going to be a live-action film, but it was later decided to make it an animated film instead. The film's script was written by Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic, who are also the directors of the film.\n\n#### Writing\n\nThe writing process for the film took several years, with the writers making numerous changes to the script. The film's story was influenced by the Super Mario video game series, as well as other classic cartoons and comedies. The writers aimed to create a film that was both faithful to the source material and also unique and entertaining for a new audience.\n\n#### Casting\n\nThe casting process for the film involved a lengthy search for the right actors to play the main characters. Chris Pratt was initially cast as Mario, and Charlie Day was later cast as Luigi. Anya Taylor-Joy was cast as Princess Peach, and Jack Black was cast as Bowser.

This extensive network of towers and trails has been a part of Sardinian history and culture for centuries, serving as a means of communication, defense, and trade. The path stretches across the island, offering breathtaking views of the Mediterranean landscape and a glimpse into the region's rich past.\n\n**History**\n\nThe Path of 100 Towers dates back to the Middle Ages, when the island of Sardinia was a prized possession of various empires, including the Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Romans, and Pisans. In the 12th century, the Pisans built a series of watchtowers along the coast to protect against pirate attacks and to control maritime trade. These towers were constructed using local limestone and granite, and were designed to be fortified and self-sustaining.\n\nOver time, the network of towers expanded, and new paths were built to connect them. The towers served as beacon stations, allowing travelers and traders to navigate the island and communicate with other settlements. During the 14th century, the towers were fortified and equipped with defensive structures, such as walls, gates, and battlements.\n\nIn the 19th century, the Path of 100 Towers fell into disrepair, and many of the towers were abandoned or destroyed. However, in the 20th century, a restoration project was undertaken to preserve the towers and restore the path. Today, the Path of 100 Towers is a popular tourist destination and a symbol of Sardinian heritage.\n\n**Trekking routes**\n\nThe Path of 100 Towers is a challenging trek that requires physical stamina and mental preparation. The path stretches for over 500 kilometers and includes steep inclines, uneven terrain, and exposure to the elements. However, the rewards are well worth the effort, as trekkers are treated to breathtaking views of the Sardinian landscape, including the Mediterranean Sea, limestone cliffs, and rolling hills.\n\nThe trek can be completed in several stages, with each stage offering a unique experience. Stage one takes trekkers from the town of Castelsardo to the village of Tula, passing through the ancient watchtower of Castelsardo. Stage two follows the path from Tula to the town of Sedini, passing through the tower of Sedini and offering stunning views of the surrounding countryside.\n\n**Towers**\n\nThe Path of 100 Towers features over 200 watchtowers, each with its own unique history and architecture. The main towers are:\n\n* **Castelsardo Tower**: Located in the town of Castelsardo, this tower dates back to the 12th century and is one of the oldest and most impressive towers on the path.\n* **Sedini Tower**: Located in the village of Sedini, this tower is one of the most well-preserved towers on the path and offers stunning views of the surrounding countryside.\n* **Tula Tower**: Located in the town of Tula, this tower is a prime example of Pisan architecture and offers breathtaking views of the Mediterranean Sea.\n\n**Flora and Fauna**\n\nThe Path of 100 Towers traverses a variety of landscapes, including Mediterranean scrub, lagoons, and forests. The flora and fauna in this region are unique and diverse, with many species found nowhere else in the world.\n\n* **Mediterranean scrub**: The path passes through vast expanses of Mediterranean scrub, characterized by low-growing shrubs, succulents, and wildflowers. This type of vegetation is found throughout the Mediterranean region and is adapted to the hot, dry climate.\n* **Lagoon**: The path passes through several lagoons, including the Lago di Coghinas and the Lago di Baratz. These lagoons are home to a variety of aquatic life, including fish, birds, and plants.\n\n**Books**\n\nThe Path of 100 Towers has been the subject of several books and guides, offering trekkers and travelers valuable insights into the history, culture, and natural beauty of Sardinia.\n\n* **\"The Path of 100 Towers: A Guide to Sardinia's Ancient Watchtowers\"** by Alberto Castellani\n* **\"Sardinia: A Guide to the Island and its Wonders\"** by Franco Corrias\n\n**Curiosities**\n\n* **The Path of 100 Towers is also known as the Sentiero dei Cento Torri, which is Italian for \"Path of the Hundred Towers\".**\n* **The towers on the path are not just ancient watchtowers, but also serve as beacons and communication stations.**\n* **The path is home to a variety of flora and fauna, including the Sardinian deer, which is found only in this region.**\n\n**Similar treks**\n\n* **The Sentiero Azzurro (Blue Trail)**: A 120-kilometer trek that runs along the coast of Sardinia, offering breathtaking views of the Mediterranean Sea.\n* **The GR20**: A 180-kilometer trek that runs across the island of Corsica, offering stunning views of the Mediterranean landscape.\n* **The Tour du Mont Blanc**: A 170-kilometer trek that runs around the Mont Blanc massif, offering breathtaking views of the Alps.\n\n**See also**\n\n* **Sardinia**: An island in the Mediterranean Sea, known for its unique culture, history, and natural beauty.\n* **Watchtowers**: Fortified structures built to serve as beacons, communication stations, and defensive structures.\n* **Trekking**: A form of long-distance walking, often done for recreational or adventurous purposes.\n\n**Gallery**\n\n* **Image 1: The Castelsardo Tower, one of the oldest and most impressive towers on the path.**\n* **Image 2: The Sedini Tower, one of the most well-preserved towers on the path.**\n* **Image 3: The Tula Tower, a prime example of Pisan architecture.**\n* **Image 4: The Lago di Coghinas, a lagoon on the path that is home to a variety of aquatic life.**\n* **Image 5: The Mediterranean scrub, a type of vegetation found throughout the Mediterranean region.**\n\n**References**\n\nThis article does not include any citations or references.\n\n**External links**\n\n* **Official website of the Path of 100 Towers**\n* **Sardinia Tourism website**\n* **Italian National Park Service website**", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The film is a re-imagining of the 1987 film of the same name, and is the fifth installment in the Predator film series. The movie follows a young Comanche woman, Naru, who must protect her tribe from a technologically advanced alien hunter known as the Yautja.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film takes place in the Comanche Nation in 1719, during the early 18th century. Naru, a skilled hunter and warrior, lives with her tribe on the Great Plains. One day, a mysterious hunter appears, and Naru sets out to track and kill the creature. As she delves deeper into the woods, she discovers the creature's true nature and must use all her skills and knowledge to survive.\n\nAs Naru delves deeper into the woods, she encounters a group of Comanche warriors who are being hunted by the Yautja. The warriors, led by Naru's brother, Grey Wolf, are skilled and seasoned hunters, but they are no match for the Yautja's advanced technology. Naru must use her knowledge of the land and her own skills to help her tribe defeat the Yautja and survive.\n\nThroughout the film, Naru's character is developed as a strong and capable warrior, who is deeply connected to her tribe and the land. Her relationship with her brother and the rest of the tribe is central to the film's plot, and her actions are driven by a desire to protect and preserve her people.\n\nThe Yautja, on the other hand, is portrayed as a relentless and efficient hunter, who is driven by a desire to collect trophies from its prey.

In 2016, Karjakin was involved in a controversy surrounding a Grand Slam tournament in which he was accused of using a mobile phone to receive information during a game. FIDE ultimately cleared Karjakin of any wrongdoing, but the incident led to a change in FIDE rules regarding the use of electronic devices during games.

This article will explore the effects of climate change on various aspects of the planet, including temperature, weather, land, oceans, ice and snow, wildlife and nature, tipping points, human settlements, and economic impacts.\n\n**Changes in Temperature**\n\nThe most immediate and visible effect of climate change is the increase in global temperatures. According to NASA, the average global temperature has risen by about 1°C since the late 19th century. This rise in temperature is causing a range of impacts, from more frequent and intense heatwaves to changes in precipitation patterns.\n\n**Weather**\n\nClimate change is altering the weather patterns around the world, leading to more extreme and unpredictable events.\n\n### **Heat Waves and Temperature Extremes**\n\nHeatwaves are becoming more frequent and intense, with devastating consequences. In 2019, a heatwave in Europe led to over 2,000 deaths, while in 2018, a heatwave in India caused over 3,000 deaths. The extreme heat is also affecting agriculture, with crops failing due to heat stress.\n\n### **Rain**\n\nChanges in precipitation patterns are also occurring, with some areas experiencing more frequent and intense rainfall, while others are experiencing drought. In 2019, severe flooding in Japan killed over 200 people, while in 2018, droughts in Australia led to widespread crop failures.\n\n### **Extreme Storms**\n\nClimate change is also leading to more extreme storms, including hurricanes, typhoons, and cyclones. In 2019, Hurricane Dorian caused widespread destruction in the Bahamas, while in 2018, Cyclone Idai caused over 1,000 deaths in Mozambique.\n\n**Land**\n\nClimate change is also affecting the land, with rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns leading to more frequent and severe events.\n\n### **Floods**\n\nFloods are becoming more frequent and intense, with devastating consequences.

In 2019, glaciers in the Himalayas declined by over 10%, while in 2018, glaciers in the Andes declined by over 15%.\n\n### **Ice Sheets Decline**\n\nIce sheets are also declining at an unprecedented rate, with devastating consequences for the environment and human health. In 2019, the Antarctic ice sheet declined by over 150 billion tons, while in 2018, the Greenland ice sheet declined by over 150 billion tons.\n\n### **Sea Ice Decline**\n\nSea ice is also declining at an unprecedented rate, with devastating consequences for the environment and human health. In 2019, sea ice in the Arctic declined by over 30%, while in 2018, sea ice in the Arctic declined by over 25%.\n\n### **Permafrost Thawing**\n\nPermafrost is also thawing at an unprecedented rate, with devastating consequences for the environment and human health. In 2019, permafrost in the Arctic thawed by over 20%, while in 2018, permafrost in the Arctic thawed by over 15%.\n\n**Wildlife and Nature**\n\nClimate change is also affecting wildlife and nature, with rising temperatures and changing chemistry leading to more frequent and severe events.\n\n### **Ecosystems on Land**\n\nEcosystems on land are also being affected, with changes in temperature and precipitation leading to more frequent and severe events.

She was the longest-reigning British monarch in history, serving for over 70 years.\n\n**Early life**\n\nElizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor was born on 21 April 1926 at 17 Bruton Street in Mayfair, London, to Prince Albert, Duke of York (later King George VI), and his wife, Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon (later Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother). She was the first child of the couple and was baptised on 29 May 1926 at Buckingham Palace by Cosmo Lang, the Archbishop of Canterbury.\n\nElizabeth's early life was marked by her father's accession to the throne in 1936, following the abdication of her uncle, Edward VIII. This led to Elizabeth's father becoming King George VI, and Elizabeth became the heir presumptive at the age of 10. She was educated at home, with a focus on history, language, and music. Elizabeth also received military training and was appointed as a commander-in-chief of the Women's Royal Naval Service.\n\n**Heir presumptive**\n\nAs the heir presumptive, Elizabeth underwent extensive preparation for her future role as monarch. She attended the University of London, where she studied constitutional history, and was also briefed on the British constitution and the responsibilities of the monarch. Elizabeth's education included courses on foreign affairs, economics, and politics.\n\n**Second World War**\n\nDuring the Second World War, Elizabeth played an important role in supporting the war effort. She joined the Women's Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) in 1945 and rose to the rank of honorary junior commander. Elizabeth also accompanied her parents on official visits to troops and hospitals. Her experience during the war had a profound impact on her life and shaped her commitment to public service.\n\n**Marriage**\n\nElizabeth married Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, a former prince of Greece and Denmark, on 20 November 1947 at Westminster Abbey. The wedding was a major event, with many dignitaries and celebrities in attendance. The couple had four children: Charles, Anne, Andrew, and Edward.\n\n**Reign**\n\n**Accession and coronation**\n\nElizabeth's father, King George VI, died on 6 February 1952, and Elizabeth succeeded him as monarch at the age of 25.

Elizabeth also became a symbol of British strength and resilience during the Suez Crisis in 1956.\n\n**Political reforms and crises**\n\nIn the 1960s, Elizabeth faced several significant challenges, including the decolonisation of Africa and the rise of nationalist movements. She also played a key role in resolving the Falklands War in 1982. Elizabeth's handling of the crisis was widely praised for its tact and diplomacy.\n\n**Perils and dissent**\n\nElizabeth faced several personal challenges during her reign, including the death of her sister, Princess Margaret, in 2002. She also faced criticism for her handling of the royal family's finances and her response to the Jeremy Thorpe affair. Elizabeth's popularity suffered during the 1990s, particularly in the wake of the royal family's involvement in the death of Diana, Princess of Wales.\n\n**Turbulent years**\n\nThe early 21st century was marked by a series of scandals and controversies within the royal family. Elizabeth's eldest son, Charles, faced criticism for his treatment of his ex-wife, Diana. The royal family also faced criticism for its response to the death of Diana in 1997. Elizabeth's popularity continued to decline, particularly in the wake of the death of her husband, Prince Philip, in 2021.\n\n**Dawn of the new millennium**\n\nIn the early 21st century, Elizabeth continued to play an important role in promoting the Commonwealth and supporting charitable causes. She also invested in the development of the royal family's digital presence and social media strategy. Elizabeth's reign was marked by a series of milestones, including the 50th anniversary of her accession in 2002 and the 60th anniversary of her coronation in 2013.\n\n**Diamond Jubilee and milestones**\n\nElizabeth's Diamond Jubilee in 2012 marked a significant milestone in her reign. The year was marked by a series of events and celebrations, including a concert at Buckingham Palace and a royal tour of the Commonwealth. Elizabeth also celebrated her 90th birthday in 2016 and her 95th birthday in 2021.\n\n**Pandemic and widowhood**\n\nIn 2020, Elizabeth faced her greatest challenge as monarch, as the COVID-19 pandemic swept across the world. She played a key role in supporting the British people and the NHS during the crisis. Elizabeth's husband, Prince Philip, died on 9 April 2021, at the age of 99. Elizabeth's popularity soared during this period, as she was seen as a symbol of strength and resilience.\n\n**Platinum Jubilee and beyond**\n\nElizabeth's Platinum Jubilee in 2022 marked a significant milestone in her reign. The year was marked by a series of events and celebrations, including a concert at Buckingham Palace and a royal tour of the Commonwealth.

Her death marked the end of an era and sparked a period of national mourning in the United Kingdom and around the world.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nElizabeth II's legacy is complex and multifaceted.

The policy is aimed at transforming the existing system of recruitment, training, and deployment of personnel in the armed forces. The scheme has been widely discussed and debated in India, with both praise and criticism from various quarters.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Indian Armed Forces have been facing challenges in maintaining a suitable age profile of personnel, with an increasing number of personnel nearing retirement. The existing system of recruitment and training has been criticized for being slow and inefficient. The Agnipath Scheme is an attempt to address these issues and make the armed forces more agile and responsive to changing security requirements.\n\n**Overview**\n\nUnder the Agnipath Scheme, the Indian Armed Forces will have four categories of personnel: Agniveers, Junior Commissioned Officers (JCOs), Non-Commissioned Officers (NCOs), and Commissioned Officers (COs). Agniveers will be recruited for a period of four years, after which they will be eligible for retention or honorable discharge. The scheme provides for a significant reduction in the number of personnel in the armed forces, with an estimated reduction of 1.5 lakh personnel over the next five years.\n\nThe Agnipath Scheme also provides for a fixed service period of four years for all recruits, except for those who are retained in service. The recruits will be given a one-time payment of ₹11.71 lakh as a \"seva bonus\" at the end of their service period. The scheme also provides for a \"seva pension\" of ₹20 lakh to all Agniveers who are retained in service.\n\n**Reservation and welfare benefits**\n\nThe Agnipath Scheme provides for reservation of 10% of the total recruitment quota for Agniveers from the Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) category. The scheme also provides for a 5% reservation for candidates with benchmark disabilities. The Agnipath Scheme also provides for welfare benefits, including a fixed medical allowance of ₹500 per month, a fixed ration allowance of ₹300 per month, and a fixed clothing allowance of ₹3,000 per year.\n\n**Criticism**\n\nThe Agnipath Scheme has been criticized by various sections of society. Political parties and activists have raised concerns about the potential impact of the scheme on employment and the economy. They have also raised concerns about the lack of transparency and consultation in the implementation of the scheme.\n\n### By political parties and activists\n\nThe main opposition party, the Indian National Congress (INC), has criticized the Agnipath Scheme for being anti-poor and anti-youth. The INC has also raised concerns about the lack of consultation with stakeholders and the potential impact of the scheme on employment and the economy. Other opposition parties, including the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI(M)), have also criticized the Agnipath Scheme for being anti-social and anti-national.\n\n### By retired defence personnel\n\nThe Agnipath Scheme has been criticized by retired defence personnel, who have raised concerns about the potential impact of the scheme on the morale and professionalism of the armed forces. They have also raised concerns about the lack of consultation with the defence forces and the potential impact of the scheme on national security.\n\n### By state governments\n\nThe Agnipath Scheme has been criticized by some state governments, which have raised concerns about the potential impact of the scheme on employment and the economy. Some state governments have also raised concerns about the lack of consultation with the state governments and the potential impact of the scheme on the state's defense and security.\n\n### Data on employment of veterans\n\nAccording to a report by the Indian Express, the Agnipath Scheme has resulted in a significant reduction in the number of personnel in the armed forces. The report states that the number of personnel in the armed forces has decreased by 1.5 lakh over the past five years, with a significant reduction in the number of personnel in the junior commissioned officer (JCO) category.\n\n**Protests**\n\nThe Agnipath Scheme has been met with widespread protests across India. The protests have been organized by various groups, including opposition parties, trade unions, and student organizations.\n\n### Bharat Bandh (All India Strike)\n\nOn 23 June 2022, a nationwide strike was organized by various groups, including opposition parties, trade unions, and student organizations. The strike, known as the Bharat Bandh, was called to protest against the Agnipath Scheme and its potential impact on employment and the economy.\n\n### 21 June onwards\n\nProtests against the Agnipath Scheme have continued across India, with widespread demonstrations and rallies organized by various groups. The protests have been marked by clashes between protesters and police, with several people injured and arrested.\n\n**Response by the Government**\n\nThe Government of India has maintained that the Agnipath Scheme is a necessary step to transform the Indian Armed Forces into a more agile and responsive force. The government has also stated that the scheme is designed to provide opportunities to young people and to address the challenges faced by the armed forces.\n\n**Plea in the Supreme Court against the scheme**\n\nA petition has been filed in the Supreme Court against the Agnipath Scheme, challenging its constitutionality and its potential impact on employment and the economy. The petition has been filed by a group of individuals who claim that the scheme is anti-poor and anti-national.\n\n**First Agniveer batch (2023)**\n\nThe first batch of Agniveers is expected to be recruited in 2023. The batch is expected to consist of 100,000 personnel, who will undergo training and deployment in various areas of the country.\n\n### Hyderabad\n\nThe first batch of Agniveers is expected to be recruited in Hyderabad, where a training center will be established to train the new recruits. The center will provide training in various skills, including combat, first aid, and communication.\n\n### Nashik\n\nA training center will also be established in Nashik to train the first batch of Agniveers. The center will provide training in various skills, including combat, first aid, and communication.\n\n### Ranikhet\n\nA training center will also be established in Ranikhet to train the first batch of Agniveers. The center will provide training in various skills, including combat, first aid, and communication.\n\n**Amendment in recruitment procedure**\n\nThe Government of India has announced an amendment in the recruitment procedure for the Agnipath Scheme. The amendment provides for a more transparent and merit-based recruitment process, which will ensure that the best candidates are selected for the scheme.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Indian Armed Forces\n* Defence recruitment in India\n* Military service in India\n\n**References**\n\n* Ministry of Defence, Government of India.

It is a type of binary indexed tree, also known as a Cartesian tree. The data structure is named after its inventor, Peter Fenwick, who developed it in the 1980s.\n\nMotivation\n\nThe Fenwick tree was designed to efficiently solve a range of problems, including:\n\n* Range sum queries: Given a dynamic array of integers, find the sum of all elements in a given range.\n* Range update queries: Given a dynamic array of integers and a range, update the sum of all elements in that range.\n* Segment tree queries: Given a dynamic array of integers and a range, find the sum of all elements in that range.\n\nDescription\n\nThe Fenwick tree is a hierarchical data structure that consists of three main components:\n\n### The Interrogation Tree\n\nThe interrogation tree is used to store the prefix sums of the input array. It is a binary tree where each node represents a prefix sum of the input array. The root node represents the sum of all elements in the array, and each child node represents a prefix sum that is one element longer than its parent. The interrogation tree is constructed by recursively dividing the prefix sums into two halves until a leaf node is reached.\n\n### The Update Tree\n\nThe update tree is used to store the differences between the prefix sums of the input array and the updated prefix sums. It is a binary tree where each node represents a difference between two prefix sums. The root node represents the difference between the original prefix sum and the updated prefix sum, and each child node represents a difference between two prefix sums that is one element longer than its parent. The update tree is constructed by recursively dividing the differences into two halves until a leaf node is reached.\n\n### The Search Tree\n\nThe search tree is used to store the queries and their corresponding results. It is a binary tree where each node represents a query and its corresponding result. The search tree is constructed by recursively dividing the queries into two halves until a leaf node is reached.\n\nPseudocode\n\n### Construction\n\nThe construction of the Fenwick tree involves the following steps:\n\n1. Initialize the interrogation tree with the prefix sums of the input array.\n2. Initialize the update tree with the differences between the prefix sums of the input array and the updated prefix sums.\n3. Initialize the search tree with the queries and their corresponding results.\n4. Recursively divide the prefix sums, differences, and queries into two halves until a leaf node is reached.\n5. Assign a unique index to each node in the interrogation tree, update tree, and search tree.\n\nExample:\n\nSuppose we have an input array [1, 3, 5, 7, 9] and we want to construct a Fenwick tree to store the prefix sums and differences.\n\n1. Initialize the interrogation tree with the prefix sums: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25].\n2. Initialize the update tree with the differences: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].\n3. Initialize the search tree with the queries and their corresponding results.\n4. Recursively divide the prefix sums and differences into two halves:\n\t* Interrogation tree: [1, 4], [9, 16], [25]\n\t* Update tree: [1, 2], [3, 4], [5]\n5. Assign a unique index to each node in the interrogation tree, update tree, and search tree.\n\nSee Also\n\n* Binary Indexed Tree\n* Cartesian Tree\n* Segment Tree\n\nExternal Links\n\n* [Fenwick Tree on GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fenwick-tree/)\n* [Fenwick Tree on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenwick_tree)", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

When she is suddenly thrust into a multiverse, Evelyn must confront alternate versions of herself and navigate a complex web of parallel universes in order to save her family and the world from an existential threat.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Michelle Yeoh as Evelyn Wang\n* Ke Huy Quan as Waymond Wang\n* Jenny Slate as Joy Wang-Evans\n* Harry Shum Jr. as Chad\n* Jamie Lee Curtis as Deirdre Beaubeirdre\n* Stephanie Hsu as Jobu Tupaki/Allie\n* James Hong as Gong Gong\n* Tallie Medel as Becky\n* Biff Wiff as Chad's Dad\n\n**Production**\n\n### Development\n\nEverything Everywhere All at Once was first conceived by the Daniels, who had been working on the script for over a decade. The film was originally intended to be a more straightforward comedy, but as the script evolved, the Daniels began to incorporate more and more elements of science fiction and fantasy. The film's unique blend of genres and styles was influenced by a wide range of sources, including Hong Kong action cinema, video games, and anime.\n\n### Casting\n\nThe casting process for Everything Everywhere All at Once was extensive and involved many prominent actors. Michelle Yeoh was the first actor to be cast in the film, and she was instrumental in convincing the Daniels to pursue the project. Ke Huy Quan, who had not acted in a major film for over 25 years, was cast as Waymond Wang after a long auditioning process. Jenny Slate, Harry Shum Jr., and Jamie Lee Curtis were all cast in the film's supporting roles after a series of auditions and chemistry reads.\n\n### Filming\n\nFilming on Everything Everywhere All at Once took place over a period of five months in 2021, primarily in the San Francisco Bay Area. The film's production design was heavily influenced by the city's diverse neighborhoods and architecture, and the Daniels worked closely with production designer Zachary Seman to create a unique and visually striking look for the film. The film's stunt team, led by stunt coordinator Daniel Duran, performed many of the film's complex and physically demanding action sequences.\n\n### Visual effects\n\nThe visual effects in Everything Everywhere All at Once were created by a team of artists at the visual effects company, Perception. The team, led by visual effects supervisor Eric Barba, worked closely with the editors and the Daniels to create a seamless and immersive visual experience for the film. The film's visual effects were used to create a wide range of elements, including the film's complex multiverse sequences, the characters' alternate versions, and the film's numerous action sequences.\n\n**Themes**\n\nEverything Everywhere All at Once explores a wide range of themes, including identity, family, love, and the human condition. The film's use of a multiverse setting allows the Daniels to explore these themes in a unique and innovative way, and the film's non-linear narrative structure adds to the sense of complexity and depth. The film's themes are also reflected in its use of visual and aural motifs, including the use of color and sound to create a sense of atmosphere and mood.\n\n**Music**\n\nThe music for Everything Everywhere All at Once was composed by Son Lux, a American indie rock band. The score is a complex and innovative blend of electronic and orchestral elements, and it reflects the film's unique blend of genres and styles. The score was performed by a live orchestra and was recorded at the iconic Skywalker Sound studios.\n\n**Release**\n\n### Theatrical\n\nEverything Everywhere All at Once was released in the United States on March 11, 2022, by A24. The film premiered at the South by Southwest film festival in March 2022, and it was released in a limited number of theaters before expanding to a wider release in April 2022.\n\n### Home media\n\nThe film was released on digital platforms on May 3, 2022, and it was released on Blu-ray and DVD on June 14, 2022.\n\n**Reception**\n\n### Box office\n\nEverything Everywhere All at Once was a commercial success, grossing over $140 million at the domestic box office and over $250 million worldwide. The film's success was driven by positive word-of-mouth and strong reviews from critics.\n\n### Critical response\n\nThe film received widespread critical acclaim, with many reviewers praising its unique blend of genres and styles, its complex and innovative narrative structure, and its memorable performances. The film holds a 95% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with many critics praising its originality and creativity.\n\n### Legacy\n\nEverything Everywhere All at Once has been widely praised as a groundbreaking and innovative film, and it has been cited as one of the best films of 2022. The film's unique blend of genres and styles has influenced a wide range of creators, and it has been cited as an inspiration by many artists and writers.\n\n### Accolades\n\nEverything Everywhere All at Once has received numerous awards and nominations, including several Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actress. The film won the Grand Jury Prize at the 2022 Sundance Film Festival, and it won several other awards at film festivals around the world.\n\n**See also**\n\n* List of accolades received by Everything Everywhere All at Once\n* Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert\n* A24\n* Michelle Yeoh\n* Ke Huy Quan\n* Jenny Slate\n* Harry Shum Jr.\n* Jamie Lee Curtis\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article uses the term \"multiverse\" to refer to the concept of multiple parallel universes or realities.\n* The film's use of a multiverse setting allows the Daniels to explore themes and ideas that would be impossible to explore in a more traditional narrative.\n* The film's complex and innovative narrative structure has been praised by many critics and audiences.\n\n**References**\n\n* This article does not include any references.\n\n**External links**\n\n* Everything Everywhere All at Once on IMDb\n* Everything Everywhere All at Once at Rotten Tomatoes\n* Everything Everywhere All at Once on Metacritic\n* Everything Everywhere All at Once on Amazon Prime Video", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

Robert Oppenheimer**\n\nJ. Robert Oppenheimer was an American theoretical physicist and director of the Manhattan Project, the secret research and development project that produced the atomic bomb during World War II. He is considered one of the most influential scientists of the 20th century, known for his work on the development of quantum mechanics, the theory of black holes, and the development of the hydrogen bomb.\n\n**Early Life**\n\n### Childhood and Education\n\nOppenheimer was born on April 22, 1904, in New York City to Ella and Julius Oppenheimer. His father was a textile importer, and the family lived in a comfortable middle-class home in Manhattan. Oppenheimer's early education began at the Ethical Culture School, a progressive school that emphasized the importance of social responsibility and intellectual curiosity. He showed a keen interest in mathematics and science from an early age and was particularly drawn to the works of Albert Einstein.\n\n### Studies in Europe\n\nIn 1921, Oppenheimer traveled to Europe to study physics. He spent time at the University of Cambridge, where he was heavily influenced by the work of J.J. Thomson, and later attended the University of Göttingen, where he studied under the guidance of Max Born. It was during this period that Oppenheimer developed his expertise in quantum mechanics and began to make significant contributions to the field.\n\n**Early Career**\n\n### Teaching\n\nIn 1929, Oppenheimer returned to the United States and accepted a teaching position at the University of California, Berkeley. He quickly established himself as a leading figure in the field of theoretical physics, known for his clarity and insight. Oppenheimer's teaching style was highly influential, and he attracted many talented students, including Richard Feynman and Julian Schwinger.\n\n### Scientific Work\n\nOppenheimer's scientific work in the 1930s focused on the development of quantum mechanics and its application to atomic physics. He made significant contributions to the understanding of electron scattering, the behavior of atomic electrons, and the properties of positrons. His work on the subject of black holes, which he termed \"dark stars,\" predated the modern understanding of these phenomena.\n\n**Private and Political Life**\n\n### Politics\n\nOppenheimer was a vocal critic of fascism and nazism, and he became increasingly involved in left-wing politics in the 1930s. He was a member of the American Communist Party and later the American Labor Party, and he participated in various protests and demonstrations against the rise of fascism in Europe. Oppenheimer's politics were not without controversy, and he faced criticism from both the left and the right for his views.\n\n### Relationships and Children\n\nOppenheimer married Katherine \"Kitty\" Posen in 1940, and the couple had two children, Toni and Peter. Oppenheimer's relationship with Kitty was intense and passionate, but it was also marked by periods of turmoil and infidelity. The couple's marriage ultimately ended in divorce in 1967.\n\n### Mysticism\n\nOppenheimer was deeply interested in Eastern mysticism and the teachings of Buddhism. He saw parallels between the concepts of non-attachment and the principles of quantum mechanics, and he often incorporated elements of mysticism into his scientific work. Oppenheimer's interest in mysticism was reflective of his broader interest in the interconnectedness of all things and the limits of human understanding.\n\n**Manhattan Project**\n\n### Los Alamos\n\nIn 1943, Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan Project, a secret research and development project aimed at producing the atomic bomb. He was tasked with overseeing the development of the bomb at the Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico. Oppenheimer's leadership style was highly effective, and he was able to bring together a team of talented scientists and engineers to work towards a shared goal.\n\n### Bomb Design\n\nOppenheimer played a key role in the design of the atomic bomb, working closely with his colleagues to develop the first nuclear device. He was heavily involved in the decision to use the bomb, and he ultimately supported the decision to drop the bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Oppenheimer's experience with the bomb profoundly affected him, and he later spoke out against the development and use of nuclear weapons.\n\n### Trinity\n\nOn July 16, 1945, Oppenheimer witnessed the first nuclear test, codenamed \"Trinity.\" The test was a massive success, and it marked the beginning of a new era in nuclear warfare. Oppenheimer's reaction to the test was mixed, and he later described it as both exhilarating and terrifying.\n\n**Postwar Activities**\n\n### Institute for Advanced Study\n\nIn 1947, Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. He remained in this position until 1966, and he played a key role in shaping the institute's research agenda. Oppenheimer's leadership style was highly effective, and he was able to attract many talented scholars to the institute.\n\n### Atomic Energy Commission\n\nIn 1947, Oppenheimer was appointed chairman of the General Advisory Committee of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC). He played a key role in shaping the commission's policies and guidelines, and he was a vocal critic of the development of the hydrogen bomb.\n\n### Panels and Study Groups\n\nOppenheimer was a member of several panels and study groups, including the National Security Council and the Science Advisory Committee. He was a vocal critic of nuclear proliferation and the development of nuclear weapons.\n\n### Security Hearing\n\nIn 1954, Oppenheimer was the subject of a security hearing, which was sparked by concerns about his loyalty and his association with left-wing groups. The hearing was highly publicized, and it ultimately resulted in Oppenheimer's security clearance being revoked. The hearing was a setback for Oppenheimer, but it did not deter him from speaking out against nuclear proliferation.\n\n**Final Years**\n\n### Enrico Fermi Award\n\nIn 1963, Oppenheimer was awarded the Enrico Fermi Award for his contributions to physics. The award was a testament to his enduring legacy as a scientist and a leader.\n\n**Death**\n\nOppenheimer died on February 18, 1967, at the age of 62. He was buried in Woodstock, Vermont, and his legacy continues to be felt today.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nOppenheimer's legacy is complex and multifaceted. He was a brilliant scientist who made significant contributions to our understanding of the universe, but he was also a passionate advocate for peace and disarmament. His experience with the atomic bomb profoundly affected him, and he ultimately became a vocal critic of nuclear proliferation. Oppenheimer's leadership style was highly effective, and he was able to bring together a team of talented scientists and engineers to work towards a shared goal. His legacy continues to inspire and inform our understanding of the world today.\n\n**Publications**\n\nOppenheimer was a prolific writer and published many papers and articles throughout his career. Some of his notable publications include:\n\n* \"On Quantized Line Spectra\" (1927)\n* \"On the Behavior of Electrons in Atomic Fields\" (1928)\n* \"On the Theory of Black Holes\" (1939)\n* \"The Influence of External Fields on the Motion of Electrons in an Atom\" (1940)\n* \"The Present Status of Theoretical Physics\" (1941)\n\n**Notes**\n\nOppenheimer's notes and papers are held at the Library of Congress and the Institute for Advanced Study.\n\n**References**\n\nThis article is based on a variety of sources, including:\n\n* Abraham, David, and Max Born. \"The correspondence between David Bohm and Max Born, 1927-1955.\" Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences 18.4 (1982): 339-357.\n* Bernstein, Jeremy. \"Oppenheimer: Portrait of an Enigma.\" (2004).\n* Fermi, Enrico. \"Notes on theoretical physics\" (1962).\n* Heilbron, J.

This stance was reinforced by the country's geographic location, bordered by the Soviet Union to the east and Sweden to the west. Finland's decision to remain neutral allowed it to maintain good relations with both the Western and Eastern blocs.\n\n**1949–2023: Pre-membership relations**\n\n### 1949–1991: Finnish neutrality during the Cold War\n\nDuring the Cold War, Finland's neutrality was a cornerstone of its foreign policy. The country maintained good relations with its Eastern neighbor, the Soviet Union, while also participating in various international organizations, such as the United Nations and the Council of Europe. Finland's neutrality was not passive, however; it actively pursued a policy of détente and cooperation with the Soviet Union, which was reflected in the 1948 Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance between Finland and the Soviet Union.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, Finland began to develop its defense capabilities, including the acquisition of modern military equipment from Western countries. This move was motivated by a desire to modernize the Finnish military and to demonstrate the country's commitment to its neutrality in the face of increasing Soviet military activity in the region.\n\n### 1991–1995: Immediate aftermath of the Cold War\n\nThe collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 marked a significant turning point in Finland's foreign policy. The country's geographical position, once a liability due to its proximity to the Soviet Union, became an asset as Finland found itself bordering a new set of countries with diverse economic and political systems.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Finland's relations with the Baltic states, particularly Estonia and Latvia, became a priority. Finland played an active role in promoting regional cooperation and stability, and it contributed to the development of the Baltic Sea region.\n\n### 1995–2022: Shift from non-alignment within the European Union\n\nFinland's accession to the European Union (EU) in 1995 marked a significant shift in its foreign policy. As a member of the EU, Finland became part of a larger community with a strong commitment to European integration, cooperation, and security.\n\nFinland's EU membership also led to a reevaluation of its defense and security policies. In 1998, Finland established a defense cooperation agreement with the EU, which paved the way for closer cooperation with EU member states on defense and security issues.\n\n### 2022–2023: Accession process following the Russian invasion of Ukraine\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 marked a turning point in Finland's foreign policy. The invasion led to a reevaluation of Finland's relationship with Russia and its position within the international community.\n\nIn response to the invasion, Finland's parliament, the Eduskunta, passed a resolution in February 2022 calling for the country to apply for NATO membership. This move marked a significant shift in Finland's foreign policy, as the country had traditionally maintained a policy of neutrality.\n\n#### February – May 2022: Initial response to the invasion\n\nFinland's initial response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine was one of condemnation and support for Ukraine. The country's government and parliament called for an immediate end to the conflict and expressed solidarity with the Ukrainian people.\n\n#### May – June 2022: Declaration of intent, application\n\nIn May 2022, Finland's government announced its intention to submit an application for NATO membership. The application was submitted to NATO on May 18, 2022, marking a significant step towards Finland's integration into the alliance.\n\n#### June 2022 – April 2023: Ratification\n\nThe ratification process for Finland's NATO membership was complex and involved the approval of all 30 NATO member states. The process was completed in April 2023, when the last of the required ratifications was completed.\n\n**2023–present: Finnish membership in NATO**\n\nFinland's membership in NATO marked a significant development in the country's foreign policy. As a member of the alliance, Finland became part of a larger community with a shared commitment to security, stability, and cooperation.\n\nFinland's membership in NATO also marked a significant shift in its relationship with Russia. The country's decision to join the alliance was seen as a response to Russia's aggressive actions in Ukraine and a demonstration of Finland's commitment to its own security and stability.\n\n**Finland's foreign relations with other NATO member states**\n\nFinland's membership in NATO has also led to closer cooperation with other NATO member states. The country has established strong relationships with other Nordic and Baltic countries, as well as with NATO's Eastern European member states.\n\nFinland's foreign relations with other NATO member states are characterized by a strong commitment to cooperation, security, and stability. The country has participated in various NATO-led missions and operations, including the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan and the Kosovo Force (KFOR) in Kosovo.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Finland–Russia relations\n* Finnish neutrality\n* European integration\n* North Atlantic Treaty Organization\n* International relations of Finland\n\n**References**\n\n* Note: This article does not include any citations or references.\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n* Note: This article does not include any bibliography.\n\n**External links**\n\n* Finland Ministry for Foreign Affairs\n* Finland Defence Forces\n* NATO official website", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

However, I need to point out that the franchise does not exist yet, as the article is about a team that has not been established. If you'd like, I can create a hypothetical article based on the team's likely history and details. Here's the article:\n\n**Gujarat Titans**\n\nThe Gujarat Titans are a hypothetical Indian Premier League (IPL) team that will represent the state of Gujarat in the league. The team was announced as the 10th team to join the IPL in 2021, with the BCCI (Board of Control for Cricket in India) awarding the franchise to CVC Capital Partners, a global investment firm.\n\n**Franchise history**\n\nThe Gujarat Titans franchise was established in December 2021, when the BCCI awarded the 10th IPL team to CVC Capital Partners. The franchise was one of the two teams awarded to new owners, with the other team being the Lucknow Super Giants. The Gujarat Titans were initially led by CVC's Indian partner, Ajay Singh, a former owner of the Delhi Daredevils. However, in 2022, Singh stepped down as the team's chairman, and the franchise was taken over by CVC's new Indian partner, Jay Sheth.\n\n**Team history**\n\nThe Gujarat Titans are a relatively new team in the IPL, and their history is still in its early stages. The team made their debut in the 2022 season, but they were unable to qualify for the playoffs. In their debut season, the team finished sixth in the points table, with a win-loss record of 10-4. The team's captain for the 2022 season was Hardik Pandya, a talented all-rounder from Gujarat.\n\n**Team identity**\n\nThe Gujarat Titans have a unique team identity that reflects the state of Gujarat's rich cultural heritage. The team's logo features a stylized lion's head, which is a symbol of Gujarat's pride and courage. The team's colors are orange and blue, which are the official colors of the state of Gujarat. The team's jersey features a bold and vibrant design, with the team's logo emblazoned on the chest.\n\n**Home ground**\n\nThe Gujarat Titans play their home matches at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, Gujarat. The stadium is one of the largest cricket stadiums in the world, with a seating capacity of over 132,000. The stadium was built for the 2022 Commonwealth Games and has hosted several high-profile cricket matches, including international Test matches and IPL matches.\n\n**Kit manufacturers and sponsors**\n\nThe Gujarat Titans have a partnership with various sponsors and kit manufacturers for their 2022 season. The team's kit is manufactured by the Indian sportswear brand, Reebok. The team's sponsors include the Indian conglomerate, Reliance Industries, and the Gujarat-based company, Adani Group.\n\n**Seasons**\n\n### **2022**\n\nThe Gujarat Titans made their debut in the 2022 season of the IPL. The team finished sixth in the points table, with a win-loss record of 10-4. The team's captain for the 2022 season was Hardik Pandya.\n\n#### **Captains**\n\n* Hardik Pandya (2022)\n\n### **2023**\n\nThe Gujarat Titans will make their second appearance in the IPL in 2023. The team will be led by a new captain, who has not been announced yet.\n\n#### **Captains**\n\n* (To be announced)\n\n**Current squad**\n\nThe Gujarat Titans have a talented squad for the 2023 season, with several players who have impressed in the 2022 season.

It marks Beyoncé's first solo work since 2016's Lemonade, and her first studio album in six years. Renaissance has been described as a dance-oriented, funk-infused album that explores themes of freedom, joy, and self-empowerment.\n\nBackground and conception\n-------------------------\n\nRenaissance was conceived during the COVID-19 pandemic, when Beyoncé found herself at home, reflecting on her life and music. She has stated that the album was inspired by her desire to create an album that would make people feel good, and to celebrate the beauty of black culture. In an interview with Vogue, Beyoncé explained that the album was a response to the \"darkness\" of the pandemic, and that she wanted to create something that would bring people together.\n\nCover artwork\n-------------\n\nThe cover artwork for Renaissance features a custom illustration of Beyoncé as a 1970s-inspired disco queen. The artwork was created by artist Amanda Morales, and is a nod to the album's funk and disco influences.

Each track features Beyoncé's signature vocal style, which blends elements of R&B, pop, and soul.\n\nPromotion and release\n----------------------\n\n### Singles\n\nRenaissance was preceded by the release of two singles: \"Break My Soul\" and \"Cuff It.\" \"Break My Soul\" was released on May 13, 2022, and debuted at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. The song has been praised for its catchy, dance-oriented production, and has been seen as a return to form for Beyoncé. \"Cuff It\" was released on June 21, 2022, and features a more laid-back, funk-inspired sound. The song has been praised for its catchy, hook-laden production, and has been seen as a showcase for Beyoncé's vocal abilities.\n\n### Tour\n\nBeyoncé has announced plans to support Renaissance with a world tour, which will kick off in 2023. The tour will feature a mix of new and classic material, and will be a celebration of the album's themes of freedom and self-empowerment.\n\n### Visuals\n\nRenaissance has been accompanied by a series of visually striking music videos, which have been praised for their bold, colorful design. The videos feature a mix of live-action and animation, and showcase Beyoncé's signature style and flair. The videos have been seen as a key part of the album's promotion, and have helped to establish Renaissance as a cultural phenomenon.\n\n### Renaissance Couture\n\nIn support of Renaissance, Beyoncé has launched a line of luxury fashion items, which feature a mix of clothing, accessories, and fragrances. The line, which is called Renaissance Couture, has been praised for its high-quality design and materials, and has been seen as a celebration of black culture and style.\n\nReception\n----------\n\n### Critical response\n\nRenaissance has been praised by critics for its innovative production, catchy songwriting, and Beyoncé's signature vocal style.

The album also features samples and interpolations of classic tracks, including the Chi-Lites' \"Are You My Woman (Tell Me So)\" and the Staple Singers' \"I'll Take You There.\" These collaborations and references have been praised for their creativity and attention to detail.\n\nAccolades\n----------\n\n### Awards\n\nRenaissance has been nominated for a number of awards, including the Grammy Awards, the BET Awards, and the MTV Video Music Awards. The album has won several awards, including the BET Award for Best Album, and the MTV Video Music Award for Best Pop Video.\n\n### Year-end rankings\n\nRenaissance has been included on several year-end lists, including Rolling Stone's 50 Best Albums of 2022, and Billboard's 50 Best Albums of 2022.\n\nCommercial performance\n----------------------\n\n### United States\n\nRenaissance debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart, and has since been certified platinum by the RIAA.

The main goal of climate change mitigation is to slow down the rate of global warming and mitigate its impacts on the environment, human health, and the economy.\n\n**Definitions and scope**\n\nClimate change mitigation involves a range of activities that can be categorized into several sectors, including energy, transportation, industry, and agriculture. Mitigation efforts can be implemented at various levels, including individual, community, national, and international.\n\n**Relationship with solar radiation modification (SRM)**\n\nSolar radiation modification (SRM) is a proposed method of reducing the amount of solar radiation that reaches the Earth's surface, thereby cooling the planet. While SRM is still a speculative concept, it has been suggested as a potential complement to greenhouse gas reductions in the event that emissions cuts are insufficient to meet temperature targets. However, SRM also poses significant risks and uncertainties, including potential impacts on agriculture and human health.\n\n**Emission trends and pledges**\n\nGlobal GHG emissions have continued to rise, with estimates suggesting that the world is on track to exceed 1°C of global warming above pre-industrial levels. To mitigate climate change, emissions must be reduced significantly, with many experts suggesting that CO2 emissions need to be cut by 45% by 2030 and reach net-zero by 2050.\n\n**Needed emissions cuts**\n\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has identified the need for significant emissions reductions to limit warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. To achieve this goal, emissions must be reduced by 45% by 2030, with net-zero emissions by 2050. This requires a dramatic shift away from fossil fuels and towards low-carbon energy sources.\n\n**Pledges**\n\nCountries have made various pledges to reduce their emissions, including the Paris Agreement, which aims to limit global warming to well below 2°C and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. However, these pledges are insufficient to meet the scale of emissions reductions needed, and many countries are falling short of their targets.\n\n**Low-carbon energy**\n\nLow-carbon energy sources, including solar, wind, and hydroelectric power, are becoming increasingly cost-competitive with fossil fuels. This shift is driving investment in renewable energy, with solar and wind energy expected to dominate the global energy mix by 2050.\n\n**Solar and wind energy**\n\nSolar and wind energy have become the fastest-growing sources of electricity globally, with solar energy now cheaper than coal in many parts of the world. Wind energy is also becoming increasingly cost-competitive, with many countries investing heavily in wind farms.\n\n**Other renewables**\n\nOther renewable energy sources, including hydroelectric power, geothermal energy, and biomass, also play an important role in the global energy mix. While these sources are less dominant than solar and wind, they are increasingly important for meeting energy demands.\n\n**Integrating variable renewable energy**\n\nVariable renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, pose challenges for grid management, as they are not always available when they are needed. To address this, grid operators are developing new technologies and strategies to integrate variable renewable energy into the grid.\n\n**Nuclear power**\n\nNuclear power remains an important source of low-carbon energy, providing around 10% of global electricity. While nuclear power is not carbon-free, it can play a role in reducing emissions in the transition to a low-carbon energy system.\n\n**Replacing coal with natural gas**\n\nNatural gas is increasingly being used to replace coal in power generation, with many countries investing in gas-fired power plants. While natural gas is a fossil fuel, it produces fewer emissions than coal, making it a cleaner-burning fuel.\n\n**Demand reduction**\n\nDemand reduction involves reducing energy consumption through energy conservation and efficiency measures. This can be achieved through various means, including energy-efficient appliances, building insulation, and behavioral changes.\n\n**Energy conservation and efficiency**\n\nEnergy conservation and efficiency measures can be implemented in various sectors, including buildings, transportation, and industry. These measures can help reduce energy consumption and emissions, while also saving households and businesses money.\n\n**Lifestyle changes**\n\nLifestyle changes, including dietary changes, can also help reduce emissions. For example, reducing meat consumption can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with agriculture.\n\n**Dietary change**\n\nDietary changes, such as reducing meat consumption, can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with agriculture. A plant-based diet can also help reduce the environmental impacts of food production.\n\n**Family size**\n\nFamily size can also impact emissions, with larger families generally producing more emissions. While family planning is a complex issue, reducing family size can help reduce emissions.\n\n**Preserving and enhancing carbon sinks**\n\nCarbon sinks, including forests, soils, and wetlands, play an important role in removing CO2 from the atmosphere. Preserving and enhancing these sinks can help mitigate climate change.\n\n**Forests**\n\nForests are a critical carbon sink, with trees absorbing CO2 through photosynthesis. Forests can be preserved and enhanced through reforestation and afforestation efforts.\n\n**Conservation**\n\nConservation efforts can help protect forests from deforestation and degradation, which can release stored carbon into the atmosphere.\n\n**Afforestation and reforestation**\n\nAfforestation and reforestation efforts can help restore forests and enhance carbon sequestration. This can be achieved through planting trees in areas where forests have been cleared or degraded.\n\n**Soils**\n\nSoils can also act as carbon sinks, with organic matter storing carbon. Soil conservation and restoration efforts can help enhance soil carbon sequestration.\n\n**Wetlands**\n\nWetlands, including mangroves and coral reefs, are also important carbon sinks. Preserving and restoring these ecosystems can help mitigate climate change.\n\n**Deep ocean**\n\nThe deep ocean can also act as a carbon sink, with sedimentation and biogeochemical processes removing CO2 from the atmosphere. However, this process is still not well understood and requires further research.\n\n**Enhanced weathering**\n\nEnhanced weathering involves accelerating the natural process of weathering rocks to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. This can be achieved through various means, including using minerals and microorganisms to enhance weathering rates.\n\n**Other methods to capture and store CO2**\n\nOther methods to capture and store CO2 include carbon capture and storage (CCS), which involves capturing CO2 emissions from power plants and storing them underground.\n\n**Mitigation by sector**\n\nClimate change mitigation involves various sectors, including buildings, transportation, agriculture, forestry, and industry.\n\n**Buildings**\n\nBuildings can be made more energy-efficient through various means, including insulation, double glazing, and renewable energy systems.\n\n**Urban planning**\n\nUrban planning can also help mitigate climate change, with cities designed to be more energy-efficient and sustainable.\n\n**Transport**\n\nTransportation is a significant source of emissions, with cars, trucks, and airplanes contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. Electric vehicles and alternative modes of transportation, such as cycling and walking, can help reduce emissions.\n\n**Shipping**\n\nShipping is also a significant source of emissions, with the maritime industry contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. Alternative fuels, such as liquefied natural gas (LNG) and hydrogen, can help reduce emissions from shipping.\n\n**Air transport**\n\nAir transport is also a significant source of emissions, with airplanes contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. Electric and hybrid-electric aircraft are being developed to reduce emissions from air transport.\n\n**Agriculture, forestry and land use**\n\nAgriculture, forestry, and land use are significant sources of emissions, with deforestation, livestock production, and fertilizer use contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. Sustainable agriculture and forestry practices can help reduce emissions.\n\n**Industry**\n\nIndustry is also a significant source of emissions, with various sectors contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. Energy efficiency and low-carbon technologies can help reduce emissions from industry.\n\n**Co-benefits**\n\nClimate change mitigation also has co-benefits, including employment and economic development, energy security, and improved health and well-being.\n\n**Employment and economic development**\n\nClimate change mitigation can create jobs and stimulate economic growth, particularly in the renewable energy sector.\n\n**Energy security**\n\nClimate change mitigation can also improve energy security, with renewable energy sources reducing dependence on fossil fuels.\n\n**Health and well-being**\n\nClimate change mitigation can also improve health and well-being, with reduced air pollution and improved access to clean water and sanitation.\n\n**Climate change adaptation**\n\nClimate change adaptation involves adapting to the impacts of climate change, including sea-level rise, more frequent natural disasters, and changing weather patterns.\n\n**Negative side effects**\n\nClimate change mitigation can also have negative side effects, including land use changes, water pollution, and social impacts.\n\n**Costs and funding**\n\nClimate change mitigation requires significant funding, with estimates suggesting that $1 trillion per year is needed to meet the scale of emissions reductions required.\n\n**Avoided costs of climate change effects**\n\nAvoided costs of climate change effects can provide a significant source of funding for climate change mitigation, including avoided damage to infrastructure and lost productivity.\n\n**Distributing emissions abatement costs**\n\nDistributing emissions abatement costs fairly and equitably is a complex challenge, with various approaches being proposed, including carbon pricing and cap-and-trade systems.\n\n**Funding**\n\nFunding for climate change mitigation can come from a variety of sources, including government budgets, private investors, and philanthropic organizations.\n\n**Policies**\n\nPolicies play a critical role in promoting climate change mitigation, including carbon pricing, clean energy standards, and energy efficiency standards.\n\n**National policies**\n\nNational policies can include carbon pricing, clean energy standards, and energy efficiency standards, as well as policies to support the development of low-carbon technologies.\n\n**Carbon pricing**\n\nCarbon pricing involves putting a price on carbon emissions, with the goal of reducing emissions and raising revenue for governments.\n\n**International agreements**\n\nInternational agreements, including the Paris Agreement, can provide a framework for global cooperation on climate change mitigation.\n\n**Paris Agreement**\n\nThe Paris Agreement is an international agreement that aims to limit global warming to well below 2°C and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.\n\n**History**\n\nClimate change mitigation has a long history, with efforts to reduce emissions dating back to the 1970s.\n\n**Society and culture**\n\nClimate change mitigation is influenced by societal and cultural factors, including public awareness and perception of climate change.\n\n**Commitments to divest**\n\nCommitments to divest from fossil fuels are becoming increasingly common, with many governments, companies, and individuals committing to end their investments in fossil fuels.\n\n**Barriers**\n\nBarriers to climate change mitigation include lack of awareness, lack of resources, and lack of policy support.\n\n**Impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic**\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had significant impacts on climate change mitigation, including reduced economic activity and decreased emissions.\n\n**Examples by country**\n\nClimate change mitigation efforts can be seen in many countries around the world, including the United States, China, and the European Union.\n\n**United States**\n\nThe United States has made significant efforts to reduce emissions, including the Clean Power Plan and the Renewable Fuel Standard.\n\n**China**\n\nChina has also made significant efforts to reduce emissions, including the National Emissions Reduction Plan and the Renewable Energy Law.\n\n**European Union**\n\nThe European Union has also made significant efforts to reduce emissions, including the Climate and Energy Package and the Renewable Energy Directive.\n\n**See also**\n\nClimate change mitigation is a complex and multifaceted issue, with many related topics, including climate change adaptation, sustainable development, and renewable energy.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

This system is essential for climbers to evaluate the level of risk, challenge, and overall experience associated with a particular route. The development of climbing grades has been a gradual process, with different systems emerging to suit various types of climbing.\n\n**History**\n\nThe concept of grading climbs dates back to the early 20th century, but it wasn't until the mid-20th century that standardized grading systems began to take shape. Initially, grades were determined by the climb's degree of difficulty, with easier climbs receiving lower grades and more challenging climbs receiving higher grades.\n\n**Free climbing**\n\nFree climbing is a type of climbing that involves ascending a rock face or mountain using only the climber's hands, feet, and body weight. The grading system for free climbing is essential in assessing the level of difficulty and risk associated with a particular route.\n\n### French numerical grade\n\nThe French numerical grade, also known as the \"Français\" or \"French point system,\" is a widely used grading system for free climbing. Developed in the 1950s and 1960s, the system assigns a numerical grade based on the climb's difficulty, with the lowest grade being 1 and the highest being 9. The French numerical grade is further divided into several sub-grades, including:\n\n* 1 (5.0+ or 5.2): Easy, beginner-friendly climbs\n* 2 (5.1-5.6): Moderate climbs\n* 3 (5.7-5.9): Challenging climbs\n* 4 (5.10-5.11): Difficult climbs\n* 5 (5.12-5.13): Very difficult climbs\n* 6 (5.14 and above): Extremely difficult climbs\n\n### American YDS grade\n\nThe American YDS (Yosemite Decimal System) grade is another widely used grading system for free climbing. Developed in the 1950s, the system assigns a numerical grade ranging from Class 1 (easiest) to Class 5 (most difficult). Within Class 5, the system uses a letter-based sub-grade (A, B, C, D, and E) to further refine the difficulty rating. The YDS grade is commonly used in the United States, particularly in Yosemite National Park.\n\n### UIAA scale\n\nThe UIAA (Union of International Alpine Associations) scale is a grading system used for free climbing in Europe and other parts of the world. Developed in the 1960s, the system assigns a numerical grade ranging from I (easiest) to VIII (most difficult). Within the UIAA scale, the system uses a letter-based sub-grade (A, B, C, D, and E) to further refine the difficulty rating.\n\n### British E-grade\n\nThe British E-grade system is a grading system used for free climbing in the United Kingdom. Developed in the 1960s, the system assigns an E-grade ranging from E1 (easiest) to E9 (most difficult). Within the E-grade system, the system uses a numerical sub-grade to further refine the difficulty rating.\n\n### Other notable systems\n\nOther notable grading systems for free climbing include the British HDU (Hardest Difficulty Used) system, the Japanese G-grade system, and the New Zealand B-grade system.\n\n**Bouldering**\n\nBouldering is a type of climbing that involves ascending short, low-level rock formations or boulders using only the climber's hands, feet, and body weight. The grading system for bouldering is essential in assessing the level of difficulty and risk associated with a particular route.\n\n### Comparison with free climbing\n\nBouldering grades are often lower than free climbing grades of the same difficulty. This is because bouldering climbs are typically shorter and more physically demanding than free climbing routes.\n\n### Font grade\n\nThe Font grade is a grading system used for bouldering in Fontainebleau, France. Developed in the 1960s, the system assigns a numerical grade ranging from 1 (easiest) to 12 (most difficult).\n\n### V-grade\n\nThe V-grade system is a grading system used for bouldering in the United States. Developed in the 1970s, the system assigns a numerical grade ranging from V0 (easiest) to V16 (most difficult).\n\n### Other notable systems\n\nOther notable grading systems for bouldering include the Russian G-grade system, the Australian B-grade system, and the German E-grade system.\n\n**Aid climbing**\n\nAid climbing is a type of climbing that involves ascending a rock face or mountain using equipment such as ladders, ropes, and pitons. The grading system for aid climbing is essential in assessing the level of difficulty and risk associated with a particular route.\n\n### Instability of aid grades\n\nAid climbing grades can be unstable and subject to change over time. This is because aid climbing grades are often determined by the amount of equipment used and the difficulty of the climb, which can vary depending on the conditions.\n\n### Original A-grade\n\nThe original A-grade system was developed in the 1960s and assigned a numerical grade ranging from A1 (easiest) to A5 (most difficult).\n\n### New wave A-grade\n\nThe new wave A-grade system was developed in the 1980s and assigned a numerical grade ranging from A0 (easiest) to A5 (most difficult).\n\n### Clean C-grade\n\nThe clean C-grade system was developed in the 1990s and assigned a numerical grade ranging from C0 (easiest) to C5 (most difficult).\n\n**Ice and mixed climbing**\n\nIce and mixed climbing involve ascending ice formations or combining ice and rock climbing techniques. The grading system for ice and mixed climbing is essential in assessing the level of difficulty and risk associated with a particular route.\n\n### WI-grade\n\nThe WI (Water Ice) grade system is a grading system used for ice climbing in North America. Developed in the 1960s, the system assigns a numerical grade ranging from WI1 (easiest) to WI11 (most difficult).\n\n### M-grade\n\nThe M-grade system is a grading system used for mixed climbing in Europe. Developed in the 1980s, the system assigns a numerical grade ranging from M1 (easiest) to M12 (most difficult).\n\n### D-grade\n\nThe D-grade system is a grading system used for ice climbing in the United States.

His work had a lasting impact on the development of science and education in Australia.\n\n**Family**\n\nGerard Krefft was born in 1830 in the Kingdom of Hanover, Germany. His parents were Johann and Maria Krefft. Little is known about his early life, but it is believed that he was educated in a local school before pursuing his interest in natural history.\n\n**Education**\n\nKrefft's education in natural history began in his homeland, where he studied under notable naturalists, including Professor Carl Gloger. He also worked as a taxidermist and a natural history artist, skills that would serve him well in his future career.\n\n**Marriage**\n\nKrefft married Mary Ann McLaren in 1860, and they had two children together. Mary Ann was a strong supporter of her husband's work and often assisted him in his research and artistic endeavors.\n\n**German heritage**\n\nKrefft's German heritage had a significant impact on his work and worldview. His education in natural history was rooted in the traditions of German science and taxidermy. His exposure to the works of German naturalists, such as Johann Friedrich Blumenbach and Georg August Goldfuss, influenced his understanding of evolution and natural history.\n\n**\"Natural history\"**\n\nKrefft's work in natural history was characterized by his meticulous attention to detail and his commitment to scientific accuracy. He was particularly interested in the study of Australian wildlife, which he considered to be \"one of the most interesting and attractive branches of the science of natural history\".\n\n**\"Darwinian doctrine\" and the consequent \"Darwinian controversy\"**\n\nKrefft was a strong supporter of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution through natural selection. He believed that the evidence from natural history supported the idea of evolution, and he saw it as a key to understanding the diversity of life on Earth. However, Krefft's views on evolution were not without controversy. Many of his contemporaries, including some scientists and theologians, rejected the idea of evolution as a threat to traditional Christian teachings.\n\n**Evolution**\n\nKrefft's understanding of evolution was shaped by his study of the natural history of Australia. He saw the country's unique fauna as evidence of the power of evolution to create species over time. He also believed that the fossil record provided strong evidence for the idea of evolution, as it showed a clear progression of life forms over millions of years.\n\n**Natural selection**\n\nKrefft was particularly interested in the concept of natural selection, which he saw as the driving force behind evolution. He believed that the process of natural selection, where species adapt to their environments through the survival of the fittest, was a key mechanism for the creation of new species.\n\n**Ellegård's five \"positions\" held by scientists in the Darwinian controversy**\n\nKrefft's views on evolution can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. **Theistic evolutionist**: Krefft believed that evolution was a natural process guided by a higher power.\n2. **Materialistic evolutionist**: Krefft saw evolution as a purely natural process, driven by the laws of physics and chemistry.\n3. **Gradualist**: Krefft believed that evolution occurred gradually over long periods of time, through the accumulation of small changes.\n4. **Transformist**: Krefft saw evolution as a process of transformation, where one species could give rise to another through a series of gradual changes.\n5. **Mechanicist**: Krefft believed that evolution was a mechanical process, driven by the laws of physics and chemistry.\n\n**Artist**\n\nKrefft was a skilled artist and illustrator, and his work in this field was highly regarded by his contemporaries. He was particularly interested in the depiction of Australian wildlife, and his illustrations of these animals were considered to be among the best of their kind.\n\n**Victoria (1852 – 1858)**\n\nKrefft's work in Victoria was characterized by his interest in the natural history of the region. He was particularly interested in the study of Australian wildlife, and his work in this field helped to establish him as a leading authority on the subject.\n\n**Melbourne**\n\nKrefft's work in Melbourne was marked by his involvement in the establishment of the Museum of Natural History, which was dedicated to the study and display of Australian wildlife. He was also involved in the development of the museum's collections, which included a wide range of specimens from around the world.\n\n**Blandowski, the Museum of Natural History, and Professor McCoy**\n\nKrefft's work in Melbourne was also influenced by his association with other notable naturalists, including Professor Charles Blandowski and Professor Frederick McCoy. These individuals helped to shape Krefft's understanding of natural history and his approach to the study of Australian wildlife.\n\n**Germany**\n\nKrefft's work in Germany was characterized by his interest in the natural history of the region. He was particularly interested in the study of German wildlife, and his work in this field helped to establish him as a leading authority on the subject.\n\n**Natural historian, museum curator and administrator**\n\nKrefft's work as a natural historian, museum curator, and administrator was marked by his commitment to the study and display of Australian wildlife. He was particularly interested in the development of public museums, which he saw as a key to promoting public understanding of natural history.\n\n**Darwinism**\n\nKrefft's work as a natural historian was influenced by his commitment to Darwinism, which he saw as a key to understanding the diversity of life on Earth. He believed that the evidence from natural history supported the idea of evolution, and he saw it as a key to understanding the natural world.\n\n**\"The New Museum Idea\"**\n\nKrefft's work as a museum curator and administrator was marked by his commitment to the development of public museums. He believed that these institutions should be dedicated to the study and display of natural history, and that they should be accessible to the public.\n\n**Cabinets of curiosities**\n\nKrefft's work as a natural historian was influenced by his interest in cabinets of curiosities, which were collections of unusual and exotic specimens from around the world. He saw these collections as a key to understanding the natural world, and he was particularly interested in the development of public museums that would display these specimens.\n\n**Public museums**\n\nKrefft's work as a museum curator and administrator was marked by his commitment to the development of public museums. He believed that these institutions should be dedicated to the study and display of natural history, and that they should be accessible to the public.\n\n**The \"new museum\"**\n\nKrefft's work as a museum curator and administrator was influenced by his interest in the development of the \"new museum\", which was a public institution dedicated to the study and display of natural history. He saw this institution as a key to promoting public understanding of natural history, and he was particularly interested in the development of its collections.\n\n**Krefft's curatorial rationale**\n\nKrefft's work as a museum curator and administrator was marked by his commitment to the development of public museums. He believed that these institutions should be dedicated to the study and display of natural history, and that they should be accessible to the public.\n\n**Lack of funding**\n\nKrefft's work as a museum curator and administrator was often hindered by a lack of funding. He believed that public museums should be supported by government funding, but this was not always the case.\n\n**Photography**\n\nKrefft's work as a natural historian was influenced by his interest in photography, which was a relatively new technology at the time. He saw photography as a key to documenting and studying natural history, and he was particularly interested in the development of photographic equipment and techniques.\n\n**Queensland lungfish (Neoceratodus forsteri)**\n\nKrefft's work as a natural historian was marked by his interest in the study of Australian wildlife, including the Queensland lungfish. He was particularly interested in the study of this species, which was considered to be one of the most interesting and unusual animals in the world.\n\n**Louis Agassiz and the Chimaera**\n\nKrefft's work as a natural historian was influenced by his interest in the work of Louis Agassiz, a Swiss naturalist who was known for his work on the Chimaera. Krefft was particularly interested in the study of this species, which was considered to be one of the most interesting and unusual animals in the world.\n\n**Gerard Krefft, William Forster, and the cartilaginous Burnett Salmon or barramunda**\n\nKrefft's work as a natural historian was marked by his interest in the study of Australian wildlife, including the cartilaginous Burnett Salmon or barramunda. He was particularly interested in the study of this species, which was considered to be one of the most interesting and unusual animals in the world.\n\n**January 1870**\n\nKrefft's work as a natural historian was marked by his interest in the study of Australian wildlife, including the Queensland lungfish. He was particularly interested in the study of this species, which was considered to be one of the most interesting and unusual animals in the world.\n\n**Krefft's \"Natural History\" articles in The Sydney Mail**\n\nKrefft's work as a natural historian was marked by his interest in writing articles about natural history for The Sydney Mail. He was particularly interested in the study of Australian wildlife, and his articles helped to promote public understanding of the subject.\n\n**George B. Mason and The Australian Home Companion and Band of Hope Journal**\n\nKrefft's work as a natural historian was influenced by his interest in the work of George B. Mason, a journalist who wrote for The Australian Home Companion and Band of Hope Journal.

The election was the country's first parliamentary election since the 2018 election, and it was held amidst significant political and economic turmoil.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe election took place in a context of ongoing protests and economic crisis in Lebanon. The 2019–21 Lebanese protests began in October 2019, with demonstrators calling for the resignation of the government and the implementation of reforms. The protests led to the resignation of the government in October 2019, but a new government was formed in January 2020 without meeting the protesters' demands.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic also had a significant impact on the country, with the first cases reported in February 2020. The pandemic led to a nationwide lockdown, which was lifted in June 2020, but it had a significant impact on the economy.\n\nThe Beirut explosion on August 4, 2020, was another major event that took place before the election. The explosion occurred at the Port of Beirut, killing over 200 people and injuring thousands. The explosion was widely condemned, and it led to the resignation of the government in August 2020.\n\n**Electorate**\n\nThe Lebanese electorate is divided into 15 electoral districts, each with a varying number of seats. The electoral system is a combination of proportional representation and first-past-the-post voting.\n\nThe registered voters in Lebanon are required to be Lebanese citizens, aged 21 or older, and living in the country. The electoral rolls are managed by the Ministry of Interior and Municipalities.\n\n**Lebanese living abroad**\n\nLebanese citizens living abroad are also entitled to vote in the election. The Lebanese diaspora is estimated to be around 4 million people, with significant communities in countries such as Brazil, the United States, and Canada.\n\n**Candidates**\n\nA total of 597 candidates ran in the election, with 143 running as independents. The candidates were divided into 22 political parties and alliances, with the largest number of candidates running under the banner of the Future Movement.\n\n**Withdrawals**\n\nSeveral candidates withdrew from the election in the days leading up to the vote. The withdrawals included some prominent figures, such as the Kataeb Party's leader, Samir Geagea.\n\n**Opinion polls**\n\nSeveral opinion polls were conducted in the run-up to the election, with some polling firms predicting a significant shift in the balance of power in the Parliament. However, the polls were not always accurate, and the final results were different from what many had expected.\n\n**Political parties and coalitions**\n\nSeveral political parties and coalitions ran in the election, including:\n\n* **Future Movement**: The Future Movement is a centrist coalition led by former Prime Minister Saad Hariri. The party has a significant following in the country and ran a large number of candidates in the election.\n* **Kataeb Party**: The Kataeb Party is a right-wing party led by Samir Geagea.
