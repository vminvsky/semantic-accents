The album marks a departure from Swift's previous work, exploring themes of self-discovery, love, and existential crises.\n\n**Background**\n\nMidnights is the result of Swift's collaboration with a team of songwriters and producers, including Jack Antonoff, Aaron Dessner, and Zachary Elman. The album's creation was a response to Swift's own experiences and emotions, as well as the global events that had unfolded during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n**Concept and writing**\n\nThe concept of Midnights revolves around the idea of a \"midnight moment\" – a time of introspection and self-discovery that occurs in the stillness of the night. This theme is reflected in the album's 13 tracks, which explore various aspects of love, loss, and personal growth.\n\n**Themes**\n\nThe album's themes can be broadly categorized into three main areas:\n\n* **Love and relationships**: Tracks like \"Antics\" and \"Karma\" delve into the complexities of romance and the consequences of one's actions.\n* **Self-discovery and existential crises**: Songs like \"Lavender Haze\" and \"Vigilante Shit\" grapple with questions of identity, purpose, and the search for meaning.\n* **Mental health and wellness**: Tracks like \"Maroon\" and \"Bejeweled\" touch on themes of anxiety, depression, and the importance of self-care.\n\n**Production and music**\n\nMidnights features a varied and experimental sound, incorporating elements of indie rock, electronic music, and pop. The album's production is characterized by its use of synthesizers, drum machines, and distorted guitars. Swift's vocals are often processed through various effects, creating a sense of texture and depth.\n\n**Artwork and aesthetics**\n\nThe album's artwork features a minimalist design, with a focus on typography and color. The cover art is a stylized representation of the number \"13,\" which holds significant meaning for Swift. The album's aesthetic is largely influenced by the works of avant-garde artists and designers.\n\n**Release and promotion**\n\nMidnights was released on October 21, 2022, and was accompanied by a series of promotional events and music videos. Swift performed several of the album's tracks on television and at live concerts, generating widespread media attention and public interest.\n\n**Commercial performance**\n\nMidnights debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling over 1 million copies in its first week. The album has since been certified multi-platinum in several countries, including the United States, Canada, and Australia.\n\n**Critical reception**\n\nMidnights received widespread critical acclaim upon its release, with many praising Swift's songwriting and experimentation. The album holds a Metacritic score of 89 out of 100, based on 21 reviews.\n\n**Rankings**\n\n* **Rolling Stone**: Ranked #1 on the \"50 Best Albums of 2022\"\n* **NME**: Ranked #2 on the \"50 Best Albums of 2022\"\n* **The Guardian**: Ranked #3 on the \"100 Best Albums of 2022\"\n\n**Awards**\n\nMidnights has been nominated for several awards, including:\n\n* **Grammy Award for Album of the Year** (2023)\n* **American Music Award for Favorite Pop/Rock Album** (2022)\n* **Billboard Music Award for Top Billboard 200 Album** (2023)\n\n**Impact**\n\nMidnights has had a significant impact on popular culture and the music industry, introducing a new wave of experimental and introspective songwriting.

Hart's HSCA testimony\n#Reactions to his Spy Wars book\n#In popular culture\n#Personal life\n#References\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Tennent H. Bagley\n\nTennent H. Bagley is a retired American intelligence officer and historian who worked extensively in the field of counterintelligence during the Cold War. Bagley's notable contributions to the field include his work on the KGB-CIA war, his involvement in several high-profile espionage cases, and his writing on the subject of espionage and counterintelligence.\n\n**Early life and education**\n\nTennent H. Bagley was born on June 13, 1927, in the United States. Little is known about his early life, but it is reported that Bagley developed an interest in history and international relations at a young age. He attended the University of Wisconsin, where he graduated with a degree in history. After completing his undergraduate degree, Bagley went on to earn a master's degree in international relations from the University of Wisconsin as well.\n\n**Career**\n\nBagley began his career in the US intelligence community in the 1950s, working for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). During his time at the CIA, Bagley worked extensively in the field of counterintelligence, where he focused on uncovering and countering the espionage efforts of the Soviet Union's foreign intelligence agency, the KGB. Bagley's work in this field earned him a reputation as one of the leading experts on Soviet espionage and counterintelligence.\n\nBagley's work at the CIA took him to several foreign postings, including Berlin and Paris. In Berlin, Bagley worked closely with the West German intelligence agency, the BND, to uncover and counter Soviet espionage efforts in the city. In Paris, Bagley worked with the French intelligence agency, the DGSE, to counter Soviet espionage efforts in Western Europe.\n\n**Bagley's Analysis of the KGB-CIA War**\n\nIn his book \"Spy Wars: Moles, Mysteries, and Deadly Games\", Bagley provides a comprehensive analysis of the KGB-CIA war, a decades-long struggle between the CIA and the KGB for intelligence superiority and control. According to Bagley, the KGB-CIA war was a complex and multifaceted struggle that involved the use of spies, moles, and other intelligence operatives to gather and manipulate intelligence.\n\nBagley argues that the KGB-CIA war was a key factor in the Cold War, with both sides using espionage and counterintelligence to undermine the other's efforts. He also argues that the war was marked by a series of high-profile espionage cases, including the cases of Kim Philby, Aldrich Ames, and Robert Hanssen.\n\n**The Popov Case**\n\nOne of the most notable espionage cases of the Cold War was the case of Dusan \"Dusko\" Popov, a Yugoslavian-born intelligence officer who worked for the British and the Germans during World War II. Popov was recruited by the British to work as a double agent, providing them with intelligence on the German military. However, Popov also worked for the Germans, providing them with information on the British and American war efforts.\n\nBagley was involved in the investigation of Popov's case, and his work helped to uncover the full extent of Popov's treachery. According to Bagley, Popov's case was a classic example of a \"double agent\", who worked for both the British and the Germans during the war.\n\n**The Golienewski Case**\n\nAnother notable espionage case of the Cold War was the case of Rudolf Golienewski, a German-born engineer who worked for the CIA. Golienewski was recruited by the CIA to work as a spy, providing them with intelligence on the Soviet Union's military and economic efforts. However, Golienewski was also working for the KGB, providing them with information on the CIA's efforts.\n\nBagley was involved in the investigation of Golienewski's case, and his work helped to uncover the full extent of Golienewski's treachery. According to Bagley, Golienewski's case was a classic example of a \"mole\", who worked for the enemy while pretending to work for the good guys.\n\n**The Nosenko Case**\n\nOne of the most notable espionage cases of the Cold War was the case of Anatoli Nosenko, a Soviet-born intelligence officer who defected to the West. Nosenko claimed to have information on the KGB's efforts, but his claims were later disputed by the CIA. Bagley was involved in the investigation of Nosenko's case, and his work helped to uncover the full extent of Nosenko's treachery.\n\nAccording to Bagley, Nosenko's case was a classic example of a \"defector\", who provided the West with false information in order to gain their trust. Bagley argues that Nosenko's case was a key factor in the CIA's decision to launch a series of operations against the KGB, including the use of spies and moles to gather and manipulate intelligence.\n\n**Nosenko and the \"Zepp\" Incident**\n\nOne of the most notable incidents of the Cold War was the \"Zepp\" incident, in which a group of Soviet spies were caught in the act of stealing American secrets. According to Bagley, the \"Zepp\" incident was a classic example of the KGB's use of spies and moles to gather and manipulate intelligence. Bagley argues that the \"Zepp\" incident was a key factor in the CIA's decision to launch a series of operations against the KGB, including the use of spies and moles to gather and manipulate intelligence.\n\n**More Nosenko**\n\nBagley's work on the Nosenko case led him to uncover more information on the Soviet Union's efforts to manipulate American intelligence. According to Bagley, the Soviet Union used a variety of tactics to manipulate American intelligence, including the use of spies, moles, and double agents. Bagley argues that the Soviet Union's efforts to manipulate American intelligence were a key factor in the Cold War, and that they had a significant impact on the outcome of the war.\n\n**The KITTY HAWK / Shadrin Case**\n\nOne of the most notable espionage cases of the Cold War was the case of KITTY HAWK, a Soviet-born intelligence officer who worked for the CIA. KITTY HAWK was recruited by the CIA to work as a spy, providing them with intelligence on the Soviet Union's military and economic efforts. However, KITTY HAWK was also working for the KGB, providing them with information on the CIA's efforts.\n\nBagley was involved in the investigation of KITTY HAWK's case, and his work helped to uncover the full extent of KITTY HAWK's treachery. According to Bagley, KITTY HAWK's case was a classic example of a \"double agent\", who worked for both the CIA and the KGB during the Cold War.\n\n**Rebuttal to John L. Hart's HSCA testimony**\n\nBagley was involved in a number of cases that were investigated by the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA). One of the most notable cases was the case of John L. Hart, a CIA officer who was accused of being involved in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Bagley testified before the HSCA, providing a rebuttal to Hart's testimony. According to Bagley, Hart's testimony was inaccurate and misleading, and he argued that Hart was not involved in the assassination of President Kennedy.\n\n**Reactions to his Spy Wars book**\n\nBagley's book \"Spy Wars: Moles, Mysteries, and Deadly Games\" was widely reviewed and discussed in the media. Many reviewers praised the book for its detailed and engaging account of the KGB-CIA war. Others criticized the book for its lack of objectivity and its perceived anti-Soviet bias. According to Bagley, his book was a comprehensive and accurate account of the KGB-CIA war, and he argued that it was a key factor in the outcome of the Cold War.\n\n**In popular culture**\n\nBagley's work on the KGB-CIA war has been referenced in a number of popular culture works, including films, TV shows, and books. One of the most notable examples is the film \"Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy\", which was based on the novel of the same name by John le Carré. According to Bagley, the film was an accurate and engaging account of the KGB-CIA war, and he argued that it was a key factor in the outcome of the Cold War.\n\n**Personal life**\n\nBagley is a retired CIA officer who lives in the United States. He has written extensively on the subject of espionage and counterintelligence, and he has been involved in a number of high-profile cases throughout his career. According to Bagley, his work on the KGB-CIA war was a key factor in the outcome of the Cold War, and he argued that it had a significant impact on the outcome of the war.\n\n**References**\n\nThis article is a comprehensive and accurate account of the life and work of Tennent H.

Sandberg. The screenplay is based on the novel of the same name by Blake Crouch, which was adapted from the novel's author's own short story. The film stars Jamie Bell, Sarah Snook, and Andrew Bachelor.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe story revolves around a detective named Billy Ransom, who is investigating a series of gruesome and bizarre murders. Billy discovers that the killer is using a specific inkblot test, known as the Rorschach test, to determine his victims' guilt or innocence. The test, which involves staring at symmetrical inkblots and interpreting their shapes, is used by psychologists to assess a person's personality and emotional state. However, in the film, it serves as a sinister tool for the killer to manipulate and control his victims.\n\nAs Billy delves deeper into the case, he becomes increasingly entangled in a world of psychological manipulation and mind games. The killer, who is revealed to be a former psychologist, is using the Rorschach test to create a sense of uncertainty and chaos among his victims. Billy must navigate this complex web of psychological warfare to uncover the killer's true identity and motives.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Jamie Bell as Billy Ransom, a detective investigating the series of murders.\n* Sarah Snook as Emily Ransom, Billy's wife, who is struggling to cope with her husband's obsessive nature.\n* Andrew Bachelor as Detective Rodriguez, Billy's partner, who is skeptical of Billy's theories.\n* Sophie Rundle as Lucy, a psychologist who is questioned by Billy about the Rorschach test.\n* Robert Sheehan as Tommy, a suspect in the case who is revealed to be a former patient of the killer.\n\n**Production**\n\n#### Development\n\nThe film was first announced in 2018, with Jamie Bell set to star and David F. Sandberg set to direct. Blake Crouch, the author of the novel, was revealed to be adapting his own work for the screen. The film's script was reportedly written in collaboration with Crouch, who drew inspiration from his own experiences as a psychologist.\n\n#### Filming\n\nPrincipal photography for the film began in June 2019 and wrapped up in August of the same year. The film was shot on location in Los Angeles, California, and used a combination of practical and CGI effects to create the film's eerie atmosphere.\n\n### Music\n\nThe film's score was composed by John Carpenter, who is known for his iconic scores for horror classics such as Halloween and The Fog. Carpenter's score for Rorschach features a eerie and atmospheric soundtrack that perfectly captures the film's sense of unease and tension.\n\n### Marketing\n\nThe film's marketing campaign was focused on creating a sense of mystery and intrigue around the film. The film's trailer, which was released in January 2020, featured a series of cryptic images and audio snippets that hinted at the film's dark and psychological themes.\n\n### Release\n\n#### Theatrical\n\nThe film was released in theaters on August 28, 2020, in the United States and Canada. It was initially released in limited theaters, but later expanded to a wider release in September 2020.\n\n#### Home media\n\nThe film was released on DVD and Blu-ray on November 17, 2020. The Blu-ray release features a series of bonus features, including deleted scenes, behind-the-scenes footage, and a commentary track with the director and cast.\n\n**Reception**\n\n### Box office\n\nThe film grossed $12.4 million worldwide, with $9.4 million of that coming from the United States. The film's box office performance was considered disappointing, given its production budget of $15 million.\n\n### Critical response\n\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics, with an approval rating of 42% on Rotten Tomatoes. Some critics praised the film's atmospheric tension and Jamie Bell's performance, while others found the film's pacing and plot to be uneven. The film has a rating of 4.5/10 on IMDB, based on over 10,000 user reviews.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The idea for the service was conceived during a dinner party hosted by Evan Williams, where Jack Dorsey and Biz Stone began brainstorming ideas for a short messaging service. The first prototype was called \"twttr,\" and it was launched in July 2006. The initial reaction to the service was mixed, with some users finding it confusing and others enjoying its simplicity.\n\n### **2007–2010**\n\nIn 2007, Twitter introduced the concept of \"tweets\" and the ability for users to follow each other. The service quickly gained popularity, with the number of users growing from 60,000 in July 2007 to 6 million in August 2008. In 2009, Twitter introduced the \"retweet\" feature, which allowed users to share tweets with their followers. This feature became an essential part of the Twitter experience and helped to increase user engagement.\n\n### **2010–2014**\n\nIn 2010, Twitter introduced a new design and layout, which made it easier for users to navigate the service. The company also introduced the concept of \"lists,\" which allowed users to group and categorize their followers. In 2011, Twitter introduced the \" Moments\" feature, which allowed users to create curated collections of tweets. This feature helped to increase user engagement and made it easier for users to discover new content.\n\n### **2014–2020**\n\nIn 2014, Twitter introduced the \"algorithm\" that prioritized tweets based on their relevance and engagement.

The site, also known as the \"American Stonehenge,\" was erected in 1979 and features a set of inscriptions in eight different languages, as well as an explanatory tablet and various astronomical features.\n\n**History**\n\n### Construction\n\nThe Georgia Guidestones were constructed by an unknown person or group who referred to themselves as \"R.C.\" The project was completed in March 1979, and the site was officially dedicated on March 22, 1979.\n\n### Reaction\n\nThe Georgia Guidestones received a mix of positive and negative reactions from the public upon their completion. Some saw the site as a work of art and a thought-provoking monument, while others viewed it as a pagan or satanic symbol. The site's remote location in Elbert County was also seen as a factor in its relatively low profile, with many people in the surrounding area unaware of its existence.\n\n### Destruction\n\nOn July 6, 2022, the Georgia Guidestones were partially destroyed in an act of vandalism. The site's monument was struck by a vehicle and three of its four pillars were toppled. The incident was widely reported in the media, with many speculating about the motivations behind the attack.\n\n#### Aftermath\n\nFollowing the destruction of the Georgia Guidestones, the site's owner, Elbert County, announced plans to repair and restore the monument. The county also increased security measures at the site, including the installation of surveillance cameras and additional lighting.\n\n**Description**\n\n### Inscriptions\n\nThe Georgia Guidestones feature a set of inscriptions in eight different languages, including English, Spanish, Swahili, Hindi, Hebrew, Arabic, Chinese, and Russian. The inscriptions are as follows:\n\n1. \"Let these be guidestones to an Age of Reason\"\n2. \"Unity, Wisdom, Love, Honesty, Righteousness, Peace\"\n3. \"Guide reproduction wisely – improving fitness and diversity\"\n4. \"Unite humanity with a living new language\"\n5. \"Rule passion – faith – tradition – and all things with tempered reason\"\n6. \"Protect people and nations with fair laws and just courts\"\n7. \"Let any free person be a captain of their soul\"\n8. \"Be not a cancer on the earth – Leave room for nature – Leave room for nature\"\n\n### Explanatory tablet\n\nThe explanatory tablet at the Georgia Guidestones provides additional context and information about the site's purpose and meaning. The tablet reads:\n\n\"Let these be guidestones to an Age of Reason. Balance personal rights with social duties. Prize truth – beauty – knowledge – but leave room for doubt. Cultivate creativeness – imagination – individuality – but avoid arrogance. Keep learning – from children to elders. Respect the privacy and autonomy of individuals and families. Diversify and strengthen communities. Banish dogma – free minds for diversity. Unite humanity with a living new language. Guide reproduction wisely – improving fitness and diversity. Protect people and nations with fair laws and just courts. Be not a cancer on the earth – Leave room for nature – Leave room for nature.\"\n\n### Physical data\n\nThe Georgia Guidestones are composed of four large granite pillars, each weighing over 20 tons. The pillars are 16.5 feet (5 meters) tall and 3.5 feet (1.1 meters) wide. The site also features a capstone and an astronomical table.\n\n### Guidestone languages\n\nThe Georgia Guidestones feature inscriptions in eight different languages, including:\n\n1. English\n2. Spanish\n3. Swahili\n4. Hindi\n5. Hebrew\n6. Arabic\n7. Chinese\n8. Russian\n\n### Astronomical features\n\nThe Georgia Guidestones feature an astronomical table that includes various celestial bodies and their corresponding coordinates. The table includes information about the sun, moon, planets, and stars.\n\n**Interpretations**\n\n### Conspiracy theories\n\nThe Georgia Guidestones have been the subject of various conspiracy theories over the years. Some believe that the site is a hub for secret societies or that it contains hidden messages or codes. Others believe that the site is a tool for promoting a New World Order or that it is somehow connected to extraterrestrial life.\n\n**See also**\n\n* American Stonehenge\n* Secret societies\n* Conspiracy theories\n* New World Order\n\n**Further reading**\n\n* \"The Georgia Guidestones: A Guide to the New World Order\" by James R.

It covers approximately 148,940,000 square kilometers (57,491,000 sq mi), which is about 29.2% of the Earth's total surface area.\n\n**Definition**\n\nLand is a complex and dynamic system that encompasses various natural and human-made features. It is a critical component of the Earth's ecosystem, providing habitat for a vast array of plant and animal species, as well as serving as a source of natural resources, such as water, minerals, and fossil fuels.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe term \"land\" comes from Old English \"land,\" which was derived from the Proto-Germanic word \"*landiz,\" meaning \"country\" or \"earth.\" This word is also related to the Proto-Indo-European root \"*ten-,\" which meant \"to stretch\" or \"to extend.\"\n\n**Physical Science**\n\n### Formation\n\nLand is formed through various geological processes, including plate tectonics, weathering, and erosion. Plate tectonics involves the movement of the Earth's lithosphere, which can lead to the formation of mountains, volcanoes, and earthquakes. Weathering and erosion, on the other hand, involve the breakdown and removal of rocks and minerals, which can create landforms such as canyons, gorges, and valleys.\n\n### Landmasses\n\nThe Earth's landmasses are divided into several major continents, including Asia, Africa, Antarctica, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America. These continents are further subdivided into smaller landmasses, such as islands, archipelagos, and peninsulas.\n\n### Terrain\n\nLand terrain can be broadly classified into several types, including:\n\n* **Plains**: flat or gently sloping areas of land, often formed through the erosion of surrounding hills and mountains.\n* **Mountains**: elevated areas of land, formed through the movement of tectonic plates or the erosion of surrounding rocks.\n* **Plateaus**: elevated areas of land, often formed through the erosion of surrounding rocks or the movement of tectonic plates.\n* **Hills**: smaller, rounded areas of land, often formed through the erosion of surrounding rocks.\n\n### Geomorphology\n\nGeomorphology is the study of the shape and structure of the Earth's surface. It involves the analysis of landforms, including mountains, valleys, and plateaus, as well as the processes that shape them, such as weathering, erosion, and deposition.\n\n### Climate\n\nClimate refers to the average weather conditions in a particular region over a long period of time. Land climate can be broadly classified into several types, including:\n\n* **Tropical**: hot and humid, with high levels of rainfall.\n* **Desert**: hot and dry, with low levels of rainfall.\n* **Temperate**: mild and temperate, with moderate levels of rainfall.\n* **Polar**: cold and dry, with low levels of rainfall.\n\n**Features**\n\n### Coasts and Islands\n\nCoasts and islands are critical components of the Earth's land system, providing habitat for a vast array of plant and animal species, as well as serving as a source of natural resources, such as fish and minerals.\n\n### Mountains and Plateaus\n\nMountains and plateaus are formed through the movement of tectonic plates or the erosion of surrounding rocks. They provide habitat for a range of plant and animal species, as well as serving as a source of natural resources, such as minerals and fossil fuels.\n\n### Plains and Valleys\n\nPlains and valleys are formed through the erosion of surrounding hills and mountains. They provide habitat for a range of plant and animal species, as well as serving as a source of natural resources, such as water and minerals.\n\n### Caves and Craters\n\nCaves and craters are formed through the erosion of rocks and minerals, often through the action of water or wind. They provide habitat for a range of plant and animal species, as well as serving as a source of natural resources, such as minerals and fossil fuels.\n\n**Layers**\n\n### Land Cover\n\nLand cover refers to the physical surface of the Earth's land, including features such as vegetation, water, and minerals. It is a critical component of the Earth's ecosystem, providing habitat for a vast array of plant and animal species.\n\n### Soil\n\nSoil is the upper layer of the Earth's surface, formed through the weathering of rocks and minerals. It provides habitat for a range of plant and animal species, as well as serving as a source of natural resources, such as water and minerals.\n\n### Continental Crust\n\nThe continental crust is the outermost layer of the Earth, formed through the cooling and solidification of magma. It provides habitat for a range of plant and animal species, as well as serving as a source of natural resources, such as minerals and fossil fuels.\n\n**Life Science**\n\n### Land Biomes\n\nLand biomes are large areas of land characterized by specific types of vegetation and climate.

From its humble beginnings to the present day, the telephone has played a pivotal role in shaping American society and culture.\n\n#AT&T and the Bell System\n\n##American Bell Telephone Company (1881–1899)\n\nThe telephone was invented by Alexander Graham Bell in 1876, and the American Bell Telephone Company was formed in 1881 to manage the patent and manufacture the device. The company's early years were marked by rapid growth, with the number of telephones in use increasing from 25 in 1877 to over 150,000 by 1890. American Bell was granted a monopoly on telephone manufacturing and operation by the federal government, which allowed it to expand its operations and establish the Bell System.\n\n##AT&T (1899–1982)\n\nIn 1899, American Bell Telephone Company merged with the Bell Telephone Company of New York to form the Bell Telephone Company of North America, which later became the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T). AT&T continued to expand the Bell System, introducing new technologies such as the rotary dial and touch-tone phones. During World War II, AT&T played a significant role in the war effort, providing communication services to the military.\n\n##Research priority\n\nAT&T was committed to research and development, investing heavily in the creation of new technologies and improving existing ones. The company established research centers in the United States and around the world, employing thousands of scientists and engineers to work on cutting-edge projects. Some notable achievements include the development of the first transcontinental telephone line, the introduction of direct distance dialing, and the creation of the first commercial mobile phone network.\n\n##Targeting an audience\n\n###Urban public telephones\n\nIn the early 20th century, AT&T began to focus on urban public telephones, installing payphones in cities across the United States. This made it possible for people to make phone calls from public locations, expanding access to the telephone network. The introduction of coin-operated phones also helped to increase revenue for AT&T.\n\n###Rural telephone service\n\nAT&T also expanded its services to rural areas, installing telephone lines and switching equipment to serve rural communities. This required significant investment, but it helped to bring the benefits of telecommunications to more people. The company also introduced the concept of \"party line\" service, where multiple households shared a single telephone line.\n\n##Breakup of AT&T in 1982\n\nIn 1982, AT&T was broken up into seven regional Bell operating companies (RBOCs) by the United States government, following a lengthy antitrust suit. This marked the end of the Bell System as a single entity and paved the way for the modern telecommunications industry. The breakup had significant consequences for AT&T, but it also created opportunities for competition and innovation.\n\n#Cellphones and smartphones\n\nThe introduction of cellphones in the 1980s marked a significant shift in the telecommunications industry. Cellphones allowed people to make calls and send messages from anywhere, at any time, using a mobile device. The first smartphone, the IBM Simon, was released in 1994, and it combined the features of a phone, computer, and personal digital assistant (PDA). Smartphones have since become ubiquitous, with millions of people around the world using them to access the internet, communicate with others, and perform a wide range of tasks.\n\n#Personnel\n\n##Switchboard and operators\n\nSwitchboard operators played a crucial role in the early days of the telephone industry, connecting calls and providing information to callers. They worked in switching centers, using manual switches to connect calls between different lines. The introduction of automated switching systems eventually replaced human operators, but the role of switchboard operators remains an important part of telephone history.\n\n##Labor force: bias for and against women\n\nThe telephone industry has had a complex and sometimes contentious relationship with women. In the early 20th century, women were often employed as switchboard operators, but they faced bias and discrimination in the workplace. Women were often paid lower wages and had limited career advancement opportunities compared to men. However, women also played a crucial role in the industry, and many went on to become leaders and innovators in the field.\n\n###Strikes\n\nThe telephone industry was also marked by labor disputes and strikes, particularly in the early 20th century. Workers demanded better wages, working conditions, and benefits, but management often resisted these demands. The most notable strike was the 1941 telephone strike, which involved over 300,000 workers and was eventually settled through mediation.\n\n##Hawthorne studies\n\nThe Hawthorne studies, conducted in the 1920s and 1930s, were a series of experiments designed to improve worker productivity and job satisfaction. The studies were conducted at Western Electric's Hawthorne Works in Illinois and involved a range of experiments, including changing lighting levels and introducing social variables. The studies found that worker productivity was influenced by a range of factors, including social and psychological factors, and they helped to establish the importance of workplace design and management.\n\n##Employee benefits\n\nThe telephone industry has a long history of providing employee benefits, including health insurance, pensions, and education programs. Many companies, including AT&T, also offered employee stock options and other forms of compensation.\n\n#Users\n\n##Business\n\nBusinesses have been among the earliest and most frequent users of the telephone, using it to communicate with customers, suppliers, and other partners. The telephone has also played a crucial role in the development of modern business practices, including the use of telephones in sales and marketing.\n\n##Housewives\n\nHousewives have also been among the most frequent users of the telephone, using it to communicate with family members, friends, and other household members. The telephone has helped to increase social connections and networking opportunities for housewives, who have also used it to access information and services.\n\n##Gender and culture roles\n\nThe telephone has played a significant role in shaping gender and culture roles, particularly in the early 20th century. Women were often seen as the primary users of the telephone, and were expected to perform household chores and manage the household telephone. However, men also used the telephone for business and social purposes, and the device helped to challenge traditional roles and expectations.\n\n##Telemarketing\n\nTelemarketing has become an increasingly important aspect of the telephone industry, with companies using it to reach customers and promote products and services. Telemarketing has also been the subject of controversy, with some companies accused of using high-pressure sales tactics and making false or misleading claims.\n\n##9-1-1\n\nThe 9-1-1 emergency number has become a ubiquitous part of modern life, with millions of people around the world using it to access emergency services. The 9-1-1 system was introduced in the United States in the 1960s and has since been adopted by many countries around the world.\n\n##Harassing calls\n\nHarassing calls have also become a significant problem in the modern world, with millions of people affected by unwanted or harassing calls. The telephone industry has taken steps to address this issue, including the introduction of caller ID and call-blocking technology.\n\n##Literary fears\n\nThe telephone has also been the subject of literary fears and anxieties, with many authors and writers exploring themes of technology-induced anxiety, alienation, and isolation. The telephone has been portrayed as a source of both connection and disconnection, highlighting the complex and multifaceted nature of human relationships in the modern world.\n\n#See also\n\n* History of the Internet\n* History of Computing\n* Telephone Technology\n* Telecommunications\n* Bell System\n* AT&T\n* United States Communications Act of 1934\n\n#References\n\n(No references are included in this article as per the requirements.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

With a career spanning over three decades, O'Connor has become a household name, known for her powerful voice, thought-provoking lyrics, and unapologetic attitude. This article provides an overview of her life, music, and personal journey, shedding light on her evolution as an artist and a woman.\n\nEarly life and education\n\nSinéad O'Connor was born to John O'Connor, a traveling salesman, and Sean O'Connor, a director of the Irish Blacksmiths Association. She was the eldest of four children born to a deeply Catholic family. O'Connor's early life was marked by her parents' divorce when she was just six years old. She spent much of her childhood moving between her parents' homes, eventually settling with her mother in Dublin.\n\nO'Connor's musical talent was evident from an early age. She began singing in her church choir and later attended Mount Anville Secondary School, where she honed her vocal skills. After completing her secondary education, O'Connor attended the local art college, the Dun Laoghaire Institute of Art, Design and Technology. However, she dropped out to pursue a career in music.\n\nMusic career\n\n### 1980s\n\nO'Connor's music career began in the 1980s, when she joined the Irish band Ton Ton Macoute. The group's lead singer, Fachtna O'Ceallaigh, became a mentor to O'Connor, teaching her the ropes of the music industry. In 1986, O'Connor released her debut single, \" mandinka,\" which gained moderate success. However, it was her second single, \"I Want Your (Hands on Me),\" that brought her widespread attention.\n\n### 1987–1989: The Lion and the Cobra\n\nIn 1987, O'Connor released her debut album, The Lion and the Cobra. The album was a critical and commercial success, thanks in part to her hit single, \"Troy.\" The album's themes of love, relationships, and identity resonated with listeners, establishing O'Connor as a rising star in the music industry.\n\n### 1990–1993: I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got\n\nIn 1990, O'Connor released her second album, I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got. The album was a major breakthrough for the singer, thanks to the massive hit single, \"Nothing Compares 2 U.\" Written by Prince, the song became an anthem for those struggling with grief and loss. The album's success catapulted O'Connor to international stardom, earning her multiple Grammy nominations and a performance at the 1991 Grammy Awards.\n\n#### Saturday Night Live protest\n\nOn October 3, 1992, O'Connor appeared on Saturday Night Live (SNL) to perform a rendition of \"Sunday, Bloody Sunday\" in protest of the Catholic Church's handling of the child abuse scandal. The performance, which featured O'Connor tearing up a photograph of Pope John Paul II, sparked controversy and outrage. The incident marked a turning point in O'Connor's career, as she faced backlash from the Church and some sections of the media.\n\n### 1993–2000\n\nO'Connor's subsequent albums, Am I Not Your Girl? (1992) and Faith and Courage (1994), received mixed reviews and failed to match the success of I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got. However, the singer continued to release critically acclaimed albums, including She Who Dwells in the Secret of God (1997) and Sean-Nós Nua (2002).\n\n### 2000s\n\nThe 2000s saw O'Connor's music career experience a resurgence. She released the album Throw Down Your Arms (2005), a reggae-infused album that explored her Irish roots. The album was a critical success and earned O'Connor a Grammy nomination for Best Traditional Folk Album.\n\n### 2010s\n\nIn the 2010s, O'Connor continued to release critically acclaimed albums, including The Lion and the Cobra (2012) and I'm Not Bossy, I'm the Boss (2014). The singer also made headlines for her outspoken views on politics and her personal life.\n\n### 2020–2023: Memoir and death of son\n\nIn 2020, O'Connor released her memoir, Rememberings, which provided a candid glimpse into her life and career. The book was a critical and commercial success, earning O'Connor a spot on several bestseller lists. However, the year was marred by tragedy when her 17-year-old son, Shane, took his own life. O'Connor has since spoken out about her struggles with mental health and the importance of seeking help.\n\nPersonal life\n\n### Marriages and children\n\nO'Connor has been married four times: to John Waters in 1987, to Nick Sommerlad in 1991, to Steve Cooney in 1996, and to Barry Herridge in 2001. She has four children: Jake, Roisin, Shane, and Yeshua.\n\n### Other relationships\n\nO'Connor has been open about her relationships and has spoken about the challenges she faced in her personal life. In 2014, she released a song, \"Small Man's Heart,\" which was rumored to be about her marriage to Barry Herridge.\n\n### Homes\n\nO'Connor has lived in several countries, including Ireland, the United States, and the United Kingdom. She has been known to divide her time between her homes in Ireland and the United States.\n\n### Sexuality\n\nO'Connor has identified as bisexual and has been open about her experiences with women. In 2018, she released a song, \"The Joke's On Us,\" which addressed her relationships with women.\n\n### Politics\n\nO'Connor has been an outspoken critic of the Catholic Church and has spoken about her views on politics. In 2018, she released a song, \"The Joke's On Us,\" which addressed her experiences with the Church.\n\n### Religion\n\nO'Connor was raised Catholic but has since spoken about her disillusionment with the Church. In 2018, she released a song, \"The Joke's On Us,\" which addressed her experiences with the Church.\n\n### Health\n\nO'Connor has spoken about her struggles with mental health and has advocated for greater awareness and support for those struggling with mental illness.\n\n### Death\n\nO'Connor is still alive and active in her music career.\n\nTributes\n\nO'Connor has been the subject of numerous tributes and accolades throughout her career. In 2018, she was inducted into the Irish Music Hall of Fame. In 2020, she was awarded a honorary doctorate from the University of Limerick.\n\nIn popular culture\n\nO'Connor's music and persona have been referenced in popular culture, including in films, television shows, and music videos. Her song \"Nothing Compares 2 U\" has been covered by numerous artists and has become a staple of popular music.\n\nDiscography\n\n* The Lion and the Cobra (1987)\n* I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got (1990)\n* Am I Not Your Girl?

It is a member of the yew family (Taxaceae) and is one of the most valuable and sought-after species of trees in the world due to its unique characteristics and versatility. This article provides an overview of the discovery of the species, its taxonomy and naming, its role as the type species of the genus _Torreya_, its common names, description, distribution, ecology, extinction threats, conservation actions, and conservation controversies.\n\n**Species Discovery**\n\nThe discovery of _Torreya taxifolia_ is attributed to the early European explorers of the southeastern United States, who were drawn to the region by the promise of gold and other valuable resources. One of the earliest recorded sightings of the species was by Spanish naturalist and explorer Hernando de Soto in the 16th century, who described the tree as having a distinctive nutmeg-like aroma. Over time, the species was hunted extensively for its valuable nuts and seeds, which were used to make medicines, perfumes, and other products.\n\n**Taxonomy and Naming**\n\n_Torreya taxifolia_ is a member of the family Taxaceae, which is a group of coniferous trees that are characterized by their distinctive seeds and cones. The species was first formally described by American botanist John Torrey in 1853, who named it _Torreya taxifolia_ due to its unique leaf and seed characteristics. The species is one of several members of the genus _Torreya_, which includes other species such as _Torreya californica_ and _Torreya floridana_.\n\n**Type Species of Genus Torreya**\n\n_Torreya taxifolia_ is the type species of the genus _Torreya_, which means that it is the species that was used to define the characteristics of the genus. The species was chosen as the type species due to its unique combination of characteristics, including its distinctive leaf shape and seed structure.\n\n**Common Names**\n\n_Torreya taxifolia_ is known by a variety of common names, including Florida nutmeg, mountain nutmeg, and southern nutmeg. The species is also sometimes referred to as the \"nutmeg of the south\" due to its unique nutmeg-like aroma and flavor.\n\n**Description**\n\n**Technical Description**\n\n_Torreya taxifolia_ is a coniferous tree that grows up to 40 feet (12 meters) in height, with a trunk diameter of up to 3 feet (0.9 meters). The tree has a distinctive leaf shape, with needle-like leaves that are arranged in a whorled pattern on the stem. The leaves are dark green in color, with a distinctive waxy texture and a characteristic aroma that is reminiscent of nutmeg.\n\n**Subcanopy Growth Adaptations**\n\n_Torreya taxifolia_ is a subcanopy tree that grows in the understory of larger forests. The species has adapted to this environment by developing a distinctive subcanopy growth habit, with a dense canopy of leaves and a characteristic layered appearance. The tree's growth habit allows it to compete for resources in the understory environment and to thrive in shaded conditions.\n\n**Distribution**\n\n**Wild Population**\n\n_Torreya taxifolia_ is native to the southeastern United States, where it is found in the wild in a variety of habitats, including forests, woodlands, and mountainous regions. The species is most commonly found in the states of Florida, Georgia, and Alabama, where it is often found growing in association with other coniferous trees.\n\n**Prehistoric Distribution**\n\nThe prehistoric distribution of _Torreya taxifolia_ is not well understood, although it is thought to have occurred in a wider range of habitats and regions than it does today. The species is believed to have been present in the southeastern United States during the last ice age, when the climate was cooler and drier than it is today.\n\n**Ecology**\n\n**Habitat**\n\n_Torreya taxifolia_ is a habitat-specialized species that grows in a variety of forest and woodland habitats. The species is most commonly found in areas with rich, well-drained soils and a moderate to high level of moisture.\n\n**Seed Dispersal**\n\n_Torreya taxifolia_ is a species that relies on seed dispersal for reproduction. The seeds are dispersed by a variety of means, including wind, water, and animals. The seeds are also dispersed by humans, who collect and propagate the species for its valuable nuts and seeds.\n\n**Extinction Threats**\n\n**Vulnerabilities of Restricted Range Size**\n\n_Torreya taxifolia_ is a species that is vulnerable to extinction due to its restricted range size. The species is found in a limited area of the southeastern United States, where it is threatened by habitat loss and degradation, as well as by disease and other factors.\n\n**The Die-off Begins**\n\nIn the 1950s, _Torreya taxifolia_ began to experience a die-off, with large numbers of trees collapsing and dying. The die-off was attributed to a combination of factors, including disease, habitat degradation, and climate change.\n\n**The Role of Pathogens in the Die-off**\n\nPathogens, including fungi and bacteria, are believed to have played a significant role in the die-off of _Torreya taxifolia_. The species is susceptible to a variety of pathogens, including stem canker fungi, which can cause significant damage to the tree's vascular system.\n\n**The Role of Habitat Deterioration in the Die-off**\n\nHabitat deterioration is also believed to have contributed to the die-off of _Torreya taxifolia_. The species is adapted to grow in a specific type of habitat, which is characterized by rich, well-drained soils and a moderate to high level of moisture. However, human activities, such as deforestation and development, have led to habitat degradation and the loss of suitable habitats for the species.\n\n**Focus on a Stem Canker Fungus**\n\nOne of the key pathogens involved in the die-off of _Torreya taxifolia_ is a stem canker fungus, which is believed to have been introduced to the species through human activity. The fungus causes significant damage to the tree's vascular system, leading to the collapse and death of the tree.\n\n**Ultimate Cause of Die-off Still Unsolved**\n\nDespite extensive research, the ultimate cause of the die-off of _Torreya taxifolia_ is still not fully understood. The species is thought to be a complex system, and the interactions between different factors, including disease, habitat degradation, and climate change, may be contributing to its decline.\n\n**Conservation Actions**\n\n**Protect Areas in Species Range**\n\nConservation efforts are underway to protect areas in the range of _Torreya taxifolia_. This includes the establishment of nature reserves and protected areas, which provide a safe habitat for the species and allow it to thrive.\n\n**List the Species as Endangered**\n\n_Torreya taxifolia_ has been listed as an endangered species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). This classification recognizes the species as being at high risk of extinction and highlights the need for conservation efforts to protect it.\n\n**In Situ Habitat Improvement**\n\nConservation efforts are also focused on improving the habitat of _Torreya taxifolia_ in situ. This includes activities such as reforestation, habitat restoration, and the removal of invasive species, which can harm the species and its habitat.\n\n**Ex Situ Genetic Safeguarding**\n\nEx situ genetic safeguarding is also an important conservation strategy for _Torreya taxifolia_. This involves the collection and conservation of genetic material from the species, which can be used to breed new individuals and restore populations in the wild.\n\n**Document Early Horticultural Plantings**\n\nEarly horticultural plantings of _Torreya taxifolia_ are being documented and studied to better understand the history of the species and its introduction to new areas. This information can be used to inform conservation efforts and to develop strategies for protecting the species.\n\n**Conservation Controversies**\n\n**Assisted Migration (the Policy Debate)**\n\nAssisted migration, or the intentional movement of species to new areas, is a contentious issue in conservation biology. Some argue that assisted migration can be an effective way to protect species from extinction, while others argue that it can disrupt ecosystems and lead to unintended consequences.\n\n**Management of Seeds Produced Ex Situ**\n\nThe management of seeds produced ex situ is another area of controversy in conservation biology. Some argue that seeds produced ex situ should be used to breed new individuals and restore populations in the wild, while others argue that they should be used for other purposes, such as horticulture and research.\n\n**Seeds Produced from Official Plantings**\n\nSeeds produced from official plantings of _Torreya taxifolia_ are being used for conservation and research purposes. These seeds are being used to breed new individuals and restore populations in the wild, as well as to study the biology and ecology of the species.\n\n**Seeds Accessed by Citizens**\n\nSeeds accessed by citizens are also being used for conservation and research purposes.

The ceremony was attended by dignitaries, royalty, and high-ranking officials from across the Commonwealth.\n\n**Preparation**\n\n### Background\n\nThe coronation preparations began in earnest in 2020, shortly after the death of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, and the accession of Charles III to the throne. The ceremony was planned to be a grand and elaborate affair, with a focus on showcasing British culture and tradition. The Royal Family and their advisors worked closely with the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Dean of Westminster, and other senior clergy to plan the service, which was to be led by the Archbishop of Canterbury.\n\n### Service and Procession\n\nThe coronation service was based on the traditional Order of Service, with some modifications to reflect the changing times and the personal preferences of the new monarch. The service was divided into several key sections, including the procession to the abbey, the recognition of the monarch, the oath and accession declaration, the anointing, the investment and crowning, and the enthronement and homage.\n\n### Guests\n\nThe guest list for the coronation was extensive, with over 2,000 people invited to attend. The list included royalty and dignitaries from across the Commonwealth, as well as high-ranking officials from the British government and the Church of England. The guests were seated in the abbey according to their rank and precedence, with the most senior dignitaries seated closest to the altar.\n\n### Vestments and Crowns\n\nThe coronation ceremony featured a range of elaborate vestments and crowns, designed to reflect the monarch's role and status. Charles III wore a gold and jewel-encrusted crown, while Camilla wore a smaller crown adorned with pearls and diamonds. The Archbishop of Canterbury wore a traditional cope and mitre, while the Dean of Westminster wore a fancy cope and stole.\n\n### Art\n\nThe coronation ceremony featured a range of artistic elements, including stained glass windows, tapestries, and organ music.

Native to the Mediterranean region, it has a wide distribution across the Old World, from Europe to Asia and Africa. This article provides an in-depth look at the characteristics, adaptations, and uses of Anagyris foetida, including its distribution, habitat, pollination, seed dispersal, and medicinal properties.\n\n# Scientific Name\n----------------\n\nAnagyris foetida is the scientific name for this plant species, with \"Anagyris\" derived from the Greek word for \"foetid\" and \"foetida\" meaning \"stinking\" or \"malodorous\".\n\n# Common names\n----------------\n\nAnagyris foetida is known by several common names, including:\n\n* Stinking anagyris\n* Foetid anagyris\n* Stinkweed\n* European anagyris\n* Mediterranean anagyris\n\n# Distribution\n----------------\n\nAnagyris foetida is native to the Mediterranean region, with a wide distribution across Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is found in countries such as Spain, France, Italy, Greece, Turkey, and Egypt, as well as in parts of North Africa and the Middle East.\n\n# Habitat\n---------\n\nAnagyris foetida grows in a variety of habitats, including dry scrublands, rocky outcrops, and sandy soils. It is often found in areas with full sun and well-drained soil, and can tolerate a range of soil types, from acidic to alkaline.\n\n# Adaptations to growth in Winter and early Spring\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n## Summer leaf-fall\n\nAnagyris foetida is a deciduous plant, with leaves that fall in the summer months. This allows the plant to conserve water and energy during the dry summer period, and to regrow new leaves in the autumn.\n\n## Pollination by birds\n\nAnagyris foetida is pollinated by birds, particularly species of finches and sparrows. The plant produces nectar-rich flowers that attract these birds, which in turn transfer pollen from one plant to another.\n\n# Seed dispersal\n----------------\n\nAnagyris foetida has a complex seed dispersal system, involving several different vectors.\n\n## Soil seed banks\n\nThe seeds of Anagyris foetida can remain dormant in the soil for many years, forming a seed bank that can germinate in response to favorable conditions.\n\n## Olive mimicry\n\nThe seeds of Anagyris foetida are similar in shape and color to olive stones, which can lead to accidental ingestion by humans and animals.\n\n## Role of sheep\n\nSheep can play a role in seed dispersal by ingesting the seeds of Anagyris foetida and depositing them in new locations, often in their dung.\n\n## Other possible mammalian and avian vectors\n\nOther mammals, such as deer and rodents, may also play a role in seed dispersal, as may birds and other animals that ingest the seeds.\n\n## Unknown seed dispersal vector\n\nThe exact mechanisms of seed dispersal for Anagyris foetida are not fully understood, and further research is needed to determine the relative importance of different vectors.\n\n## Tough, waterproof seed coats\n\nThe seeds of Anagyris foetida have tough, waterproof coats that help to protect them from desiccation and other environmental stresses.\n\n# Value as a nitrogen-fixing pioneer and companion plant\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnagyris foetida has been used as a nitrogen-fixing pioneer plant, helping to improve soil fertility and structure. It can also be used as a companion plant to improve the growth and health of other crops.\n\n# Medicinal use\n----------------\n\nAnagyris foetida has been used in traditional medicine for a range of purposes, including as a treatment for digestive problems and as a diuretic.\n\n# Toxicity\n------------\n\nAnagyris foetida contains a range of toxic compounds, including alkaloids and glycosides. These compounds can cause a range of symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.\n\n## Alkaloid anagyrine a cause of birth defects\n\nThe alkaloid anagyrine, found in Anagyris foetida, has been shown to cause birth defects in laboratory animals.\n\n## Danger to children\n\nChildren are particularly vulnerable to the toxic effects of Anagyris foetida, and should be kept away from the plant.\n\n## Hazardous tainting of milk products\n\nAnagyris foetida can taint milk products, making them unsuitable for consumption.\n\n## Case of accidental poisoning in Algeria\n\nA case of accidental poisoning by Anagyris foetida was reported in Algeria, highlighting the potential risks associated with the plant.\n\n# Cultural references: Anagyris and Anagyrous\n------------------------------------------------\n\n## Lysistrata\n\nThe character of Anagyris is mentioned in the ancient Greek comedy Lysistrata, written by Aristophanes.\n\n## Persistence of name\n\nThe name \"Anagyris\" has persisted in use for centuries, reflecting the plant's importance in ancient Greek culture.\n\n# Gallery\n---------\n\n## Anagyris foetida\n\nAn image of Anagyris foetida in flower.\n\n## Avian pollinators\n\nAn image of birds pollinating Anagyris foetida.\n\n## Avian nectar thief\n\nAn image of a bird stealing nectar from Anagyris foetida.\n\n## Insect pollinators\n\nAn image of insects pollinating Anagyris foetida.\n\n# See also\n--------------\n\n* Fabaceae\n* Mediterranean region\n* Nitrogen-fixing plants\n* Traditional medicine\n* Toxic plants", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

Founded in 2009, the company has gained significant attention for its innovative approach to deep-sea exploration and its commitment to raising awareness about ocean conservation.\n\n#Background\n\nOceanGate's mission is to advance human knowledge and exploration of the world's oceans while promoting conservation and sustainability. The company's founders, Stockton Rush and Guillermo Söhnlein, were inspired by the vastness and mysteries of the ocean and saw an opportunity to create a new industry that combined cutting-edge technology with adventure and education.\n\n#History\n\n##2009–2013: Founding and acquisition of Antipodes\n\nOceanGate was founded in 2009 by Stockton Rush, a successful entrepreneur with a background in finance, and Guillermo Söhnlein, a skilled engineer with experience in underwater exploration. The company's early focus was on developing a submersible capable of reaching great depths without sacrificing comfort and safety. In 2010, OceanGate acquired Antipodes, a submersible designed by Söhnlein, which became the company's first operational vessel.\n\nAntipodes was a significant step forward in submersible technology, featuring a unique design that allowed it to withstand the pressures of the deep ocean while providing a spacious and comfortable environment for passengers. The submersible's maiden voyage took place in 2011, and it quickly gained a reputation for its reliability and performance.\n\n##2013–2016: Construction of Cyclops and Söhnlein's departure\n\nIn 2013, OceanGate began construction on its second submersible, Cyclops 1. Designed to be even more advanced than Antipodes, Cyclops 1 featured a new hull design and improved life support systems. However, the project was not without its challenges, and Söhnlein's departure from the company in 2014 caused significant disruption to the development process.\n\nDespite the setback, OceanGate continued to work on Cyclops 1, and the submersible was finally completed in 2016. Its maiden voyage took place later that year, and it quickly established itself as one of the most advanced submersibles in the world.\n\n##2016–2023: Expansion of fleet and dives to the Titanic\n\nIn the years following the completion of Cyclops 1, OceanGate expanded its fleet to include a range of submersibles designed for different purposes. The company also began to focus on deep-sea exploration, with a particular emphasis on the wreck of the Titanic.\n\nIn 2019, OceanGate sent a team of explorers to the Titanic wreck site, where they spent several days conducting research and gathering data. The expedition was a significant success, and it highlighted the importance of deep-sea exploration in advancing our understanding of the ocean and its many mysteries.\n\n##2023: Implosion of Titan and death of Rush\n\nIn 2023, OceanGate sent a team of explorers to the Titanic wreck site aboard its newest submersible, Titan. Tragically, the submersible imploded on the descent, resulting in the loss of all lives on board, including Stockton Rush.\n\nThe incident was a devastating blow to the OceanGate community, and it raised questions about the safety and reliability of the company's submersibles. However, the company has vowed to continue its work, and it has established a new team to investigate the causes of the incident and to develop new safety protocols.\n\n#Submersibles\n\n##Antipodes\n\nAntipodes is a submersible designed by Guillermo Söhnlein and developed by OceanGate. The submersible features a unique hull design that allows it to withstand the pressures of the deep ocean while providing a spacious and comfortable environment for passengers.\n\nAntipodes was the first operational submersible of OceanGate, and it played a significant role in the company's early success. The submersible's maiden voyage took place in 2011, and it quickly gained a reputation for its reliability and performance.\n\n##Cyclops 1\n\nCyclops 1 is a submersible designed and developed by OceanGate. The submersible features a new hull design and improved life support systems, making it one of the most advanced submersibles in the world.\n\nCyclops 1 was completed in 2016, and its maiden voyage took place later that year. The submersible has since established itself as a leading vessel in the field of deep-sea exploration, and it has been used for a range of scientific and educational purposes.\n\n##Titan\n\nTitan is a submersible designed and developed by OceanGate. The submersible features a range of advanced technologies, including a new hull design and improved life support systems.\n\nTitan was completed in 2023, and it was used for a number of deep-sea expeditions, including a dive to the Titanic wreck site. However, the submersible imploded on the descent, resulting in the loss of all lives on board.\n\n#Associated entities\n\nOceanGate is associated with a range of entities, including:\n\n* The OceanGate Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to advancing ocean conservation and sustainability\n* The OceanGate Institute, a research organization focused on the study of the ocean and its many mysteries\n* A range of educational institutions and research organizations, with which OceanGate collaborates on a range of projects and initiatives.\n\n#See also\n\n* Deep-sea exploration\n* Ocean conservation\n* Submersible technology\n* Titanic wreck site\n\n#References\n\nThis article does not include any references.\n\n#Further reading\n\n* OceanGate's website, which provides a wealth of information on the company and its activities\n* The OceanGate Foundation's website, which provides information on the organization's mission and activities\n* The OceanGate Institute's website, which provides information on the research organization's focus and activities.\n\n#External links\n\n* OceanGate's website: [www.oceangate.com](http://www.oceangate.com)\n* The OceanGate Foundation's website: [www.oceangatefoundation.org](http://www.oceangatefoundation.org)\n* The OceanGate Institute's website: [www.oceangateinstitute.org](http://www.oceangateinstitute.org)", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The invasion has had significant regional and global implications, affecting international relations, economic systems, and the lives of millions of people.\n\n**Background**\n\n**Post-Soviet Relations**\n\nFollowing the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine and Russia maintained complex and often contentious relations. Ukraine, which had been a Soviet republic, sought to establish its independence and sovereignty, while Russia continued to exert influence over its former territories. The relationship between the two countries was marked by periodic tensions, including disputes over energy supplies, border demarcations, and economic cooperation.\n\n**Ukrainian Revolution, Russian Intervention in Crimea and Donbas**\n\nIn 2014, Ukraine experienced a revolution that led to the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych, who had signed an association agreement with the European Union but then switched to a close relationship with Russia. The revolution was followed by a period of instability and conflict in eastern Ukraine, where Russian-backed separatists took control of several regions, including Donetsk and Luhansk. Russia annexed Crimea in March 2014, sparking international condemnation and economic sanctions.\n\n**Prelude**\n\n**Putin's Invasion Announcement**\n\nOn February 24, 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a \"special military operation\" in Ukraine, citing the need to protect Russian-speaking populations and to demilitarize the country. The announcement marked the beginning of a large-scale invasion, which involved ground troops, air strikes, and cyber attacks. Putin's announcement was met with widespread international condemnation, and the United States and European Union imposed severe economic sanctions on Russia.\n\n**Events**\n\n**Initial Invasion (24 February – 7 April)**\n\nThe initial invasion focused on several key areas, including:\n\n### **Kyiv and Northern Front**\n\nRussian forces advanced on the capital city of Kyiv, but were met with fierce resistance from Ukrainian forces. The city's suburbs and outskirts were contested, with heavy fighting and civilian casualties.\n\n### **Northeastern Front**\n\nRussian forces invaded the northeastern region of Sumy, where they clashed with Ukrainian troops and local militias.\n\n### **Southern Front**\n\nRussian forces advanced on the southern city of Kherson, which they eventually captured. The city became a key stronghold for Russian forces in the region.\n\n### **Eastern Front**\n\nRussian forces focused on the Donbas region, where they clashed with Ukrainian separatists and government forces. The city of Mariupol was besieged and eventually fell to Russian forces.\n\n**Southeastern Front (8 April – 5 September)**\n\nThe southeastern front saw significant gains for Russian forces, including:\n\n### **Fall of Mariupol**\n\nIn May 2022, Mariupol fell to Russian forces, marking a significant victory for the invaders.\n\n### **Fall of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk**\n\nIn July 2022, Russian forces captured the cities of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk, which controlled access to the Donbas region.\n\n### **Kharkiv Front**\n\nIn August 2022, Russian forces launched a counterattack in the Kharkiv region, but were repelled by Ukrainian forces.\n\n### **Kherson-Mykolaiv Front**\n\nIn September 2022, Russian forces launched a counterattack in the Kherson-Mykolaiv region, but were repelled by Ukrainian forces.\n\n### **Zaporizhzhia Front**\n\nIn September 2022, Russian forces captured the city of Zaporizhzhia, which controlled access to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant.\n\n**Russian Annexations and Occupation Losses (6 September – 11 November 2022)**\n\nOn September 30, 2022, Russia annexed the Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts, which were largely under Russian control. However, the annexations were widely condemned by the international community, and the invasion continued.\n\n**Winter Stalemate, Attrition Campaign and Military Surge (12 November 2022 – 7 June 2023)**\n\nThe winter months saw a stalemate in the conflict, with both sides suffering heavy losses. However, in February 2023, Russia launched a military surge, which saw significant gains in the Bakhmut region.\n\n**2023 Counteroffensives and Summer Campaign (8 June 2023 – 1 December 2023)**\n\nIn June 2023, Ukraine launched a series of counteroffensives, which saw significant gains in the Kharkiv and Donetsk regions. The summer months saw a surge in fighting, with both sides suffering heavy losses.\n\n**Russian Spring and Summer Campaigns and Ukrainian Incursion (1 December 2023 – present)**\n\nIn December 2023, Russia launched a new campaign in the Donbas region, which saw significant gains for Russian forces. However, Ukraine has also launched a new incursion into Russian-controlled territory, which has seen significant resistance from Russian forces.\n\n**Battlespaces**\n\n**Command**\n\nThe Russian invasion has been led by a combination of military leaders, including:\n\n* General Valery Gerasimov, Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces\n* General Alexander Dvornikov, Commander of the Russian forces in Ukraine\n* General Sergei Surovikin, Commander of the Russian Aerospace Forces\n\n**Missile Attacks and Aerial Warfare**\n\nThe Russian invasion has seen significant use of missile attacks and aerial warfare, including:\n\n* Cruise missiles launched from Russian warships and submarines\n* Ballistic missiles launched from Russian strategic bombers\n* Fighter jets and attack aircraft launched from Russian air bases\n\n**Crimea Attacks**\n\nThe Russian invasion has seen significant attacks on Ukrainian targets in Crimea, including:\n\n* Missile strikes on Ukrainian military bases\n* Aerial attacks on Ukrainian military aircraft\n* Cyber attacks on Ukrainian military command systems\n\n**Russian Attacks Against Ukrainian Civilian Infrastructure**\n\nThe Russian invasion has seen significant attacks on Ukrainian civilian infrastructure, including:\n\n* Missile strikes on Ukrainian cities and towns\n* Aerial attacks on Ukrainian civilian aircraft\n* Cyber attacks on Ukrainian civilian infrastructure systems\n\n**Naval Blockade and Engagements**\n\nThe Russian invasion has seen a significant naval blockade of Ukrainian ports, including:\n\n* A blockade of the port city of Odessa\n* A blockade of the port city of Mykolaiv\n* Engagements between Russian warships and Ukrainian naval vessels\n\n**Nuclear Risk**\n\nThe Russian invasion has raised significant concerns about the risk of nuclear conflict, including:\n\n* The deployment of Russian nuclear-capable aircraft to Ukraine\n* The deployment of Russian nuclear-capable missiles to Ukraine\n* The possibility of a nuclear response to a Ukrainian counterattack\n\n**Ukrainian Resistance**\n\nThe Russian invasion has seen significant resistance from Ukrainian forces, including:\n\n* Infantry and armored units fighting in the Donbas region\n* Special forces units conducting sabotage and reconnaissance missions\n* Cyber units conducting cyber attacks against Russian command systems\n\n**International Aspects**\n\n**Reactions**\n\nThe Russian invasion has sparked widespread international condemnation, including:\n\n* Economic sanctions imposed by the United States and European Union\n* Diplomatic condemnations from the G7 and other international organizations\n* Humanitarian aid provided to Ukraine by international organizations and governments\n\n**Foreign Involvement**\n\nThe Russian invasion has seen significant foreign involvement, including:\n\n* Military aid provided to Ukraine by the United States and other countries\n* Diplomatic support provided to Ukraine by the European Union and other international organizations\n* Economic sanctions imposed on Russia by the United States and European Union\n\n**Support for Ukraine**\n\nThe Russian invasion has seen significant support for Ukraine from international organizations and governments, including:\n\n* Military aid provided to Ukraine by the United States and other countries\n* Diplomatic support provided to Ukraine by the European Union and other international organizations\n* Humanitarian aid provided to Ukraine by international organizations and governments\n\n**Support for Russia**\n\nThe Russian invasion has seen significant support for Russia from some international organizations and governments, including:\n\n* Diplomatic support provided to Russia by China and other international organizations\n* Economic support provided to Russia by China and other countries\n* Military aid provided to Russia by China and other countries\n\n**Casualties**\n\nThe Russian invasion has seen significant casualties, including:\n\n* Over 100,000 Ukrainian military personnel killed or wounded\n* Over 10,000 Russian military personnel killed or wounded\n* Thousands of civilian casualties, including deaths and injuries\n\n**Prisoners of War**\n\nThe Russian invasion has seen significant numbers of prisoners of war, including:\n\n* Over 10,000 Ukrainian military personnel taken prisoner by Russian forces\n* Over 1,000 Russian military personnel taken prisoner by Ukrainian forces\n\n**War Crimes and Attacks on Civilians**\n\nThe Russian invasion has seen significant allegations of war crimes and attacks on civilians, including:\n\n* Allegations of torture and mistreatment of Ukrainian prisoners of war\n* Allegations of attacks on civilian infrastructure, including homes and hospitals\n* Allegations of fo", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

Sammy's older sister, Reggie, is a rebellious teenager who is trying to find her place in the world.\n\nSammy's love of filmmaking begins when he is a young boy, and he becomes fascinated with the movies that he sees at the local cinema. He starts to make his own films, using his family as actors and a makeshift camera to capture his stories. As Sammy grows older, he becomes more confident in his abilities as a filmmaker, and he begins to make more complex and ambitious films.\n\nHowever, Sammy's parents are not supportive of his film-making hobby, and they see it as a waste of time. They encourage Sammy to focus on his studies and to pursue a more conventional career. Sammy's sister, Reggie, is also not supportive of his film-making, and she sees it as a phase that he will eventually outgrow.\n\nAs Sammy grows older, he begins to face challenges and rejections in his pursuit of filmmaking. He is rejected by a prestigious film school, and he is told that he is not good enough to be a filmmaker. However, despite these setbacks, Sammy remains determined to pursue his dream, and he continues to make films.\n\n**Cast**\n\nThe film features a talented cast of actors, including:\n\n* Gabriel LaBelle as Sammy Fabelman\n* Michelle Williams as Mitzi Fabelman\n* Paul Dano as Burt Fabelman\n* Julia Butters as Reggie Fabelman\n* Mateo Zoryan Francis-DeFord as Nathan\n* Julia Butters as Reggie Fabelman\n* Robin Bartlett as Helen\n* David Dorfman as Boris\n\n**Production**\n\n### Development\n\nThe film was first conceived by Spielberg in the early 2020s. He began working on the script, which was inspired by his own childhood experiences as a young boy growing up in Chicago. Spielberg has said that he drew inspiration from his own family and his own experiences with filmmaking to create the story.\n\n### Writing\n\nSpielberg wrote the screenplay for the film, which was a labor of love for him. He has said that he spent many hours working on the script, trying to get it just right. The screenplay was eventually completed, and the film began production in the summer of 2021.\n\n### Pre-production\n\nPre-production on the film began in the spring of 2021. Spielberg and his team spent several months preparing for the shoot, scouting locations and casting actors. The film was shot on location in Chicago and its surrounding suburbs.\n\n### Casting\n\nThe casting process for the film was extensive, with Spielberg holding open casting calls for many of the roles.
