Born on February 15, 1942, in London, England, Johns began his career in the music industry in the late 1950s and went on to become one of the most respected and sought-after producers of his generation.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nJohns grew up in a musical family and was exposed to a wide range of music from an early age. His father, Pete Johns, was a musician who worked as a session player and a music teacher. Glyn's mother, Violet, was a singer who performed in local music halls. Johns' early interest in music was encouraged by his parents, who provided him with a piano and a guitar. He began taking piano lessons at the age of eight and soon became proficient in playing the instrument.\n\n**Career in Music and Recording**\n\n#### Early Years: 1959–1963\n\nJohns' first job in the music industry was as a messenger at EMI's Abbey Road Studios in London. In 1959, he began working as a tea boy and a porter at the studio, where he was exposed to many of the top recording artists of the time. In 1961, Johns started working as a tape operator at IBC Studios, where he became familiar with the recording process and began to develop his skills as a recording engineer.\n\n**IBC Studios and as Performing Artist**\n\nDuring his time at IBC Studios, Johns also began working as a performing artist, playing guitar and singing in various bands. He joined a band called the Midnighters, which played gigs in and around London. Johns' experience as a performer helped him understand the recording process from the artist's perspective and informed his approach to producing music.\n\n**The Rolling Stones 1962–1963**\n\nIn 1962, Johns began working as a recording engineer for the Rolling Stones, who were then a relatively unknown band. He worked on several of their early recordings, including their debut single, \"Come On,\" which was released in 1963. Johns' work with the Stones helped him develop his skills as a producer and introduced him to the band's guitarist, Keith Richards.\n\n**As Engineer for Shel Talmy**\n\nIn 1963, Johns left IBC Studios and began working as an engineer for Shel Talmy, a British producer who had a successful career working with artists such as the Kinks and the Who. Johns worked on several of Talmy's productions, including the Kinks' debut single, \"Long Tall Sally,\" and the Who's debut single, \"I Can't Explain.\"\n\n#### Peak Years: 1964–1984\n\n**The Kinks, the Who, and Eric Clapton and as Independent**\n\nIn 1964, Johns began working as an independent producer, producing albums for artists such as the Kinks, the Who, and Eric Clapton. He produced the Kinks' album \"A Well Respected Man,\" which was released in 1965. Johns' work with the Kinks helped him develop his skills as a producer and introduced him to the band's lead singer, Ray Davies.\n\n**The Rolling Stones 1965–1975**\n\nIn 1965, Johns began working with the Rolling Stones again, producing several of their albums, including \"December's Children\" and \"Their Satanic Majesties Request.\" He worked closely with the band's guitarist, Keith Richards, to develop their sound and helped shape their music during this period.\n\n**The Small Faces, the Faces, Humble Pie, and Ronnie Lane and Pete Townshend**\n\nIn the late 1960s, Johns began working with other notable bands, including the Small Faces, the Faces, Humble Pie, and Ronnie Lane and Pete Townshend.

He produced several albums for these bands, including the Steve Miller Band's album \"Fly Like an Eagle,\" which was released in 1976.\n\n**Other American Acts**\n\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, Johns began working with other American acts, including Joan Armatrading and the Clash. He produced several albums for these artists, including Joan Armatrading's album \"Show Some Emotion,\" which was released in 1977.\n\n**1985–present**\n\nIn the 1980s, Johns continued to work as a producer, working with artists such as the Clash and the Pretenders. He also began to focus on his own music, releasing several albums, including the album \"Glyn Johns,\" which was released in 1984.\n\n**Approach to Recording**\n\nJohns' approach to recording is centered on creating a live, spontaneous sound. He believes that the best recordings are those that capture the energy and emotion of a live performance. To achieve this, Johns often uses a minimum of overdubs and relies on the musicians to deliver high-quality performances in the studio.\n\n**Family**\n\nJohns is married to a British artist, Kathy, and has two children, a son, and a daughter. His son, Ethan, is a musician who has worked with several notable bands, including the Who and the Rolling Stones. His daughter, Hannah, is a visual artist who has exhibited her work in several galleries.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nJohns' legacy as a producer and engineer is undeniably significant.

Forming in the western Pacific Ocean, the storm made landfall in the Philippines, where it caused significant damage and loss of life. Doksuri then continued to move northward, affecting Taiwan and China before dissipating in the northern part of the latter country.\n\nMeteorological History\n---------------------\n\nTyphoon Doksuri originated from a tropical disturbance that formed over the western Pacific Ocean on September 14, 2017. The system gradually intensified as it moved westward, eventually developing into a tropical depression on September 17. The depression continued to strengthen, and by September 18, it had become a tropical storm, with maximum sustained winds of 65 km/h (40 mph) and a minimum central pressure of 1000 hPa. The storm was named Doksuri by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), which is responsible for assigning names to tropical cyclones in the western Pacific.\n\nOver the next few days, Typhoon Doksuri continued to intensify, with its maximum sustained winds increasing to 130 km/h (80 mph) by September 20. The storm's central pressure also decreased to 950 hPa, indicating a strong and organized system. On September 21, Doksuri made landfall in the Philippines, bringing with it strong winds and heavy rainfall.\n\nPreparations\n------------\n\n### Philippines\n\nThe Philippine government issued a state of calamity in anticipation of the storm's landfall. The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) activated its emergency operations center and deployed personnel to affected areas. The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) issued warnings and advisories to the public, recommending evacuation and preparations for the storm.\n\n### Taiwan\n\nThe Taiwanese government also issued warnings and advisories as Doksuri approached. The Central Weather Bureau (CWB) warned of strong winds, heavy rainfall, and rough seas. The Taiwanese military was placed on high alert, and evacuation orders were issued for low-lying areas.\n\n### China\n\nThe Chinese government issued a red alert for Typhoon Doksuri, indicating a high level of threat to the country. The National Meteorological Center (NMC) warned of strong winds, heavy rainfall, and potential landslides. The Chinese military was deployed to affected areas, and evacuation orders were issued for low-lying areas.\n\nImpact\n------\n\n### Philippines\n\nTyphoon Doksuri brought widespread flooding to the Philippines, particularly in the eastern provinces of Albay and Sorsogon. The storm's strong winds and heavy rainfall caused significant damage to homes, infrastructure, and agriculture. The city of Legazpi was particularly affected, with widespread flooding and landslides reported.\n\n#### Widespread Flooding\n\nThe storm surge from Typhoon Doksuri flooded several coastal towns and cities in the Philippines. The city of Legazpi was heavily flooded, with waters reaching as high as 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) in some areas. The flooding caused significant damage to homes, businesses, and infrastructure.\n\n#### MB Aya Express\n\nThe MB Aya Express, a passenger ferry, sank in the waters off the coast of Albay province due to strong winds and rough seas. The incident resulted in the loss of several lives.\n\n### Taiwan\n\nTyphoon Doksuri brought strong winds and heavy rainfall to Taiwan, causing significant damage to homes, infrastructure, and agriculture. The storm's strong winds also caused power outages in several areas.\n\n### China\n\nTyphoon Doksuri made landfall in the eastern province of Fujian, bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall to the region. The storm's impact was felt in several provinces, including Fujian, Jiangxi, and Guangdong.\n\n#### Fujian\n\nThe city of Fuzhou was particularly affected by the storm, with widespread flooding and power outages reported. The storm's strong winds also caused significant damage to homes, infrastructure, and agriculture.\n\n#### Beijing, Jilin and Hebei\n\nThe storm's impact was also felt in the northern provinces of Beijing, Jilin, and Hebei. Strong winds and heavy rainfall caused significant damage to homes, infrastructure, and agriculture.\n\n### Vietnam\n\nTyphoon Doksuri made landfall in the northern province of Quang Ninh, bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall to the region. The storm's impact was felt in several provinces, including Quang Ninh, Ha Long, and Thai Nguyen.\n\nAftermath\n---------\n\n### China\n\nThe aftermath of Typhoon Doksuri saw significant losses in China. The storm's impact was estimated to be around 10 billion yuan (1.4 billion USD), with widespread damage to homes, infrastructure, and agriculture reported.\n\n#### National Losses\n\nThe storm caused significant losses to the Chinese economy, with the country's gross domestic product (GDP) taking a hit. The Chinese government also faced criticism for its handling of the disaster, with many accusing the authorities of not taking sufficient measures to prepare for the storm.\n\nRetirement\n----------\n\nTyphoon Doksuri was not retired by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) due to its relatively low impact on the region. However, the storm's name was retired by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) due to its strong impact on the country.\n\nSee Also\n--------\n\n* List of typhoons in the Philippines\n* List of typhoons in Taiwan\n* List of typhoons in China\n* List of deadliest tropical cyclones\n\nNotes\n-----\n\n* This article is based on information from various sources, including news articles, government reports, and official records.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n* None\n\nExternal Links\n---------------\n\n* Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) Typhoon Doksuri page\n* National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) Typhoon Doksuri page\n* Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) Typhoon Doksuri page\n* Chinese government's Typhoon Doksuri page", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The election was the third presidential and the eighth parliamentary election held in Serbia since the country's transition to democracy.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe electoral process was preceded by a series of events that shaped the political landscape of the country. Some of the key background events include:\n\n### **Inter-party dialogues on electoral conditions**\n\nIn the months leading up to the election, the government and opposition parties engaged in a series of inter-party dialogues aimed at agreeing on electoral conditions and the framework for the election. The talks were facilitated by the European Union, which had been a key player in the country's democratization process. The talks resulted in an agreement on the electoral system, the composition of the electoral lists, and the format of the debates.\n\n### **Constitutional referendum**\n\nIn 2021, the government proposed a constitutional referendum aimed at amending the Constitution to increase the number of seats in the National Assembly and introduce the use of proportional representation in the election. The referendum was seen as an attempt to consolidate the government's power and reduce the influence of opposition parties. However, the opposition parties rejected the proposal, arguing that it would undermine the democratic process.\n\n### **Environmental protests**\n\nIn the months leading up to the election, Serbia experienced a series of environmental protests, sparked by concerns over air and water pollution, deforestation, and the construction of new infrastructure projects. The protests were led by a coalition of civil society organizations, opposition parties, and environmental groups. The government responded to the protests by promising to take measures to address the environmental concerns, but the protests continued to escalate in the run-up to the election.\n\n**Electoral system**\n\nThe 2022 Serbian general election was held under a proportional representation system, with a minimum threshold of 5% required for a party to gain seats in the National Assembly. The electoral system was designed to ensure that smaller parties had a greater representation in the assembly, but the threshold was seen as a barrier to entry for new parties.\n\n### **Political parties**\n\nA total of 29 political parties and coalitions participated in the election, including:\n\n* **Serbian Progressive Party (SNS)**: The ruling party, led by Aleksandar Vučić\n* **Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS)**: A left-wing party, led by Ivica Dačić\n* **Alliance of Vojvodina Hungarians (VMSZ)**: A party representing the interests of the Hungarian minority in Vojvodina\n* **Serbian Radical Party (SRS)**: A right-wing party, led by Vojislav Šešelj\n* **United for the Victory of Serbia (USS)**: A coalition of smaller parties and independent candidates\n* **National Democratic Alternative (NDA)**: A liberal party, led by Goran Knežević\n* **Serbian Party Oathkeepers (SDP)**: A party advocating for the protection of Serbian national interests\n* **Justice and Reconciliation Party (SPO)**: A left-wing party, led by Srđan Dabiž\n* **We Must (Mišo)**: A party advocating for the rights of the Roma minority\n* **Sovereignists (Suverenisti)**: A party advocating for the sovereignty of Serbia\n* **Dveri–POKS (Dveri–POKS)**: A coalition of smaller parties and independent candidates\n* **Vojvodinians (Vojvođani)**: A party advocating for the rights of the people of Vojvodina\n* **SDS–Nova (SDS–Nova)**: A coalition of the Serbian Democratic Party and the Nova party\n* **Others**: A number of smaller parties and independent candidates\n\n**Pre-election composition**\n\nThe National Assembly had 250 seats before the election, with the Serbian Progressive Party holding 150 seats, the Socialist Party of Serbia holding 16 seats, and the Alliance of Vojvodina Hungarians holding 9 seats. The remaining seats were held by smaller parties and independent candidates.\n\n**Electoral lists**\n\nThe electoral lists were designed to ensure that smaller parties had a greater representation in the National Assembly.

Jackson Women's Health Organization\n\nDobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization is a landmark United States Supreme Court case that was decided on June 24, 2022. The case centered on the constitutionality of a Mississippi law that banned most abortions after 15 weeks of gestation, and it had significant implications for the future of reproductive rights in the United States.\n\nBackground\n\n### Common law\n\nUnder common law, the right to an abortion was not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution. However, the Supreme Court had previously recognized a constitutional right to privacy in the 1965 case of Griswold v. Connecticut, which relied on the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. This right was later expanded to include a woman's right to have an abortion in the 1973 case of Roe v. Wade.\n\n### Constitutional right\n\nThe Roe v. Wade decision established that a woman's right to an abortion was a fundamental right protected by the Constitution. The decision held that the right to an abortion was a matter of personal liberty and that governments could not prohibit a woman from having an abortion before fetal viability (approximately 24 weeks of gestation). The decision also established a trimester framework, which allowed for more restrictions on abortion in the third trimester.\n\n### Evolution of the composition of the Supreme Court\n\nOver the years, the composition of the Supreme Court has changed, with several justices retiring or being appointed by new presidents. In 2020, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg passed away, and President Donald Trump nominated Amy Coney Barrett to replace her. Barrett was confirmed by the Senate in October 2020, and her appointment gave conservatives a 6-3 majority on the Court.\n\nGestational Age Act\n\n### Lower courts\n\nThe Gestational Age Act, passed in 2018, prohibited most abortions after 15 weeks of gestation. The law was challenged in federal court by the Jackson Women's Health Organization, a medical center that provided abortion services in Mississippi. The district court upheld the law, but the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals struck it down, ruling that it was unconstitutional.\n\nSupreme Court\n\n### Oral argument\n\nThe case was appealed to the Supreme Court, which heard oral argument on December 1, 2021. The justices asked questions about the meaning of fetal viability, the constitutionality of the law, and the impact of the law on women's health.\n\n### Leaked draft opinion\n\nIn May 2022, a draft opinion in the case was leaked to the press. The draft opinion, written by Justice Samuel Alito, indicated that the Court was likely to overturn Roe v. Wade. The leak sparked widespread controversy and was widely seen as a breach of trust within the Court.\n\n#### Reactions\n\nThe leak was condemned by Chief Justice John Roberts, who called it an \"egregious breach of trust.\" The leak also sparked a wave of protests and demonstrations across the country, as abortion rights activists expressed their opposition to the draft opinion.\n\n#### Investigation\n\nThe Court conducted an investigation into the leak, but it did not release any findings.\n\n### Opinions\n\nOn June 24, 2022, the Supreme Court issued its decision in the case. The majority opinion, written by Justice Alito, held that the Gestational Age Act was constitutional and that the right to an abortion was not a fundamental right protected by the Constitution.\n\n#### Majority opinion\n\nJustice Alito's opinion argued that the right to an abortion was not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution and that it was not a fundamental right protected by the Due Process Clause. The opinion also argued that the trimester framework established in Roe v. Wade was no longer relevant and that the Court should no longer recognize a constitutional right to an abortion.\n\n#### Concurrences\n\nJustices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch concurred in the judgment, but wrote separate opinions. Justice Thomas argued that the Court should go further and overturn Griswold v. Connecticut, which recognized a constitutional right to privacy. Justice Gorsuch argued that the Court should recognize a right to abortion, but only up to the point of fetal viability.\n\n#### Concurrence in judgment\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh concurred in the judgment, but wrote a separate opinion. Justice Kavanaugh argued that the Court should recognize a right to abortion, but only in limited circumstances.\n\n#### Dissent\n\nJustices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan dissented from the majority opinion. The dissenting justices argued that the right to an abortion was a fundamental right protected by the Constitution and that the Court should not have overturned Roe v. Wade.\n\nImpact\n\n### Pre-decision\n\nPrior to the decision, several states had passed laws restricting access to abortion. These laws included requirements that abortion providers have admitting privileges at local hospitals, that patients undergo ultrasound screenings before having an abortion, and that abortion providers provide patients with information about the development of their fetuses.\n\n### Post-decision\n\nThe decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization has had significant implications for reproductive rights in the United States. Many states have passed laws restricting access to abortion, and several have effectively banned the procedure altogether. The decision has also led to a wave of protests and demonstrations across the country, as abortion rights activists express their opposition to the decision.\n\n### State laws restricting abortion\n\nSeveral states have passed laws restricting access to abortion, including Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and West Virginia. These laws include requirements that abortion providers have admitting privileges at local hospitals, that patients undergo ultrasound screenings before having an abortion, and that abortion providers provide patients with information about the development of their fetuses.\n\n#### EMTALA and federal preemption\n\nThe Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) requires hospitals to provide emergency care to patients who are experiencing a medical emergency. However, some states have passed laws that exempt abortion providers from EMTALA requirements, arguing that abortion is not a medical emergency. This has led to controversy and debate about the status of abortion as a medical emergency.\n\n### State laws expanding abortion access\n\nSeveral states have passed laws expanding access to abortion, including California, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington. These laws include requirements that insurance plans cover abortion, that abortion providers have admitting privileges at local hospitals, and that patients have access to abortion counseling and services.\n\n### Congressional proposals\n\nCongress has proposed several laws aimed at restricting access to abortion, including the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which would ban abortion after 20 weeks of gestation. However, these proposals have been met with opposition from abortion rights advocates and have not been passed into law.\n\n### Executive action by President Biden\n\nPresident Biden has taken several executive actions aimed at protecting abortion rights, including revoking the Mexico City Policy and reactivating the Title X family planning program. However, these actions have been met with opposition from conservative lawmakers and have not had a significant impact on the status of abortion rights in the United States.\n\n### Medical abortion, in vitro fertilization, and other processes\n\nThe decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization has had significant implications for medical abortion, in vitro fertilization, and other reproductive processes. Some states have passed laws restricting access to these procedures, while others have passed laws protecting access to them.\n\n### Data privacy\n\nThe decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization has raised concerns about data privacy and the potential for abortion providers to be required to report patient data to the government. This has led to controversy and debate about the role of the government in regulating reproductive health care.\n\n### 2022 and 2024 United States election seasons\n\nThe decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization has had significant implications for the 2022 and 2024 United States election seasons. Many abortion rights advocates have become more engaged in politics and have mobilized to elect lawmakers who support reproductive rights.\n\n### Effects on abortion rates\n\nThe decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization has had significant implications for abortion rates in the United States. According to some estimates, the number of abortions performed in the United States has decreased since the decision.\n\n### Effects on infant mortality\n\nThe decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization has raised concerns about infant mortality and the potential for women to seek out unsafe abortions. This has led to controversy and debate about the role of the government in regulating reproductive health care.\n\nReaction\n\n### Legal journalists\n\nLegal journalists have reacted to the decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization with a mixture of surprise and criticism. Some have argued that the decision is a significant departure from precedent and that it will have far-reaching consequences for reproductive rights.\n\n### Political\n\n#### Support\n\nThe decision in Dobbs v.

However, other religious groups have expressed concern about the potential impact on vulnerable populations.\n\n### Civil rights\n\nThe decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization has raised concerns about civil rights and the potential for women of color to be disproportionately affected by restrictions on abortion access.\n\n### Health and education\n\nThe decision in Dobbs v.

The game was an exhibition match featuring a team of Australian soldiers from the Third Australian Divisional Squad, who were training in Australia during World War I, against a team of Australian Training Units Squad.\n\n**Origin**\n\nJohn Monash, the Commander of the Third Australian Division, was a strong advocate for the importance of sport in the military. Monash believed that sport helped to maintain the physical and mental well-being of soldiers, which was essential for their performance on the battlefield. He also recognized the value of sport as a way to bring together soldiers from different units and backgrounds, fostering camaraderie and esprit de corps.\n\nMonash's views on the value of sport were not unique to him. Many military leaders of the time recognized the benefits of sport in the military context. However, Monash's commitment to promoting sport among Australian soldiers was particularly notable, given the challenges and hardships faced by Australian troops during World War I.\n\n**Planning**\n\nThe planning for the 1916 Pioneer Exhibition Game began several weeks in advance. The Third Australian Divisional Squad, which was based at the MCG, was chosen to represent the Australian military in the match. The team was selected from among the best players in the squad, and they were trained specifically for the game.\n\nThe Australian Training Units Squad, which was based at nearby Victoria Barracks, was chosen to oppose the Third Australian Divisional Squad. The two teams were scheduled to meet on 28 October 1916, a date chosen to coincide with a scheduled training exercise.\n\n**Participants**\n\nThe Third Australian Divisional Squad team consisted of 22 players, who were all members of the Australian military. The team was captained by Sergeant-Major Charles Hill, who was a well-known footballer from Melbourne.\n\nThe Australian Training Units Squad team also consisted of 22 players, who were drawn from various units based at Victoria Barracks. The team was captained by Lieutenant George Willis, who was a member of the 11th Battalion.\n\n**Promotion**\n\nThe match was heavily promoted in the lead-up to the game. Posters and advertisements were displayed around Melbourne, featuring images of the two teams and details of the match. The Melbourne newspaper, The Argus, ran a series of articles and editorials highlighting the significance of the match and the importance of sport in the military.\n\n**The official programme**\n\nThe official programme for the 1916 Pioneer Exhibition Game was a comprehensive publication that included details of the teams, the match, and the various activities and events associated with the game.

The protests were primarily organized by truckers and their supporters who opposed the Canadian government's COVID-19 vaccination mandates and passports.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Canadian government had implemented various measures to control the spread of COVID-19, including vaccination mandates for certain groups, such as healthcare workers and federal employees. The government also required proof of vaccination for international travel, including crossing the US-Canada border. These measures were met with resistance from some Canadians who believed they were an overreach of government authority and an infringement on their personal freedoms.\n\n**Protest Goals**\n\nThe primary goals of the convoy protest were to:\n\n1. Oppose the Canadian government's COVID-19 vaccination mandates and passports\n2. Call for the removal of these measures\n3. Demand greater freedoms and autonomy for Canadians\n\n**Initial Events and the Start of the Protest**\n\nThe idea for the convoy protest began to take shape in mid-January 2022, when a group of truckers and their supporters organized a convoy to travel from British Columbia to Ottawa to protest the vaccination mandates and passports. The protest gained momentum through social media and fundraising campaigns.\n\n### American Influence\n\nThe convoy protest was heavily influenced by American conservative groups, including the Tea Party movement and libertarian organizations. These groups provided financial and organizational support to the Canadian protesters.\n\n### Fundraising\n\nThe convoy protest was largely funded through online fundraising campaigns, including GoFundMe and GiveSendGo. These campaigns raised millions of dollars in support of the protest.\n\n### Donor List Hacked\n\nIn February 2022, the donor list for the convoy protest was hacked, revealing the identities of many of the individuals who had donated to the cause. This led to a backlash against the donors, with some facing harassment and intimidation.\n\n**Vaccine Mandates and Passports**\n\nThe Canadian government's vaccination mandates and passports were a central issue in the convoy protest. The government required proof of vaccination for certain groups, such as healthcare workers and federal employees, and for international travel, including crossing the US-Canada border.\n\n### Vaccination Requirements for US-Canada Cross-Border Travel\n\nThe Canadian government required proof of vaccination for travelers crossing the US-Canada border.

He is known for his provocative and often humorous writings on politics, culture, and society.\n\n#Early Life\n\nMartin Amis was born in Oxford, England, to Sir Kingsley Amis, a novelist, poet, and critic, and Hilly Kuper, a secretary and socialite. He has a younger brother, Philip Amis, who is also a novelist. Amis was educated at Highgate School in London and later at Exeter College, Oxford, where he studied English literature.\n\n#Early Writing\n\nAmis's early writing was influenced by his father's work, but he quickly developed his own distinctive style. His first published novel, \"Clifford the Big Red Dog\" (1961), was written as a contribution to a children's magazine. However, it was his second novel, \"The Rachel Papers\" (1973), that brought him critical acclaim and established him as a rising talent in British literature.\n\n#Main Career\n\n##1980s and 1990s\n\nThe 1980s were a pivotal decade for Amis. He published several novels, including \"The Antipodeans\" (1986), which explored the world of expatriate life, and \"London Fields\" (1989), a dark and complex novel that delves into the world of literary pretensions and urban decay. The decade also saw the publication of \"Visitation\" (1991), a novel that explores the world of the wealthy and the emotions that accompany the passing of time.\n\n##2000s\n\nIn the 2000s, Amis continued to explore the complexities of human nature and society. His novel \"Experience\" (2000) is a memoir that chronicles his relationship with his mother, Hilary Kuper, and his struggles with addiction. \"Yellow Dog\" (2003) is a novel that revolves around the themes of family, love, and the search for meaning. \"House of Meetings\" (2006) is a novel that explores the world of Islamic fundamentalism and the complexities of human relationships.\n\n##2010s and 2020s\n\nIn the 2010s, Amis continued to write novels that explored the complexities of human nature and society. His novel \"The Pregnant Widow\" (2010) is a sweeping epic that explores the world of relationships and power dynamics. \"Lionel Asbo: State of England\" (2012) is a novel that explores the world of celebrity culture and the struggles of the working class. \"The Zone of Interest\" (2014) is a novel that explores the world of the Holocaust and the complexities of human relationships.\n\n##Other Work\n\n###University of Manchester\n\nIn 2001, Amis was appointed as the Professor of Contemporary Literature at the University of Manchester, a position he held until 2006. During his tenure, he taught creative writing and contributed to the university's literary events.\n\n#Personal Life\n\n##Death\n\nMartin Amis's father, Sir Kingsley Amis, died in 1995. His brother, Philip Amis, died in 2015. Amis is married to Isabel Fonseca, a writer and journalist.\n\n#Views\n\n##Writing\n\nAmis is known for his provocative and often humorous writings on politics, culture, and society. He has been a vocal critic of Islamism and has written extensively on the topic. His views on geopolitics and electoral politics have also been widely discussed.\n\n##Nuclear Proliferation\n\nAmis has been a vocal critic of nuclear proliferation and has written extensively on the topic. He has argued that nuclear deterrence is a flawed strategy and that the proliferation of nuclear weapons poses a significant threat to global security.\n\n##Geopolitics\n\nAmis has written extensively on geopolitics and has argued that the current international system is flawed. He has advocated for a more multipolar world order and has questioned the role of the United States in global affairs.\n\n##Electoral Politics\n\nAmis has written extensively on electoral politics and has argued that the current electoral system is flawed. He has advocated for electoral reform and has questioned the role of money in politics.\n\n##Islam and Islamism\n\nAmis has written extensively on Islam and Islamism and has argued that these ideologies pose a significant threat to Western values. He has advocated for a more nuanced understanding of Islam and has questioned the role of extremism in the religion.\n\n##Euthanasia\n\nAmis has written extensively on euthanasia and has argued that the current law on the topic is flawed. He has advocated for the legalization of euthanasia and has questioned the role of religion in shaping public policy.\n\n##Agnosticism\n\nAmis has identified as an agnostic and has written extensively on the topic.

The shortage was caused by a combination of factors, including supply chain issues, recall and plant shutdown, import restrictions, and market concentration.\n\nCauses\n\n### Supply chain issues\n\nThe supply chain issues that contributed to the infant formula shortage were complex and multifaceted. One key issue was the reliance on a limited number of manufacturers, which made the industry vulnerable to disruptions. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic had caused widespread supply chain disruptions, leading to shortages and delays in the delivery of raw materials, packaging, and other essential components.\n\n### Recall and plant shutdown\n\nIn February 2022, Abbott Nutrition, one of the largest infant formula manufacturers in the United States, announced a voluntary recall of its Similac, Alimentum, and EleCare formulas due to contamination concerns. The recall was prompted by reports of Cronobacter sakazakii, a bacteria that can cause severe illness in infants, being found in the company's Sturgis, Michigan plant. The recall was expanded to include additional products, and the plant was shut down for cleaning and sanitization.\n\n#### Alleged problems at Sturgis plant\n\nThe Sturgis plant had a history of problems, including equipment malfunctions, sanitation issues, and employee complaints about working conditions. In 2021, the plant was cited by the FDA for several violations, including inadequate sanitation and equipment maintenance. Some former employees and critics have alleged that the plant had systemic problems that contributed to the contamination and recall.\n\n### Import restrictions\n\nIn addition to the supply chain issues and recall, import restrictions also played a role in the infant formula shortage. The United States has strict regulations governing the importation of infant formula, which can make it difficult for companies to bring in alternative products. This has limited the availability of imported infant formula, exacerbating the shortage.\n\n### Market concentration\n\nThe infant formula market is highly concentrated, with a few large companies dominating the industry. This concentration can make it difficult for smaller companies to enter the market, leading to a lack of competition and innovation. Some critics have argued that the market concentration contributed to the shortage by limiting the availability of alternative products and creating a monopoly on the supply chain.\n\nEffects\n\n### Sale and donation of breast milk\n\nOne of the most immediate effects of the infant formula shortage was the surge in sales and donations of breast milk. Many hospitals and milk banks reported an increase in donations, and some companies even stepped in to provide breast milk to families in need. This shift towards breast milk was largely driven by the shortage and the desire to find alternative feeding options for infants.\n\n### Use of alternative foods\n\nThe shortage also led to the use of alternative foods, such as goat's milk and cow's milk, as a substitute for infant formula. However, the use of these alternatives can be problematic, as they may not provide the same nutritional benefits as infant formula. Some experts have warned that the use of alternative foods can lead to malnutrition and other health problems in infants.\n\n### Hospitalizations\n\nThe infant formula shortage led to an increase in hospitalizations, particularly for infants who were unable to access formula. Some hospitals reported an influx of patients, and others had to divert resources to care for infants who were in need of formula. The shortage also caused significant stress and anxiety for parents and caregivers, who were left to navigate the challenges of finding alternative feeding options.\n\n### Bot usage\n\nThe infant formula shortage also led to an increase in bot usage, particularly on social media. Many companies and organizations used bots to disseminate information and resources to families in need. However, some critics have raised concerns about the use of bots, arguing that they can be misleading and create more confusion.\n\n### Shortage in Canada\n\nThe infant formula shortage was not limited to the United States. Canada also experienced a shortage, particularly in the province of Ontario. The shortage was caused by a combination of factors, including supply chain issues and import restrictions. Some Canadian companies were forced to recall their products due to contamination concerns, further exacerbating the shortage.\n\nResponses\n\n### Efforts to prevent price gouging\n\nIn response to the infant formula shortage, many companies and organizations took steps to prevent price gouging. Some companies offered discounts or promotions to families in need, while others donated product to hospitals and other organizations. The FDA also took steps to prevent price gouging, including issuing guidance on pricing and distribution.\n\n### Efforts to increase supply\n\nThe FDA and other organizations also took steps to increase the supply of infant formula. The FDA relaxed some of its regulations governing the importation of infant formula, allowing for the entry of alternative products. Some companies also stepped in to provide additional production capacity, helping to meet the demand for infant formula.\n\n### Efforts to restore production\n\nThe FDA and other organizations also worked to restore production at the Abbott Nutrition plant in Sturgis, Michigan. The plant was shut down due to contamination concerns, but it was reopened after a thorough cleaning and sanitization. Some former employees and critics have raised concerns about the safety and efficacy of the plant, but the FDA has maintained that it is safe to operate.\n\n### Investigations\n\nThere were several investigations into the causes of the infant formula shortage. The FDA conducted an investigation into the Abbott Nutrition plant in Sturgis, Michigan, and found that the company had failed to meet some of its regulatory requirements. The investigation also found that the company had not taken adequate steps to prevent contamination. The FDA is also investigating other companies and organizations that may have contributed to the shortage.\n\n#### Congressional investigation\n\nThe U.S. Congress also conducted an investigation into the infant formula shortage. The investigation found that the shortage was caused by a combination of factors, including supply chain issues, recall and plant shutdown, import restrictions, and market concentration. The investigation also found that the FDA had not taken adequate steps to prevent the shortage, and that the agency had failed to communicate effectively with the public.\n\n#### FDA investigation\n\nThe FDA also conducted an investigation into the infant formula shortage. The investigation found that the agency had failed to meet some of its regulatory requirements, and that it had not taken adequate steps to prevent the shortage. The investigation also found that the agency had not communicated effectively with the public, and that it had not provided adequate guidance to companies and organizations.\n\n#### ABC News investigation\n\nABC News conducted an investigation into the infant formula shortage. The investigation found that the shortage was caused by a combination of factors, including supply chain issues, recall and plant shutdown, import restrictions, and market concentration. The investigation also found that some companies had raised prices significantly during the shortage, and that some companies had made false claims about the availability of their products.\n\n#### DOJ investigation\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice also conducted an investigation into the infant formula shortage. The investigation is ongoing, but it is believed to be focused on the companies and organizations that contributed to the shortage.\n\nCommentary\n\n### Breast milk vs. formula debate\n\nThe infant formula shortage has sparked a renewed debate about the use of breast milk versus formula. Some experts argue that breast milk is the best option for infants, while others argue that formula is a safe and effective alternative. The debate has been fueled by the shortage, with some companies and organizations advocating for the use of breast milk as a substitute for formula.\n\n### Criticism of federal response\n\nThe federal response to the infant formula shortage has been criticized by some experts and advocates. The FDA has been accused of not taking adequate steps to prevent the shortage, and of not communicating effectively with the public. The agency has also been criticized for its handling of the recall and plant shutdown, and for its failure to provide adequate guidance to companies and organizations.\n\n#### White House response\n\nThe White House has responded to the criticism of the federal response to the infant formula shortage. The administration has acknowledged that the shortage was caused by a combination of factors, including supply chain issues, recall and plant shutdown, import restrictions, and market concentration. The administration has also acknowledged that the FDA did not take adequate steps to prevent the shortage, and that the agency failed to communicate effectively with the public.\n\n#### Formula availability at the Southern border\n\nThe infant formula shortage has also raised concerns about the availability of formula at the Southern border. Some advocates have argued that the shortage has disproportionately affected families who rely on formula as their primary source of nutrition for their infants. The issue has sparked a debate about the need for greater access to formula for families in need, particularly in areas where access to healthcare and nutrition is limited.\n\nSee also\n\n* Infant formula\n* Abbott Nutrition\n* FDA\n* Supply chain\n* Recall\n* Plant shutdown\n* Import restrictions\n* Market concentration\n* Breast milk\n* Formula shortage\n* White House\n* FDA investigation\n* Congressional investigation\n* ABC News investigation\n* DOJ investigation", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The crisis was sparked by a military coup that overthrew the democratically elected government of President Mohamed Bazoum, and it has been marked by violent protests, demonstrations, and fighting between rival groups and the military.\n\n**Background**\n\n### ECOWAS\n\nThe Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), a regional economic organization, played a key role in the Nigerien crisis. ECOWAS had long been a key player in regional politics and security, and it had a strong interest in maintaining stability in Niger. When the coup occurred, ECOWAS quickly condemned the military's actions and called for the restoration of democracy.\n\n### Security situation\n\nNiger has a long history of security challenges, including terrorism, banditry, and inter-communal violence. The country has been a key partner in the US-led Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, and it has suffered significant losses in the fight against terrorism. The security situation in Niger has been further complicated by the presence of extremist groups, including the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS) and al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM).\n\n**Timeline**\n\n### July\n\n#### 29 July\n\nThe military coup that overthrew President Bazoum occurred on July 29, 2023.

Young's swimming career was marked by both incredible achievements and inconsistent performance, reflecting the challenges and limitations of competitive long-distance swimming in the early 20th century.\n\nEarly swimming achievements\n\nCatalina swim training\n\nGeorge Young's early training in swimming took place in the waters of Santa Catalina Island, off the coast of California. Under the guidance of experienced swimming coaches and mentors, Young honed his skills in open water swimming, which would become a hallmark of his career. The unique waters of Catalina Island, with its strong currents and varied marine life, provided Young with an ideal environment to develop the endurance and skill required for long-distance swimming.\n\nCatalina channel swim\n\nIn 1927, George Young embarked on a historic swim across the Catalina channel, a 21-mile stretch of water that separates the mainland from the island. This swim was a significant achievement, as it showcased Young's ability to navigate the treacherous waters of the channel and demonstrate his endurance in the face of challenging currents.\n\nYoung's swim across the Catalina channel was remarkable for several reasons. He swam with the tides, which added to the difficulty of the swim. The channel's strong currents and unpredictable marine life also posed significant challenges for Young, who had to rely on his skills and training to navigate the waters safely. Despite these obstacles, Young completed the swim in an impressive time, cementing his reputation as a talented long-distance swimmer.\n\nCompetition from Norman Ross\n\nDuring the 1920s, George Young faced stiff competition from Norman Ross, another accomplished long-distance swimmer. Ross was a formidable opponent, known for his speed and endurance in the water. The rivalry between Young and Ross pushed both swimmers to excel, as they competed for recognition and accolades in the world of competitive swimming.\n\nPublic acclaim, with limited financial gain\n\nGeorge Young's swims across the Catalina channel and in Lake Ontario generated significant public interest, with newspapers and media outlets covering his achievements. However, despite his remarkable performances, Young struggled to gain significant financial rewards for his efforts. In an era where professional sports were still in their infancy, long-distance swimming was not a lucrative career path, and Young often found himself struggling to make ends meet.\n\nInconsistent swimming career\n\n1927, 21-Mile Lake Ontario swim\n\nGeorge Young's swimming career was marked by periods of intense activity followed by periods of inactivity. In 1927, he completed a 21-mile swim in Lake Ontario, demonstrating his continued skill and endurance in the water. This swim was a notable achievement, as it pushed Young's limits and tested his ability to navigate the challenging waters of the lake.\n\n1928, 15-Mile Lake Ontario swim\n\nThe following year, Young completed a 15-mile swim in Lake Ontario, showcasing his ability to adapt to different swimming conditions and environments. This swim was a testament to Young's dedication and training, as he pushed himself to achieve remarkable feats in the water.\n\nWins Sept 1928 Montreal to Repentigney Marathon\n\nIn September 1928, George Young won the Montreal to Repentigney marathon, a grueling swim that pushed his endurance to the limit. This achievement solidified Young's reputation as a talented long-distance swimmer and cemented his place in the annals of competitive swimming history.\n\n1929, 15-mile Lake Ontario swim\n\nIn 1929, Young completed another 15-mile swim in Lake Ontario, demonstrating his continued skill and endurance in the water. This swim was notable for its challenging conditions, which included strong currents and unpredictable marine life.\n\n1930, 15-mile Lake Ontario swim\n\nThe following year, Young completed yet another 15-mile swim in Lake Ontario, showcasing his ability to adapt to different swimming conditions and environments. This swim was a testament to Young's dedication and training, as he pushed himself to achieve remarkable feats in the water.\n\nWins 1931 Lake Ontario win\n\nIn 1931, George Young won the Lake Ontario swim, a grueling competition that pushed his endurance to the limit. This achievement solidified Young's reputation as a talented long-distance swimmer and cemented his place in the annals of competitive swimming history.\n\nLate swim career\n\nAs the 1930s progressed, George Young's swimming career began to wind down. He continued to compete in various events, but his performances were no longer as consistent as they had been in the past. Despite this, Young remained a respected figure in the world of competitive swimming, known for his remarkable achievements and dedication to the sport.\n\nSwim retirement and marriage\n\nMarriages\n\nGeorge Young was married twice during his lifetime. His first marriage was to a woman named Elizabeth, with whom he had several children.

The bear, later nicknamed \"Cocaine Bear,\" was found dead in a cave in Tennessee, with a massive amount of cocaine in its system. The film takes creative liberties with the story, using the bear's death as a backdrop to explore themes of addiction, greed, and the consequences of playing with forces beyond human control.\n\nCast\n\nThe film features a talented ensemble cast, including:\n\n* Keri Russell as Allison, a park ranger and the protagonist of the film\n* Ray Liotta as Andrew, a wildlife enthusiast and Allison's love interest\n* O'Shea Jackson Jr. as Dewayne, a local resident who helps Allison in her investigation\n* Margo Martindale as Faye, a local shopkeeper with a troubled past\n* Alden Ehrenreich as Kevin, a young entrepreneur who becomes embroiled in the cocaine trade\n* Kristofer Hivju as Roger, a rugged outdoorsman and guide\n\nInspiration\n\nThe film was inspired by the true story of the Cocaine Bear, which was discovered in 1985 in a cave in Tennessee. The bear had ingested a large quantity of cocaine, which was left behind by a group of cocaine smugglers who had been using the cave as a hideout. The bear's death was a result of the cocaine overdose, and its body was later found in the cave by hunters.\n\nCreative liberties\n\nWhile the film is loosely based on the true story of the Cocaine Bear, it takes significant creative liberties with the narrative. The film's protagonist, Allison, is a park ranger who becomes embroiled in the cocaine trade, and her story is interwoven with that of the bear. The film also explores themes of addiction, greed, and the consequences of playing with forces beyond human control.\n\nResponse to the film\n\nThe film has received mixed reviews from critics, with some praising its unique blend of humor and drama, while others have criticized its tonal inconsistencies and lack of coherence. The film's cast has received praise for their performances, with Keri Russell and Ray Liotta being particularly praised for their chemistry on screen.\n\nProduction\n\nDevelopment and casting\n\nThe film was developed and produced by Universal Pictures and 87Eleven Productions. The film's script was written by Jimmy Warden, and the film was directed by Elizabeth Banks. The cast was assembled in 2020, with Keri Russell and Ray Liotta being the first to be cast in lead roles. The rest of the cast was assembled over the next few months, with Alden Ehrenreich and Kristofer Hivju being the final additions to the cast.\n\nFilming\n\nThe film was shot on location in Tennessee and Georgia, with a budget of $35 million. The film's production was marked by a series of setbacks, including a lengthy strike by the Screen Actors Guild and a series of delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite these challenges, the film's production was completed in 2022, and the film was released in 2023.\n\nMusic\n\nThe film's soundtrack was composed by Ludwig Göransson, and features a mix of original scores and popular songs. The soundtrack was released in 2023, and features a mix of genres, including electronic, rock, and hip-hop.\n\nRelease\n\nTheatrical\n\nThe film was released in theaters on March 4, 2023, and received a wide release in the United States. The film was released in over 3,000 theaters, and grossed over $20 million on its opening weekend.\n\nHome media\n\nThe film was released on DVD and Blu-ray on June 15, 2023, and features a special edition with bonus features and deleted scenes. The film's home media release was a commercial success, and grossed over $10 million in its first week of release.\n\nReception\n\nBox office\n\nThe film was a commercial success, grossing over $100 million worldwide. The film's opening weekend was particularly strong, with over $20 million being grossed in the United States. The film's worldwide gross was driven by its strong performance in China, where it grossed over $30 million.\n\nCritical response\n\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics, with some praising its unique blend of humor and drama, while others criticized its tonal inconsistencies and lack of coherence. The film's cast was praised for their performances, with Keri Russell and Ray Liotta being particularly praised for their chemistry on screen. The film's direction was criticized for being uneven, with some scenes being overly long and others being too short.\n\nAccolades\n\nThe film received several awards and nominations, including a nomination for Best Actress in a Comedy for Keri Russell at the 2023 Golden Globe Awards. The film also received a nomination for Best Original Score for Ludwig Göransson at the 2023 Critics' Choice Movie Awards.\n\nLegacy\n\nThe film has a dedicated fan base, with many fans praising its unique blend of humor and drama. The film's cast has also become popular, with Keri Russell and Ray Liotta being particularly praised for their performances. The film's legacy will likely be its ability to inspire new generations of filmmakers and actors, and its impact on the comedy-drama genre.\n\nSee also\n\n* Cocaine Bear (true story)\n* 87Eleven Productions\n* Universal Pictures\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n* Cocaine Bear at IMDb\n* Cocaine Bear at Rotten Tomatoes\n* Cocaine Bear at Metacritic", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

In April 2022, Elon Musk, a business magnate and entrepreneur, made a bid to acquire the platform, which would go on to become one of the most notable corporate acquisitions of the year.\n\n**Prelude**\n\n### Background\n\nTwitter, initially known as \"twttr,\" was founded by Jack Dorsey, Evan Williams, Biz Stone, and Noah Glass in March 2006. The platform quickly gained popularity as a microblogging site, allowing users to share short messages, or \"tweets,\" with their followers. Over the years, Twitter expanded its features and capabilities, incorporating multimedia content, live streaming, and advertising.\n\n### Early developments\n\nIn the early 2010s, Twitter's user growth slowed, and the company faced increased competition from other social media platforms, such as Facebook and Instagram. However, the platform continued to innovate, introducing features like Twitter Polls and Moments, which aimed to increase user engagement.\n\n**Buyout offer**\n\n### Takeover bid\n\nOn April 14, 2022, Elon Musk, through his investment firm, The Boring Company, made a bid to acquire Twitter for $44 billion. Musk, known for his outspoken views on free speech and censorship, stated that he wanted to ensure the platform remained a bastion of free expression. The offer was made at a premium of $54.20 per share, higher than Twitter's closing price on April 11.\n\n### Acquisition announcement\n\nOn April 25, 2022, Twitter's board of directors accepted Musk's offer, paving the way for the acquisition. The deal was expected to be completed by the end of 2022, pending regulatory approval.\n\n**Attempted termination**\n\n### Alleged hold\n\nIn July 2022, Musk alleged that Twitter had misled him about the number of spam accounts on the platform, which he claimed was a significant issue. This led to Musk attempting to terminate the acquisition agreement, citing a clause that allowed him to do so if he believed Twitter had provided false information.\n\n### Attempted withdrawal by Musk\n\nOn July 8, 2022, Musk announced that he was withdrawing from the acquisition, citing the issue with spam accounts and Twitter's failure to provide him with the necessary data. Twitter's board of directors responded by filing a lawsuit against Musk, seeking to enforce the acquisition agreement.\n\n**Revival and closing**\n\n### Revitalization of bid\n\nIn August 2022, Musk expressed his willingness to revisit the acquisition, stating that he was still committed to the deal. Twitter's board of directors, eager to see the acquisition completed, agreed to revive the agreement.\n\n### Completion of purchase\n\nOn October 27, 2022, the acquisition was finally completed, with Musk taking control of Twitter for $44 billion. The deal marked one of the largest corporate acquisitions of the year.\n\n### Post-acquisition\n\nFollowing the acquisition, Musk announced significant changes to Twitter's policies and features, including the introduction of a new moderation policy and the launch of a Twitter Blue subscription service. The platform has continued to evolve under Musk's ownership, with ongoing efforts to improve user experience and increase revenue.\n\n**Reactions**\n\n### Takeover bid\n\nThe initial takeover bid by Musk was met with a mixed reaction from Twitter's users and shareholders. Some welcomed the prospect of Musk's leadership, citing his commitment to free speech and innovation. Others expressed concerns about his ownership style and the potential impact on the platform's culture.\n\n### Acquisition announcement\n\nWhen the acquisition was announced, Twitter's stock price surged, and many analysts praised the deal as a positive development for the company. However, others raised concerns about the potential risks and challenges associated with Musk's ownership.\n\n### Attempted termination\n\nMusk's attempt to terminate the acquisition agreement was met with widespread criticism, with many accusing him of trying to renegotiate the deal after realizing its complexity. Twitter's board of directors was also criticized for its handling of the situation.\n\n### Completion of purchase\n\nThe completion of the acquisition was widely reported, with many analysts and observers weighing in on the implications of Musk's ownership. Some praised his commitment to innovation and user experience, while others expressed concerns about his leadership style and the potential impact on the platform's culture.\n\n**Critical analysis**\n\n### Takeover bid and acquisition announcement\n\nThe takeover bid and acquisition announcement have been subject to significant analysis and debate. Some have praised Musk's commitment to free speech and innovation, while others have raised concerns about his ownership style and the potential impact on the platform's culture.\n\n### Attempted termination\n\nMusk's attempt to terminate the acquisition agreement has been widely criticized, with many accusing him of trying to renegotiate the deal after realizing its complexity.

His father, Dondinho, was a professional footballer who played for Santos FC, but his career was cut short due to an injury.

The film is the sequel to Cameron's 2009 film Avatar and the second installment in the Avatar franchise. The film stars Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Sigourney Weaver, Stephen Lang, and Cliff Curtis, among others.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film takes place 13 years after the events of the first film. Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), a human who became a Na'vi, is now the leader of the Omaticaya clan, married to Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) and the father of two children, Neteyam and Lo'ak. However, their peaceful life is disrupted by the return of Colonel Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang), who is resurrected in a genetically engineered Na'vi body. Quaritch seeks revenge against Jake and the Na'vi, while also searching for a new source of Unobtanium, a valuable mineral found only on Pandora.\n\nMeanwhile, Jake's children are struggling to find their place in the Na'vi culture. Neteyam, the eldest, is torn between his human and Na'vi heritage, while Lo'ak, the younger, is struggling to communicate with his mother and father. As tensions rise, Jake and Neytiri must navigate the complexities of their family dynamics and the threat of Quaritch, all while trying to protect their people and the planet they call home.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Sam Worthington as Jake Sully\n* Zoe Saldana as Neytiri\n* Sigourney Weaver as Dr. Norm Spellman\n* Stephen Lang as Colonel Miles Quaritch\n* Cliff Curtis as Tonowari\n* Edie Falco as General Ardmore\n* Brendan Cowell as Captain Mick Scoresby\n* Joel David Moore as Dr. Norm Spellman\n* Michelle Yeoh as Dr. Karina Mogue\n* CCH Pounder as Mo'at\n* Jamie Flatters as Neteyam Sully\n* Britain Dalton as Lo'ak Sully\n* Trinity Bliss as Tuktirey Sully\n* Duane Evans Jr. as Aonung Sully\n* Filip Geljo as Dr. Max Patel\n\n**Themes and Analysis**\n\nAvatar: The Way of Water explores several themes, including the clash between technology and nature, the importance of family and community, and the struggle for identity and belonging. The film also examines the consequences of colonialism and the exploitation of resources, as well as the importance of preserving cultural heritage and traditions.\n\nOne of the most significant themes in the film is the concept of \"home\" and what it means to belong to a place and a people. Jake and Neytiri's relationship serves as a central focus for this theme, as they navigate their love for each other and their respective cultures. The film also explores the complexities of family dynamics, particularly in the context of the Na'vi's matrilineal society.\n\n**Production**\n\n#### Development\n\nJames Cameron began working on the script for Avatar: The Way of Water in 2010, shortly after the release of the first film. The story was initially conceived as a sequel to the original, but Cameron eventually decided to expand the narrative to include more of the Na'vi characters and their culture. The script underwent several revisions before Cameron was satisfied with the final version.\n\n#### Writing\n\nThe screenplay for Avatar: The Way of Water was written by James Cameron. Cameron is a self-taught writer and director, and he has a reputation for being a meticulous and detail-oriented filmmaker. The script for the film was reportedly the longest of Cameron's career, clocking in at over 600 pages.\n\n#### Casting\n\nThe cast for Avatar: The Way of Water was announced in 2017, with Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana reprising their roles as Jake Sully and Neytiri.

The production used a combination of live-action and performance capture techniques to bring the Na'vi characters to life. The film also features extensive use of visual effects, including the creation of the Na'vi's elaborate costumes and the environments of Pandora.\n\n#### Performance Capture\n\nThe performance capture process for Avatar: The Way of Water involved a team of actors and technicians working together to capture the performances of the Na'vi characters. The actors wore specialized suits equipped with sensors and cameras, which captured their movements and expressions in real-time. The data was then used to create the digital characters and environments for the film.\n\n#### Live-Action\n\nThe live-action portion of the film was shot on location in Queensland, Australia. The production used a combination of 3D cameras and traditional film equipment to capture the performances of the actors.\n\n#### Visual Effects\n\nThe visual effects for Avatar: The Way of Water were created by a team of artists and technicians at Weta Digital, a special effects company based in New Zealand. The team used a variety of techniques, including motion capture and 3D modeling, to bring the Na'vi characters and environments to life.\n\n#### Runtime\n\nThe runtime of Avatar: The Way of Water is 3 hours and 12 minutes, making it one of the longest films of the year.\n\n**Music**\n\nThe music for Avatar: The Way of Water was composed by Simon Franglen, who worked closely with James Cameron to create the score. The soundtrack features a mix of electronic and orchestral elements, and incorporates traditional Na'vi music and instruments.\n\n**Marketing**\n\nThe marketing campaign for Avatar: The Way of Water was extensive, with a focus on social media and online advertising. The film's trailer was released in 2021, and featured a mix of action-packed sequences and emotional moments from the film.

The home media release features a number of bonus features, including deleted scenes, behind-the-scenes footage, and a making-of documentary.\n\n**Reception**\n\n#### Box Office\n\nAvatar: The Way of Water was a commercial success, grossing over $2.3 billion at the box office worldwide.

The first Mutiny Act was passed in 1689, and subsequent acts were passed in 1694, 1703, 1711, 1714, 1723, 1727, 1714, 1757, 1775, and 1814. The laws were designed to maintain discipline and order within the armed forces, and to ensure that the military remained loyal to the government.\n\nPassage of the first Mutiny Act\n\nThe first Mutiny Act was passed on April 16, 1689, shortly after the Glorious Revolution. The act was a response to the perceived threat of a military coup, and was designed to prevent the armed forces from becoming a source of power and influence. The act established the concept of martial law, and made it a crime for a member of the armed forces to \"excite\" any mutiny or rebellion.\n\nThe act also established the office of the Judge Advocate General, who was responsible for investigating and prosecuting cases of mutiny. The act was a significant step in the development of the British military justice system, and laid the foundation for the laws and regulations that would govern the behavior of the armed forces for centuries to come.\n\nRenewal of the Mutiny Acts\n\nThe Mutiny Acts were renewed and revised on several occasions in the 18th and 19th centuries. The 1694 act made it a crime for a member of the armed forces to \"abandon\" their duty or to \"desert\" the service. The 1703 act established the concept of \"court-martial,\" and made it a crime for a member of the armed forces to disobey a lawful order.\n\nThe 1711 act made it a crime for a member of the armed forces to \"excite\" any mutiny or rebellion, and established the office of the Judge Advocate General as a permanent fixture of the military justice system. The 1714 act made it a crime for a member of the armed forces to \" desert\" the service, and established the concept of \"desertion\" as a serious offense.\n\nThe 1723 act established the concept of \"mutiny\" as a specific offense, and made it a crime for a member of the armed forces to engage in any behavior that could be considered a mutiny. The 1727 act made it a crime for a member of the armed forces to \"abandon\" their duty or to \"desert\" the service.\n\nThe Quartering Acts\n\nThe Quartering Acts were a series of laws passed in England and its subsequent successor states to regulate the behavior of the armed forces, particularly the Royal Navy, and to provide for the quartering of troops in civilian areas. The first Quartering Act was passed in 1662, and subsequent acts were passed in 1679, 1689, 1699, 1706, 1714, 1715, and 1730.\n\nThe Quartering Acts were designed to provide for the quartering of troops in civilian areas, and to regulate the behavior of the armed forces in these areas. The acts established the concept of \"quartering\" as a specific offense, and made it a crime for a member of the armed forces to \"refuse\" to quarter.\n\nThe Quartering Acts also established the concept of \"military necessity,\" and made it a crime for a member of the armed forces to \" refuse\" to quarter in cases where it was deemed necessary for the safety and security of the civilian population. The Quartering Acts were a significant step in the development of the British military justice system, and laid the foundation for the laws and regulations that would govern the behavior of the armed forces for centuries to come.\n\nList\n\nThe following is a list of the Mutiny Acts passed in England and its subsequent successor states:\n\nEngland\n\n* 1689: An Act for the more effectual Suppression of Mutinies and Seditions in His Majesty's Navies and Ships of War.\n* 1694: An Act for the more effectual Suppression of Mutinies and Seditions in His Majesty's Navies and Ships of War.\n* 1703: An Act for the more effectual Suppression of Mutinies and Seditions in His Majesty's Navies and Ships of War.\n* 1711: An Act for the more effectual Suppression of Mutinies and Seditions in His Majesty's Navies and Ships of War.\n* 1714: An Act for the more effectual Suppression of Mutinies and Seditions in His Majesty's Navies and Ships of War.\n* 1723: An Act for the more effectual Suppression of Mutinies and Seditions in His Majesty's Navies and Ships of War.\n* 1727: An Act for the more effectual Suppression of Mutinies and Seditions in His Majesty's Navies and Ships of War.\n\nGreat Britain\n\n* 1757: An Act for the more effectual Suppression of Mutinies and Seditions in His Majesty's Navies and Ships of War.\n* 1775: An Act for the more effectual Suppression of Mutinies and Seditions in His Majesty's Navies and Ships of War.\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\n* 1814: An Act for the more effectual Suppression of Mutinies and Seditions in His Majesty's Navies and Ships of War.\n\n### 1800s\n\n* 1803: An Act for the more effectual Suppression of Mutinies and Seditions in His Majesty's Navies and Ships of War.\n* 1809: An Act for the more effectual Suppression of Mutinies and Seditions in His Majesty's Navies and Ships of War.\n\n### 1810s\n\n* 1811: An Act for the more effectual Suppression of Mutinies and Seditions in His Majesty's Navies and Ships of War.\n* 1812: An Act for the more effectual Suppression of Mutinies and Seditions in His Majesty's Navies and Ships of War.\n* 1813: An Act for the more effectual Suppression of Mutinies and Seditions in His Majesty's Navies and Ships of War.\n\n### 1820s\n\n* 1822: An Act for the more effectual Suppression of Mutinies and Seditions in His Majesty's Navies and Ships of War.\n* 1825: An Act for the more effectual Suppression of Mutinies and Seditions in His Majesty's Navies and Ships of War.\n\n### 1830s\n\n* 1831: An Act for the more effectual Suppression of Mutinies and Seditions in His Majesty's Navies and Ships of War.\n* 1832: An Act for the more effectual Suppression of Mutinies and Seditions in His Majesty's Navies and Ships of War.\n* 1833: An Act for the more effectual Suppression of Mutinies and Seditions in His Majesty's Navies and Ships of War.\n\n### 1840s\n\n* 1841: An Act for the more effectual Suppression of Mutinies and Seditions in His Majesty's Navies and Ships of War.\n* 1845: An Act for the more effectual Suppression of Mutinies and Seditions in His Majesty's Navies and Ships of War.\n\n### 1850s\n\n* 1852: An Act for the more effectual Suppression of Mutinies and Seditions in His Majesty's Navies and Ships of War.\n* 1855: An Act for the more effectual Suppression of Mutinies and Seditions in His Majesty's Navies and Ships of War.\n\n### 1860s\n\n* 1862: An Act for the more effectual Suppression of Mutinies and Seditions in His Majesty's Navies and Ships of War.\n* 1865: An Act for the more effectual Suppression of Mutinies and Seditions in His Majesty's Navies and Ships of War.\n\n### 1870s\n\n* 1871: An Act for the more effectual Suppression of Mutinies and Seditions in His Majesty's Navies and Ships of War.\n* 1874: An Act for the more effectual Suppression of Mutinies and Seditions in His Majesty's Navies and Ships of War.\n\nMarine Mutiny Acts\n\nThe Marine Mutiny Acts were a series of laws passed in the United States to regulate the behavior of the marine corps and to prevent mutinies.

It is the sequel to the 1986 film Top Gun, which was directed by Tony Scott and starred Tom Cruise as the iconic character Maverick.\n\nThe film follows Maverick, who is now a test pilot and instructor, as he is tasked with training a new generation of fighter pilots for a top-secret mission. Along the way, he must confront his past and face his fears, all while navigating the complexities of modern warfare.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film takes place 34 years after the events of the original Top Gun. Maverick (Tom Cruise) is now a test pilot and instructor at the Top Gun Naval Aviator School, where he trains the next generation of fighter pilots. The film opens with Maverick and his team participating in a high-stakes mission to destroy a uranium enrichment facility in an unnamed country.\n\nHowever, the mission goes awry, and Maverick is forced to eject from his aircraft, the F/A-18 Hornet. He is pulled to safety by his radar intercept officer (RIO), Goose's son, Bradley \"Rooster\" Bradshaw (Miles Teller), who is also a student at the Top Gun school.\n\nMaverick is later approached by Admiral Jon Cummings (Jon Hamm), who informs him that he has been selected to lead a team of pilots on a mission to destroy a uranium enrichment facility in an unnamed country. The mission is deemed too difficult for the current crop of pilots, and Maverick is chosen due to his exceptional skills and experience.\n\nMaverick is tasked with selecting a team of pilots to accompany him on the mission, which involves flying the F/A-18 Hornet through a narrow canyon to reach the target. He selects Rooster, along with Lieutenant Natasha \"Phoenix\" Trace (Monica Barbaro), Lieutenant Brigham \"Bud\" \"Hollywood\" \"Hills\" (Lewis Pullman), and Lieutenant Robert \"Bob\" Floyd (Danny Ramirez).\n\nAs the team begins to train for the mission, Maverick must confront his past and face his fears, all while navigating the complexities of modern warfare. He also develops a close relationship with Penny Benjamin (Jennifer Connelly), the widow of his former Radar Intercept Officer (RIO), Nick \"Goose\" Bradshaw.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Tom Cruise as Captain Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell\n* Miles Teller as Lieutenant Bradley \"Rooster\" Bradshaw\n* Jennifer Connelly as Penny Benjamin\n* Jon Hamm as Admiral Jon Cummings\n* Glen Powell as Lieutenant Jake \"Hangman\" Seresin\n* Lewis Pullman as Lieutenant Brigham \"Bud\" \"Hollywood\" \"Hills\"\n* Monica Barbaro as Lieutenant Natasha \"Phoenix\" Trace\n* Danny Ramirez as Lieutenant Robert \"Bob\" Floyd\n* Lewis Gunter as Lieutenant Mike \"Viper\" Metcalf\n* Charles Parnell as Admiral Cyclone C.

However, the project was put on hold due to Scott's death in 2012. In 2015, Jerry Bruckheimer and David Ellison announced that the film was being redeveloped, with Joseph Kosinski set to direct.\n\n#### Writing\n\nThe screenplay for Top Gun: Maverick was written by Ehren Kruger, Eric Warren Singer, Christopher McQuarrie, Peter Craig, and Justin Marks. The script underwent significant changes during development, with the original draft featuring a more traditional sequel structure.\n\n#### Casting\n\nThe casting process for Top Gun: Maverick began in 2018, with Tom Cruise and Miles Teller confirmed to reprise their roles as Maverick and Rooster. The rest of the cast was announced over the next year, with Glen Powell, Lewis Pullman, and Monica Barbaro joining the film.\n\n#### Filming\n\nPrincipal photography for Top Gun: Maverick began in May 2018 and concluded in October 2018. The film was shot on location in California, Arizona, and the United Kingdom.\n\n#### Aircraft\n\n##### Darkstar\n\nThe Darkstar is a fictional aircraft that is featured in the film. It is a high-speed, stealthy aircraft that is designed to penetrate enemy airspace undetected. The Darkstar is a key component of the mission that Maverick and his team are tasked with.\n\n##### F-14\n\nThe F-14 Tomcat is a real-world aircraft that is featured in the film. It is a twin-engine, variable-sweep wing fighter jet that was operated by the United States Navy from 1974 to 2006.

It was the second kingdom to unify the various city-states of Siam, after the Sukhothai Kingdom. At its peak, the Ayutthaya Kingdom was a major power in Southeast Asia, known for its rich culture, advanced economy, and strong military.\n\n**History**\n\n### Origins\n\nThe origins of the Ayutthaya Kingdom date back to the 13th century, when the city-states of Siam were still fragmented and independent. The early history of Ayutthaya is shrouded in legend, but it is believed that the kingdom was founded by King Ramathibodi I (1350-1369), who united the various city-states and established the capital at Ayutthaya.\n\n#### Pre-Ayutthaya cities\n\nBefore the founding of Ayutthaya, the region was inhabited by various city-states, including Sukhothai, Lopburi, and Phitsanulok. These cities were known for their advanced agriculture, trade, and culture, and were influenced by Indian, Chinese, and Khmer traditions.\n\n#### The traditional founding of Ayutthaya\n\nThe traditional account of the founding of Ayutthaya is that King Ramathibodi I was a wise and just ruler who united the city-states and established a strong and prosperous kingdom. He is said to have been inspired by Buddhist ideals and to have built many temples and monuments, including the famous Wat Phra Si Sanphet.\n\n### Early maritime dominance\n\nDuring the 14th to 15th centuries, the Ayutthaya Kingdom expanded its influence through maritime trade and conquest. The kingdom established trade relationships with China, India, and other Southeast Asian kingdoms, and its merchants played a major role in the regional trade network.\n\n### Age of warfare\n\nIn the 16th to 18th centuries, the Ayutthaya Kingdom was involved in a series of wars with neighboring kingdoms, including the Burmese, the Lan Xang, and the Khmer. These wars were often sparked by territorial disputes, trade rivalries, and ideological differences.\n\n#### Transition to a hinterland state\n\nAs the Ayutthaya Kingdom expanded its influence, it became increasingly focused on its internal affairs and less concerned with maritime trade. The kingdom's economy became more dependent on agriculture and trade with neighboring countries, rather than on international trade.\n\n#### Centralization and dominance of the Northern lords\n\nDuring the 16th to 17th centuries, the Ayutthaya Kingdom experienced a period of centralization, with the Northern lords playing a dominant role in the kingdom's politics.

The kingdom's economy was also affected by the introduction of capitalism and the rise of commoners.\n\n#### Continued prosperity and increased Chinese connections\n\nDespite the challenges, the Ayutthaya Kingdom continued to experience economic and cultural growth, with increased connections with China and other Southeast Asian kingdoms.\n\n#### Succession conflicts and corruption\n\nThe kingdom was plagued by succession conflicts and corruption, which weakened the kingdom's institutions and led to a decline in its power and influence.\n\n#### Introduction of capitalism, rise of commoners, and proto-nationalism\n\nThe late Ayutthaya period saw the introduction of capitalism, the rise of commoners, and the emergence of proto-nationalist sentiments, which would eventually lead to the modern Thai nation-state.\n\n#### Nobility and Buddhism\n\nThe Ayutthaya Kingdom was a Buddhist society, with a strong emphasis on the role of the nobility in maintaining the kingdom's institutions and traditions.

The fall of Ayutthaya marked the end of the kingdom and the beginning of a new era in Thai history.\n\n#### Aftermath\n\nThe fall of Ayutthaya had a significant impact on the region, with the Burmese Kingdom expanding its influence and the Thai Kingdom emerging as a new power.

The war has its roots in Ukraine's struggle for independence and sovereignty, as well as Russia's expansionist ambitions in the region.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Independent Ukraine and the Orange Revolution\n\nUkraine gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, following the collapse of the Soviet Empire. The country's early years were marked by economic and political instability, but in 2004, Ukraine experienced a significant turning point with the Orange Revolution. The revolution, led by opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko, brought about a peaceful transfer of power, marking a significant step towards democracy in Ukraine.\n\n### Euromaidan, Revolution of Dignity, and pro-Russian unrest\n\nHowever, Ukraine's progress towards democracy was short-lived. In 2013, President Viktor Yanukovych, who had come to power in 2010, announced that Ukraine would not sign an association agreement with the European Union, opting instead for a closer relationship with Russia. This decision sparked widespread protests in Kiev, known as the Euromaidan movement. The protests, which began in November 2013, eventually led to the ousting of President Yanukovych in February 2014.\n\nThe aftermath of the Revolution of Dignity saw a surge in pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine's eastern regions, particularly in the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. These regions, which had historically been heavily industrialized and reliant on the Russian economy, began to experience a decline in living standards and economic opportunities.\n\n### Russian military bases in Crimea\n\nRussia had maintained a significant military presence in Crimea, a peninsula that is integral to Ukraine but has a majority Russian-speaking population. In 2014, Russia used this presence to annex Crimea, citing the need to protect the local population and preserve Russia's strategic interests.\n\n### Legality and declaration of war\n\nThe annexation of Crimea was widely condemned by the international community, with many nations viewing it as a clear violation of Ukraine's sovereignty. The United Nations General Assembly passed a non-binding resolution condemning the annexation, while the European Union and the United States imposed economic sanctions on Russia.\n\n**History**\n\n### Russian annexation of Crimea (2014)\n\nOn February 27, 2014, Russian troops began to occupy key buildings and infrastructure in Crimea, including the Sevastopol naval base and the Simferopol airport. The annexation was formalized on March 18, 2014, when a referendum was held in which the majority of Crimean residents voted to join Russia.\n\n### War in the Donbas (2014–2015)\n\nFollowing the annexation of Crimea, pro-Russian separatists in the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts declared independence from Ukraine, leading to a full-scale armed conflict between Ukrainian government forces and Russian-backed separatists.\n\n#### Pro-Russia unrest\n\nThe conflict in the Donbas region began in April 2014, with pro-Russian protests and violent clashes between Ukrainian government forces and separatists. The violence escalated in June 2014, with the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, which had been shot down by a Russian-made Buk missile system.\n\n#### Armed conflict\n\nThe conflict in the Donbas region officially began on April 6, 2014, when pro-Russian separatists seized government buildings in Donetsk and Luhansk. The Ukrainian government responded with force, but was ultimately unable to dislodge the separatists.\n\n#### August 2014 Russian invasion\n\nIn August 2014, Russian military forces crossed the border into Ukraine, sparking a significant escalation of the conflict. The Ukrainian military was unable to resist the Russian advance, and the city of Donetsk fell to the separatists.\n\n#### Mariupol offensive and first Minsk ceasefire\n\nIn January 2015, the Ukrainian military launched a successful counterattack against the separatists in the Mariupol region, pushing them back and securing a significant victory. The conflict officially ended on February 15, 2015, with the signing of the Minsk I agreement, which established a ceasefire and laid out a roadmap for a peaceful resolution to the conflict.\n\n#### End of 2014 and Minsk II agreement\n\nThe end of 2014 saw a significant escalation of the conflict, with both sides suffering heavy losses. However, in February 2015, a new ceasefire was agreed upon, known as the Minsk II agreement. The agreement established a framework for a negotiated settlement to the conflict and set out a roadmap for a peaceful resolution.\n\n### Line of conflict stabilizes (2015–2022)\n\nThe conflict in the Donbas region stabilized in 2015, with both sides adhering to the terms of the Minsk II agreement. The conflict was largely frozen in place, with occasional skirmishes and clashes, but no major military offensives.\n\n#### 2018 Kerch Strait incident\n\nIn November 2018, a Russian coast guard vessel fired on three Ukrainian naval vessels that were attempting to pass through the Kerch Strait, which connects the Black Sea to the Sea of Azov. The incident sparked a significant escalation of tensions between Russia and Ukraine, but ultimately did not lead to a major military conflict.\n\n#### 2019–2020\n\nThroughout 2019 and 2020, the conflict in the Donbas region remained relatively stable, with both sides adhering to the terms of the Minsk II agreement. However, tensions between Russia and Ukraine remained high, with occasional skirmishes and clashes.\n\n### Full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine (2022)\n\n#### Prelude\n\nThe conflict in Ukraine escalated significantly in 2022, with a full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine. The invasion, which began on February 24, 2022, was sparked by a series of buildups and provocations by Russian forces along the Ukrainian border.\n\n#### Escalation\n\nThe invasion was marked by a series of rapid advances by Russian forces, who quickly captured key cities and infrastructure in Ukraine's eastern regions. However, the Ukrainian military was able to resist the Russian advance, and the conflict became a protracted and bloody stalemate.\n\n#### Full-scale invasion\n\nThe full-scale invasion of Ukraine marked a significant escalation of the conflict, with both sides suffering heavy losses. The conflict has continued to this day, with no end in sight.\n\n### Ukrainian counteroffensives and stalemate (2022–2023)\n\nThroughout 2022 and 2023, the Ukrainian military launched a series of successful counteroffensives against the Russians, pushing them back and securing significant gains. However, the conflict remains a stalemate, with both sides dug in and unwilling to yield.\n\n### Russian campaigns and Ukrainian Kursk offensive (1 December 2023 – present)\n\nIn recent weeks, Russian forces have launched a series of campaigns against the Ukrainian military, including a major push in the Kursk region.

The characters in the film are all drawn to the glamour and excitement of Hollywood, but as they become more successful, they begin to lose themselves in the process. Manny, for example, becomes increasingly obsessed with his own success and begins to neglect his relationships and his own well-being.\n\nThe film also explores the rise of organized crime in the 1920s. The characters in the film are all aware of the presence of organized crime in Hollywood, but they are also drawn to the excitement and glamour of the industry. The film suggests that the excesses of the Roaring Twenties are a result of the corrupting influence of power and the desire for wealth and fame.\n\nRelease\n--------\n\n### Theatrical\n\nBabylon was released in theaters on December 23, 2022.

{"title": "Fuzzball_(string_theory)", "content": "#Physical properties\n##String theory and composition\n##Densities\n##Neutron star collapse\n#Information paradox\n#Testability of the theory\n#References\n#External links\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Fuzzball (string theory)\n\nIn the realm of string theory, a fuzzball is a hypothetical object that represents a black hole in a scenario where the fundamental building blocks of the universe are not point-like particles, but tiny, vibrating strings. This concept was first introduced by Gerard 't Hooft in the 1990s and later developed by string theorists such as Juan Maldacena and Leonard Susskind.\n\n**Physical properties**\n\n### String theory and composition\n\nAccording to string theory, the universe is composed of tiny, vibrating strings that give rise to the various particles we observe. In the context of black holes, these strings are thought to be the fundamental constituents of the black hole's structure. Fuzzballs are a way of describing the behavior of these strings in the vicinity of a black hole. They are characterized by the idea that the information about the matter that fell into the black hole is encoded on the surface of the fuzzball, rather than being lost in the black hole's interior.\n\nIn a sense, fuzzballs can be thought of as a \"smearing out\" of the information contained in the matter that fell into the black hole. This information is encoded on the surface of the fuzzball in a way that is similar to how the information contained in a hologram is encoded on a two-dimensional surface. This idea is often referred to as the \"holographic principle.\"\n\n### Densities\n\nThe density of a fuzzball is a complex and multifaceted concept that is still the subject of active research in the field of string theory. In general, the density of a fuzzball is thought to be a function of the energy density of the matter that fell into the black hole. In other words, the density of the fuzzball is determined by the amount of energy that was contained in the matter that fell into the black hole.\n\nOne of the key features of fuzzballs is that they are thought to have a very high density, often exceeding the density of a normal black hole by many orders of magnitude. This is because the energy contained in the matter that fell into the black hole is concentrated on the surface of the fuzzball, rather than being spread out over the volume of the black hole.\n\n### Neutron star collapse\n\nOne of the ways in which fuzzballs are thought to form is through the collapse of a neutron star. When a neutron star collapses, it can create a black hole. However, in the context of string theory, the collapse of a neutron star can also create a fuzzball.\n\nIn this scenario, the neutron star is thought to be composed of a large number of strings, which are the fundamental constituents of the universe. When the neutron star collapses, these strings are compressed and energy is released. The energy released is thought to be encoded on the surface of the fuzzball, rather than being lost in the black hole's interior.\n\n**Information paradox**\n\nOne of the most famous problems in physics is the information paradox, which was first identified by Stephen Hawking in the 1970s. The paradox arises from the fact that black holes appear to destroy information, in the sense that the information contained in matter that falls into the black hole is lost forever.\n\nHowever, the holographic principle and the concept of fuzzballs suggest that information is not lost in a black hole, but is instead encoded on the surface of the fuzzball. This raises a number of questions about the nature of reality and the fundamental laws of physics.\n\nOne of the key implications of the information paradox is that it challenges our understanding of the concept of space and time. If information is not lost in a black hole, but is instead encoded on the surface of the fuzzball, then what does this mean for our understanding of the nature of space and time?\n\n**Testability of the theory**\n\nOne of the key challenges facing string theory is that it is a highly speculative and mathematical theory, which makes it difficult to test and verify. However, the concept of fuzzballs and the holographic principle offer a number of potential ways in which string theory can be tested and verified.\n\nFor example, the idea that information is encoded on the surface of a fuzzball suggests that it should be possible to measure the information contained in a black hole by studying the properties of the fuzzball. This could potentially be done using a variety of experimental techniques, such as gravitational wave astronomy or high-energy particle physics.\n\nIn addition, the concept of fuzzballs and the holographic principle offer a number of potential ways in which string theory can be tested and verified in the laboratory. For example, it may be possible to create a fuzzball in a laboratory setting using a high-energy particle accelerator or other experimental technique.\n\n**References**\n\nThis article has been written without references, as the information contained within is not widely cited or referenced in the scientific literature.\n\n**External links**\n\n* String theory\n* Black hole\n* Holographic principle\n* Fuzzball theory\n* Juan Maldacena\n* Leonard Susskind\n* Gerard 't Hooft", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.
