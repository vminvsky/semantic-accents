The term \"tartan\" is often associated with the country's rich cultural heritage and history, and is a key aspect of Scottish identity.\n\n**Etymology and Terminology**\n-----------------------------\n\nThe word \"tartan\" is derived from the French term \"tartane,\" which refers to a type of woolen fabric. Over time, the spelling and pronunciation of the word evolved, and it became the standard term for describing the distinctive patterns found in Scottish textiles.\n\n**Weaving and Design**\n---------------------\n\n### Weaving Construction\n\nTartan patterns are created using a specific type of weaving known as \"sett weaving.\" This process involves the use of a set of warp threads, typically made from wool or other natural fibers, which are woven together to create a repeating pattern. The sett is the specific arrangement of warp threads, and is responsible for the overall appearance of the tartan.\n\n### Styles and Design Principles\n\nTartan patterns can be divided into several distinct styles, each with its own unique characteristics and design principles. These styles include:\n\n* **Broken sett:** A broken sett tartan features a repeating pattern of warp threads, with each thread separated by a space.\n* **Unbroken sett:** An unbroken sett tartan features a repeating pattern of warp threads, with no spaces between them.\n* **Herringbone:** A herringbone tartan features a repeating pattern of alternating colors, creating a herringbone-like effect.\n* **Diamond:** A diamond tartan features a repeating pattern of diamonds, typically with a bold and striking design.\n\n### Colour, Palettes, and Meaning\n\nTartan patterns are typically created using a specific color palette, which is chosen to reflect the wearer's status, affiliation, or cultural heritage. The colors used in tartan patterns are often symbolic, with specific meanings associated with each hue. For example:\n\n* **Red:** Represents courage and strength\n* **Blue:** Represents faith and loyalty\n* **Black:** Represents mourning and grief\n* **Green:** Represents nature and fertility\n\n**Early History**\n----------------\n\n### Pre-medieval Origins\n\nThe origins of tartan patterns date back to pre-medieval times, with evidence suggesting that the first tartans were created by the ancient Celts. These early patterns were likely used for decorative purposes, and were often associated with spiritual and mystical beliefs.\n\n### Medieval\n\nDuring the medieval period, tartan patterns became a key aspect of Scottish culture and identity. The tartan was used to identify different clans and families, and was often displayed on clothing and other textiles. The tartan was also used as a form of communication, with specific patterns and colors used to convey messages and express allegiance.\n\n### 16th century\n\nThe 16th century saw a significant increase in the use of tartan patterns, particularly among the Scottish nobility. The tartan was used to display wealth and status, with elaborate and intricate patterns becoming increasingly popular.\n\n### 17th century\n\nDuring the 17th century, the tartan became a key aspect of Scottish military culture. The tartan was used to identify different regiments and units, and was often displayed on uniforms and other military equipment.\n\n### 18th century\n\nThe 18th century saw a significant decline in the use of tartan patterns, particularly among the Scottish nobility. The tartan was seen as a symbol of Jacobitism, and was associated with the failed rebellion of 1745. The tartan was also seen as a symbol of Scottish identity, and was often used to express national pride.\n\n### Union Protest and Jacobite Rebellion\n\nThe Act of Union in 1707 saw the Scottish Parliament abolished, and Scotland became part of the Kingdom of Great Britain. This led to a significant decrease in the use of tartan patterns, as they were seen as a symbol of Scottish identity and resistance to the union. The Jacobite rebellion of 1745 saw the tartan used as a symbol of Jacobite loyalty, and led to a significant increase in the use of tartan patterns among the Scottish nobility.\n\n### Proscription and its Aftermath\n\nThe Proscription Act of 1746 saw the tartan banned, and the wearing of tartan patterns punishable by law. This led to a significant decrease in the use of tartan patterns, particularly among the Scottish nobility. However, the tartan continued to be used in secret, and was often displayed in hidden ways.\n\n**Regimental Tartans**\n--------------------\n\n### Early Adoption\n\nThe first regimental tartans were adopted in the 18th century, with the 42nd Regiment of Foot being the first to adopt a tartan pattern. The tartan was used to identify different regiments and units, and was often displayed on uniforms and other military equipment.\n\n### Late Adoption\n\nThe adoption of regimental tartans continued throughout the 19th century, with many regiments adopting their own unique tartan patterns. The tartan was used to identify different regiments and units, and was often displayed on uniforms and other military equipment.\n\n### Recognition by Clan Chiefs\n\nThe recognition of clan chiefs by the British government in the 19th century led to a significant increase in the use of tartan patterns among the Scottish nobility. The tartan was used to display wealth and status, and was often displayed on clothing and other textiles.\n\n**Modern General Use**\n---------------------\n\n### Late Georgian\n\nThe late Georgian period saw a significant increase in the use of tartan patterns, particularly among the British nobility. The tartan was used to display wealth and status, and was often displayed on clothing and other textiles.\n\n### The King's Jaunt in Tartan\n\nThe King's jaunt in tartan, which took place in the late 18th century, saw the king and his courtiers wearing tartan patterns to express their Scottish heritage. This led to a significant increase in the use of tartan patterns among the British nobility.\n\n### Civilian Spread\n\nThe civilian spread of tartan patterns in the late Georgian period saw the tartan becoming more widely available and accepted. The tartan was used to display wealth and status, and was often displayed on clothing and other textiles.\n\n**Victorian**\n------------\n\n### Vestiarium Scoticum\n\nThe Vestiarium Scoticum, a book published in 1842, saw the first comprehensive collection of Scottish tartan patterns.

He is one of the most influential filmmakers of the 20th century, known for his innovative and provocative style, which has had a significant impact on world cinema. Born on December 3, 1930, in Paris, France, Godard began his career as a film critic, writing for the influential magazine _Cahiers du Cinéma_, before transitioning to filmmaking.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nGodard was born into a middle-class family in Paris, France. His parents, Paul and Odile Godard, were both from the French bourgeoisie. Godard's early life was marked by a keen interest in film, which was encouraged by his parents. He attended the Lycée Carnot in Paris, where he developed a passion for literature and philosophy. After completing his secondary education, Godard went on to study philosophy at the Sorbonne, where he began to develop his ideas about film and its relationship to society.\n\n**Early Career (1950–1959)**\n\n### Film Criticism\n\nGodard's early career as a film critic began in the early 1950s, when he started writing for the _Cahiers du Cinéma_. This influential magazine, founded in 1951, was a hub for young film critics and directors, including François Truffaut, Éric Rohmer, and Claude Chabrol. Godard's writing style was characterized by his passion and energy, as well as his desire to challenge traditional notions of film criticism. He was particularly interested in the work of directors such as Fritz Lang, Alfred Hitchcock, and Orson Welles, which he saw as exemplifying the potential of film as an art form.\n\n### Filmmaking\n\nGodard's first forays into filmmaking began in the late 1950s, when he started making short films and working as a screenwriter for other directors. One of his earliest films, _Operation Betelgeuse_ (1959), was a short documentary that explored the theme of space exploration. This early work would lay the groundwork for Godard's future experiments with non-narrative and avant-garde filmmaking.\n\n**New Wave period (1960–1967)**\n\nGodard's breakthrough as a filmmaker came with the release of _Breathless_ (1960), which he co-wrote with François Truffaut and Éric Rohmer. This film, which tells the story of a car thief and his American girlfriend, was a key work of the French New Wave, a movement that emerged in the early 1960s and sought to challenge traditional notions of film narrative and style. Godard's next film, _Vivre sa vie_ (1962), was a more personal and experimental work, which explored the theme of prostitution and the dehumanizing effects of modern society.\n\n**Breathless**\n\n_Breathless_ was a key work of the French New Wave, and it marked a significant departure from traditional narrative filmmaking. The film's non-linear structure, use of location shooting, and emphasis on visual style were all innovative elements that influenced a generation of filmmakers. Godard's collaboration with lead actor Jean-Paul Belmondo and cinematographer Raoul Coutard resulted in a film that was both stylish and intellectually challenging.\n\n**Early work with Anna Karina**\n\nGodard's next film, _Le petit soldat_ (1960), was a more personal and experimental work, which explored the theme of terrorism and the role of the individual in society. This film marked the beginning of Godard's long collaboration with actress Anna Karina, who would become a key figure in his work over the next several decades.\n\n**Vivre sa vie**\n\n_Vivre sa vie_ was a more introspective and philosophical work than Godard's previous films, and it marked a significant departure from the narrative filmmaking of _Breathless_. The film's use of long takes, location shooting, and non-narrative structure was all part of a larger experiment with the potential of film as an art form.\n\n**Le petit soldat and Les Carabiniers**\n\n_Godard's next film, _Le petit soldat_ (1960), was a more personal and experimental work, which explored the theme of terrorism and the role of the individual in society. This film marked the beginning of Godard's long collaboration with actress Anna Karina, who would become a key figure in his work over the next several decades. Godard's next film, _Les Carabiniers_ (1963), was a more satirical work, which used the genre of the war film to comment on the dehumanizing effects of modern society.\n\n**Contempt**\n\n_Godard's next film, _Contempt_ (1963), was a more personal and introspective work, which explored the theme of relationships and the role of the individual in society. This film marked a significant departure from Godard's previous work, and it demonstrated his growing interest in the potential of film as an art form.\n\n**Anouchka Films**\n\n_Godard's next film, _Anouchka Films_ (1964), was a more experimental work, which explored the theme of language and identity. This film marked a significant departure from Godard's previous work, and it demonstrated his growing interest in the potential of film as an art form.\n\n**Week End**\n\n_Godard's next film, _Week End_ (1967), was a more satirical work, which used the genre of the road movie to comment on the dehumanizing effects of modern society.

This collaboration took many forms, including military, economic, and ideological cooperation.\n\n**Terminology**\n\nThe term \"collaboration\" can be interpreted in different ways, depending on the context and perspective. In a broad sense, collaboration refers to any form of cooperation or assistance provided to the Axis powers, regardless of whether it was voluntary or involuntary. However, some scholars and historians distinguish between different types of collaboration, such as active collaboration, passive collaboration, and forced collaboration.\n\n**Collaboration in Western Europe**\n\nSeveral Western European countries collaborated with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy during World War II.\n\n### **Belgium**\n\nBelgium's collaboration with Nazi Germany was facilitated by the country's fascist and nationalist movements, which sympathized with the Axis powers' ideology. The Belgian government, led by King Leopold III, signed the Armistice of 22 May 1940, which effectively ceded control of the country to Germany. Many Belgians collaborated with the German occupation, including the formation of the Vlaams Nationaal Verbond (Flemish National Union) and the Volksfront (People's Front), which worked closely with the Nazi authorities.\n\n### **British Channel Islands**\n\nThe British Channel Islands, which include Jersey, Guernsey, and Sark, were occupied by Germany from 1940 to 1945. Although the islands were not part of the UK, the British government maintained a degree of control over them. However, the islands' authorities and residents collaborated with the German occupation, including the formation of a local police force and the provision of economic support to the German authorities.\n\n### **Denmark**\n\nDenmark's collaboration with Nazi Germany was facilitated by the country's fascist and nationalist movements, which sympathized with the Axis powers' ideology. The Danish government, led by Prime Minister Erik Scavenius, signed the Treaty of Copenhagen in 1940, which effectively ceded control of the country to Germany. Many Danes collaborated with the German occupation, including the formation of the Dansk Samling (Danish Union) and the Dansk Fædrelandsparti (Danish Fatherland Party), which worked closely with the Nazi authorities.\n\n### **France**\n\nFrance's collaboration with Nazi Germany was facilitated by the country's fascist and nationalist movements, which sympathized with the Axis powers' ideology. The French government, led by Marshal Philippe Pétain, signed the Armistice of 22 June 1940, which effectively ceded control of the country to Germany. Many French collaborated with the German occupation, including the formation of the Milice française (French Militia) and the Rassemblement national populaire (National Popular Rally), which worked closely with the Nazi authorities.\n\n#### **Vichy France**\n\nVichy France, which was the name given to the collaborationist government of France, was established in 1940 and was led by Marshal Philippe Pétain. The Vichy government collaborated closely with the German occupation, including the implementation of anti-Semitic laws and the persecution of French Jews.\n\n#### **Collaborationist movements**\n\nSeveral collaborationist movements emerged in France during World War II, including the Milice française (French Militia) and the Rassemblement national populaire (National Popular Rally). These movements worked closely with the Nazi authorities and were responsible for the persecution of French Jews and other minority groups.\n\n#### **Uniformed collaboration**\n\nMany French citizens collaborated with the German occupation by joining the uniformed services of the Vichy government, including the Milice française and the Chasseurs alpins. These services worked closely with the Nazi authorities and were responsible for the enforcement of anti-Semitic laws and the persecution of French Jews.\n\n#### **Communist party**\n\nThe French Communist Party (PCF) collaborated with the Nazi authorities in 1940, despite its earlier opposition to fascism. The PCF's collaboration was facilitated by the party's leader, Maurice Thorez, who was a close ally of the Soviet Union and saw the Nazi occupation as a threat to French communism.\n\n#### **French workers for Germany**\n\nMany French workers collaborated with the German occupation by working in German factories and industries. These workers were often forced to work in harsh conditions and were responsible for producing war materials for the German military.\n\n#### **Vichy collaboration in the Holocaust**\n\nThe Vich", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

This phenomenon marked one of the first major wave of UFO sightings in modern history and captured the attention of the general public, media, and government agencies.\n\n**Overview**\n\nThe 1947 flying disc craze was a widespread and intense period of UFO sightings that began in June 1947 and continued through the summer months. Reports of flying discs or saucers were made by people from various walks of life, including private citizens, military personnel, and government officials. The sightings were characterized by descriptions of disk-shaped objects, often with a metallic appearance, flying at high speeds and performing unusual maneuvers.\n\n**Events of Summer 1947**\n\n### **Initial Reports**\n\nThe first reported sighting of a flying disc in 1947 occurred on June 24, 1947, when a private pilot named Kenneth Arnold spotted nine disk-shaped objects flying in formation over Mount Rainier, Washington. Arnold's sighting was not initially reported to the authorities, but it sparked a wave of media attention and public interest in the phenomenon.\n\n### **Additional Reports**\n\nOver the next few weeks, reports of flying discs poured in from around the country. On July 2, 1947, a group of people in Washington state reported seeing a flying disc land in a field, while on July 3, 1947, a farmer in Idaho claimed to have seen a flying disc hovering over his farm. These reports, along with Arnold's initial sighting, created a sense of excitement and curiosity among the public.\n\n### **Pacific Northwest Reports amid Jet Speculation**\n\nThe Pacific Northwest region of the United States saw a disproportionate number of flying disc sightings during the summer of 1947. Many of these reports were attributed to the presence of jet aircraft in the area, which were being tested by the US military. However, the sightings persisted, leading some to speculate that the objects were not ordinary aircraft.\n\n### **Reports throughout the West**\n\nReports of flying discs were not limited to the Pacific Northwest. Sightings were also reported in California, Arizona, and other western states. These reports often described disk-shaped objects flying at high speeds and performing unusual maneuvers, such as hovering and taking off vertically.\n\n### **Potential Explanations Offered**\n\nAs the flying disc craze gained momentum, various explanations were offered to explain the phenomenon. Some suggested that the objects were experimental aircraft or drones being tested by the military, while others believed that they might be extraterrestrial spacecraft. The US government initially remained silent on the issue, but as the sightings continued, they began to take a more active role in investigating the phenomenon.\n\n### **Increasing Prominence**\n\nAs the summer of 1947 wore on, the flying disc craze reached new heights of prominence. On July 4, 1947, the New York Times ran a front-page story on the sightings, which helped to further fuel public interest.\n\n### **Lt. Governor Sighting followed by Official Investigation**\n\nOn July 5, 1947, the Lieutenant Governor of Texas, John Lee Smith, reported seeing a flying disc while driving to work. This sighting was notable because it involved a high-ranking government official, and it led to an official investigation by the Texas State Police.\n\n### **San Francisco Fireworks and Stories of Landings**\n\nOn July 6, 1947, a group of people in San Francisco reported seeing a flying disc land in a field. This sighting was not confirmed, but it helped to fuel speculation about the possibility of extraterrestrial life.\n\n### **July 4 Press Reports**\n\nOn July 4, 1947, a series of press reports emerged about flying discs, including a story by the New York Times that highlighted the sightings in the Pacific Northwest.\n\n### **Flight 105**\n\nOn July 4, 1947, a group of people in North Dakota reported seeing a flying disc hovering over a field. This sighting was notable because it involved a group of people who claimed to have seen the object up close.\n\n### **Group Sightings**\n\nAs the summer of 1947 wore on, group sightings of flying discs became more common. These sightings often involved multiple people who claimed to have seen the object at the same time.\n\n### **Atomic Link Claimed**\n\nSome people claimed that the flying discs were connected to the development of atomic bombs, which were being tested in the United States at the time.\n\n### **Reports Peak**\n\nThe number of flying disc sightings peaked in August 1947, with reports coming in from all over the country.\n\n## **Weather Balloons, Pranks, and Hoaxes**\n\nAs the flying disc craze continued, some people began to question the authenticity of the sightings. On August 8, 1947, a group of pranksters in New Mexico claimed to have recovered a flying disc, which turned out to be a weather balloon.\n\n### **Roswell Debris**\n\nOn July 8, 1947, a rancher in Roswell, New Mexico reported finding debris from a flying disc. This sighting was notable because it involved a group of military personnel who claimed to have recovered the debris. However, the military later retracted their statement, fueling speculation about a government cover-up.\n\n### **Reports Diminish**\n\nAs the summer of 1947 wore on, the number of flying disc sightings began to diminish. This was likely due to a combination of factors, including the fact that the initial wave of sightings had died down and the public's interest had begun to wane.\n\n### **Hoaxed Discs Recovered in Hollywood and Detroit**\n\nOn August 13, 1947, a group of people in Hollywood claimed to have recovered a flying disc, which turned out to be a hoax. Similarly, on August 15, 1947, a group of people in Detroit claimed to have recovered a flying disc, which also turned out to be a hoax.\n\n### **Balloons**\n\nSome of the flying disc sightings were later attributed to weather balloons or other types of aircraft.\n\n### **Twin Falls Recovered Disc Hoax**\n\nOn August 16, 1947, a group of people in Twin Falls, Idaho claimed to have recovered a flying disc, which turned out to be a hoax.\n\n## **Reports Subside**\n\nBy the end of August 1947, the number of flying disc sightings had subsided, and the public's interest had begun to wane.\n\n### **Crash at Kelso**\n\nOn August 20, 1947, a group of people in Kelso, Washington reported seeing a flying disc crash into a field. This sighting was notable because it involved a group of people who claimed to have seen the object up close.\n\n## **Public Awareness**\n\nThe flying disc craze of 1947 raised public awareness of the possibility of extraterrestrial life and sparked a wave of interest in the phenomenon.\n\n## **Maps and Table of Reports**\n\nThe following maps and table of reports provide a visual representation of the flying disc sightings in 1947.\n\n**Contemporary Interpretations**\n\n### **Technological**\n\nSome people believed that the flying discs were experimental aircraft or drones being tested by the military.\n\n### **Conventional**\n\nOthers believed that the objects were conventional aircraft or balloons that had been misidentified.\n\n### **Behavioral**\n\nSome people suggested that the flying discs were a manifestation of mass hysteria or a collective psychological phenomenon.\n\n### **Interplanetary**\n\nA small but vocal group believed that the flying discs were extraterrestrial spacecraft, and that they were evidence of the existence of alien life.\n\n### **Biological**\n\nSome people suggested that the flying discs were biological in nature, and that they were a type of organism that had been discovered in the natural world.\n\n### **Eschatological**\n\nA few people believed that the flying discs were a sign of the end times, and that they were a harbinger of doom.\n\n### **Occult**\n\nSome people believed that the flying discs were connected to occult or mystical forces, and that they were a manifestation of the unknown.\n\n### **Esoteric**\n\nA few people believed that the flying discs were connected to esoteric or spiritual forces, and that they were a manifestation of the divine.\n\n## **Aftermath**\n\nThe flying disc craze of 1947 had a lasting impact on popular culture, and it helped to fuel public interest in the phenomenon of UFOs. The incident also sparked a wave of government investigations into the possibility of extraterrestrial life.\n\n### **Flying Saucer Conspiracy Theories**\n\nThe flying disc craze of 1947 helped to fuel a wave of conspiracy theories about the government's involvement in the phenomenon.\n\n### **Roswell Conspiracy Theory**\n\nThe incident at Roswell, New Mexico has become one of the most enduring conspiracy theories of all time, with many people believing that the government has been covering up the existence of extraterrestrial life.\n\n### **Project Mogul and Skyhook**\n\nThe flying disc craze of 1947 was also linked to two other government projects, Project Mogul and Skyhook, which were designed to detect and track objects in the upper atmosphere.\n\n# **See Also**\n\n* UFO\n* Extraterrestrial life\n* Government cover-up\n* Roswell UFO incident\n\n# **Further Reading**\n\n* \"The Flying Disc Story\" by R.D.

G. Ramachandran (MGR). It is one of the two main Dravidian parties in Tamil Nadu, along with the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK). The AIADMK is a regional party that has been a dominant force in Tamil Nadu politics for several decades.\n\n**Ideology and policies**\n\n### Culture\n\nThe AIADMK has a strong cultural ethos that emphasizes the importance of Tamil language, literature, and culture. The party has been a vocal advocate for the promotion of Tamil language and culture, and has supported various initiatives to preserve and promote Tamil heritage. The party's cultural policies have been shaped by MGR's vision of a modern, inclusive, and proud Tamil identity.\n\n### Economy\n\nThe AIADMK has traditionally been a party that emphasizes the importance of economic development, particularly in the context of Tamil Nadu. The party has supported various initiatives to promote industrialization, infrastructure development, and social welfare programs. The AIADMK has also been a strong advocate for special status for Tamil Nadu, seeking greater autonomy and financial support from the central government.\n\n### Social justice\n\nThe AIADMK has a strong commitment to social justice, particularly in the context of the Dravidian movement's ideals of equality and social reform. The party has supported various initiatives to promote women's empowerment, education, and social welfare, particularly in rural areas. The AIADMK has also been a vocal advocate for the rights of marginalized communities, including the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.\n\n### State water policy\n\nThe AIADMK has a long history of advocating for a robust and equitable water policy in Tamil Nadu. The party has supported various initiatives to promote water conservation, water management, and irrigation projects. The AIADMK has also been a vocal critic of the government's handling of water resources, particularly in the context of the Cauvery River water dispute with Karnataka.\n\n### Environment and nature\n\nThe AIADMK has a strong commitment to environmental protection and conservation. The party has supported various initiatives to promote renewable energy, reduce pollution, and protect natural habitats. The AIADMK has also been a vocal advocate for the preservation of Tamil Nadu's natural heritage, including its forests, wildlife, and coastal ecosystems.\n\n**History**\n\n### M. G. Ramachandran era (1972–87)\n\nM. G. Ramachandran (MGR) founded the AIADMK in 1972, after splitting from the DMK. MGR was a charismatic leader and a former film star, who had a wide following in Tamil Nadu. Under MGR's leadership, the AIADMK quickly became a major force in Tamil Nadu politics, winning several seats in the state assembly elections. MGR served as the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu from 1977 to 1980 and again from 1980 to 1987.\n\n### Succession conflict between the Janaki and Jayalalithaa factions\n\nAfter MGR's death in 1987, there was a succession crisis within the AIADMK. Jayalalithaa, a close associate of MGR, emerged as a strong contender for the party leadership. However, Janaki Ramachandran, MGR's wife, also claimed the leadership of the party. The Janaki faction was eventually expelled from the party, and Jayalalithaa became the leader of the AIADMK.\n\n### J. Jayalalithaa era (1989–2016)\n\nJayalalithaa became the leader of the AIADMK in 1989 and served as the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu from 1991 to 1996 and again from 2001 to 2006 and from 2011 to 2015. During her tenure, the AIADMK expanded its presence beyond Tamil Nadu, winning several seats in the Lok Sabha and state assembly elections in other states.\n\n### Expansion beyond Tamil Nadu and Puducherry\n\nUnder Jayalalithaa's leadership, the AIADMK expanded its presence beyond Tamil Nadu, winning several seats in the Lok Sabha and state assembly elections in other states. The party also formed governments in Puducherry and Andhra Pradesh.\n\n**V. K. Sasikala and T. T. V. Dhinakaran era (2016–17)**\n\nAfter Jayalalithaa's death in 2016, V. K. Sasikala, a close associate of Jayalalithaa, emerged as the leader of the AIADMK. However, T. T. V. Dhinakaran, Sasikala's nephew, also claimed the leadership of the party. The Sasikala faction was eventually expelled from the party, and the AIADMK was reunited under the leadership of Edappadi K. Palaniswami.\n\n### Expulsion of V. K. Sasikala and T. T. V. Dhinakaran\n\nThe Sasikala faction was eventually expelled from the party, and the AIADMK was reunited under the leadership of Edappadi K. Palaniswami.\n\n**O. Panneerselvam and Edappadi K. Palaniswami era (2017–22)**\n\nAfter the expulsion of Sasikala and Dhinakaran, O. Panneerselvam, a senior leader of the AIADMK, emerged as a contender for the party leadership. However, Edappadi K. Palaniswami eventually became the leader of the party. During his tenure, the AIADMK continued to face challenges from within and outside the party.\n\n### Legal fight for the party by V. K. Sasikala and T. T. V. Dhinakaran\n\nThe Sasikala faction continued to fight for the leadership of the party, even after being expelled.\n\n### Tensions with BJP\n\nThe AIADMK has traditionally been a non-BJP party, but during the tenure of Edappadi K. Palaniswami, there were tensions between the two parties.\n\n### Leadership tussle between O. Panneerselvam and Edappadi K. Palaniswami\n\nThere was a leadership tussle between O. Panneerselvam and Edappadi K. Palaniswami, which ultimately led to the resurgence of Edappadi K. Palaniswami as the leader of the party.\n\n**Edappadi K. Palaniswami era (2022–present)**\n\nEdappadi K. Palaniswami has continued to lead the AIADMK since 2022, and the party is currently facing new challenges and opportunities.\n\n**Electoral performance**\n\n### Indian general elections\n\nThe AIADMK has participated in several Indian general elections, winning several seats in the Lok Sabha.\n\n### State legislative assembly elections\n\nThe AIADMK has participated in several state legislative assembly elections, winning several seats in the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly.\n\n**Current office bearers and prominent members**\n\nThe AIADMK has several prominent members, including Edappadi K.

The day is observed on March 8 every year and is marked by events, rallies, and campaigns to promote women's rights and gender equality.\n\n**History**\n\n### Origins\n\nThe modern International Women's Day has its roots in the labor movement of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In 1908, 15,000 women marched through the streets of New York City demanding better pay, shorter hours, and voting rights. The following year, the Socialist Party of America declared the first National Woman's Day, which was observed on February 28.\n\n### The Russian Revolution and Communist countries\n\nThe first true International Women's Day was celebrated on March 8, 1911, in Denmark, Austria, Switzerland, and Germany. The event was organized by the Socialist International and was a call to action for women's suffrage and labor rights. In 1917, the Russian Revolution brought about a significant shift in the status of women in Russia. The Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin, introduced policies to promote women's rights and equality.\n\n### Other countries, 1920s to 1960s\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, International Women's Day was celebrated in countries such as China, Japan, and India. The event gained popularity in the 1950s and 1960s, as the women's liberation movement gained momentum. In the United States, the National Organization for Women (NOW) was founded in 1966, and the first National Women's Strike was held in 1970.\n\n### Second–wave feminism\n\nThe second wave of feminism, which emerged in the 1960s and 1970s, brought about significant changes in the way women's rights were perceived. The movement focused on issues such as reproductive rights, equal pay, and violence against women. International Women's Day became a key event in the feminist calendar, with marches, rallies, and protests taking place around the world.\n\n### Adoption by United Nations\n\nIn 1975, the United Nations declared International Women's Day a global holiday, and it has been observed by the UN every year since then. The UN has used the day to highlight issues such as poverty, education, and health, and has called for action to promote women's rights and empowerment.\n\n### Adoption by corporations\n\nIn recent years, International Women's Day has been adopted by corporations and businesses around the world. Many companies use the day to promote their commitment to gender equality and women's empowerment. Some companies have even introduced policies and initiatives to support women in the workplace, such as paid parental leave and flexible working arrangements.\n\n**International Women's Day by year**\n\n### 1995\n\nIn 1995, International Women's Day was marked by a UN conference in Beijing, China, which brought together women from around the world to discuss issues such as poverty, education, and health.

It was a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that involved theological, institutional, and social changes. The Reformation had far-reaching consequences, shaping the course of Western history and leaving a lasting legacy.\n\n**Terminology**\n\nThe term \"Reformation\" was first used by Martin Luther in 1530 to describe the movement he was leading. However, it is also sometimes referred to as the \"Protestant Reformation\" or the \"Great Separation\" to distinguish it from the Catholic Church's own reforms. The term \"Counter-Reformation\" is used to describe the Catholic Church's response to the Reformation.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Reformation was a response to various problems within the late medieval Christian Church. Some of the key issues that contributed to the Reformation include:\n\n### **Calamities**\n\nThe 14th and 15th centuries were marked by a series of calamities that affected Europe, including the Black Death, which killed millions of people, and the Hundred Years' War, which devastated France and England. These calamities weakened the Church's authority and created a sense of crisis.\n\n### **Late Medieval Christianity**\n\nThe late medieval Christian Church was characterized by a decline in spiritual vitality, a rise in corruption, and a growing sense of disillusionment. The Church's wealth and power had become excessive, and its clergy were often seen as more interested in material gain than in spiritual matters.\n\n#### **Institutions**\n\nThe Catholic Church's institutional structure was highly centralized, with the Pope and the Roman Curia holding immense power. This led to a sense of remoteness and disconnection between the Church and its members.\n\n#### **Clergy**\n\nThe clergy were often seen as corrupt and worldly, with many holding multiple positions and accumulating wealth. The sale of indulgences and other forms of simony became widespread, further eroding the clergy's credibility.\n\n#### **Papacy**\n\nThe Papacy was seen as increasingly arbitrary and authoritarian, with the Pope wielding absolute power over the Church.

They were a powerful and influential people in the region from the 4th century BCE to the 1st century CE, playing a significant role in the history of the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe name \"Samnites\" is derived from the ancient Italic word \"sammu\", which means \"highlander\" or \"mountaineer\". The Samnites were a mountain-dwelling people, inhabiting the Apennine Mountains and the surrounding regions.\n\n**History**\n\n### Origins and early history\n\nThe origins of the Samnites are shrouded in mystery, but it is believed that they descended from the ancient Italic peoples who inhabited the region before the arrival of the Greeks and the Romans. The Samnites were a confederation of various tribes, each with their own distinct culture and traditions. They were a fiercely independent people, living in small communities and relying on agriculture, livestock, and trade to sustain themselves.\n\n### Samnite Wars\n\nThe Samnites were known for their bravery and military prowess, and they frequently clashed with the Romans during the 4th and 3rd centuries BCE. The first Samnite War (343-341 BCE) was fought over the issue of the Roman expansion into Campania, which was seen as a threat to Samnite territory. The war ended with the Samnites being defeated, but they continued to resist Roman expansion.\n\nThe second Samnite War (327-304 BCE) was more extensive, involving many of the tribes of central and southern Italy. The war was marked by several major battles, including the Battle of the Caudine Forks, which was a decisive Roman victory. The war ended with the signing of the Treaty of the Caudine Forks, which established a fragile peace between the Romans and the Samnites.\n\nThe third Samnite War (298-290 BCE) was sparked by the Roman expansion into Samnite territory and the imposition of Roman taxes and laws on the Samnite people. The war was marked by several major battles, including the Battle of Sentinum, which was a decisive Roman victory. The war ended with the signing of the Treaty of Preneste, which established a fragile peace between the Romans and the Samnites.\n\n### Later history\n\nThe Samnites continued to resist Roman expansion throughout the 3rd and 2nd centuries BCE, but they were ultimately defeated and incorporated into the Roman Republic. The Samnites were granted citizenship and became an integral part of Roman society, contributing to the development of Roman culture and politics.\n\nDuring the 1st century CE, the Samnites were influenced by Christianity, and many of them converted to the new faith. The Samnites continued to play a significant role in the Roman Empire, contributing to the development of Roman law, architecture, and art.\n\n**Society**\n\n### Economy\n\nThe Samnites were an agricultural society, relying on crops such as wheat, barley, and olives to sustain themselves. They were also skilled herders, raising cattle, sheep, and goats for meat, milk, and wool. The Samnites were traders, exchanging goods such as wine, oil, and pottery with other tribes and civilizations.\n\n### Government\n\nThe Samnites were a confederation of various tribes, each with their own distinct culture and traditions. They were governed by a system of councils and assemblies, with each tribe having its own leader or chieftain. The Samnites were known for their democratic traditions, with power held by the people rather than by a monarch or aristocracy.\n\n### Military\n\n#### Armor\n\nThe Samnites were known for their heavy armor, which consisted of a helmet, breastplate, and greaves. They were skilled metalworkers, crafting their armor from iron and bronze. The Samnites were also known for their expertise in archery, using bows and arrows to devastating effect on the battlefield.\n\n#### Weaponry\n\nThe Samnites were skilled warriors, using a variety of weapons including swords, spears, and slings. They were known for their bravery and military prowess, and their armies were feared by their enemies. The Samnites were skilled in the art of hand-to-hand combat, using techniques such as wrestling and boxing to devastating effect.\n\n**Culture**\n\n### Religion\n\nThe Samnites were polytheistic, worshiping a variety of gods and goddesses including Jupiter, Mars, and Venus. They were known for their reverence for the natural world, and their worship of the gods was often tied to the cycles of nature. The Samnites were also known for their fertility rituals, which were designed to ensure the fertility of the land and the health of their people.\n\n### Gender roles\n\nThe Samnites were a patriarchal society, with men holding positions of power and authority. Women were expected to play a subordinate role, managing the household and caring for children. However, women were also known for their independence and strength, and many of them played important roles in Samnite society.\n\n### Art\n\nThe Samnites were skilled artisans, creating a variety of works including pottery, sculpture, and metalwork. They were known for their intricate designs and patterns, which were often used to adorn their homes and public buildings. The Samnites were also skilled in the art of mosaic, using small pieces of stone and glass to create intricate and beautiful images.\n\n### Clothing\n\nThe Samnites were known for their distinctive clothing, which was often made from wool and linen. They wore long tunics and cloaks, which were often decorated with intricate patterns and designs. The Samnites were also known for their love of jewelry, which was often made from gold and silver.\n\n### Recreation\n\nThe Samnites were a pleasure-loving people, enjoying a variety of recreational activities including sports, music, and dance. They were known for their love of festivals and celebrations, which were often held to mark important occasions such as weddings and harvests.\n\n### Cities and engineering\n\nThe Samnites were skilled engineers, building a variety of cities and public buildings including roads, bridges, and aqueducts.

The search was the culmination of a months-long investigation by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) and the Department of Justice (DOJ), which had been examining Trump's retention of classified and presidential records at Mar-a-Lago following his presidency.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Handling, Storage, and Disposition of U.S. Government Records\n\nThe National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) is responsible for managing and preserving the records of the U.S. government, including those of the President. Under the Presidential Records Act of 1978, presidential records are considered federal property and are subject to certain rules and regulations regarding their handling, storage, and disposition. The Act requires that presidential records be preserved and made available to the public, unless they are exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).\n\n### Criminal Laws Listed on Search Warrant\n\nThe search warrant executed by the FBI cited several federal laws, including 18 U.S.C. § 793(e), which prohibits the unauthorized removal of documents containing national defense information, and 18 U.S.C. § 2071, which prohibits the concealment, removal, mutilation, obliteration, or destruction of records. The warrant also cited 18 U.S.C. § 1519, which prohibits the destruction, alteration, or falsification of records in connection with a federal investigation.\n\n### Classified Material and the Presidency\n\nClassified material is sensitive information that is not publicly available due to national security concerns. As President, Trump had access to classified information, which he was required to handle in accordance with security protocols. The Presidential Records Act requires that classified records be treated as national defense information and be handled accordingly.\n\n#### Declassification, Presidential Powers, and Regulations\n\nAs President, Trump had the authority to declassify national security information, but he was required to follow established procedures and guidelines. The Presidential Library Act of 1986 requires that presidential records, including classified information, be preserved and made available to the public, unless they are exempt from disclosure under the FOIA.\n\n#### Protocols for Loss or Compromise of Classified Material\n\nIn the event of a loss or compromise of classified material, the President and his staff are required to follow established protocols, including notification of the relevant agencies and a review of the incident to determine the cause and extent of the compromise.\n\n**Events Leading to the Search**\n\n### NARA Actions to Retrieve Presidential Records from Mar-a-Lago\n\nIn January 2021, following Trump's presidency, the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) began efforts to retrieve presidential records from Mar-a-Lago. The agency sent a letter to Trump's representatives, requesting that he return all presidential records, including those that were classified. Trump's representatives initially agreed to return some records, but NARA later discovered that many more records were still retained at Mar-a-Lago.\n\n### Partial Return of Records to NARA\n\nIn February 2021, Trump's representatives returned some presidential records to NARA, but the agency determined that many more records were still missing. NARA continued to press Trump's representatives for the return of all presidential records.\n\n### Trump's Statement Regarding Return of Records\n\nIn response to NARA's requests, Trump stated that he had returned all presidential records, but NARA later discovered that this was not the case.\n\n### NARA Makes Criminal Referral\n\nIn May 2021, NARA referred the matter to the Department of Justice (DOJ), which began a criminal investigation into the handling of presidential records at Mar-a-Lago. The investigation was led by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia.\n\n### Tom Fitton's Advice to Trump\n\nIn June 2021, Tom Fitton, the president of Judicial Watch, advised Trump to return all presidential records, including those that were classified. Fitton stated that the failure to return these records could result in criminal charges.\n\n**FBI/DOJ Launches Criminal Investigation and Issues Subpoenas**\n\n### May 2022 Subpoena\n\nIn May 2022, the FBI/DOJ issued a subpoena to Trump's representatives, requiring that they produce all presidential records, including those that were classified.\n\n### June 2022 Subpoena\n\nIn June 2022, the FBI/DOJ issued a second subpoena to Trump's representatives, requiring that they produce all presidential records.\n\n**FBI/DOJ Obtains Search Warrant from Federal Court**\n\nIn August 2022, the FBI/DOJ obtained a search warrant from a federal court, authorizing the search of Mar-a-Lago for presidential records.\n\n**Search of Mar-a-Lago**\n\nOn August 8, 2022, the FBI executed the search warrant at Mar-a-Lago, seizing numerous presidential records, including those that were classified.\n\n### Search of Other Trump Properties\n\nThe search warrant also authorized the search of other Trump properties, but it is not clear whether these properties were actually searched.\n\n**Release of Search Warrant, Property Receipt, and Affidavit**\n\nOn August 11, 2022, the FBI released the search warrant, property receipt, and affidavit supporting the search warrant.\n\n### Seized Materials\n\nThe property receipt listed numerous items that were seized during the search, including presidential records, documents, and electronic devices.\n\n### Missing Materials\n\nThe property receipt also listed items that were not seized during the search, including a safe that contained classified information.\n\n**Motions to Release Search Warrant Affidavit**\n\nOn August 19, 2022, Trump's attorneys filed a motion to release the search warrant affidavit, arguing that the public had a right to know the details of the search.\n\n### Release of Redacted Search Warrant Affidavit\n\nOn August 22, 2022, the court released a redacted version of the search warrant affidavit, which provided some details about the search.\n\n### Release of Detailed Property List\n\nOn August 25, 2022, the FBI released a detailed property list of the items that were seized during the search.\n\n**Trump v.

The fort played a significant role in the history of the United States, serving as a military outpost, a commercial center, and a cultural hub. This article will provide an in-depth examination of the history of Fort Amsterdam, from its establishment in 1621 to its eventual abandonment in 1790.\n\n**History**\n\n### Establishment (1621–1660)\n\nFort Amsterdam was founded on April 3, 1621, by the Dutch West India Company, a Dutch trading company that was granted a charter to establish a colony in the New World. The fort was built on the southern tip of Manhattan Island, which was then known as \"Mannahatta\" by the Lenape Native American tribe. The fort was designed to protect the Dutch settlement and to facilitate trade with the Native Americans. The fort's early years were marked by conflict with the English and the Dutch West India Company's rivals, the Swedish.\n\nDuring the early 17th century, Fort Amsterdam was the center of Dutch colonial power in North America. The fort was a major commercial center, with merchants trading in goods such as furs, tobacco, and textiles. The fort's military garrison was responsible for defending the colony against English and Native American raids. In 1630, the Dutch West India Company established a formal government in New Amsterdam, with the fort serving as the seat of power.\n\n### English rule (1664–1673)\n\nIn 1664, the English took control of New Amsterdam from the Dutch, renaming it New York after the Duke of York, later King James II. The English renamed Fort Amsterdam \"Fort James\" and installed a British governor, James Graham. The English rule was marked by a significant decline in the fort's military importance, as the British focused on establishing a naval presence in the Caribbean and in North America.\n\nDuring this period, the fort's economic importance continued to grow, with the establishment of a thriving trade in goods such as sugar, tobacco, and rum. The fort's commercial success was fueled by the growth of the British Empire, which provided a vast market for New York's goods. However, the fort's Native American relations deteriorated, with the English engaging in a series of bloody conflicts with the Lenape and other Native American tribes.\n\n### Dutch rule (1673–1674)\n\nIn 1673, the Dutch recaptured New Amsterdam from the English, and Fort Amsterdam was restored to its original name. The Dutch rule was short-lived, as the English recaptured the colony in 1674. The brief period of Dutch rule had a lasting impact on the fort's architecture, as the Dutch added a number of buildings and fortifications to the complex.\n\n### English rule (1674–1689)\n\nDuring this period, the fort's military importance continued to decline, as the British focused on establishing a naval presence in the Caribbean and in North America. However, the fort's economic importance continued to grow, with the establishment of a thriving trade in goods such as sugar, tobacco, and rum. The fort's commercial success was fueled by the growth of the British Empire, which provided a vast market for New York's goods.\n\n### Colonist rule (1689–1691)\n\nIn 1689, the English granted a charter to William Penn, a Quaker leader, to establish a colony in the New World. Penn's colony, known as Pennsylvania, was established on the west bank of the Delaware River, and Fort Amsterdam was transferred to the Penn family. The Penns used the fort as a base for their colonial activities, including trade and diplomacy with the Native Americans.\n\n### British rule (1691–1775)\n\nIn 1691, the British took control of Pennsylvania from the Penns, and Fort Amsterdam was returned to British control. The fort's military importance continued to decline, as the British focused on establishing a naval presence in the Caribbean and in North America. However, the fort's economic importance continued to grow, with the establishment of a thriving trade in goods such as sugar, tobacco, and rum.\n\n### Prelude to the revolution\n\nDuring the early 18th century, tensions between the British and the American colonists began to rise, fueled by a series of taxes and regulations imposed by the British government. The colonists, who were primarily merchants and traders, saw these taxes and regulations as an attack on their economic interests and their way of life.\n\n### Colonist rule (1775–1776)\n\nIn 1775, the American Revolutionary War began, and Fort Amsterdam was occupied by the Continental Army. The fort was used as a base for the American forces, who engaged in a series of battles with the British in the surrounding area. The fort's military importance continued to grow, as the Americans used it as a key location for their military operations.\n\n### British rule (1776–1783)\n\nIn 1776, the British recaptured Fort Amsterdam from the Americans, and the fort was used as a base for the British forces. The fort's military importance continued to grow, as the British used it as a key location for their military operations.\n\n### American rule (1783–1790)\n\nIn 1783, the American Revolution ended, and Fort Amsterdam was returned to American control. The fort's military importance continued to decline, as the United States government focused on establishing a new national capital in the District of Columbia. The fort was eventually abandoned, and its remains were used as a quarry for building materials.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Fort James\n* New Amsterdam\n* New York City\n* New York\n* American Revolutionary War\n* British Empire\n* Dutch West India Company\n* Swedish Empire\n* Lenape Native American tribe\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The history of Fort Amsterdam is complex and multifaceted, and this article provides a general overview of the fort's development and significance.\n* The fort's architecture and design have evolved over time, with various additions and modifications made by different rulers and occupants.\n* The fort's military importance has varied throughout its history, with periods of significant conflict and periods of relative peace.\n\n**Citations**\n\n* This article does not include any citations or references, as the information provided is general knowledge and does not require specific attribution.\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n* Further reading on the history of Fort Amsterdam can be found in the following sources:\n\t+ \"A History of New York\" by Washington Irving\n\t+ \"The Dutch West India Company\" by James R.

The album marks Rodrigo's sophomore effort following her debut album Sour, which was released in 2021 to critical acclaim and commercial success.\n\n**Background**\n\nRodrigo spent several months working on Guts, taking a more experimental and introspective approach to her songwriting. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Rodrigo stated that the album is a reflection of her own personal growth and experiences, saying \"I feel like I've grown up a lot since Sour, and I'm in a different place in my life.\" The album's title, Guts, refers to Rodrigo's willingness to be vulnerable and honest in her songwriting, drawing from her own emotions and experiences.\n\n**Writing and recording**\n\nRodrigo wrote and recorded the majority of Guts in her home studio, experimenting with different sounds and styles. She collaborated with several producers and songwriters, including Dan Nigro, who also worked on Sour. Rodrigo has stated that she wanted to create an album that was more cohesive and thematic than Sour, saying \"I wanted to make an album that was like a collection of short stories, rather than a bunch of individual songs.\"\n\n**Music**\n\nGuts features a diverse range of musical styles, from pop and rock to electronic and R&B. Rodrigo has cited influences such as Fleetwood Mac, The Cure, and Radiohead, and has experimented with different vocal styles and techniques. The album's sound is characterized by its use of distorted guitars, driving beats, and atmospheric synths.\n\n### Lyrics\n\nLyrics on Guts are often introspective and emotionally charged, with Rodrigo exploring themes of love, heartbreak, and self-discovery. Many of the album's songs are autobiographical, drawing from Rodrigo's own experiences and emotions. She has stated that she wants her lyrics to be relatable and honest, saying \"I want people to feel like they're not alone in their feelings.\"\n\n**Release and promotion**\n\nGuts was released on May 5, 2023, to critical acclaim and commercial success. The album's lead single, \"Vampire,\" was released several weeks prior to the album's release, and debuted at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. Rodrigo has promoted the album through various media outlets, including Rolling Stone, The New York Times, and NPR.\n\n### Cover artwork\n\nThe album's cover artwork features a striking image of Rodrigo, taken by photographer Annie Leibovitz. The image shows Rodrigo in a bold, graphic style, with her hair styled in a dramatic fashion. The album's title, Guts, is emblazoned across the cover in bold, red letters.\n\n### Singles\n\nIn addition to \"Vampire,\" Guts has spawned several other singles, including \"Traitor\" and \"Dance the Night Away.\" All of the album's singles have debuted in the top 10 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart.\n\n### Marketing\n\nRodrigo has promoted Guts through various marketing campaigns, including social media teasers and behind-the-scenes footage. She has also performed live at various events and festivals, including Coachella and the Grammy Awards.\n\n### Tour\n\nRodrigo has announced a world tour in support of Guts, which will kick off in the summer of 2023. The tour will visit North America, Europe, and Asia, and will feature special guests and surprise performances.\n\n### Guts: The Secret Tracks\n\nIn addition to the standard edition of Guts, Rodrigo has released a special \"Secret Tracks\" edition of the album, which features several bonus tracks and remixes. The Secret Tracks edition is available exclusively on Rodrigo's website and through certain music retailers.\n\n**Critical reception**\n\nGuts has received widespread critical acclaim, with many reviewers praising Rodrigo's songwriting and vocal performance. The album has been praised for its introspective and emotionally charged lyrics, as well as its diverse and experimental sound. Many critics have noted that Guts is a more mature and introspective work than Rodrigo's debut album, Sour.\n\n### Year-end lists\n\nGuts has appeared on several year-end lists, including Rolling Stone's 50 Best Albums of 2023 and Pitchfork's 50 Best Albums of 2023. The album has also been named one of the best albums of 2023 by The New York Times and NPR.\n\n**Commercial performance**\n\nGuts has debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart, with over 200,000 copies sold in its first week.

Union of India\n\nThe case of Supriyo v. Union of India is a significant landmark decision in Indian law, addressing the rights of sexual and gender minority individuals, particularly with regards to marriage and ancillary rights. The case was heard by the Supreme Court of India and has been a subject of extensive debate and discussion among legal scholars, activists, and the general public.\n\n**Case Summary**\n\nThe case revolves around the petition filed by Supriyo, a sexual minority individual, challenging the constitutional validity of Section 12 of the Special Marriage Act, 1954. This section states that a marriage between two individuals can only be solemnized if both parties are of the same sex. Supriyo argued that this provision violates the fundamental rights guaranteed under the Indian Constitution, particularly the right to equality, freedom of expression, and the right to marry.\n\n**Intervenors**\n\n### Government\n\nThe Union of India, represented by the Attorney General, intervened in the case to defend the constitutionality of Section 12 of the Special Marriage Act.

They argued that the provision is in line with Islamic law and that it is necessary to protect the rights of Muslim individuals.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe case highlights the complexities of marriage laws in India, particularly with regards to sexual and gender minority individuals. In India, marriage is governed by the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937, and the Special Marriage Act, 1954. However, these laws do not recognize same-sex marriages, leaving sexual and gender minority individuals without access to legal marriage.\n\n**Written Arguments**\n\n### Petitioners\n\nSupriyo's petition argued that Section 12 of the Special Marriage Act is unconstitutional because it denies the right to marry to sexual and gender minority individuals. The petitioners also argued that the provision is discriminatory and violates the principles of equality and non-discrimination.\n\n#### Fundamental Rights\n\nThe petitioners argued that the right to marry is a fundamental right guaranteed under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, which protects the right to life and personal liberty.
