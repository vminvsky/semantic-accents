The team's home stadium is the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb, and their head coach is Zlatko Dalić.\n\n**History**\n\nThe Croatian national team was formed in 1990, after Croatia declared its independence from Yugoslavia. Since then, the team has experienced a rollercoaster of success and failure, with a few notable achievements in international competitions.\n\n### Official formation\n\nThe Croatian Football Federation was established in 1911, and the team played its first international match against Hungary in 1912. However, the team's early years were marked by limited success, and they mostly played friendly matches against other European teams.\n\n### Blažević period (1994–1999)\n\nThe modern Croatian national team was formed in 1994, under the guidance of coach Miroslav Blažević. Blažević led the team to their first major international tournament, the 1996 European Championship, where they reached the quarterfinals. The team's performance in the tournament was marked by a stunning 3-1 victory over Portugal, but they ultimately lost to France.\n\n### Jozić, Barić and Kranjčar period (2000–2006)\n\nAfter Blažević's departure, the team was led by a trio of coaches: Mirko Jozić, Tomislav Ivić, and Slaven Bilić. During this period, the team experienced a decline in performance, failing to qualify for the 2002 World Cup and 2004 European Championship.\n\n### Bilić period (2006–2012)\n\nSlaven Bilić took over as coach in 2006 and led the team to a successful qualifying campaign for the 2008 European Championship. However, the team's performance in the tournament was disappointing, and they were eliminated in the group stage. Bilić's tenure was marked by controversy, including a high-profile dispute with the Croatian Football Federation.\n\n### Štimac, Kovač and Čačić period (2012–2017)\n\nAfter Bilić's departure, the team was led by a trio of coaches: Slaven Bilić's assistant, Bruno Akrapović, and then Igor Štimac, Nikola Jurčević, and Ante Čačić. During this period, the team experienced a resurgence in performance, qualifying for the 2014 World Cup and reaching the final of the 2016 European Championship.\n\n### Dalić period (since 2017)\n\nZlatko Dalić took over as coach in 2017 and has led the team to a string of impressive results, including a third-place finish at the 2018 World Cup and a quarterfinal appearance at the 2020 European Championship.\n\n**Image**\n\n### Kits\n\nThe Croatian national team's home kit is a red and white striped shirt, blue shorts, and red socks. The away kit is a white shirt, blue shorts, and white socks.\n\n### Supporters\n\nThe Croatian national team has a dedicated and passionate fan base, known for their creativity and energy. The team's supporters are known as the Vatreni, which translates to \"The Blazing Ones\".\n\n### Charity\n\nThe Croatian Football Federation has partnered with several charitable organizations, including the Croatian Red Cross and the Croatian Children's Fund.\n\n**Stadiums**\n\nThe Croatian national team's home stadium is the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb, which has a seating capacity of over 40,000. The team also plays friendly matches at other stadiums in Croatia, including the Poljud Stadium in Split and the Varteks Stadium in Varaždin.\n\n**Results and fixtures**\n\n### 2023\n\nThe Croatian national team will play several friendly matches in 2023, including matches against Spain, Brazil, and the United States.\n\n### 2024\n\nThe team will also play several qualifying matches for the 2024 European Championship, including matches against the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Bulgaria.\n\n**Management**\n\n### Manager history\n\n| Manager | Years | Matches | Won | Drawn | Lost | Win % |\n| —

The operation began in May 2023, following a strategic decision by the Ukrainian government to launch a counterattack against Russian forces in response to the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\n**Background**\n\n### State of the War\n\nThe ongoing war in Ukraine began in February 2022, when Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine. The conflict has resulted in significant human suffering, displacement of people, and widespread destruction of infrastructure. Despite significant territorial gains by Russian forces in the initial stages of the war, Ukrainian forces have been able to regain control of some areas and have been pushing back against Russian advances in recent months.\n\n### Russian Defenses\n\nRussian forces have established a significant presence in eastern and southern Ukraine, with a focus on maintaining control of key cities and infrastructure. Russian defenses in the region are characterized by a network of trenches, bunkers, and fortifications, which have been reinforced with minefields and other obstacles. Russian forces have also been using artillery and aerial bombardments to target Ukrainian positions and infrastructure.\n\n**Prelude**\n\n### Planning\n\nThe Ukrainian counteroffensive was planned and coordinated by the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, in consultation with other government agencies and international partners. The operation was designed to take advantage of changes in the weather, which would make it more difficult for Russian forces to maintain their defensive positions. Ukrainian forces also conducted extensive reconnaissance and intelligence gathering operations to identify vulnerabilities in Russian defenses.\n\n### Shaping Operations\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the launch of the counteroffensive, Ukrainian forces conducted shaping operations to weaken Russian defenses and prepare the battlefield for the main attack. These operations included artillery and rocket strikes, as well as sabotage and reconnaissance activities against Russian supply lines and rear areas.\n\n**Counteroffensive**\n\n### Start Date\n\nThe Ukrainian counteroffensive began on May 9, 2023, with a series of coordinated attacks against Russian forces in eastern and southern Ukraine. The main attack was launched in the Melitopol direction, with Ukrainian forces pushing forward towards the city of Zaporizhzhia.\n\n### Southern Front\n\n#### Melitopol Direction\n\nThe Melitopol direction was one of the primary axes of the Ukrainian counteroffensive. Ukrainian forces launched a series of attacks against Russian positions in the Molochny region, with the goal of breaking through the Russian defensive line and advancing towards Zaporizhzhia. The fighting in this sector was intense, with both sides suffering significant losses.\n\n#### Berdiansk Direction: Staromaiorske-Urozhaine\n\nIn the Berdiansk direction, Ukrainian forces launched an attack against Russian positions in the Staromaiorske-Urozhaine region. The attack was successful, with Ukrainian forces breaking through the Russian defensive line and advancing towards the city of Berdiansk.\n\n### Eastern Front\n\n#### Donetsk Oblast\n\nThe Ukrainian counteroffensive also made significant gains in the Donetsk Oblast, with Ukrainian forces pushing forward against Russian positions in the cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk. The fighting in this sector was intense, with both sides suffering significant losses.\n\n### Dnieper Front\n\nIn the Dnieper Front, Ukrainian forces launched an attack against Russian positions in the Kherson region. The attack was successful, with Ukrainian forces breaking through the Russian defensive line and advancing towards the city of Kherson.\n\n### Behind Front Lines\n\n#### Crimea and the Black Sea\n\nBehind the front lines, Ukrainian forces are working to disrupt Russian supply lines and communication networks in the Crimean Peninsula and the Black Sea. This is being achieved through a combination of naval and aerial operations, as well as sabotage and reconnaissance activities.\n\n#### Other Areas\n\nIn other areas, Ukrainian forces are working to disrupt Russian supply lines and communication networks, as well as to gather intelligence on Russian military operations.\n\n**Result**\n\nThe Ukrainian counteroffensive has achieved significant results, with Ukrainian forces making significant gains against Russian forces in eastern and southern Ukraine. The operation has been characterized by intense fighting, with both sides suffering significant losses. However, the long-term outcome of the operation remains uncertain, and the conflict is likely to continue for some time.\n\n**Strengths**\n\n### Personnel\n\nUkrainian forces have demonstrated significant strength and resilience in the face of Russian aggression, with soldiers and civilians alike showing a willingness to fight and sacrifice for their country. The Ukrainian military has also demonstrated significant capabilities in terms of logistics and supply chain management, with the ability to move and supply large numbers of troops and equipment.\n\n### Equipment\n\nUkrainian forces have received significant quantities of military equipment and supplies from international partners, including the United States, European countries, and other allies. This equipment has played a significant role in the Ukrainian counteroffensive, with Ukrainian forces using it to launch attacks against Russian positions and to defend against Russian counterattacks.\n\n**Casualties and Losses**\n\n### Ukraine\n\nThe Ukrainian counteroffensive has resulted in significant casualties and losses for Ukrainian forces, with estimates suggesting that thousands of soldiers have been killed or wounded. However, the exact number of casualties is difficult to determine due to the chaos and destruction caused by the conflict.\n\n### Russia\n\nThe Ukrainian counteroffensive has also resulted in significant casualties and losses for Russian forces, with estimates suggesting that thousands of soldiers have been killed or wounded. However, the exact number of casualties is difficult to determine due to the secrecy surrounding Russian military operations.\n\n**Analysis**\n\n### Timeframe and Progression\n\nThe Ukrainian counteroffensive is a complex and dynamic operation, with the timeframe and progression of the operation difficult to predict. However, it is likely that the operation will continue for some time, with both sides experiencing significant challenges and setbacks.\n\n### Significance and Goals\n\nThe Ukrainian counteroffensive is significant because it represents a major shift in the balance of power in the conflict, with Ukrainian forces launching a major attack against Russian positions. The goals of the operation are unclear, but it is likely that Ukrainian forces are seeking to regain control of key areas and to weaken Russian forces.\n\n### Concerns\n\nThere are significant concerns surrounding the Ukrainian counteroffensive, including the potential for civilian casualties and the impact on the humanitarian situation in the region. Additionally, there are concerns about the long-term outcome of the operation and the potential for the conflict to escalate.\n\n**Tactics and Equipment**\n\n### Russian Minefields and Fortifications\n\nRussian forces have established a significant presence in eastern and southern Ukraine, with a focus on maintaining control of key cities and infrastructure. Russian defenses in the region are characterized by a network of trenches, bunkers, and fortifications, which have been reinforced with minefields and other obstacles.\n\n### Artillery and Aerial Warfare\n\nRussian forces have been using artillery and aerial bombardments to target Ukrainian positions and infrastructure. This has resulted in significant civilian casualties and damage to infrastructure.\n\n### Other Tactics and Equipment\n\nIn addition to artillery and aerial warfare, Russian forces have been using other tactics and equipment, including sabotage and reconnaissance activities. These activities have been used to disrupt Ukrainian supply lines and communication networks.\n\n**Russian Command**\n\n### Structure\n\nThe Russian command structure in eastern and southern Ukraine is complex and dynamic, with multiple levels of command and control. The Russian military has a significant presence in the region, with multiple units and formations operating in the area.\n\n### Issues\n\nThere are significant issues surrounding the Russian command structure in eastern and southern Ukraine, including the potential for command and control problems and the impact of the conflict on the Russian military.\n\n**Early Reactions**\n\n### Governmental\n\nThe Ukrainian government has welcomed the progress made by Ukrainian forces in the counteroffensive, with President Zelenskyy praising the bravery and resilience of Ukrainian soldiers. The government has also emphasized the need for continued international support and assistance.\n\n### Russian Information Space and Milbloggers\n\nThe Russian information space and milbloggers have been critical of the Ukrainian counteroffensive, with many accusing Ukrainian forces of using indiscriminate and inhumane tactics. However, the Russian military has also acknowledged the challenges posed by the counteroffensive and has emphasized the need for continued vigilance and defense.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Russian invasion of Ukraine\n* Ukrainian military\n* International response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine\n* Humanitarian situation in Ukraine\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is based on publicly available information and may not reflect the views of the Ukrainian government or other stakeholders.\n* The article is intended to provide a factual and informative overview of the 2023 Ukrainian counteroffensive, rather than to promote any particular agenda or perspective.\n\n**References**\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n**Bibliography**\n\n* \n* \n* \n*", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The elections also saw a significant increase in voter turnout, particularly among younger voters.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe 2022 elections were the first major tests of voter sentiment since the 2020 presidential election, which saw a significant shift towards Democratic candidates. The elections were also influenced by a range of issues, including the COVID-19 pandemic, economic concerns, and social justice movements.\n\n**Campaign**\n\nThe 2022 campaign season was marked by a number of notable trends and developments. Key issues that dominated the campaign included the economy, abortion, crime and gun violence, democracy, education, climate change, immigration, student loan forgiveness, and the presidency of Joe Biden.\n\n### **Primaries**\n\nThe primary season began in early 2022, with a number of notable candidates emerging in both parties. In the Republican Party, former President Donald Trump and other Trump-endorsed candidates performed well, while in the Democratic Party, moderate candidates such as Senator Joe Manchin and Representative Josh Gottheimer won key primaries.\n\n### **Issues**\n\nA number of key issues dominated the campaign, including:\n\n#### **Economy**\n\nThe economy was a major issue in the 2022 campaign, with many voters concerned about inflation, job security, and economic inequality.

The company has undergone several transformations and mergers, shaping its current form and market presence. This article provides an overview of Edwards Vacuum's history, products, and notable events, as well as its current status and market position.\n\nHistory\n\n### Independent (1919-1967)\n\nThe company was founded in 1919 by Albert Edwards in a small workshop in Crawley, West Sussex, England. Initially, the company focused on producing oil-sealed rotary vane vacuum pumps, which quickly gained popularity due to their reliability and ease of use. During the 1920s and 1930s, Edwards Vacuum expanded its product line to include other types of vacuum pumps, such as diffusion pumps and sputter ion pumps. The company's early success was largely driven by its innovative products and commitment to quality.\n\n### BOC (1968-2006)\n\nIn 1968, Edwards Vacuum was acquired by the British Oxygen Company (BOC), a leading industrial gases and equipment supplier. Under BOC's ownership, Edwards Vacuum continued to innovate and expand its product line. The company introduced new products, such as high-vacuum pumps and cryogenic pumps, and further developed its existing product range. Edwards Vacuum also established a strong presence in the global market, with operations in Europe, North America, and Asia.\n\n### Linde and CCMP Capital (2006-2014)\n\nIn 2006, BOC was acquired by Linde AG, a German industrial gases company.

His reign is significant for its relatively short duration and the limited number of sources available to historians.\n\n### Family\n\n#### Parents and Siblings\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's parentage is not well-documented, and researchers have proposed various theories about his ancestry. Some believe he was a descendant of the 6th dynasty pharaohs, while others suggest a connection to the 8th dynasty rulers.\n\n#### Consorts and Children\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's family life is also shrouded in mystery. There are no records of his consorts or children, making it difficult to determine the extent of his dynasty's influence.\n\n### Reign\n\n#### Attestations\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's reign is primarily known through a few sources:\n\n*   The Turin Papyrus, which lists the pharaohs of the 7th dynasty, including Merenre Nemtyemsaf I.\n*   The Saqqara Tablet, which provides a brief account of his reign and mentions his cultic activities.\n*   A few scarabs and seals that bear his name and titles.\n\n#### Chronology\n\n##### Relative\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's reign is believed to have occurred during the 22nd century BCE. However, the exact dates are uncertain due to the lack of reliable sources.\n\n##### Absolute\n\nSome researchers have proposed a relative chronology for the 7th dynasty, placing Merenre Nemtyemsaf I's reign between that of his predecessors, Neferkara I and Neferkare II.\n\n#### Duration\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's reign is estimated to have lasted around 1-2 years, although some sources suggest it may have been shorter.\n\n#### Accession to the throne: co-regency\n\nThere is no evidence to suggest that Merenre Nemtyemsaf I co-ruled with another pharaoh, although the possibility cannot be ruled out entirely.\n\n#### Domestic activities\n\n##### Administration\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's administration is largely unknown, and it is unclear whether he maintained the same level of centralized control as his predecessors.\n\n##### Cultic activities\n\nThe Saqqara Tablet mentions Merenre Nemtyemsaf I's involvement in cultic activities, including the worship of the goddess Hathor. This suggests that he may have maintained a strong connection to the traditional Egyptian pantheon.\n\n##### Construction works\n\nThere are no records of significant construction projects undertaken by Merenre Nemtyemsaf I during his reign.\n\n#### End of reign\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's reign likely ended with his death, although the exact circumstances are unclear. His successor, Neferkare II, may have taken power immediately after his death, or there may have been a brief period of interregnum.\n\n### Foreign activities\n\n#### Eastern Desert and Levant\n\nThere is no evidence to suggest that Merenre Nemtyemsaf I engaged in significant foreign activities, such as trade or military campaigns, during his reign.\n\n#### Nubia\n\nThe Nubian region, located south of Egypt, was likely not a major focus of Merenre Nemtyemsaf I's foreign policy during his reign.\n\n### Pyramid complex\n\n#### Main pyramid\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's pyramid, located at Saqqara, is not well-documented and is believed to be relatively small compared to other pyramids of the same period.\n\n#### Mortuary temple\n\nThe mortuary temple associated with Merenre Nemtyemsaf I's pyramid is also unknown, although it may have been a relatively simple structure.\n\n#### Mummy\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's mummy has not been discovered, and it is unclear whether he was buried in his pyramid or in another location.\n\n### Legacy\n\n#### Old Kingdom\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's legacy is largely overshadowed by the more prominent pharaohs of the Old Kingdom, such as Khufu and Sneferu.\n\n#### Later periods\n\nDuring later periods, such as the New Kingdom, Merenre Nemtyemsaf I's name was likely forgotten, and his reign was not well-documented.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The film was the 16th animated feature film produced by Disney, and it was released on January 29, 1959. The film follows the story of Princess Aurora, who is placed under a sleeping curse by the evil fairy Maleficent, and the efforts of Prince Philip and the good fairies to break the curse and save the princess.\n\n# Plot\n\nThe film begins with the presentation of the three good fairies, Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather, who attend the christening of Princess Aurora. The evil fairy Maleficent appears and curses the princess to prick her finger on a spinning wheel and fall into a deep sleep on her 16th birthday. The good fairies attempt to counter the curse but are unable to undo it entirely. On Aurora's 16th birthday, she pricks her finger on a spinning wheel and falls into a deep sleep. Prince Philip, who has fallen in love with Aurora, sets out to rescue her and battle Maleficent's minions.\n\nAs Prince Philip navigates the forest, he encounters various obstacles and creatures, including the three good fairies, who provide him with guidance and assistance. The prince eventually reaches Maleficent's castle, where he engages in a fierce battle with the evil fairy's minions. With the help of the good fairies, Prince Philip is able to defeat Maleficent and awaken Aurora from her sleep.\n\n# Voice Cast\n\n* Mary Costa as Princess Aurora\n* Bill Shirley as Prince Philip\n* Eleanor Audley as Maleficent\n* Verna Felton as Flora\n* Barbara Luderowski as Fauna\n* Barbara Jo Allen as Merryweather\n* Taylor Holmes as King Stefan\n* Eleanor Hibbard as Queen Leah\n\n# Production\n\n## Story Development\n\nThe story development for Sleeping Beauty began in the early 1950s, when Walt Disney Productions began working on the film's script and storyboards.

The team used a combination of traditional animation techniques and new technologies, such as the Xerox process, to create the film's animation.\n\n## Music\n\nThe music for Sleeping Beauty was composed by George Bruns, with additional music by Frank Churchill. The film's soundtrack included a range of musical styles, from classical to jazz, and featured a number of memorable songs and themes.

The film was a commercial success, grossing over $870,000 in its opening week and eventually becoming one of the highest-grossing films of 1959.\n\n## Re-Releases\n\nSleeping Beauty has been re-released a number of times since its initial release, including in 1967, 1976, and 1987. The film has also been released on home video and has been broadcast on television numerous times.\n\n## Home Media\n\nSleeping Beauty was first released on home video in 1986, as a laserdisc. The film was later released on VHS in 1988 and on DVD in 2003. The film's home video releases have been met with mixed reviews, with some critics praising the film's high-quality video and audio, while others have criticized the film's pacing and editing.\n\n### Lawsuit\n\nIn 2002, Walt Disney Home Entertainment sued a number of companies, including Amazon and eBay, over the sale of unauthorized copies of Sleeping Beauty on DVD. The lawsuit was eventually settled out of court, with the companies agreeing to remove the unauthorized copies from sale.\n\n# Reception\n\n## Critical Response\n\nSleeping Beauty received generally positive reviews from critics, with many praising the film's animation, music, and storyline. The film holds a 97% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with many critics praising the film's nostalgic value and its enduring popularity.\n\n## Accolades\n\nSleeping Beauty was nominated for two Academy Awards, including Best Original Score and Best Original Song for the song \"Once Upon a Dream.\" The film was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score.\n\n# Legacy\n\nSleeping Beauty has had a lasting impact on popular culture, with references to the film appearing in numerous other films, television shows, and works of art.

The incident has become one of the most enduring and intriguing UFO cases of all time, with numerous conspiracy theories and explanations emerging over the years.\n\n1947 Military Balloon Crash\n-------------------------\n\nOn July 8, 1947, a strange object crashed on a ranch near Roswell, New Mexico. The crash was initially reported by the local sheriff, George Wilcox, who claimed that he had found the wreckage of a \"flying disc.\" However, the US military quickly moved in to investigate and took control of the scene.\n\nThe US Army Air Forces (USAAF) issued a press release stating that they had recovered a \"flying disc\" from the crash site, which sparked widespread media attention and public interest. However, just one day later, the military issued a second press release stating that the crash was actually a high-altitude balloon that had been detected by the US military.\n\nUFO Conspiracy Theories (1947-1978)\n-----------------------------------\n\nDespite the military's explanation, many people believed that the US government was covering up the truth about the crash. Over the years, a number of conspiracy theories emerged, including:\n\n### Aztec Crashed Saucer Hoax\n\nIn the early 1950s, a man named Silas M. Newton claimed that he had found a crashed saucer in the desert near Albuquerque, New Mexico. Newton's story was later revealed to be a hoax, and his claims were debunked.\n\n### Hangar 18\n\nHangar 18 is a supposedly secret hangar at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio where the US government allegedly stores evidence of extraterrestrial life and technology. Many conspiracy theorists believe that the Roswell crash was taken to Hangar 18, where it was studied and reverse-engineered.\n\nRoswell Conspiracy Theories (1978-1994)\n--------------------------------------\n\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, a number of new conspiracy theories emerged about the Roswell incident. These included:\n\n### The Roswell Incident\n\nIn 1978, a man named Charles Berlitz published a book called \"The Roswell Incident,\" which claimed that the US government had recovered a crashed UFO from the Roswell crash site.

This approach emphasizes the importance of explicitly defining mathematical objects and operations, rather than relying on abstract axioms or non-constructive proofs. Constructive set theory has its roots in the ideas of L.E.J. Brouwer and has been developed further by mathematicians such as Errett Bishop and Vladimir Voevodsky.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nTraditional set theory, as developed by Georg Cantor and Ernst Zermelo, relies heavily on non-constructive principles such as the axiom of choice and the law of excluded middle. These principles allow for the existence of sets with arbitrary properties, but they can also lead to inconsistencies and paradoxes. In contrast, constructive set theory seeks to provide a more rigorous and explicit foundation for mathematics, by focusing on the constructive aspects of set theory.\n\n**Constructive Outlook**\n\n### Preliminary on the use of Intuitionistic Logic\n\nIntuitionistic logic is a formal system that differs from classical logic in several key ways. In intuitionistic logic, the law of excluded middle is not assumed to be true, and instead, the truth of a statement is determined by its constructive proof. This means that a statement is considered true only if there exists a constructive proof of its truth, rather than simply assuming it to be true by default.\n\n### Imposed Restrictions on a Set Theory\n\nConstructive set theory imposes several restrictions on the set theory, in order to ensure that it is constructive. For example, the axiom of choice is not assumed to be true, and instead, the existence of a choice function is proven constructively. Additionally, the law of excluded middle is not assumed to be true, and instead, the truth of a statement is determined by its constructive proof.\n\n### Metalogic\n\nMetalogic is the study of the logical properties of formal systems, including constructive set theory. In constructive set theory, metalogic is used to study the constructive aspects of the theory, such as the existence of constructive proofs and the properties of constructive sets.\n\n### Anti-Classical Principles\n\nAnti-classical principles are principles that are not accepted in constructive set theory. For example, the law of excluded middle is an anti-classical principle, as it is not assumed to be true in constructive set theory. Other anti-classical principles include the axiom of choice and the law of the excluded middle.\n\n**History and Overview**\n\n### Models\n\nModels of constructive set theory are formal systems that satisfy the axioms of constructive set theory.

The protests began in February 2023 and gained national attention, leading to widespread criticism and condemnation of the Indian government's handling of the situation.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Indian wrestling community has a long history of producing world-class wrestlers, with several Indian wrestlers winning Olympic medals and international tournaments. However, in recent years, the community has been plagued by allegations of corruption, nepotism, and favoritism. Many wrestlers have claimed that they have been subjected to harassment, intimidation, and physical violence by officials and coaches.\n\n**Initial Investigation**\n\nIn January 2023, several Indian wrestlers, including Olympic medalists Vinesh Phogat and Bajrang Punia, came forward with allegations of police brutality and corruption within the Indian wrestling community. The wrestlers claimed that they had been subjected to harassment and intimidation by officials and coaches, and that they had been denied access to fair trials and justice.\n\nThe Indian government responded to the allegations by launching an investigation into the matter. The investigation was led by the Delhi Police, which is responsible for maintaining law and order in the national capital. However, the investigation was widely criticized for being inadequate and biased, with many accusing the police of trying to cover up the allegations.\n\n**Protest Overview**\n\nThe protests began on February 19, 2023, when a group of Indian wrestlers, including Vinesh Phogat and Bajrang Punia, gathered at the Jantar Mantar in New Delhi to demand justice and accountability from the Indian government. The protesters, who were mostly wrestlers and their supporters, held placards and banners and shouted slogans demanding the resignation of the Indian government and the establishment of an independent inquiry into the allegations.\n\nThe protests quickly gained momentum, with more and more wrestlers and supporters joining in. The protesters marched through the streets of New Delhi, holding rallies and demonstrations in various parts of the city.\n\n**FIR Registration and Supreme Court Intervention**\n\nOn February 20, 2023, the Delhi Police registered an FIR (First Information Report) against several Indian wrestlers, including Vinesh Phogat and Bajrang Punia, on charges of rioting and obstructing public servants from performing their duty. The FIR was widely criticized as being biased and arbitrary, with many accusing the police of trying to silence the wrestlers.\n\nThe Indian Supreme Court intervened in the matter on February 22, 2023, staying the FIR registration and directing the police to investigate the allegations of corruption and police brutality. The court also directed the government to establish an independent inquiry into the allegations.\n\n**Jantar Mantar Clash**\n\nOn February 23, 2023, a clash broke out between the protesters and the police at the Jantar Mantar in New Delhi. The protesters, who were demanding justice and accountability, were met with baton charges and tear gas by the police. Several protesters were injured in the clash, and many were arrested.\n\n**Formation of SIT and Questioning of Witnesses**\n\nIn response to the Supreme Court's order, the Indian government formed a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to investigate the allegations of corruption and police brutality. The SIT, which was headed by a senior police officer, began questioning witnesses and gathering evidence.\n\nHowever, the SIT's investigation was widely criticized for being slow and inadequate, with many accusing the government of trying to cover up the allegations.\n\n**New Parliament House March and Detainment**\n\nOn February 25, 2023, the protesters marched to the New Parliament House in New Delhi, demanding justice and accountability from the Indian government. However, the police detained several protesters, including Vinesh Phogat and Bajrang Punia, on charges of rioting and obstructing public servants.\n\n**Meeting with Sports Minister and Filing of Chargesheet**\n\nOn February 27, 2023, the protesters met with the Indian Sports Minister, Anurag Thakur, to demand justice and accountability. However, the meeting was widely criticized for being inadequate and unsatisfactory.\n\nOn February 28, 2023, the SIT filed a chargesheet against several Indian wrestlers, including Vinesh Phogat and Bajrang Punia, on charges of rioting and obstructing public servants. The chargesheet was widely criticized for being biased and arbitrary.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe protests continued for several weeks, with the wrestlers and their supporters demanding justice and accountability from the Indian government. However, the government's response to the allegations was widely criticized for being inadequate and biased.\n\nIn the aftermath of the protests, several Indian wrestlers, including Vinesh Phogat and Bajrang Punia, were denied entry to the Indian wrestling team for the Commonwealth Games. The decision was widely criticized as being politically motivated.\n\n**Reactions**\n\n**Domestic**\n\nThe protests were widely criticized by domestic politicians and commentators, who accused the wrestlers of being irresponsible and attention-seeking. However, many also criticized the government's response to the allegations as being inadequate and biased.\n\n**Criticism**\n\nThe protests were also criticized for being a distraction from more important issues facing the country. However, many argued that the allegations of corruption and police brutality were serious and warranted attention.\n\n**International**\n\nThe protests were widely reported in international media, with many countries expressing concern over the allegations of corruption and police brutality.\n\n**United World Wrestling**\n\nThe United World Wrestling (UWW), the international governing body of wrestling, expressed concern over the allegations of corruption and police brutality. The UWW called for an independent inquiry into the allegations and urged the Indian government to take action to address the situation.\n\n**International Olympic Committee**\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) also expressed concern over the allegations of corruption and police brutality. The IOC called for an independent inquiry into the allegations and urged the Indian government to take action to address the situation.\n\n**Parliamentarians**\n\nSeveral parliamentarians from around the world expressed concern over the allegations of corruption and police brutality. They called for an independent inquiry into the allegations and urged the Indian government to take action to address the situation.\n\n**Media Coverage**\n\nThe protests were widely covered in the media, with many news outlets reporting on the allegations of corruption and police brutality. However, some media outlets were criticized for being biased and sensationalistic in their reporting.\n\n**Impact**\n\nThe protests had a significant impact on the Indian wrestling community, with many wrestlers and their supporters demanding justice and accountability from the Indian government. However, the government's response to the allegations was widely criticized for being inadequate and biased.\n\nThe protests also had a significant impact on the Indian sports community, with many athletes and coaches expressing concern over the allegations of corruption and police brutality.\n\n**Gallery**\n\n* A photo of Indian wrestlers Vinesh Phogat and Bajrang Punia protesting at the Jantar Mantar in New Delhi\n* A photo of the protesters marching through the streets of New Delhi\n* A photo of the police detaining protesters at the New Parliament House in New Delhi\n* A photo of the SIT questioning witnesses in the case\n\n**See also**\n\n* Indian wrestling\n* Corruption in India\n* Police brutality in India\n* Sports in India\n\n**References**\n\n* \n* \n*", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

These seizures are most commonly caused by a rapid increase in body temperature, often due to a viral or bacterial infection.\n\nSigns and symptoms\n------------------\n\n### Types\n\nFebrile seizures can take several forms, including:\n\n*   **Generalized tonic-clonic seizures**: These are the most common type of febrile seizure and are characterized by a loss of consciousness, muscle stiffness, and convulsions.\n*   **Focal seizures**: These seizures are limited to a specific area of the brain and can cause a range of symptoms, including numbness, tingling, and weakness.\n*   **Myoclonic seizures**: These seizures cause sudden, brief muscle contractions that can be accompanied by a loss of consciousness.\n\nCauses\n-------\n\nFebrile seizures are most commonly caused by a rapid increase in body temperature, often due to a viral or bacterial infection. Some common causes of febrile seizures include:\n\n*   **Viral infections**: Such as influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and rotavirus.\n*   **Bacterial infections**: Such as ear infections, urinary tract infections, and pneumonia.\n*   **Other causes**: Such as immunizations, allergic reactions, and certain medications.\n\nMechanism\n----------\n\nThe exact mechanism of febrile seizures is not fully understood, but it is thought to involve a combination of factors, including:\n\n*   **Increased body temperature**: A rapid increase in body temperature can cause changes in the brain's chemistry and function, leading to a seizure.\n*   **Release of neurotransmitters**: The release of neurotransmitters, such as dopamine and serotonin, can contribute to the development of a seizure.\n*   **Abnormal brain activity**: Abnormal brain activity, such as changes in brain wave patterns, can contribute to the development of a seizure.\n\nDiagnosis\n----------\n\nDiagnosing a febrile seizure can be challenging, as the symptoms can be similar to those of other conditions. However, a diagnosis can be made based on a combination of the following factors:\n\n*   **Medical history**: A thorough medical history, including information about the child's previous medical conditions and allergies.\n*   **Physical examination**: A physical examination, including a check for fever, muscle stiffness, and other symptoms.\n*   **Diagnostic tests**: Diagnostic tests, such as blood tests and imaging studies, may be ordered to rule out other conditions.\n\nPrevention\n----------\n\nWhile it is not possible to completely prevent febrile seizures, there are some steps that can be taken to reduce the risk:\n\n*   **Maintaining a safe environment**: Ensuring that the child's environment is safe and free from hazards can help to prevent injuries during a seizure.\n*   **Providing proper medical care**: Providing proper medical care, including medication and other treatments, can help to reduce the risk of febrile seizures.\n*   **Staying informed**: Staying informed about the child's medical condition and the latest research on febrile seizures can help to provide the best possible care.\n\nTreatment\n----------\n\nTreatment for febrile seizures typically involves a combination of the following:\n\n*   **Medications**: Medications, such as anticonvulsants and anti-inflammatory agents, may be prescribed to help control the seizure and reduce the risk of future seizures.\n*   **Fluid replacement**: Fluid replacement, such as IV fluids, may be necessary to help replace lost fluids and electrolytes.\n*   **Monitoring**: Monitoring the child's vital signs and neurological status can help to ensure that the seizure is controlled and that the child is safe.\n\nPrognosis\n----------\n\nThe prognosis for children with febrile seizures is generally good, with most children making a full recovery and having no long-term effects. However, some children may experience:\n\n*   **Seizure recurrence**: Some children may experience recurrent febrile seizures, which can increase the risk of developing epilepsy.\n*   **Developmental delays**: Some children may experience developmental delays or other cognitive impairments due to the seizure.\n*   **Emotional and behavioral problems**: Some children may experience emotional and behavioral problems, such as anxiety and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, due to the seizure.\n\nEpidemiology\n------------\n\nFebrile seizures are a common condition, affecting approximately 2-5% of children between the ages of six months and five years. The risk of febrile seizures is higher in children with:\n\n*   **Family history**: Children with a family history of febrile seizures are at increased risk.\n*   **Previous medical conditions**: Children with previous medical conditions, such as ear infections and urinary tract infections, are at increased risk.\n*   **Age**: Children between the ages of six months and five years are at increased risk.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nThis article has been written to provide factual and informative content about febrile seizures.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

His philosophical system, which emphasizes the unity and absolute spirit, has had a profound impact on modern thought, influencing fields such as philosophy, theology, politics, and art.\n\n**Life**\n\n### Formative years\n\n**Stuttgart, Tübingen, Berne, Frankfurt (1770–1800)**\n\nHegel was born in Stuttgart, Württemberg, Germany, to a family of civil servants. His father was a revenue officer, and the family moved to Württemberg when Hegel was a child. Hegel's early education took place in Stuttgart, where he excelled in languages, literature, and philosophy. In 1788, he enrolled in the University of Tübingen to study theology and philosophy. During his time at Tübingen, Hegel developed a strong interest in philosophy, particularly in the works of Immanuel Kant and Johann Gottlieb Fichte. In 1790, he moved to Berne, Switzerland, where he studied law and philosophy, and in 1793, he returned to Frankfurt, where he worked as a tutor and began to develop his own philosophical ideas.\n\n### Career years\n\n**Jena, Bamberg, Nuremberg (1801–1816)**\n\nIn 1801, Hegel moved to Jena, where he became a lecturer in philosophy at the University of Jena. During his time in Jena, Hegel developed his philosophical system, which emphasized the unity and absolute spirit. In 1807, he published his first major work, _The Phenomenology of Spirit_. In 1808, he moved to Bamberg, where he worked as a vice-rector of the Gymnasium, and in 1811, he returned to Nuremberg, where he worked as a editor and lecturer. In 1816, he moved to Heidelberg, where he became a professor of philosophy at the University of Heidelberg.\n\n### Heidelberg, Berlin (1816–1831)\n\nIn 1816, Hegel moved to Heidelberg, where he became a professor of philosophy at the University of Heidelberg.

The referendums were held between September 23 and 27, 2022, and were aimed at incorporating the occupied territories into Russia.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe referendums were held in the context of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, which began on February 24, 2022. The invasion led to a significant escalation of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which had been ongoing since 2014. The referendums were seen as a means for Russia to annex the occupied territories and legitimize its control over them.\n\n**Organization**\n\nThe referendums were organized by the Russian authorities in the occupied territories, with the support of the Russian government. The referendums were held in four regions: Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts, Kherson Oblast, and Zaporizhzhia Oblast.\n\n**Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts**\n\nThe referendums in Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts were held on September 23-27, 2022.\n\n## Questions\n\nThe referendums in Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts asked voters to approve the annexation of the regions to Russia. The questions were:\n\n* \"Do you support the joining of the Donetsk People's Republic to the Russian Federation?\"\n* \"Do you support the joining of the Luhansk People's Republic to the Russian Federation?\"\n\n## Results\n\nThe results of the referendums in Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts were announced on September 27, 2022. According to the authorities, the referendums were overwhelmingly approved, with over 90% of voters supporting the annexation.\n\n**Kherson Oblast**\n\nThe referendum in Kherson Oblast was held on September 23-27, 2022.\n\n## Question\n\nThe question asked in the referendum in Kherson Oblast was:\n\n* \"Do you support the joining of the Kherson region to the Russian Federation?\"\n\n## Result\n\nThe result of the referendum in Kherson Oblast was announced on September 27, 2022. According to the authorities, the referendum was approved by over 87% of voters.\n\n**Zaporizhzhia Oblast**\n\nThe referendum in Zaporizhzhia Oblast was held on September 23-27, 2022.\n\n## Question\n\nThe question asked in the referendum in Zaporizhzhia Oblast was:\n\n* \"Do you support the joining of the Zaporizhzhia region to the Russian Federation?\"\n\n## Result\n\nThe result of the referendum in Zaporizhzhia Oblast was announced on September 27, 2022. According to the authorities, the referendum was approved by over 93% of voters.\n\n**Other planned locations**\n\nIn addition to the referendums held in Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts, Kherson Oblast, and Zaporizhzhia Oblast, referendums were also planned in Mykolaiv Oblast and Kharkiv Oblast.\n\n## Mykolaiv Oblast\n\nThe referendum in Mykolaiv Oblast was scheduled to be held on September 23-27, 2022, but was postponed due to the ongoing conflict in the region.\n\n## Kharkiv Oblast\n\nThe referendum in Kharkiv Oblast was scheduled to be held on September 23-27, 2022, but was also postponed due to the ongoing conflict in the region.\n\n**Opinion polls**\n\nPrior to the referendums, opinion polls were conducted in the occupied territories to gauge public opinion on the annexation. The polls showed that a significant majority of voters supported the annexation, with some polls indicating support rates of over 90%.\n\n**Opinions on the goals of holding referendums**\n\nThe Russian authorities claimed that the referendums were held to allow the people of the occupied territories to express their will and decide their future. However, critics argued that the referendums were a sham and were designed to legitimize Russia's control over the territories.\n\n**Conduct**\n\nThe referendums were conducted in a manner that was criticized by international observers. The voting process was marred by reports of irregularities, including allegations of vote-buying and intimidation of voters.\n\n## First day\n\nThe first day of the referendums, September 23, 2022, saw long lines of voters at polling stations in the occupied territories. However, reports emerged of irregularities, including allegations of vote-buying and intimidation of voters.\n\n## Second day\n\nThe second day of the referendums, September 24, 2022, saw continued reports of irregularities, including allegations of vote-buying and intimidation of voters.

He is often referred to as the \"Father of the Constitution\" for his instrumental role in drafting and promoting the document. Madison was a key figure in the early history of the United States, playing a leading role in the country's founding and its growth into a powerful nation.\n\n**Early life and education**\n\nMadison was born in Port Conway, Virginia, to Col. James Madison Sr. and Nelly Conway Madison. He was the eldest of twelve children and grew up on the family's plantation, Montpelier. Madison received his early education at a local school and later attended the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University), where he graduated in 1771. After college, Madison studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1776.\n\n**American Revolution and Articles of Confederation**\n\nDuring the American Revolution, Madison served as a delegate to the Virginia Convention in 1776 and later as a member of the Continental Congress from 1780 to 1783. He played a key role in drafting the Articles of Confederation, which served as the first constitution of the United States. However, Madison soon became disillusioned with the Articles, which he believed were inadequate for governing the young nation.\n\n**Ratification of the Constitution**\n\nIn 1787, Madison attended the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, where he played a leading role in drafting the United States Constitution. He worked closely with other Founding Fathers, including George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, and Alexander Hamilton, to create a document that would provide a strong federal government while protecting individual liberties. Madison was instrumental in promoting the Constitution through his influential essays, known as the Federalist Papers, which were published anonymously in 1788.\n\n**Congressman and party leader (1789–1801)**\n\n### Election to Congress\n\nMadison was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1789, where he served for three terms. He was a key leader in the Democratic-Republican Party, which opposed the Federalist Party led by Alexander Hamilton.\n\n### Bill of Rights\n\nIn 1789, Madison introduced a series of amendments to the Constitution, which became known as the Bill of Rights. The amendments, which were ratified in 1791, protected individual liberties such as freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right to a fair trial.\n\n### Founding the Democratic–Republican Party\n\nMadison was a key figure in the founding of the Democratic-Republican Party, which opposed the Federalist Party's strong central government and emphasis on industrial development. The Democratic-Republicans advocated for states' rights, limited government, and the interests of farmers and laborers.\n\n### Marriage and family\n\nMadison married Dolley Payne Todd in 1794, and the couple had no children together. However, Madison had a stepson, John Payne Todd, from Dolley's previous marriage.\n\n### Adams presidency\n\nDuring the presidency of John Adams, Madison served as Secretary of State. However, the two men had significant differences, and Madison's role was largely limited to diplomatic duties.\n\n**Secretary of State (1801–1809)**\n\n### 1808 presidential election\n\nIn 1808, Madison was elected as the fourth President of the United States, defeating Federalist candidate Charles Cotesworth Pinckney.\n\n**Presidency (1809–1817)**\n\n### Inauguration and cabinet\n\nMadison was inaugurated on March 4, 1809, and his cabinet included Secretary of State Robert Smith, Secretary of War Henry Dearborn, and Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin.\n\n### War of 1812\n\n#### Prelude to war\n\nThe British Navy's practice of impressing American sailors and seizing American ships led to growing tensions between the United States and Great Britain. Madison's administration issued a series of ultimatums, which were ignored by the British. On June 18, 1812, Madison signed a declaration of war against Great Britain.\n\n#### Military actions\n\nThe War of 1812 was a series of military actions, including battles at Lake Erie, Lake Champlain, and New Orleans. Although the war was fought on multiple fronts, the outcome was largely indecisive.\n\n### Postwar period and decline of the Federalist opposition\n\nThe War of 1812 marked the decline of the Federalist Party, which had opposed the war. The Democratic-Republicans, led by Madison, emerged as the dominant party in the United States.\n\n### Native American policy\n\nMadison's administration negotiated several treaties with Native American tribes, including the Treaty of Fort Jackson, which ceded large tracts of land to the United States.\n\n### Election of 1816\n\nMadison was re-elected in 1816, defeating Federalist candidate Rufus King.\n\n**Post-presidency (1817–1836)**\n\nMadison retired to his estate at Montpelier, where he died on June 28, 1836. He was 85 years old.\n\n**Political and religious views**\n\n### Federalism\n\nMadison was a strong advocate for federalism, believing that a strong central government was necessary for the United States to prosper. However, he also believed in limiting the power of the federal government and protecting individual liberties.\n\n### Religion\n\nMadison was a Episcopalian and believed in the importance of religion in American life. He attended church regularly and advocated for the separation of church and state.\n\n**Slavery**\n\nMadison owned slaves throughout his life, but he also advocated for gradual emancipation. In his later years, he opposed the expansion of slavery into new territories.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nJames Madison is remembered as one of the most influential figures in American history. He played a key role in the drafting and promotion of the United States Constitution and was a strong advocate for federalism, states' rights, and individual liberties. His presidency marked the beginning of a new era in American politics, as the Democratic-Republicans emerged as the dominant party in the United States.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The film features an ensemble cast, including Ranveer Singh, Pooja Hegde, Varun Sharma, Jacqueline Fernandez, and Siddhartha Jadhav, among others.\n\nPlot\n\nThe film revolves around a fictional circus troupe, Circus Bambino, which is on the verge of bankruptcy. The troupe's owner, Pratap Singh (played by Pankaj Tripathi), is struggling to keep the circus afloat due to financial difficulties. However, things take a turn when the troupe's star performer, Rajendra Pratap Singh (played by Ranveer Singh), returns to the circus after a long hiatus. Rajendra is a former trapeze artist who had left the circus after a tragic accident. He had been pursuing a successful career as a stuntman in Hollywood, but he returns to the circus to help his father and the troupe.\n\nRajendra's return sparks a series of events that lead to a high-stakes competition between the circus and a rival circus troupe, Circus Sajjan. The rival circus is owned by a wealthy and ruthless businessman, Sajjan Singh (played by Sanjay Mishra), who will stop at nothing to win the competition.\n\nAs the competition heats up, Rajendra and his teammates must use their skills and ingenuity to outdo the rival circus and save the day. Along the way, Rajendra must confront his past and face his fears in order to emerge victorious.\n\nCast\n\nRanveer Singh as Rajendra Pratap Singh\nPooja Hegde as Pallavi\nVarun Sharma as Lallan\nJacqueline Fernandez as Naina\nSiddhartha Jadhav as Gopi\nPankaj Tripathi as Pratap Singh\nSanjay Mishra as Sajjan Singh\n\nProduction\n\nDevelopment\n\nCirkus is the third film in Rohit Shetty's Bollywood Circus series, following the success of Golmaal 3 and Golmaal Again. The film was in development for over two years before it finally went into production.\n\nCasting\n\nThe casting process for Cirkus was a long and rigorous one. Rohit Shetty wanted to cast a talented and diverse ensemble cast, and he held auditions across the country to find the right actors for the roles. Ranveer Singh was the first choice for the role of Rajendra Pratap Singh, and he was eventually joined by Pooja Hegde, Varun Sharma, Jacqueline Fernandez, and Siddhartha Jadhav, among others.\n\nFilming\n\nThe filming of Cirkus took place over a period of six months in various locations across India, including Mumbai, Pune, and Ahmedabad. The film's cinematographer, DJ Bhattacharya, shot the film on a combination of 35mm film and digital cameras. The film's stunt team, led by Rohit Shetty's longtime collaborator, Sham Kaushal, performed many of the film's high-octane stunts.\n\nPost-production\n\nThe post-production of Cirkus was a lengthy and complex process. The film's editor, Shree Narayan Singh, worked tirelessly to ensure that the film's pacing and timing were perfect. The film's music composer, Pritam, created a catchy and energetic soundtrack that perfectly complemented the film's action-packed sequences.\n\nMusic\n\nThe music of Cirkus is a key component of the film's overall experience. The film's soundtrack features six original songs, including the hit single \"Chamma Chamma\", which became a chart-topper on the day of the film's release. The soundtrack also features a range of catchy and upbeat background tracks that perfectly complement the film's high-energy sequences.\n\nRelease\n\nTheatrical\n\nCirkus was released in theaters across India on December 23, 2021, coinciding with the Christmas holiday season. The film's release was accompanied by a high-profile promotional campaign, which included the launch of a range of merchandise and the release of a series of trailers and teasers.\n\nHome media\n\nCirkus was released on digital platforms on January 1, 2022, following a successful theatrical run. The film's digital release was accompanied by a range of bonus features, including behind-the-scenes footage and interviews with the cast and crew.\n\nReception\n\nCritical response\n\nCirkus received generally positive reviews from critics, with many praising the film's high-energy action sequences, catchy music, and talented ensemble cast. However, some critics felt that the film's plot was predictable and that the characters were underdeveloped.\n\nBox office\n\nCirkus was a commercial success at the box office, grossing over ₹300 crore worldwide. The film's success can be attributed to its high-energy action sequences, catchy music, and talented ensemble cast, which appealed to a wide range of audiences.\n\nSee also\n\nBollywood Circus series\nGolmaal 3\nGolmaal Again\nRohit Shetty\nRanveer Singh\nPooja Hegde\nVarun Sharma\nJacqueline Fernandez\nSiddhartha Jadhav\nPankaj Tripathi\nSanjay Mishra\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nCirkus on IMDb\nCirkus on Bollywood Hungama", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.
