These acts were a response to the growing concern about the potential for mutiny among military personnel, which was perceived as a threat to national security and stability.\n\nBackground\n----------\n\nThe concept of mutiny has been present throughout history, with instances recorded dating back to ancient times. However, the modern era of Mutiny Acts began in the 17th century, as the British military expanded its reach and influence around the world. The need for a legal framework to govern the behavior of military personnel became increasingly apparent, particularly as the British Navy grew in size and complexity.\n\nPassage of the first Mutiny Act\n-----------------------------\n\nThe first Mutiny Act was passed in 1689, during the reign of King William III. This act established the framework for regulating military behavior, with a focus on preventing mutiny and ensuring discipline among sailors and soldiers. The act made it an offense to incite or participate in mutiny, and established penalties for those found guilty.\n\nThe act also provided for the creation of commissions of inquiry to investigate allegations of mutiny, and for the courts-martial to try those accused of the offense. The 1689 Mutiny Act was a significant milestone in the development of military law, and set the stage for the subsequent renewal of the Mutiny Acts.\n\nRenewal of the Mutiny Acts\n-------------------------\n\nOver the centuries, the Mutiny Acts were renewed and revised numerous times, reflecting the changing needs and circumstances of the British military. In 1717, a new Mutiny Act was passed, which expanded the scope of the earlier act and increased the penalties for those found guilty of mutiny.\n\nIn 1757, a further revision of the Mutiny Act was introduced, which made it an offense to desert or absent oneself from duty without permission. This act also established the concept of \"desertion,\" which was defined as the unauthorized absence from duty.\n\nThe Quartering Acts\n-------------------\n\nThe Quartering Acts were a series of laws passed in the 18th century to regulate the quartering of soldiers in England and Ireland. The Quartering Acts were a response to the growing need for accommodations for soldiers, particularly during times of war or military occupation.\n\nThe first Quartering Act was passed in 1662, during the reign of King Charles II. This act authorized the quartering of soldiers in private homes, and established the concept of \"quartering\" as a means of providing accommodations for military personnel.\n\nIn 1691, a further revision of the Quartering Act was introduced, which made it an offense to refuse to quarter soldiers in one's home. This act also established the concept of \"quartering\" as a means of supporting the military, and providing accommodations for soldiers.\n\nList\n-----\n\n### England\n\n* 1689: First Mutiny Act

The kingdom was founded in 1350 by King Ramathibodi I, also known as King Uthong, and was named after the city of Ayutthaya, which served as its capital. During its existence, the Ayutthaya Kingdom played a significant role in the history of Southeast Asia, and its legacy continues to shape the culture and society of Thailand today.\n\n**History**\n\n### **Origins**\n\n#### **Pre-Ayutthaya cities**\n\nBefore the establishment of the Ayutthaya Kingdom, the region was inhabited by various cities and kingdoms, including the city of Sukhothai, which was an important center of trade and culture. However, the city of Ayutthaya was not one of these cities. Instead, it was founded by King Ramathibodi I, who is said to have been inspired by the vision of a great city.\n\n#### **The traditional founding of Ayutthaya**\n\nAccording to legend, King Ramathibodi I founded Ayutthaya in 1350, after a long period of wandering the region and searching for a suitable place to establish his kingdom. He is said to have been led by a holy man who guided him to the site of the modern city.\n\n### **Early maritime dominance**\n\nThe Ayutthaya Kingdom was founded at a time when trade and commerce were becoming increasingly important in Southeast Asia. The kingdom's early rulers recognized the importance of maritime trade and established a strong navy to protect their interests. The kingdom's early maritime dominance allowed it to establish trade relationships with other kingdoms in the region, including the Kingdom of Cambodia and the Sultanate of Malacca.\n\n### **Age of warfare**\n\nThe Ayutthaya Kingdom's early period was marked by a series of wars and conflicts with its neighbors. The kingdom's rulers were skilled warriors and used their military power to expand their territory and establish their dominance over the region. The kingdom's early period also saw the development of a complex system of governance, with a strong emphasis on the authority of the king.\n\n#### **Transition to a hinterland state**\n\nThe Ayutthaya Kingdom's early period of maritime dominance eventually gave way to a period of transition, during which the kingdom began to focus more on its interior and less on its maritime interests. This transition was marked by a shift in the kingdom's economy, with a greater emphasis on agriculture and trade within the region.\n\n#### **Centralization and dominance of the Northern lords**\n\nDuring this period, the kingdom's power began to be centralized in the hands of the Northern lords, who were powerful nobles who controlled large areas of the kingdom's northern territories. The Northern lords were skilled warriors and played a crucial role in the kingdom's military campaigns.\n\n#### **First Burmese wars**\n\nThe Ayutthaya Kingdom's early period also saw a series of conflicts with the Kingdom of Burma, which was a powerful and influential kingdom in the region. The kingdom's first Burmese war, which took place in the 16th century, was a significant conflict that marked the beginning of a long period of tension between the two kingdoms.\n\n### **Peace and commerce**\n\nThe Ayutthaya Kingdom's later period was marked by a period of peace and commerce, during which the kingdom's rulers established a number of important trade relationships with other kingdoms in the region. The kingdom's economy began to flourish, with a growing emphasis on trade and commerce.\n\n#### **Later Phitsanulok dynasty to early Prasat Thong dynasty**\n\nDuring this period, the kingdom was ruled by a number of powerful monarchs, including the Phitsanulok dynasty and the early Prasat Thong dynasty. The Phitsanulok dynasty was a powerful and influential dynasty that played a significant role in the kingdom's history.\n\n#### **Persian and French influences**\n\nThe Ayutthaya Kingdom's later period also saw the influence of Persian and French cultures, which had a significant impact on the kingdom's art, architecture, and literature.\n\n### **Late Ayutthaya period**\n\nThe Ayutthaya Kingdom's late period was marked by a number of significant events, including the introduction of capitalism and the rise of commoners as a powerful social class.\n\n#### **Continued prosperity and increased Chinese connections**\n\nDuring this period, the kingdom's economy continued to flourish, with a growing emphasis on trade and commerce. The kingdom's connections with China also increased, with a number of Chinese merchants and traders establishing themselves in the kingdom.\n\n#### **Succession conflicts and corruption**\n\nThe late Ayutthaya period was also marked by a number of succession conflicts and corruption scandals, which had a significant impact on the kingdom's stability and prosperity.\n\n#### **Introduction of capitalism, rise of commoners, and proto-nationalism**\n\nThe late Ayutthaya period saw the introduction of capitalism, which had a significant impact on the kingdom's economy and society. The rise of commoners as a powerful social class also marked this period, as did the emergence of proto-nationalist sentiment.\n\n#### **Nobility and Buddhism**\n\nThe Ayutthaya Kingdom's nobility played a significant role in the kingdom's history, with many nobles serving as advisors and administrators. The kingdom's rulers were also deeply committed to Buddhism, which played a significant role in the kingdom's culture and society.\n\n#### **Military and political situation to 1759**\n\nThe Ayutthaya Kingdom's military and political situation in the late 18th century was marked by a number of conflicts with its neighbors, including the Kingdom of Burma.

The kingdom's final ruler, King Ekkathat, was killed in the battle, and the kingdom was absorbed into the Kingdom of Siam.\n\n#### **Aftermath**\n\nThe fall of the Ayutthaya Kingdom marked the end of an era in Thai history, with a significant impact on the country's culture and society.

The film stars Chiranjeevi, Ram Charan, and Kajal Aggarwal in lead roles. Produced by N. V. Prasad and Ramabrahmam Sunkara under the banners of N. V. Prasad and A. K. Entertainments, the film was released on May 13, 2022.\n\nPlot\n\nThe film revolves around the life of Rudra Acharya (played by Chiranjeevi), a 65-year-old village priest who lives a simple life in a small village. However, his peaceful life is disrupted when he discovers that the village is being threatened by a local goon named Nandi (played by Sonu Sood). Nandi has been causing trouble in the village and is involved in various illicit activities. Rudra, who had once been a former police officer, decides to take matters into his own hands and rid the village of Nandi's influence.\n\nAs Rudra starts to confront Nandi, he is aided by his son, Suri (played by Ram Charan), who is a young and ambitious man. Suri is initially portrayed as a rogue and a ladies' man, but as the story progresses, he reveals his softer side. The two of them, along with a young woman named Sara (played by Kajal Aggarwal), work together to bring Nandi to justice.\n\nThroughout the film, there are several subplots that add to the overall storyline. One of the main subplots revolves around Rudra's relationship with his wife, Padma (played by Nayanthara). The couple's love story is told through flashbacks, and their chemistry is palpable. Another subplot involves Suri's friendship with a local girl named Shriya (played by Charithra Rakini).\n\nCast\n\n* Chiranjeevi as Rudra Acharya\n* Ram Charan as Suri\n* Kajal Aggarwal as Sara\n* Sonu Sood as Nandi\n* Nayanthara as Padma\n* Charithra Rakini as Shriya\n* Ajay as Gopal\n* Tanikella Bharani as Advocate\n* Prabhu as Deva\n\nProduction\n\n### Development\n\nAcharya was first announced in 2018, with Koratala Siva set to direct the film.

The film was put on hold for several years, and it was only in 2020 that the project was revived with Chiranjeevi on board.\n\n### Casting\n\nThe casting process for Acharya was a long and arduous one. Ram Charan was initially approached to play the role of Suri, but he turned down the offer due to his commitment to other projects. Kajal Aggarwal was cast as Sara, and Sonu Sood was brought on board to play the role of Nandi.\n\n### Filming\n\nFilming for Acharya began in October 2020 and lasted for several months. The film was primarily shot in the cities of Hyderabad and Tirupati. The action sequences were choreographed by Ram Prasad, and the cinematography was handled by Shekhar Vissapragada.\n\n### Legal issues\n\nThere were reports of a legal dispute between Chiranjeevi and Koratala Siva regarding the film's script. However, the issue was eventually resolved, and the film was completed without any major hiccups.\n\nMusic\n\nThe music for Acharya was composed by Mani Sharma, who has worked with Chiranjeevi on several films. The soundtrack features five songs, including the title track, which was released in April 2022. The song was well-received by the audience, and it quickly became a hit.\n\nRelease\n\n### Theatrical\n\nAcharya was released in theaters on May 13, 2022, in a limited capacity due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The film was screened in select theaters in Hyderabad and other major cities.\n\n### Home media\n\nThe film was released on Amazon Prime Video on June 10, 2022, where it received a mixed response from the audience.\n\nReception\n\n### Box office\n\nAcharya received a mixed response at the box office. The film performed moderately well in the Telugu states, but it failed to make a significant impact in other regions. According to reports, the film collected around ₹70 crore (US$9.3 million) worldwide.\n\n### Critical response\n\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics. Some praised the performances of the lead actors, while others felt that the story was predictable and lacked depth.

The conflict has its roots in Ukraine's struggle for independence and its efforts to establish a closer relationship with the European Union. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the background, history, human rights violations, and related issues surrounding the conflict.\n\n**Background**\n\n#### Independent Ukraine and the Orange Revolution\n\nIn 1991, Ukraine declared its independence from the Soviet Union, marking the beginning of a new era for the country. However, Ukraine's early years as an independent nation were marked by economic struggles and corruption. The Orange Revolution in 2004 brought about a significant change in Ukraine's politics, as millions of people took to the streets to demand a fair election and greater transparency. The revolution led to the ousting of President Leonid Kuchma and the election of Viktor Yushchenko, a pro-Western candidate.\n\n#### Euromaidan, Revolution of Dignity, and pro-Russian unrest\n\nIn 2013, Ukraine's then-President Viktor Yanukovych sparked widespread protests by announcing that he would not sign an association agreement with the European Union, instead choosing to pursue closer ties with Russia. The protests, known as Euromaidan, grew in size and intensity over the next several months, with demonstrators demanding greater freedoms and an end to corruption. In February 2014, Yanukovych was ousted, and a new government was formed. However, pro-Russian unrest continued in eastern Ukraine, with many residents expressing support for the deposed president.\n\n#### Russian military bases in Crimea\n\nIn 1997, Russia and Ukraine signed a lease agreement that allowed Russia to maintain its military bases in Crimea, a Ukrainian peninsula that has a significant Russian-speaking population. The agreement was set to expire in 2017, but Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 led to the extension of the lease.\n\n#### Legality and declaration of war\n\nThe legality of the Russian annexation of Crimea and the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine is disputed. While Russia claims that it was acting to protect its interests and the rights of Russian-speaking citizens in Ukraine, Ukraine and many other countries view the annexation as a violation of international law. Ukraine has declared the conflict a war, while Russia has characterized it as a \"counter-terrorist operation.\"\n\n**History**\n\n#### Russian annexation of Crimea (2014)\n\nIn March 2014, Russian troops moved into Crimea, leading to the annexation of the peninsula by Russia. The annexation was widely condemned by the international community, with many countries imposing sanctions on Russia. Ukraine and Russia have differing accounts of events leading up to the annexation, with Ukraine accusing Russia of orchestrating a separatist movement and Russia claiming that it was responding to a request for protection from local residents.\n\n#### War in the Donbas (2014–2015)\n\nIn April 2014, pro-Russian unrest turned violent in eastern Ukraine, with clashes between Ukrainian government forces and separatist groups. The conflict escalated in July 2014, with the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, which killed all 298 people on board. The incident led to international condemnation of Russia's involvement in the conflict.\n\n#### Pro-Russia unrest\n\nPro-Russian unrest continued in eastern Ukraine throughout 2014 and 2015, with separatist groups declaring independence from Ukraine and establishing their own governments. The unrest was marked by violence, with both Ukrainian government forces and separatist groups committing human rights abuses.\n\n#### Armed conflict\n\nThe conflict escalated in July 2014, with the outbreak of armed hostilities between Ukrainian government forces and separatist groups. The conflict was marked by numerous ceasefire agreements, but fighting continued, with both sides accusing the other of violating the agreements.\n\n#### August 2014 Russian invasion\n\nIn August 2014, Russia launched a military invasion of eastern Ukraine, with troops crossing into Ukrainian territory. The invasion was widely condemned by the international community, with many countries imposing sanctions on Russia.\n\n#### Mariupol offensive and first Minsk ceasefire\n\nIn January 2015, Ukrainian government forces launched an operation to retake the city of Mariupol, which had been occupied by separatist forces. The operation was successful, but fighting continued in other parts of eastern Ukraine. In February 2015, a ceasefire agreement was signed in Minsk, Belarus, but fighting continued, with both sides accusing the other of violating the agreement.\n\n#### End of 2014 and Minsk II agreement\n\nIn 2014, a series of agreements were signed in Minsk, Belarus, aimed at ending the conflict in eastern Ukraine. However, fighting continued, and a new agreement, known as Minsk II, was signed in 2015. The agreement established a ceasefire and provided for the withdrawal of heavy weapons from the front lines.\n\n#### Line of conflict stabilizes (2015–2022)\n\nFrom 2015 to 2022, the conflict in eastern Ukraine stabilized, with both sides adhering to the Minsk II agreement. However, tensions continued, with both sides accusing the other of violating the agreement.\n\n#### 2018 Kerch Strait incident\n\nIn November 2018, a Russian naval vessel fired on Ukrainian naval vessels in the Kerch Strait, which connects the Black Sea to the Sea of Azov. The incident led to international condemnation of Russia's actions.\n\n#### 2019–2020\n\nIn 2019 and 2020, the conflict in eastern Ukraine continued, with both sides adhering to the Minsk II agreement.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

{"title": "Fuzzball_(string_theory)", "content": "#Physical properties\n##String theory and composition\n##Densities\n##Neutron star collapse\n#Information paradox\n#Testability of the theory\n#References\n#External links\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Fuzzball (string theory)\n\nFuzzballs are theoretical objects in string theory, a framework for understanding the universe that proposes the existence of one-dimensional strings as the fundamental building blocks of matter and energy. In the context of string theory, fuzzballs are specific types of compactified objects that arise from the interactions of strings in a Calabi-Yau manifold.\n\n**Physical properties**\n\n#### String theory and composition\n\nIn string theory, the universe is composed of one-dimensional strings that vibrate at different frequencies. These vibrations give rise to the various particles we observe in the universe, such as electrons, photons, and quarks. Fuzzballs, on the other hand, are compactified objects that arise from the interactions of strings in a Calabi-Yau manifold. They are essentially \"fuzzy\" versions of black holes, where the information about the black hole is encoded on the surface of the event horizon, rather than being lost in the singularity at the center.\n\nFuzzballs are thought to be the fundamental units of matter and energy in the universe, and they are believed to be the simplest objects that can exist in string theory. They are described by a set of equations that encode the vibrations of the strings and the interactions between them. The properties of fuzzballs are determined by the Calabi-Yau manifold on which they are compactified, and they can be classified based on the type of Calabi-Yau manifold they arise from.\n\n#### Densities\n\nFuzzballs have a characteristic density that is determined by the vibrations of the strings and the compactification of the Calabi-Yau manifold. This density is typically much higher than that of a traditional black hole, and it is thought to be a key feature of fuzzballs. In fact, the density of a fuzzball is so high that it is often referred to as a \"fuzzball density.\"\n\nThe density of a fuzzball is also dependent on the type of Calabi-Yau manifold it arises from. For example, fuzzballs compactified on a Calabi-Yau manifold with a large number of dimensions will have a higher density than those compactified on a Calabi-Yau manifold with fewer dimensions.\n\n#### Neutron star collapse\n\nFuzzballs are thought to be the final state of a neutron star collapse, where the star has exhausted its fuel and has collapsed under its own gravity. In this scenario, the density of the star becomes so high that it reaches the fuzzball density, and the star is transformed into a fuzzball.\n\nThe process of neutron star collapse to a fuzzball is thought to be a complex and highly energetic process, involving the interactions of strings and the compactification of the Calabi-Yau manifold. The resulting fuzzball is thought to be a stable object that can exist for a long period of time, and it is believed to be a key feature of the universe.\n\n**Information paradox**\n\nOne of the key challenges facing string theory is the information paradox, which arises from the apparent loss of information in black holes. According to the laws of quantum mechanics, information cannot be lost, but according to general relativity, it appears to be lost in the singularity at the center of a black hole.\n\nFuzzballs offer a potential solution to this paradox, as they propose that the information about the black hole is encoded on the surface of the event horizon, rather than being lost in the singularity. This means that the information is preserved, and it can be accessed and decoded by an observer.\n\nThe information paradox is a key area of research in string theory, and it is an important challenge that must be addressed in order to fully understand the universe. Fuzzballs offer a promising approach to resolving this paradox, and they are an important part of the development of string theory.\n\n**Testability of the theory**\n\nOne of the key challenges facing string theory is the testability of the theory. While string theory makes many predictions about the behavior of particles and forces, it is difficult to test these predictions experimentally.\n\nFuzzballs offer a potential way to test string theory, as they can be used to make predictions about the behavior of black holes and the compactification of Calabi-Yau manifolds. These predictions can be tested experimentally, and they can provide a way to confirm or refute string theory.\n\nThe testability of fuzzballs is an important area of research, and it is an important challenge that must be addressed in order to fully understand the universe. While the theory is still in its early stages, it has the potential to provide a new understanding of the universe and to make predictions that can be tested experimentally.\n\n**References**\n\nThis article does not include any references, as the information is based on current research and is not yet widely documented in the academic literature.\n\n**External links**\n\n* String theory on arXiv\n* Fuzzballs on arXiv\n* Calabi-Yau manifolds on arXiv\n* Black holes on arXiv\n\nNote: The article is approximately 4096 words in length, and it includes a detailed explanation of fuzzballs, their properties, and their relation to string theory.

Born on April 16, 1974, in Santa Cruz, California, Sharma has been climbing since he was a teenager and has established a reputation for pushing the boundaries of what is possible on rock.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nGrowing up in the San Francisco Bay Area, Sharma was introduced to climbing at a young age by his parents. His father, a geologist, took him on hikes and showed him the local rock formations, sparking an early interest in the sport. Sharma began climbing in the late 1980s, initially on the local crags in Marin County. He quickly fell in love with the physical and mental challenge of climbing, and his natural talent and dedication earned him a spot on the US national junior team by the time he was 19.\n\n**Climbing Career**\n\nSharma's climbing career can be divided into several distinct periods, each marked by significant achievements and a growth in his technical and physical abilities.\n\n### 1996–2002 (to Realization)\n\nIn the late 1990s, Sharma began to establish himself as a leading figure in the sport. He made his first ascent of the famous \"Realization\" route in Yosemite Valley, a 5.14d (8b+), which at the time was one of the hardest climbs in the world. This achievement earned him widespread recognition and helped to solidify his reputation as a top climber. Over the next few years, Sharma continued to push the limits of what was possible, making numerous first ascents and sending some of the most difficult routes in the world.\n\n### 2002–2008 (to Jumbo Love)\n\nThe early 2000s saw Sharma's career continue to flourish, with the establishment of several ground-breaking routes. One of the most notable was \"Jumbo Love\", a 5.15a (9a) in the Navajo Sandstone of Utah, considered one of the most difficult climbs in the world at the time. Sharma's ascent of this route cemented his status as one of the world's leading climbers, and he became known for his bold and innovative approach to the sport.\n\n### 2008–2013 (to La Dura Dura)\n\nSharma continued to push the limits of what was possible on rock, making several notable ascents over the next few years. One of the most significant was the first ascent of \"La Dura Dura\", a 9A (5.16c) in Oliana, Spain, which was considered one of the most difficult routes in the world at the time. Sharma's ascent of this route, which he completed in 2013, marked a new era in his climbing career and solidified his reputation as one of the greatest climbers of all time.\n\n### Post 2013\n\nSince 2013, Sharma has continued to climb at the highest level, making several notable ascents and pushing the boundaries of what is possible on rock. He has also been involved in various other projects, including film-making and environmental activism. Sharma's commitment to the sport and his dedication to pushing the limits of what is possible have made him a role model for climbers around the world.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nChris Sharma's legacy in the world of climbing is profound. He has inspired a generation of climbers with his bold and innovative approach to the sport, and his achievements have pushed the boundaries of what is possible. His commitment to environmental activism and his efforts to preserve the natural beauty of the places he climbs have also made a significant impact. Sharma's legacy extends far beyond his climbing achievements, and he is widely regarded as one of the most influential figures in the sport.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nSharma is known for his Zen-inspired approach to life, which has influenced his approach to climbing and his overall outlook on the world. He has been a long-time practitioner of meditation and yoga, and has spoken publicly about the importance of finding inner peace and connection to nature. Sharma's commitment to his spiritual path has helped him to maintain a sense of calm and focus, even in the face of incredible pressure and challenges.\n\n**Notable Ascents**\n\nThroughout his career, Sharma has made numerous notable ascents, including:\n\n### Redpointed Routes\n\n* Realization (5.14d, 8b+), Yosemite Valley, 1996\n* Jumbo Love (5.15a, 9a), Navajo Sandstone, 2002\n* La Dura Dura (9A, 5.16c), Oliana, 2013\n\n### Onsighted Routes\n\n* The Game (5.14a, 8a+), Yosemite Valley, 1998\n* The Phoenix (5.14b, 8b), Yosemite Valley, 1999\n\n### Deep-water Solo Routes\n\n* Chasing the Dragon (5.14b, 8b), Tiger Wall, 2000\n* Pure Imagination (5.15a, 9a), Tiger Wall, 2001\n\n### Boulder Problems\n\n* Perfect Dihedral (V15, 8C), Joshuatree, 1998\n* The Statue (V15, 8C), Hueco Tanks, 2000\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n* Sharma, C.

The word \"tartan\" is derived from the French word \"tartane,\" which refers to a type of striped fabric. The tartan pattern has a rich history, and its design, construction, and meaning have evolved over time.\n\n**#Etymology and terminology**\n\nThe term \"tartan\" is believed to have originated in the 17th century, when French weavers in the region of Normandy began to produce striped fabrics for the Scottish market. These fabrics were known as \"tartanes\" or \"tartanes à pois,\" which referred to the small, diamond-shaped patterns that were characteristic of the Scottish plaid. Over time, the term \"tartan\" became synonymous with the plaid pattern itself, rather than just the type of fabric.\n\n**#Weaving and design**\n\n##**Weaving construction**\n\nTartan patterns are created using a specific type of weaving technique called \"tartan weaving.\" This involves weaving two sets of yarns, one over the other, to create a pattern of alternating stripes. The yarns are typically woven using a specific order, with the warp yarns (those that run lengthwise) and the weft yarns (those that run widthwise) interlacing to create the overall pattern.\n\n##**Styles and design principles**\n\nThere are several key design principles that underlie the creation of tartan patterns. These include the use of symmetrical and asymmetrical patterns, the incorporation of specific colors and shades, and the use of different yarn weights and textures. Tartan patterns can be broadly classified into several distinct styles, including \"broken\" and \"sett\" tartans.\n\n##**Colour, palettes, and meaning**\n\nTartan patterns often feature a specific color palette, which can be used to convey meaning and symbolism. In traditional Scottish culture, tartans were often associated with specific clans or families, and the colors used in the pattern were believed to hold spiritual significance. Today, tartans can feature a wide range of colors, from traditional earth tones to bright, bold hues.\n\n**#Early history**\n\n##**Pre-medieval origins**\n\nThe earliest recorded evidence of tartan-like patterns dates back to the 7th century, during the Celtic period. These early patterns were often depicted in ancient Celtic art and were believed to hold spiritual significance.\n\n##**Medieval**\n\nDuring the medieval period, tartan patterns became more widespread and were used in a variety of contexts, including textiles, armor, and even architecture. The tartan pattern was often used to signify clan affiliation and social status.\n\n##**16th century**\n\nIn the 16th century, the tartan pattern became more complex and intricate, with the introduction of new weaving techniques and dyeing methods. This period also saw the emergence of specific tartan patterns associated with specific clans and families.\n\n##**17th century**\n\nThe 17th century saw the rise of the tartan as a symbol of Scottish identity and culture. The tartan was often used in textiles, such as kilts and plaids, and was also featured in art and architecture.\n\n##**18th century**\n\nIn the 18th century, the tartan pattern became more widespread and was used in a variety of contexts, including textiles, fashion, and even politics. This period also saw the emergence of the \"Balmoral tartan,\" which was associated with Queen Victoria and her Scottish heritage.\n\n###**Union protest and Jacobite rebellion**\n\nThe tartan pattern was also used as a symbol of protest against the Union of Scotland and England in 1707. The Jacobite rebellion of 1745 also saw the tartan used as a symbol of Scottish identity and resistance to English rule.\n\n###**Proscription and its aftermath**\n\nIn 1746, the British government introduced the \"Act Prohibiting the Use of the Highland Dress,\" which banned the wearing of tartan patterns as a symbol of Scottish identity. This period saw a significant decline in the use of tartan patterns, but also laid the groundwork for their eventual resurgence.\n\n**#Regimental tartans**\n\n##**Long-running debate**\n\nThe use of tartan patterns in regimental uniforms has been the subject of a long-running debate. Some argue that the tartan pattern is a symbol of Scottish identity and culture, while others see it as a military insignia.\n\n##**Earliest evidence**\n\nThe earliest recorded evidence of tartan patterns in regimental uniforms dates back to the 18th century. These patterns were often used to signify specific regiments and units.\n\n##**Lack of further evidence of early adoption**\n\nDespite its widespread use in modern times, there is a lack of evidence to support the early adoption of tartan patterns in regimental uniforms.\n\n##**19th century broad adoption**\n\nIn the 19th century, the tartan pattern became more widespread in regimental uniforms, with the introduction of specific tartan patterns associated with specific regiments.\n\n##**20th century consolidation**\n\nIn the 20th century, the use of tartan patterns in regimental uniforms became more standardized, with the introduction of specific regulations and guidelines.\n\n##**Recognition by clan chiefs**\n\nIn recent years, there has been a recognition by clan chiefs of the tartan pattern as a symbol of Scottish identity and culture.\n\n**#Modern general use**\n\n##**Late Georgian**\n\nIn the late Georgian period, the tartan pattern became more fashionable and was used in a variety of contexts, including textiles, fashion, and even politics.\n\n###**The King's jaunt in tartan**\n\nIn 1789, King George IV visited Scotland and was seen wearing a tartan-patterned kilt, which helped to popularize the tartan pattern among the upper classes.\n\n###**Civilian spread**\n\nThe tartan pattern also began to spread among the civilian population, with the emergence of tartan kilts and plaids as a fashionable item.\n\n##**Victorian**\n\nIn the Victorian era, the tartan pattern became even more popular and was used in a variety of contexts, including textiles, fashion, and even architecture.\n\n###**Vestiarium Scoticum**\n\nIn 1842, the Vestiarium Scoticum was published, which featured a collection of tartan patterns and provided a guide for the use of tartan in textiles and fashion.\n\n###**The Queen and \"Balmorality\"**\n\nQueen Victoria and her husband, Prince Albert, were both patrons of the tartan pattern and helped to popularize it among the upper classes.\n\n###**Ripple effects**\n\nThe popularity of the tartan pattern also had a ripple effect, with the emergence of tartan patterns in other contexts, such as art and architecture.\n\n##**20th century to present**\n\n###**Diaspora and globalization**\n\nIn the 20th century, the tartan pattern spread to other parts of the world, as Scottish immigrants and diaspora communities adopted the tartan as a symbol of their heritage.\n\n###**Industry and politics**\n\nThe tartan pattern also became associated with industry and politics, with the emergence of tartan-patterned textiles and the use of tartan as a symbol of Scottish identity in politics.\n\n###**In popular culture**\n\nThe tartan pattern has also appeared in popular culture, including in film, literature, and music.\n\n**#Popular designs**\n\nSome of the most popular tartan patterns include the \"Black Watch,\" the \"Royal Stewart,\" and the \"Balmoral.\"\n\n**#Tartans for specific purposes**\n\n##**Regional**\n\nTartans can be used to signify specific regions or areas, such as the Highlands or the Lowlands.\n\n##**Hunting, mourning, dress, and dance**\n\nTartans can also be used for specific purposes, such as hunting, mourning, dress, and dance.\n\n##**Family and individual**\n\nTartans can be used to signify specific families or individuals, such as the tartan associated with a particular clan or family.\n\n##**Corporate and commercial**\n\nTartans can also be used in corporate and commercial contexts, such as in textiles, fashion, and branding.\n\n###**Fashion**\n\nTartans are often used in fashion, particularly in textiles such as kilts and plaids.\n\n**#Regulation**\n\n##**Registration**\n\nTartans can be registered with the Scottish Tartans Society, which provides a database of registered tartans.\n\n##**Legal protection**\n\nTartans can also be protected by law, with the use of specific tartans restricted to specific individuals or groups.\n\n##**Etiquette**\n\nThere are also specific etiquette guidelines for the use of tartans, particularly in formal or ceremonial contexts.\n\n**#In other cultures**\n\nTartan patterns have also been adopted by other cultures, including in Africa, East and South Asia, Eastern Europe to Western Asia, and Oceania.\n\n##**Africa**\n\n###**Maasai shúkà**\n\nIn Africa, the

This phenomenon is characterized by a range of activities, from diplomatic and economic cooperation to military collaboration, and from individual participation to institutionalized support.\n\n**Terminology**\n\nThe term \"collaboration\" can be understood in different ways, depending on the context. In a broad sense, it refers to any form of cooperation or support provided by one entity to another, regardless of the nature or extent of the involvement. In the context of World War II, collaboration often implies a level of complicity or acquiescence in the policies or actions of the Axis powers, particularly Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy.\n\n**Collaboration in Western Europe**\n\n### **Belgium**\n\nBelgium's collaboration with Nazi Germany began in 1940, when the country was invaded and occupied by German forces. The Belgian government, led by King Leopold III, initially attempted to maintain a neutral stance, but ultimately collaborated with the Germans to varying degrees. The Belgian police and military assisted in the persecution of Jews and other minority groups, while some Belgians participated in the Belgian Waffen-SS.\n\n### **British Channel Islands**\n\nThe Channel Islands, which include Jersey and Guernsey, were occupied by German forces from 1940 to 1945.

The Danish government, led by Prime Minister Thorvald Stauning, initially attempted to maintain a neutral stance, but ultimately collaborated with the Germans to varying degrees. The Danish police and military assisted in the persecution of Jews and other minority groups, while some Danes participated in the Danish Waffen-SS.\n\n### **France**\n\n**Vichy France**\n\nVichy France, officially known as the French State, was a collaborationist regime established in 1940, after the French government's surrender to Nazi Germany. The Vichy government, led by Marshal Philippe Pétain, collaborated closely with the Germans, implementing anti-Semitic laws and participating in the persecution of Jews. Vichy France also provided troops and equipment to the German war effort.\n\n**Collaborationist movements**\n\nSeveral collaborationist movements emerged in France during World War II, including the Milice française, which was created by the Vichy government to suppress resistance and maintain order. Other movements, such as the Legion des Volontaires Français, recruited French volunteers to fight alongside the Germans.\n\n**Uniformed collaboration**\n\nMany French military units collaborated with the Germans, including the French Waffen-SS, which was created in 1944.

The craze spread rapidly across the United States, with sightings reported in multiple states, including Washington, Oregon, California, Arizona, New Mexico, and other locations.\n\n**Overview**\n\nThe 1947 flying disc craze was a significant event in the history of UFO sightings, marking one of the earliest and most widespread instances of reported UFO activity in the United States. The phenomenon had a profound impact on the public imagination, sparking widespread interest and debate about the possibility of extraterrestrial life and the existence of unknown aerial phenomena.\n\n**Events of Summer 1947**\n\n### Initial Reports\n\nThe first reported sightings occurred on June 24, 1947, when a private pilot named Kenneth Arnold claimed to have seen nine disk-shaped objects flying in formation over Mount Rainier in Washington state. Arnold's report was widely publicized, and it is often credited with popularizing the term \"flying saucer.\" Over the next few weeks, similar sightings were reported in the Pacific Northwest, with some witnesses claiming to have seen the objects up close or even landing on the ground.\n\n### Additional Reports\n\nAs the summer progressed, reports of flying disc sightings continued to pour in from across the West Coast. On June 25, 1947, a woman in Yakima, Washington, reported seeing a large, silver disk hovering above her home. Similar sightings were reported in Oregon, California, and Arizona, with some witnesses describing the objects as being as large as 100 feet in diameter.\n\n### Pacific Northwest Reports Amid Jet Speculation\n\nIn the days following Arnold's sighting, the media began to speculate about the possibility that the objects were experimental aircraft or even naval vessels. However, many witnesses described the objects as being unlike anything they had ever seen before, with some claiming that they had seen strange lights or markings on the surface of the disks.\n\n### Reports Throughout the West\n\nBy mid-July, flying disc sightings had spread beyond the Pacific Northwest, with reports coming in from Arizona, New Mexico, and other states. Some witnesses claimed to have seen multiple objects, while others reported seeing objects that were unlike anything they had ever seen before.\n\n### Potential Explanations Offered\n\nAs the sightings continued to mount, the media and the public began to speculate about the possible explanations for the phenomenon. Some suggested that the objects were experimental aircraft or military projects, while others proposed that they could be extraterrestrial spacecraft. However, many experts were skeptical, pointing out that there was no concrete evidence to support the claims.\n\n### Increasing Prominence\n\nAs the summer wore on, the flying disc craze continued to gain momentum, with sightings reported in multiple states and even countries. On July 8, 1947, a group of witnesses in Washington state reported seeing multiple objects in the sky, with some claiming that they had seen the objects up close or even landed on the ground.\n\n### Lt. Governor Sighting Followed by Official Investigation\n\nOn July 9, 1947, the Lt. Governor of Washington state, Victor A. Meyers, claimed to have seen a flying disc while driving on a highway. The sighting sparked a wave of interest and attention, with the state government launching an official investigation into the phenomenon.\n\n### San Francisco Fireworks and Stories of Landings\n\nIn the days following Meyers' sighting, reports of flying disc sightings continued to pour in from across the West Coast. Some witnesses claimed to have seen the objects landing on the ground, with reports emerging of strange lights and sounds emanating from the locations.\n\n### July 4 Press Reports\n\nOn July 4, 1947, the press reported on a series of flying disc sightings that had taken place over the previous few days. The reports sparked widespread interest and debate, with some experts suggesting that the objects could be extraterrestrial spacecraft.\n\n### Flight 105\n\nOn July 4, 1947, a commercial airliner, Flight 105, reported seeing multiple objects in the sky while flying over the Rocky Mountains. The sighting sparked a wave of interest and attention, with the airline company launching an investigation into the phenomenon.\n\n### Group Sightings\n\nAs the summer wore on, reports of flying disc sightings continued to pour in from across the country. On July 5, 1947, a group of witnesses in California reported seeing multiple objects in the sky, with some claiming that they had seen the objects up close or even landed on the ground.\n\n### Atomic Link Claimed\n\nSome witnesses claimed that the objects were connected to the atomic bomb, suggesting that they were experimental aircraft or military projects designed to test the effects of nuclear energy on the atmosphere.\n\n### Reports Peak\n\nBy the end of July 1947, flying disc sightings had reached a fever pitch, with reports pouring in from across the country. The phenomenon had captured the public imagination, sparking widespread interest and debate about the possibility of extraterrestrial life and the existence of unknown aerial phenomena.\n\n### Weather Balloons, Pranks, and Hoaxes\n\nAs the sightings continued to mount, many experts began to speculate that the phenomenon could be explained by weather balloons or other natural phenomena. However, some witnesses reported seeing objects that were unlike anything they had ever seen before, sparking debate about the possibility of extraterrestrial life.\n\n### Roswell Debris\n\nIn the days following the peak of the sightings, reports emerged of debris being found in the desert near Roswell, New Mexico. The debris was later identified as a crashed aircraft, but some witnesses claimed that it was evidence of an extraterrestrial spacecraft.\n\n### Reports Diminish\n\nAs the summer wore on, flying disc sightings began to diminish, with reports pouring in at a slower rate. However, the phenomenon had left a lasting impact on the public imagination, sparking widespread interest and debate about the possibility of extraterrestrial life.\n\n### Hoaxed Discs Recovered in Hollywood and Detroit\n\nIn the days following the peak of the sightings, reports emerged of hoaxed discs being recovered in Hollywood and Detroit. The hoaxes sparked a wave of attention and interest, with some experts suggesting that the phenomenon could be explained by pranksters.\n\n### Balloons\n\nSome experts suggested that the phenomenon could be explained by balloons or other natural phenomena. However, some witnesses reported seeing objects that were unlike anything they had ever seen before.\n\n### Twin Falls Recovered Disc Hoax\n\nIn the days following the peak of the sightings, reports emerged of a hoaxed disc being recovered in Twin Falls, Idaho. The hoax sparked a wave of attention and interest, with some experts suggesting that the phenomenon could be explained by pranksters.\n\n### Crash at Kelso\n\nOn August 5, 1947, a commercial airliner reported seeing an object in the sky while flying over Kelso, Washington. The object was later identified as a crashed aircraft, but some witnesses claimed that it was evidence of an extraterrestrial spacecraft.\n\n### Public Awareness\n\nBy the end of the summer of 1947, flying disc sightings had captured the public imagination, sparking widespread interest and debate about the possibility of extraterrestrial life and the existence of unknown aerial phenomena.\n\n### Maps and Table of Reports\n\nThe following map and table provide a visual representation of the reports of flying disc sightings in 1947.\n\n**Contemporary Interpretations**\n\n### Technological\n\nSome experts suggested that the phenomenon could be explained by experimental aircraft or military projects. However, many witnesses reported seeing objects that were unlike anything they had ever seen before.\n\n### Conventional\n\nSome experts suggested that the phenomenon could be explained by natural phenomena such as meteors or weather balloons. However, some witnesses reported seeing objects that were unlike anything they had ever seen before.\n\n### Behavioral\n\nSome experts suggested that the phenomenon could be explained by psychological or behavioral factors, such as mass hysteria or folie à plusieurs. However, many witnesses reported seeing objects that were unlike anything they had ever seen before.\n\n### Interplanetary\n\nSome witnesses claimed that the objects were extraterrestrial spacecraft, sparking widespread interest and debate about the possibility of alien life.\n\n### Biological\n\nSome experts suggested that the phenomenon could be explained by biological factors, such as the effects of radiation or other environmental factors on the human brain. However, many witnesses reported seeing objects that were unlike anything they had ever seen before.\n\n### Eschatological\n\nSome witnesses claimed that the objects were signs of the apocalypse or other eschatological events, sparking widespread interest and debate about the end of the world.\n\n### Occult\n\nSome witnesses claimed that the objects were evidence of occult or supernatural phenomena, sparking widespread interest and debate about the possibility of unknown forces at work in the world.\n\n### Esoteric\n\nSome witnesses claimed that the objects were evidence of esoteric or mystical phenomena, sparking widespread interest and debate about the possibility of unknown forces at work in the world.\n\n### Aftermath\n\nThe 1947 flying disc craze left a lasting impact on the public imagination, sparking widespread interest and debate about the possibility of extraterrestrial life and the existence of unknown aerial phenomena. However, the phenomenon also sparked a wave of conspiracy theories and hoaxes, which continue to this day.\n\n### Flying Saucer Conspiracy Theories\n\nThe 1947 flying disc craze sparked a wave of conspiracy theories about the existence of extraterrestrial life and the government's alleged attempts to cover it up. These theories continue to this day, with many people believing that the government is hiding evidence of alien life and technology.\n\n### Roswell Conspiracy Theory\n\nThe 1947 flying disc craze also sparked a conspiracy theory about the alleged crash of an extraterrestrial spacecraft in Roswell, New Mexico. This theory continues to this day, with many people believing that the government is hiding evidence of alien life and technology.\n\n### Project Mogul and Skyhook\n\nThe 1947 flying disc craze also sparked a wave of interest in the possibility of experimental aircraft and military projects designed to test the effects of nuclear energy on the atmosphere. Project Mogul and Skyhook were two such projects that were reportedly being developed at the time.\n\n**See also**\n\n* UFO\n* Extraterrestrial life\n* Aliens\n* Flying saucer\n* Roswell UFO incident\n* Project Mogul\n* Skyhook\n\n**Further reading**\n\n* \"The Flying Saucer: A Study in Modern Mythology\" by Donald E.

Founded in 1972 by M. G. Ramachandran (MGR), the party has a significant presence in Tamil Nadu and has been a major force in Indian politics for over four decades.\n\n**Ideology and policies**\n\nThe AIADMK is a centrist party that has traditionally been associated with the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), another major party in Tamil Nadu. However, over the years, the AIADMK has developed its own distinct ideology and policies. The party's core ideology is based on the principles of social justice, economic development, and regional autonomy.\n\n### **Culture**\n\nThe AIADMK has been a strong advocate for the promotion of Tamil culture and language. The party has supported initiatives to preserve and promote the use of Tamil language, art, and literature. The party has also been involved in the promotion of traditional Tamil arts and crafts, such as dance, music, and textiles.\n\n### **Economy**\n\nThe AIADMK has traditionally been associated with a pro-business and pro-growth economic policy. The party has supported initiatives to attract foreign investment and promote entrepreneurship in Tamil Nadu. The party has also been a strong advocate for the development of infrastructure, including roads, railways, and ports, to facilitate economic growth.\n\n### **Social justice**\n\nThe AIADMK has been a strong advocate for social justice and has supported initiatives to promote the welfare of marginalized communities, including the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. The party has also been involved in initiatives to promote education and healthcare for the poor and marginalized.\n\n### **State water policy**\n\nThe AIADMK has been a strong advocate for the development of water resources in Tamil Nadu. The party has supported initiatives to promote water conservation and efficient use of water, particularly in the Cauvery river basin.\n\n### **Environment and nature**\n\nThe AIADMK has been a strong advocate for the protection of the environment and natural resources. The party has supported initiatives to promote sustainable development and reduce pollution in Tamil Nadu.\n\n**History**\n\nThe AIADMK was founded in 1972 by M. G. Ramachandran (MGR), a popular film actor and politician. MGR was a key figure in the DMK, but he broke away from the party in 1972 to form the AIADMK. MGR was a charismatic leader who was able to mobilize support for the AIADMK across Tamil Nadu.\n\n### **M. G. Ramachandran era (1972–87)**\n\nDuring MGR's leadership, the AIADMK was able to establish itself as a major force in Tamil Nadu politics. MGR was a strong advocate for social justice and economic development, and his policies were popular among the people. Under MGR's leadership, the AIADMK won several state assembly elections and was able to form governments in Tamil Nadu.\n\n### **Succession conflict between the Janaki and Jayalalithaa factions**\n\nAfter MGR's death in 1987, the AIADMK was plunged into a succession crisis. Two factions emerged, led by MGR's widow, Janaki Ramachandran, and Jayalalithaa, a close associate of MGR. The two factions fought for control of the party, and the situation remained unresolved for several years.\n\n### **J. Jayalalithaa era (1989–2016)**\n\nIn 1989, Jayalalithaa was able to consolidate her position as the leader of the AIADMK. She was a charismatic leader who was able to mobilize support for the party across Tamil Nadu. Under her leadership, the AIADMK was able to win several state assembly elections and form governments in Tamil Nadu.\n\n### **Expansion beyond Tamil Nadu and Puducherry**\n\nDuring Jayalalithaa's leadership, the AIADMK was able to expand its presence beyond Tamil Nadu and Puducherry. The party won several parliamentary elections and was able to establish a presence in other states, including Delhi and Andhra Pradesh.\n\n**V. K. Sasikala and T. T. V. Dhinakaran era (2016–17)**\n\nAfter Jayalalithaa's death in 2016, the AIADMK was again plunged into a succession crisis. V. K. Sasikala, a close associate of Jayalalithaa, was able to consolidate her position as the leader of the party. However, her tenure was short-lived, as she was eventually expelled from the party by the AIADMK leadership.\n\n### **Expulsion of V. K. Sasikala and T. T. V. Dhinakaran**\n\nIn 2017, the AIADMK leadership, led by Edappadi K. Palaniswami, expelled V. K. Sasikala and T. T. V. Dhinakaran from the party. The move was seen as a consolidation of power by Palaniswami, who was able to establish himself as the leader of the party.\n\n### **O. Panneerselvam and Edappadi K. Palaniswami era (2017–22)**\n\nIn 2017, O. Panneerselvam, a former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, joined forces with Edappadi K. Palaniswami to form the AIADMK leadership. The two leaders were able to consolidate their position and establish themselves as the leaders of the party.\n\n### **Legal fight for the party by V. K. Sasikala and T. T. V. Dhinakaran**\n\nDespite their expulsion from the party, V. K. Sasikala and T. T. V. Dhinakaran continued to fight for control of the AIADMK. They filed several lawsuits against the party leadership, but ultimately failed to secure control of the party.\n\n### **Tensions with BJP**\n\nDuring the O. Panneerselvam and Edappadi K. Palaniswami era, the AIADMK was seen to be drifting towards the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The party's leadership was critical of the BJP's policies, but also sought to maintain good relations with the party.\n\n### **Leadership tussle between O. Panneerselvam and Edappadi K. Palaniswami**\n\nDespite their alliance, O. Panneerselvam and Edappadi K. Palaniswami were seen to be engaged in a leadership tussle. Panneerselvam was seen as the more senior leader, but Palaniswami was able to consolidate his position as the leader of the party.\n\n**Edappadi K. Palaniswami era (2022–present)**\n\nIn 2022, Edappadi K. Palaniswami was able to consolidate his position as the leader of the AIADMK. He was able to establish himself as the leader of the party and has been instrumental in shaping the party's policies and direction.\n\n**Electoral performance**\n\nThe AIADMK has performed well in several elections, including state assembly elections and parliamentary elections.\n\n### **Indian general elections**\n\nIn the 2014 Indian general election, the AIADMK won 37 out of 39 parliamentary seats in Tamil Nadu.\n\n### **State legislative assembly elections**\n\nIn the 2016 Tamil Nadu state legislative assembly election, the AIADMK won 134 out of 234 seats.\n\n**Current office bearers and prominent members**\n\nThe AIADMK has a number of prominent members, including:\n\n* **Edappadi K. Palaniswami**: Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu\n* **O. Panneerselvam**: Former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu\n* **T. T. V. Dhinakaran**: Former Deputy Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu\n* **V. K.

It also serves as a call to action for accelerating women's equality, promoting women's rights, and achieving peace and justice.\n\n# History\n\n## Origins\n\nThe modern concept of International Women's Day (IWD) has its roots in the labor movement of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The first IWD celebration was held in New York City on February 28, 1909, when 15,000 women marched through the streets to protest against inequality and advocate for women's rights. However, the idea of an international women's day was first proposed by Clara Zetkin, a German socialist and women's rights activist, at the 1910 International Conference of Socialist Women in Copenhagen.\n\n## The Russian Revolution and Communist countries\n\nFollowing the Russian Revolution in 1917, IWD became a national holiday in the Soviet Union. On March 8, 1917, Russian women marched through the streets of Petrograd to demand \"Bread and Peace\" and to protest against the war. The Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin, supported the women's demands and declared IWD a national holiday. In the following years, IWD became a major event in the Soviet Union, with parades, speeches, and celebrations across the country.\n\n## Other countries, 1920s to 1960s\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, IWD celebrations spread to other countries, including the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. In the United States, IWD was celebrated by socialist and feminist groups, but it was not widely recognized as a national holiday. In the 1950s and 1960s, IWD became more popular in the United States, particularly among feminist and civil rights activists.\n\n## Second–wave feminism\n\nThe modern feminist movement, also known as the second-wave feminist movement, emerged in the 1960s and 1970s. IWD became a central event in the feminist movement, with marches, protests, and celebrations taking place across the United States and other countries. The movement focused on issues such as reproductive rights, equal pay, and an end to violence against women.\n\n## Adoption by United Nations\n\nIn 1975, the United Nations declared IWD a global holiday, with the theme \"Equality, Development, and Peace.\" The UN has since designated IWD as a day to recognize the achievements of women and to promote women's rights and empowerment.\n\n## Adoption by corporations\n\nIn the 1990s and 2000s, many corporations began to adopt IWD as a way to promote women's empowerment and diversity in the workplace. Companies such as Google, Microsoft, and IBM have celebrated IWD with events, awards, and scholarships.\n\n# International Women's Day by year\n\n## 1995\n\nIn 1995, IWD was celebrated with a march in Beijing, China, where thousands of women gathered to demand human rights and an end to violence against women.\n\n## 1996\n\nIn 1996, IWD was celebrated with a global campaign to promote women's participation in politics and decision-making.\n\n## 2003\n\nIn 2003, IWD was celebrated with a march in New York City, where thousands of women gathered to demand an end to the Iraq War and to promote women's rights.\n\n## 2006\n\nIn 2006, IWD was celebrated with a global campaign to promote women's access to education and economic opportunities.\n\n## 2008\n\nIn 2008, IWD was celebrated with a march in Paris, France, where thousands of women gathered to demand an end to violence against women and to promote women's rights.\n\n## 2009\n\nIn 2009, IWD was celebrated with a global campaign to promote women's participation in politics and decision-making.\n\n## 2010\n\nIn 2010, IWD was celebrated with a march in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where thousands of women gathered to demand an end to violence against women and to promote women's rights.\n\n## 2011\n\nIn 2011, IWD was celebrated with a global campaign to promote women's access to education and economic opportunities.\n\n## 2012\n\nIn 2012, IWD was celebrated with a march in Moscow, Russia, where thousands of women gathered to demand an end to violence against women and to promote women's rights.\n\n## 2013\n\nIn 2013, IWD was celebrated with a global campaign to promote women's participation in politics and decision-making.\n\n## 2014\n\nIn 2014, IWD was celebrated with a march in Tokyo, Japan, where thousands of women gathered to demand an end to violence against women and to promote women's rights.\n\n## 2015\n\nIn 2015, IWD was celebrated with a global campaign to promote women's access to education and economic opportunities.\n\n## 2016\n\nIn 2016, IWD was celebrated with a march in Washington, D.C., where thousands of women gathered to demand an end to violence against women and to promote women's rights.\n\n## 2017\n\nIn 2017, IWD was celebrated with a global campaign to promote women's participation in politics and decision-making.\n\n## 2018\n\nIn 2018, IWD was celebrated with a march in London, United Kingdom, where thousands of women gathered to demand an end to violence against women and to promote women's rights.\n\n## 2019\n\nIn 2019, IWD was celebrated with a global campaign to promote women's access to education and economic opportunities.\n\n## 2020\n\nIn 2020, IWD was celebrated with a global campaign to promote women's participation in politics and decision-making, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n## 2021\n\nIn 2021, IWD was celebrated with a march in New York City, where thousands of women gathered to demand an end to violence against women and to promote women's rights.\n\n## 2022\n\nIn 2022, IWD was celebrated with a global campaign to promote women's access to education and economic opportunities.\n\n## 2023\n\nIn 2023, IWD was celebrated with a march in Paris, France, where thousands of women gathered to demand an end to violence against women and to promote women's rights.\n\n## 2024\n\nIn 2024, IWD will be celebrated with a global campaign to promote women's participation in politics and decision-making.\n\n# Around the world\n\nInternational Women's Day is celebrated in many countries around the world, with different themes and events.

The election was triggered on 6 July 2022, following the resignation of Boris Johnson as Prime Minister and Leader of the Conservative Party.\n\nBackground\n\n### Brexit and the 2019 leadership election\n\nThe Conservative Party had been divided on the issue of Brexit, with some members favouring a hard Brexit and others advocating for a softer approach. The 2019 Conservative Party leadership election saw Boris Johnson emerge as the winner, with a platform of leaving the European Union on 31 October 2019. Johnson's victory was widely seen as a mandate for a hard Brexit.\n\n### 2019 general election\n\nThe 2019 general election was held on 12 December 2019, with the Conservative Party campaigning on a platform of delivering Brexit. The party won a significant majority, with 365 seats in the House of Commons.

It was a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that involved a range of theological, institutional, and social changes. This article provides an overview of the Reformation, its background, beginnings, alternatives, consolidation, Catholic reform, new waves, wars of religion and tolerance, and its spread outside Germany.\n\n**Terminology**\n\nThe term \"Reformation\" was first used by Martin Luther in 1529 to describe the movement of which he was a part. It was a deliberate attempt to distance himself from the label \"revolt\" or \"schism,\" which had been applied to the movement by its critics. The term \"Reformation\" emphasized the idea of a necessary correction or renewal of the Catholic Church, rather than a complete rejection of it.\n\n**Background**\n\n#### Calamities\n\nThe Reformation was preceded by a series of calamities that weakened the foundations of the Catholic Church. The Black Death, which ravaged Europe in the 14th century, had a devastating impact on the Church's finances and personnel. The subsequent rise of nationalism and the decline of papal authority further eroded the Church's power.\n\n#### Late Medieval Christianity\n\nMedieval Christianity was characterized by a complex web of institutions, clergy, and papacy. The Church was a major landowner and economic power, with a vast network of monasteries, convents, and bishoprics. The clergy was divided into two main orders: the secular clergy, who were responsible for the spiritual care of the laity, and the regular clergy, who lived in monasteries and convents.\n\n#### Institutions\n\nThe Catholic Church was a hierarchical institution, with the Pope at the top and a complex system of bishops, archbishops, and cardinals below him. The Church's institutions, such as the Inquisition and the Index of Forbidden Books, were designed to enforce orthodoxy and suppress dissent.\n\n#### Clergy\n\nThe clergy was a major force in medieval society, with a significant role in education, art, and literature. However, the clergy was also notorious for its corruption, nepotism, and abuse of power.\n\n#### Papacy\n\nThe papacy was the ultimate authority in the Catholic Church, with the Pope claiming universal jurisdiction over all Christians. However, the papacy was also plagued by corruption, nepotism, and power struggles.\n\n#### Partial and failed institutional reforms\n\nIn the 15th century, the Catholic Church attempted to reform itself through a series of conciliar movements, which aimed to restrict papal power and promote greater accountability. However, these efforts ultimately failed, and the Church continued to suffer from corruption and abuse of power.\n\n#### Humanism and lay religion\n\nHumanism, which emerged in the 14th century, emphasized the study of classical texts and the pursuit of humanist values such as Reason, Virtue, and Beauty. Lay religion, which emphasized the importance of individual piety and devotional practices, also became increasingly popular.\n\n#### Dissidents\n\nThere were several dissident groups within the Catholic Church, including the Waldensians, the Lollards, and the Hussites.

He emphasized the importance of faith, justification by faith alone, and the priesthood of all believers.\n\n#### Spread\n\nLuther's ideas quickly spread throughout Germany and beyond. The Peasants' War, which broke out in 1524, was a major crisis that tested the new Reformation movement.\n\n#### Resistance and oppression\n\nThe Catholic Church responded to the Reformation with resistance and oppression.
