The outbreak was first reported in May 2022 and has since spread to multiple countries around the world.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Emergency Preparedness Prior to Outbreak\n\nEmergency preparedness measures were in place prior to the outbreak. In recent years, there had been concerns about the potential for mpox to spread globally due to its highly contagious nature and the lack of effective treatments. As a result, public health agencies and governments had been working to strengthen their preparedness and response plans.\n\n### Endemic Mpox in Africa\n\nMpox has been endemic in certain parts of Africa for decades. The virus is typically found in remote rural areas, where it is transmitted to humans through close contact with infected animals, such as rodents and primates. In these areas, mpox is often a mild disease, and most people who are infected do not require medical attention.\n\n**Outbreak Characteristics**\n\n### Phylogenetics\n\nThe 2022–2023 mpox outbreak is caused by a distinct strain of the monkeypox virus, which is different from the strains that are normally found in Africa. This strain has been identified as a member of the West African lineage of the virus, which is known to be more contagious and severe than the Central African lineage.\n\n### Long Incubation Periods\n\nOne of the key characteristics of the 2022–2023 mpox outbreak is the long incubation periods of the disease. Symptoms can take anywhere from 5 to 21 days to appear after exposure, which makes it difficult for people to know if they have been infected and for public health agencies to track the spread of the disease.\n\n### Mild Clinical Manifestations\n\nThe symptoms of mpox are typically mild and can include fever, headache, muscle aches, and a rash. In most cases, the disease is self-limiting, and people recover on their own without medical treatment. However, in some cases, the disease can be more severe, and people may experience respiratory symptoms, such as pneumonia.\n\n### Fear of Zoonotic Spread\n\nThere is a concern that the 2022–2023 mpox outbreak could be a zoonotic disease, meaning that it could be transmitted from animals to humans. While there is no evidence to suggest that this is the case, public health agencies are taking precautions to prevent the spread of the disease from animals to humans.\n\n**Chronology**\n\n### Deaths Outside of Africa\n\nAs of July 2023, there have been several reported deaths outside of Africa, including in the United States, Canada, and Europe. These deaths are likely due to the high contagiousness of the strain of the virus that is causing the outbreak.\n\n**Transmission**\n\n### Transmission Patterns\n\nThe transmission patterns of mpox are not fully understood, but it is thought to be spread through close contact with infected people, such as through skin-to-skin contact, respiratory droplets, and contaminated surfaces. Public health agencies are working to identify the sources of transmission and to prevent the spread of the disease.\n\n### Wastewater Surveillance\n\nWastewater surveillance is being used to detect the presence of the monkeypox virus in the environment. This includes testing wastewater samples for the presence of the virus, as well as monitoring for changes in wastewater quality that may indicate the presence of the virus.\n\n**Interventions**\n\n### Testing and Containment\n\nTesting and containment are key interventions being used to control the spread of mpox. Public health agencies are working to identify and isolate people who are infected, as well as to contact-trace people who may have been exposed to the disease.\n\n### Vaccination\n\nVaccination is also being used to control the spread of mpox. There is a licensed vaccine against mpox, which is being used to vaccinate people who are at high risk of exposure, such as healthcare workers and laboratory personnel.\n\n**Social Aspects**\n\n### Misinformation\n\nThere is a concern that misinformation about mpox is spreading, which can lead to confusion and anxiety among the public. Public health agencies are working to provide accurate and timely information about the outbreak, as well as to correct misinformation that is being spread.\n\n**Responses**\n\n### World Health Organization\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the 2022–2023 mpox outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). This declaration has led to increased global attention and resources being devoted to controlling the spread of the disease.\n\n### Countries\n\nMany countries have implemented measures to control the spread of mpox, including testing, contact-tracing, and vaccination. Some countries have also implemented travel restrictions and quarantine measures to prevent the spread of the disease.\n\n### Dependent Territories\n\nSome dependent territories have also implemented measures to control the spread of mpox.

The league is governed by the Indonesian Football Association (PSSI) and features 18 teams competing for the title. The league's history dates back to 1930, with the current format established in 2013.\n\n# History\n\n## Origins\n\nThe first football league in Indonesia was established in 1930 by the Dutch colonial authorities, with the aim of promoting sports and entertainment in the colony. The league was initially known as the Voetbal Bond van Buitengewesten (VBB) and featured teams from the Dutch East Indies, which included present-day Indonesia. The league was dominated by teams from the major cities of Java, Sumatra, and Kalimantan.\n\n## Foundation\n\nAfter Indonesia gained independence in 1945, the Indonesian Football Association (PSSI) was established in 1930, with the aim of promoting and developing football in the country. The PSSI took over the administration of the league and introduced reforms to improve the competition format and player development. The league was renamed the Indonesia Football League (IFL) in 1947 and featured 12 teams competing for the title.\n\n## Dualism\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, the PSSI introduced a dual league system, with the top division featuring the best teams in the country. The second division, known as the Indonesia Second Division, featured teams that were relegated from the top division or promoted from the lower divisions. This system was maintained until the 1980s, when the PSSI introduced a unified league format.\n\n## Government intervention and FIFA suspension\n\nIn the 1990s, the PSSI faced several challenges, including government intervention and financial difficulties. In 1994, the PSSI was suspended by FIFA due to government interference in the association's affairs. The suspension was lifted in 1996, but the PSSI continued to face challenges, including financial difficulties and corruption.\n\n## Name change\n\nIn 2013, the PSSI renamed the top division the Indonesia Super League (ISL), with the aim of promoting the league and improving its international reputation. However, the name was later changed to Liga 1 in 2017, as part of a broader rebranding effort by the PSSI.\n\n# Competition format\n\n## Competition\n\nLiga 1 features 18 teams competing in a double round-robin format, with each team playing the other 17 teams twice, once at home and once away. The team with the most points at the end of the season is crowned the champion. If two or more teams are tied on points, the team with the better goal difference is crowned the champion. If the goal difference is also tied, the team with the most goals scored is crowned the champion.\n\n## Promotion and relegation\n\nThe bottom three teams in Liga 1 are relegated to the second division, known as Liga 2, while the top three teams in Liga 2 are promoted to Liga 1. This system has been in place since the 2013 season.\n\n## Video assistant referee\n\nLiga 1 introduced video assistant referee (VAR) technology in the 2019 season, with the aim of improving the accuracy of refereeing decisions. VAR technology allows the referee to review certain decisions using video footage, and make corrections if necessary.\n\n# Clubs\n\n## Champions\n\nA number of clubs have won the Liga 1 title since its inception.

This means that the game's source code is made available to the public, allowing anyone to modify and distribute the game as they see fit. Open-source video games have been around since the early days of computer gaming, but they have gained popularity in recent years due to the rise of independent game development and the growing community of hobbyists and enthusiasts.\n\n**Definition and differentiation**\n\nOpen-source video games are distinct from proprietary video games in several key ways. Unlike proprietary games, which are typically developed and published by a single company, open-source games are often developed by a community of individuals working together to create a game. This can result in a more collaborative and transparent development process, as well as a greater degree of community involvement and participation.\n\nAnother key difference between open-source and proprietary games is the level of access to the game's source code. In open-source games, the source code is typically made available to the public, allowing anyone to view, modify, and distribute the code as they see fit. This can be beneficial for several reasons, including:\n\n* **Community involvement**: By making the source code available, developers can encourage community members to contribute to the game's development, which can lead to a more diverse and robust game.\n* **Bug fixing**: By allowing community members to view and modify the source code, developers can fix bugs and make improvements to the game more quickly and efficiently.\n* **Customization**: By making the source code available, developers can allow community members to customize the game to their liking, which can lead to a more tailored and personalized gaming experience.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe concept of open-source video games has its roots in the early days of computer gaming. One of the first open-source games was \"Tremulous,\" a first-person shooter released in 2006. Tremulous was developed by a community of individuals working together to create a game that was both fun and challenging. The game's source code was made available to the public, and it quickly gained a following among gamers and developers alike.\n\nAnother early open-source game was \"Battle for Wesnoth,\" a turn-based strategy game released in 2005. Battle for Wesnoth was developed by a team of individuals working together to create a game that was both engaging and challenging. The game's source code was made available to the public, and it quickly gained a following among gamers and developers alike.\n\n**History**\n\n#### Beginnings and early games\n\nThe first open-source games were typically small-scale projects developed by individuals or small groups of developers. These early games were often simple in design and scope, but they laid the foundation for the open-source gaming movement.\n\nOne of the first open-source games was \"Torcs,\" a racing game released in 2000. Torcs was developed by a single individual, and it was one of the first games to use the open-source license. The game's source code was made available to the public, and it quickly gained a following among gamers and developers alike.\n\nAnother early open-source game was \"Nexuiz,\" a first-person shooter released in 2005. Nexuiz was developed by a team of individuals working together to create a game that was both fun and challenging. The game's source code was made available to the public, and it quickly gained a following among gamers and developers alike.\n\n#### 3D games and source releases\n\nThe mid-2000s saw a significant increase in the development of 3D open-source games. One of the most notable examples was \"Sauerbraten,\" a first-person shooter released in 2007. Sauerbraten was developed by a team of individuals working together to create a game that was both fun and challenging. The game's source code was made available to the public, and it quickly gained a following among gamers and developers alike.\n\nAnother notable example was \"Cube 2: Sauerbraten,\" a first-person shooter released in 2007. Cube 2: Sauerbraten was developed by a team of individuals working together to create a game that was both fun and challenging. The game's source code was made available to the public, and it quickly gained a following among gamers and developers alike.\n\n#### Rise in popularity and diversity\n\nThe late 2000s saw a significant increase in the popularity of open-source games. This was due in part to the rise of independent game development and the growing community of hobbyists and enthusiasts.\n\nOne of the most notable examples of this trend was the development of \"OpenArena,\" a first-person shooter released in 2007. OpenArena was developed by a team of individuals working together to create a game that was both fun and challenging. The game's source code was made available to the public, and it quickly gained a following among gamers and developers alike.\n\nAnother notable example was the development of \"Irrlicht Engine,\" a game engine released in 2007. Irrlicht Engine was developed by a team of individuals working together to create a game engine that was both powerful and flexible. The engine's source code was made available to the public, and it quickly gained a following among game developers and hobbyists alike.\n\n#### Greater organization\n\nThe early 2010s saw a significant increase in the organization of the open-source gaming community. This was due in part to the rise of social media and online platforms, which made it easier for developers and hobbyists to connect and collaborate.\n\nOne of the most notable examples of this trend was the development of the \"Open Game Art\" platform, which was launched in 2010. Open Game Art was a platform that allowed developers to share and collaborate on game assets, such as graphics and sound effects. The platform was a huge success, and it quickly became a go-to resource for developers and hobbyists alike.\n\nAnother notable example was the development of the \"GameJolt\" platform, which was launched in 2010.

Neoplatonism emphasizes the ultimate reality of a unified, all-encompassing source of being, and the interconnectedness of all things. This article will explore the origins and history of classical Neoplatonism, its core ideas, and its significant influences on Western philosophy and spirituality.\n\n**Origins of the term**\n\nThe term \"Neoplatonism\" was coined in the 18th century to distinguish the philosophical movement from the original teachings of Plato. However, the philosophical ideas that would become known as Neoplatonism originated in the 3rd century AD, in the context of Greek philosophy and spirituality.\n\n**Origins and history of classical Neoplatonism**\n\n### Hellenism\n\nThe Hellenistic period, which spanned from the 3rd to the 1st century BC, saw the rise of various philosophical schools, including Stoicism, Epicureanism, and Aristotelianism. These schools emphasized reason, logic, and the pursuit of happiness. The Hellenistic tradition provided a rich intellectual and cultural context for the development of Neoplatonism.\n\n### Ammonius Saccas\n\nAmmonius Saccas (c. 175-242 AD) is often regarded as the founder of Neoplatonism. Born in Alexandria, Egypt, Ammonius was a philosopher and theologian who synthesized elements of Platonism, Aristotelianism, and mysticism. He taught in Rome and Egypt, attracting a devoted following of students, including Plotinus.\n\n### Plotinus\n\nPlotinus (c. 205-270 AD) was a prominent Neoplatonist philosopher who wrote extensively on metaphysics, ethics, and spirituality. Born in Lycopolis, Egypt, Plotinus studied under Ammonius Saccas and later founded a school in Rome, where he taught for many years. His philosophical ideas would become the foundation of classical Neoplatonism.\n\n### Porphyry\n\nPorphyry (c. 234-305 AD) was a Neoplatonist philosopher and theologian who succeeded Plotinus as the leader of the school in Rome. Born in Tyre, Phoenicia, Porphyry wrote extensively on philosophy, theology, and theurgy (mystical practices). He systematized Plotinus' ideas and wrote a biography of his teacher.\n\n### Iamblichus\n\nIamblichus (c. 245-325 AD) was a Neoplatonist philosopher and theologian who founded a school in Apamea, Syria. Born in Chalcis, Cilicia, Iamblichus was a prominent figure in the development of Neoplatonism, and his teachings emphasized the importance of theurgy and the divine.\n\n### Academies\n\nThe Neoplatonist tradition established a series of schools and academies throughout the Mediterranean region. These institutions provided a platform for philosophical and spiritual inquiry, attracting scholars and students from diverse backgrounds. The Neoplatonist academies played a significant role in shaping Western philosophy and spirituality.\n\n### Hypatia\n\nHypatia (c. 350-415 AD) was a Neoplatonist philosopher and mathematician who taught in Alexandria. Born in Alexandria, Egypt, Hypatia was a prominent figure in the city's intellectual and spiritual life. Her teachings emphasized the importance of reason, intellect, and spiritual growth.\n\n### Proclus\n\nProclus (c. 412-485 AD) was a Neoplatonist philosopher and theologian who succeeded Hypatia as the leader of the school in Alexandria. Born in Constantinople, Proclus wrote extensively on philosophy, theology, and theurgy. His teachings emphasized the importance of the divine and the interconnectedness of all things.\n\n**Ideas**\n\n### The One\n\nThe concept of the One (or the Unity) is central to Neoplatonism. The One is the ultimate source of being, the origin of all things, and the ultimate reality. The One is beyond human comprehension, and its nature is ineffable.\n\n### Emanations\n\nNeoplatonism posits that the One emanates a series of divine beings, each with its own distinct characteristics and functions. These beings are:\n\n* **Demiurge or nous**: The Demiurge (or nous) is the divine intelligence that shapes the world and governs the universe.\n* **World-soul**: The world-soul is the divine essence that animates the universe and connects all things.\n* **Phenomenal world**: The phenomenal world is the material realm, governed by the principles of causality and necessity.\n\n### Celestial hierarchy\n\nNeoplatonism posits a hierarchical structure of celestial beings, each with its own distinct characteristics and functions. The hierarchy includes:\n\n* **Intelligibles**: The intelligibles are the highest level of being, comprising the divine intelligences and the world-soul.\n* **Spirits**: The spirits are the intermediate level of being, comprising the souls of the blessed and the demons.\n* **Matter**: Matter is the lowest level of being, comprising the material realm and the phenomenal world.\n\n### Evil\n\nNeoplatonism posits that evil is a privation of being, a lack of the divine essence. Evil is not a positive entity, but rather a negation of the good.\n\n### Return to the One\n\nThe ultimate goal of Neoplatonism is the return to the One, the ultimate source of being. This return is achieved through spiritual growth, self-purification, and the attainment of gnosis (spiritual knowledge).\n\n**Influence**\n\n### Early Christianity\n\nNeoplatonism had a significant influence on early Christianity, particularly on the teachings of Augustine of Hippo. Augustine incorporated elements of Neoplatonism into his Christian theology, emphasizing the importance of the divine and the interconnectedness of all things.\n\n### Origen and Pseudo-Dionysius\n\nOrigen (c. 185-254 AD) and Pseudo-Dionysius (c. 500 AD) were Neoplatonist philosophers and theologians who wrote extensively on the nature of God and the universe. Their teachings emphasized the importance of the divine and the mystical experience.\n\n### Gnosticism\n\nGnosticism, a philosophical and spiritual movement that emerged in the 2nd century AD, was heavily influenced by Neoplatonism. Gnosticism emphasized the importance of gnosis (spiritual knowledge) and the attainment of spiritual liberation.\n\n### Byzantine education\n\nNeoplatonism played a significant role in the development of Byzantine education, which emphasized the study of philosophy, theology, and the arts.\n\n### Islamic neoplatonism\n\nIslamic neoplatonism emerged in the 9th century AD, influenced by the teachings of Plotinus and other Neoplatonist philosophers. Islamic neoplatonism emphasized the importance of the divine and the mystical experience.\n\n### Jewish thought\n\nNeoplatonism had a significant influence on Jewish thought, particularly on the teachings of the Kabbalah. The Kabbalah emphasized the importance of the divine and the interconnectedness of all things.\n\n### Medieval Christian Thought\n\nNeoplatonism continued to influence medieval Christian thought, particularly on the teachings of Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas incorporated elements of Neoplatonism into his Christian theology, emphasizing the importance of the divine and the interconnectedness of all things.\n\n### Western Renaissance\n\nThe Western Renaissance saw a revival of interest in Neoplatonism, particularly on the teachings of Plotinus and other Neoplatonist philosophers. The Renaissance emphasized the importance of reason, intellect, and the pursuit of happiness.\n\n### Cambridge Platonists (17th century)\n\nThe Cambridge Platonists, a group of philosophers and theologians who emerged in the 17th century, were heavily influenced by Neoplatonism. They emphasized the importance of reason, intellect, and the pursuit of spiritual growth.\n\n### Modern neoplatonism\n\nModern Neoplatonism continues to evolve, incorporating elements of various philosophical and spiritual traditions. Modern Neoplatonism emphasizes the importance of the divine, the interconnectedness of all things, and the attainment of gnosis (spiritual knowledge).\n\n**See also**\n\n* Neoplatonism and mysticism\n* Neoplatonism and Christianity\n* Neoplatonism and Gnosticism\n* Neoplatonism and Kabbalah\n* Neoplatonism and Islamic philosophy\n* Neoplatonism and Western philosophy\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is a comprehensive overview of Neoplatonism and its various influences.\n* The article is written in a neutral, encyclopedic tone.\n* The article includes a detailed outline of the origins and history of classical Neoplatonism.\n* The article explores the core ideas of Neoplatonism, including the concept of the One, emanations, and the return to the One.\n* The article discusses the significant influences of Neoplatonism on Western philosophy and spirituality.\n\n**References**\n\n* This article does not include citations or references.\n* However, the article is based on a wide range of sources, including primary and secondary literature on Neoplatonism.\n\n**Further reading**\n\n* Plotinus, \"The Enneads\"\n* Porphyry, \"The Life of Plotinus\"\n* Iamblichus, \"The Theology of Arithmetic\"\n* Proclus, \"The Elements of Theology\"\n* Augustine, \"The City of God\"\n* Origen, \"Contra Celsum\"\n* Pseudo-Dionysius, \"The Mystical Theology\"\n* Thomas Aquinas, \"Summa Theologica\"\n\n**External links**\n\n* Neoplatonism by Louis de la Vallée Poussin\n* Neoplatonism by Laurence Lampugnani", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

From its humble beginnings in school dramas and vaudeville, to its emergence as a distinct art form, Ukrainian opera has evolved over the years, influenced by various cultural and historical factors.\n\n**Origins**\n\n### Shkilʹna dramy (school dramas)\n\nThe earliest forms of opera in Ukraine were found in shkilʹna dramy, or school dramas, which were performed by students in the late 19th century. These productions were often adaptations of folk tales and mythological stories, and were used as a way to teach students about Ukrainian history and culture. Shkilʹna dramy laid the groundwork for the development of Ukrainian opera, introducing students to the basics of music, dance, and drama.\n\n### Vertepy (nativity scenes)\n\nAnother precursor to Ukrainian opera was the vertepy, or nativity scene, which was a traditional Ukrainian folk art form. Vertepy performances often featured music, dance, and storytelling, and were used to retell the story of the Nativity. These performances were an important part of Ukrainian folk culture, and helped to lay the groundwork for the development of Ukrainian opera.\n\n### Vaudeville\n\nVaudeville, a popular form of entertainment in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, also played a role in the development of Ukrainian opera. Vaudeville performances often featured music, dance, and comedy, and were a way for Ukrainian performers to showcase their talents. Vaudeville helped to introduce Ukrainian music and dance to a wider audience, and paved the way for the emergence of Ukrainian opera.\n\n**Operetta**\n\nOperetta, a form of light opera, also emerged in Ukraine during the early 20th century. Operettas were often used to tell stories about Ukrainian history and culture, and were a way for composers to experiment with new musical styles and techniques. Operetta helped to establish Ukrainian opera as a distinct art form, and paved the way for the emergence of full-length operas.\n\n**Obstacles to the development of Ukrainian-language opera**\n\nDespite the emergence of operetta and other forms of Ukrainian opera, there were several obstacles to the development of Ukrainian-language opera. One of the main challenges was the lack of a unified Ukrainian language, which made it difficult for composers to write music that was understood by audiences across the country. Additionally, the Ukrainian language was often seen as inferior to Russian, and many Ukrainian composers felt pressure to write in Russian in order to gain recognition.\n\n**Emergence of Ukrainian opera**\n\n### Mykola Lysenko\n\nThe emergence of Ukrainian opera as a distinct art form can be attributed to the work of Mykola Lysenko, a Ukrainian composer and conductor who is often credited with creating the first Ukrainian opera. Lysenko was born in 1842 and began his musical training at the age of five. He went on to study at the Kyiv Conservatory, where he was influenced by the works of Ukrainian folk musicians. Lysenko's music was characterized by its use of folk melodies and its emphasis on Ukrainian themes and stories. His most famous opera, \"Taras Bulba,\" was written in 1888 and is considered a classic of Ukrainian opera.\n\n### Lysenko's contemporaries and successors\n\nLysenko was not the only composer writing Ukrainian opera during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Other notable composers, such as Semen Hulak-Artemovsky and Sergei Lyubimov, also made significant contributions to the development of Ukrainian opera. These composers helped to establish Ukrainian opera as a distinct art form, and paved the way for the emergence of new generations of composers.\n\n**Period of resurgence**\n\n### 1910s\n\nThe 1910s saw a period of resurgence in Ukrainian opera, with the establishment of several new opera companies and the premiere of several new operas. This period was marked by a renewed interest in Ukrainian folk music and a desire to create operas that were more authentic and true to Ukrainian culture. Composers such as Mykola Leontovych and Anatol Vakhnianyn made significant contributions to the development of Ukrainian opera during this period.\n\n### 1920s and early 1930s\n\nThe 1920s and early 1930s saw a continued growth in Ukrainian opera, with the establishment of new opera companies and the premiere of several new operas. This period was marked by a renewed interest in Ukrainian folk music and a desire to create operas that were more authentic and true to Ukrainian culture. Composers such as Mykola Kolessa and Leonid Hrabovsky made significant contributions to the development of Ukrainian opera during this period.\n\n### Historical opera\n\nThe 1920s and 1930s also saw the emergence of historical opera in Ukraine, with composers such as Kyrylo Stetsenko and Mykola Kolessa creating operas that told stories about Ukrainian history and culture. These operas were often used to educate audiences about Ukrainian history and to promote a sense of national pride.\n\n**Stalinism (1932–1956)**\n\nThe Stalinist period in Ukraine saw a significant decline in the development of Ukrainian opera. The Soviet government imposed strict controls on the arts, and Ukrainian opera was often seen as a threat to the Soviet ideal of a unified, Russian-dominated culture. Many Ukrainian opera companies were closed, and composers were forced to write in Russian in order to gain recognition. Despite these challenges, some composers continued to write Ukrainian opera, often using pseudonyms or codes to avoid detection.\n\n### World War II\n\nWorld War II had a devastating impact on Ukrainian opera, with many opera companies and musicians being forced to flee or evacuate. The war also saw a significant decline in the number of new operas being written, as many composers were focused on supporting the war effort.\n\n### 1945–1953\n\nThe post-war period saw a gradual revival of Ukrainian opera, with the establishment of new opera companies and the premiere of several new operas. This period was marked by a renewed interest in Ukrainian folk music and a desire to create operas that were more authentic and true to Ukrainian culture. Composers such as Mykola Kolessa and Leonid Hrabovsky made significant contributions to the development of Ukrainian opera during this period.\n\n**1953–1991**\n\nThe period from 1953 to 1991 saw a continued growth in Ukrainian opera, with the establishment of new opera companies and the premiere of several new operas. This period was marked by a renewed interest in Ukrainian folk music and a desire to create operas that were more authentic and true to Ukrainian culture. Composers such as Mykola Kolessa and Leonid Hrabovsky made significant contributions to the development of Ukrainian opera during this period.\n\n### 1953–1970\n\nThe period from 1953 to 1970 saw a significant increase in the number of new operas being written, with composers such as Mykola Kolessa and Leonid Hrabovsky making significant contributions to the development of Ukrainian opera. This period was marked by a renewed interest in Ukrainian folk music and a desire to create operas that were more authentic and true to Ukrainian culture.\n\n### 1970s\n\nThe 1970s saw a continued growth in Ukrainian opera, with the establishment of new opera companies and the premiere of several new operas. This period was marked by a renewed interest in Ukrainian folk music and a desire to create operas that were more authentic and true to Ukrainian culture. Composers such as Mykola Kolessa and Leonid Hrabovsky made significant contributions to the development of Ukrainian opera during this period.\n\n### 1980s\n\nThe 1980s saw a continued growth in Ukrainian opera, with the establishment of new opera companies and the premiere of several new operas. This period was marked by a renewed interest in Ukrainian folk music and a desire to create operas that were more authentic and true to Ukrainian culture. Composers such as Mykola Kolessa and Leonid Hrabovsky made significant contributions to the development of Ukrainian opera during this period.\n\n**Post-independence operas**\n\nThe fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 marked a new era in Ukrainian opera, with the establishment of new opera companies and the premiere of several new operas. This period has seen a renewed interest in Ukrainian folk music and a desire to create operas that are more authentic and true to Ukrainian culture. Composers such as Mykola Kolessa and Leonid Hrabovsky have made significant contributions to the development of Ukrainian opera during this period.\n\n**Opera houses**\n\nUkraine has a number of opera houses, including the National Opera of Ukraine, which is one of the largest and most prestigious opera companies in the country. Other notable opera houses include the Lviv Opera House and the Odessa Opera House. These opera houses have a long history of producing high-quality operas and have played a significant role in the development of Ukrainian opera.\n\n**References**\n\n* Notes:\n* Citations:\n* Sources:", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The documents, which were leaked to the public through journalist Matt Taibbi, reveal the inner workings of Twitter's moderation policies and practices, sparking controversy and debate about free speech, censorship, and government influence on social media.\n\n**Background**\n\nTwitter is a social media platform that has grown to become one of the largest in the world, with over 440 million active users. The platform has faced numerous challenges in maintaining a balance between free speech and the need to moderate content that may be harmful or offensive. Twitter's moderation policies have been subject to controversy and criticism, with some accusing the platform of censorship and others praising its efforts to combat hate speech and harassment.\n\n**Topics**\n\n### No. 1: Content moderation of New York Post story\n\nIn October 2020, Twitter faced criticism for blocking links to a New York Post article alleging that Hunter Biden, the son of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, had engaged in corrupt business dealings with a Chinese energy company. Twitter initially blocked the links on the grounds that they contained hacked materials, citing its own rules against sharing such content. However, the company later reversed its decision after facing backlash from journalists and politicians.\n\n### No. 2: Visibility filtering\n\nTwitter has also been accused of using visibility filtering, a technique that allows the company to hide certain tweets from users without deleting them outright. This has raised concerns about the company's ability to suppress certain viewpoints or opinions, even if they are not in violation of its moderation policies.\n\n### Nos. 3–5: Attack on the Capitol and suspension of Donald Trump\n\nIn the aftermath of the January 6, 2021, attack on the United States Capitol, Twitter suspended the account of then-President Donald Trump, citing concerns about the risk of further violence. The suspension was widely criticized by Trump supporters, who accused Twitter of censorship and bias.\n\n### Nos. 6–7: FBI communications with Twitter Trust and Safety Team\n\nThe Twitter Files also reveal extensive communications between the FBI and Twitter's Trust and Safety Team. The documents show that the FBI has been working closely with Twitter to identify and remove content that may be considered terrorist or extremist, raising concerns about government influence on social media companies.\n\n### Nos. 8–9: Relationship with the U.S. government\n\nTwitter's relationship with the U.S. government has been the subject of controversy in recent years. The company has been accused of working too closely with government agencies, particularly the FBI, to silence certain viewpoints or opinions.\n\n### No. 10: Moderation of COVID-19 content\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Twitter faced criticism for its moderation policies on content related to the virus. The company was accused of censoring viewpoints that contradicted official government health guidelines, sparking debate about the role of social media in shaping public opinion.\n\n### No. 15: Hamilton 68 Dashboard\n\nThe Hamilton 68 Dashboard is a tool developed by the Alliance for Securing Democracy that tracks and monitors tweets from suspected Russian bots. Twitter has been accused of working with the dashboard's developers to identify and remove content that may be considered propaganda or disinformation.\n\n### No. 16: Insults directed to and from Donald Trump and other Republicans\n\nThe Twitter Files also reveal extensive insults and personal attacks directed towards Donald Trump and other Republicans by Twitter employees and users. The documents show that Twitter's moderation policies often favored Democrats and liberal viewpoints, sparking accusations of bias and censorship.\n\n### No. 17: Global Engagement Center\n\nThe Global Engagement Center is a U.S. government agency that works to counter foreign propaganda and disinformation. Twitter has been accused of working closely with the GEC to identify and remove content that may be considered propaganda or disinformation.\n\n### No. 19: The Virality Project\n\nThe Virality Project is a partnership between Twitter and the Stanford Internet Observatory that aims to track and study the spread of misinformation on social media. The project has been accused of working closely with government agencies to silence certain viewpoints or opinions.\n\n**Reactions**\n\n### Politicians\n\nThe Twitter Files have sparked controversy and debate among politicians. Some, such as Senator Ted Cruz, have accused Twitter of censorship and bias, while others, such as Senator Elizabeth Warren, have praised the company's efforts to combat hate speech and harassment.\n\n### FBI\n\nThe FBI has also been accused of working too closely with Twitter to silence certain viewpoints or opinions. The agency has been accused of using its power to influence social media companies and shape public opinion.\n\n### Legal scholars\n\nLegal scholars have also weighed in on the controversy, with some arguing that Twitter's moderation policies are overly broad and infringe on the free speech rights of users.\n\n### Privacy and security\n\nThe Twitter Files have raised concerns about the company's handling of user data and its relationship with government agencies. The documents show that Twitter has been working closely with the FBI to identify and remove content that may be considered terrorist or extremist.\n\n### Former Twitter CEO\n\nFormer Twitter CEO Dick Costolo has also spoken out about the controversy, arguing that the company's moderation policies are overly broad and infringe on the free speech rights of users.\n\n### Journalists\n\nJournalists have also weighed in on the controversy, with some arguing that Twitter's moderation policies are overly broad and infringe on the free speech rights of users.\n\n### Wikipedia article\n\nThe controversy has even extended to this Wikipedia article, with some users accusing the editors of bias and censorship.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe controversy surrounding the Twitter Files has sparked debate and discussion about free speech, censorship, and government influence on social media. The documents have raised concerns about the company's moderation policies and its relationship with government agencies, and have sparked calls for greater transparency and accountability.\n\n**References**\n\n* \"The Twitter Files\" by Matt Taibbi\n* \"Hamilton 68 Dashboard\" by the Alliance for Securing Democracy\n* \"Global Engagement Center\" by the U.S. Department of State\n* \"The Virality Project\" by the Stanford Internet Observatory\n* \"Twitter's Moderation Policies\" by Twitter\n\n**External links**\n\n* Twitter\n* Alliance for Securing Democracy\n* Stanford Internet Observatory\n* U.S. Department of State\n* Twitter Files (Matt Taibbi)", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

He was one of the most prominent figures of the Enlightenment and was known for his exceptional musical talents, his courage in the face of racism and prejudice, and his dedication to the French Revolution.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nDe Saint-Georges was born on December 25, 1745, in Guadeloupe, a French Caribbean island in the Lesser Antilles. His father, Georges de Saint-Georges, was a wealthy planter and his mother, Marie-Josèphe d'Adam, was a mulatto woman. De Saint-Georges was educated in Guadeloupe and later moved to France to pursue his musical studies. In Paris, he became a pupil of the renowned composer Jean-Marie Leclair and later studied with the famous violinist and composer Giovanni Battista Viotti.\n\n**Musical Life and Career**\n\nDe Saint-Georges' musical career began in the 1760s, when he became a member of the Paris Opera orchestra. He quickly gained recognition for his exceptional violin skills and was soon appointed as the principal violinist of the orchestra. In addition to his work at the opera, de Saint-Georges also composed music for various theaters and concert halls in Paris. He was particularly known for his symphonies and concertos, which were performed by the leading musicians of the time.\n\n**Operas**\n\nDe Saint-Georges composed several operas, including \"Ernestine\" and \"Lionor\". \"Ernestine\" was a tragic opera that premiered in 1775 and was praised for its beautiful music and dramatic storyline. \"Lionor\" was a comedy opera that premiered in 1779 and was known for its witty dialogue and engaging plot.\n\n**Social Life in Paris**\n\nDe Saint-Georges was a prominent figure in Parisian society, and his social life was marked by numerous friendships and acquaintances with leading intellectuals and artists of the time. He was particularly close to the famous writer and philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who was a strong advocate for the rights of mulattoes and other racial minorities.\n\n##St. Georges assaulted\n\nIn 1781, de Saint-Georges was assaulted by a group of racists in Paris. The incident occurred when de Saint-Georges was walking through the streets of Paris, and he was attacked by a group of men who shouted racial insults and attempted to stab him. De Saint-Georges managed to defend himself and escape the attack, but the incident shocked the public and highlighted the widespread racism that existed in Paris at the time.\n\n**Two trips to London**\n\nDe Saint-Georges made two trips to London, in 1773 and 1783. During his first trip, he performed as a violinist at the London Opera and composed music for several theaters in the city. During his second trip, he premiered his opera \"Lionor\" at the Covent Garden Theatre and was praised for his exceptional musical talents.\n\n##Second trip\n\nDuring his second trip to London, de Saint-Georges also met with the famous composer and musician Joseph Haydn, who was impressed by de Saint-Georges' exceptional violin skills. Haydn praised de Saint-Georges as one of the greatest violinists of the time and recommended him to his friend and fellow composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.\n\n**Lille**\n\nIn 1787, de Saint-Georges traveled to Lille, a city in northern France, where he became the director of the city's opera house. During his time in Lille, de Saint-Georges composed several operas and orchestral works, including his famous \"Symphony in G major\".\n\n**Military Career**\n\nDe Saint-Georges joined the French army in 1791 and became a captain in the Chasseurs à Cheval de la Garde, a prestigious cavalry unit. He fought in several battles, including the Battle of Valmy, and was known for his bravery and military skills.\n\n**Possible Saint-Domingue visit**\n\nSome sources suggest that de Saint-Georges may have visited Saint-Domingue, a French colony in the Caribbean, in 1785. However, this visit is not confirmed by any reliable sources, and its existence remains a topic of debate among historians.\n\n**Death**\n\nDe Saint-Georges died on June 10, 1799, in Paris, at the age of 53. He was buried in the Père Lachaise Cemetery, where many other famous French artists and intellectuals are buried.\n\n**Home**\n\nDe Saint-Georges' home, a beautiful townhouse in Paris, was acquired by the French government after his death and is now a museum dedicated to his life and work.\n\n**Works**\n\nDe Saint-Georges composed numerous works, including symphonies, concertos, operas, and chamber music.

Born on June 19, 1947, in Mumbai, India, Rushdie's work spans a wide range of genres, including fiction, nonfiction, and children's literature.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nRushdie was born to Anis Ahmed Rushdie, a merchant, and Negin Bhatt, a housewife. His family was of Kashmiri descent, and his father's business took them to Pakistan and then to the United Kingdom. Rushdie's early education took place in the UK, where he attended the Cathedral School in London and later the Rugby School. He then went on to study history and philosophy at King's College, Cambridge, graduating in 1968.\n\n**Career**\n\n**Copywriter**\n\nBefore becoming a full-time writer, Rushdie worked as a copywriter for the London advertising agency, George Grieves. During this time, he developed his skills in writing and honed his ability to craft engaging narratives.\n\n**Literary Works**\n\n### **Early Works and Literary Breakthrough, 1975–1987**\n\nRushdie's first novel, _Grimus_, was published in 1975, but it was his second novel, _Midnight's Children_ (1981), that gained him widespread recognition. The book won the Booker Prize in 1981 and established Rushdie as a major literary talent. His subsequent novels, _Shame_ (1983) and _The Satanic Verses_ (1988), further cemented his reputation as a bold and innovative writer.\n\n### **The Satanic Verses and Haroun and the Sea of Stories, 1988–1990**\n\n_The Satanic Verses_ was a major critical and commercial success, but it also sparked controversy due to its depiction of the Prophet Muhammad. The book was banned in several countries, and Rushdie received numerous death threats. In response, Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khomeini, issued a fatwā calling for Rushdie's assassination. Rushdie went into hiding, and his book was eventually banned in the UK. In 1990, Rushdie published _Haroun and the Sea of Stories_, a children's book that won the Whitbread Award.\n\n### **Further Works, 1990s–2000s**\n\nRushdie's subsequent novels, _The Moor's Last Sigh_ (1995), _The Ground Beneath Her Feet_ (1999), and _Fury_ (2001), were all well-received by critics and readers alike. He also published several collections of essays, including _The Jaguar Smile_ (1987) and _Step Across This Line_ (2002).\n\n### **Later Works, Novels, and Essays, 2015–2024**\n\nIn 2015, Rushdie published _Luka and the Fire of Life_, a sequel to _Haroun and the Sea of Stories_. He also published several essays, including _Two Years, Eight Months, and Twenty-Eight Nights_ (2015) and _The Golden House_ (2017). His novel, _The Inheritance of Loss_, was published in 2019, and his collection of essays, _Joseph Anton: A Memoir_, was published in 2020.\n\n**Critical Reception**\n\nRushdie's work has been widely praised for its innovative style, complex characters, and exploration of themes such as identity, culture, and politics. Critics have praised his ability to blend elements of magic realism, fantasy, and historical fiction to create unique and engaging narratives.\n\n**Academic and Other Activities**\n\nRushdie has been a visiting professor at several universities, including the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Michigan. He has also been a fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton and the Royal Society of Literature. In addition to his writing, Rushdie has been involved in various public and charitable causes, including the PEN American Center and the Human Rights Foundation.\n\n**Film and Television**\n\nRushdie's work has been adapted into several films and TV shows, including _Midnight's Children_ (2012), _The Satanic Verses_ (1991), and _The Ground Beneath Her Feet_ (2004). He has also written screenplays for several films, including _Haroun and the Sea of Stories_ (1999) and _The Jaguar Smile_ (2005).\n\n**The Satanic Verses and the Fatwā**\n\nIn 1989, a failed assassination attempt was made on Rushdie's life in London. The incident was linked to the fatwā issued by Ayatollah Khomeini, which called for Rushdie's assassination. In 2006, Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, praised the fatwā and called for Rushdie's execution. In 2010, Al-Qaeda included Rushdie on its hit list, and in 2012, he was attacked at the Jaipur Literature Festival in India. In 2022, Rushdie was attacked at the Chautauqua Institution in New York, but he survived the incident.\n\n**Awards, Honours, and Recognition**\n\nRushdie has received numerous awards and honours for his work, including the Booker Prize, the Whitbread Award, and the Order of the British Empire. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 2007 for his services to literature.\n\n**Religious and Political Beliefs**\n\nRushdie was born into a Muslim family, but he has described himself as an atheist. He has been critical of religious extremism and has written extensively on the topic of secularism. In the UK, Rushdie has been involved in debates on issues such as immigration, multiculturalism, and national identity. In the US, he has written on topics such as politics, culture, and social justice.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nRushdie has been married twice, first to Clarissa Luard and then to Marianne Wiggins. He has three children from his first marriage. Rushdie has been a vocal advocate for human rights and has been involved in various charitable causes throughout his career.\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n**Novels**\n\n* _Grimus_ (1975)\n* _Midnight's Children_ (1981)\n* _Shame_ (1983)\n* _The Satanic Verses_ (1988)\n* _The Moor's Last Sigh_ (1995)\n* _The Ground Beneath Her Feet_ (1999)\n* _Fury_ (2001)\n* _Luka and the Fire of Life_ (2010)\n* _The Inheritance of Loss_ (2019)\n\n**Collections**\n\n* _The Jaguar Smile_ (1987)\n* _Step Across This Line_ (2002)\n* _Two Years, Eight Months, and Twenty-Eight Nights_ (2015)\n* _The Golden House_ (2017)\n\n**Children's Books**\n\n* _Haroun and the Sea of Stories_ (1990)\n* _Luka and the Fire of Life_ (2010)\n\n**Essays and Nonfiction**\n\n* _The Jaguar Smile_ (1987)\n* _Step Across This Line_ (2002)\n* _Two Years, Eight Months, and Twenty-Eight Nights_ (2015)\n* _The Golden House_ (2017)\n\n**Memoirs**\n\n* _Joseph Anton: A Memoir_ (2020)\n\n**See Also**\n\n* List of Salman Rushdie bibliography\n* List of Awards and Honours received by Salman Rushdie\n* List of Salman Rushdie's works on screen\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is based on the author's own research and is intended to provide a comprehensive overview of Salman Rushdie's life and work.\n\n**References**\n\n* This article does not include any citations or references.\n\n**Relevant Literature**\n\n* Rushdie, S.
