Discovery**\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery is an American multinational mass media and entertainment conglomerate. It was formed in 2021 as a result of the merger between WarnerMedia and Discovery, Inc. The company operates as a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Entertainment, Inc. and is headquartered in Burbank, California.\n\n**Background**\n\n### 1923–1979\n\nThe Warner Bros. company was founded in 1923 by four brothers, Harry, Albert, Samuel, and Jack Warner. The brothers started their career in the film industry as a theater owners in Ohio, and later moved to Hollywood to establish themselves as movie producers. Warner Bros. quickly gained a reputation for producing high-quality films, and by the 1930s, they had become one of the major players in the American film industry.\n\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, Warner Bros. was a major producer of films, releasing classics such as \"The Jazz Singer\" (1927), \"The 39 Steps\" (1935), and \"Casablanca\" (1942). The company's success continued throughout the 1940s and 1950s, with films such as \"The Maltese Falcon\" (1941), \"The Big Sleep\" (1946), and \"Sunset Boulevard\" (1950).\n\n### 1979–1994\n\nIn 1979, Warner Communications, the parent company of Warner Bros., acquired the film library of MGM/UA Entertainment Company. This acquisition added a large number of classic films to the Warner Bros. library, including the \"James Bond\" series and the \"Rocky\" series.\n\nIn 1989, Warner Bros. was acquired by Time Inc., a media conglomerate owned by the Time Warner Company. Time Warner continued to operate Warner Bros. as a subsidiary, and the company continued to produce and distribute films and television shows.\n\n### 1996–2019\n\nIn 1996, Time Warner merged with Turner Broadcasting System (TBS) to form AOL Time Warner. The company was renamed WarnerMedia in 2001, and it continued to operate as a subsidiary of AOL Time Warner.\n\nIn 2008, Warner Bros. acquired New Line Cinema, a film studio that was known for producing films such as \"The Lord of the Rings\" trilogy and \"The Hangover\" series.\n\nIn 2018, AT&T acquired WarnerMedia, a subsidiary of Time Warner, in a deal worth $85.4 billion. The acquisition marked a significant shift in the media landscape, as AT&T became one of the largest media conglomerates in the world.\n\n**History**\n\n### Formation and beginning of operations (2021–2022)\n\nIn 2021, WarnerMedia and Discovery, Inc. announced a merger to form a new company, Warner Bros. Discovery. The merger was completed in April 2021, and the new company began operations.\n\nAs part of the merger, the company's leadership team was restructured, with David Zaslav, the CEO of Discovery, Inc., becoming the CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery. The company's headquarters was also relocated to Burbank, California.\n\nThe new company began its operations by integrating the assets of WarnerMedia and Discovery, Inc. The company's film and television libraries were combined, and a new management team was established to oversee the company's operations.\n\n### Turnover and cutbacks (2023–present)\n\nIn 2023, Warner Bros. Discovery announced a series of cost-cutting measures aimed at reducing its debt and improving its financial performance. The company announced that it would be laying off hundreds of employees and reducing its spending on content production.\n\nThe company also announced that it would be canceling several of its television shows, including \"Batwoman\" and \"Kung Fu\". The company stated that it would be focusing on producing more cost-effective content and reducing its reliance on expensive talent.\n\nThe company's decision to cut costs and reduce its spending on content production has been seen as a significant shift in the company's strategy. The company's focus on cost-cutting measures has been seen as a response to the changing media landscape and the need for companies to adapt to new market trends.\n\n**Assets**\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery owns a vast library of films and television shows, including:\n\n* The Warner Bros. film library, which includes classics such as \"The Wizard of Oz\" (1939), \"Casablanca\" (1942), and \"The Maltese Falcon\" (1941)\n* The HBO library, which includes hit shows such as \"Game of Thrones\" and \"The Sopranos\"\n* The Turner Broadcasting System (TBS) library, which includes shows such as \"The Simpsons\" and \"Family Guy\"\n* The Discovery Channel library, which includes shows such as \"Shark Week\" and \"Deadliest Catch\"\n\n**Leadership**\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery is led by David Zaslav, who serves as the company's CEO. Zaslav has been with the company since 2021, when he became the CEO of WarnerMedia after the merger with Discovery, Inc.\n\nThe company's leadership team also includes:\n\n* Ann Sarnoff, who serves as the company's chairwoman and CEO of Warner Bros. Pictures Group\n* Kim Masters, who serves as the company's president of Warner Bros.

Born on September 29, 1935, in Ferriday, Louisiana, Lewis is one of the most influential and iconic figures in the history of popular music. With a career spanning over six decades, Lewis has recorded numerous hits, including \"Great Balls of Fire,\" \"Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On,\" and \"Good Golly Miss Molly.\"\n\n**Early Life**\n\nJerry Lee Lewis was born to Elmo and Mamie Lewis in Ferriday, Louisiana. He was the youngest of four children, including brothers Jimmy and Linda. Lewis's early life was marked by poverty and hardship, with his family struggling to make ends meet during the Great Depression. Despite these challenges, Lewis's parents encouraged his love of music, and he began playing the piano at the age of four.\n\nLewis's earliest musical influences were gospel and country music. He grew up listening to the likes of Hank Williams and Elvis Presley, and he began performing in local talent shows and at church gatherings. Lewis's parents instilled in him a strong work ethic, and he began working odd jobs to help support his family from a young age.\n\n**Career**\n\n### J&M Studio\n\nIn 1956, Lewis recorded his first single, \"Crazy Arms,\" at J&M Studio in Jackson, Mississippi. The single failed to gain much traction, but it caught the attention of a local record label owner, Sam Phillips. Phillips was impressed by Lewis's raw talent and energy, and he invited him to record at Sun Records in Memphis, Tennessee.\n\n### Sun Records\n\nAt Sun Records, Lewis recorded some of his earliest hits, including \"End of the Road\" and \"You Win Again.\" Lewis's music was a unique blend of rock and roll, country, and gospel, and it quickly gained popularity in the Southern United States. Lewis's distinctive piano style, which featured rapid-fire arpeggios and a strong emphasis on rhythm, became a hallmark of his sound.\n\n### Marriage Controversy\n\nIn 1957, Lewis married his second cousin, Myra Gale Brown, who was just 13 years old at the time. The marriage sparked widespread controversy, with many of Lewis's fans and critics denouncing him for marrying a minor. The scandal led to a significant backlash against Lewis, and he was subsequently blacklisted by many radio stations and music industry executives.\n\n### Smash Records\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding his marriage, Lewis continued to record and perform. In 1962, he signed with Smash Records, a subsidiary of Mercury Records. With Smash Records, Lewis began to explore a more pop-oriented sound, releasing hits like \"I'm on Fire\" and \"It Hurts Me.\"\n\n### Live at the Star Club, Hamburg\n\nIn 1964, Lewis performed at the Star Club in Hamburg, Germany, alongside other notable rock and roll musicians like The Beatles and The Rolling Stones. The performance was captured on film, and it remains one of the most iconic live performances of the 1960s.\n\n### Country Comeback\n\nIn the 1970s, Lewis began to explore country music more seriously, releasing albums like \"The Session\" and \"Southern Roots.\" His country sound was heavily influenced by the likes of Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings, and it helped to establish Lewis as a respected figure in the country music scene.\n\n### Grand Ole Opry Appearance\n\nIn 1984, Lewis became a member of the Grand Ole Opry, one of the most prestigious country music institutions in the United States. His induction marked a significant milestone in his career, and it helped to solidify his status as a country music legend.\n\n### The Session and Southern Roots\n\nLewis's 1973 album \"The Session\" was a country-rock collaboration with Larry Gatlin and the Gatlin Brothers. The album was a critical and commercial success, and it helped to establish Lewis as a major force in country music. His 1976 album \"Southern Roots\" was a more stripped-down, rootsy affair, featuring Lewis's signature piano sound and a more country-oriented approach.\n\n### Later Career\n\nThroughout the 1980s and 1990s, Lewis continued to tour and record, releasing albums like \"Last Man Standing\" and \"Young Blood.\" His music became less commercially successful, but he maintained a dedicated following and continued to perform to sold-out crowds.\n\n**Music Legacy**\n\n### Accolades\n\nJerry Lee Lewis has been recognized for his contributions to music with numerous awards and accolades. He has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the Country Music Hall of Fame, and the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame. He has also been awarded a Kennedy Center Honor and a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\n### Piano Style\n\nLewis's piano style is characterized by its unique blend of rock and roll, country, and gospel influences. His playing is marked by rapid-fire arpeggios, strong emphasis on rhythm, and a distinctive \" triple-time\" feel. Lewis's playing has been cited as an influence by numerous other musicians, including Elvis Presley and Bruce Springsteen.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\n### Relationships and Children\n\nLewis has been married five times, including his marriage to Myra Gale Brown, which sparked widespread controversy in 1957. He has seven children, including four sons and three daughters. Lewis's children have been involved in his music career in various ways, including his son Steve, who has toured with him as a drummer.\n\n### Religious Beliefs\n\nLewis has been open about his Christian faith, and has often incorporated gospel music into his performances. He has also been involved in various charitable endeavors, including the Jerry Lee Lewis Foundation, which supports music education and other causes.\n\n### Graceland Arrest\n\nIn 1988, Lewis was arrested at Graceland, Elvis Presley's former estate in Memphis, Tennessee, for allegedly carrying a concealed weapon. The incident sparked a media frenzy, with many outlets reporting on Lewis's run-in with the law.\n\n### Debt\n\nIn the 1990s, Lewis was forced to sell his Tennessee home to pay off debts. He has spoken publicly about the financial struggles he faced during this period, including a reported $60,000 tax debt.\n\n### Health and Death\n\nLewis has undergone numerous health scares over the years, including a heart attack in 1991 and a lung transplant in 2010. He has also struggled with dementia and other cognitive impairments. On October 28, 2022, Lewis passed away at the age of 87, surrounded by his family.\n\n**Selected Discography**\n\n### Compositions\n\nSome of Lewis's most notable compositions include:\n\n* \"Great Balls of Fire\"\n* \"Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On\"\n* \"Good Golly Miss Molly\"\n* \"I'm on Fire\"\n* \"It Hurts Me\"\n* \"Crazy Arms\"\n* \"End of the Road\"\n* \"You Win Again\"\n\n**References**\n\n* Sources cited:\n\n**Further Reading**\n\n* Lewis, Jerry Lee.

This article will explore the major conflicts and events that have shaped Canada's military history, from the pre-contact era to the present.\n\n**Warfare Pre-Contact**\n\nThe earliest recorded conflicts in Canada date back to the pre-contact era, when indigenous peoples engaged in battles and skirmishes over land, resources, and trade. The most well-known of these conflicts is the Iroquois-Wendat Wars, which took place in the region of present-day Ontario and Quebec between the 15th and 17th centuries.\n\nThe Iroquois Confederacy, made up of the Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, Seneca, and Tuscarora tribes, fought against the Wendat (also known as the Huron) people over control of the region's resources and trade routes.

The game was played on February 12, 2023, at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. It was the fifth time that the stadium had hosted the Super Bowl, and the third time in five years.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Host selection\n\nThe host city for Super Bowl LVII was selected on May 24, 2018, by the NFL's owners. The city of Kansas City, Missouri, was selected as the host city, but the game was later moved to State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The decision to move the game was made on December 9, 2021.\n\n### Calls for location change\n\nThere were several calls for the location of the game to be changed due to the pandemic. Some critics argued that the game should be played in a city with warmer weather, while others argued that the game should be played at a stadium with a larger capacity.

The event was organized by the World Curling Federation (WCF) and featured 13 teams from around the world competing for the title of world champion.\n\n**Qualification**\n\nThe qualification process for the 2022 World Men's Curling Championship involved several steps. The top six teams from the 2021 World Men's Curling Championship, held in Basel, Switzerland, qualified automatically. The next four teams were determined through a series of qualification events held in the months leading up to the championship.\n\n**Russian Participation**\n\nDue to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, the Russian team was not allowed to participate in the championship. This decision was made by the WCF in consultation with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the International Paralympic Committee (IPC).\n\n**Teams**\n\nThe 13 teams competing in the 2022 World Men's Curling Championship were:\n\n1.  Canada (Glen Howard, skip)\n2.  Switzerland (Peter de Cruz, skip)\n3.  Scotland (Bruce Mouat, skip)\n4.  Denmark (Rasmus Stjerne, skip)\n5.  United States (John Shuster, skip)\n6.

Italy (Joel Retornaz, skip)\n12.  Sweden (Erik Stenberg, skip)\n13.  Australia (Dean Hewitt, skip)\n\n**Rule Changes**\n\nFor the 2022 World Men's Curling Championship, the WCF introduced several rule changes aimed at improving the game. One of the most notable changes was the introduction of a new shot clock, which limited teams to 60 seconds to complete each shot. This change was designed to increase the pace of play and reduce the time taken between shots.\n\nAnother change introduced by the WCF was the use of electronic scoreboards. These boards displayed real-time scores, shot counts, and other information, making it easier for spectators to follow the game.\n\n**Round-robin standings**\n\nThe round-robin standings for the 2022

The election was the first to be held after the country's 2019 general election, and it marked a significant shift in the country's political landscape.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Löfven's government\n\nThe election was the consequence of a tumultuous period for the Swedish government. The Swedish Social Democratic Party (SAP), led by Prime Minister Stefan Löfven, had formed a minority government after the 2019 general election. The government relied on the support of the Green Party (MP) and the Centre Party (C) to pass legislation. However, the government's popularity had declined significantly since the election, and Löfven had announced his intention to step down as party leader and prime minister in 2021.\n\n### Andersson's government\n\nIn January 2021, Magdalena Andersson was elected as the new leader of the SAP, making her the first female Prime Minister of Sweden. Andersson's government was formed after the 2022 general election, with the SAP and the Green Party in a minority government.\n\n**Electoral system**\n\nThe 2022 Swedish general election used the same electoral system as the previous election. The country was divided into 29 constituencies, each electing between 26 and 42 representatives to the Riksdag. The electoral system is a combination of proportional representation and one-seat constituencies. Voters had the option to vote for a party or an individual candidate.\n\n### Political parties\n\nA total of 28 parties contested the election, although not all of them were represented in the Riksdag.

He has been a prominent figure in Sri Lankan politics for over four decades, serving as Prime Minister on five separate occasions and holding various other positions, including Leader of the Opposition and Minister of Finance.\n\nEarly life and education\n\nRanil Wickremesinghe was born on March 24, 1949, in Colombo, Sri Lanka. His father, Esmond Wickremesinghe, was a Ministry of Finance official, and his mother, Mervyn Wickremesinghe, was a teacher. Wickremesinghe's family was of British Ceylonese ancestry, with his great-grandfather, David Wickremesinghe, being a British planter. He attended Royal College, Colombo, where he excelled in various subjects, including economics, politics, and history. Wickremesinghe went on to study economics at the University of Ceylon and later pursued a Master's degree in economics from the same institution.\n\nPolitical career\n\nWickremesinghe's entry into politics began in the 1970s, when he was a student leader at the University of Ceylon. He joined the United National Party (UNP) in 1970 and quickly rose through the ranks, becoming a member of parliament in 1977. In 1989, Wickremesinghe was appointed as the Minister of Youth Affairs and Employment, a position he held until 1991.\n\nBatalanda incident\n\nIn 1990, Wickremesinghe was involved in a controversy known as the Batalanda incident, which took place at a detention camp in Batalanda, Sri Lanka. The camp was alleged to be a torture center where opposition politicians, including Wickremesinghe, were detained and subjected to physical and psychological torture. Wickremesinghe denied any involvement in the alleged torture, but the incident remains a contentious issue in Sri Lankan politics.\n\nFirst premiership (1993-1994)\n\nWickremesinghe's first stint as Prime Minister began in 1993, when he was appointed by President Dingiri Banda Wijetunga. However, his premiership was cut short when he was defeated in the 1994 general election by the People's Alliance (PA) led by Chandrika Kumaratunga. Wickremesinghe's UNP party won only 16 seats in the election, compared to the PA's 106 seats.\n\nOpposition (1994-2001)\n\nAfter his defeat in the 1994 general election, Wickremesinghe became the Leader of the Opposition, a position he held until 2001. During this period, he was a vocal critic of the Kumaratunga government, opposing several of its policies, including the privatization of state-owned enterprises and the introduction of a new constitution.\n\n1999 presidential election\n\nIn 1999, Wickremesinghe ran for president as the UNP's candidate but lost to Kumaratunga, who was re-elected with a significant majority.\n\nSecond premiership (2001-2004)\n\nWickremesinghe's second stint as Prime Minister began in 2001, when he was appointed by President Chandrika Kumaratunga. During this period, he was instrumental in negotiating peace talks with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), a separatist group that had been waging a civil war in Sri Lanka since the 1980s. The peace talks resulted in the signing of the Ceasefire Agreement in 2002, which brought an end to hostilities between the government and the LTTE.\n\nPeace talks\n\nWickremesinghe played a key role in the peace talks, which were mediated by the Norwegian government. He was a strong advocate for a federal solution to the ethnic conflict, which he believed would address the grievances of the Tamil minority and bring an end to the conflict.\n\nOpposition (2004-2015)\n\nAfter his defeat in the 2004 general election, Wickremesinghe became the Leader of the Opposition once again. During this period, he was a vocal critic of the Mahinda Rajapaksa government, which was accused of human rights abuses and corruption.\n\n2005 presidential election\n\nIn 2005, Wickremesinghe ran for president again but lost to Rajapaksa, who was elected with a significant majority.\n\nDissent within the UNP\n\nIn 2014, Wickremesinghe was embroiled in a controversy within the UNP, when some of his colleagues accused him of being a \"dictator\" and trying to undermine the party's leadership. The incident led to a rift within the party, with some members calling for Wickremesinghe's resignation as Leader of the Opposition.\n\nEnd of the civil war and 2010 presidential election\n\nIn 2009, Wickremesinghe was a strong critic of the government's handling of the final stage of the civil war, which resulted in the defeat of the LTTE and the death of thousands of civilians. In the 2010 presidential election, Wickremesinghe ran for president once again but lost to Mahinda Rajapaksa, who was re-elected with a significant majority.\n\nThird, fourth and fifth premierships (2015-2019)\n\nWickremesinghe became Prime Minister for the third time in 2015, when he was appointed by President Maithripala Sirisena. During this period, he played a key role in negotiating a new constitution for Sri Lanka, which was approved by the people in a national referendum in 2019. However, his premiership was cut short when he was ousted by President Sirisena in 2018, following a constitutional crisis.\n\nForeign policy\n\nWickremesinghe has been a strong advocate for a more independent foreign policy for Sri Lanka, which he believes will help the country to maintain its sovereignty and avoid being drawn into regional conflicts.\n\nGovernment bonds controversy\n\nIn 2015, Wickremesinghe's government was embroiled in a controversy over the sale of government bonds, which raised questions about corruption and financial mismanagement. The incident led to a loss of confidence in the government and a decline in the value of the rupee.\n\nOpposition (2019-2022)\n\nAfter his ouster in 2018, Wickremesinghe became the Leader of the Opposition once again. During this period, he was a vocal critic of the Gotabaya Rajapaksa government, which was accused of human rights abuses and corruption.\n\nSixth premiership (2022)\n\nIn 2022, Wickremesinghe became Prime Minister for the sixth time, when he was appointed by President Ranil Wickremesinghe (who is his nephew). During this period, he has been focused on addressing the economic crisis in Sri Lanka, which has been caused by a combination of factors, including a decline in tourism and a shortage of foreign exchange.\n\nPresidency (2022-present)\n\nIn July 2022, Wickremesinghe won the presidential election, becoming the 8th President of Sri Lanka. He has been focused on addressing the economic crisis and implementing policies to promote economic growth and stability.\n\nCrackdown on anti-government protests\n\nIn 2022, Wickremesinghe's government was criticized for its handling of anti-government protests, which were sparked by the economic crisis. The government was accused of using excessive force against protesters, resulting in the death of several people.\n\nHandling of economic crisis\n\nWickremesinghe's government has been focused on addressing the economic crisis, which has been caused by a combination of factors, including a decline in tourism and a shortage of foreign exchange. He has implemented policies to promote economic growth and stability, including the introduction of a new economic plan and the sale of state-owned enterprises.\n\n2023 local government elections\n\nIn 2023, Wickremesinghe's government was criticized for its handling of local government elections, which were marred by allegations of voter suppression and irregularities.

Lahaina is the third-oldest town in Hawaii, after Kailua-Kona and Honolulu, and is known for its rich history, cultural significance, and natural beauty.\n\n## History\n\n### Name\n\nThe modern name \"Lahaina\" is derived from the Hawaiian language, where \"Lahaina\" means \"cruel\" or \"cruel land.\" However, the town's original name was \"Lele\", which was given to it by the ancient Hawaiians.\n\n### Ancient Names\n\nThe town was also known as \"Kaanapali\" in ancient times, which was the name of a nearby valley.\n\n### Early Rulers\n\nThe area now known as Lahaina was first settled by ancient Hawaiians around 1200 AD. The town was part of the Kalaniʻōpuʻu Province, which was ruled by King Kalaniʻōpuʻu, a powerful and influential ruler of ancient Hawaii.\n\n### Western Contact\n\n#### Kahekili II\n\nIn 1782, King Kahekili II, a powerful and respected ruler of Maui, welcomed the arrival of British explorer Captain William Brown, who had landed in Maui with a group of sailors and traders. This marked the beginning of Western contact with the Hawaiian Islands.\n\n#### Kamehameha I and Kamehameha II\n\nIn 1790, King Kamehameha I, who would eventually unify the islands under one rule, arrived in Lahaina with a large army to conquer the island of Maui. After a brief battle, Kamehameha I defeated the forces of King Kahekili II, and Lahaina became part of the Kingdom of Hawaii.\n\nKing Kamehameha II, who succeeded his father, expanded the kingdom and established Lahaina as a major commercial center.\n\n#### Christian Missionaries\n\nIn 1820, the first Christian missionaries arrived in Lahaina, led by Rev. Hiram Bingham, who would later become the first president of Yale University. The missionaries introduced Christianity to the islands and established the first schools, churches, and hospitals in Lahaina.\n\n#### Whaling\n\nIn the 19th century, Lahaina became a major whaling port, with many whaling ships arriving in the town to hunt and process whales. The whaling industry brought great wealth and prosperity to the town, but also led to the exploitation of the local population and the destruction of the natural environment.\n\n#### Kamehameha III\n\nKing Kamehameha III, who ruled from 1825 to 1854, established Lahaina as the capital of the Kingdom of Hawaii. During his reign, the town experienced significant growth and development, with the construction of new buildings, roads, and infrastructure.\n\n#### 20th Century\n\nIn the 20th century, Lahaina underwent significant changes, including the decline of the whaling industry, the rise of tourism, and the transfer of the capital to Honolulu. The town was also affected by the construction of a new highway, which bypassed the town and reduced its economic viability.\n\n### 2023 Wildfire\n\nIn 2023, a devastating wildfire swept through Lahaina, destroying many homes and businesses. The fire was caused by strong winds and dry conditions, and was exacerbated by the town's proximity to the ocean and the surrounding hills.\n\n## Geography\n\nLahaina is located on the northwest coast of Maui, approximately 35 miles northwest of Honolulu. The town is situated on a narrow strip of land between the ocean and the surrounding hills, which provide a natural barrier against the wind and the sea.\n\n### Climate\n\nLahaina has a tropical climate, with high temperatures and high humidity throughout the year. The town experiences a wet season from November to March, with frequent rain showers and strong winds. The dry season, which runs from April to October, is characterized by clear skies and gentle breezes.\n\n## Demographics\n\nAs of the 2020 census, the population of Lahaina was approximately 9,301 people. The town has a diverse population, with a mix of Native Hawaiians, Caucasians, Asians, and other ethnic groups.\n\n## Arts and Culture\n\nLahaina is known for its rich cultural heritage, which reflects the town's history and the traditions of the indigenous people. The town is home to many museums, galleries, and cultural centers, which showcase the art, music, and dance of Hawaii.\n\n## Sports\n\nLahaina is a popular destination for water sports, including surfing, snorkeling, and whale watching. The town is also home to several golf courses, tennis courts, and other sports facilities.\n\n## Popular Culture\n\nLahaina has been featured in several films and television shows, including the popular TV series \"Hawaii Five-0,\" which was set in Honolulu but filmed in Lahaina. The town has also been the subject of numerous books, articles, and documentaries, which explore its history, culture, and natural beauty.\n\n## Gallery\n\n* Image of Lahaina town\n* Image of the Lahaina Harbor\n* Image of the Lahaina Lighthouse\n* Image of the Old Lahaina Luau\n* Image of the Banyan Tree Park\n\n## See Also\n\n* List of cities and towns in Hawaii\n* History of Hawaii\n* Culture of Hawaii\n* Geography of Hawaii\n\n## Notes\n\n* This article is a general overview of the town of Lahaina, Hawaii, and is intended to provide a brief introduction to its history, culture, and natural beauty.\n* The article is based on publicly available information and is not intended to be a comprehensive or definitive history of the town.\n* The article is written in a neutral and encyclopedic tone, and is intended to provide a factual and informative account of the town and its history.\n\n## References\n\n* This article does not contain any citations or references.\n\n## External Links\n\n* Official website of the Town of Lahaina\n* Lahaina Visitor Center\n* Lahaina Heritage Trail\n* Lahaina Cultural and Historical Preservation Society", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The election was the 15th general election in the country's history and was held under the First-Past-The-Post (FPTP) electoral system.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Previous election\n\nThe previous general election was held in 2018, where the Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition, led by Mahathir Mohamad, won a majority of the parliamentary seats, ending the 61-year rule of the Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition. However, the PH government collapsed in February 2020, following a leadership crisis and the resignation of Mahathir as Prime Minister.\n\n### Significant events\n\nThe 2022 general election was preceded by a series of significant events, including the COVID-19 pandemic, which had a major impact on the country's economy and society. The pandemic also led to the implementation of various restrictions and lockdowns, which had a significant impact on the campaigning process.\n\n### 2020–22 political crisis\n\nIn 2020, the PH government collapsed following a leadership crisis and the resignation of Mahathir as Prime Minister. The subsequent snap election in 2020 resulted in the BN coalition regaining power, with Ismail Sabri Yaakob becoming the Prime Minister. However, the government's performance was marred by controversy and criticism, leading to growing calls for a fresh general election.\n\n**Electoral system**\n\nThe 2022 general election was held under the First-Past-The-Post (FPTP) electoral system, where the candidate with the most votes in each constituency wins the seat. The election was contested by 33 parties, including the main opposition coalition, Perikatan Nasional (PN), and the incumbent government coalition, BN.\n\n**Timeline**\n\n### Dissolution of parliament\n\nThe Dewan Rakyat, the lower house of parliament, was dissolved on 10 October 2022, by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, following a request by the Prime Minister, Ismail Sabri Yaakob.\n\n### Dissolution of state legislatures\n\nThe state legislative assemblies were also dissolved on the same day, paving the way for the general election.\n\n### Pre-nomination events\n\nIn the lead-up to the election, various parties and candidates announced their intention to contest the election. The BN coalition, led by Ismail Sabri Yaakob, announced its list of candidates, while the PN coalition, led by Muhyiddin Yassin, also announced its list of candidates.\n\n### Timetable\n\nThe election was held on 19 November 2022, with polling stations opening at 8 am and closing at 5 pm.

The election was the third since the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came to power in the state in 2008. The election saw a fierce contest between the BJP, the Indian National Congress (INC), and the Janata Dal (Secular) (JD(S)), as well as several other parties.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Political Developments\n\nThe 2023 Karnataka Legislative Assembly election was the culmination of a series of political developments in the state. In the run-up to the election, several high-profile defections took place, with several Congress and JD(S) MLAs switching sides to join the BJP.

From the early settlements to the present day, the city of Quebec has undergone numerous transformations, shaped by the interactions of its indigenous peoples, French colonizers, and British rulers.\n\nIntroduction\n------------\n\nQuebec, the largest city in the province of Quebec, Canada, has a unique history that reflects the country's colonial past and its struggle for independence. The city's strategic location on the Saint Lawrence River made it an attractive spot for trade and commerce, attracting European settlers and indigenous peoples alike. Over time, Quebec evolved into a thriving metropolis, with a rich cultural heritage and a strong sense of community.\n\n### 1599\n\nThe history of Quebec began in 1599, when Samuel de Champlain, a French explorer, arrived at the site of the present-day city. Champlain, who would later become the founder of the city, was on a mission to explore the Saint Lawrence River and establish a French presence in the region. He was followed by other French colonizers, who established a series of trading posts and settlements along the river.\n\n### 1608\n\nIn 1608, Champlain returned to Quebec and established a permanent settlement, which he named Quebec after the Algonquin word \"Kebec,\" meaning \"narrow passage.\" The settlement quickly grew into a thriving community, attracting merchants, traders, and missionaries. The city's strategic location made it an important hub for trade and commerce, with goods flowing in and out of the city from all over the world.\n\n### 1634\n\nIn 1634, the French Crown granted Quebec a royal charter, giving the city the right to govern itself and collect taxes. This marked the beginning of Quebec's municipal history, as the city began to develop its own system of government and administration. The charter also established the city's boundaries, which would remain largely unchanged for centuries to come.\n\n### 1642\n\nIn 1642, the British Crown captured Quebec from the French, and the city remained under British rule for the next 100 years. During this time, the city's economy and population grew rapidly, as the British established a series of trading posts and settlements along the Saint Lawrence River.\n\n### 1793\n\nIn 1793, the French Revolution reached Quebec, and the city's residents rose up against their British rulers. The rebellion, which was led by the French-speaking population, was ultimately unsuccessful, and the city remained under British rule.\n\n19th Century\n------------\n\nThe 19th century was a time of significant change and growth for Quebec.
