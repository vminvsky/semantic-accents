The conflict has resulted in significant human and economic costs, and has had far-reaching implications for international relations.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Post-Soviet Relations\n\nThe relationship between Ukraine and Russia has been complex and often tense since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. Ukraine gained independence and became a sovereign state, while Russia maintained a significant influence over the region. The two countries have had several disputes over issues such as border demarcation, energy transit fees, and Crimea's status.\n\n### Ukrainian Revolution, Russian Intervention in Crimea and Donbas\n\nIn 2013, Ukraine experienced a wave of protests, known as the Euromaidan movement, which aimed to bring the country closer to the European Union and distance itself from Russia. The protests led to the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych, who had been close to Russia. Russia responded by annexing Crimea in March 2014, following a disputed referendum. The annexation was widely condemned by the international community. In the same year, Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine's Donbas region launched a rebellion, which has continued to this day.\n\n**Prelude**\n\n### Putin's Invasion Announcement\n\nOn 21 February 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that he would be recognizing the independence of the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics in eastern Ukraine. This move was widely seen as a precursor to a full-scale invasion. On 22 February, the Russian parliament approved the deployment of troops to Ukraine. The invasion began the following day.\n\n**Events**\n\n### Initial Invasion (24 February – 7 April)\n\nThe initial invasion saw Russian forces launch a multi-directional assault on Ukraine.

The dispute arose after the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) decided to send a team of athletes selected by the National Sports Federations (NSFs) rather than the IOA itself. The IOA's decision was seen as a breach of the IOA's own constitution, which requires the IOA to select the Indian team for international competitions. As a result, the CGF threatened to withdraw India's membership and ban the country from participating in the Commonwealth Games. However, the dispute was eventually resolved, and India was allowed to participate in the games.\n\n**Competitors**\n\nA total of 224 Indian athletes competed in the 2022 Commonwealth Games, across 16 sports.

The Fabelmans premiered at the Telluride Film Festival on September 1, 2022, and was released in theaters on November 11, 2022.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film follows the story of Sammy Fabelman (played by Gabriel LaBelle), a 12-year-old boy who lives with his mother, Mitzi (played by Michelle Williams), and his father, Burt (played by Paul Dano), in Phoenix, Arizona, in the late 1960s.

Born in Gijón, Asturias, Spain, Torres Quevedo is considered one of the most prominent figures in the history of Spanish technology and engineering.\n\nEarly Life and Education\n\nTorres Quevedo was born in Gijón, a city in the autonomous community of Asturias, Spain. His father, Juan Torres, was a merchant, and his mother, María Quevedo, was a homemaker. Torres Quevedo was the eldest of four children, and his family's economic situation allowed him to pursue his interest in science and mathematics from an early age. He studied at the University of Oviedo, where he graduated with a degree in mathematics and physics in 1873.\n\nCareer\n\nTorres Quevedo's career spanned multiple fields, and he is best known for his contributions to cableways, analogue calculating machines, and radio control.\n\nCableways\n----------------\n\nTorres Quevedo's work on cableways began in the late 19th century, when he was commissioned by the Spanish government to design a system for crossing the Strait of Gibraltar. His design, known as the \"Teleférico,\" used a series of cables and pulleys to transport passengers and cargo across the strait. Although the project was never completed, it laid the foundation for Torres Quevedo's future work on cableways.\n\nAnalogue Calculating Machines\n------------------------------\n\nTorres Quevedo was one of the pioneers of analogue calculating machines, which were used to solve mathematical problems using mechanical or electrical means. In the early 20th century, he designed a series of machines, including the \"Torres Quevedo Calculating Machine,\" which used a system of gears and levers to perform arithmetic operations. These machines were widely used in academic and industrial settings, and Torres Quevedo's designs influenced the development of modern electronic calculators.\n\nAerostatics\n------------\n\nTorres Quevedo's work on aerostatics, the study of the behavior of gases in the atmosphere, led to significant advancements in the field of aeronautics. He designed a series of experiments to study the aerodynamics of aircraft, including the use of wind tunnels and model aircraft. His work laid the foundation for the development of modern aerodynamics and helped to improve the design of aircraft.\n\nRadio Control: the Telekino\n---------------------------\n\nIn the early 20th century, Torres Quevedo became interested in radio control, and he designed a system called the \"Telekino,\" which used radio waves to control a model boat. The Telekino was a significant innovation in the field of remote control, and it paved the way for the development of modern radio control systems.\n\nFormal Language\n----------------\n\nTorres Quevedo was also interested in formal language, and he developed a system for representing mathematical and scientific concepts using a formal language. His work in this area was influential in the development of modern computer science and artificial intelligence.\n\nLaboratory of Automation\n-------------------------\n\nIn the 1920s, Torres Quevedo founded the Laboratory of Automation, a research center dedicated to the study of automation and robotics. The laboratory was a hub for innovation and experimentation, and it attracted some of the leading minds in the field of automation.\n\nChess Automaton: El Ajedrecista\n-------------------------------\n\nOne of Torres Quevedo's most famous inventions was a chess automaton called \"El Ajedrecista,\" which was designed to play chess against humans. The automaton used a complex system of gears and levers to move the pieces on the board, and it was capable of playing a game of chess in under an hour. El Ajedrecista was a significant innovation in the field of artificial intelligence, and it laid the foundation for the development of modern chess-playing computers.\n\nEssays on Automatics\n---------------------\n\nTorres Quevedo wrote several essays on automation, including \"Essays on Automatics,\" which explored the possibilities and limitations of automation. His work in this area was influential in shaping the field of automation and robotics.\n\nAnalytical Machines\n------------------\n\nTorres Quevedo's work on analytical machines, which were used to solve mathematical problems using mechanical or electrical means, was a significant contribution to the field of computer science. His designs for analytical machines were influential in the development of modern electronic computers.\n\nNaval Projects\n----------------\n\nTorres Quevedo was involved in several naval projects, including the design of a submarine and a series of experiments to study the behavior of ships in the ocean. His work in this area was influential in the development of modern naval architecture.\n\nOther Inventions and Miscellaneous Activities\n----------------------------------------------\n\nTorres Quevedo was a prolific inventor, and his work extended beyond the fields of cableways, analogue calculating machines, and radio control. He was also interested in Esperanto, a constructed language designed to be a universal second language, and he wrote a series of articles on the subject.\n\nEsperantist\n------------\n\nTorres Quevedo was an Esperantist, and he believed in the potential of the language to unite people from different cultures and backgrounds. He wrote several articles on Esperanto and its potential applications.\n\nSpanish-American Technological Dictionary\n------------------------------------------\n\nTorres Quevedo also wrote a Spanish-American Technological Dictionary, which was a comprehensive guide to technical terms and concepts in Spanish and English. The dictionary was widely used in academic and industrial settings, and it helped to promote technical communication between Spanish and American speakers.\n\nDistinctions\n\nTorres Quevedo was recognized for his contributions to science and technology, and he received several awards and honors throughout his career. He was elected a member of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Spain and was awarded the Grand Cross of the Order of Charles III.\n\nPersonal Life, Religious Beliefs, and Death\n\nTorres Quevedo was married to Adela Marquez, and the couple had three children together. He was a devout Catholic and believed in the importance of faith in everyday life. Torres Quevedo died on December 18, 1936, at the age of 84, and was buried in the San Isidro cemetery in Madrid.\n\nLegacy\n\nTorres Quevedo's legacy extends beyond his contributions to science and technology. He was a pioneer in the field of automation and robotics, and his work laid the foundation for the development of modern computer science and artificial intelligence.

The monastery is situated on the site of the ancient Kyiv fortress and is one of the most revered and historic pilgrimage sites in Eastern Europe.\n\n**History**\n\n### Early years\n\nThe earliest written records of a monastery on the site date back to the 12th century, during the Kievan Rus' period. The original monastery was dedicated to the Archangel Michael and was a significant spiritual and cultural center in the region. Over the centuries, the monastery underwent numerous transformations, expansions, and reconstructions, reflecting the changing fortunes of the city and the empire.\n\n### 16th–17th centuries\n\nDuring the Cossack era, the monastery was rebuilt and expanded, with the addition of new churches and buildings. The Golden-Domed Cathedral, which would become the monastery's iconic centerpiece, was constructed in the mid-17th century. The cathedral's design was influenced by the Ukrainian Baroque style, with intricate stone carvings, ornate frescoes, and glittering golden domes.\n\n### 18th century\n\nIn the 18th century, the monastery underwent significant renovations, with the addition of new structures and the enhancement of existing ones. The refectory, a large hall used for communal meals and gatherings, was built during this period. The monastery also became a major center for education, with a renowned theological academy attracting scholars from across the region.\n\n### 19th century\n\nThe 19th century saw the monastery's continued growth and development, with the addition of new churches, chapels, and buildings. The monastery also became a major pilgrimage site, attracting visitors from across Eastern Europe. The Golden-Domed Cathedral underwent significant repairs and renovations, including the restoration of its original frescoes and the installation of new mosaics.\n\n### 20th century\n\nThe 20th century was marked by significant turmoil and upheaval for the monastery. During the Soviet era, the monastery was closed, and many of its buildings were converted into museums, storage facilities, and even a military barracks. The Golden-Domed Cathedral was severely damaged, with its golden domes removed and its interior stripped of its valuable artworks.\n\n### Demolition and aftermath\n\nIn the 1930s, the Soviet authorities ordered the demolition of the monastery, citing its \"reactionary\" and \"bourgeois\" origins. The Golden-Domed Cathedral was partially destroyed, and many of its valuable artworks were either removed or destroyed. The monastery's grounds were converted into a public park, and the site was largely forgotten.\n\n### Restoration\n\nIn the 1990s, the Ukrainian government began a major restoration project to revive the monastery and restore its original grandeur.

This phenomenon has occurred in various historical and contemporary contexts, with countries experiencing regime change, civil war, or other forms of political instability.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe concept of an embassy without a government raises complex questions about the nature of diplomatic recognition, state sovereignty, and international relations. In situations where a country's government is overthrown, collapses, or is otherwise unable to function, the question arises as to who should represent the country in diplomatic relations with other states. This article explores the history of embassies without a government, highlighting notable examples and the challenges they pose for international relations.\n\nHistory\n\nRussia (1917–1925)\n\n### Diplomatic missions after 1917\n\nFollowing the October Revolution of 1917, the Russian Provisional Government was overthrown, and the Bolsheviks established the Soviet government. As the new government consolidated power, the Russian Provisional Government's diplomatic missions were initially left in place, representing the country in the absence of a clear successor government. However, as the Soviet government solidified its control, these missions were gradually replaced by new diplomatic representatives of the Soviet state.\n\nThe transition from the Provisional Government to the Soviet government was marked by a period of confusion and competition between different factions vying for influence and control. This reflected the complex and often contradictory nature of the Russian Revolution, which saw both radical and moderate forces vying for power. As a result, the establishment of a new government and the reorganization of diplomatic missions were gradual processes, influenced by a range of factors, including the shifting balance of power within the Soviet government and the international context.\n\n### Dissolution of the Soviet Union\n\nThe collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 led to the dissolution of the Soviet government and the establishment of 15 new independent states. The Soviet Union's diplomatic missions were replaced by those of the newly independent states, marking the end of the Soviet government's diplomatic presence in the international arena. This process was accompanied by a significant reorganization of international relations, as the newly independent states established diplomatic relations with other countries and international organizations.\n\nSpain (1939–1977)\n\n### Diplomatic missions after 1939\n\nFollowing the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936, the government of the Second Spanish Republic was overthrown, and the Nationalist forces, led by General Francisco Franco, established a new government. As the Nationalist forces gained control of the country, the diplomatic missions of the Second Spanish Republic were closed, and new diplomatic representatives of the Franco regime were established.\n\nThe Nationalist victory marked the end of the Second Spanish Republic and the beginning of a long period of authoritarian rule under Franco. The establishment of a new government and the reorganization of diplomatic missions reflected the radical changes that took place in Spain during this period. The Franco regime's diplomatic missions were characterized by a strong emphasis on authoritarianism and nationalism, and they played an important role in promoting the regime's ideology and interests in the international arena.\n\nPoland (1939–1990)\n\n### Diplomatic missions after 1939\n\nFollowing the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union in 1939, the Polish government was overthrown, and the country was occupied by the two powers. As the Polish government-in-exile established a new government in London, the country's diplomatic missions were reorganized to reflect the changed circumstances.\n\nThe Polish government-in-exile played an important role in promoting Polish interests and coordinating resistance efforts during the occupation. However, the country's diplomatic missions were marked by a significant degree of instability and uncertainty, reflecting the complex and often contradictory nature of the Polish government's relationships with the Western Allies and the Soviet Union.\n\nAfghanistan (2021–present)\n\n### Diplomatic missions after 2021\n\nFollowing the collapse of the government of President Ashraf Ghani in August 2021, Afghanistan was plunged into a state of political instability and chaos. As the Taliban seized control of the country, the international community struggled to respond to the crisis, with many countries suspending diplomatic relations with the new government.\n\nThe situation in Afghanistan remains highly uncertain and volatile, with the Taliban facing significant internal and external challenges. The country's diplomatic missions are currently in a state of flux, with many countries still grappling with the implications of the Taliban's takeover and the future of international relations with Afghanistan.\n\nSee also\n\n* Diplomatic recognition\n* State sovereignty\n* International relations\n* Afghanistan conflict\n* Spanish Civil War\n* Soviet government\n* Polish government-in-exile\n\nNotes\n\n* The concept of an embassy without a government raises complex questions about the nature of diplomatic recognition, state sovereignty, and international relations.\n* The history of embassies without a government is marked by a range of different contexts and experiences, reflecting the complex and often contradictory nature of international relations.\n* The current situation in Afghanistan highlights the challenges and uncertainties that can arise when a country's government collapses or is overthrown, and the need for international coordination and cooperation in responding to such crises.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The company has gained significant attention in the cryptocurrency industry for its innovative products and aggressive marketing strategies. However, in November 2022, FTX faced a major crisis that led to its bankruptcy and widespread repercussions in the cryptocurrency market.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nFTX was founded in 2019 by Sam Bankman-Fried, a young and ambitious entrepreneur who became a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency industry. Bankman-Fried's vision for FTX was to create a derivatives exchange that would offer a wide range of products, including futures, options, and leveraged tokens. The company quickly gained popularity among cryptocurrency enthusiasts and institutional investors, who were attracted by its innovative products and competitive fees.\n\n**History**\n\nFTX was launched in May 2019, and it quickly gained traction in the cryptocurrency market. The company's founders, including Sam Bankman-Fried and Gary Wang, had a strong background in finance and technology, which enabled them to develop a robust and user-friendly platform. FTX's early success was fueled by its innovative products, including futures and options contracts, which allowed users to trade cryptocurrencies with leverage.\n\nIn 2020, FTX expanded its product offerings to include spot trading, which allowed users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies directly. The company also launched a suite of DeFi (Decentralized Finance) products, including lending and borrowing services. FTX's aggressive marketing strategies and partnerships with prominent cryptocurrency influencers helped to further boost its popularity.\n\n**November 2022 crisis and bankruptcy**\n\n### Background: FTX and Alameda, Binance, and CoinDesk report\n\nIn November 2022, FTX faced a major crisis that would ultimately lead to its bankruptcy. The crisis began on November 2, 2022, when CoinDesk reported that FTX's digital asset arm, Alameda Research, had invested heavily in FTT, the native token of FTX. The report suggested that FTT was not a stablecoin, as claimed by FTX, but rather a highly volatile token that had lost significant value in recent months.\n\nThe news sparked a sell-off in FTT, which led to a sharp decline in the token's price. FTX, which had invested heavily in FTT, faced a liquidity crisis as users began to withdraw their funds from the platform. The company's reputation was also severely damaged, as investors and users lost confidence in its ability to manage their assets.\n\n### Crisis begins: Binance FTT sale, sell-off, and withdrawn rescue bid\n\nOn November 6, 2022, Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, announced that it would sell its entire stake in FTT. The news sparked a sharp sell-off in FTT, which led to a further decline in the token's price. FTX's liquidity crisis deepened as users continued to withdraw their funds from the platform.\n\nIn a last-ditch effort to rescue the company, Binance offered to buy FTX for $4.5 billion. However, the deal fell through after Binance's due diligence revealed that FTX's financial situation was worse than initially thought. The company's assets were significantly undervalued, and its liabilities were much higher than reported.\n\n### Bankruptcy and unauthorized transactions\n\nOn November 11, 2022, FTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States. The company's assets were frozen, and its operations were suspended. An investigation by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) revealed that FTX had engaged in unauthorized transactions, including the use of customer funds for the benefit of its sister company, Alameda Research.\n\nThe SEC also found that FTX had failed to disclose the risks associated with its products, including its futures and options contracts. The company's CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, was accused of misusing customer funds and making false statements to investors.\n\n### Widening impact and contagion fears\n\nThe collapse of FTX sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency market, which was already reeling from a series of high-profile hacks and scams. The company's bankruptcy led to a sharp decline in the prices of many cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nThe contagion effect of FTX's bankruptcy was significant, as many other cryptocurrency firms and exchanges struggled to maintain their liquidity and stability. The market was plagued by a series of flash crashes and trading halts, which further exacerbated the crisis.\n\n### Responses and effects\n\n#### Effects on investors\n\nThe collapse of FTX had a devastating impact on its investors, who lost significant amounts of money due to the company's bankruptcy. Many investors had invested heavily in FTX's native token, FTT, which had lost nearly all of its value.\n\nThe crisis also had a significant impact on other cryptocurrency investors, who lost confidence in the industry's ability to manage their assets. The collapse of FTX led to a sharp decline in investment in the cryptocurrency market, which further exacerbated the crisis.\n\n#### Effects on other cryptocurrency firms and cryptocurrency markets\n\nThe collapse of FTX had a significant impact on other cryptocurrency firms and exchanges, which struggled to maintain their liquidity and stability. Many firms and exchanges were forced to suspend their operations or undergo significant restructuring.\n\nThe crisis also had a significant impact on the cryptocurrency market as a whole, which was plagued by a series of flash crashes and trading halts. The market was characterized by high volatility and low liquidity, which made it difficult for investors to trade and for firms to operate.\n\n#### Responses and commentary\n\nThe collapse of FTX was widely condemned by regulators and industry leaders, who accused the company of engaging in reckless and irresponsible behavior. The SEC, in particular, was critical of FTX's failure to disclose the risks associated with its products and its unauthorized use of customer funds.\n\nSam Bankman-Fried, the CEO of FTX, was accused of making false statements to investors and of using customer funds for the benefit of his sister company, Alameda Research. The collapse of FTX led to a significant decline in Bankman-Fried's reputation and a loss of confidence in his leadership.\n\n**Legal process**\n\nThe collapse of FTX led to a significant legal process, which involved the SEC, the US Department of Justice, and other regulatory bodies. The SEC launched an investigation into FTX's activities, which led to a series of charges and lawsuits.\n\nSam Bankman-Fried was charged with conspiracy, wire fraud, and securities fraud, among other crimes. He was also accused of making false statements to investors and of using customer funds for the benefit of his sister company, Alameda Research.\n\nThe case against Bankman-Fried was significant, as it marked a major milestone in the regulation of the cryptocurrency industry. The case highlighted the need for greater regulation and oversight of the industry, which had been plagued by a series of high-profile hacks and scams.\n\n**Sponsorships**\n\nFTX was a major sponsor of several events and organizations in the cryptocurrency industry. The company sponsored the FTX Arena, a popular venue in Los Angeles, and was a major sponsor of the Miami Heat basketball team.\n\nFTX also sponsored several cryptocurrency conferences and events, including the FTX Summit and the Blockchain Week conference. The company's sponsorship of these events helped to further boost its reputation and visibility in the industry.\n\n**References**\n\nThis article does not include any citations or references, as the information is based on publicly available sources.\n\n**External links**\n\n* FTX official website\n* SEC charges against FTX and Sam Bankman-Fried\n* Department of Justice charges against FTX and Sam Bankman-Fried\n* FTX Summit website\n* Blockchain Week conference website", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

He was a liaison officer with the First Motion Picture Unit, which produced training films for the military. Reagan was honorably discharged in 1945.\n\n### Screen Actors Guild presidency\n\nReagan's presidency of the SAG was marked by his efforts to promote the interests of actors and to combat communism in the entertainment industry. He was a vocal critic of the Hollywood Blacklist and worked to restore the careers of blacklisted actors.\n\n### Marriages and children\n\nReagan married Jane Wyman in 1940, and they had two children, Maureen and Michael.

The policies included reductions in corporate tax rates and the capital gains tax, as well as the elimination of many government regulations.\n\n### Taxation\n\nReagan's tax policies were highly unpopular with many Democrats and liberal economists, who argued that they would increase the national debt and hurt the poor and middle class.

The deficits were financed by a combination of tax increases and borrowing.\n\n### Assassination attempt\n\nOn March 30, 1981, just 69 days into his presidency, Reagan was the target of an assassination attempt by John Hinckley Jr. Reagan was shot in the chest and seriously injured, but he recovered quickly and continued to serve as president.\n\n### Supreme Court appointments\n\nDuring his presidency, Reagan appointed two justices to the Supreme Court: Sandra Day O'Connor and Antonin Scalia.

The administration implemented a number of policies designed to promote diversity and inclusion, including affirmative action programs and increased funding for minority-serving institutions.\n\n### War on drugs\n\nReagan's administration also launched a \"War on Drugs,\" which was designed to reduce the use and trafficking of illicit substances.

The administration established a number of programs and agencies to combat the disease, including the Office of National AIDS Policy.\n\n### Addressing apartheid\n\nReagan's administration also addressed the issue of apartheid in South Africa, which was a major human rights crisis in the 1980s.

The incident was widely criticized, and it led to increased tensions between the United States and Iraq.\n\n### Soviet decline and thaw in relations\n\nDuring the 1980s, the Soviet Union began to decline, and the United States and Soviet Union began to thaw their relations.

Born in 1540 in Tavistock, Devon, England, Drake rose to prominence as a seafarer, privateer, and naval commander, and his exploits helped shape the course of English history.\n\n**Birth and Early Years**\n\nFrancis Drake was born in 1540 in Tavistock, a small market town in Devon, England. His father, Edmund Drake, was a tenant farmer and a member of the local clergy, while his mother, Mary Mylway, was the daughter of a local blacksmith. Little is known about Drake's early life, but it is believed that he received a basic education and was trained as a sailor from a young age. It is also reported that Drake's family was part of the local gentry, and he was likely exposed to the world of trade and commerce from an early age.\n\n**Early Career at Sea**\n\nDrake's early career at sea began when he joined the crew of a merchant vessel as a teenager. He quickly gained experience and skills as a sailor, navigator, and merchant, and by the early 1560s, he had become a seasoned mariner. Drake's early career was marked by a series of voyages to the Caribbean and the Americas, where he worked as a trader, privateer, and explorer.\n\n**Slave Trade**\n\nOne of Drake's early notable achievements was his involvement in the slave trade. In the 1560s, Drake was part of a group of English privateers who were licensed by the English Crown to attack and capture Spanish and Portuguese ships in the Caribbean. Drake's ships attacked and captured several Spanish and Portuguese vessels, including a number of slave ships, which he then used to transport enslaved Africans to the Americas.\n\n**Expedition of 1572–1573**\n\nIn 1572, Drake embarked on his first major expedition, which lasted for over a year. The expedition was a privateering voyage, during which Drake and his crew attacked and captured several Spanish and Portuguese ships, as well as a number of Spanish and Portuguese colonies in the Caribbean. The expedition was a significant success for Drake, and it helped establish him as a prominent figure in the world of privateering.\n\n**Rathlin Island Massacre**\n\nOne of the most notorious incidents of Drake's career occurred in 1573, when he and his crew attacked and slaughtered a group of Irishmen on Rathlin Island, off the coast of Northern Ireland. The incident, known as the Rathlin Island massacre, was a brutal and unprovoked attack, and it has been the subject of much controversy and debate over the years.\n\n**Circumnavigation (1577–1580)**\n\nIn 1577, Drake embarked on his most famous expedition, a circumnavigation of the globe. The expedition was a privately funded voyage, during which Drake and his crew attacked and captured several Spanish and Portuguese ships, as well as a number of Spanish and Portuguese colonies in the Americas. The expedition was a significant success for Drake, and it helped establish him as one of the most famous explorers of his time.\n\n**Execution of Thomas Doughty**\n\nDuring the circumnavigation, Drake's expedition was joined by a group of English privateers, including Thomas Doughty, a prominent merchant and explorer. However, Doughty soon fell out of favor with Drake, who accused him of treason and had him executed on the high seas.\n\n**Entering the Pacific (1578)**\n\nIn 1578, Drake's expedition entered the Pacific Ocean, where they encountered a number of Spanish and Portuguese ships, as well as a number of indigenous peoples. The expedition was a significant success, and it helped establish Drake as one of the first Englishmen to explore the Pacific.\n\n**Raids on Spanish American West Coast**\n\nDuring the circumnavigation, Drake's expedition raided and attacked several Spanish and Portuguese colonies on the west coast of South America. The raids were a significant success, and they helped establish Drake as a formidable opponent of Spanish and Portuguese power.\n\n**Coast of California: Nova Albion (1579)**\n\nIn 1579, Drake's expedition arrived on the coast of California, where they established a base camp, which they called Nova Albion. The base camp was a significant achievement, and it marked the first English settlement on the West Coast of North America.\n\n**Across the Pacific and around Africa**\n\nIn 1580, Drake's expedition crossed the Pacific Ocean and sailed around Africa, returning to Plymouth, England, where they were greeted as heroes.\n\n**Return to Plymouth (1580)**\n\nDrake's return to Plymouth in 1580 was a major event, and it marked the end of his famous circumnavigation. The expedition was a significant success, and it helped establish Drake as one of the most famous explorers of his time.\n\n**Knighthood and Arms**\n\nIn 1581, Drake was knighted by Queen Elizabeth I for his services to the English Crown. He was also granted a coat of arms, which featured a ship and a dragon, symbolizing his bravery and achievement at sea.\n\n**Political Career**\n\nDrake's political career began in the late 1570s, when he was appointed as a member of the English Parliament. He served as a member of Parliament for several years, during which he advocated for the rights of English sailors and merchants.\n\n**Great Expedition to America**\n\nIn 1585, Drake led a major expedition to America, which was intended to establish a permanent English settlement on the continent. The expedition was a significant failure, and it marked the end of Drake's career as an explorer.\n\n**Conflict with the Spanish Armada**\n\nIn the late 1580s, Drake was involved in a series of conflicts with the Spanish Armada, which was a powerful fleet of Spanish ships that threatened English shipping and trade. Drake played a key role in the defeat of the Spanish Armada, which was a major victory for the English.\n\n**Cádiz Raid**\n\nIn 1587, Drake led a raid on the Spanish port of Cádiz, which was a major success. The raid was a significant blow to Spanish power, and it helped establish Drake as a formidable opponent of Spanish forces.\n\n**Defeat of the Spanish Armada**\n\nIn 1588, Drake played a key role in the defeat of the Spanish Armada, which was a major victory for the English. The defeat of the Spanish Armada marked the end of Spanish power in the Atlantic, and it established the English as a major naval power.\n\n**English Armada**\n\nIn the late 1580s, Drake was involved in the creation of the English Armada, which was a powerful fleet of English ships that was intended to challenge Spanish power in the Atlantic. The English Armada was a significant success, and it marked the beginning of English dominance of the Atlantic.\n\n**Defeats and Death**\n\nIn the early 1590s, Drake's fortunes began to decline, and he suffered a series of defeats at the hands of the Spanish and the French. He died in 1596, at the age of 56, on board his ship, the Golden Hind, off the coast of Panama.\n\n**Family and Heritage**\n\nDrake was married to Mary Newman, and they had a daughter, Frances, who was born in 1577. Drake's family was part of the local gentry, and they were well-respected in their community.\n\n**Legacy and Honours**\n\nDrake's legacy is complex and multifaceted. He was a pioneer of English privateering, and his exploits helped shape the course of English history. He was also a skilled navigator and explorer, who played a key role in the discovery of the Pacific and the defeat of the Spanish Armada. Drake's legacy has endured for centuries, and he remains one of the most famous explorers of all time.\n\n**Geographical Names**\n\nDrake's legacy can be seen in a number of geographical names around the world. The city of Drake, California, was named after him, and there are also streets, parks, and monuments dedicated to his memory in England, the United States, and other countries.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Elizabeth I of England\n* Spanish Armada\n* English Armada\n* Privateering\n* Exploration of the Pacific\n* Circumnavigation\n\n**References**\n\n* Drake, F.

The incidents have drawn comparisons to a similar controversy involving former President Donald Trump and have sparked debate about the handling of classified information by public officials.\n\n**Background**\n\nAs a former Vice President and later President, Joe Biden was privy to sensitive information and had access to classified documents during his tenure in office. Upon leaving the White House, Biden returned to his private residence in Wilmington, Delaware, where he stored various documents and personal items.\n\n**Discoveries and other developments**\n\n### **First batch of documents**\n\nOn November 2, 2022, The Washington Post reported that a small number of classified documents from the Biden administration were found at his home in Wilmington, Delaware. The documents, which included briefing materials and other sensitive information, were reportedly found in a locked garage attached to the home. The discovery sparked concerns about the potential mishandling of classified information and raised questions about how the documents had ended up in an unsecured location.\n\n### **DOJ letter to Bob Bauer**\n\nIn response to the discovery, the Department of Justice (DOJ) issued a letter to Bob Bauer, the former White House counsel to President Biden, requesting information about the handling of classified documents. The letter, which was obtained by The Washington Post, asked Bauer to provide details about when the documents were last reviewed, who had access to them, and whether they were properly stored.\n\n### **Second batch of documents**\n\nOn January 9, 2023, The New York Times reported that a second batch of classified documents was found at Biden's home in Wilmington. The documents, which included intelligence reports and other sensitive information, were reportedly found in a folder in the garage. The discovery raised new concerns about the handling of classified information and the potential security risks associated with the presence of such documents in an unsecured location.\n\n### **FBI search of Biden's Wilmington home**\n\nOn January 20, 2023, the FBI conducted a search of Biden's home in Wilmington, reportedly to look for additional classified documents.

The searches were reportedly part of the ongoing investigation into the handling of classified information.\n\n**Initial responses**\n\n### **Biden and his legal team**\n\nPresident Biden has maintained that he was unaware of the presence of classified documents at his home and has stated that he has cooperated fully with the investigation. His legal team has released statements saying that the President has taken the matter seriously and has taken steps to ensure the secure storage of classified documents.\n\n### **Elected officials**\n\n### **Republican elected officials**\n\nRepublican elected officials, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, have called for transparency and accountability in the handling of classified information.

Some have raised questions about the handling of classified information by public officials and the need for greater transparency and accountability.\n\n### **Misinformation**\n\nThe incident has also been marred by misinformation, with some outlets spreading false claims about the President's handling of classified information. The White House has pushed back against these claims, stating that they are unfounded and misleading.\n\n### **Discovery of classified documents at Mike Pence's residence**\n\nOn January 24, 2023, it was reported that a small number of classified documents had been found at the home of former Vice President Mike Pence. The documents, which included briefing materials and other sensitive information, were reportedly found in a box in Pence's home. The discovery sparked new concerns about the handling of classified information and raised questions about the potential security risks associated with the presence of such documents in an unsecured location.\n\n**Investigations**\n\n### **Special counsel**\n\nIn January 2023, it was announced that a special counsel would be appointed to investigate the handling of classified information by President Biden and his administration. The special counsel, John Durham, was reportedly tasked with determining whether the President had mishandled classified information and whether any laws had been broken.\n\n### **Decision that charges were unwarranted**\n\nIn February 2023, the special counsel announced that he had found no evidence to support charges against President Biden or his administration. The decision was seen as a significant development in the ongoing investigation and raised questions about the scope and focus of the inquiry.\n\n### **Comments on Biden's memory**\n\nThe special counsel also made comments about President Biden's memory, stating that he had cooperated fully with the investigation and had been truthful about his handling of classified information. The comments were seen as a positive development for the President and his team.\n\n**Congressional**\n\nCongress has also become involved in the controversy, with some lawmakers calling for greater transparency and accountability in the handling of classified information.

The battle was a key moment in the United Nations Command's (UNC) effort to repel the Chinese Spring Offensive, a massive assault launched by the People's Volunteer Army (PVA) against the UNC's defensive positions along the 38th parallel. The battle saw the Australian 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (3 RAR), and the Canadian 2nd Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry (2 PPCLI), fighting against overwhelming odds, ultimately securing a strategic victory that halted the Chinese advance.\n\n**Military Situation**\n\nBy the spring of 1951, the Korean War had been raging for over a year. The UNC, led by General Douglas MacArthur, had made significant gains against the North Korean Army, pushing them back beyond the 38th parallel. However, the PVA, led by General Peng Dehuai, had begun to assemble a massive force of over 300,000 troops, which would launch a massive assault against the UNC's defensive positions. The UNC, with over 200,000 troops, was well dug-in along the 38th parallel, with a series of fortified defensive positions, including the Kapyong Valley.\n\n**Chinese Spring Offensive**\n\n**Preparations**\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the Chinese Spring Offensive, the PVA conducted a series of reconnaissance missions, aimed at identifying the UNC's defensive positions. The PVA also launched a series of propaganda campaigns, aimed at demoralizing the UNC troops and sowing discord among the alliance. Meanwhile, the UNC troops, including the Australian and Canadian units, were preparing for the expected assault, conducting training exercises and reinforcing their defensive positions.\n\n**Launch of Chinese Spring Offensive**\n\nOn 22 April 1951, the PVA launched a massive assault against the UNC's defensive positions, with over 300,000 troops pouring across the 38th parallel. The assault was supported by a massive artillery bombardment, with over 10,000 artillery pieces firing on the UNC positions. The PVA troops were well-trained and well-equipped, with significant advantages in numbers, firepower, and logistics. However, the UNC troops, despite being outnumbered and outgunned, were well-led and well-trained, with a strong fighting spirit.\n\n**South Korean withdrawal, 22–23 April 1951**\n\nOn 22 April 1951, the South Korean 6th Regiment, 1st Infantry Division, was tasked with holding the Kapyong Valley, a strategic location that controlled access to the 38th parallel. However, under intense PVA pressure, the South Koreans withdrew from the valley, abandoning their defensive positions. The Australian 3 RAR, which was positioned to the south of the Kapyong Valley, was tasked with holding the valley, but they were vastly outnumbered and outgunned.\n\n**Australian 3 RAR defence of Hill 504, 23–24 April 1951**\n\n**Night battle**\n\nOn 23 April 1951, the Australian 3 RAR, led by Lieutenant Colonel William C. Harris, launched a series of counterattacks against the PVA troops, which had infiltrated the Kapyong Valley. The Australians fought bravely, but they were vastly outnumbered and outgunned. Despite being surrounded, the Australians held their ground, inflicting significant casualties on the PVA troops. However, they were unable to stem the PVA tide, and by dawn on 24 April, the PVA had pushed the Australians back to Hill 504, a strategic location that controlled access to the Kapyong Valley.\n\n**Day battle**\n\nOn 24 April 1951, the PVA launched a series of intense attacks against the Australian positions on Hill 504. The Australians fought bravely, but they were vastly outnumbered and outgunned. Despite being surrounded, the Australians held their ground, inflicting significant casualties on the PVA troops. However, by the end of the day, the Australians had been pushed back to the hill's crest, and they were running low on ammunition and supplies.\n\n**3 RAR withdraws**\n\nOn 24 April 1951, the Australian 3 RAR, led by Lieutenant Colonel Harris, was ordered to withdraw from Hill 504, as the PVA had overwhelmed the UNC positions to the south. The Australians fought bravely, but they were vastly outnumbered and outgunned. Despite being surrounded, the Australians managed to extract most of their troops from the battle, but they left behind several wounded soldiers, who were eventually rescued by other UNC troops.\n\n**Canadian 2 PPCLI last stand on Hill 677, 24–25 April 1951**\n\n**Preparations**\n\nOn 24 April 1951, the Canadian 2nd Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry (2 PPCLI), was tasked with holding Hill 677, a strategic location that controlled access to the Kapyong Valley. The Canadians, led by Major Charles S. Watters, were vastly outnumbered and outgunned, but they were determined to hold their ground.\n\n**Night battle**\n\nOn 24 April 1951, the PVA launched a series of intense attacks against the Canadian positions on Hill 677. The Canadians fought bravely, but they were vastly outnumbered and outgunned. Despite being surrounded, the Canadians held their ground, inflicting significant casualties on the PVA troops. However, by dawn on 25 April, the PVA had pushed the Canadians back to the hill's crest, and they were running low on ammunition and supplies.\n\n**Final 2 PPCLI Operations**\n\nOn 25 April 1951, the Canadian 2 PPCLI, led by Major Watters, launched a series of counterattacks against the PVA troops, which had infiltrated the Kapyong Valley. The Canadians fought bravely, but they were vastly outnumbered and outgunned. Despite being surrounded, the Canadians managed to extract most of their troops from the battle, but they left behind several wounded soldiers, who were eventually rescued by other UNC troops.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\n**Summary and casualties**\n\nThe Battle of Kapyong was a pivotal engagement fought during the Korean War, which took place from 22 to 25 April 1951. The battle saw the Australian 3 RAR, and the Canadian 2 PPCLI, fighting against overwhelming odds, ultimately securing a strategic victory that halted the Chinese advance. The UNC troops suffered significant casualties, with over 900 killed, wounded, or missing in action. The PVA troops also suffered significant casualties, with over 3,600 killed, wounded, or missing in action.\n\n**Awards**\n\nThe Battle of Kapyong was a major turning point in the Korean War, and it earned several notable awards. The Australian 3 RAR was awarded the United States Presidential Unit Citation, and the Canadian 2 PPCLI was awarded the United States Presidential Unit Citation. Several individual soldiers, including Lieutenant Colonel Harris and Major Watters, were awarded the Medal of Honor, the highest military honor in the United States.\n\n**Subsequent operations**\n\nThe Battle of Kapyong marked a significant turning point in the Korean War. The UNC troops, led by General Douglas MacArthur, launched a series of counterattacks against the PVA troops, which had been pushed back beyond the 38th parallel. The UNC troops made significant gains, pushing the PVA back to the Chinese border. The war would eventually end with the signing of the Armistice Agreement on 27 July 1953, which brought an end to hostilities between the UNC and the PVA.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The storm formed in the eastern Caribbean on November 5 and rapidly intensified into a Category 4 hurricane, causing widespread damage and power outages across several islands and countries.\n\nMeteorological history\n\nHurricane Nicole developed from a tropical wave that emerged off the coast of Africa on October 30. The wave moved westward across the tropical Atlantic, gradually organizing into a tropical depression on November 5. The depression strengthened into a tropical storm later that day, and by November 6, it had become a hurricane. Nicole's rapid intensification was fueled by a combination of warm ocean waters, low wind shear, and a moist atmospheric environment.\n\nAs Nicole moved northwestward across the Caribbean, it continued to strengthen, reaching Category 4 status on November 7. The storm's maximum sustained winds reached 140 mph (225 km/h), with higher gusts. Nicole's eye passed just north of the island of Bermuda, causing significant damage and power outages.\n\nPreparations\n\n### Bahamas\n\nThe government of the Bahamas issued a hurricane warning for the northern and central islands, including the capital city of Nassau. Residents were advised to seek shelter in safe locations, and authorities deployed emergency services to assist with evacuations and preparations.\n\n### United States\n\nIn the United States, the National Weather Service issued hurricane watches and warnings for several states, including Florida, Georgia, and the Carolinas. Residents in these areas were advised to prepare for the storm's impact, including stocking up on food and water, securing outdoor items, and boarding up windows.\n\n**Florida**\n\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency on November 7, as Nicole's projected path indicated a potential landfall in the state. The Florida Department of Emergency Management activated its emergency operations center and deployed personnel to assist with preparations and response efforts.\n\nIn Miami-Dade County, residents were advised to evacuate low-lying areas and seek shelter in higher elevation. The city's emergency management agency deployed teams to assist with evacuations and provide support to those in need.\n\n**Neighboring states**\n\nResidents in neighboring states, including Georgia and the Carolinas, were advised to prepare for the storm's impact, including stocking up on food and water, securing outdoor items, and boarding up windows. The National Weather Service issued hurricane watches and warnings for these areas, and authorities deployed emergency services to assist with preparations and response efforts.\n\nImpact\n\n**Lesser Antilles**\n\nNicole passed just north of the island of Barbuda on November 7, causing significant damage and power outages. The storm's strong winds and heavy rainfall caused widespread destruction, including downed power lines, flooded homes, and uprooted trees.\n\n**Greater Antilles**\n\nNicole's impact was also felt in the Greater Antilles, where the storm caused significant damage and power outages. The storm's strong winds and heavy rainfall caused widespread destruction, including downed power lines, flooded homes, and uprooted trees.\n\n**Bahamas**\n\nThe Bahamas were heavily affected by Nicole, with widespread damage and power outages reported across the northern and central islands. The storm's strong winds and heavy rainfall caused significant destruction, including downed power lines, flooded homes, and uprooted trees.\n\n**United States**\n\nNicole made landfall in Florida on November 10, causing significant damage and power outages across the state. The storm's strong winds and heavy rainfall caused widespread destruction, including downed power lines, flooded homes, and uprooted trees.\n\n**Florida**\n\nThe impact of Nicole was particularly severe in Florida, where the storm caused widespread damage and power outages. The storm's strong winds and heavy rainfall caused significant destruction, including downed power lines, flooded homes, and uprooted trees.\n\n**Elsewhere**\n\nNicole's impact was also felt in other parts of the United States, including Georgia and the Carolinas. The storm caused significant damage and power outages across these areas, including downed power lines, flooded homes, and uprooted trees.\n\n**Canada**\n\nNicole's impact was also felt in Canada, where the storm caused significant damage and power outages. The storm's strong winds and heavy rainfall caused widespread destruction, including downed power lines, flooded homes, and uprooted trees.\n\nAftermath\n\nThe aftermath of Nicole was marked by widespread destruction and power outages across the affected areas. The storm's impact was particularly severe in Florida, where the storm caused significant damage and power outages.\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) deployed teams to assist with response and recovery efforts, including providing food, water, and shelter to those in need. The agency also deployed personnel to assist with debris removal and infrastructure repair.\n\nSee also\n\n* List of Category 4 Atlantic hurricanes\n* List of Atlantic hurricane records\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n* National Hurricane Center (NHC) - Hurricane Nicole (2022)\n* National Weather Service (NWS) - Hurricane Nicole (2022)\n* Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) - Hurricane Nicole (2022)", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

Regarded by many as one of the greatest players of all time, Messi has won numerous awards and accolades throughout his career, including six Ballon d'Or awards and ten La Liga titles.\n\nEarly life\n\nLionel Andrés Messi was born on June 24, 1987, in Rosario, Argentina, to Jorge Messi and Celia Cuccittini. He was the third of four children, and his family lived in a modest neighborhood. Messi's father was a steelworker, and his mother was a part-time cleaner.\n\nYouth career\n\nNewell's Old Boys (1995–2000)\n\nMessi began playing football at a young age, joining local club Grandoli at the age of five. He quickly progressed to Newell's Old Boys, a prominent club in Rosario. At Newell's, Messi played alongside his older brother, Rodrigo, and the two formed a formidable partnership on the pitch. However, in 2000, Newell's rejected Messi due to a growth hormone deficiency, which made him ineligible to play in Argentina.\n\nBarcelona (2000–2004)\n\nMessi's family moved to Barcelona, Spain, where he joined FC Barcelona's youth academy, La Masia. Barcelona's president, Joan Gaspart, signed Messi to a contract despite his growth hormone deficiency, and the club provided him with treatment to allow him to play professionally. During his time at La Masia, Messi developed his skills and formed close relationships with his teammates, including Ronaldinho and Samuel Eto'o.\n\nClub career\n\nBarcelona (2004–2021)\n\n2004–2008: Rise to the first team\n\nMessi made his professional debut for Barcelona on October 16, 2004, against Espanyol. He scored his first goal for the club in a 3-0 win over Albacete on November 14, 2004. Under the management of Frank Rijkaard, Messi established himself as a regular starter for the first team, scoring 11 goals in the 2005-06 season.\n\n2008–2012: Success under Pep Guardiola\n\nGuardiola's appointment as manager in 2008 marked a significant turning point in Messi's career. Guardiola implemented a possession-based style of play, which allowed Messi to exploit the opposition's defenses. Under Guardiola, Messi won his first Ballon d'Or award in 2009, and the club won two La Liga titles and one Champions League title.\n\n2012–2014: Record-breaking year and Messidependencia\n\nThe 2012-13 season was Messi's most successful year to date. He scored a record-breaking 91 goals in all competitions, including 46 goals in the league. Messi's performances earned him a third consecutive Ballon d'Or award, and the club won the La Liga title and the Copa del Rey.\n\n2014–2017: Arrival of Luis Enrique and birth of MSN\n\nLuis Enrique replaced Guardiola as manager in 2014, and the club introduced a new playing style, which emphasized speed and counter-attacks. Messi formed a deadly partnership with Neymar and Luis Suárez, known as MSN, and the club won two La Liga titles and one Champions League title.\n\n2017–2021: Final years at Barcelona\n\nAfter Luis Enrique's departure in 2017, Messi continued to excel under the management of Ernesto Valverde. However, the club's financial situation and the COVID-19 pandemic led to significant changes, including the departure of Neymar and Suárez. Messi won his seventh Ballon d'Or award in 2021, but the club's performances declined, and Messi left Barcelona in August 2021.\n\nParis Saint-Germain (2021–2023)\n\nMessi signed a two-year contract with Paris Saint-Germain in August 2021, reuniting with his former manager, Mauricio Pochettino. Under Pochettino's management, Messi formed a new partnership with Kylian Mbappé and the club won the Ligue 1 title and the Coupe de France.\n\nInter Miami (2023–present)\n\nIn January 2023, Messi signed a contract with Inter Miami, becoming the club's first major signing. Messi's arrival marked a significant milestone for the club, and he is expected to play a crucial role in the team's development.\n\nInternational career\n\nMessi made his debut for Argentina in 2005, and he has since become the country's all-time leading scorer. Under the management of Lionel Scaloni, Messi has won the Copa América in 2021 and the Finalissima in 2022.\n\nPlayer profile\n\nStyle of play\n\nMessi is a technically gifted player who excels in various positions, including forward, left winger, and playmaker. He is known for his exceptional dribbling skills, vision, and goal-scoring ability.
