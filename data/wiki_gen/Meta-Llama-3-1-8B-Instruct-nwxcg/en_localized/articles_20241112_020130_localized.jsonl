This phenomenon has occurred throughout history, and various countries have found themselves in this situation. This article will explore the history of embassies without a government in Russia, Spain, Poland, and Afghanistan.\n\nHistory\n\n### Russia (1917–1925)\n\nFollowing the February Revolution in 1917, Russia was in a state of turmoil. The provisional government, led by Alexander Kerensky, was struggling to maintain power as the Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin, gained momentum. On October 25, 1917, the Bolsheviks seized power, and the provisional government was dissolved.\n\n#### Diplomatic missions after 1917\n\nIn the aftermath of the revolution, many foreign diplomatic missions were closed, and their personnel were expelled from the country. The Russian government, now in the hands of the Bolsheviks, was not recognized by many countries, including the United States, which refused to establish formal diplomatic relations.\n\nIn 1918, the Bolsheviks established the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, led by Leon Trotsky, which began to re-establish diplomatic relations with other countries. However, the new government's recognition by the international community was limited, and many countries maintained their diplomatic missions in the Russian Empire, rather than the new Soviet government.\n\n#### Dissolution of the Soviet Union\n\nOn December 26, 1991, the Soviet Union was dissolved, and Russia became an independent state. The Russian government, led by President Boris Yeltsin, inherited the Soviet Union's diplomatic missions, but many of these missions were not recognized by the international community. In the following years, Russia worked to re-establish diplomatic relations with other countries and to re-establish its diplomatic missions.\n\n### Spain (1939–1977)\n\nFollowing the Spanish Civil War, General Francisco Franco's Nationalist forces defeated the Republican government, and Franco became the dictator of Spain. The Republican government, led by President Manuel Azaña, had been recognized by many countries, but after Franco's victory, the international community refused to recognize his government.\n\n#### Diplomatic missions after 1939\n\nIn 1939, the Spanish government, now under Franco, was not recognized by many countries, including the United States, which maintained its diplomatic mission in the Spanish Republic. The Franco government, however, began to re-establish diplomatic relations with other countries, including Germany and Italy.\n\nIn the following years, the Franco government worked to re-establish its diplomatic relations with other countries and to re-establish its diplomatic missions. However, the international community continued to refuse to recognize the Franco government until the Spanish Transition to democracy in the 1970s.\n\n### Poland (1939–1990)\n\nFollowing the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union in 1939, the Polish government, led by President Ignacy Mościcki, was forced to flee the country. The Polish government-in-exile, led by Władysław Raczkiewicz, was established in France and later in the United Kingdom.\n\n#### Diplomatic missions after 1939\n\nIn 1939, the Polish government, now in exile, was not recognized by many countries, including the Soviet Union, which maintained its diplomatic mission in the occupied Poland. The Polish government-in-exile, however, began to re-establish diplomatic relations with other countries, including the United States.\n\nIn the following years, the Polish government-in-exile worked to re-establish its diplomatic relations with other countries and to re-establish its diplomatic missions. However, the international community continued to refuse to recognize the government-in-exile until the end of World War II.\n\n### Afghanistan (2021–present)\n\nFollowing the fall of Kabul to the Taliban in August 2021, the government of Afghanistan, led by President Ashraf Ghani, collapsed, and the country was plunged into chaos. The international community refused to recognize the Taliban government, which was established in the aftermath of the collapse of the previous government.\n\n#### Diplomatic missions after 2021\n\nIn the aftermath of the collapse of the previous government, many foreign diplomatic missions were closed, and their personnel were evacuated from the country. The Taliban government, however, began to re-establish diplomatic relations with other countries, including Pakistan and China.\n\nIn the following years, the Taliban government has worked to re-establish its diplomatic relations with other countries and to re-establish its diplomatic missions.

He was a prominent leader in the Republican Party and a champion of conservative policies. Before entering politics, Reagan had a successful career in the entertainment industry, both on screen and behind the camera. This article will explore Reagan's life, his time in the entertainment industry, his entry into politics, and his presidency.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nRonald Reagan was born on February 6, 1911, in Tampico, Illinois, to John Edward Reagan and Nelle Clyde Wilson Reagan. He grew up in a family of modest means and spent his early years in Illinois and Iowa. Reagan's father was a salesman, and the family moved frequently during his childhood. He developed a strong interest in politics and history at an early age and was an avid reader of books on these subjects.\n\nReagan attended Dixon High School in Dixon, Illinois, where he was an excellent student and a star athlete. He played football, basketball, and baseball, and was elected class president. He graduated in 1928 and went on to attend Eureka College in Illinois, where he studied economics and played football.\n\n**Entertainment Career**\n\nReagan's entry into the entertainment industry began with his work as a sports announcer for a local radio station in Illinois. He later moved to California, where he became a successful actor in film and television. He began his film career in the late 1930s, appearing in small roles in films such as _Love Is on the Air_ (1937) and _Brother Rat_ (1938).\n\n### Radio and Film\n\nReagan's early experience in radio led to a contract with Warner Bros. Studios, where he began to appear in feature films. He was cast in a series of small roles, including _Dark Victory_ (1939) and _Knute Rockne, All American_ (1940). His breakthrough role came in 1940, when he was cast as George Gipp in _Knute Rockne, All American_.

He also supported the construction of the California Aqueduct, which brought water from the Sacramento River to the San Joaquin Valley.\n\n**Seeking the presidency (1975–1981)**\n\nReagan's presidential ambitions began to take shape in the mid-1970s, when he delivered a speech to the Republican National Convention in 1976.

This time, he defeated incumbent President Jimmy Carter in a landslide election.\n\n**1976 Republican primaries**\n\nReagan's first presidential campaign was marked by controversy and division within the Republican Party. He faced opposition from moderate Republicans, who were concerned about his conservative views.\n\n**1980 election**\n\nReagan's 1980 campaign was more successful, and he won the Republican nomination in July of that year.

He also signed the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which eliminated many tax loopholes and reduced tax rates.\n\n### Inflation and unemployment\n\nReagan's economic policies helped to reduce inflation and unemployment, which had been high in the 1970s.

The invasion was widely criticized, but it was also seen as a successful example of American military power.\n\n### 1984 election\n\nReagan ran for re-election in 1984, and he won in a landslide, defeating Democratic nominee Walter Mondale.\n\n### Response to the AIDS epidemic\n\nReagan's administration was criticized for its slow response to the AIDS epidemic, which was a major public health crisis in the 1980s.\n\n### Addressing apartheid\n\nReagan's administration was criticized for its handling of apartheid in South Africa, which was a system of racial segregation and oppression.\n\n### Libya bombing\n\nOn April 15, 1986, Reagan's administration launched a bombing raid on Libya, which was a response to a terrorist attack on a discotheque in Berlin.\n\n### Iran–Contra affair\n\nIn 1986, Reagan's administration became embroiled in the Iran-Contra affair, which involved the sale of arms to Iran and the diversion of funds to Nicaraguan contra rebels.\n\n### The USS Stark incident\n\nOn May 17, 1987, the USS Stark was attacked by an Iraqi warplane, which killed 37 American sailors. The incident was widely criticized, and it led to increased tensions between the United States and Iraq.\n\n### Soviet decline and thaw in relations\n\nReagan's administration was also involved in a series of negotiations with the Soviet Union, which led to a decline in tensions and a thaw in relations.\n\n**Post-presidency (1989–2004)**\n\nAfter leaving office in 1989, Reagan remained active in politics, but he also began to suffer from the effects of Alzheimer's disease. He died on June 5, 2004, at the age of 93.\n\n### Support for Brady Bill\n\nReagan supported the Brady Bill, which was a bill to control gun violence.

He was 93 years old. His funeral was held on June 11, 2004, at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nReagan's legacy is complex and multifaceted. He is remembered as a champion of conservative policies and a strong leader who helped to bring an end to the Cold War. However, he is also remembered for his handling of the AIDS epidemic, his support for apartheid in South Africa, and his involvement in the Iran-Contra affair.\n\n### Historical reputation\n\nReagan's historical reputation is the subject of ongoing debate and discussion. Some historians view him as a great leader who helped to bring about a new era of peace and prosperity. Others view him as a polarizing figure who was responsible for significant damage to the United States and the world.\n\n### Political influence\n\nReagan's political influence extends far beyond his presidency.

He also played a significant role in the development of the English navy and was a key figure in the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588.\n\n**Birth and Early Years**\n\nFrancis Drake was born in the village of Tavistock, Devon, England, around 1540. His father, Edmund Drake, was a Protestant minister and a farmer, and his mother, Mary Mylwaye, was the daughter of a local baker. There is little information available about Drake's early life, but it is believed that he was educated at a local grammar school and later attended the University of Cambridge, where he studied theology.\n\n**Early Career at Sea**\n\nDrake began his career at sea at a young age, working on merchant ships and eventually becoming a master of his own vessel. In the 1560s, he began to make a name for himself as a privateer, attacking Spanish ships and cargo in the Caribbean. This led to a series of voyages to the Americas, during which he developed a reputation as a skilled navigator and a fierce competitor.\n\n### Slave Trade\n\nDrake's early voyages were also marked by his involvement in the slave trade, which was a common practice among European sailors at the time. He is believed to have participated in the capture and transportation of enslaved Africans to the Americas, although there is some debate among historians about the extent of his involvement in this practice.\n\n### Expedition of 1572–1573\n\nIn 1572, Drake set out on his first major expedition, which took him to the West Indies and the Spanish Main. During this voyage, he attacked several Spanish ships and ports, earning a significant amount of wealth and recognition for his bravery and skill.\n\n### Rathlin Island Massacre\n\nIn 1573, Drake and his crew attacked the island of Rathlin off the coast of Ireland, where they killed over 100 Spanish sailors and soldiers. This event became known as the Rathlin Island massacre and was widely reported in Europe at the time.\n\n**Circumnavigation (1577–1580)**\n\nDrake's most famous voyage was his circumnavigation of the globe, which took place from 1577 to 1580. During this voyage, he became the first Englishman to sail around the world and established trade relationships with several Pacific island nations.\n\n### Execution of Thomas Doughty\n\nIn 1577, Drake appointed Thomas Doughty as his second-in-command on his circumnavigation voyage. However, Doughty's behavior became increasingly erratic and disobedient, and Drake ultimately had him executed by hanging for treason and mutiny.\n\n### Entering the Pacific (1578)\n\nIn November 1577, Drake and his crew entered the Pacific Ocean, becoming the first Englishmen to do so. They sailed through the Strait of Magellan at the tip of South America and into the vast expanse of the Pacific.\n\n### Raids on Spanish American West Coast\n\nDuring their voyage through the Pacific, Drake and his crew raided several Spanish shipping ports and towns, including the city of Valparaíso in present-day Chile.\n\n### Coast of California: Nova Albion (1579)\n\nIn June 1579, Drake and his crew landed on the coast of what is now California, near present-day Point Reyes. They claimed the area for England and named it Nova Albion, which translates to \"New England\". This was the first European settlement in what is now the United States.\n\n### Across the Pacific and around Africa\n\nAfter spending several months on the west coast of North America, Drake set sail across the Pacific with his crew. They sailed down the west coast of South America and around Cape Horn, entering the Atlantic Ocean and making their way back to England.\n\n### Return to Plymouth (1580)\n\nDrake and his crew returned to Plymouth in September 1580, after a voyage of nearly three years. They were greeted as heroes and celebrated for their bravery and skill.\n\n### Knighthood and Arms\n\nIn 1581, Drake was knighted by Queen Elizabeth I for his services to the English navy. He was also granted a coat of arms, which featured a dragon and a motto that translates to \"I will not be defeated\".\n\n**Political Career**\n\nDrake's political career was marked by his support for the English navy and his opposition to the Spanish. He served as a member of Parliament for several years and was a key figure in the development of the English navy.\n\n### Great Expedition to America\n\nIn 1585, Drake led a fleet of ships to the Americas, where they established a settlement at Roanoke Island in present-day North Carolina. However, the settlement ultimately failed, and the colonists disappeared.\n\n### Conflict with the Spanish Armada\n\nIn 1588, Drake played a key role in the defeat of the Spanish Armada, a fleet of ships sent by King Philip II of Spain to invade England. Drake and his crew attacked the Spanish ships and cargo, using their knowledge of the English coast and their superior sailing skills to outmaneuver the Spanish.\n\n### Cádiz Raid\n\nIn 1587, Drake led an expedition to the port city of Cádiz in Spain, where they attacked the Spanish navy and destroyed several ships.\n\n### Defeat of the Spanish Armada\n\nIn 1588, Drake played a key role in the defeat of the Spanish Armada, which was attempting to invade England. He and his crew attacked the Spanish ships and cargo, using their knowledge of the English coast and their superior sailing skills to outmaneuver the Spanish.\n\n### English Armada\n\nIn 1589, Drake led an English fleet to the Atlantic coast of Spain, where they attacked the Spanish navy and destroyed several ships.\n\n**Defeats and Death**\n\nDrake's later years were marked by a series of defeats and setbacks. In 1590, he led an expedition to the Azores, but was defeated by the Spanish. He died on January 28, 1596, off the coast of Panama, while on a voyage to the Spanish Main.\n\n**Family and Heritage**\n\nDrake married three times and had several children. He left behind a significant legacy, including a number of ships and a coat of arms.\n\n**Legacy and Honours**\n\nDrake's legacy is marked by his bravery and skill as a sailor and explorer. He was the first Englishman to sail around the world and established trade relationships with several Pacific island nations. He also played a key role in the defeat of the Spanish Armada and was a key figure in the development of the English navy.\n\n### Geographical Names\n\nSeveral geographical features have been named after Drake, including Drake Bay in Costa Rica, Drake Passage in Antarctica, and Drake's Island in England.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* English Navy\n* Spanish Armada\n* Circumnavigation\n* Privateer\n\n**References**\n\n* \n\n**Bibliography**\n\n* \n\n**External Links**\n\n*", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The election was called by the 29th Premier of Ontario, Doug Ford, on May 3, 2022. The election was held to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario, the unicameral provincial legislature of Ontario.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Ontario general election is held every four years. The election is a first-past-the-post system, where the candidate with the most votes in a riding wins the seat. The election is administered by Elections Ontario, a non-partisan agency responsible for conducting elections in Ontario. The election is a significant event in Ontario politics, with the outcome determining the government of the province for the next four years.\n\n**Timeline**\n\n### 2018\n\nThe previous Ontario general election was held on June 7, 2018. The election was won by the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario, with Doug Ford as its leader. The Ontario Liberal Party was defeated, and the Ontario New Democratic Party (NDP) won several seats but failed to form a government. The election marked a significant shift in Ontario politics, with the Progressive Conservatives winning a majority government.\n\n### 2020\n\nIn 2020, the Ontario government passed several pieces of legislation, including the COVID-19 Response and Reforms Implementation Act. The legislation gave the government significant powers to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the ability to impose lockdowns and restrictions on businesses. The legislation was widely criticized by opposition parties and civil liberties groups.\n\n### 2021\n\nIn 2021, the Ontario government announced plans to introduce a new tax on non-essential items, such as candy and gum. The tax, known as the \"non-essential item tax,\" was widely criticized by opposition parties and business groups.

The incident has sparked controversy and raised concerns about the handling of sensitive information.\n\n**Background**\n\nAs the 46th President of the United States, Joe Biden has access to a vast amount of classified information as part of his duties. The President is authorized to declassify certain documents, but it is not clear whether this was done in the case of the documents discovered in 2022 and 2023.\n\n**Discoveries and other developments**\n\n### First batch of documents\n\nOn November 2, 2022, it was reported that Biden's lawyers had discovered a small number of classified documents at his home in Wilmington, Delaware.

This discovery has raised questions about the extent to which classified documents may have been mishandled by officials at various levels of government.\n\n**Investigations**\n\n### Special counsel\n\nIn January 2023, Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed a special counsel to investigate the discovery of classified documents at Biden's home in Wilmington, Delaware. The special counsel is tasked with determining whether any laws were broken in connection with the discovery of the documents.\n\n### Decision that charges were unwarranted\n\nIn March 2023, the special counsel announced that he had determined that charges were unwarranted in connection with the discovery of classified documents at Biden's home in Wilmington, Delaware.

The battle took place in the Kapyong Valley, located in the northwestern part of South Korea, and involved a series of intense battles between United Nations Command (UNC) forces and Chinese People's Volunteer Army (PVA) troops.\n\n**Military Situation**\n\nThe Korean War had been ongoing since the previous year, with the PVA having launched a massive invasion of South Korea in June 1950. The UNC, led by the United States, had successfully pushed the PVA back to the 38th parallel, but the Chinese had been secretly mobilizing troops along the border. By the spring of 1951, the PVA had amassed a large force of over 100,000 troops, which was poised to launch a massive counterattack against the UNC.\n\n**Chinese Spring Offensive**\n\nThe Chinese Spring Offensive, also known as the Third Phase Campaign, was a coordinated attack launched by the PVA on 22 April 1951. The offensive was aimed at pushing the UNC back across the 38th parallel and re-establishing a PVA-controlled zone in South Korea. The PVA divided their forces into three columns, with each column tasked with attacking a different sector of the UNC line.\n\n**Preparations**\n\nThe UNC, aware of the PVA's plans, had been preparing for the Chinese Spring Offensive. The Australian 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (3 RAR), had been tasked with defending a sector of the UNC line in the Kapyong Valley. The 3 RAR had been reinforced with artillery and engineer units, and had established a series of defensive positions along the valley floor.\n\n**Launch of Chinese Spring Offensive**\n\nAt 04:00 on 22 April 1951, the PVA launched their attack, with the three columns pushing forward against the UNC line. The 3 RAR, supported by artillery and air power, initially held off the PVA advance, but the Chinese troops soon began to outflank the Australian positions. As the day wore on, the PVA continued to push forward, and by nightfall, they had established a foothold on the valley floor.\n\n**South Korean withdrawal, 22–23 April 1951**\n\nMeanwhile, the South Korean 1st Battalion, 6th Infantry Regiment, which was tasked with defending a sector of the UNC line to the south of the Kapyong Valley, had begun to fall back in the face of the PVA advance. The South Koreans had been poorly equipped and trained, and were unable to withstand the PVA onslaught. By the evening of 22 April, the South Koreans had withdrawn from their positions, leaving the 3 RAR to face the PVA alone.\n\n**Australian 3 RAR defence of Hill 504, 23–24 April 1951**\n\nOn 23 April 1951, the PVA launched a massive attack against the 3 RAR's defensive positions on Hill 504, located at the southern end of the Kapyong Valley. The Australians, supported by artillery and air power, held off the PVA advance, but the Chinese troops continued to push forward, and by nightfall, they had established a foothold on the hill.\n\n**Night battle**\n\nDuring the night of 23 April 1951, the PVA launched a series of attacks against the 3 RAR's defensive positions on Hill 504. The Australians, supported by artillery and air power, held off the PVA advance, but the Chinese troops continued to push forward, and by dawn, they had established a solid foothold on the hill.\n\n**Day battle**\n\nOn 24 April 1951, the PVA launched a massive attack against the 3 RAR's defensive positions on Hill 504. The Australians, supported by artillery and air power, held off the PVA advance, but the Chinese troops continued to push forward, and by the end of the day, they had established a solid foothold on the hill.\n\n**3 RAR withdraws**\n\nAs the PVA continued to push forward, the 3 RAR was forced to withdraw from Hill 504 on 25 April 1951. The Australians, supported by artillery and air power, continued to hold off the PVA advance, but the Chinese troops eventually established a solid foothold on the hill.\n\n**Canadian 2 PPCLI last stand on Hill 677, 24–25 April 1951**\n\nMeanwhile, the Canadian 2nd Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry (2 PPCLI), which was tasked with defending a sector of the UNC line to the north of the Kapyong Valley, had established a defensive position on Hill 677. The Canadians, supported by artillery and air power, held off the PVA advance, but the Chinese troops continued to push forward, and by the end of the day on 25 April, the Canadians had been forced to withdraw from the hill.\n\n**Preparations**\n\nThe Canadians, supported by artillery and air power, continued to hold off the PVA advance, but the Chinese troops eventually established a solid foothold on Hill 677. As the PVA continued to push forward, the Canadians began to prepare for their last stand on the hill.\n\n**Night battle**\n\nDuring the night of 24 April 1951, the PVA launched a series of attacks against the Canadian defensive positions on Hill 677. The Canadians, supported by artillery and air power, held off the PVA advance, but the Chinese troops continued to push forward, and by dawn, they had established a solid foothold on the hill.\n\n**Final 2 PPCLI Operations**\n\nOn 25 April 1951, the PVA launched a massive attack against the Canadian defensive positions on Hill 677. The Canadians, supported by artillery and air power, held off the PVA advance, but the Chinese troops eventually established a solid foothold on the hill.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe Battle of Kapyong was one of the bloodiest battles of the Korean War, with both sides suffering heavy casualties. The PVA had launched a massive attack against the UNC line, but had been ultimately repelled. The battle had been a significant defeat for the PVA, and had marked a turning point in the war.\n\n**Summary and casualties**\n\nThe UNC had suffered over 2,000 casualties during the battle, including over 700 killed in action. The PVA had suffered over 4,000 casualties, including over 1,500 killed in action.\n\n**Awards**\n\nThe Battle of Kapyong was one of the most highly decorated battles of the Korean War, with numerous awards being given to soldiers on both sides. The Australians and Canadians had been awarded several honors, including the Victoria Cross, the Canadian Medal of Military Valour, and the Australian Medal for Gallantry.\n\n**Subsequent operations**\n\nThe Battle of Kapyong had marked a significant turning point in the war, with the UNC having successfully pushed the PVA back across the 38th parallel. The UNC continued to push forward, eventually reaching the Chinese border and forcing the PVA to withdraw from North Korea.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Korean War\n* Chinese Spring Offensive\n* Third Phase Campaign\n* Battle of Maryang San\n* Battle of Chipyong-ni\n* Battle of Hoengsong\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The Battle of Kapyong was one of the bloodiest battles of the Korean War, with both sides suffering heavy casualties.\n* The battle was a significant defeat for the PVA, and marked a turning point in the war.\n* The battle was highly decorated, with numerous awards being given to soldiers on both sides.\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n* 1.

They are known for their rich cultural heritage, unique language, and significant contributions to the region's history and politics. This article provides an overview of the Bugis people, their origins, history, culture, and traditions.\n\n**Origins and Antecedents**\n\n### Toalean — Pre-Austronesian South Sulawesi\n\nThe earliest known inhabitants of the island of Sulawesi were the Toaleans, a pre-Austronesian people who settled in the southern part of the island around 1000 BCE. The Toaleans are believed to have been influenced by the culture of the mainland of Asia, and their artifacts and traditions reflect this connection.\n\n### The Arrival of Austronesians\n\nAround 500 BCE, the Austronesian people arrived in Sulawesi, bringing with them their language, culture, and technology. The Austronesians displaced the Toaleans and established their own settlements and trade networks. The Austronesians are thought to have originated from the island of Taiwan and migrated to the Philippines, Indonesia, and other parts of Southeast Asia.\n\n### Tana Ogi — Land of the Bugis\n\nThe Bugis people are said to have originated from the island of Tana Ogi, which is located in the southern part of Sulawesi. The name \"Bugis\" is believed to be derived from the word \"Bughis,\" which means \"seafarers\" or \"mariners.\" The Bugis people developed a strong maritime culture and became skilled navigators and traders.\n\n**History**\n\n### Early Society\n\nThe early Bugis society was organized into small villages and settlements, each with its own chief. The Bugis people were skilled farmers, fishermen, and traders, and their economy was based on the production and trade of rice, fish, and other commodities. The Bugis people were also known for their expertise in metalworking and their skill in crafting beautiful textiles and other handicrafts.\n\n### The Growth of Bugis Kingdoms\n\nAs the Bugis people developed their skills and resources, they began to establish larger kingdoms and empires. The most prominent of these kingdoms was the Sultanate of Makassar, which was founded in the 14th century. The Sultanate of Makassar was a powerful and wealthy kingdom that controlled much of the southwestern part of Sulawesi.\n\n### Emergence of New Political Strengths Over the Peninsula\n\nAs the Sultanate of Makassar grew in power, other Bugis kingdoms and states emerged in the region. These kingdoms and states, such as the Sultanate of Bone and the Sultanate of Gowa, vied for power and influence over the region. The Bugis people developed a complex system of politics and diplomacy, with alliances and rivalries between the different kingdoms and states.\n\n### Bugis-Makassar Society in the 16th Century\n\nIn the 16th century, the Bugis-Makassar society was characterized by a complex system of social hierarchy, with the Sultan and his nobles at the top of the social ladder. The Bugis people were known for their expertise in navigation, trade, and warfare, and their society was highly organized and disciplined. The Bugis people were also known for their love of luxury and their flair for the dramatic.\n\n### Early Attempts to Christianize the Bugis States\n\nIn the 16th century, European colonizers, particularly the Portuguese, attempted to Christianize the Bugis states. However, the Bugis people resisted conversion and maintained their traditional Islamic faith. The Bugis people were skilled diplomats and negotiators, and they managed to maintain their independence and sovereignty despite the pressure from European colonizers.\n\n### Quest for Prestige, Influence, and Powers Over the Peninsula\n\nAs the Bugis-Makassar society developed, the Bugis people became increasingly obsessed with the quest for prestige, influence, and power over the peninsula. The Bugis people were known for their elaborate ceremonies, their love of luxury, and their flair for the dramatic. The Bugis people were also known for their skill in warfare and their expertise in navigation and trade.\n\n### The Islamisation of Bugis-Makassar-Mandar\n\nIn the 16th century, the Bugis-Makassar-Mandar region was Islamized, with the arrival of Islamic missionaries and traders. The Bugis people were attracted to Islam's message of monotheism and its emphasis on justice and compassion. The Bugis people were also impressed by Islam's rich cultural heritage and its emphasis on the importance of education and knowledge.\n\n### The Twilight of Dominance\n\nAs the Bugis-Makassar-Mandar region was Islamized, the dominance of the Bugis people began to decline. The Bugis kingdoms and states were eventually absorbed into the Dutch East India Company's colonial empire, and the Bugis people were forced to adapt to a new system of governance and culture.\n\n### A New Golden Age\n\nHowever, despite the decline of the Bugis kingdoms and states, the Bugis people continued to thrive and prosper. The Bugis people developed a new system of government and culture, based on Islamic principles and values. The Bugis people continued to be known for their expertise in navigation, trade, and warfare, and their society was highly organized and disciplined.\n\n**Culture**\n\n### Language and Dialects\n\nThe Bugis people have their own unique language, which is spoken throughout the southwestern part of Sulawesi. The Bugis language is a member of the Austronesian language family and is closely related to other languages spoken in the region. The Bugis language is known for its complexity and its rich cultural heritage.\n\n### Philosophy\n\nThe Bugis people have a rich philosophical tradition, which emphasizes the importance of justice, compassion, and knowledge.

She is the leader of the Brothers of Italy (Fratelli d'Italia) party, a right-wing populist and nationalist party that has gained significant support in recent years.\n\nEarly life\n\nGiorgia Meloni was born on August 15, 1977, in Rome, Italy. Her father, Giuseppe Meloni, was a journalist and a member of the Italian Social Movement (MSI), a far-right political party that opposed the Italian government's policies during World War II. Meloni's mother, Silvana Devincenzi, was a housewife.\n\nEducation and early political activism\n\nMeloni attended the Liceo Classico Enrico Buonanni in Rome, where she was an active member of the MSI's youth wing. She later enrolled in the University of Rome \"La Sapienza,\" where she studied history and graduated in 2000. During her university years, Meloni became involved in the MSI's student organization and participated in several protests against the Italian government's policies.\n\nPolitical career\n\nMeloni's entry into politics began in the early 2000s, when she joined the National Alliance (Alleanza Nazionale), a successor to the MSI. In 2006, she was elected to the Italian Chamber of Deputies, representing the National Alliance in the Lazio region.\n\nMinister of Youth\n\nIn 2008, Meloni was appointed as the Minister of Youth by the then-Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. During her tenure, she introduced several policies aimed at promoting youth employment and education. However, her term was marked by controversy, including criticism for her handling of a scandal involving the use of public funds to finance the Berlusconi government's campaign.\n\nLeader of Brothers of Italy\n\nIn 2012, Meloni left the National Alliance and founded the Brothers of Italy party, which she has led ever since. The party has gained significant support in recent years, particularly among young voters and those who feel disillusioned with the mainstream parties.\n\n2022 Italian general election\n\nIn the 2022 Italian general election, Meloni's Brothers of Italy party won 26% of the vote, making it the largest party in the Italian parliament. The party formed a coalition government with the Lega party and the Forza Italia party, with Meloni becoming the Prime Minister of Italy.\n\nPrime Minister of Italy\n\nGovernment formation\n\nMeloni's government was formed in October 2022, after a series of negotiations with other parties. The government includes several ministers from the Brothers of Italy, the Lega, and Forza Italia parties.\n\nDomestic policies\n\nMeloni's government has introduced several policies aimed at reducing immigration and promoting economic growth. These include plans to increase border controls and reduce the number of asylum seekers. The government has also introduced measures to promote small businesses and entrepreneurship.\n\nConstitutional reform\n\nIn 2023, Meloni's government introduced a constitutional reform aimed at increasing the powers of the Prime Minister and reducing the influence of the Italian parliament. The reform has been met with criticism from opposition parties, who argue that it would concentrate power in the hands of the executive.\n\nForeign policy\n\nMeloni's government has taken a more assertive stance on foreign policy, particularly with regards to the European Union and NATO. The government has opposed the EU's migration policies and has called for a more robust defense of European borders. Meloni has also been critical of the EU's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and has called for greater autonomy for member states.\n\nPolitical positions\n\nSocial issues\n\nMeloni has expressed conservative views on social issues, including opposition to abortion and same-sex marriage. She has also been critical of the Italian government's policies on immigration and multiculturalism.\n\nFeminism\n\nMeloni has been criticized for her views on feminism, which some have characterized as patriarchal and sexist. In 2020, she sparked controversy by saying that feminism had \"become a totalitarian ideology\" that threatened traditional family values.\n\nImmigration and multiculturalism\n\nMeloni has been a vocal critic of immigration and multiculturalism, arguing that they threaten Italian culture and identity. She has called for stricter border controls and has opposed the EU's migration policies.\n\nForeign issues\n\nMeloni has taken a more assertive stance on foreign policy, particularly with regards to the European Union and NATO.

They are predominantly adherents of the Twelver Shia branch of Islam, although smaller groups of Alawites and Isma'ilis also exist within the community.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nLebanese Shia Muslims have a long and complex history that dates back to the early Islamic period. Their community has been shaped by various influences, including the Arab conquest, the Mamluk period, and the French mandate. Today, Lebanese Shia Muslims play an important role in Lebanese politics, economy, and society.\n\n**History**\n\n### **Origins**\n\nThe origins of Shia Islam in Lebanon date back to the early Islamic period, when the Arab conquest of the region led to the spread of Islam. The Shia branch of Islam emerged in the 7th century, with the death of the Prophet Muhammad's cousin and son-in-law, Ali Ibn Abi Talib. The Shia believed that Ali and his descendants, known as the Imams, were the rightful successors to the Prophet, while the Sunni believed that the caliphs, who were not descendants of Ali, should lead the Islamic community.\n\n### **Early Islamic period**\n\nDuring the early Islamic period, Shia Muslims in Lebanon were a minority group within the larger Islamic community. They were often persecuted by the Sunni caliphs and were forced to practice their faith in secret. However, Shia Islam continued to spread, and by the 9th century, they had established a strong presence in the region.\n\n### **Mamluk period**\n\nThe Mamluk period, which lasted from the 13th to the 16th century, saw the rise of Shia Islam in Lebanon. The Mamluk sultans, who were of Turkish origin, tolerated Shia Islam and even granted them certain privileges. Shia Muslims in Lebanon during this period were known for their learning and scholarship, and many became prominent figures in Islamic thought.\n\n### **Under Ottoman rule**\n\nDuring the Ottoman period, which lasted from the 16th to the 20th century, Shia Islam in Lebanon continued to thrive. The Ottomans, who were Sunni Muslims, generally tolerated Shia Islam and allowed them to practice their faith freely. However, Shia Muslims in Lebanon suffered during World War I, when the Ottoman Empire allied itself with the Central Powers and Lebanon was occupied by the Allies.\n\n### **Relations with Safavid Iran**\n\nThe Safavid dynasty, which ruled Iran from the 16th to the 18th century, had a significant impact on Shia Islam in Lebanon. The Safavids, who were Shia Muslims, sought to spread their faith throughout the Middle East and established close relations with Shia Muslims in Lebanon. Many Lebanese Shia Muslims traveled to Iran to study and seek spiritual guidance from the Safavid ulama.\n\n### **French mandate period**\n\nThe French mandate period, which lasted from 1920 to 1946, saw significant changes in the status of Shia Islam in Lebanon. The French, who were Christian, sought to promote the rights of the Christian minority in Lebanon and often clashed with Shia Muslims, who were seen as a threat to their power. However, Shia Muslims in Lebanon also saw the French mandate as an opportunity to modernize and secularize their community.\n\n### **Education**\n\nDuring the French mandate period, Shia Muslims in Lebanon made significant strides in education. The French established a number of schools and universities in Lebanon, which provided Shia Muslims with access to modern education and training. Shia Muslim students from Lebanon also traveled to France and other European countries to study.\n\n### **Ja'fari shar'ia courts**\n\nThe French also established Ja'fari shar'ia courts in Lebanon, which were responsible for administering Shia Islamic law. Shia Muslims in Lebanon saw the establishment of these courts as a major victory, as it gave them the right to govern themselves according to their own laws and customs.\n\n**Sub-groups**\n\n### **Shia Twelvers (Metouali)**\n\nThe Shia Twelvers, also known as the Metouali, are the largest subgroup of Shia Muslims in Lebanon. They believe in the twelve Imams, who are the descendants of Ali Ibn Abi Talib, and see themselves as the rightful successors to the Prophet Muhammad. The Metouali are known for their learning and scholarship, and have produced many prominent figures in Islamic thought.\n\n### **Alawites**\n\nThe Alawites are a smaller subgroup of Shia Muslims in Lebanon. They are a branch of Shia Islam that emerged in the 9th century, and are known for their distinct rituals and practices. The Alawites are predominantly found in the coastal regions of Lebanon and are known for their strong sense of community and identity.\n\n### **Isma'ilis**\n\nThe Isma'ilis are a smaller subgroup of Shia Muslims in Lebanon. They are a branch of Shia Islam that emerged in the 9th century, and are known for their distinct rituals and practices. The Isma'ilis are predominantly found in the regions of Lebanon and are known for their strong sense of community and identity.\n\n**Geographic distribution within Lebanon**\n\nShia Muslims in Lebanon are predominantly found in the coastal regions, particularly in the cities of Beirut and Sidon. They are also found in the Bekaa Valley, which is a major agricultural region in Lebanon.\n\n**Demographics**\n\nAccording to the last census in 2020, Shia Muslims in Lebanon account for around 27% of the country's population. They are the second-largest minority group in Lebanon, after the Sunni Muslims.\n\n**Genetics**\n\nStudies have shown that Shia Muslims in Lebanon have a distinct genetic profile that is different from other Muslim groups in the region. They have a high frequency of the Y-chromosome haplogroups J2 and J1, which are common among Arab populations.\n\n**Notable Lebanese Shia Muslims**\n\n### **Religious figures**\n\n* Sayyed Fadlallah, a prominent Shia cleric and leader.\n* Sayyed Mohamad Hussein Fadlullah, a prominent Shia cleric and leader.\n* Sayyed Ali Khamenei, a prominent Shia cleric and leader who served as the Supreme Leader of Iran.\n\n### **Political figures**\n\n* Amal Movement leader, Nabih Berri.\n* Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah.\n* Speaker of the Parliament of Lebanon, Nabih Berri.\n\n### **Academics**\n\n* Abdul Karim Qassem, a prominent Shia scholar and historian.\n* Sayyed Mohsen Sadr, a prominent Shia scholar and historian.\n* Ali Hashem, a prominent Shia scholar and historian.\n\n### **Artists, singers and journalists**\n\n* Fairouz, a prominent Lebanese singer and actress.\n* Wadih el Safi, a prominent Lebanese singer and actor.\n* Layla Mourad, a prominent Lebanese singer and actress.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Shia Islam\n* Twelver Shia Islam\n* Alawite\n* Isma'ili\n* Lebanese people\n\n**References**\n\nThis article is based on a variety of sources, including:\n\n* The History of Islam in Lebanon\n* The Shia in Lebanon\n* The Alawites in Lebanon\n* The Isma'ilis in Lebanon\n* The Encyclopedia of Lebanon", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

Regarded by many as one of the greatest footballers of all time, Messi has won numerous accolades and broken numerous records in the sport. Born on June 24, 1987, in Rosario, Argentina, Messi began playing football at a young age and quickly rose through the ranks to become one of the most dominant players in the world.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nMessi was born to Jorge Messi, a steelworker, and Celia Cuccittini, a part-time cleaner. He grew up in a working-class neighborhood in Rosario, where he was raised alongside his four siblings. Messi's father was a football enthusiast and began coaching his son at the age of 5. Messi's early life was marked by a rare condition called growth hormone deficiency, which was diagnosed when he was 11 years old. The condition stunted his growth, and his family could not afford the treatment. However, FC Barcelona, a prominent Spanish football club, agreed to cover the costs of Messi's treatment, and he joined the club's youth academy in 2000.\n\n**Youth Career**\n\n#### Newell's Old Boys (1995–2000)\n\nMessi began playing football at the age of 5 for Grandoli, a local club in Rosario. He then joined Newell's Old Boys, a prominent Argentine club, at the age of 8. Messi's talent and dedication quickly earned him a spot on the club's youth team. He played for Newell's Old Boys until 2000, when he joined FC Barcelona's youth academy.\n\n#### Barcelona (2000–2004)\n\nMessi's family moved to Barcelona, Spain, in 2000 to allow him to join the club's youth academy. Messi quickly adapted to the Spanish culture and began to develop his skills on the pitch. He played for Barcelona's youth teams, including the Juvenil A team, which competes in the Spanish championship. Messi's impressive performances earned him a spot on the first team's reserve squad, and he made his professional debut in 2004.\n\n**Club Career**\n\n#### Barcelona (2004–2021)\n\n##### 2004–2008: Rise to the first team\n\nMessi's professional career began in 2004 when he made his debut for Barcelona's first team under coach Frank Rijkaard.

His impressive performances earned him the 2005 FIFA World Player of the Year award, becoming the youngest player to win the award.\n\n##### 2008–2012: Success under Pep Guardiola\n\nIn 2008, Pep Guardiola took over as coach of Barcelona, and Messi's performances soared. Under Guardiola, Messi won numerous titles, including two UEFA Champions League titles, three La Liga titles, and the FIFA Club World Cup. Messi's goal-scoring record improved significantly, and he became one of the top goal-scorers in the world.\n\n##### 2012–2014: Record-breaking year and Messidependencia\n\nIn 2012, Messi had a record-breaking year, scoring 91 goals in all competitions. He won the Ballon d'Or for the fourth consecutive time and became the all-time leading scorer in La Liga. Barcelona's reliance on Messi, dubbed \"Messidependencia,\" became a topic of discussion, with some critics arguing that the team's success was solely dependent on Messi's performances.\n\n##### 2014–2017: Arrival of Luis Enrique and birth of MSN\n\nIn 2014, Luis Enrique took over as coach of Barcelona, and Messi's performances continued to impress. Messi formed a deadly attacking trio with Luis Suarez and Neymar, known as MSN. The trio won numerous titles, including two La Liga titles and the UEFA Champions League.\n\n##### 2017–2021: Final years at Barcelona\n\nIn 2017, Barcelona signed a new coach, Ernesto Valverde, and Messi's performances began to decline. Messi's relationship with the club's board and fans became strained, and he was linked with a move to other clubs. Despite this, Messi continued to perform at a high level, winning the 2019 Champions League title with Barcelona.\n\n#### Paris Saint-Germain (2021–2023)\n\nIn August 2021, Messi joined Paris Saint-Germain on a free transfer, signing a two-year contract. Messi's move to PSG was seen as a major coup for the club, and he was expected to lead the team to success in the Champions League.\n\n#### Inter Miami (2023–present)\n\nIn January 2023, Messi joined Inter Miami, a Major League Soccer team, on a two-year contract. Messi's move to Miami was seen as a significant signing for the team, and he was expected to lead the team to success in the MLS.\n\n**International Career**\n\nMessi made his debut for the Argentina national team in 2005 and has since become one of the team's most prolific goal-scorers.

The term \"Founding Fathers\" was first used in the 18th century to describe the key figures who played a significant role in the American Revolution and the drafting of the United States Constitution.\n\n**Historical founders**\n\nThe Founding Fathers were not a formally organized group, but rather a collection of individuals who shared a common goal of creating a new nation based on democratic principles. They came from diverse backgrounds, including politics, law, commerce, and the military.\n\n**Origin of phrase**\n\nThe term \"Founding Fathers\" was first used in the 1700s to describe the leaders of the American Revolution. The phrase was popularized by actors and playwrights during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The term gained widespread acceptance in the early 20th century, particularly in the 1920s and 1930s, as historians and scholars began to study the Founding Fathers in greater depth.\n\n**List of Founding Fathers**\n\n### Framers and signers\n\nThe Framers and signers of the United States Constitution were a group of 74 individuals who played a key role in shaping the country's government.

In the mid-18th century, tensions began to rise between the colonies and Great Britain. The British government imposed a series of taxes on the colonies, including the Stamp Act and the Townshend Acts. The colonies responded with protests and boycotts, ultimately leading to the First Continental Congress in 1774.\n\n**Continental Congress (1774–1775)**\n\nThe First Continental Congress was a gathering of delegates from the 13 colonies. The Congress drafted a list of grievances against the British government and petitioned for redress. The Congress also formed a committee to coordinate a unified response to British rule.\n\nThe Second Continental Congress, held in 1775, was a more formal gathering of delegates. The Congress drafted a formal declaration of independence and established the Continental Army, with George Washington as its commander-in-chief.\n\n**Declaration of Independence (1776)**\n\nOn July 4, 1776, the Continental Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence, written by Thomas Jefferson. The document declared the 13 colonies to be free and independent states, no longer subject to British rule.\n\n**Fighting for independence**\n\nThe American Revolution was a long and bloody conflict. The Continental Army, led by George Washington, fought against the British army and its allies. The war was marked by several key battles, including the Battle of Bunker Hill and the Battle of Yorktown.\n\n**Treaty of Paris**\n\nThe Treaty of Paris, signed in 1783, officially ended the American Revolution. The treaty recognized the independence of the United States and established the boundaries of the new nation.\n\n**Constitutional Convention**\n\nIn 1787, a group of delegates gathered in Philadelphia to draft a new constitution for the United States. The Constitutional Convention, as it came to be known, was a key moment in American history.\n\n**Virginia and New Jersey plans**\n\nThe Virginia Plan, proposed by James Madison, called for a strong central government with three branches. The New Jersey Plan, proposed by William Paterson, called for equal representation for each state in Congress.\n\n**Connecticut Compromise**\n\nThe Connecticut Compromise, proposed by Roger Sherman and Oliver Ellsworth, called for a bicameral legislature, with the House of Representatives based on population and the Senate based on equal representation for each state.\n\n**State ratification conventions**\n\nAfter the Constitutional Convention, the proposed Constitution was sent to the states for ratification. Each state held a convention to consider the document, with many debates and disagreements along the way.\n\n**New form of government**\n\nThe United States Constitution established a new form of government, with the three branches of government (legislative, executive, and judicial) and a system of checks and balances.\n\n**Bill of Rights**\n\nThe Bill of Rights, added to the Constitution in 1791, established individual rights and freedoms, including freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right to bear arms.\n\n**Ascending to the presidency**\n\nAfter the Constitution was ratified, George Washington was unanimously elected as the first President of the United States. He served two terms, establishing many of the traditions and precedents that would shape the office of the presidency.\n\n**Demographics and other characteristics**\n\nThe Founding Fathers were a diverse group, with varying backgrounds and characteristics.

These tours and series have played a crucial role in shaping the sport, providing a platform for top players to compete against each other and earn recognition. In this article, we will delve into the world of tennis pro tours and tournament ranking series, exploring their history, winners, and notable features.\n\n**World Championship Tours**\n\nThe world championship tours are the premier series of tournaments in tennis, featuring the sport's top players competing in a series of events around the world. These tours are organized by the four major tennis governing bodies: the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), the Women's Tennis Association (WTA), the International Tennis Federation (ITF), and the Grand Slam tournaments. The world championship tours provide a comprehensive ranking system, with players earning points based on their performance in each tournament.\n\nThe ATP World Tour, established in 1990, is the top-tier tour for men's tennis, featuring 64 events around the world. The tour includes the four Grand Slam tournaments – the Australian Open, the French Open, Wimbledon, and the US Open – as well as other high-level events. The ATP World Tour is divided into different categories, including the Masters 1000, the ATP 500, and the ATP 250.\n\nThe WTA Tour, established in 1973, is the top-tier tour for women's tennis, featuring 55 events around the world. The tour includes the four Grand Slam tournaments – the Australian Open, the French Open, Wimbledon, and the US Open – as well as other high-level events. The WTA Tour is divided into different categories, including the Premier Mandatory, the Premier 5, and the International.\n\n**Winners**\n\nThroughout the history of tennis, numerous players have dominated the world championship tours, winning multiple titles and earning recognition as the best players in the world. Some of the most notable winners include:\n\n* Novak Djokovic, who has won a record 18 Grand Slam titles and has held the number one ranking in the world for a record 373 weeks.\n* Rafael Nadal, who has won 22 Grand Slam titles and has held the number one ranking in the world for 275 weeks.\n* Serena Williams, who has won 23 Grand Slam titles and has held the number one ranking in the world for 319 weeks.\n* Roger Federer, who has won 20 Grand Slam titles and has held the number one ranking in the world for 310 weeks.\n\n**Tournament Ranking Series**\n\nIn addition to the world championship tours, there are several other professional tennis tournaments that provide ranking points for players. These tournaments are often lower-level events, but still offer a competitive platform for players to earn recognition and improve their rankings.\n\nThe Challenger Tour, established in 1978, is the second-tier tour for men's tennis, featuring events with a lower level of competition than the ATP World Tour. The Challenger Tour provides a stepping stone for players to move up to the ATP World Tour and compete against the sport's top players.\n\nThe ITF Women's Circuit, established in 1973, is the second-tier tour for women's tennis, featuring events with a lower level of competition than the WTA Tour. The ITF Women's Circuit provides a platform for players to earn ranking points and improve their chances of competing on the WTA Tour.\n\n**Other Professional Tours**\n\nIn addition to the world championship tours and the Challenger Tour, there are several other professional tennis tours that feature lower-level events. These tours provide a platform for players to compete against each other and earn recognition, but are not as competitive as the top-tier tours.\n\n**Women**\n\nThe WTA 125K series, established in 2013, is a series of events that provide a lower level of competition than the WTA Tour. The WTA 125K series features events with a total prize money of $125,000 or more, and provides a platform for players to earn ranking points and improve their chances of competing on the WTA Tour.\n\n**Men**\n\nThe ATP Challenger Tour, established in 1978, is the second-tier tour for men's tennis, featuring events with a lower level of competition than the ATP World Tour. The ATP Challenger Tour provides a stepping stone for players to move up to the ATP World Tour and compete against the sport's top players.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Tennis\n* Grand Slam tournaments\n* Association of Tennis Professionals\n* Women's Tennis Association\n* International Tennis Federation\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The points system used by the ATP and WTA tours is designed to provide a comprehensive ranking system for players.\n* The ATP and WTA tours feature different categories of events, including the Masters 1000, the ATP 500, and the ATP 250 for men, and the Premier Mandatory, the Premier 5, and the International for women.\n* The Challenger Tour and the ITF Women's Circuit provide a platform for players to earn ranking points and improve their chances of competing on the ATP and WTA tours.\n\n**References**\n\n(Note: This article does not include any citations or references)\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n(Note: This article does not include a bibliography)\n\n**External Links**\n\n* ATP World Tour\n* WTA Tour\n* International Tennis Federation\n* Grand Slam tournaments", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The election was triggered by the resignation of Nicola Sturgeon, who had served as the First Minister of Scotland and leader of the SNP since 2014.\n\nBackground\n\nThe Scottish National Party has been the governing party of Scotland since 2007, and Nicola Sturgeon has been its leader since 2014. However, in February 2023, Sturgeon announced her resignation as leader of the SNP, citing a desire to focus on her role as an MSP. The party's deputy leader, Keith Brown, became the interim leader of the SNP until a new leader could be elected.\n\nIssues\n\n### Economics\n\nThe economy was a major issue in the 2023 SNP leadership election. The party's economic policies have been a subject of debate, with some members advocating for a more socialist approach and others pushing for a more centrist approach. The candidates in the election had different views on issues such as taxation, public spending, and the role of the private sector in the economy.\n\n### Independence\n\nThe issue of Scottish independence was also a major factor in the election. The SNP has long been the party of Scottish independence, and many members believe that it is the party's primary goal. However, the candidates in the election had different views on the timing and method of independence.\n\n### Gender recognition reform\n\nThe issue of gender recognition reform was also a contentious issue in the election. The SNP had previously supported the Gender Recognition Act, which allowed individuals to change their gender on official documents without undergoing surgery. However, the party's stance on the issue was criticized by some members, who argued that the act was too permissive.\n\nCampaign\n\n### Nomination period\n\nThe nomination period for the 2023 SNP leadership election began on 15 February 2023 and closed on 27 February 2023. During this period, three candidates emerged as contenders for the leadership: Kate Forbes, Ash Regan, and Humza Yousaf.\n\n### Kate Forbes\n\nKate Forbes is a Scottish politician who has been a member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch since 2016. She was previously the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and the Economy, and was seen as a strong contender for the leadership. Forbes has been a vocal advocate for Scottish independence and has argued that the SNP should prioritize the issue above all else.\n\n### Ash Regan\n\nAsh Regan is a Scottish politician who has been a member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Edinburgh Eastern since 2016. She was previously the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, and was seen as a strong contender for the leadership. Regan has been a vocal advocate for social justice and has argued that the SNP should prioritize issues such as poverty and inequality.\n\n### Humza Yousaf\n\nHumza Yousaf is a Scottish politician who has been a member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Glasgow Pollok since 2016. He was previously the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, and was seen as a strong contender for the leadership. Yousaf has been a vocal advocate for Scottish independence and has argued that the SNP should prioritize the issue above all else.\n\n### Hustings\n\nThe hustings for the 2023 SNP leadership election were held on 1 March 2023 in Edinburgh. The hustings were attended by the three candidates, and were live-streamed on social media. The hustings were marked by a row between Forbes and Regan over membership numbers, with Forbes accusing Regan of making false claims about the party's membership.\n\n### Row about membership numbers\n\nThe row between Forbes and Regan over membership numbers was a major controversy during the hustings.
