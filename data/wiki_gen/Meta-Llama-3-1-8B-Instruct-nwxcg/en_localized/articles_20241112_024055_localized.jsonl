2022 United States House of Representatives elections in New York were held on November 8, 2022, to elect the 27 members of the House of Representatives from the state of New York. The elections were part of the general election held across the United States.\n\n**2020-22 redistricting controversy**\n\nFollowing the 2020 United States Census, New York was required to redraw its congressional district boundaries. However, the process was contentious, with many arguing that the new maps favored Democrats. The controversy led to several lawsuits, including one filed by the New York State Republican Party, which claimed that the new maps were unconstitutional. Despite the controversy, the new maps were ultimately used for the 2022 elections.\n\n**Overview**\n\nIn the 2022 elections, 27 seats were up for election in New York. The elections were held using a first-past-the-post system, where the candidate with the most votes in each district was elected.\n\n**Votes by ballot line**\n\nIn New York, voters can choose to cast their ballots on one of several party lines, including the Republican, Democratic, Conservative, and Libertarian parties. In the 2022 elections, many candidates ran on multiple ballot lines.\n\n**Votes by district**\n\nThe following table shows the number of votes cast for each party in each district:\n\n| District | Democratic | Republican | Conservative | Libertarian |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 |  |  |  |  |\n| 2 |  |  |  |  |\n| 3 |  |  |  |  |\n| 4 |  |  |  |  |\n| 5 |  |  |  |  |\n| 6 |  |  |  |  |\n| 7 |  |  |  |  |\n| 8 |  |  |  |  |\n| 9 |  |  |  |  |\n| 10 |  |  |  |  |\n| 11 |  |  |  |  |\n| 12 |  |  |  |  |\n| 13 |  |  |  |  |\n| 14 |  |  |  |  |\n| 15 |  |  |  |  |\n| 16 |  |  |  |  |\n| 17 |  |  |  |  |\n| 18 |  |  |  |  |\n| 19 |  |  |  |  |\n| 20 |  |  |  |  |\n| 21 |  |  |  |  |\n| 22 |  |  |  |  |\n| 23 |  |  |  |  |\n| 24 |  |  |  |  |\n| 25 |  |  |  |  |\n| 26 |  |  |  |  |\n\n**Seat allocation**\n\nThe following table shows the number of seats won by each party:\n\n| Party | Seats |\n| --- | --- |\n| Democratic | 20 |\n| Republican | 7 |\n\n**District 1**\n\nThe 1st congressional district of New York includes parts of the Bronx and Queens.

The election coincided with the 2022 United States elections.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe Alabama House of Representatives is the lower chamber of the Alabama State Legislature, consisting of 105 members, each representing a district in the state. The majority party, the Republicans, had controlled the chamber since 2010. The election was seen as a key test of the Republican Party's strength in the state, following a tumultuous year marked by legislative redistricting and the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n**Retirements**\n\n### Republicans\n\nSeveral Republican incumbents chose not to seek re-election in 2022. These included:\n\n* Representative Will Ainsworth (R-22), who announced his candidacy for Lieutenant Governor.\n* Representative Mike Ball (R-10), who retired after 12 years in office.\n* Representative Ed Henry (R-23), who chose not to seek re-election.\n\n### Democrats\n\nA few Democratic incumbents also retired in 2022. These included:\n\n* Representative Chris England (D-67), who announced his candidacy for Alabama Secretary of State.\n* Representative Neil Rafferty (D-54), who chose not to seek re-election.\n\n**Incumbents Defeated**\n\n### In Primary Elections\n\nSeveral incumbent Republicans were defeated in primary elections. These included:\n\n* Representative Steve Clouse (R-93), who was defeated by challenger Rhon Segers.\n* Representative Matt Simpson (R-94), who was defeated by challenger Steve Dean.\n\n### Democrats\n\nOne incumbent Democrat was defeated in a primary election. This included:\n\n* Representative Patricia Todd (D-54), who was defeated by challenger Rep. Neil Rafferty's Democratic primary opponent, Marc McClure, but later challenged in the Democratic runoff to no avail.\n\n**Predictions**\n\nPre-election polls and analysts predicted a strong Republican victory in the Alabama House of Representatives election. The Republican Party was expected to maintain its majority, and some analysts even predicted that the party could gain additional seats.\n\n**Results**\n\nThe final results of the election saw the Republican Party maintaining its majority in the Alabama House of Representatives. Republicans won 77 seats, while Democrats won 28 seats.\n\n**Closest Races**\n\nSome of the closest races in the election were:\n\n* District 22: Republican Will Ainsworth's seat was won by Republican candidate, Bubba Bussey.\n* District 10: Republican Mike Ball's seat was won by Republican candidate, Thomas Jackson.\n* District 23: Republican Ed Henry's seat was won by Republican candidate, Tim Wadsworth.\n\n**Detailed Results**\n\n### Overview\n\nThe election saw a total of 105 seats up for election.

The war has seen the involvement of various armed groups, including the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), and several rebel factions.\n\nBackground\n\n### War in Darfur and the formation of the RSF\n\nThe conflict in Darfur, which began in 2003, was a major factor in the formation of the RSF. The RSF, led by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (also known as Hemedti), was initially a paramilitary group that fought against the rebel groups in Darfur. The RSF's role in the conflict in Darfur was marked by reports of human rights abuses and violence against civilians.\n\n### Political transition\n\nIn 2019, a popular uprising in Sudan led to the ousting of long-time leader Omar al-Bashir. A transitional government was established, with a military-civilian council heading the country. However, the council's power-sharing agreement was short-lived, as the military took control in a coup in October 2021.\n\n### Origins of the SPLM-N and the SLM\n\nThe Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N) and the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM) are two major rebel groups that have been involved in the conflict in Sudan. The SPLM-N, led by Abdelaziz al-Hilu, was formed in 2011 and has been fighting against the government in the states of Blue Nile and South Kordofan. The SLM, led by Abdul Wahid al-Nur, was formed in 2006 and has been fighting against the government in the state of Darfur.\n\n### Prelude\n\nIn the months leading up to the start of the war, tensions between the RSF and the SAF had been escalating. The RSF, which had become a powerful force in the country, had been pushing for greater autonomy and control over the country's wealth. The SAF, on the other hand, had been trying to maintain its control over the country's military and economy.\n\nCourse of the war\n\n### April–May 2023\n\n#### Battle of Khartoum\n\nThe war began in April 2023, with clashes between the RSF and the SAF in the capital city of Khartoum. The RSF, which had been building up its forces in the city, launched a surprise attack on the SAF's military headquarters. The SAF responded with heavy artillery fire, but the RSF was able to hold its ground.\n\n#### Treaty of Jeddah\n\nIn May 2023, the RSF and the SAF signed a temporary ceasefire agreement in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The agreement, which was brokered by the Saudi government, called for a halt to the fighting and the establishment of a joint committee to oversee the implementation of the agreement.\n\n### June–September 2023\n\n#### Continued fighting in Khartoum\n\nDespite the ceasefire agreement, fighting continued in Khartoum, with both sides suffering heavy losses. The RSF launched a series of attacks on SAF positions in the city, while the SAF responded with artillery fire.\n\n#### Diplomatic efforts\n\nThe international community, led by the African Union and the United Nations, launched a series of diplomatic efforts to bring an end to the conflict. The efforts included mediation talks between the RSF and the SAF, as well as the deployment of peacekeeping forces to the country.\n\n#### SPLM-N (Al-Hilu) involvement\n\nIn June 2023, the SPLM-N, led by Abdelaziz al-Hilu, announced that it would be joining the conflict on the side of the RSF. The SPLM-N's involvement in the conflict marked a significant escalation of the war.\n\n#### Darfur front\n\nThe conflict also spread to the state of Darfur, where the SLM and other rebel groups had been fighting against the government for years. The RSF launched a series of attacks on SLM positions in the state, while the SLM responded with guerrilla warfare.\n\n### October–December 2023\n\n#### SAF collapse in Darfur\n\nIn October 2023, the SLM launched a major attack on SAF positions in the state of Darfur, which led to the collapse of the SAF's military presence in the state. The collapse marked a significant defeat for the SAF and a major victory for the SLM.\n\n#### Peace negotiations stall\n\nIn November 2023, the RSF and the SAF launched peace negotiations in the Sudanese capital of Khartoum, but the talks stalled after several days. The talks, which were mediated by the African Union, were unable to reach an agreement on key issues, including the distribution of power and the role of the RSF in the government.\n\n#### RSF Crossing of the Nile\n\nIn December 2023, the RSF launched a major operation to cross the Nile River and capture the SAF's military headquarters in the city of Omdurman. The operation marked a significant escalation of the war and led to the capture of key SAF positions in the city.\n\nJanuary–April 2024\n\n### Hemedti travels abroad\n\nIn January 2024, RSF leader Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (also known as Hemedti) traveled to several countries in the region, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Hemedti's trip was seen as an attempt to secure international support for the RSF's military campaign.\n\n### Fighting in Kordofan and Gezira\n\nIn February 2024, fighting broke out in the states of Kordofan and Gezira, where the SPLM-N and other rebel groups had been fighting against the SAF for years. The RSF launched a series of attacks on SAF positions in the states, while the SAF responded with artillery fire.\n\n### SAF gains in Omdurman\n\nIn March 2024, the SAF launched a major operation to retake the city of Omdurman, which had been captured by the RSF in December 2023. The operation marked a significant victory for the SAF and led to the recapture of key RSF positions in the city.\n\nApril 2024–present\n\n### Fighting in Darfur\n\nIn April 2024, fighting broke out in the state of Darfur, where the SLM and other rebel groups had been fighting against the government for years. The RSF launched a series of attacks on SLM positions in the state, while the SLM responded with guerrilla warfare.\n\n### Fighting in Kordofan\n\nIn May 2024, fighting broke out in the state of Kordofan, where the SPLM-N and other rebel groups had been fighting against the SAF for years. The RSF launched a series of attacks on SAF positions in the state, while the SAF responded with artillery fire.\n\n### Fighting along the Nile\n\nIn June 2024, fighting broke out along the Nile River, where the RSF and the SAF had been clashing for years. The RSF launched a series of attacks on SAF positions along the river, while the SAF responded with artillery fire.\n\n### SAF offensives\n\nIn July 2024, the SAF launched a series of offensives against the RSF in several states, including Kordofan and Gezira. The offensives marked a significant escalation of the war and led to the capture of key RSF positions in th", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The draft took place on April 27-29, 2023, at the Caesars Forum in Paradise, Nevada. The event was the first to be held at Caesars Forum, which replaced the previous host of the draft, the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans.\n\n**Host City and Events**\n\nThe 2023 NFL draft was hosted by the city of Las Vegas, Nevada, for the first time in the event's history. The Caesars Forum, a convention center located on the Las Vegas Strip, served as the main venue for the draft. The area surrounding the forum was transformed into a draft festival, featuring various NFL-themed activities and attractions. The festival was free and open to the public, with attendees able to watch the draft on large screens and interact with NFL players and alumni.\n\nThe NFL hosted several events in the days leading up to the draft, including the 2023 NFL Draft Experience, a fan festival featuring interactive exhibits and experiences. The event also included the NFL Draft Red Carpet, a procession of players and coaches walking the red carpet to promote the draft.\n\n**Player Selections**\n\nThe 2023 NFL draft consisted of seven rounds, with each team selecting a player in each round. The draft order was determined by the teams' record in the 2022 NFL season, with the worst team selecting first and the Super Bowl champion selecting last. The Kansas City Chiefs, who won Super Bowl LVII, selected last in the draft.\n\nThe first player selected in the draft was C.J. Stroud, a quarterback from Ohio State, who was chosen by the Houston Texans with the first overall pick. Stroud was widely regarded as one of the top quarterback prospects in the draft, and his selection was seen as a major surprise by many scouts and analysts.\n\nThroughout the draft, teams selected a wide range of players, including quarterbacks, running backs, wide receivers, and defensive linemen. The top 10 picks in the draft were:\n\n* 1. Houston Texans - C.J. Stroud (QB, Ohio State)\n* 2. Arizona Cardinals - Jaxon Smith-Njigba (WR, Ohio State)\n* 3.

Green Bay Packers - Jordan Addison (WR, USC)\n\n**Notable Undrafted Players**\n\nSeveral players who were not selected in the 2023 NFL draft went on to sign with teams as undrafted free agents. Some notable undrafted players include:\n\n* Jordy Sandberg, a quarterback from the University of Minnesota, who signed with the Los Angeles Chargers.\n* Isaiah Likely, a tight end from the University of South Carolina, who signed with the Los Angeles Rams.\n* Jalen Thompson, a safety from the University of Washington, who signed with the New England Patriots.\n* Tariq Carpenter, a linebacker from the University of North Carolina, who signed with the Denver Broncos.\n\n**Trades**\n\nSeveral trades occurred during the 2023 NFL draft, with teams swapping picks and players to acquire players they wanted. Some notable trades include:\n\n* The New York Giants traded their third-round pick (82nd overall) to the Las Vegas Raiders in exchange for wide receiver Mecole Hardman.\n* The Seattle Seahawks traded their fifth-round pick (155th overall) to the Kansas City Chiefs in exchange for linebacker Willie Gay.\n* The Green Bay Packers traded their sixth-round pick (191st overall) to the San Francisco 49ers in exchange for wide receiver Jauan Jennings.\n\n**2020 Resolution JC-2A Selections**\n\nThe 2023 NFL draft also featured several players who were selected under the 2020 Resolution JC-2A, a rule change that allowed teams to select players who were previously not eligible for the draft. Some notable players selected under the JC-2A include:\n\n* Drake Maye, a quarterback from North Carolina, who was selected by the Pittsburgh Steelers in the fifth round (165th overall).\n* David Ojabo, a linebacker from Michigan, who was selected by the Baltimore Ravens in the fifth round (167th overall).\n* Travis Hunter, a wide receiver from Jackson State, who was selected by the Cincinnati Bengals in the fifth round (170th overall).\n\n**Supplemental Draft**\n\nThe 2023 NFL supplemental draft was held on July 12, 2023, and featured several players who were not selected in the regular draft. Some notable players selected in the supplemental draft include:\n\n* Jalen Carter, a defensive tackle from Georgia, who was selected by the Kansas City Chiefs.\n* Noah Sewell, a linebacker from Oregon, who was selected by the New Orleans Saints.\n* Daniel Joseph, a defensive end from Kansas State, who was selected by the Chicago Bears.\n\n**Notes**\n\nThe 2023 NFL draft was the first to be held at Caesars Forum, a convention center located on the Las Vegas Strip. The event was attended by thousands of fans and featured several NFL-themed activities and attractions. The draft was broadcast on television and streamed online, with millions of viewers tuning in to watch the selections.\n\nThe 2023 NFL draft saw several records broken, including the most players selected from the same school (Ohio State) and the most players selected in the first round (10). The draft also saw several trades and signings, with teams swapping picks and players to acquire players they wanted.\n\n**Summary**\n\nThe 2023 NFL draft was a major event in the world of football, with thousands of fans attending the draft festival and millions more watching on television and online.

Chase, a Federalist and a strong supporter of the Adams administration, was impeached by the House of Representatives on charges of \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" related to his conduct during the trial of two men accused of treason.\n\n**Background**\n\nSamuel Chase was born in 1741 in Maryland and graduated from Yale College in 1758. He served in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War and later became a lawyer. Chase was appointed to the Supreme Court by President George Washington in 1796 and served until his impeachment in 1804.\n\n**Impeachment in the House of Representatives**\n\nThe impeachment process against Chase began in January 1804, when the House of Representatives voted to launch an impeachment inquiry into alleged misconduct by Chase during his involvement in the treason trials of Aaron Burr and James Callender. The inquiry was sparked by complaints from Chase's opponents, who accused him of bias and of trying to intimidate witnesses.\n\n**Vote to Launch Impeachment Inquiry**\n\nOn January 13, 1804, the House of Representatives voted 73-32 to launch an impeachment inquiry into Chase's conduct. The resolution stated that Chase had \"carried his judicial duties to a high and unwarrantable pitch,\" and that his actions had \"tended to bring the administration of justice into contempt.\"\n\n**Early Inquiry Developments**\n\nThe impeachment inquiry was led by a special committee of the House of Representatives, which began holding hearings in February 1804. The committee heard testimony from witnesses, including several of Chase's colleagues on the Supreme Court, who described his behavior during the treason trials.\n\n**Adoption of Impeachment Resolution**\n\nOn March 12, 1804, the House of Representatives voted 73-32 to adopt a resolution impeaching Chase on eight counts of \"high crimes and misdemeanors.\" The resolution accused Chase of making inflammatory speeches, of trying to intimidate witnesses, and of using his power as a judge to advance the interests of the Federalist Party.\n\n**Subsequent Months of Inquiry**\n\nOver the next several months, the impeachment inquiry continued, with the House committee hearing additional testimony and gathering evidence. In August 1804, the committee voted to recommend that Chase be impeached on all eight counts.\n\n**Adoption of Articles of Impeachment**\n\nOn August 13, 1804, the House of Representatives voted 73-32 to adopt the articles of impeachment against Chase. The articles charged Chase with:\n\n* Article I: Making inflammatory speeches during the treason trials\n* Article II: Trying to intimidate witnesses during the treason trials\n* Article III: Using his power as a judge to advance the interests of the Federalist Party\n* Article IV: Making biased statements during the treason trials\n* Article V: Trying to influence the testimony of witnesses\n* Article VI: Making remarks that were detrimental to the administration of justice\n* Article VII: Using his power as a judge to intimidate witnesses\n* Article VIII: Committing other high crimes and misdemeanors\n\n**Vote Overview**\n\nThe impeachment vote was largely along party lines, with the Federalists voting in favor of impeachment and the Republicans voting against. The resolution adopted by the House of Representatives was signed by 73 members, while 32 members voted against it.\n\n**Appointment of House Managers**\n\nOn January 23, 1805, the House of Representatives appointed five managers to present the case against Chase in the Senate trial. The managers were:\n\n* Richard M. Johnson of Kentucky\n* John M. Clayton of Delaware\n* Gabriel Duvall of Maryland\n* William Branch Giles of Virginia\n* Philip P. Barbour of Virginia\n\n**Senate Trial**\n\nThe Senate trial of Chase began on February 4, 1805. The trial was presided over by Vice President Aaron Burr, who also served as the chief justice of the Senate.\n\n**Officers of the Trial**\n\nThe officers of the trial were:\n\n* Vice President Aaron Burr, chief justice of the Senate\n* Stephen R. Bradley of Vermont, president pro tempore of the Senate\n* John Armstrong of Pennsylvania, secretary of the Senate\n\n**Rules of the Trial**\n\nThe Senate adopted rules for the trial, which included:\n\n* Rule 1: The trial would be conducted in accordance with the Constitution and the laws of the United States.\n* Rule 2: The managers would present their case first, followed by the defense.\n* Rule 3: The trial would be open to the public.\n\n**Start of the Proceedings**\n\nThe trial began with the reading of the articles of impeachment, followed by the managers' opening statement. The managers argued that Chase had committed high crimes and misdemeanors by making inflammatory speeches, trying to intimidate witnesses, and using his power as a judge to advance the interests of the Federalist Party.\n\n**Decoration and Arrangement of the Senate Chamber**\n\nThe Senate Chamber was decorated with flags and other symbols of the government. The chamber was arranged with the senators seated in their usual places, with the managers and defense counsel seated at a table near the front of the chamber.\n\n**Pleading Phase**\n\nThe pleading phase of the trial began on February 4, 1805, and lasted for several days. During this time, the managers presented their case, calling witnesses and introducing evidence. The defense counsel also presented their case, calling witnesses and introducing evidence.\n\n**Argument Phase**\n\nThe argument phase of the trial began on February 11, 1805, and lasted for several days. During this time, the managers and defense counsel presented their closing arguments.\n\n**Prosecution's Presentation**\n\nThe managers presented their case in two parts. The first part focused on Chase's conduct during the treason trials, while the second part focused on his alleged bias and intimidation of witnesses.\n\n**Defense's Presentation**\n\nThe defense counsel argued that Chase had committed no high crimes or misdemeanors, and that his conduct during the treason trials was justified. They also argued that the managers had failed to prove their case and that the impeachment was a political witch hunt.\n\n**Closing Remarks**\n\nThe managers and defense counsel presented their closing arguments on February 16, 1805. The managers argued that Chase had committed high crimes and misdemeanors and that he should be removed from office. The defense counsel argued that Chase had committed no high crimes or misdemeanors and that he should be acquitted.\n\n**Verdict**\n\nOn March 1, 1805, the Senate voted on the articles of impeachment. Chase was acquitted on all eight counts, with 19 senators voting in favor of conviction and 20 senators voting in favor of acquittal.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe acquittal of Chase was seen as a major victory for the Federalist Party, which had come under attack from the Republicans. However, the trial had also exposed deep divisions within the government and had raised questions about the power of the judiciary.\n\n**Immediate Aftermath**\n\nThe immediate aftermath of the trial saw a increase in tensions between the Federalists and Republicans. The Federalists saw the acquittal of Chase as a vindication of their party's principles, while the Republicans saw it as a threat to the rule of law.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nThe impeachment trial of Samuel Chase had a lasting impact on the government and the judiciary. It established the principle of judicial independence and highlighted the importance of the judiciary in the democratic process. The trial also raised questions about the power of the executive and legislative branches and the role of the judiciary in checking their power.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

This article explores the various ways in which Mount Rushmore has been represented in popular culture.\n\n**Reasons for Popularity**\n\nMount Rushmore's popularity can be attributed to its unique design, which represents the foundational principles of American democracy. The monument's four presidents were chosen for their significant contributions to the country's history and development. Washington represents the birth of the nation, Jefferson the expansion of the country, Roosevelt the growth of industry, and Lincoln the preservation of the Union. This symbolic representation has captivated the imagination of audiences, making Mount Rushmore a cultural touchstone.\n\n**Common Themes**\n\nMount Rushmore has been featured in various forms of media, often exploring themes related to the monument's significance and symbolism.\n\n### **Destruction**\n\nIn popular culture, Mount Rushmore has been depicted as a target for destruction or alteration in several works. This theme allows creators to explore the consequences of altering or destroying a national symbol. For example, in the 1983 film _The A-Team_, the characters plan to destroy Mount Rushmore to distract from their true mission. Similarly, in the 2006 video game _Deus Ex: Invisible War_, the player must prevent a group of terrorists from blowing up the monument.\n\n### **Alterations and Additions to the Faces**\n\nThe idea of altering or adding to the faces on Mount Rushmore has also been explored in popular culture. In the 2011 film _The Muppets_, the villainous character Tex Richman plans to blow up the monument to use the explosives to mine for gold. However, the Muppets intervene, and the faces are temporarily replaced with the likenesses of Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy. This theme allows creators to comment on the cultural significance of Mount Rushmore and the consequences of tampering with it.\n\n**Imitations of the Style**\n\nMount Rushmore's design has inspired numerous imitations and parodies in popular culture. The monument's iconic style has been used to create similar sculptures and monuments, often with humorous or satirical intentions.\n\n### **Major Portrayals**\n\nMount Rushmore has been featured in several notable films and television shows, often serving as a backdrop for the plot or as a symbol of American culture.\n\n#### **In North by Northwest**\n\nIn Alfred Hitchcock's 1959 film _North by Northwest_, Mount Rushmore is featured prominently in the final scenes. The protagonist, Roger Thornhill (played by Cary Grant), is pursued by villains and finds himself standing in front of the monument, where he is mistaken for a government agent. This scene has become an iconic representation of Mount Rushmore in popular culture.\n\n**In Music**\n\nMount Rushmore has also been featured in various musical works, often as a symbol of American culture or as a backdrop for the lyrics.\n\n### **In Rock Music**\n\nIn the 1970s, the rock band Aerosmith wrote a song called \"Walk This Way,\" which features lyrics referencing Mount Rushmore. The song's music video features the band performing in front of the monument, highlighting its iconic status in American culture.\n\n### **In Hip-Hop**\n\nIn the 1990s, the hip-hop group Beastie Boys referenced Mount Rushmore in their song \"Rhymin' and Stealin'.\" The lyrics mention the monument as a symbol of American culture and history.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* **Mount Rushmore**\n* **United States Presidents**\n* **American Culture**\n* **Cultural Icon**", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

It is situated in the city's west end, on the shores of the Ottawa River, and is known for its unique history, architectural style, and natural beauty. This article provides an overview of the history, heritage, character, and notable residents of Britannia Village.\n\n**History**\n\n### Mill Town (1826–1887)\n\nThe history of Britannia Village begins in 1826, when a sawmill was built on the Ottawa River. The mill was operated by the Britannia Iron Works, a company that produced iron and steel products. The village that grew up around the mill was initially known as Britannia Iron Works, but was later renamed Britannia Village. During this period, the village was a small, rural community with a population of around 200 people.\n\nThe mill town era was marked by significant engineering feats, including the construction of a canal system to supply water to the mill and the creation of a series of locks to facilitate the transportation of goods. The village also became a hub for the production of lumber and other wood products.\n\n### Summer-Cottage Resort (1887–1960)\n\nIn the late 19th century, Britannia Village began to transform into a popular summer-cottage resort. The area's natural beauty, with its rolling hills, scenic views of the Ottawa River, and abundance of wildlife, made it an attractive destination for wealthy Ottawa residents. Many of these residents built large summer homes in the area, which became known for their grand architecture and well-manicured lawns.\n\nBritannia Amusement Park was a popular destination for summer visitors to the village. The park featured a variety of attractions, including a roller coaster, a Ferris wheel, and a number of other rides and games. The park was also home to a number of restaurants and other amenities, making it a popular spot for families and tourists.\n\n### Engineering Feats\n\nDuring the summer-cottage resort era, Britannia Village was the site of several significant engineering feats. One of the most notable was the construction of a series of locks to facilitate the transportation of goods and people between the village and the rest of the city. The locks were designed to allow vessels to pass between the Ottawa River and a series of canals and waterways that connected the village to the city.\n\nAnother significant engineering feat was the construction of a system of dams and reservoirs to supply water to the village and its summer homes. The system was designed to provide a reliable source of water for irrigation, drinking, and other purposes.\n\n### Britannia Amusement Park\n\nBritannia Amusement Park was a popular destination for summer visitors to Britannia Village. The park featured a variety of attractions, including a roller coaster, a Ferris wheel, and a number of other rides and games.

As the city of Ottawa expanded, many of the village's residents began to commute to the city for work, while still maintaining their summer homes in the village. The village's population began to grow, and many new homes were built to accommodate the influx of new residents.\n\nDuring this period, the village's economy began to shift away from industry and towards services. Many of the village's residents worked in the city, while others worked in the service industry or in small businesses.\n\n### Revitalization (since 2000)\n\nIn recent years, Britannia Village has undergone significant revitalization efforts. The village has invested in flood-proofing measures to protect against flooding, which has become a major concern in recent years.\n\nThe village has also undergone gentrification, with many of the old summer homes being renovated and sold to new owners. This has brought new investment and energy to the village, and has helped to revitalize its economy.\n\n**Heritage Buildings and Architectural Style**\n\nBritannia Village is known for its unique architectural style, which reflects its history as a summer-cottage resort. The village is home to many grand summer homes, built in a variety of architectural styles, including Arts and Crafts, Tudor Revival, and Georgian.\n\nMany of the village's homes have been designated as heritage buildings, and are protected by the Ontario Heritage Act. These homes are a testament to the village's rich history and architectural heritage.\n\n### Addresses of Buildings with Heritage Status\n\nThe following addresses are listed as heritage buildings in Britannia Village:\n\n* 123 Main Street\n* 456 Elm Street\n* 789 Oak Street\n\n### Heritage Attributes in Modern Residences\n\nMany modern residences in Britannia Village incorporate heritage attributes, such as:\n\n* Traditional architectural styles, such as Arts and Crafts and Tudor Revival\n* Historic details, such as wooden beams and stone fireplaces\n* Vintage design elements, such as stained glass windows and leaded glass doors\n\n**Character**\n\nBritannia Village is a charming and picturesque neighborhood, known for its natural beauty and unique character.

It was a school of thought that emphasized the importance of promoting order and stability through the use of laws, punishments, and bureaucratic systems.\n\n**Retrospective Current**\n\nLegalism was a response to the social and political turmoil of the Eastern Zhou period, during which the feudal system was in decline and the Zhou dynasty was weak. The Legalists criticized the Confucian emphasis on moral virtue and personal relationships, arguing that these values were insufficient to maintain social order.\n\n**Chapter 43 Ding Fa**\n\nOne of the earliest known Legalist texts is Chapter 43 of the \"Ding Fa\", a collection of sayings and teachings attributed to the legendary sage ruler, King Yu of Xia. This chapter is notable for its emphasis on the importance of rewards and punishments in maintaining social order.\n\n**Imperial Confucian Category**\n\nDespite its criticisms of Confucianism, Legalism was often categorized as a branch of Confucianism during the imperial era. This category was used to distinguish it from other schools of thought, such as Daoism and Mohism. However, this categorization is not universally accepted among scholars, who argue that Legalism is a distinct and separate school of thought.\n\n**Military Mobilization**\n\nThe Legalists were known for their emphasis on military mobilization and the importance of a strong military in maintaining social order. They believed that a strong military was necessary to suppress rebellion and maintain the unity of the state.\n\n**Sima Qian**\n\nSima Qian, a famous historian and scholar, wrote extensively on Legalism in his \"Records of the Grand Historian\". He argued that the Legalists were responsible for the development of many important institutions and policies during the Qin and Han dynasties.\n\n**Huang-Lao and Mawangdui**\n\nThe \"Huang-Lao\" was a school of thought that emerged during the Qin dynasty, which emphasized the importance of harmony between the ruler and his subjects. However, this school of thought is often seen as a form of Legalism, as it emphasized the importance of rewards and punishments in maintaining social order.\n\n**Huang-Lao and Laozi**\n\nSome scholars have argued that the Huang-Lao school of thought was influenced by the teachings of Laozi, the founder of Daoism. However, this idea is not universally accepted, and the relationship between the Huang-Lao and Laozi is still a matter of debate.\n\n**Shen Dao and Zhuangzi**\n\nShen Dao, a famous Legalist thinker, was influenced by the teachings of Zhuangzi, a famous Daoist philosopher. However, this influence is not universally accepted, and the relationship between Shen Dao and Zhuangzi is still a matter of debate.\n\n**Changing with the Times**\n\nThe Legalists believed that social and political institutions should be adapted to changing circumstances. They argued that the laws and institutions of the past should be modified to suit the needs of the present.\n\n**A.C. Graham**\n\nA.C. Graham, a famous scholar of Chinese philosophy, argued that the Legalists were a school of thought that emphasized the importance of the state and the ruler. He argued that the Legalists were responsible for the development of many important institutions and policies during the Qin and Han dynasties.\n\n**Confucian Influences**\n\nDespite its criticisms of Confucianism, Legalism was influenced by Confucian thought. The Legalists borrowed many Confucian concepts, such as the importance of moral virtue and personal relationships.\n\n**Shen Dao**\n\nShen Dao was a famous Legalist thinker who was influenced by Confucian thought. He argued that the ruler should be guided by moral virtue and that the laws and institutions of the state should be adapted to suit the needs of the people.\n\n**Xing-Ming and Wu Wei**\n\nThe Legalists believed in the importance of rewards and punishments in maintaining social order. They argued that individuals should be rewarded for good behavior and punished for bad behavior.\n\n**Han Feizi**\n\nHan Feizi, a famous Legalist thinker, argued that the ruler should be guided by the principle of \"wu wei\", or non-action. He believed that the ruler should allow the laws and institutions of the state to function without interference.\n\n**Daodejing 17**\n\nThe \"Daodejing\", a famous Daoist text, contains many passages that are relevant to Legalist thought. One of the most famous passages is chapter 17, which argues that the ruler should be guided by the principle of non-action.\n\n**School of Names**\n\nThe Legalists believed in the importance of language and the use of names to classify and categorize things. They argued that the use of names and categories was essential to maintaining social order.\n\n**Eradicating Punishments**\n\nThe Legalists believed that punishments should be used sparingly and that the use of punishments should be eradicated whenever possible. They argued that rewards and punishments should be used in a balanced and harmonious way.\n\n**Sources in Legalist Mythos**\n\nThe Legalists drew on many sources in developing their thought, including the teachings of Confucius, Laozi, and other famous philosophers.\n\n**Jia Yi (200–169 BCE)**\n\nJia Yi, a famous scholar and historian, wrote extensively on Legalism in his \"Essays on the Foreign Lands\". He argued that the Legalists were responsible for the development of many important institutions and policies during the Qin and Han dynasties.\n\n**Liu An (179–122 bce)**\n\nLiu An, a famous scholar and official, was influenced by Legalist thought. He argued that the ruler should be guided by the principle of non-action and that the laws and institutions of the state should be adapted to suit the needs of the people.\n\n**The Fa School**\n\nThe \"Fa School\" was a school of thought that emerged during the Han dynasty, which emphasized the importance of the rule of law and the use of punishments to maintain social order.\n\n**References**\n\n* Graham, A.C.

Located on the boundary with the Atlantic Ocean, the island is part of the Lesser Antilles island arc. The country is known for its natural beauty, with a lush tropical climate and diverse geography. Saint Lucia has a rich history, with evidence of human habitation dating back to the pre-Columbian era.\n\nEtymology\n-----------\n\nThe island's name is derived from the French phrase \"Sainte-Lucie,\" which means \"Saint Lucy.\" The name is attributed to the Catholic saint, Saint Lucy, who is revered for her patronage of the blind and the sick. The island's indigenous people, the Caribs, referred to the island as \"Hewanorra,\" which means \"land of the iguana.\"\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n### Pre-colonial period\n\nSaint Lucia was first inhabited by the Caribs, an indigenous people who migrated to the island from the mainland South America. The Caribs were skilled fishermen and traders, and their settlements were scattered throughout the island. The Caribs were known for their fierce resistance to colonization, and their settlements were often raided by European colonizers.\n\n### Early European period\n\nIn 1498, Christopher Columbus sighted the island during his second voyage to the New World. The French established the first European settlement on the island in 1624, and the French colonizers began to exploit the island's natural resources. The French also introduced the first African slaves to the island, who were brought to work on the plantations.\n\n### 18th and 19th centuries\n\nDuring the 18th and 19th centuries, Saint Lucia was a major producer of sugar, cotton, and other crops. The island's economy was heavily reliant on slavery, and the French colonizers continued to import African slaves to work on the plantations. The British captured the island from the French in 1796, and Saint Lucia became a British colony. The British abolished slavery in 1834, but the island's economy continued to struggle.\n\n### 20th century\n\nDuring the 20th century, Saint Lucia gained its independence from Britain on February 22, 1979. The country joined the Commonwealth of Nations and the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States.

The island is a volcanic island, with volcanic rocks making up a significant portion of its geology. The island's highest point is the Gros Piton, which rises to an elevation of 798 meters.\n\nGovernment\n---------\n\n### Administrative divisions\n\nSaint Lucia is divided into 11 administrative districts, each with its own administrative center. The districts are: Anse-la-Raye, Canaries, Castries, Choiseul, Gros-Islet, Laborie, Micoud, Praslin, Soufrière, Vieux-Fort, and Dennery.\n\n### Law and crime\n\nSaint Lucia has a relatively low crime rate compared to other countries in the region. However, the country still experiences a significant number of crimes, including theft, burglary, and robbery. The country has a strong police force and a well-developed judicial system.\n\n### Foreign relations\n\nSaint Lucia is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations and the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States. The country has diplomatic relations with over 100 countries around the world, including the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.\n\nEconomy\n-------\n\n### Tourism\n\nTourism is a significant contributor to Saint Lucia's economy, with the country attracting millions of visitors each year. The country's natural beauty, including its beaches, waterfalls, and rainforests, makes it a popular destination for tourists.\n\n### Agriculture\n\nAgriculture is also an important sector of Saint Lucia's economy, with the country producing a variety of crops, including bananas, avocados, and coconuts. The country's fertile soil and favorable climate make it an ideal location for farming.\n\n### Infrastructure\n\nSaint Lucia has invested heavily in infrastructure development, including the construction of roads, bridges, and ports. The country's main airport, Hewanorra International Airport, serves as a major hub for air travel in the region.\n\nDemographics\n------------\n\n### Ethnic groups\n\nThe population of Saint Lucia is predominantly of African descent, with a significant minority of people of European and Asian descent. The country has a relatively small indigenous population, consisting of the Carib people.\n\n### Languages\n\nThe official language of Saint Lucia is English, but the country also has a number of other languages spoken by its citizens, including French, Patois, and Creole.\n\n### Religion\n\nThe majority of Saint Lucians are Christian, with the largest denominations being the Anglican Church and the Roman Catholic Church. The country also has a small number of Muslims and Hindus.\n\n### Education\n\nEducation is highly valued in Saint Lucia, with a high literacy rate and a strong emphasis on education. The country has a number of schools and universities, including the University of the West Indies, which is one of the region's premier institutions of higher learning.\n\n### Healthcare\n\nSaint Lucia has a well-developed healthcare system, with a number of hospitals and medical facilities throughout the country.

The song was released on January 13, 2020, as the lead single from the album. It was written by Cyrus, along with Louis Schoorl, Michael Pollack, and Andrew Wyatt.\n\nProduction and release\n\nThe song was produced by Mike WiLL Made-It and Louis Schoorl, who also co-wrote the song with Cyrus. In an interview with Zane Lowe, Cyrus revealed that the song was inspired by her relationship with her ex-husband, Liam Hemsworth. However, the song's lyrics are more abstract and open to interpretation. Cyrus stated that the song is not just about her relationship with Hemsworth, but about the emotions and feelings that come with heartbreak.\n\nComposition\n\nThe song is an electro-pop ballad, featuring a minimalist instrumental arrangement with a focus on piano and strings. The song's tempo is moderate, with a tempo of 96 beats per minute. The song's key is C minor, and the time signature is 4/4.\n\nCritical reception\n\nFlowers received generally positive reviews from music critics. Some critics praised the song's nostalgic value, comparing it to Cyrus's earlier work, such as \"Party in the U.S.A.\" and \"The Climb.\" Others praised the song's production, noting its use of 80s-inspired synths and drum machines. However, some critics found the song's lyrics to be somewhat generic and clichéd.\n\nReviews\n\nRolling Stone praised the song, stating that it \"captures the pain and longing of a breakup with a precision that's both affecting and catchy.\" The Fader noted that the song's production is \"a deliberate nod to the raw, emotional sound of 80s pop.\" Billboard praised the song's \"timeless\" sound, noting that it \"could have been recorded in the 80s or the 90s.\"\n\nYear-end rankings\n\nFlowers was included on several year-end lists, including Billboard's Hot 100 year-end chart, where it ranked #53. Rolling Stone included the song on their list of the 100 best songs of 2020, where it ranked #35.\n\nCommercial performance\n\nFlowers was a commercial success, peaking at #1 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. It also reached #1 on the US Billboard Digital Song Sales chart and #1 on the US Billboard Adult Pop Airplay chart. The song has been certified multi-platinum by the RIAA.\n\nNorth America\n\nIn the US, Flowers debuted at #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, selling over 40,000 copies in its first week. The song also reached #1 on the US Billboard Digital Song Sales chart, selling over 30,000 digital copies in its first week. In Canada, the song peaked at #2 on the Canadian Hot 100 chart.\n\nInternational\n\nInternationally, Flowers peaked at #1 in the UK Singles Chart, becoming Cyrus's first #1 single in the UK since \"We Can't Stop\" in 2013. The song also reached #1 in Australia, becoming Cyrus's first #1 single in Australia since \"Wrecking Ball\" in 2013.\n\nMusic video\n\nThe music video for Flowers was directed by Cyrus and Patrick Hoelck. The video features Cyrus performing the song in a dimly lit room, surrounded by candles and flowers. The video also features footage of Cyrus in a lush green forest, surrounded by flowers and trees. The video has been viewed over 100 million times on YouTube.\n\nPerformances and usage\n\nFlowers was performed live by Cyrus on several occasions, including her appearance at the 2020 Grammy Awards, where she performed the song with a live band. The song was also performed by Cyrus on her Plastic Hearts Tour in 2020.\n\nUsage in media\n\nFlowers has been featured in several TV shows and movies, including The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Good Morning America, and The Late Late Show with James Corden. The song has also been used in several commercials, including a commercial for the clothing brand, Old Navy.\n\nImpact\n\nFlowers had a significant impact on the music industry, particularly in the pop genre. The song's nostalgic value and 80s-inspired production helped to revive the popularity of 80s music and influenced a new generation of pop artists. The song's lyrics and message also resonated with listeners, helping to cement Cyrus's status as a pop icon.\n\nLawsuit\n\nIn 2020, Cyrus was sued by a former employee who claimed that she had been subjected to a toxic work environment and was owed back pay. The lawsuit also claimed that Cyrus had used the song \"Flowers\" to promote her Plastic Hearts album without properly compensating the employee. The lawsuit was eventually settled out of court.\n\nCover versions\n\nSeveral artists have recorded cover versions of Flowers, including Ariana Grande, Katy Perry, and Taylor Swift. The song has also been covered by several other artists, including a a cappella groups and indie rock bands.\n\nAccolades\n\nFlowers won several awards, including the MTV Video Music Award for Best Pop Video and the iHeartRadio Music Award for Best Pop Song.
