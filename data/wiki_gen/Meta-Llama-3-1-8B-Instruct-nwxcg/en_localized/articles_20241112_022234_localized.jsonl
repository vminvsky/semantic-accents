He has been a prominent figure in Argentine politics, advocating for free market economics and libertarian policies.\n\n**Early life and education**\n\nJavier Claudio Milei was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on February 22, 1970, to a family of Italian and Spanish descent. His father was a businessman, and his mother was a homemaker. Milei's early life was marked by a strong interest in economics, which he attributes to his father's influence. He studied economics at the University of Buenos Aires, graduating with a degree in 1994. During his university years, Milei became fascinated with the works of economists such as Milton Friedman and Friedrich Hayek, which would later shape his own economic ideology.\n\n**Economics career**\n\nMilei began his career as an economist in the 1990s, working as a financial analyst for several companies in Argentina. In 1997, he founded his own consulting firm, which specialized in economic research and analysis. Milei's firm quickly gained recognition for its innovative approaches to economic forecasting and policy analysis. Throughout the 2000s, Milei became a vocal critic of Argentina's economic policies, arguing that the country's heavy reliance on government intervention and protectionism was hindering economic growth.\n\n**Early political career**\n\nMilei's entry into politics began in the early 2000s, when he started writing articles and op-eds for various Argentine newspapers and magazines. His critiques of the government's economic policies resonated with many Argentines, who were growing increasingly frustrated with the country's economic stagnation. In 2009, Milei launched his own radio show, \"Milei en la mañana,\" which quickly became one of the most popular morning shows in Argentina. The show allowed Milei to reach a wider audience and further establish himself as a leading voice on economics and politics.\n\n### Rise to prominence\n\nMilei's rise to prominence as a politician began in 2013, when he founded the Libertarian Party of Argentina. The party's goal was to promote libertarian ideas and policies, which Milei believed were necessary to address Argentina's economic and social challenges. Milei's popularity grew rapidly, as he traveled the country giving lectures and speaking at conferences. His message of limited government, free markets, and individual freedom resonated with many Argentines who were disillusioned with the country's traditional politics.\n\n### 2021 legislative campaign\n\nIn 2021, Milei ran for a seat in the Argentine Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of Congress. His campaign focused on issues such as economic reform, tax reduction, and individual liberty. Milei's platform was a departure from the traditional left-right politics of Argentina, and his message of change resonated with many voters. Although he ultimately lost the election, Milei's campaign marked a turning point in his career, as he began to gain national recognition as a leading figure in Argentine politics.\n\n**National deputyship**\n\nIn 2023, Milei was elected as a National Deputy, representing the Libertarian Party of Argentina. As a deputy, he played a key role in shaping the country's legislative agenda, advocating for policies that promoted economic freedom and individual liberty. Milei's leadership in the Chamber of Deputies helped to establish him as a leading figure in Argentine politics, and he began to be seen as a potential candidate for higher office.\n\n**2023 Argentine general election**\n\nIn 2023, Milei announced his candidacy for President of Argentina, running on a platform of economic reform, tax reduction, and individual liberty. His campaign was marked by controversy, as he faced criticism from traditional politicians and the media for his unconventional approach to politics. Despite these challenges, Milei's message of change resonated with many Argentines, who were disillusioned with the country's economic and social stagnation.\n\n### 2023 presidential campaign\n\nMilei's presidential campaign was marked by a series of debates and rallies, in which he advocated for his platform of economic reform and individual liberty. His campaign was also marked by controversy, as he faced criticism from traditional politicians and the media for his unconventional approach to politics. Despite these challenges, Milei's message of change resonated with many Argentines, who were disillusioned with the country's economic and social stagnation.\n\n### Primary and general elections\n\nIn the primary elections, Milei won the Libertarian Party nomination, defeating his rival, Sergio Massa. In the general election, Milei faced off against the Peronist candidate, Alberto Fernández. Despite being the underdog, Milei's message of change resonated with many Argentines, who were disillusioned with the country's economic and social stagnation. On December 10, 2023, Milei won the presidential election, marking a historic victory for the Libertarian Party of Argentina.\n\n**Presidency (2023–present)**\n\n### Inauguration\n\nMilei was inaugurated as President of Argentina on December 10, 2023, in a ceremony held at the Congress Building in Buenos Aires. The inauguration marked a new era in Argentine politics, as Milei became the first Libertarian President in the country's history.\n\n### First acts\n\nAs President, Milei has taken a series of bold actions to address Argentina's economic and social challenges. He has implemented a series of economic reforms, including a significant reduction in taxes and a liberalization of trade policies. Milei has also taken steps to promote individual liberty, including the legalization of same-sex marriage and the decriminalization of marijuana.\n\n### Economy\n\nMilei's economic policies have been marked by a strong focus on free market principles, including the reduction of government intervention and the promotion of private enterprise. He has also taken steps to address Argentina's chronic inflation, including the implementation of a new currency and the creation of a central bank. Despite these challenges, Milei's economic policies have been met with widespread approval from Argentines, who are hopeful that the country's economic stagnation will come to an end.\n\n**Political positions**\n\nMilei's political positions are shaped by his libertarian ideology, which emphasizes individual liberty, free markets, and limited government. He has been a vocal critic of government intervention and protectionism, arguing that these policies have hindered economic growth and individual freedom. Milei has also been a strong advocate for individual rights, including the right to bear arms and the right to same-sex marriage.\n\n**Public image**\n\nMilei's public image is that of a bold and unconventional politician who is unafraid to challenge the status quo. He has been praised for his honesty and integrity, as well as his commitment to his ideas. Milei's message of change has resonated with many Argentines, who are disillusioned with the country's economic and social stagnation.\n\n**Personal life**\n\nMilei was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on February 22, 1970. He is married to a woman named Adriana, and they have two children together. Milei is a practicing Catholic and has been open about his faith. He is also a passionate advocate for animal rights and has been involved in various charitable organizations.\n\n**Electoral history**\n\n### Executive\n\n* 2023: Elected President of Argentina\n* 2021: Ran for a seat in the Argentine Chamber of Deputies\n\n### Legislative\n\n* 2023: Elected National Deputy\n\n**Radio**\n\nMilei has hosted his own radio show, \"Milei en la mañana,\" since 2009.

{"title": "Indeterminacy_debate_in_legal_theory", "content": "#See also\n#Bibliography\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Indeterminacy Debate in Legal Theory**\n\nThe indeterminacy debate in legal theory is a longstanding discussion among jurists and scholars regarding the extent to which the law is determinate, or certain, and the role of interpretation in shaping legal outcomes. This debate has far-reaching implications for the understanding and application of law in various contexts, from constitutional interpretation to contract law.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe indeterminacy debate is a key aspect of contemporary legal theory, particularly within the realm of critical legal studies (CLS). CLS emerged in the 1960s as a reaction to the perceived rigidity and dogmatism of traditional legal scholarship. CLS scholars challenged the notion that law is a coherent and determinate system, instead arguing that it is inherently indeterminate and subject to multiple interpretations. This perspective has had a profound impact on the development of legal thought, influencing fields such as jurisprudence, philosophy of law, and legal philosophy.\n\n**Origins of the Debate**\n\nThe indeterminacy debate in legal theory has its roots in the early 20th century, with scholars such as Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. and Karl Llewellyn questioning the notion of an objective, determinate law. Holmes famously argued that \"the life of the law has not been logic; it has been experience,\" suggesting that the law is shaped by human experience and interpretation rather than abstract principles or rules. Llewellyn expanded on this idea, contending that the law is a \"social fact\" that is shaped by the interactions of individuals and groups.\n\n**Critical Legal Studies (CLS)**\n\nCLS, as a movement, emerged in the 1960s and 1970s, primarily in response to the perceived failure of traditional legal scholarship to address issues of social justice and inequality. CLS scholars, such as Duncan Kennedy, Roberto Mangabeira Unger, and Richard Posner, argued that the traditional legal system is inherently biased in favor of those in power and that the law is a tool of social control rather than a means of promoting justice. This perspective led to a focus on the indeterminacy of the law, with CLS scholars arguing that the law is inherently subjective and open to multiple interpretations.\n\n**Indeterminacy Theories**\n\nSeveral theories have been developed to explain the indeterminacy of the law. These theories include:\n\n### **Descriptive Indeterminacy**\n\nDescriptive indeterminacy refers to the idea that the law is inherently ambiguous and open to multiple interpretations. This perspective argues that the language of the law is often unclear and that the meaning of legal texts is subject to interpretation.\n\n### **Prescriptive Indeterminacy**\n\nPrescriptive indeterminacy, on the other hand, refers to the idea that the law is not only ambiguous but also inherently unstable and subject to change. This perspective argues that the law is shaped by social and cultural forces, rather than fixed principles or rules.\n\n### **Postmodernism and Indeterminacy**\n\nPostmodernism has had a significant impact on the indeterminacy debate, with postmodern scholars arguing that the law is a product of language and power rather than objective reality. Postmodernism challenges the notion of an objective, determinate law, instead arguing that the law is a social construct that is subject to multiple interpretations.\n\n**Implications of the Indeterminacy Debate**\n\nThe indeterminacy debate has far-reaching implications for the understanding and application of law in various contexts. Some of the key implications include:\n\n*   **Challenge to Traditional Legal Scholarship**: The indeterminacy debate challenges the notion that law is a coherent and determinate system, instead arguing that it is inherently indeterminate and subject to multiple interpretations.\n*   **Increased Focus on Interpretation**: The indeterminacy debate highlights the importance of interpretation in shaping legal outcomes, emphasizing the need for critical and nuanced approaches to legal analysis.\n*   **Recognition of Power Dynamics**: The indeterminacy debate recognizes the role of power dynamics in shaping the law, highlighting the need for a more nuanced understanding of the social and cultural forces that shape legal outcomes.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe indeterminacy debate in legal theory is a complex and multifaceted discussion that has far-reaching implications for the understanding and application of law. The debate highlights the importance of interpretation in shaping legal outcomes, recognizes the role of power dynamics in shaping the law, and challenges the notion of an objective, determinate law. As the indeterminacy debate continues to evolve, it is likely to have a profound impact on the development of legal thought and the application of law in various contexts.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

From its earliest beginnings to the present day, rock climbing has undergone significant transformations, shaped by advances in technology, changes in social attitudes, and the contributions of dedicated climbers.\n\n## Origins\n\nThe origins of rock climbing date back to ancient civilizations, where people would ascend rocks for spiritual, cultural, or practical purposes. In ancient Greece, for example, people would climb rocks to reach temples or to perform rituals. Similarly, in the Himalayas, the native population would climb peaks as a form of spiritual exercise.\n\n## 19th century\n\nThe modern era of rock climbing began in the 19th century, when mountaineering emerged as a distinct activity. In 1786, the first ascent of Mont Blanc, the highest peak in the Alps, was accomplished by Jacques Balmat and Michel-Gabriel Paccard. This achievement sparked a new era of mountaineering, with climbers seeking to conquer the highest peaks.\n\n## 1900s\n\nThe early 20th century saw the rise of rock climbing as a competitive sport. In 1905, the first rock climbing competition was held in the Swiss Alps, and the first climbing clubs were established in Europe and North America. Climbers such as Albert Mummery and Vittorio Sella demonstrated remarkable skill and endurance on the world's most challenging peaks.\n\n## 1910s\n\nThe 1910s saw significant advances in climbing technology, with the introduction of the first climbing ropes, harnesses, and carabiners. This equipment enabled climbers to tackle more challenging routes and paved the way for the development of modern climbing techniques.\n\n## 1920s\n\nThe 1920s were marked by the emergence of rock climbing as a distinct discipline. The first rock climbing competitions were held in the United States, and the first climbing guidebooks were published. Climbers such as Paul Preuss and Fritz Kasparek made significant contributions to the sport, developing new techniques and pushing the boundaries of what was thought possible.\n\n## 1930s\n\nThe 1930s saw the rise of the Golden Age of Alpinism, with climbers such as Gaston Rébuffat and Lino Lacedelli achieving remarkable feats on the world's most challenging peaks. The first ascent of K2, the second-highest peak in the world, was accomplished in 1954 by an Italian team led by Achille Compagnoni and Lino Lacedelli.\n\n## 1940s\n\nThe 1940s were marked by the development of new climbing techniques and the establishment of the first climbing schools. The first rock climbing school was established in the United States in 1946, and the first climbing courses were offered in Europe and North America.\n\n## 1950s\n\nThe 1950s saw significant advances in climbing technology, with the introduction of the first nylon ropes, helmets, and crampons. This equipment enabled climbers to tackle more challenging routes and paved the way for the development of modern climbing techniques.\n\n## 1960s\n\nThe 1960s were marked by the emergence of free climbing, a style of climbing that emphasizes self-belaying and the use of minimal equipment. Climbers such as Lynn Hill and Royal Robbins developed new techniques and pushed the boundaries of what was thought possible.\n\n## 1970s\n\nThe 1970s saw the rise of bouldering, a style of climbing that emphasizes short, powerful movements on short walls. Climbers such as Joe Kinder and Ron Kauk developed new techniques and pushed the boundaries of what was thought possible.\n\n## 1980s\n\nThe 1980s were marked by the development of new climbing equipment, including the first sport climbing ropes and harnesses. This equipment enabled climbers to tackle more challenging routes and paved the way for the development of modern climbing techniques.\n\n## 1990s\n\nThe 1990s saw the emergence of competition climbing, with the first World Cup climbing competition held in 1994. Climbers such as Tom Johnson and Lynn Hill dominated the sport, pushing the boundaries of what was thought possible.\n\n## 2000s\n\nThe 2000s were marked by the rise of sport climbing, a style of climbing that emphasizes short, powerful movements on short walls. Climbers such as Adam Ondra and Chris Sharma developed new techniques and pushed the boundaries of what was thought possible.\n\n## 2010s\n\nThe 2010s saw significant advances in climbing technology, with the introduction of the first 3D printing climbing holds and the development of new climbing software. Climbers such as Alex Honnold and Adam Ondra continued to push the boundaries of what was thought possible.\n\n## 2020s\n\nThe 2020s have seen the rise of competition climbing, with the Olympic Games adding climbing as a medal sport in 2020. Climbers such as Nathaniel Coleman and Janja Garnbret have dominated the sport, pushing the boundaries of what was thought possible.\n\n## See also\n\n* List of notable rock climbers\n* List of climbing routes\n* Rock climbing equipment\n* Climbing technique\n\n## Notes\n\n* The history of rock climbing is complex and multifaceted, and this article provides only a brief overview.\n* The development of rock climbing has been shaped by advances in technology, changes in social attitudes, and the contributions of dedicated climbers.\n* The first ascent of Mont Blanc, the highest peak in the Alps, was accomplished in 1786 by Jacques Balmat and Michel-Gabriel Paccard.\n* The first rock climbing competition was held in the Swiss Alps in 1905.\n* The first climbing clubs were established in Europe and North America in the early 20th century.\n* The first climbing guidebooks were published in the 1920s.\n* The first nylon ropes, helmets, and crampons were introduced in the 1950s.\n* The first sport climbing ropes and harnesses were introduced in the 1980s.\n* The first World Cup climbing competition was held in 1994.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

This ancient craft has been a vital part of human history, with evidence of pottery dating back to the Neolithic period, around 9000 BCE. Pottery has played a significant role in the development of civilizations, serving not only as a means of artistic expression but also as a practical tool for storing and cooking food, as well as a symbol of cultural and social status.\n\n**Main types**\n\nPottery can be broadly categorized into three main types: earthenware, stoneware, and porcelain.\n\n### Earthenware\n\nEarthenware is one of the oldest and most common types of pottery. It is made from a mixture of clay, water, and other minerals, and is fired at relatively low temperatures, typically between 1000°C to 1200°C. Earthenware is often used for functional items such as plates, bowls, and vases, and is prized for its rustic, earthy look and feel.\n\n### Stoneware\n\nStoneware is a type of pottery that is fired at higher temperatures than earthenware, typically between 1200°C to 1300°C. This process gives stoneware its characteristic strength, durability, and translucency. Stoneware is often used for items such as cups, bowls, and plates, and is prized for its sleek, modern appearance.\n\n### Porcelain\n\nPorcelain is a type of pottery that is fired at the highest temperatures of all, typically between 1300°C to 1400°C. This process gives porcelain its characteristic whiteness, translucency, and strength. Porcelain is often used for delicate, intricate items such as figurines, vases, and tea sets, and is prized for its elegant, refined appearance.\n\n**Archaeology**\n\nArchaeologists use a variety of techniques to analyze and date pottery, including fabric analysis.\n\n### Fabric analysis\n\nFabric analysis involves examining the physical properties of pottery, such as its texture, color, and mineral composition. This can provide valuable information about the type of clay used, the firing technique employed, and the age of the pottery.\n\n**Clay bodies and raw materials**\n\nClay bodies are the raw materials used to make pottery. These can include a variety of clays, such as kaolin, feldspar, and quartz, as well as other minerals and additives.\n\n**Production**\n\nThe production of pottery involves several stages, including shaping, drying, firing, and decorating.\n\n### Shaping\n\nShaping involves creating the desired form from the clay body. This can be done using a variety of techniques, such as hand-building, wheel-throwing, or slip-casting.\n\n### Drying\n\nDrying involves removing excess moisture from the clay to prevent cracking and warping during firing. This can be done using a variety of techniques, such as air drying or using a drying room.\n\n### Firing\n\nFiring involves heating the pottery to high temperatures to achieve the desired effects. This can be done using a variety of techniques, such as kiln firing or raku firing.\n\n#### Temperature\n\nThe temperature at which pottery is fired can have a significant impact on its final appearance and properties. Different temperatures can produce a range of effects, from delicate, translucent glazes to bold, vibrant colors.\n\n#### Atmosphere\n\nThe atmosphere in which pottery is fired can also have a significant impact on its final appearance and properties. Different atmospheres can produce a range of effects, from reducing conditions, which promote the formation of metal oxides, to oxidizing conditions, which promote the formation of glassy glazes.\n\n#### Methods\n\nThere are a variety of firing methods, each with its own unique characteristics and advantages. These include kiln firing, raku firing, salt glazing, and wood firing.\n\n#### Stages\n\nThe firing process typically involves a series of stages, each with its own unique characteristics and requirements. These stages may include a bisque firing, which serves to remove excess moisture and create a hard, brittle surface; a glaze firing, which serves to melt and set the glaze; and a final firing, which serves to achieve the desired level of hardness and durability.\n\n### Decorating\n\nDecorating involves adding color, texture, and other visual effects to the pottery. This can be done using a variety of techniques, such as glazing, underglazing, and overglazing.\n\n### Methods\n\nThere are a variety of decorating methods, each with its own unique characteristics and advantages. These include hand-painting, slip-trailing, and stamping.\n\n### Glazing\n\nGlazing involves applying a layer of glassy material to the pottery to create a range of effects, from delicate, translucent glazes to bold, vibrant colors.\n\n### Health and environmental issues\n\nThe production of pottery can have a range of health and environmental implications, from the use of toxic materials to the creation of waste and pollution.\n\n**History**\n\nThe history of pottery stretches back thousands of years, with evidence of pottery dating back to the Neolithic period, around 9000 BCE.\n\n### Early pottery\n\nEarly pottery was often made from a mixture of clay, water, and other minerals, and was fired at relatively low temperatures.

The case centered around allegations of domestic abuse made by actress Amber Heard against her ex-husband, actor Johnny Depp. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the case, from the background of the couple's relationship to the trial and its aftermath.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Depp and Heard's relationship\n\nJohnny Depp and Amber Heard met on the set of the 2011 film \"The Rum Diary,\" and began a romantic relationship in 2012. The couple got married in 2015, but their marriage was marked by allegations of domestic abuse and substance abuse. In 2016, Heard filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences.\n\n### Depp v News Group Newspapers Ltd\n\nIn 2018, Depp sued News Group Newspapers Ltd, the publisher of The Sun, for libel over an article that referred to him as a \"wife beater.\" Depp denied the allegations, but lost the case in 2020.\n\n### Heard's op-ed in The Washington Post\n\nIn December 2018, Heard wrote an op-ed for The Washington Post, in which she described herself as a survivor of domestic abuse. Although Depp was not named in the article, he claimed that it implied he was the abuser. Heard's article sparked a media frenzy, with many outlets speculating about the identity of her abuser.\n\n### Waldman's comments in the Daily Mail\n\nIn 2020, Depp's lawyer, Adam Waldman, made comments to the Daily Mail in which he suggested that Heard's op-ed was a \"hoax\" and that she had fabricated the allegations of abuse.\n\n**Civil action**\n\n### Pre-trial developments\n\nIn August 2020, Depp filed a civil lawsuit against Heard, alleging that she had defamed him in her op-ed. Heard filed a counterclaim, alleging that Depp had physically and emotionally abused her during their marriage.\n\n### Trial\n\nThe trial began on April 11, 2022, in Fairfax County Circuit Court, Virginia. The case was presided over by Judge Penney Azcarate.\n\n#### Opening statements\n\nDepp's lawyer, Camille Vasquez, argued that Heard's op-ed was a \"hoax\" and that she had fabricated the allegations of abuse. Heard's lawyer, Elaine Bredehoft, argued that Depp had a history of physical and emotional abuse, and that Heard had suffered significant harm as a result.\n\n#### Testimony\n\nThe trial featured testimony from numerous witnesses, including Depp, Heard, and several members of their inner circle. Depp testified that Heard had been the aggressor in their relationship, and that she had been the one to initiate violence. Heard testified that Depp had been the abuser, and that she had suffered significant physical and emotional harm as a result.\n\n#### Closing arguments\n\nDepp's lawyer, Camille Vasquez, argued that Heard's op-ed was a \"textbook example\" of defamation, and that she had intentionally implied that Depp was the abuser. Heard's lawyer, Elaine Bredehoft, argued that Depp's testimony was \"wholly unbelievable,\" and that he had a history of lying about his behavior.\n\n#### Verdict\n\nOn June 1, 2022, the jury delivered a verdict in favor of Johnny Depp, finding that Amber Heard had defamed him in her op-ed. The jury awarded Depp $10.35 million in damages.\n\n### Post-trial motions\n\nHeard's team filed a motion for a new trial, arguing that the jury's verdict was \"grossly inadequate\" and that the judge had made errors in the trial. Depp's team filed a motion to enforce the verdict, arguing that Heard's team was trying to \"undo\" the jury's decision.\n\n### Appeals, settlement and carrier lawsuit\n\nHeard's team filed an appeal of the verdict, arguing that the jury's decision was \"irreconcilably flawed.\" Depp's team filed a motion to dismiss the appeal, arguing that Heard's team was trying to \"appeal a victory.\" The two sides have also been embroiled in a carrier lawsuit, with Depp's insurance company suing Heard's team for damages.\n\n**Reactions**\n\n### Livestream\n\nThe trial was livestreamed on YouTube, with millions of viewers tuning in to watch the drama unfold.\n\n### Social media coverage\n\nThe trial was extensively covered on social media, with many outlets and individuals weighing in on the case.\n\n### Comments by juror\n\nOne of the jurors in the case spoke out after the verdict, saying that Depp's testimony was \"wholly believable\" and that Heard's team had presented \"no credible evidence\" of abuse.\n\n### The Washington Post\n\nThe Washington Post, which published Heard's op-ed, issued a statement saying that the verdict was \"a setback for survivors of domestic abuse\" and that \"the truth is that Amber Heard told her own story.\"\n\n### Commentary on verdict\n\nMany commentators have weighed in on the verdict, with some saying that it was a victory for free speech and others saying that it was a setback for survivors of domestic abuse.\n\n**Media coverage**\n\n### Film adaptation\n\nThe trial has been the subject of a film adaptation, with several production companies vying for the rights to tell the story.\n\n### Books\n\nSeveral books have been written about the case, including a memoir by Heard and a tell-all by Depp's former lawyer.\n\n### TV\n\nThe trial has been extensively covered on TV, with many outlets providing live coverage and analysis.\n\n### Podcast\n\nThe trial has been the subject of several podcasts, including a series by the popular true crime podcast, \"Crime Junkie.\"\n\n**See also**\n\n* Depp v News Group Newspapers Ltd\n* Heard's op-ed in The Washington Post\n* Waldman's comments in the Daily Mail\n\n**References**\n\n* This article does not include references.\n\n**External links**\n\n* Johnny Depp's official website\n* Amber Heard's official website\n* The Washington Post\n* The Daily Mail", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

As the world descends into chaos, a small group of experts, led by Brian Harper (Patrick Wilson), a NASA astronaut, and KC Houseman (Halle Berry), a former astronaut turned conspiracy theorist, team up to uncover the truth behind the moon's disappearance.\n\nAlong the way, they are joined by a young boy named Connor (John Bradley), who possesses a unique connection to the moon, and Jocinda Foley (Donald Sutherland), a NASA administrator who has been hiding a dark secret. As they navigate through the treacherous landscape of government cover-ups and conspiracies, they discover that the moon's disappearance is not a natural event, but rather a catastrophic failure of a massive alien structure that has been hidden beneath the moon's surface for centuries.\n\nAs the world teeters on the brink of collapse, Brian, KC, Connor, and Jocinda must work together to prevent a global catastrophe and find a way to restore the moon to its rightful place in the sky. Along the way, they encounter a group of rogue astronauts who are determined to exploit the situation for their own gain, and must use all their skills and ingenuity to outwit them and save the world.\n\nCast\n\n* Halle Berry as KC Houseman\n* Patrick Wilson as Brian Harper\n* John Bradley as Connor\n* Michael Peña as Ben Drask\n* Donald Sutherland as Jocinda Foley\n* Kelly Yu as Sasha\n* Charlie Plummer as Alexei Voinov\n* Dan Stevens as Spurgeon Tydis\n\nProduction\n\n### Development\n\nMoonfall was first conceived by Roland Emmerich in the early 2010s, as a response to the growing interest in space exploration and the increasing concern about the effects of climate change on the planet. Emmerich is a long-time advocate for the exploration of space and has always been fascinated by the mysteries of the universe. He saw the moon as a perfect symbol of the wonders of space and the importance of preserving the planet.\n\nEmmerich spent several years developing the script, working closely with his longtime collaborator, Harald Kloser, to create a story that would not only thrill audiences but also convey an important message about the importance of protecting the planet. During this time, Emmerich became increasingly fascinated with the idea of a moon catastrophe, where the moon suddenly disappears from the sky, causing widespread destruction and chaos on Earth.\n\n### Filming\n\nPrincipal photography for Moonfall began in June 2020, with a cast and crew of over 200 people working on location in Iceland and Canada. The film was shot using a combination of practical and CGI effects, with the production team using a state-of-the-art motion capture system to capture the performances of the actors.\n\nThe film's visual effects were handled by the team at Cinesite, who worked closely with Emmerich to bring the world of Moonfall to life. The team used a combination of 3D modeling, texturing, and animation to create the film's stunning visuals, including the massive alien structure that lies beneath the moon's surface.\n\n### Music\n\nThe music for Moonfall was composed by Thomas Wander, who has worked with Emmerich on several previous films, including Independence Day and The Day After Tomorrow. Wander's score for Moonfall is a sweeping epic that captures the sense of wonder and awe of the film's visuals. The score features a combination of orchestral and choral elements, with a number of memorable themes that are woven throughout the film.\n\nRelease\n\n### Home media\n\nMoonfall was released on digital platforms on March 1, 2022, followed by a Blu-ray and DVD release on March 15, 2022. The film has also been released in a number of different formats, including a 4K Ultra HD edition, which features a number of bonus features, including deleted scenes and behind-the-scenes footage.\n\nReception\n\n### Box office\n\nMoonfall was released in theaters on February 18, 2022, and quickly became a commercial success, grossing over $300 million worldwide in its opening weekend. The film went on to gross over $600 million worldwide, making it one of the highest-grossing films of the year.\n\n### Critical response\n\nMoonfall received mixed reviews from critics, with some praising the film's visuals and action sequences, while others criticized its plot and dialogue. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 44% approval rating, based on 234 reviews, with an average rating of 5.1/10. On Metacritic, the film has a score of 42 out of 100, based on 46 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.\n\nDespite the mixed reviews, Moonfall has been praised for its visuals and action sequences, with many critics noting that the film is a thrilling and entertaining ride.

The season premiered on February 23, 2023, and concluded on May 25, 2023.\n\n#Production\n\n##Development\n\nThe tenth season of Big Brother Canada was announced on January 10, 2023, with the release of a teaser trailer. The season was produced by Insight Productions and was broadcast on Global in Canada. The season's theme was \"Game Changers\", with a focus on the impact that houseguests can have on the game.\n\n##Prizes\n\nThe grand prize for the season was $750,000, a prize that was increased from the previous season's $375,000. The prize was awarded to the winner of the season, who was determined through a final vote by their fellow houseguests.\n\n##Production design\n\nThe tenth season of Big Brother Canada featured a new and redesigned Big Brother house. The house was located in a rural area outside of Toronto, and was surrounded by a large fence to prevent houseguests from escaping. The house itself was designed to be modern and sleek, with a focus on comfort and luxury.\n\n##International broadcast\n\nThe tenth season of Big Brother Canada was broadcast on Global in Canada, and was also streamed online through the Global TV app. The season was also broadcast in some other countries, including the United States, where it was streamed on the CBS All Access app.\n\n#HouseGuests\n\n##Guests\n\nThe tenth season of Big Brother Canada featured a total of 16 houseguests, who were divided into two teams of eight.

The insurance policy was a risk-free way for houseguests to avoid being evicted, and was a popular option among the houseguests.\n\n##Chain of Safety Double Eviction\n\nThe Chain of Safety Double Eviction was a twist in the season where houseguests could earn a safety net by winning certain challenges and competitions. The safety net would protect the houseguest from being evicted, and would also give them a chance to save another houseguest from being evicted.\n\n##Canada's Jury Vote\n\nThe Canada's Jury Vote was a twist in the season where the viewers at home could vote for the houseguests they wanted to see on the jury. The houseguests with the most votes would be added to the jury, and would have a say in the outcome of the season.\n\n#Summary\n\nThe tenth season of Big Brother Canada was a dramatic and action-packed season, with twists and turns that kept the houseguests on their toes. The season was marked by alliances and rivalries, as the houseguests competed against each other to win the grand prize. In the end, the winner of the season was determined through a final vote by the jury, and was crowned the Big Brother Canada champion.\n\n#Episodes\n\nThe tenth season of Big Brother Canada consisted of 16 episodes, which were broadcast on Global in Canada.

The election was held concurrently with the 2022 Texas Senate election and the 2022 United States presidential election.\n\nBackground\n----------\n\nThe 2022 Texas House of Representatives election was the second election in Texas held since the 2020 United States census, which led to the redrawing of the state's congressional and legislative districts. The election was held in a state where Republicans have maintained a majority in the House of Representatives since 2003.\n\nRedistricting\n------------\n\nFollowing the 2020 United States census, the Texas Legislature was required to redraw the state's congressional and legislative districts. The redistricting process was contentious, with Democrats and Republicans disagreeing on the new maps. The final maps were drawn by the Republican-dominated Legislature in 2021.\n\nSeats without incumbents\n-----------------------\n\nA total of 15 seats in the Texas House of Representatives were open due to the retirement of incumbent members. These seats were located in various parts of the state, including urban and rural areas.\n\nDouble-bunked incumbents\n------------------------\n\nIn some districts, two incumbent members were paired together, resulting in a highly competitive primary election. This was the case in districts 34, 45, and 83.\n\nRetirements\n------------\n\nThe following incumbent members of the Texas House of Representatives retired in 2022:\n\n* District 1: Representative

The rebellion was a confrontation between the colonial authorities and the gold miners, who were dissatisfied with the conditions and regulations imposed upon them. The event would ultimately lead to significant changes in the administration of Victoria and the rights of the people.\n\nOrigins in the Victorian gold rush\n--------------------------------\n\nIn 1851, the discovery of gold at Ballarat and Bendigo led to a mass influx of prospectors from all over the world. The goldfields were initially unregulated, with miners digging for gold in a largely free-for-all environment. However, as the number of miners increased, the colonial authorities began to impose regulations and taxes on the miners.\n\nProtests on the goldfields: 1851–1854\n-------------------------------------\n\nThe early gold miners were a mix of British, Irish, and American prospectors, who were largely dissatisfied with the conditions on the goldfields. The introduction of monthly mining taxes, licenses, and regulations led to widespread discontent among the miners. The colonial authorities, led by Lieutenant Governor Charles La Trobe, attempted to impose order on the goldfields through the establishment of gold commissioners and the implementation of laws.\n\n### La Trobe introduces monthly mining tax as protests begin\n\nIn 1852, La Trobe introduced a monthly mining tax, which further exacerbated tensions between the miners and the authorities. The tax was seen as an additional burden on the miners, who were already struggling to make a living in the harsh conditions of the goldfields.\n\n### First gold commissioner arrives in Ballarat\n\nIn 1853, the first gold commissioner, Captain Thomas Carr, arrived in Ballarat. Carr's presence was met with hostility from the miners, who saw him as a representative of the colonial authorities and an enforcer of the regulations.\n\n### Bendigo Petition and the Red Ribbon Movement\n\nIn 1854, the Bendigo Petition was presented to the Legislative Council, protesting the introduction of a new tax on the miners. The petition was signed by thousands of miners and was seen as a major challenge to the authority of the colonial government.\n\nThe Red Ribbon Movement, a protest movement led by the miners, emerged in response to the introduction of the new tax. The movement was marked by the wearing of red ribbons by the miners, who saw themselves as fighting for their rights and freedoms.\n\n### Legislative Council calls for Commission of Inquiry\n\nIn response to the Bendigo Petition and the Red Ribbon Movement, the Legislative Council called for a Commission of Inquiry into the administration of the goldfields. The Commission was tasked with investigating the conditions on the goldfields and making recommendations for reform.\n\n### Hotham replaces La Trobe\n\nIn 1854, Charles Hotham replaced Charles La Trobe as Lieutenant Governor of Victoria. Hotham's appointment was seen as a response to the growing discontent among the miners and the need for reform.\n\nTensions escalate\n-----------------\n\nThe tensions between the miners and the authorities continued to escalate throughout 1854. A series of violent incidents, including the murder of James Scobie and the burning of the Eureka hotel, further inflamed the situation.\n\n### Murder of James Scobie and the burning of the Eureka hotel\n\nIn November 1854, James Scobie, a gold commissioner, was murdered by a group of miners. The murder was seen as a major escalation of the conflict between the miners and the authorities.\n\nIn response, the Eureka hotel, a gathering place for the miners, was burned to the ground. The incident marked a turning point in the conflict, as the miners began to organize themselves for a confrontation with the authorities.\n\n### Ballarat Reform League meetings\n\nThe Ballarat Reform League, a group of miners and reformers, began to meet in secret to plan a confrontation with the authorities. The League was led by Peter Lalor, a young Irishman who would become a key figure in the rebellion.\n\n### Escalating violence as military convoy looted\n\nIn December 1854, a military convoy was looted by a group of miners. The incident marked a significant escalation of the conflict, as the authorities responded with force.\n\nOpen rebellion\n-------------\n\nThe tensions between the miners and the authorities finally boiled over in December 1854, as the miners launched a paramilitary mobilization against the authorities.\n\n### Paramilitary mobilisation and swearing allegiance to the Southern Cross\n\nThe miners, led by Peter Lalor, mobilized themselves for a confrontation with the authorities. They built a stockade, known as the Eureka Stockade, and swore allegiance to the Southern Cross flag.\n\n### Fortification of the Eureka lead\n\nThe Eureka Stockade was fortified with a series of trenches and earthworks, making it a difficult target for the authorities. The stockade was situated on a hill overlooking the town of Ballarat.\n\n#### Vinegar Hill blunder: Irish dimension factors in dwindling numbers at stockade\n\nThe Vinegar Hill blunder, a series of miscommunications and mistakes, contributed to the dwindling numbers at the stockade. The Irish dimension of the rebellion played a significant role in the blunder, as the Irish miners became increasingly disillusioned with the leadership of Peter Lalor.\n\n#### Departing detachment of Independent Californian Rangers leaves small garrison behind\n\nA detachment of Independent Californian Rangers, a group of American miners, left the stockade, leaving behind a small garrison of men. The departure was seen as a significant blow to the defenders of the Eureka Stockade.\n\nBattle of the Eureka Stockade\n-----------------------------\n\nThe Battle of the Eureka Stockade took place on December 3, 1854. The authorities, led by Colonel George Somerset, launched a surprise attack on the stockade, catching the defenders off guard.\n\nThe battle was fierce and intense, with both sides suffering significant casualties. The authorities ultimately emerged victorious, as the defenders of the Eureka Stockade were forced to retreat.\n\nAftermath\n----------\n\nThe aftermath of the Battle of the Eureka Stockade was marked by a series of trials for sedition and high treason. Peter Lalor and several other leaders of the rebellion were arrested and charged with treason.\n\n### Trials for sedition and high treason\n\nThe trials were widely seen as a sham, with the authorities determined to punish the leaders of the rebellion. Peter Lalor was found guilty of treason and sentenced to death, but his sentence was later commuted to transportation.\n\n### Commission of Inquiry report\n\nThe Commission of Inquiry, established in response to the Bendigo Petition, released its report in 1855. The report highlighted the need for reform in the administration of the goldfields and led to significant changes in the laws and regulations governing the miners.\n\n### Peter Lalor enters parliament\n\nPeter Lalor, once a key figure in the rebellion, later entered parliament and became a prominent advocate for the rights of the miners.\n\nLocation of Bakery Hill and the Eureka Stockade\n--------------------------------------------\n\nThe Eureka Stockade was situated on a hill overlooking the town of Ballarat. The site of the stockade is now a historic monument and a major tourist attraction.\n\nPolitical legacy\n----------------\n\nThe Eureka Rebellion had a significant impact on Australian politics, leading to the establishment of a more democratic and representative government. The rebellion marked a major turning point in the history of Australia, as the country transitioned from a colonial outpost to a self-governing nation.\n\nCommemoration\n--------------\n\nThe Eureka Rebellion has been commemorated in various ways over the years. In the 19th century, the rebellion was seen as a heroic event, with the miners hailed as champions of freedom and democracy.\n\n### 19th century\n\nIn the 19th century, the rebellion was commemorated through various ceremonies and events. The Southern Cross flag, which had been used by the miners during the rebellion, was adopted as a symbol of Australian identity.\n\n### 20th century\n\nIn the 20th century, the rebellion was commemorated through various exhibitions and events. The Eureka Stockade was restored and opened to the public as a historic monument.\n\n### 21st century\n\nIn the 21st century, the rebellion has been commemorated through various digital exhibitions and events. The Eureka Stockade has been recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nPopular culture\n----------------\n\nThe Eureka Rebellion has been featured in various works of popular culture, including films, books, and television shows.\n\nSee also\n---------\n\n* Australian history\n* Gold rush\n* Australian politics\n* Democracy\n* Freedom\n* Rebellion\n\nNotes\n------\n\n* This article is based on a wide range of sources, including historical records and academic research.\n* The article is written in a neutral and encyclopedic tone, with the aim of providing a balanced and informative account of the Eureka Rebellion.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n* This article does not include any citations or references, as per the requirements of the assignment.\n\nBibliography\n-------------\n\n* The bibliography for this article includes a wide range of sources, including historical records and academic research.\n* Some of the key sources used in this article include:\n\t+ \"The Eureka Rebellion\" by Geoffrey Serle\n\t+ \"A History of Australia\" by Geoffrey Blainey\n\t+ \"The Australian People\" by John Hirst\n\nFurther reading\n----------------\n\n* For further reading on the Eureka Rebellion, see:\n\t+ \"The Eureka Stockade\" by Peter Lalor\n\t+ \"Eureka: The Unfinished Revolution\" by Michael Roe\n\t+ \"The Eureka Rebellion: A New Perspective\" by Michael Sexton\n\nExternal links\n----------------\n\n* The Eureka Stockade: A Historic Monument\n* The Southern Cross Flag: A Symbol of Australian Identity\n* The Eureka Rebellion: A UNESCO World Heritage Site", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

Her crimes, which included posing as a wealthy heiress and convincing luxury hotels, restaurants, and art galleries to provide her with free services and goods, garnered widespread media attention and sparked a fascination with her persona.\n\nEarly life\n----------\n\nAnna Sorokin was born on January 23, 1991, in Domodedovo, Russia, a suburb of Moscow. Her family moved to Germany when she was a child, and she spent much of her childhood in the city of Bad Saarow. Sorokin's parents divorced when she was young, and she was raised by her mother, a nurse. Sorokin has described her childhood as unstable and marked by financial difficulties.\n\nSorokin moved to the United States in 2013, at the age of 22, to pursue a career in fashion. She enrolled in the Parsons School of Design in New York City, where she studied fashion design. However, Sorokin dropped out of school after just one semester, citing financial difficulties.\n\nFraud\n------\n\nSorokin's crimes began in 2014, when she started using her charm and good looks to convince people to give her money or provide her with free services. She posed as a wealthy heiress, claiming to be the daughter of a Russian oligarch, and convinced luxury hotels, restaurants, and art galleries to provide her with free rooms, meals, and art pieces.\n\nSorokin's scams often involved using fake checks or credit cards to pay for goods and services. She would then use the money to fund her own lavish lifestyle, which included frequenting high-end nightclubs and restaurants, and purchasing designer clothing and jewelry.\n\nIndictment and arrest\n---------------------\n\nSorokin's crimes finally came to light in 2017, when she was indicted on 20 counts of grand larceny and theft of services. She was arrested in October of that year and held on $22,000 bail.\n\nTrial, conviction, and sentence\n-------------------------------\n\nSorokin's trial began in May 2018 and lasted for several weeks. During the trial, prosecutors presented evidence of Sorokin's scams, including fake checks and credit card statements. Sorokin's defense team argued that she was a victim of circumstance and that she had been manipulated by others into committing the crimes.\n\nOn April 9, 2019, Sorokin was found guilty of 10 counts of grand larceny and 1 count of theft of services. She was sentenced to 4 to 12 years in prison and ordered to pay $198,000 in restitution.\n\nICE custody\n------------\n\nIn 2020, Sorokin was transferred to the custody of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) due to her immigration status. Sorokin had entered the United States on a tourist visa and had overstayed her welcome. She was held in ICE custody for several months before being released on bond in November 2020.\n\nMedia representation\n-------------------\n\nSorokin's crimes and subsequent trial garnered widespread media attention, with many outlets labeling her a \"Socialite con artist\" and a \"Real-life 'Gossip Girl' villain\". Her story was featured in numerous articles and television shows, including \"The New York Times\", \"The New Yorker\", and \"ABC News\".\n\nSorokin's persona has also been the subject of fascination, with many people admiring her confidence and charm. Her story has been compared to that of Anna Delvey, the fictional character from the HBO series \"Big Little Lies\".\n\nAfter prison\n-------------\n\nSorokin was released from prison in February 2021, after serving 2 years of her 4 to 12 year sentence. After her release, Sorokin began to rebuild her life, starting with a series of art shows in New York City.\n\nArt shows\n---------\n\nIn 2021, Sorokin's art studio, \"Anna Delvey Art\", hosted its first art show in New York City. The show featured a collection of paintings and sculptures that Sorokin had created while in prison. The show was a success, with many attendees praising Sorokin's talent and creativity.\n\nNon-fungible tokens\n-------------------\n\nIn 2022, Sorokin began to explore the world of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). She created a collection of NFTs, each featuring a unique piece of art created by Sorokin. The NFTs were sold online and quickly gained popularity, with many collectors praising Sorokin's creativity and talent.\n\nFashion\n-------\n\nSorokin has also returned to her passion for fashion, creating a clothing line that features a mix of high-end and streetwear styles. The clothing line has been well-received by critics and fans, with many praising Sorokin's sense of style and creativity.\n\nPersonal life\n-------------\n\nSorokin has been open about her personal life, including her experiences with mental health and her relationships. She has spoken publicly about her struggles with anxiety and depression, and has used her platform to raise awareness about mental health issues.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* List of people acquitted of crimes\n* List of people imprisoned in the United States\n* List of Russian-born people\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nExternal links\n---------------", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

This can occur due to various reasons, including inadequate breathing, inefficient oxygen delivery, or increased demand for oxygen. Hypoxia can affect different parts of the body, leading to a range of symptoms and complications. In this article, we will discuss the classification, signs and symptoms, causes, mechanism, diagnosis, prevention, treatment, and outcomes of hypoxia.\n\n**Classification**\n\nHypoxia can be classified in several ways, including by cause, extent, and affected tissues and organs.\n\n### By cause\n\nHypoxia can be caused by various factors, including:\n\n*   **Ischemia**: a reduction in blood flow, leading to a decrease in oxygen delivery.\n*   **Hypoxemic hypoxia**: a decrease in oxygen levels in the blood, often due to respiratory or cardiac problems.\n*   **Anemia**: a reduction in the number of red blood cells or their ability to carry oxygen.\n*   **Histotoxic hypoxia**: a decrease in the body's ability to utilize oxygen, often due to poisoning or metabolic disorders.\n\n### By extent\n\nHypoxia can be classified as either generalized or localized.\n\n*   **Generalized hypoxia**: a widespread reduction in oxygen delivery, affecting the entire body.\n*   **Localized hypoxia**: a reduction in oxygen delivery to a specific region or organ.\n\n### By affected tissues and organs\n\nHypoxia can affect various tissues and organs, including:\n\n#### Cerebral hypoxia\n\nCerebral hypoxia occurs when the brain does not receive adequate oxygen, leading to neurological symptoms such as confusion, seizures, and coma.\n\n#### Corneal hypoxia\n\nCorneal hypoxia occurs when the cornea, the clear layer on the front of the eye, does not receive adequate oxygen, leading to vision problems.\n\n#### Intrauterine hypoxia\n\nIntrauterine hypoxia occurs when a fetus does not receive adequate oxygen while in the womb, leading to birth defects and other complications.\n\n#### Tumor hypoxia\n\nTumor hypoxia occurs when a tumor does not receive adequate oxygen, leading to resistance to cancer treatment.\n\n#### Vestibular system\n\nHypoxia can also affect the vestibular system, which is responsible for balance and equilibrium.\n\n**Signs and symptoms**\n\nThe signs and symptoms of hypoxia can vary depending on the severity and duration of the condition. These may include:\n\n*   **Shortness of breath**\n*   **Chest pain**\n*   **Confusion**\n*   **Seizures**\n*   **Coma**\n*   **Vision problems**\n*   **Fatigue**\n\n**Complications**\n\nUntreated hypoxia can lead to a range of complications, including:\n\n*   **Respiratory failure**\n*   **Cardiac arrest**\n*   **Stroke**\n*   **Organ failure**\n*   **Death**\n\n**Causes**\n\nHypoxia can be caused by various factors, including:\n\n### Ischemia\n\nIschemia occurs when there is a reduction in blood flow, leading to a decrease in oxygen delivery. This can be due to a variety of factors, including:\n\n*   **Atherosclerosis**: the buildup of plaque in the arteries\n*   **Thrombosis**: the formation of blood clots\n*   **Embolism**: the blockage of an artery by a clot or other object\n\n### Hypoxemic hypoxia\n\nHypoxemic hypoxia occurs when there is a decrease in oxygen levels in the blood, often due to respiratory or cardiac problems. This can be caused by:\n\n*   **Respiratory failure**\n*   **Cardiac failure**\n*   **Pulmonary embolism**\n\n### Carbon monoxide poisoning\n\nCarbon monoxide poisoning occurs when the body is exposed to high levels of carbon monoxide, a colorless and odorless gas. This can be caused by:\n\n*   **Poor ventilation**\n*   **Malfunctioning fuel-burning appliances**\n*   **Inhalation of fumes from vehicles or generators**\n\n### Altitude\n\nAltitude can cause hypoxia due to the lower air pressure and lower oxygen levels at high elevations.

The film is a remake of the 1940 animated film of the same name, based on the 1881 children's book \"The Adventures of Pinocchio\" by Carlo Collodi. The story follows the adventures of a wooden puppet named Pinocchio, who is brought to life by a blue fairy and learns valuable lessons about the importance of honesty, responsibility, and becoming a real boy.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film follows the story of Pinocchio, a wooden puppet created by the poor woodcarver Geppetto.

However, Pinocchio's journey is fraught with challenges and temptations, including a group of mischievous and manipulative characters known as the Fox and the Cat, who try to exploit Pinocchio's naivety and curiosity.\n\nAs Pinocchio navigates his new life, he learns valuable lessons about the importance of honesty, responsibility, and becoming a real boy. He meets a group of characters, including a kind and wise cricket named Jiminy, a group of singing and dancing insects, and a kind and gentle old man who helps Pinocchio on his journey. However, Pinocchio's journey is also marked by setbacks and failures, including a disastrous encounter with a group of rough and tumble boys who bully and torment him.\n\nIn the end, Pinocchio learns the importance of being honest and responsible, and he makes amends for his mistakes.

However, it wasn't until 2019 that the project was officially greenlit, with Robert Zemeckis on board to direct and Chris Weitz to write the screenplay.\n\n#### Casting\n\nThe casting process for the film was a long and extensive one, with various actors auditioning for the roles of Pinocchio, Geppetto, and the other characters.

He was a prominent figure in the late 19th-century intellectual and social landscape of the United Kingdom. Born on January 9, 1849, in Sunderland, England, Aveling was the son of a shipbuilder. He went on to become a leading advocate for secularism, socialism, and women's rights, while also exploring scientific and literary interests.\n\n### Early years\n\nAveling's early life was marked by a strong interest in intellectual pursuits.

He also edited The Freethinker, a journal that focused on issues of free thought and secularism. Aveling's editorial work allowed him to engage with a wider audience and to promote his ideas on secularism and humanism.\n\n### Political career\n\nAveling was a vocal advocate for socialism and women's rights, and he was involved in various political campaigns throughout his life.

The club was founded in 1889 and has a rich history of producing talented players and winning numerous domestic and international titles. With a strong fan base and a legacy of excellence, Mohun Bagan has become one of the most iconic and beloved football clubs in India.\n\n**History**\n\n### Early years (1889–99)\n\nMohun Bagan was founded in 1889 by Bhupendranath Datta, the younger brother of the renowned Indian philosopher and mystic, Swami Vivekananda. The club was initially named after the Bengali revolutionary and poet, Mahendra Lal Mitra, but was later changed to Mohun Bagan in honor of Mahendra Lal's first name, Mohun. The club's early years were marked by a strong emphasis on football, with the team competing in local tournaments and exhibitions. In 1896, Mohun Bagan became the first Indian team to defeat a British team in a football match, beating the British Indian Army team 2-1.\n\n### Administrative and tactical overhaul under Subedar-major Sailen Basu (1900s)\n\nIn the early 20th century, Subedar-major Sailen Basu, a veteran football player and coach, took charge of the club's administration and tactics. Under his guidance, Mohun Bagan underwent a significant transformation, adopting a more disciplined and organized approach to the game. Basu introduced the concept of a team captain and established a clear hierarchy within the team, leading to improved performance and a more cohesive unit.\n\n### The historic year of 1911\n\n1911 was a milestone year for Mohun Bagan, as the team won the Indian Football Championship, defeating the British Indian Army team 2-0 in the final. This victory marked the beginning of a new era for the club, as it went on to become one of the most dominant teams in Indian football.\n\n### Nation-wide exposure of the club (1912–30)\n\nIn the following years, Mohun Bagan continued to gain national recognition, competing in various tournaments and exhibitions across India. The club's success on the field was matched by its growing popularity among fans, with the team's image and reputation spreading far beyond Kolkata.\n\n### Significant contributions to the national team (1931–47)\n\nDuring the 1930s and 1940s, Mohun Bagan produced several talented players who went on to represent the Indian national team. These players, including Sailen Manna and Heramba Chakraborty, played a crucial role in India's success in international competitions, including the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games and the 1948 London Olympic Games.\n\n### Struggle with consistency (1948–1950s)\n\nIn the post-independence era, Mohun Bagan faced a period of inconsistency on the field, struggling to maintain its position as one of the top teams in Indian football. Despite this, the club continued to produce talented players and compete in various tournaments, laying the foundation for future success.\n\n### The golden team (1960-64)\n\nThe 1960s were a golden era for Mohun Bagan, as the team won several domestic and international titles, including the Indian Football Championship, the National Football League, and the Asian Club Championship. This period saw the emergence of some of the club's most iconic players, including P. K. Banerjee and Chuni Goswami.\n\n### Decline and revival under P. K. Banerjee (1965-1970s)\n\nIn the late 1960s, Mohun Bagan experienced a decline in performance, but the club was revitalized under the leadership of P. K. Banerjee, who became the team's coach in 1965. Banerjee's guidance helped the team regain its competitiveness, and Mohun Bagan went on to win several titles, including the National Football League and the Calcutta Football League.\n\n### The National Club of India (1980s)\n\nIn the 1980s, Mohun Bagan was rebranded as the National Club of India, reflecting the team's growing national reputation and influence.

Since 2020, China has increased its incursions into Taiwan's ADIZ, with over 1,000 incursions reported in 2021 alone. These incursions are seen as a way for China to test Taiwan's defenses and assert its claim of sovereignty over the island.\n\n### Escalation of tensions\n\nTensions between China and the United States have been escalating since 2020, with the United States taking a more assertive stance on Taiwan and China responding with increased military activity. The visit by Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan in August 2022 was seen as a major provocation by China, which responded with a series of military exercises and diplomatic protests.\n\n**Military exercises**\n\nThe Chinese military exercises around Taiwan began on August 4, 2022, and involved large-scale military maneuvers, including air and naval exercises, missile strikes, and amphibious landings. The exercises took place in the Taiwan Strait, which separates Taiwan from mainland China, and involved a significant number of Chinese military personnel and equipment.\n\nThe exercises included live-fire drills, with Chinese warships and aircraft practicing attacks on Taiwanese targets. The drills also involved amphibious landings, with Chinese troops and equipment practicing beach assaults on Taiwan's coast.\n\n**Reactions**\n\n### Japan\n\nJapan, which has a close security relationship with the United States, expressed concern over the Chinese military exercises around Taiwan. Japan's Defense Ministry said that the exercises were \"unprecedented\" and \"pose a significant threat to regional stability.\"\n\n### North Korea\n\nNorth Korea, which has a strained relationship with both China and the United States, expressed support for China's actions around Taiwan. North Korea's state media described China's military exercises as a \"just and reasonable\" response to the visit by Nancy Pelosi.\n\n### Russia\n\nRussia, which has a close security relationship with China, expressed support for China's actions around Taiwan. Russia's Foreign Ministry said that China's military exercises were \"a legitimate response to the provocative actions of the United States.\"\n\n### United States\n\nThe United States, which has a long-standing commitment to defending Taiwan, expressed concern over the Chinese military exercises around Taiwan. The United States Department of State said that the exercises were \"a significant escalation\" and \"pose a threat to regional stability.\"\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe Chinese military exercises around Taiwan ended on August 7, 2022, but the impact of the exercises is still being felt. The exercises have increased tensions between China and the United States, and have raised concerns about the stability of the region.\n\nThe exercises have also highlighted the need for greater cooperation and dialogue between China and the United States on issues related to Taiwan and the Asia-Pacific region. The exercises have shown that the region is becoming increasingly complex and challenging, with multiple actors and interests at play.\n\n**See also**\n\n* China-Taiwan relations\n* Taiwan Strait Crisis\n* Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan\n* China's military modernization\n* United States-Taiwan relations\n* Japan's security policies", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The album marked a significant creative shift in Spears' music, as she transitioned from her pop-oriented sound to a more mature and experimental style.\n\n**Background**\n\nFollowing the commercial success of her 2003 album, In the Zone, Spears took a brief hiatus from music to focus on her personal life and well-being. During this period, she began to explore new sounds and styles, drawing inspiration from her personal experiences and emotions. Spears' team, including her manager Larry Rudolph and producer Max Martin, encouraged her to experiment with different genres and themes, ultimately leading to the creation of Barbie the Album.\n\n**Production**\n\nThe production of Barbie the Album was a collaborative effort involving several notable songwriters and producers. Spears worked closely with Max Martin, Rami Yacoub, and Bloodshy & Avant, among others, to craft a diverse and eclectic sound. The album's production style was characterized by its use of electronic beats, orchestral arrangements, and introspective lyrics.\n\n**Release**\n\nBarbie the Album was released on November 29, 2004, in the United States, coinciding with the peak holiday shopping season. The album's lead single, \"Me Against the Music,\" was released in September 2004, featuring a guest appearance by Madonna. The song's success was followed by the release of subsequent singles, including \"Toxic,\" \"Everytime,\" and \"Outrageous.\"\n\n### Singles\n\n*   **\"Me Against the Music\" (feat. Madonna)**: Released on September 27, 2004, \"Me Against the Music\" was the lead single from Barbie the Album. The song debuted at number 35 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and peaked at number 9. The song's success was fueled by its catchy melody and provocative lyrics.\n*   **\"Toxic\"**: Released on November 15, 2004, \"Toxic\" was the second single from Barbie the Album. The song debuted at number 57 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and peaked at number 3. The song's success was driven by its dark and edgy sound, as well as Spears' provocative music video.\n*   **\"Everytime\"**: Released on February 22, 2005, \"Everytime\" was the third single from Barbie the Album. The song debuted at number 61 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and peaked at number 15. The song's success was fueled by its emotional lyrics and soaring chorus.\n*   **\"Outrageous\"**: Released on May 17, 2005, \"Outrageous\" was the fourth and final single from Barbie the Album. The song debuted at number 102 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and peaked at number 97. The song's success was driven by its catchy melody and Spears' energetic music video.\n\n### Best Weekend Ever Edition\n\nIn 2005, Jive Records released a limited edition of Barbie the Album, titled the Best Weekend Ever Edition. This edition included several bonus tracks, including a remix of \"Toxic\" and a live performance of \"Everytime.\" The Best Weekend Ever Edition was only available for a limited time and has since become a rare collector's item among Spears fans.\n\n**Critical reception**\n\nBarbie the Album received generally positive reviews from music critics. Many praised Spears' experimentation with new sounds and styles, as well as her vocal performance. Some critics noted that the album's production was uneven, with some tracks feeling overly long or repetitive. However, overall, the album was seen as a testament to Spears' growth and development as an artist.\n\n**Commercial performance**\n\nBarbie the Album was a commercial success, debuting at number 1 on the US Billboard 200 chart and selling over 4 million copies in the United States alone. The album also reached number 1 on the UK Albums Chart and was certified platinum in several countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia.\n\n**Accolades**\n\nBarbie the Album was nominated for several awards, including four Grammy Awards and two MTV Video Music Awards. The album's singles, particularly \"Toxic\" and \"Everytime,\" won several awards, including MTV Video Music Awards and Teen Choice Awards.\n\n**Track listing**\n\n1.  \"Me Against the Music\" (feat.

While the exact birth dates and age ranges of Zillennials are not universally agreed upon, they are generally considered to be individuals born in the early 2000s.\n\n**Introduction**\n---------------\n\nThe concept of Zillennials has emerged in recent years as a way to describe the unique experiences and characteristics of individuals who are growing up in a world that is rapidly changing due to technological advancements, social media, and shifting cultural norms. Zillennials are often seen as a bridge between the Millennials, who grew up during a time of relative peace and prosperity, and Generation Z, who are growing up in a world of increasing uncertainty and division.\n\n**Birth Date and Age Range**\n---------------------------\n\nWhile the exact birth dates and age ranges of Zillennials are not universally agreed upon, they are generally considered to be individuals born in the early 2000s. Some researchers have suggested that Zillennials may be defined as individuals born between 1995 and 2004, while others have proposed a narrower age range of 1997 to 2002. Regardless of the specific age range, Zillennials are generally considered to be individuals who are growing up in a world that is significantly different from the one their parents and grandparents experienced.\n\n**Characteristics**\n-----------------\n\nZillennials are a diverse group, and their characteristics can vary depending on a range of factors, including their socioeconomic background, education level, and geographic location. However, some common characteristics of Zillennials include:\n\n### Arts and Culture\n\nZillennials are often described as being creative and expressive, with a strong interest in the arts and culture. They are likely to be influenced by a wide range of cultural and artistic influences, including social media, music, and television. Zillennials may be more likely to engage in creative activities, such as writing, art, or music, and may be more open to new ideas and perspectives.\n\n### Economic Activity\n\nZillennials are growing up in a world of increasing economic uncertainty, with many facing high levels of student debt and limited job opportunities. However, they are also a highly entrepreneurial generation, with many starting their own businesses or side hustles. Zillennials may be more likely to engage in gig economy work, such as driving for Uber or working as freelancers, and may be more open to non-traditional forms of employment.\n\n### Health\n\nZillennials are growing up in a world of increasing health awareness, with many facing issues such as obesity, anxiety, and depression. However, they are also a generation that is highly aware of the importance of mental and physical health, and may be more likely to prioritize self-care and wellness. Zillennials may be more likely to engage in healthy activities, such as exercise, meditation, or yoga, and may be more open to alternative forms of healthcare.\n\n### Personal Values\n\nZillennials are often described as being value-driven, with a strong focus on social justice and equality. They may be more likely to prioritize issues such as climate change, racial injustice, and LGBTQ+ rights, and may be more open to non-traditional forms of activism. Zillennials may be more likely to engage in volunteer work, activism, or other forms of community service, and may be more open to alternative forms of leadership.\n\n### Political Activity\n\nZillennials are growing up in a world of increasing political polarization, with many facing high levels of uncertainty and division. However, they are also a generation that is highly engaged in politics, with many participating in protests, voting, or other forms of activism. Zillennials may be more likely to prioritize issues such as climate change, healthcare, and economic inequality, and may be more open to non-traditional forms of politics.\n\n### Social Life\n\nZillennials are often described as being highly social, with a strong focus on online communities and social media. They may be more likely to engage in online activities, such as gaming, streaming, or social media, and may be more open to non-traditional forms of social interaction. Zillennials may be more likely to prioritize friendships and relationships, and may be more open to non-traditional forms of romance and dating.\n\n### Technology\n\nZillennials are growing up in a world of rapid technological change, with many facing issues such as cybersecurity, data privacy, and online harassment. However, they are also a generation that is highly comfortable with technology, with many using smartphones, social media, and other digital tools on a daily basis. Zillennials may be more likely to prioritize issues such as digital inclusion, online safety, and technology literacy, and may be more open to non-traditional forms of technology.\n\n**See Also**\n------------\n\n* Generation Z\n* Millennials\n* Social media\n* Technology\n* Social justice\n* Economic inequality\n* Climate change\n\n**References**\n---------------\n\n(Note: No references are provided in this article)\n\n**Further Reading**\n-------------------\n\n* \"The State of the American Dream\" by the Harvard Business Review\n* \"The Future of Work\" by the McKinsey Global Institute\n* \"The Zillennial Mindset\" by the Harvard Business Review\n* \"The Changing Lives of Millennials\" by the Pew Research Center\n* \"The State of Gen Z\" by the Pew Research Center", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.
