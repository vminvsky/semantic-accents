Ron Hubbard in 1954. It is characterized by a complex and multifaceted system of beliefs and practices that have been the subject of controversy and debate. This article provides an overview of the movement, its history, and its various aspects.\n\n**Definition and classification**\n\nScientology is often classified as a new religious movement (NRM), a term used to describe groups that emerged in the 20th century and share characteristics with earlier spiritual and philosophical traditions. However, Scientology's unique blend of science fiction, self-help, and spiritual elements has led some to question its classification as a traditional religion.\n\nSome critics have labeled Scientology a cult, citing its authoritarian structure, emphasis on secrecy, and allegations of coercive practices. Others have characterized it as a business or a form of spiritual entertainment. Hubbard himself described Scientology as a \"religion\" and a \"science,\" and the movement has been recognized as a tax-exempt organization in the United States.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe term \"Scientology\" was coined by Hubbard, who derived it from the words \"science\" and \"ology\" (study). Hubbard claimed that the term referred to the study of the mind and its relationship to the physical universe.\n\n**History**\n\nL. Ron Hubbard, a science fiction author and self-proclaimed philosopher, developed the core ideas of Scientology in the 1940s and 1950s. He drew on his interests in psychology, philosophy, and science fiction to create a system of spiritual and therapeutic practices that he called \"Dianetics.\"\n\nDianetics, which Hubbard introduced in his 1950 book of the same name, proposed that the human mind is a repository of past traumas and experiences that can be recovered and eliminated through a process called \"auditing.\" Hubbard later expanded Dianetics into the more comprehensive system of beliefs and practices that he called Scientology.\n\n**Beliefs and practices**\n\nScientology is based on a complex set of concepts and practices that are outlined in Hubbard's writings and lectures. Some of the key aspects of Scientology include:\n\n### **Auditing**\n\nAuditing is a central practice in Scientology, in which a trained auditor uses specialized equipment and techniques to help individuals recover and eliminate past traumas and experiences. The goal of auditing is to achieve spiritual freedom and self-awareness.\n\n### **Soul**\n\nScientologists believe in the existence of a spiritual entity called the \"thetan,\" which is said to be immortal and capable of reincarnation. The thetan is seen as the true self, distinct from the physical body and the ego.\n\n### **Space opera and the Wall of Fire**\n\nScientology's mythology includes a narrative of galactic history and the existence of advanced civilizations. The movement's founder, L. Ron Hubbard, claimed to have been a spacefaring sailor and adventurer in his past life, and he developed a fictional account of the universe and its history.\n\n### **The Operating Thetan levels**\n\nThe Operating Thetan (OT) levels are a series of advanced spiritual practices and teachings that are available to high-ranking Scientologists. These levels are said to provide individuals with greater spiritual awareness and power.\n\n### **Ethics**\n\nScientology's ethics code is based on a set of principles and guidelines that are designed to promote spiritual growth and self-awareness. The code emphasizes the importance of responsibility, honesty, and self-reflection.\n\n### **Symbology**\n\nScientology uses a range of symbols and icons, including the cross, the ankh, and the \"eight-ball\" (a symbol representing the eight dynamics of life). These symbols are used in various contexts, including auditing, rituals, and artwork.\n\n### **Psychiatry, psychology, psychosis**\n\nScientology has a complex and often critical relationship with psychiatry and psychology. Hubbard developed his own approach to psychology and mental health, which he called \"Dianetics.\" Scientologists often view psychiatry and psychology as ineffective or even harmful.\n\n### **Views on Hubbard**\n\nScientologists view L. Ron Hubbard as a messianic figure and the founder of their faith. They often revere him as a spiritual leader and a visionary who brought them the truth about the universe and human nature.\n\n**The Church of Scientology**\n\nThe Church of Scientology is the formal organization that promotes and administers the movement's teachings and practices. It was founded by L. Ron Hubbard in 1954 and is headquartered in Los Angeles, California.\n\n### **Internal organization**\n\nThe Church of Scientology is organized into a hierarchical structure, with local churches and missions serving as the primary unit of organization. Each church or mission is headed by a senior minister or executive who reports to the International Base in Los Angeles.\n\n### **Promotional material**\n\nThe Church of Scientology produces a range of promotional materials, including books, videos, and advertisements, to promote its teachings and practices. These materials often feature testimonials from satisfied members and emphasize the movement's benefits and success stories.\n\n### **Social outreach**\n\nScientology has a range of social outreach programs and charities, including the \"Ideal World\" project, which aims to improve living conditions and promote human rights around the world.\n\n### **Responses to opponents**\n\nThe Church of Scientology has a well-developed system for responding to critics and opponents, which includes lawsuits, smear campaigns, and other forms of pressure. This approach has been criticized as coercive and intimidating.\n\n### **Suppressive persons and fair game**\n\nScientology has a system of \"Suppressive Persons\" (SPs), individuals who are seen as enemies of the movement. SPs are viewed as threats to the well-being of Scientologists and are often subjected to harassment and intimidation.\n\n**Free Zone and independent Scientology**\n\nThere are also independent Scientology communities and organizations that are not affiliated with the Church of Scientology. These groups often follow a modified version of Hubbard's teachings and practices, and may reject some or all of the Church's hierarchical structure and doctrine.\n\n**Controversies**\n\nScientology has been the subject of numerous controversies and criticisms over the years. Some of the most significant issues include:\n\n### **Hubbard's motives**\n\nL. Ron Hubbard's motivations for creating Scientology have been the subject of debate and controversy. Some have questioned his sincerity and integrity, while others have seen him as a visionary and a spiritual leader.\n\n### **Criminal behavior**\n\nThe Church of Scientology has been accused of engaging in various forms of criminal behavior, including embezzlement, tax evasion, and organized harassment.\n\n### **Organized harassment**\n\nScientologists have been accused of engaging in organized harassment and intimidation of critics and opponents, including ex-members and journalists.\n\n### **Mistreatment of Members**\n\nThere have been allegations of physical, emotional, and psychological abuse of Scientologists by Church officials and other members. Some have reported being subjected to forced labor, physical confinement, and other forms of mistreatment.\n\n### **Violation of auditing confidentiality**\n\nScientologists are required to sign confidentiality agreements before undergoing auditing, which has led to allegations of breach of confidentiality and exploitation of sensitive information.\n\n### **Allegations of coerced abortions**\n\nThere have been allegations that the Church of Scientology has coerced or pressured members into undergoing abortions, often under the guise of protecting their spiritual or mental well-being.\n\n### **Allegation of human trafficking and other crimes against women**\n\nThere have been allegations of human trafficking, physical abuse, and other crimes against women who are members of the Church of Scientology.\n\n### **Scientology, litigation, and the Internet**\n\nScientology has been the subject of numerous lawsuits and Internet campaigns over the years, including allegations of copyright infringement, defamation, and harassment.\n\n**Disputes over legal status**\n\nScientology has been the subject of disputes over its legal status in various countries, including the United States, where it has been recognized as a tax-exempt organization. Some have questioned its tax-exempt status, citing its commercial activities and alleged abuses.\n\n**Scientology in religious studies**\n\nScientology has been the subject of academic study and analysis in the field of religious studies. Some scholars have sought to understand the movement's origins, teachings, and practices, while others have criticized its approach to spirituality and its treatment of critics.\n\n### **Influences**\n\nScientology has been influenced by a range of spiritual and philosophical traditions, including Eastern religions, Western esotericism, and science fiction. Hubbard's own interests and experiences have also shaped the movement's development.\n\n**Demographics**\n\nScientology has a global presence, with churches and missions in over 160 countries. The movement is estimated to have between 25,000 and 50,000 members worldwide.\n\n### **Recruitment**\n\nScientology recruits new members through a range of channels, including advertising, word of mouth, and recruitment drives. The movement's promotional materials often emphasize its benefits and success stories.\n\n**Reception and influence**\n\nScientology has been the subject of significant media coverage and public scrutiny over the years. Some have praised its approach to spirituality and its emphasis on self-awareness, while others have criticized its authoritarian structure, alleged abuses, and commercial activities.\n\n### **Media, popular culture, and academia**\n\nScientology has been the subject of various forms of media, including films, books, and television shows. The movement has also been featured in popular culture, including music and art. In academic circles, Scientology has been the subject of study and analysis in the fields of sociology, psychology, and religious studies.\n\n**See also**\n\n* List of Scientology and Dianetics books\n* List of Scientology celebrities\n* List of Scientology organizations\n\n**References**\n\n* Sources:\n\t+ Church of Scientology\n\t+ L.

The train was unveiled on February 15, 2019, and was initially operational between New Delhi and Varanasi with a journey time of just 8 hours and 30 minutes. The Vande Bharat Express is designed to provide a comfortable and efficient travel experience, with modern amenities and advanced technology.\n\n**History**\n\n### Efforts to increase speed (1960–2016)\n\nThe Indian Railways has a long history of developing high-speed trains, with the first effort dating back to the 1960s. The Railways had introduced the first high-speed train, the LHB (Linke Hofmann Busch) coaches, in 1960. These coaches were designed to achieve speeds of up to 160 km/h (99 mph) and were initially introduced on the Delhi-Mumbai route. However, the speed of these trains was limited due to the lack of adequate infrastructure and technology.\n\nIn the 1980s, the Railways introduced the Shatabdi Express, a semi-high-speed train that could reach speeds of up to 150 km/h (93 mph). The Shatabdi Express was a significant improvement over the earlier LHB coaches and provided a more comfortable travel experience. However, the speed of the Shatabdi Express was still limited due to the outdated infrastructure and technology.\n\n### Making an indigenous trainset (2016–19)\n\nIn 2016, the Indian Railways decided to develop an indigenous high-speed trainset, which would be designed and manufactured in India. The project was undertaken by the Integral Coach Factory (ICF) in Chennai, in collaboration with the Rail Coach Factory (RCF) in Kapurthala. The new trainset was designed to achieve speeds of up to 300 km/h (186 mph) and would feature advanced technology and modern amenities.\n\nThe development of the indigenous trainset was a significant challenge, as it required the Railways to develop new technologies and design capabilities. The project involved the creation of a new design and manufacturing process, which would enable the production of high-speed trainsets in India.\n\n### Introduction and further (2019–present)\n\nThe Vande Bharat Express was unveiled on February 15, 2019, and was initially operational between New Delhi and Varanasi. The train was designed to provide a comfortable and efficient travel experience, with modern amenities and advanced technology. The Vande Bharat Express features 16 coaches, including 2 AC executive class coaches, 12 AC chair car coaches, and 2 power cars.\n\nThe Vande Bharat Express has been a game-changer for the Indian Railways, providing a faster and more comfortable travel experience. The train has been a huge success, with over 20,000 passengers traveling on the Delhi-Varanasi route in the first month of its operation.

The budget was widely criticized for its potential impact on the UK's economy and public finances, and it played a significant role in the eventual resignation of Prime Minister Liz Truss.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe UK was experiencing a period of high inflation, which was partly driven by the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine. The government had pledged to reduce taxes and increase government spending to stimulate economic growth and alleviate the cost of living crisis. However, this approach was met with skepticism by many economists and opposition politicians, who warned that it could lead to a fiscal crisis and undermine the UK's economic reputation.\n\n**The budget**\n\nThe mini-budget announced a series of significant tax cuts and changes to government spending. These included:\n\n### Key points\n\n* A reduction in the basic rate of income tax from 20% to 19%\n* A reduction in the top rate of income tax from 45% to 40%\n* A reduction in the rate of National Insurance contributions for employees and employers\n* A reduction in corporation tax from 19% to 15%\n* An abolition of the cap on bankers' bonuses\n* A £5 billion reduction in stamp duty land tax\n* A £1.4 billion reduction in fuel duty\n\nThe budget also included a number of measures to boost economic growth, such as increased investment in infrastructure and a relaxation of planning laws to allow for more building.\n\n**Reaction**\n\nThe mini-budget was widely criticized by economists, opposition politicians, and many within the Conservative Party. The reaction was particularly negative in the following areas:\n\n### Currency, interest rate, and debt\n\nThe pound sterling fell sharply in value following the announcement, reaching a record low against the US dollar. The UK government's debt was also criticized for being unsustainable, with the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) warning that the budget was likely to lead to a significant increase in borrowing.\n\n### Bond markets\n\nThe bond markets were also negatively affected by the budget, with the UK government's borrowing costs rising sharply. This was partly due to concerns about the sustainability of the UK's debt and the potential for inflation to rise further.\n\n### International response\n\nThe international response to the budget was largely negative, with many economists and policymakers warning that the UK's approach was unsustainable. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the European Central Bank (ECB) both expressed concerns about the UK's economic policies and the potential for a fiscal crisis.\n\n### Business and economic\n\nMany businesses and economic organizations also criticized the budget, warning that it could lead to a fiscal crisis and undermine the UK's economic reputation. The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and the Institute of Directors (IoD) both expressed concerns about the budget's potential impact on the UK's economy.\n\n### Media\n\nThe media reaction to the budget was largely negative, with many newspapers and commentators warning that the UK's approach was unsustainable. The BBC and the Financial Times both criticized the budget, warning that it could lead to a fiscal crisis and undermine the UK's economic reputation.\n\n### Political\n\nThe opposition parties, including the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats, also criticized the budget, warning that it could lead to a fiscal crisis and undermine the UK's economic reputation. The Scottish National Party (SNP) and the Welsh Labour Party also criticized the budget, warning that it could have a negative impact on their respective countries.\n\n### Opinion polling\n\nThe opinion polls were also largely negative, with many voters expressing concerns about the budget and the UK's economic policies. A survey by the YouGov polling organization found that 62% of voters believed that the budget was a bad idea, while 22% believed that it was a good idea.\n\n**Government response**\n\nThe government's response to the criticism of the budget was largely defensive, with Chancellor Kwarteng and Prime Minister Truss expressing their commitment to the UK's economic policies. However, the government was forced to make a number of concessions in the face of criticism, including:\n\n### Initial responses\n\nThe government initially refused to reverse the tax cuts, despite criticism from economists and opposition politicians. However, the government did announce a number of measures to boost economic growth, including increased investment in infrastructure and a relaxation of planning laws.\n\n### Dismissal of Chancellor\n\nOn 14 October 2022, Prime Minister Truss announced that she had sacked Chancellor Kwarteng, citing his failure to communicate the government's economic policies effectively. The decision was widely criticized by economists and opposition politicians, who warned that it would undermine the UK's economic reputation.\n\n### Reversal of tax cuts\n\nOn 17 October 2022, the government announced that it would reverse the tax cuts, citing concerns about the impact on the UK's economy and public finances. The decision was widely welcomed by economists and opposition politicians, who warned that the original tax cuts were unsustainable.\n\n**Resignation of Truss as Prime Minister**\n\nOn 25 October 2022, Prime Minister Truss announced her resignation, citing her failure to communicate the government's economic policies effectively and her inability to maintain the confidence of her party. The decision was widely welcomed by economists and opposition politicians, who warned that the UK's economic policies were unsustainable.\n\n**Subsequent events**\n\nFollowing Truss's resignation, the UK government was led by an interim Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, who announced a number of measures to boost economic growth and stabilize the UK's economy. The UK's economic policies were also the subject of a number of reviews and inquiries, including a review of the UK's fiscal framework and a inquiry into the UK's economic policies.\n\n### Following Truss's resignation\n\nThe aftermath of Truss's resignation was marked by a number of controversies, including a row over the UK's economic policies and a dispute between the UK's Conservative Party and the Labour Party over the UK's economic policies. The controversy was widely covered by the media, with many newspapers and commentators expressing concerns about the UK's economic policies.\n\n### Later events\n\nIn the months following Truss's resignation, the UK government continued to implement a number of measures to boost economic growth and stabilize the UK's economy. The UK's economic policies were also the subject of a number of reviews and inquiries, including a review of the UK's fiscal framework and a inquiry into the UK's economic policies.\n\n**See also**\n\n* List of Conservative Party politicians\n* List of Labour Party politicians\n* List of Liberal Democrats politicians\n* List of Scottish National Party politicians\n* List of Welsh Labour Party politicians\n* List of UK economic policies\n* List of UK fiscal policies", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The championship was won by Ding Liren of China, who defeated Ian Nepomniachtchi of Russia in a thrilling match. The championship was notable for being the first time that Magnus Carlsen, the reigning world chess champion, refused to defend his title.\n\n**History of non-participation**\n\nThis was not the first time that Magnus Carlsen had refused to defend his title. Carlsen had previously declined to play a match against challenger Fabiano Caruana in 2020, citing a desire to focus on his other chess activities. However, in 2021, Carlsen did agree to play a match against Ian Nepomniachtchi, which he won convincingly. This was followed by a period of relative inactivity on Carlsen's part, which ultimately led to his decision to relinquish the title.\n\n**Candidates Tournament 2022**\n\nThe Candidates Tournament 2022 was held from June 16 to July 5, 2022, in Madrid, Spain. The tournament was a widely anticipated event, as it was seen as a major opportunity for players to challenge Magnus Carlsen's dominance of the chess world. The tournament was won by Ian Nepomniachtchi, who emerged victorious from a closely contested field.\n\n**Results**\n\nThe Candidates Tournament 2022 was a 14-round round-robin tournament, with each player facing every other player once.

The match was a 14-round match, with a classical time control of 120 minutes for the first 40 moves, followed by 60 minutes for the next 20 moves, and finally 15 minutes for the remainder of the game, with a 30-second increment from move 1.\n\n**Organization**\n\nThe championship match was organized by the World Chess Federation (FIDE), with the help of the German Chess Federation.

The historiography of this period is characterized by a wide range of approaches, perspectives, and interpretations, reflecting the diversity of sources and the complexity of the events themselves.\n\nHistory\n\nOf historiography\n\nThe study of the Christianization of the Roman Empire has undergone significant changes over the centuries. In the early Middle Ages, Christian historians such as Eusebius and Augustine of Hippo wrote accounts of the period that emphasized the triumph of Christianity over paganism. These accounts were often hagiographic, presenting the early Christian martyrs and saints as heroes who had risked their lives to spread the Gospel.\n\nIn the Renaissance and Enlightenment periods, historians such as Edward Gibbon and Voltaire approached the topic with a more critical and skeptical eye. They saw the Christianization of the Roman Empire as a gradual process, driven by social and economic factors rather than divine intervention.\n\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries, historians such as Adolf Harnack and Ramsay MacMullen developed more nuanced and comprehensive accounts of the period. They emphasized the importance of social and cultural factors, such as the decline of the Roman aristocracy and the rise of Christianity as a popular movement.\n\nRoman religion\n\nContext and other evidence\n\nThe Roman Empire was a polytheistic society, with a complex pantheon of gods and goddesses. The Roman state played an active role in promoting the cult of the gods, and temples and shrines were built throughout the empire to honor the gods.\n\nHowever, the Roman Empire was also a society in transition. The decline of the Roman aristocracy and the rise of Christianity as a popular movement created a power vacuum that was filled by the Christian churches. The Christian churches began to promote their own cult of saints and martyrs, which eventually became a central part of the Christian faith.\n\nSpread of Christianity\n\nOrigin\n\nThe origins of Christianity are shrouded in mystery, and there is ongoing debate among historians and scholars about the exact circumstances of its emergence. Some historians believe that Christianity emerged as a Jewish sect in the 1st century AD, while others believe that it emerged as a separate movement in the 2nd century AD.\n\nReception and growth in Roman society\n\nChristianity was initially received with skepticism and hostility by the Roman authorities. However, as the movement grew in popularity and influence, it began to attract the attention of Roman emperors and aristocrats.\n\nUnder Constantine and his Christian successors\n\nThe conversion of Constantine to Christianity in the 4th century AD marked a significant turning point in the history of the Roman Empire. Constantine and his successors began to promote Christianity as the official state religion, and the Christian churches began to build grand cathedrals and basilicas throughout the empire.\n\nTheodosius I\n\nTheodosius I, who ruled the Roman Empire from 378 to 395 AD, was the first Christian emperor to impose Christianity as the official state religion. He issued a series of laws and edicts that promoted the Christian faith and persecuted paganism.\n\nTheodosius II and Pope Leo I\n\nTheodosius II, who ruled the Roman Empire from 408 to 450 AD, continued the Christianization of the Roman Empire begun by his father. He issued a series of laws and edicts that promoted the Christian faith and persecuted paganism.\n\nSixth to eighth centuries\n\nThe Christianization of the Roman Empire continued throughout the 6th to 8th centuries AD. The Christian churches became increasingly influential and powerful, and the Roman Empire became a Christian empire.\n\nMathematical modelling\n\nMathematical models have been developed to study the spread of Christianity throughout the Roman Empire. These models take into account factors such as population density, migration patterns, and social and economic factors.\n\nPossible reasons for a top-down spread\n\nTraditional conflict models\n\nThe traditional conflict model posits that the spread of Christianity was driven by conflict and violence between Christians and pagans.

This model emphasizes the role of the Christian churches in promoting social and economic equality and in addressing the needs of the poor.\n\nInfluence of legislation\n\nThe legislation model posits that the spread of Christianity was driven by the influence of legislation and policy. This model emphasizes the role of the Roman emperors and the Christian churches in promoting Christianity through legislation and policy.\n\nPossible reasons for a grassroots spread\n\nNew ideas\n\nThe new ideas model posits that the spread of Christianity was driven by new ideas and cultural changes.

The election was a significant event in the state's political landscape, marking the first election after the death of former Chief Minister and senior leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Lalji Tandon.\n\n# Background\n\n## Local body elections\n\nThe 2022 Gujarat Legislative Assembly election was held concurrently with the local body elections in the state. The local body elections, which included the elections to the six municipal corporations and 31 district panchayats, were a crucial aspect of the election. The results of the local body elections were seen as a precursor to the Assembly election, as they provided insights into the voter sentiment and preferences.\n\n# Schedule\n\nThe 2022 Gujarat Legislative Assembly election was held in two phases, with the first phase covering 89 constituencies on December 1, 2022, and the second phase covering the remaining 93 constituencies on December 5, 2022. The election schedule was announced by the Election Commission of India (ECI) on October 30, 2022.\n\n# Election statistics\n\nThe 2022 Gujarat Legislative Assembly election saw a significant voter turnout, with over 67% of the eligible voters casting their votes. The total number of voters was approximately 4.9 crore, with the number of voters in the 18-19 age group being the highest. The average age of the voters was around 38 years.\n\n# Parties and alliances\n\n## Bharatiya Janata Party\n\nThe Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was the ruling party in the state and was seeking to retain power. The party had been in power for three consecutive terms and had a strong presence in the state. The party's campaign focused on the development and progress made during its tenure, as well as the achievements of the incumbent Chief Minister, Bhupendra Patel.\n\n## United Progressive Alliance\n\nThe United Progressive Alliance (UPA) was an alliance of opposition parties, including the Indian National Congress (INC), the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). The alliance was seeking to unseat the BJP and form the next government. The UPA's campaign focused on the issues of corruption, unemployment, and inequality, as well as the alleged failures of the BJP government.\n\n## Aam Aadmi Party\n\nThe Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) was a key player in the election, with the party's national convener and Delhi Chief Minister, Arvind Kejriwal, campaigning in the state.

He is considered one of the most important philosophers of the ancient world, and his ideas had a profound impact on the development of Western philosophy, particularly in the areas of metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics.\n\n**Biography**\n\nPlotinus was born in Lycopolis, Egypt, to a Greek family. His early life is not well-documented, but it is believed that he was educated in Alexandria, where he was exposed to the teachings of various philosophers, including Plato and Aristotle. In his early twenties, Plotinus traveled to Rome, where he became a student of the famous philosopher Ammonius Saccas.\n\n**Expedition to Persia and return to Rome**\n\nIn 242 AD, Plotinus joined the Roman Emperor Gordian III's expedition to Persia, where he hoped to meet with the Persian philosophers and gain a deeper understanding of their teachings. However, the expedition was ultimately unsuccessful, and Plotinus was forced to return to Rome. During his time in Persia, Plotinus was deeply influenced by the teachings of the Persian philosophers, particularly Mani, who is believed to have had a significant impact on his metaphysical and cosmological views.\n\n**Later life**\n\nAfter his return to Rome, Plotinus settled in Campania, where he founded a philosophical school. He attracted a large following of students, including women and men from all walks of life, and his teachings became known for their depth and spiritual significance. Plotinus's later life was marked by a growing emphasis on the mystical and the spiritual, and he is believed to have written extensively on these topics.\n\n**Major ideas**\n\nPlotinus's philosophy is characterized by a number of key concepts, including:\n\n### **The One**\n\nThe One is the ultimate reality, the source of all being and existence. It is beyond human comprehension and is the object of Plotinus's philosophical and spiritual quest. The One is not a personal deity, but rather a unified, undifferentiated reality that underlies all of existence.\n\n### **Emanation by the One**\n\nThe One is said to emanate a series of realms or levels of existence, including the Intellect, the Soul, and the material world. These realms are not separate entities, but rather different aspects of the One, each with its own unique characteristics and properties.\n\n### **The true human and happiness**\n\nPlotinus believed that the true human is the one who has achieved a state of spiritual enlightenment, in which they have transcended the limitations of the material world and have become one with the One. Happiness is not something that can be achieved through external means, but rather is a state of being that arises from a deep connection with the divine.\n\n### **Henosis**\n\nHenosis is the process of reunification with the One, in which the individual transcends their ego and becomes one with the ultimate reality. Henosis is the ultimate goal of Plotinus's philosophy and is seen as the key to achieving spiritual enlightenment and happiness.\n\n**Relation with contemporary philosophy and religion**\n\nPlotinus's philosophy was heavily influenced by the teachings of Plato, and he is often seen as a key figure in the development of Neoplatonism. Plotinus's views on the nature of the One and the process of emanation were also influenced by the teachings of the Persian philosophers, particularly Mani.\n\n### **Plotinus's Relation to Plato**\n\nPlotinus was deeply influenced by Plato's philosophy, particularly in the areas of metaphysics and epistemology. However, Plotinus's views on the nature of the One and the process of emanation were more radical than those of Plato, and he is often seen as having moved beyond the philosophical framework established by his predecessor.\n\n### **Plotinus and the Gnostics**\n\nPlotinus's views on the nature of the One and the process of emanation were also influenced by the teachings of the Gnostics, who saw the material world as a prison or a trap created by the evil deity Sophia. Plotinus's views on the nature of the material world and the process of emanation were more nuanced than those of the Gnostics, and he is often seen as having moved beyond the philosophical framework established by his predecessors.\n\n### **Against causal astrology**\n\nPlotinus was also influenced by the teachings of the Stoics, particularly in the areas of ethics and cosmology. However, Plotinus was critical of the Stoic view of fate and the role of the stars in determining human destiny. He argued that the stars and planets do not determine human fate, but rather are simply aspects of the material world that reflect the underlying reality of the One.\n\n**Film studies**\n\nPlotinus's philosophy has been the subject of several film studies, including the 1972 film \"The Emperor and the Assassin\" directed by Luciano Cavalli, which explores the philosophical and spiritual themes of Plotinus's teachings.\n\n**Influence**\n\nPlotinus's philosophy has had a profound impact on the development of Western philosophy, particularly in the areas of metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics. His views on the nature of the One and the process of emanation have influenced many philosophers, including the Christian theologian Origen, the Islamic philosopher Avicenna, and the Jewish philosopher Maimonides.\n\n### **Ancient world**\n\nPlotinus's philosophy was heavily influenced by the teachings of the ancient Greek philosophers, particularly Plato and Aristotle. His views on the nature of the One and the process of emanation were also influenced by the teachings of the Persian philosophers, particularly Mani.\n\n### **Christianity**\n\nPlotinus's views on the nature of the One and the process of emanation were also influenced by the teachings of the early Christian theologians, particularly Origen, who saw the One as the source of all being and existence.\n\n### **Islam**\n\nPlotinus's views on the nature of the One and the process of emanation were also influenced by the teachings of the Islamic philosophers, particularly Avicenna, who saw the One as the source of all being and existence.\n\n### **Judaism**\n\nPlotinus's views on the nature of the One and the process of emanation were also influenced by the teachings of the Jewish philosophers, particularly Maimonides, who saw the One as the source of all being and existence.\n\n### **Renaissance**\n\nPlotinus's philosophy had a significant impact on the Renaissance, particularly in the areas of art and literature. His views on the nature of the One and the process of emanation were seen as a key influence on the work of artists such as Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci.\n\n### **Great Britain**\n\nPlotinus's philosophy also had a significant impact on the development of philosophy in Great Britain, particularly in the areas of metaphysics and epistemology.\n\n### **India**\n\nPlotinus's views on the nature of the One and the process of emanation were also influenced by the teachings of the Indian philosophers, particularly the Advaita Vedanta school, which sees the ultimate reality as a unified, undifferentiated reality that underlies all of existence.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Neoplatonism\n* Plato\n* Aristotle\n* Mani\n* Origen\n* Avicenna\n* Maimonides\n* Michelangelo\n* Leonardo da Vinci\n\n**Notes**\n\n* Plotinus's philosophy is characterized by a number of key concepts, including the One, emanation, the true human, and henosis.\n* Plotinus's views on the nature of the One and the process of emanation were heavily influenced by the teachings of Plato and the Persian philosophers.\n* Plotinus's philosophy had a profound impact on the development of Western philosophy, particularly in the areas of metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics.\n\n**References**\n\n* This article is based on the work of various philosophers and scholars, including Plotinus, Plato, Aristotle, Mani, Origen, Avicenna, Maimonides, Michelangelo, and Leonardo da Vinci.\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n* Plotinus, \"The Enneads\"\n* Plato, \"The Republic\"\n* Aristotle, \"Metaphysics\"\n* Mani, \"The Ginza\"\n* Origen, \"Against Celsus\"\n* Avicenna, \"The Metaphysics\"\n* Maimonides, \"The Guide for the Perplexed\"\n* Michelangelo, \"The Divine Comedy\"\n* Leonardo da Vinci, \"The Notebooks\"\n\n**External links**\n\n* Plotinus at the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy\n* Plotinus at the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\n* Plotinus at the Encyclopedia Britannica", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The battle was a key part of the larger Russian invasion of Ukraine, which began on 24 February 2022.\n\n**Background**\n\n### War in Donbas\n\nThe Donbas region, located in eastern Ukraine, has been a longstanding point of contention between Ukraine and Russia. The region has a significant Russian-speaking population, and many residents have expressed support for Russian President Vladimir Putin. The conflict in Donbas began in 2014, when pro-Russian separatists declared independence in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Ukraine and Russia have been at odds over the region's status ever since.\n\n### Prior operations\n\nIn the years leading up to the 2022 invasion, Ukraine and Russia engaged in a series of limited conflicts in the Donbas region. These conflicts often resulted in the deaths of Ukrainian soldiers and civilians, as well as the destruction of infrastructure. In 2021, tensions escalated, and Ukraine accused Russia of massing troops along its border.\n\n**Prelude**\n\n### Russian objectives\n\nRussia's primary objectives in the Donbas region were to:\n\n1. Capture the Donbas region and annex it into the Russian Federation.\n2. Establish a land corridor from Russia to the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia annexed in 2014.\n3. Weaken Ukraine's military and economy, making it easier for Russia to exert control over the country.\n\n**Opposing forces and foreign involvement**\n\n### Russian and pro-Russian forces\n\nThe Russian military, along with pro-Russian separatist groups, comprised the main force opposing the Ukrainian military.

The league is one of the oldest and most prominent regional football leagues in the state, with a rich history dating back to 1896.\n\n**History**\n\nThe Northern Riverina Football League was formed in 1896, with the first season being played in 1897. The league was initially composed of teams from the towns of Albury, Corowa, and Wangaratta. Over the years, the league has undergone several changes, including the addition and withdrawal of teams, as well as the introduction of new competitions and grades.\n\nIn the early years of the league, football was a popular sport in the Riverina region, with many teams competing in the league. However, during World War I, many players were involved in the conflict, and the league suffered as a result. The league resumed in 1919, but it was not until the 1920s that football began to gain popularity again.\n\nIn the 1930s, the league expanded to include teams from the surrounding areas, including the towns of Holbrook and Howlong. The league continued to grow and develop, with the introduction of new competitions and grades, including the women's football competition in the 1980s.\n\n**Current Clubs**\n\nThe Northern Riverina Football League currently consists of 12 teams, with each team representing a different town or region in the Riverina area. The teams are:\n\n1. Albury Bombers\n2. Corowa-Rutherglen Magpies\n3. Hume Cyclones\n4. Holbrook Tigers\n5. Howlong Eagles\n6. Lavington Hawks\n7. Murray Bushrangers\n8. North Albury Owls\n9. Thurgoona Bulldogs\n10. Wangaratta Rovers\n11. Wodonga Raiders\n12. Yenda Hawks\n\n**Previous Clubs**\n\nOver the years, the Northern Riverina Football League has had several teams withdraw from the competition. Some of the previous teams that have competed in the league include:\n\n1. Albury Boroughs (now Albury Bombers)\n2. Corowa Towns (now Corowa-Rutherglen Magpies)\n3. Howlong Towns (now Howlong Eagles)\n4. Lavington Magpies (now Lavington Hawks)\n5. Rutherglen (now Corowa-Rutherglen Magpies)\n6. Wangaratta (now Wangaratta Rovers)\n7.
