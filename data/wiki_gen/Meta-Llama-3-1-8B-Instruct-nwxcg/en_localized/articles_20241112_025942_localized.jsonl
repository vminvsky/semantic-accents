However, I can guide you through the process.\n\nHere's a comprehensive outline for the article on \"2022 Israeli legislative election\" along with explanations and details:\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe 2022 Israeli legislative election was a snap election held in the State of Israel on November 1, 2022, to elect the members of the 25th Knesset, the unicameral parliament of Israel. The election was called after the dissolution of the 24th Knesset on October 15, 2022. The election was the fifth in four years, following the 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 elections. The election was marked by a high level of polarization and fragmentation, with several parties competing for seats in the Knesset.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe 2022 election was a result of the collapse of the government formed by Prime Minister Naftali Bennett in June 2021. The government was a fragile coalition of eight parties, including the Likud, Shas, and United Torah Judaism, among others. However, the coalition began to unravel in August 2022, when two of its members, Bennett and then Defense Minister Benny Gantz, announced their intention to leave the government. The collapse of the government led to the dissolution of the 24th Knesset and the calling of a new election.\n\n**Campaign**\n\nThe campaign for the 2022 election was marked by a high level of polarization and fragmentation. Several parties competed for seats in the Knesset, including the Likud, Blue and White, Labor, and Meretz, among others. The campaign was also marked by a series of televised debates between the leaders of the various parties, including Prime Minister Bennett, opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu, and other party leaders.\n\n**Timeline**\n\n* October 15, 2022: The 24th Knesset is dissolved, and a new election is called.\n* October 24, 2022: The Central Election Committee announces the start of the campaign for the 2022 election.\n* November 1, 2022: The 2022 Israeli legislative election is held.\n* November 2, 2022: The results of the election are announced.\n* November 13, 2022: The Knesset is sworn in, and a new government is formed.\n\n**Electoral system**\n\nThe 2022 election was held under the Israeli system of proportional representation.

The system is also designed to ensure that smaller parties have a greater chance of winning seats in the Knesset.\n\n**Surplus-vote agreements**\n\nUnder the Israeli electoral system, surplus votes are distributed according to a system of surplus-vote agreements. These agreements are negotiated between parties before the election. The agreements determine how surplus votes are distributed, and they can significantly affect the outcome of the election.\n\n**Political parties**\n\nThe 2022 election saw the participation of several parties, including:\n\n* **Factions before the election**\n\t+ Likud: The Likud is a right-wing party that has been a major player in Israeli politics for decades.

Together, the trio embarks on a perilous journey through the multiverse, encountering various alternate versions of reality.

Union of India**\n\nThe Supreme Court of India's landmark judgment in Supriyo v. Union of India, delivered on November 17, 2022, has been a significant development in the country's LGBTQ+ rights movement. The case involved a petition by a same-sex couple seeking recognition of their marriage under the Indian Constitution. This article provides an in-depth analysis of the case, its background, and the implications of the court's ruling.\n\n**Case Summary**\n\nThe case was filed by a same-sex couple, Supriyo Kanungo and Anurag Banerjee, who had entered into a marriage in 2019 in Canada, which is a signatory to the United Nations Convention against Discrimination in Education and the European Convention on Human Rights. The petitioners approached the Supreme Court of India, seeking recognition of their marriage under the Indian Constitution, specifically Article 21, which guarantees the right to life and personal liberty, and Article 15, which prohibits discrimination on grounds of sex, place of birth, and other factors.\n\n**Intervenors**\n\n### Government\n\nThe Central Government of India intervened in the case, opposing the petitioners' claim. The Government argued that the Indian Constitution does not recognize same-sex marriages and that such recognition would be contrary to the country's cultural, social, and religious values.\n\n### Religious organisation\n\nThe Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind, a prominent Islamic organization in India, also intervened in the case. The organization argued that the Indian Constitution is based on the principles of Hinduism and that same-sex marriages are not recognized under Islamic law. The organization further argued that recognizing same-sex marriages would be a threat to the country's social and cultural values.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Indian Constitution, adopted in 1950, guarantees various fundamental rights to its citizens, including the right to life and personal liberty, the right to equality, and the right to freedom of expression. However, the Indian Penal Code, 1860, and the Special Marriage Act, 1954, do not recognize same-sex marriages. In 2009, the Delhi High Court delivered a landmark judgment in Naz Foundation v. Government of NCT of Delhi, which struck down Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, which criminalized same-sex relations. However, in 2013, the Supreme Court of India set aside the Delhi High Court's judgment, effectively reinstating Section 377.\n\n**Written Arguments**\n\n### Petitioners\n\nThe petitioners argued that the Indian Constitution guarantees the right to life and personal liberty, which includes the right to form a family and to marry. They further argued that the Indian government's opposition to same-sex marriages is based on discriminatory attitudes and stereotypes, which are not supported by scientific evidence. The petitioners also argued that recognizing same-sex marriages would promote equality, social inclusion, and human rights.\n\n#### Fundamental rights\n\nThe petitioners argued that the Indian Constitution guarantees various fundamental rights, including:\n\n*   **Jurisdiction**: The petitioners argued that the Indian Supreme Court has jurisdiction to hear and decide the case, as it involves a fundamental right guaranteed by the Indian Constitution.\n*   **Constitutional morality**: The petitioners argued that the Indian Constitution is based on the principles of equality, justice, and liberty, and that recognizing same-sex marriages would be consistent with these principles.\n*   **Right to equality**: The petitioners argued that the Indian Constitution guarantees the right to equality, which includes the right to form a family and to marry, regardless of sex or sexual orientation.\n*   **Anti-discrimination**: The petitioners argued that the Indian government's opposition to same-sex marriages is based on discriminatory attitudes and stereotypes, which are not supported by scientific evidence.\n*   **Freedom of expression**: The petitioners argued that the Indian Constitution guarantees the right to freedom of expression, which includes the right to express oneself in public and to form relationships.\n*   **Right to life and personal liberty**: The petitioners argued that the Indian Constitution guarantees the right to life and personal liberty, which includes the right to form a family and to marry.\n*   **Freedom of conscience and religion**: The petitioners argued that the Indian Constitution guarantees the right to freedom of conscience and religion, which includes the right to believe in and practice one's religion, free from coercion or interference.\n*   **Right to marry**: The petitioners argued that the Indian Constitution guarantees the right to marry, which includes the right to form a family and to have children.\n\n### Issues in secular marriage law\n\nThe petitioners argued that the Indian government's opposition to same-sex marriages is based on discriminatory attitudes and stereotypes, which are not supported by scientific evidence.

The company has undergone significant changes over the years, shaping its products and markets to meet the evolving needs of industries worldwide. This article provides an overview of Edwards Vacuum's history, products, and markets, as well as its notable initiatives and controversies.\n\n**History**\n\n### Independent (1919-1967)\n\nEdwards Vacuum was founded in 1919 by William Henry Edwards in the United States. Initially, the company focused on manufacturing vacuum pumps and other related equipment for the chemical industry. During the 1920s and 1930s, Edwards Vacuum expanded its product line to include vacuum systems for various applications, including research and development, manufacturing, and laboratory settings.\n\n### BOC (1968-2006)\n\nIn 1968, Edwards Vacuum was acquired by the British Oxygen Company (BOC), a leading industrial gas supplier. Under BOC's ownership, Edwards Vacuum continued to innovate and expand its product range. The company introduced new technologies, such as turbomolecular pumps, and established a strong presence in the global market.\n\n### Linde and CCMP Capital (2006-2014)\n\nIn 2006, BOC was acquired by The Linde Group, a German industrial gas company. Linde subsequently sold Edwards Vacuum to CCMP Capital, a private equity firm, in 2011. During this period, Edwards Vacuum continued to develop and market advanced vacuum technologies, including cryogenic and membrane-based systems.\n\n### Atlas Copco (2014-present)\n\nIn 2014, Atlas Copco, a Swedish industrial equipment manufacturer, acquired Edwards Vacuum from CCMP Capital. Under Atlas Copco's ownership, Edwards Vacuum has continued to expand its product line and geographic presence. The company has also invested in research and development, with a focus on innovative technologies and applications for the semiconductor, pharmaceutical, and chemical industries.\n\n**Products and Markets**\n\n### 1950-60s\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, Edwards Vacuum introduced several new products, including the first oil-sealed rotary vacuum pump and the first diffusion pump. These innovations helped establish the company as a leading manufacturer of vacuum equipment. During this period, Edwards Vacuum also expanded its product line to include vacuum systems for various applications, including research and development, manufacturing, and laboratory settings.\n\n### 1970s\n\nThe 1970s saw significant growth in the demand for vacuum equipment, driven by advances in semiconductor technology and the expansion of the chemical industry. Edwards Vacuum responded by introducing new products, such as turbomolecular pumps, and expanding its manufacturing capacity. The company also established a strong presence in the global market, with a network of distributors and sales offices worldwide.\n\n### 1980s\n\nIn the 1980s, Edwards Vacuum continued to innovate and expand its product line. The company introduced new technologies, such as cryogenic pumps, and established a strong presence in the market for semiconductor processing equipment. Edwards Vacuum also expanded its manufacturing capacity and established a network of research and development centers worldwide.\n\n### 1990s\n\nThe 1990s saw significant changes in the vacuum industry, driven by advances in semiconductor technology and the growth of the pharmaceutical industry. Edwards Vacuum responded by introducing new products, such as membrane-based systems, and expanding its manufacturing capacity. The company also established a strong presence in the market for pharmaceutical processing equipment.\n\n### Recent\n\nIn recent years, Edwards Vacuum has continued to innovate and expand its product line. The company has introduced new technologies, such as advanced turbomolecular pumps, and established a strong presence in the market for semiconductor processing equipment. Edwards Vacuum has also invested in research and development, with a focus on innovative technologies and applications for the semiconductor, pharmaceutical, and chemical industries.\n\n**Edwards Lecture Series**\n\nIn 2014, Edwards Vacuum established the Edwards Lecture Series, a program that brings together experts from industry, academia, and government to discuss the latest developments in vacuum science and technology. The series features lectures and panel discussions on topics such as semiconductor processing, pharmaceutical processing, and cryogenic technology.\n\n**Controversies**\n\n### Domain Registration\n\nIn 2019, Edwards Vacuum was involved in a controversy over the registration of its domain name. The company had registered the domain name \"edwardsvacuum.com\", but a third-party registrant had registered a similar domain name, \"edwardsvacuum.net\". Edwards Vacuum claimed that the registrant had engaged in typosquatting, a practice in which a registrant registers a domain name that is similar to a well-known brand name. The controversy was eventually resolved, but it highlighted the importance of domain name registration and trademark protection.\n\n### Hoffman Instrumentation Supply Inc\n\nIn 2018, Edwards Vacuum was sued by Hoffman Instrumentation Supply Inc, a distributor of vacuum equipment. The lawsuit alleged that Edwards Vacuum had breached its contract with the distributor and had engaged in unfair business practices. The lawsuit was eventually settled, but it highlighted the importance of contracts and business practices in the vacuum industry.\n\n**References**\n\nThis article provides a comprehensive overview of Edwards Vacuum's history, products, and markets.

The film is a live-action remake of the original, with a new cast and creative team. The story follows Ariel, a young mermaid who dreams of exploring the world above the sea and falls in love with Prince Eric, a human.\n\nPlot\n--------\n\nThe story follows Ariel, a young mermaid who lives in the underwater kingdom of Atlantica with her father, King Triton. Ariel is fascinated by the world above the sea and spends most of her time exploring the ocean floor, collecting human artifacts, and dreaming of one day experiencing life on land. When she falls in love with Prince Eric, a human who has rescued her from a shipwreck, Ariel makes a deal with the sea witch Ursula to trade her voice for a pair of legs, allowing her to meet Eric on land.\n\nHowever, things do not go as planned, and Ariel finds herself in a series of misadventures as she navigates the complexities of human life. Meanwhile, Ursula plots to take over the throne of Atlantica and marry Eric, using her magical powers to manipulate Ariel and Prince Eric into doing her bidding.\n\nCast\n-----\n\nThe film features a talented cast of actors, including:\n\n* Halle Bailey as Ariel\n* Jonathan Groff as Prince Eric\n* Melissa McCarthy as Ursula\n* Jacob Tremblay as Flounder\n* Awkwafina as Scuttle\n* Javier Bardem as King Triton\n* Daveed Diggs as Sebastian\n\nProduction\n-----------\n\n### Development\n\nThe project was first announced in 2018, with Rob Marshall set to direct and Lin-Manuel Miranda producing and writing the music.

The production team used a combination of practical and CGI effects to bring the underwater world to life.\n\n### Visual effects\n\nThe visual effects team used a range of techniques to create the underwater world, including motion capture, animation, and CGI. The film's color palette was designed to be bright and vibrant, with a focus on blues and greens to evoke the feeling of being underwater.\n\n### Lawsuit\n\nIn 2022, a lawsuit was filed against the film's producers, alleging that they had stolen the idea for the film from a 2015 script written by an amateur writer. The lawsuit was eventually dismissed, but not before causing a stir in the entertainment industry.\n\nMusic\n------\n\nThe film's music was written by Lin-Manuel Miranda, who also produced the film.

This approach helped to create a sense of realism and authenticity in the film.\n\n#### Character animation\n\nThe character animation for Sleeping Beauty was created by a team of skilled animators, including Eric Larson, Les Clark, and John Lounsbery. The animators used a combination of traditional techniques and new technology to bring the characters to life.\n\n### Music\n\nThe music for Sleeping Beauty was composed by George Bruns and adapted from a original score by Tchaikovsky. The film's soundtrack features a range of memorable and iconic songs, including \"Once Upon a Dream\" and \"Someday My Prince Will Come\".\n\n**Release**\n\n### Original theatrical run\n\nSleeping Beauty was released on January 29, 1959, at the Carthay Circle Theatre in Los Angeles, California.

The film has also been released on home video and DVD.\n\n### Home media\n\n#### Lawsuit\n\nIn the 1990s, a lawsuit was filed against Disney over the ownership of the film's soundtrack. The lawsuit claimed that the soundtrack was owned by a third party, and that Disney was infringing on their rights.\n\n**Reception**\n\n### Critical response\n\nSleeping Beauty received mixed reviews from critics at the time of its release. Some praised the film's animation and music, while others criticized its pacing and storyline.\n\n### Accolades\n\nSleeping Beauty has received several awards and nominations, including two Academy Award nominations for Best Original Song and Best Original Score.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nSleeping Beauty has had a lasting impact on popular culture, influencing countless other films, TV shows, and works of art.

This approach emphasizes the use of intuitionistic logic, which is a formal system that eschews the law of excluded middle and the axiom of choice in favor of a more constructive and computational approach.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nConstructive set theory is a response to the criticisms of classical set theory, which has been shown to be inconsistent and incomplete. Classical set theory, as formalized by Zermelo-Fraenkel (ZF), relies heavily on the axiom of choice and the law of excluded middle, which are not constructive principles. Constructive set theory, on the other hand, aims to provide a foundation for mathematics that is more intuitive and computational, and that avoids the pitfalls of classical set theory.\n\n**Constructive Outlook**\n\n### Preliminary on the use of intuitionistic logic\n\nIntuitionistic logic is a formal system that is based on the idea that mathematical truths are not simply a matter of logic, but rather a matter of constructive proof. In intuitionistic logic, a statement is considered true only if it can be proven constructively, i.e., by showing that it can be reduced to a known truth. This approach emphasizes the importance of computational methods and algorithms in mathematics.\n\n### Imposed restrictions on a set theory\n\nConstructive set theory imposes several restrictions on the classical ZF set theory. These restrictions include the abandonment of the axiom of choice and the law of excluded middle, as well as the rejection of the proposition that every property of a set is either true or false. Instead, constructive set theory uses a constructive approach to set theory, where sets are defined as collections of objects that are constructed by a series of operations.\n\n### Metalogic\n\nMetalogic is the study of the logical properties of formal systems, including set theory. Constructive set theory has a distinct metalogic that is based on intuitionistic logic and constructive methods. This metalogic is used to study the properties of sets and their relations, and to develop new set-theoretic concepts and techniques.\n\n### Anti-classical principles\n\nConstructive set theory is based on several anti-classical principles, including the rejection of the axiom of choice and the law of excluded middle. Additionally, constructive set theory rejects the idea that every property of a set is either true or false, and instead uses a constructive approach to set theory.\n\n**History and Overview**\n\n### Models\n\nConstructive set theory has been developed and studied in several different models, including the constructive Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (CZF) and the intuitionistic Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (IZF). These models provide a foundation for constructive mathematics and have been used to develop new set-theoretic concepts and techniques.\n\n**Notation**\n\n### Language\n\nThe language of constructive set theory is based on a constructive version of the ZF set theory. The language includes a set of basic symbols, such as the membership relation, the equality relation, and the propositional connectives.\n\n### Variables\n\nVariables in constructive set theory are used to represent sets and their properties. The variables are typically denoted by symbols such as x, y, and z.\n\n### Classes\n\nA class in constructive set theory is a collection of sets that satisfies a certain property or set of properties. Classes are used to define new set-theoretic concepts and to study the properties of sets and their relations.\n\n### Extensional equivalence\n\nExtensional equivalence is a relation between sets that is based on the idea that two sets are equivalent if they have the same elements.
