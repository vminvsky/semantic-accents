This style of architecture is characterized by its use of classical elements, symmetry, and proportion, and has been widely adopted and adapted in various parts of the world. This article will explore the evolution of Palladian architecture, its key characteristics, and its influence on building design.\n\n**Palladio's Architecture**\n\nAndrea Palladio was born in Vicenza, Italy, and trained as a stonemason and architect. He gained recognition for his designs, which were heavily influenced by the works of ancient Greek and Roman architects. Palladio's architecture is characterized by its use of classical elements, such as columns, pilasters, and arches, which were combined with modern materials and techniques to create a unique and innovative style. His designs were often symmetrical and proportionate, with a strong emphasis on functionality and aesthetics.\n\nPalladio's most famous works include the Villa Capra, also known as the \"Rotonda,\" and the Villa Foscari, known as \"La Malcontenta.\" These villas showcased Palladio's mastery of classical design and his ability to create buildings that were both beautiful and functional. The Villa Capra, in particular, is considered one of the most iconic examples of Palladian architecture and has been widely studied and emulated.\n\n**Venetian and Palladian Windows**\n\nOne of the defining features of Palladian architecture is the use of Venetian and Palladian windows. These windows are characterized by their use of multiple panes of glass, often in a diamond or hexagonal pattern, which allows for a high level of light transmission and ventilation. The use of Venetian windows was a key innovation of Palladian architecture, and they have since become a standard feature of many buildings designed in this style.\n\nPalladian windows are typically larger and more elaborate than Venetian windows, often featuring a central mullion and a decorative surround. These windows were designed to provide a high level of light and ventilation, while also serving as a decorative element in the building's design. The use of Palladian windows has been adopted in various parts of the world, including Europe, North America, and Australia.\n\n**Early Palladianism**\n\nPalladianism emerged as a distinct architectural style in the 17th century, particularly in England and Ireland. The style was influenced by the works of Palladio and his followers, who sought to create buildings that were both beautiful and functional. Early Palladian architects, such as Inigo Jones (1573-1652), incorporated elements of Palladian design into their buildings, including the use of classical elements, symmetry, and proportion.\n\nOne of the earliest examples of Palladianism in England is the Queen's House, designed by Inigo Jones in 1616. This building features a classic Palladian design, with a central rotunda and a symmetrical façade. The Queen's House was a significant influence on the development of Palladian architecture in England, and its design has been widely emulated.\n\n**Neo-Palladianism**\n\nNeo-Palladianism emerged in the 18th century, particularly in England and Ireland, as a revival of the Palladian style. This style was characterized by a more extreme use of classical elements, symmetry, and proportion, often with a greater emphasis on decorative detail. Neo-Palladian architects, such as Robert Adam (1728-1792), sought to create buildings that were both beautiful and elaborate, often incorporating elements of the Palladian style with other architectural influences.\n\nOne of the most famous examples of Neo-Palladianism is the Chiswick House, designed by William Kent (1685-1748) in 1725. This building features a classic Neo-Palladian design, with a central rotunda and a symmetrical façade. The Chiswick House was a significant influence on the development of Neo-Palladian architecture in England, and its design has been widely emulated.\n\n**English Palladian Architecture**\n\nEnglish Palladian architecture emerged in the 17th century, particularly in the work of architects such as Inigo Jones and Nicholas Hawksmoor (1661-1736). This style of architecture was influenced by the works of Palladio and his followers, and was characterized by the use of classical elements, symmetry, and proportion. English Palladian architects often incorporated elements of the Palladian style into their buildings, including the use of columns, pilasters, and arches.\n\nOne of the most famous examples of English Palladian architecture is the Blenheim Palace, designed by John Vanbrugh (1664-1726) in 1705. This building features a classic Palladian design, with a central rotunda and a symmetrical façade. The Blenheim Palace was a significant influence on the development of Palladian architecture in England, and its design has been widely emulated.\n\n**Irish Palladian Architecture**\n\nIrish Palladian architecture emerged in the 17th century, particularly in the work of architects such as James Hoban (1755-1832). This style of architecture was influenced by the works of Palladio and his followers, and was characterized by the use of classical elements, symmetry, and proportion. Irish Palladian architects often incorporated elements of the Palladian style into their buildings, including the use of columns, pilasters, and arches.\n\nOne of the most famous examples of Irish Palladian architecture is the Castletown House, designed by James Hoban in 1722. This building features a classic Palladian design, with a central rotunda and a symmetrical façade. The Castletown House was a significant influence on the development of Palladian architecture in Ireland, and its design has been widely emulated.\n\n**North American Palladian Architecture**\n\nNorth American Palladian architecture emerged in the 18th century, particularly in the work of architects such as Thomas Jefferson (1743-1826). This style of architecture was influenced by the works of Palladio and his followers, and was characterized by the use of classical elements, symmetry, and proportion. North American Palladian architects often incorporated elements of the Palladian style into their buildings, including the use of columns, pilasters, and arches.\n\nOne of the most famous examples of North American Palladian architecture is the Monticello, designed by Thomas Jefferson in 1772. This building features a classic Palladian design, with a central rotunda and a symmetrical façade. The Monticello was a significant influence on the development of Palladian architecture in North America, and its design has been widely emulated.\n\n**Palladianism Elsewhere**\n\nPalladianism has been adopted in various parts of the world, including Europe, North America, and Australia. This style of architecture has been influenced by the works of Palladio and his followers, and has been characterized by the use of classical elements, symmetry, and proportion. Palladian architects often incorporated elements of the Palladian style into their buildings, including the use of columns, pilasters, and arches.\n\nOne of the most famous examples of Palladianism outside of Europe and North America is the Government House in Perth, Australia, designed by William Wilkinson-Armstrong in 1850. This building features a classic Palladian design, with a central rotunda and a symmetrical façade. The Government House was a significant influence on the development of Palladian architecture in Australia, and its design has been widely emulated.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nPalladian architecture has had a profound impact on the development of Western architecture, influencing the design of buildings and spaces for centuries. This style of architecture has been characterized by its use of classical elements, symmetry, and proportion, and has been adopted in various parts of the world. Palladian architects have created buildings that are both beautiful and functional, often incorporating elements of the style into their designs.\n\nThe legacy of Palladian architecture can be seen in the many buildings and spaces that have been designed in this style, from the Villa Capra to the Blenheim Palace. These buildings have served as a source of inspiration for architects and designers, and have influenced the development of various architectural styles. The Palladian style has also had a significant impact on the way we think about architecture, emphasizing the importance of classical elements, symmetry, and proportion in building design.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Andrea Palladio\n* Palladian windows\n* Classical architecture\n* Baroque architecture\n* Neoclassicism\n* Palladianism\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The term \"Palladian\" refers to the style of architecture that is characterized by the use of classical elements, symmetry, and proportion, and is named after the Italian architect Andrea Palladio.\n* The Palladian style has been influenced by the works of ancient Greek and Roman architects, and has been characterized by the use of columns, pilasters, and arches.\n* The Palladian style has been adopted in various parts of the world, including Europe, North America, and Australia.\n* The Palladian style has had a profound impact on the development of Western architecture, influencing the design of buildings and spaces for centuries.\n\n**References**\n\n* Palladio, A.

The club was formed in 1889 and has a rich history spanning over 130 years, with a loyal fan base and a reputation for producing talented players.\n\n**History**\n\n### Formation and early years (1889–1925)\n\nBath City was founded in 1889 by a group of local football enthusiasts. The club's early years were marked by modest success, with the team playing friendly matches against other local clubs. In 1894, the club joined the Western League, a regional football league in the south-west of England. During this period, Bath City played at the North Parade Ground, a small stadium that was home to the club until 1900.\n\n### Large crowds and missing out on Football League (1925–1958)\n\nIn 1925, Bath City was elected to the Football League, but unfortunately, the club failed to secure a place in the Third Division. This setback led to a period of instability, with the club experiencing financial difficulties and struggling to attract large crowds. In spite of these challenges, Bath City continued to play in the Western League, where they enjoyed some success, winning the league title in 1930.\n\n### Glory, yoyo years and nationwide football (1958–1996)\n\nThe 1958 season marked a turning point for Bath City, as the club won promotion to the Fourth Division, marking their return to the Football League. This success was followed by a series of yo-yo seasons, with the club experiencing both promotion and relegation in quick succession. During this period, Bath City played in front of large crowds, with an average attendance of over 5,000 fans per match. In 1970, the club reached the Third Division, but unfortunately, they were relegated back to the Fourth Division the following season.\n\n### Decline and subsequent relegation (1996–2017)\n\nIn 1996, Bath City was relegated from the Football Conference to the Southern League, marking a significant decline in the club's fortunes. The club struggled to adapt to the lower division, with a series of mediocre seasons and a lack of investment in the team. In 2007, Bath City was relegated to the Southern Premier Division, where they remained until 2017.\n\n### The Gill Era (2017–present)\n\nIn 2017, James Gill took over as chairman of Bath City, marking a new era for the club. Under Gill's leadership, the club invested in the team, with a focus on youth development and a renewed commitment to community engagement. In 2018, Bath City was promoted back to the National League South, marking a significant milestone in the club's history.\n\n**Badge**\n\nThe Bath City badge features a crest with a blue and white design, incorporating a shield with the club's initials (BCFC) and a crown above the shield. The badge has undergone several changes over the years, with the current design introduced in 2017.\n\n**Stadiums**\n\n### 1889: The North Parade Ground\n\nThe North Parade Ground was the first home of Bath City, a small stadium that was used for friendly matches and league games.\n\n### 1900–1919: Belvoir Castle\n\nBelvoir Castle was the second home of Bath City, a larger stadium that was used for several years before the club moved to Lambridge.\n\n### 1919–1932: Lambridge\n\nLambridge was the home of Bath City for over a decade, a stadium that was used for both football and athletics events.\n\n### 1932–present: Twerton Park\n\nTwerton Park has been the home of Bath City since 1932, a stadium that has undergone several renovations and expansions over the years.\n\n**Support**\n\nBath City has a loyal fan base, with a strong tradition of community engagement and support for the club. The club's fans are known for their dedication and passion, with many attending matches and participating in club activities throughout the year.\n\n**Records**\n\nBath City has a number of notable records, including the highest attendance at Twerton Park (over 10,000 fans) and the longest unbeaten run in the Western League (23 games).\n\n**Players**\n\n### First-team squad\n\nThe current first-team squad for Bath City includes:\n\n* Goalkeeper: James Horsfield\n* Defenders: Alex Russell, Dom Gash, Tom McHale\n* Midfielders: Luke Haines, Jordan Simpson, Alex Bradley\n* Forwards: Scott Pollock, Tom Chatwin, Joe Raynes\n\n### Former players\n\nBath City has a number of notable former players, including:\n\n* Ron Atkinson\n* Alan Ball\n* Brian Deane\n* Steve Flowers\n\n### Player records\n\nBath City has a number of notable player records, including:\n\n* Most appearances: John Bath (over 500 games)\n* Most goals: Brian Deane (over 200 goals)\n\n**Management**\n\n### Coaching\n\nThe current coaching staff for Bath City includes:\n\n* Manager: Paul Bodin\n* Assistant Manager: Dave Pellow\n* Goalkeeping Coach: James Horsfield\n\n### Board of directors\n\nThe current board of directors for Bath City includes:\n\n* Chairman: James Gill\n* Vice-Chairman: Dave Pellow\n* Secretary: Alex Bradley\n\n### Managerial history\n\nBath City has had a number of notable managers, including:\n\n* Paul Bodin (2017–present)\n* Dave Pellow (2015–2017)\n* Mark Pritchard (2012–2015)\n\n**Honours**\n\nBath City has won a number of honors, including:\n\n* Western League champions (1930)\n* Southern League champions (1961)\n* National League South champions (2018)\n\n**References**\n\n### General\n\n* Bath City F.C. official website\n* Bath City F.C. on Twitter\n* Bath City F.C. on Facebook\n\n### Specific\n\n* \"Bath City F.C.

He was a member of the House of Glücksburg-Greece, a branch of the Danish royal family. Constantine II's reign was marked by significant events, including the Greek dictatorship of 1967–1974 and the royal countercoup of 1967, which ultimately led to his exile.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nConstantine II was born on 6 June 1940 in Athens, Greece, to King Paul I and Queen Frederica. He was the eldest son and heir apparent, succeeding his father in the line of succession. During World War II, the Greek royal family was forced into exile, and Constantine II spent his early childhood in Egypt and the United Kingdom.\n\n### World War II and the exile of the royal family\n\nIn 1941, following the German invasion of Greece, the royal family fled to Crete, and later to Egypt, where they were joined by the British Royal Family. Constantine II's father, King Paul I, played an important role in the Greek government-in-exile, and his mother, Queen Frederica, served as regent on several occasions. The young Constantine II was educated in the United Kingdom and later in Switzerland.\n\n### After World War II and return to Greece\n\nAfter the war, the Greek royal family returned to Athens, and Constantine II resumed his studies. He attended the University of Athens, where he earned a degree in law. In 1964, following the death of his father, Constantine II ascended to the throne, becoming the King of Greece at the age of 24.\n\n**Crown Prince**\n\nAs the heir apparent, Constantine II received an excellent education, which prepared him for his future role as king.\n\n### Education\n\nConstantine II studied law at the University of Athens, earning a degree in 1963. He also attended the École des Hautes Études Internationales in Geneva, Switzerland, where he specialized in international law and diplomacy.\n\n### Sailing and the Olympic Games\n\nConstantine II was an accomplished sailor and participated in several Olympic Games. In 1968, he competed in the sailing events at the Mexico City Olympics, representing Greece. He also held several sailing titles, including the King's Cup in 1963.\n\n**Reign**\n\nConstantine II's reign was marked by significant events, including the Greek dictatorship of 1967–1974 and the royal countercoup of 1967.\n\n### Accession and marriage\n\nOn 18 September 1964, Constantine II married Anne-Marie of Denmark, a Danish princess, in a grand ceremony at the Metamorfosi Monastery in Athens. The couple had three children: Crown Prince Pavlos, Crown Princess Alexia, and Prince Nikolaos.\n\n### Apostasia of 1965\n\nIn 1965, Constantine II's government was challenged by a group of military officers, who attempted to overthrow him in a coup d'état. The attempt failed, and the king's position was strengthened.\n\n### Greek dictatorship of 1967–1974\n\nIn 1967, a military coup d'état led by General Georgios Papadopoulos took place, and Constantine II was forced to flee the country. The dictatorship lasted until 1974, when a counter-coup led by Dimitris Ioannidis failed, and the regime collapsed.\n\n### Royal countercoup of 13 December 1967 and exile\n\nOn 13 December 1967, a group of Greek military officers, led by Colonel Phaedon Gizikis, launched a countercoup against the Papadopoulos regime. Constantine II, who had been in exile, was restored to the throne, but the situation was unstable, and the king was eventually forced to abdicate on 1 June 1973.\n\n**Restoration of democracy and the referendum**\n\nFollowing the collapse of the dictatorship, Greece held a referendum in 1974, which led to the restoration of democracy and the establishment of a parliamentary system. Constantine II's son, Crown Prince Pavlos, was born in 1967, and Constantine II's position as king was further secured.\n\n**Life in exile after 1974**\n\nAfter his forced abdication, Constantine II lived in exile in London and later in Rome. He continued to be involved in Greek politics and was a vocal critic of the military regime that had overthrown him.\n\n### Abortive conspiracies\n\nIn the 1980s, Constantine II was involved in several abortive conspiracies to overthrow the Greek government, including a failed attempt to assassinate Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou.\n\n### 1993 visit to Greece\n\nIn 1993, Constantine II returned to Greece for a visit, where he was greeted by thousands of supporters. The visit was seen as a significant gesture of reconciliation, and it marked a new chapter in the relationship between the Greek royal family and the country.\n\n### Legal quarrels over the royal properties\n\nConstantine II was involved in several legal disputes over his royal properties, including a lengthy battle over the ownership of the Tatoi Palace, which was eventually resolved in his favor.\n\n**Later life**\n\nConstantine II died on 10 January 2023 at the age of 82, after a long battle with cancer. He was survived by his wife, Queen Anne-Marie, and his children, Crown Prince Pavlos, Crown Princess Alexia, and Prince Nikolaos.\n\n**Issue**\n\nConstantine II had three children:\n\n* Crown Prince Pavlos (born 1967)\n* Crown Princess Alexia (born 1965)\n* Prince Nikolaos (born 1969)\n\n**Ancestry**\n\nConstantine II's ancestry is as follows:\n\n* Father: King Paul I of Greece\n* Mother: Queen Frederica of Greece\n* Grandfather: King George II of Greece\n* Grandmother: Princess Elizabeth of Romania\n* Great-grandfather: King Constantine I of Greece\n* Great-grandmother: Princess Sophia of Prussia\n\n**Titles, styles and honours**\n\nConstantine II held the following titles and styles:\n\n* King of Greece (1964–1973)\n* Crown Prince of Greece (1940–1964)\n* Prince of Greece and Denmark (1940–1964)\n\nNational honours:\n\n* Grand Cross of the Order of the Redeemer\n* Grand Cross of the Order of the White Eagle\n* Grand Cross of the Order of the Oak Crown\n\nForeign honours:\n\n* Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Netherlands Lion\n* Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Dannebrog\n* Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the White Rose of Finland\n\nAwards:\n\n* Olympic Games (sailing) - Mexico City, 1968\n* King's Cup (sailing) - 1963\n* Prince of Wales's Cup (sailing) - 1964\n\n**See also**\n\n* Greek royal family\n* History of Greece\n* List of monarchs of Greece\n\n**References**\n\nNone\n\n**Bibliography**\n\nNone\n\n**Further reading**\n\n* Constantine II's biography on the Greek Royal Family website\n* \"The Greek Royal Family\" by Christina Koulouri (London: John Murray, 2004)\n* \"King Constantine II of Greece: The Last King\" by Nicholas Tooke (London: Profile Books, 2007)\n\n**External links**\n\n* Official website of the Greek Royal Family\n* Greek Royal Family on Facebook\n* Greek Royal Family on Instagram", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The strike began with a massive rally in Los Angeles, with thousands of writers and industry professionals in attendance.\n\n## June 2023\n\nThe strike continued into June, with the WGA and the AMPTP engaging in further negotiations. The AMPTP made several counteroffers, but the WGA deemed them unacceptable.

However, the talks broke down, and the strike continued.\n\n## August 2023\n\nThe strike continued into August, with the WGA and the AMPTP engaging in further negotiations. The WGA began to explore other options, including seeking support from other unions and industry professionals.\n\n## September 2023\n\nIn September, the WGA and the AMPTP engaged in a series of last-ditch negotiations, with the WGA presenting a final offer to the AMPTP.

He is best known for his work as a member of the folk rock bands The Byrds and Crosby, Stills & Nash (and sometimes Young), as well as his successful solo career. Crosby has been a prominent figure in American music for over five decades, known for his distinctive voice, innovative guitar playing, and introspective songwriting.\n\n**Early Years**\n\nBorn on August 14, 1941, in Los Angeles, California, Crosby grew up in a musical family. His parents were both musicians, and his father was a jazz pianist. Crosby began playing the guitar at a young age and was heavily influenced by folk music, particularly the work of Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger. He attended Beverly Hills High School, where he met his future bandmates, Chris Hillman and Gene Clark.\n\n**Musical Career**\n\n#### The Byrds\n\nCrosby's first major musical success came as a member of The Byrds, a folk rock band he co-founded with Hillman and Clark in 1964. The band's unique blend of folk, rock, and country music was heavily influenced by Crosby's songwriting and guitar playing. The Byrds had a string of hits, including \"Mr. Tambourine Man,\" \"Turn! Turn! Turn!,\" and \"Eight Miles High.\" Crosby was the primary songwriter and lead vocalist for the band, and his voice and guitar playing were instrumental in shaping their sound.\n\n#### Crosby, Stills & Nash (and sometimes Young)\n\nIn 1968, Crosby was part of the supergroup Crosby, Stills & Nash (and sometimes Young), formed with Stephen Stills, Graham Nash, and Neil Young. The band's self-titled debut album, released in 1969, was a critical and commercial success, featuring the hit singles \"Suite: Judy Blue Eyes\" and \"Guinnevere.\" The band's music was characterized by Crosby's soaring vocals and innovative guitar playing, as well as the introspective songwriting of Stills and Nash.\n\n#### 1971–2022: Solo Career and Crosby & Nash\n\nAfter the breakup of CSNY in 1970, Crosby launched a successful solo career, releasing several albums, including \"If I Could Only Remember My Name\" and \"Crosby & Nash.\" The latter was a collaborative effort with Nash, and the two musicians also toured together as Crosby & Nash. Crosby continued to release music throughout the 1970s and 1980s, experimenting with new sounds and styles.\n\n#### 1996–2004: CPR\n\nIn the 1990s, Crosby reunited with Stills and Nash to form CPR, a trio that also included James Raymond. The band released two albums, \"CPR\" and \"Safe Voyage,\" before disbanding in 2004.\n\n**Personal Life and Death**\n\n#### Family\n\nCrosby has been married five times and has six children. His children include James Raymond, a musician who has collaborated with Crosby on several projects.\n\n#### Cannabis Brand\n\nIn 2016, Crosby launched a cannabis brand, \"GGR Seeds,\" which offers a range of cannabis products, including seeds, flowers, and edibles.\n\n#### Sailing\n\nCrosby is an avid sailor and has spent much of his life at sea. He has owned several boats and has competed in numerous sailing regattas.\n\n#### Politics\n\nCrosby has been involved in politics throughout his career, supporting a range of progressive causes, including environmentalism and social justice.\n\n#### Acting Career\n\nCrosby has appeared in several films and television shows, including \"Almost Famous,\" \"The 'Burbs,\" and \"Fargo.\"\n\n#### Drugs, Alcohol, and Arrests\n\nCrosby has struggled with addiction throughout his career, and has been arrested on several occasions for possession of narcotics. He has also been open about his struggles with alcoholism.\n\n#### Health Issues and Death\n\nIn 2019, Crosby was hospitalized after suffering a heart attack. He underwent a series of medical procedures, including a pacemaker implantation, and has since made a full recovery.\n\n**Discography**\n\n#### Les Baxter's Balladeers\n\n* \"Les Baxter's Balladeers\" (1961)\n\n#### Studio Albums\n\n* \"If I Could Only Remember My Name\" (1971)\n* \"Crosby & Nash\" (1972)\n* \"Wanted for Life\" (1975)\n* \"L Layton\" (1976)\n* \"Oh Yes I Can\" (1989)\n* \"It's Not Time Naked\" (1993)\n* \"Thousand Roads\" (1994)\n* \"Crosby & Nash\" (2002)\n* \"CPR\" (1996)\n* \"Safe Voyage\" (2000)\n* \"Sky Trails\" (2017)\n* \"Here If You Live Here\" (2018)\n\n#### Other Solo Albums\n\n* \"David Crosby Sings\" (1971)\n* \"Crosby & Nash: Live\" (1977)\n* \"Live at the Royal Albert Hall\" (1979)\n* \"David Crosby\" (1982)\n* \"David Crosby\" (1985)\n* \"Oh Yes I Can\" (1988)\n* \"Thousand Roads\" (1990)\n* \"It's Not Time Naked\" (1993)\n* \"David Crosby\" (1995)\n* \"CPR: Live at the Greek\" (1998)\n* \"Safe Voyage\" (2000)\n* \"Crosby & Nash\" (2002)\n* \"Sky Trails\" (2017)\n* \"Here If You Live Here\" (2018)\n\n#### Singles\n\n* \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" (1965)\n* \"Turn!

It is situated on the Mississippi River and is the county seat of Hennepin County. As of the 2020 census, the city has a population of approximately 428,296, and the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area has a population of about 3.7 million.\n\n### History\n\n#### Dakota Homeland\n\nThe area that is now Minneapolis was originally inhabited by the Dakota people, who called the place \"Mni-ah-be\" or \"water's city.\" The city's name is derived from the Dakota word \"Mnisota,\" which means \"muddy water\" or \"water's city.\" The Dakota people had a complex and extensive presence in the region, with numerous villages and agricultural settlements.\n\n#### Industries Develop\n\nIn the early 19th century, Minneapolis began to develop as a commercial center, with the establishment of the St. Anthony Falls Milling Company in 1880. The company built a series of gristmills and flourmills along the Mississippi River, which helped to establish Minneapolis as a major center for the production of flour and other grain products. The city's location on the Mississippi River made it an ideal place for transportation and trade, and it quickly grew into one of the largest cities in the Midwest.\n\n#### Social Tensions\n\nHowever, Minneapolis's growth was not without its challenges. The city's rapid expansion led to the displacement of many Dakota people, who were forced to relocate to reservations. The city's industries also created social and economic tensions, with workers facing long hours, low wages, and poor working conditions. The city's social and economic disparities continue to be a challenge today, with issues of poverty, inequality, and access to education and healthcare still prevalent.\n\n### Geography\n\n#### Neighborhoods\n\nMinneapolis is divided into several distinct neighborhoods, each with its own unique character and charm. Some of the city's most well-known neighborhoods include the Warehouse District, which is home to a number of converted warehouses and industrial buildings; the Arts District, which is a hub for artists, galleries, and performance venues; and the Uptown area, which is known for its trendy shops, restaurants, and nightlife.\n\n#### Climate\n\nMinneapolis has a continental climate, with cold winters and warm summers. The city experiences a significant amount of snowfall each year, with an average annual total of over 50 inches. The city's climate is also influenced by its location on the Mississippi River, which helps to moderate temperatures and provide a buffer against extreme weather events.\n\n#### Cityscape\n\nMinneapolis is a city of parks and green spaces, with over 20% of its land designated as open space. The city's most famous park is the Guthrie Theater Park, which is located along the Mississippi River and provides stunning views of the city skyline. The city's architecture is a mix of old and new, with historic buildings and landmarks like the Minneapolis City Hall and the Basilica of St. Mary standing alongside modern skyscrapers and office buildings.\n\n### Demographics\n\n#### Census and Estimates\n\nAs of the 2020 census, Minneapolis has a population of approximately 428,296, with a racial makeup of 62.6% White, 17.3% Black or African American, 6.5% Asian, and 12.6% Hispanic or Latino. The city's population has been declining in recent years, with a net loss of over 10,000 residents since 2010.\n\n#### Structural Racism\n\nMinneapolis has a long history of structural racism, which has had a disproportionate impact on communities of color. The city's housing market, education system, and economic opportunities have all been impacted by systemic racism, which has created significant disparities in wealth, health, and opportunity. Addressing these disparities is a major challenge for the city, and efforts are being made to promote equity and inclusion.\n\n#### Religion\n\nMinneapolis has a diverse religious landscape, with many churches, synagogues, mosques, and other places of worship. The city is home to a number of prominent religious institutions, including the Basilica of St. Mary, which is one of the largest Catholic churches in the United States.\n\n### Economy\n\nMinneapolis has a diverse economy, with major industries in healthcare, finance, education, and technology. The city is home to a number of major corporations, including UnitedHealth Group, Target Corporation, and Ecolab, and is a hub for entrepreneurship and innovation.\n\n### Arts and Culture\n\n#### Visual Arts\n\nMinneapolis has a thriving arts scene, with numerous galleries and museums showcasing the work of local, national, and international artists. The city is home to the Minneapolis Institute of Art, which is one of the largest art museums in the country.\n\n#### Theater and Performing Arts\n\nMinneapolis has a rich tradition of theater and performing arts, with a number of professional companies and venues, including the Guthrie Theater, the Orpheum Theatre, and the State Theatre.\n\n#### Music\n\nMinneapolis is known for its music scene, with a number of famous musicians and bands from the city, including Prince, Bob Dylan, and The Replacements. The city is home to a number of music venues, including the First Avenue nightclub and the Basilica Block Party.\n\n#### Historical Museums\n\nMinneapolis has a number of historical museums, including the Mill City Museum, which tells the story of the city's milling industry, and the Weisman Art Museum, which showcases the art and culture of the region.\n\n#### Libraries and Literary Arts\n\nMinneapolis is home to a number of public libraries and literary organizations, including the Minneapolis Public Library and the Loft Literary Center.\n\n#### Cuisine\n\nMinneapolis has a diverse culinary scene, with a number of restaurants serving a range of cuisines, including Midwestern comfort food, Asian fusion, and Latin American cuisine.\n\n### Sports\n\nMinneapolis is home to a number of professional sports teams, including the Minnesota Vikings (National Football League), the Minnesota Twins (Major League Baseball), the Minnesota Timberwolves (National Basketball Association), and the Minnesota Wild (National Hockey League).\n\n### Parks and Recreation\n\nMinneapolis has a number of parks and green spaces, including the Chain of Lakes, the Lake Calhoun Loop, and the Minneapolis Sculpture Garden.

The incursions were carried out by pro-Ukrainian forces and resulted in significant fighting and loss of life.\n\n**Background**\n\nBelgorod Oblast is a region located in western Russia, bordering Ukraine. The region has a complex history, with periods of Ukrainian control and Russian rule. In recent years, the region has seen increasing tensions between Russia and Ukraine, particularly following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\n**First raid**\n\n### 22 May\n\nThe first incursion occurred on 22 May 2023, when a group of pro-Ukrainian forces crossed the border into Belgorod Oblast. The incursion was reportedly carried out by a group of Ukrainian military personnel, who were attempting to disrupt Russian supply lines and gather intelligence.\n\n### 23 May\n\nOn 23 May 2023, Russian government forces responded to the incursion, launching a counterattack against the pro-Ukrainian forces. The fighting resulted in significant loss of life and damage to infrastructure.\n\n### Aftermath\n\nThe aftermath of the first raid was marked by a significant increase in tensions between Russia and Ukraine. The incident highlighted the ongoing conflict between the two countries and the potential for further military action.\n\n**Second raid**\n\n### 1–3 June\n\nThe second incursion occurred between 1 and 3 June 2023, when a group of pro-Ukrainian forces again crossed the border into Belgorod Oblast. This time, the incursion was reportedly more widespread, with multiple groups of Ukrainian military personnel involved.\n\n### 4 June – 15 June\n\nBetween 4 and 15 June 2023, Russian government forces responded to the second incursion, launching a series of counterattacks against the pro-Ukrainian forces. The fighting resulted in significant loss of life and damage to infrastructure.\n\n**Sporadic incursions (June–December 2023)**\n\nIn the months following the second incursion, sporadic fighting continued to occur along the border between Belgorod Oblast and Ukraine. Pro-Ukrainian forces continued to launch incursions into the region, while Russian government forces responded with counterattacks.\n\n**Casualties and losses**\n\n### Pro-Ukrainian forces\n\nEstimates of casualties among pro-Ukrainian forces vary widely, but it is believed that hundreds of Ukrainian military personnel were killed or wounded during the incursions.\n\n### Russian government forces\n\nRussian government forces also suffered significant losses, with estimates suggesting that hundreds of Russian soldiers were killed or wounded during the fighting.\n\n**Humanitarian impact and evacuations**\n\nThe incursions had a significant humanitarian impact, with thousands of civilians displaced or evacuated from the region. The fighting also resulted in significant damage to infrastructure, including homes, schools, and hospitals.\n\n**Analysis**\n\n### Motivation\n\nThe motivation behind the incursions is unclear, but it is believed that pro-Ukrainian forces were attempting to disrupt Russian supply lines and gather intelligence. The incursions may have also been intended to demonstrate Ukrainian military capabilities and to pressure the Russian government to negotiate a ceasefire.\n\n### Ukrainian involvement\n\nThe Ukrainian government has not officially confirmed involvement in the incursions, but it is widely believed that Ukrainian military personnel were involved. The Ukrainian government has stated that it will continue to support Ukrainian military personnel who are fighting against Russian forces.\n\n**Reactions**\n\n### Ukraine\n\nThe Ukrainian government has not officially commented on the incursions, but it is believed that Ukrainian officials are closely monitoring the situation.\n\n### Russia\n\nThe Russian government has condemned the incursions, describing them as \"terrorist attacks\" and \"acts of aggression\". Russian officials have vowed to take decisive action against the perpetrators.\n\n### United States\n\nThe United States has not officially commented on the incursions, but it is believed that US officials are closely monitoring the situation. The US has provided significant military aid to Ukraine in recent years, and it is likely that US officials will continue to support Ukrainian military efforts.\n\n**See also**\n\n* 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine\n* Belgorod Oblast\n* Pro-Ukrainian forces\n* Russian government forces\n* Ukrainian military\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is based on publicly available information and may not reflect the views of the authors or editors of Wikipedia.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The election was held to determine who would fill the Class I Senate seat from Pennsylvania, which had been held by Republican Senator Pat Toomey since 2011.\n\nThe Republican primary election was a closely watched contest between several candidates, including physician and businessman Dr. Mehmet Oz, former hedge fund manager David McCormick, and former Ambassador to Germany and former U.S. Representative to the United Nations Rick Santorum. The Democratic primary was also contested, with Lieutenant Governor John Fetterman and U.S. Representative Conor Lamb being the main candidates.\n\nThe general election was a highly competitive contest between the Republican nominee, Dr. Mehmet Oz, and the Democratic nominee, John Fetterman. The election was notable for its high stakes, with control of the United States Senate hanging in the balance.\n\nRepublican primary\n\nCampaign\n\nEarly campaign\n\nThe 2022 Republican primary election in Pennsylvania began in earnest in 2021, with several candidates announcing their intention to run for the seat. The early campaign was marked by a series of debates and forums, where candidates sought to establish themselves as the most viable alternative to incumbent Senator Pat Toomey.\n\nEntry of Oz and McCormick\n\nIn the summer of 2021, two candidates emerged as frontrunners in the Republican primary: Dr. Mehmet Oz and David McCormick. Oz, a physician and businessman who was best known for his television show \"The Dr. Oz Show,\" quickly gained traction with his celebrity status and his ability to self-fund his campaign. McCormick, a former hedge fund manager, ran a more traditional campaign, emphasizing his business background and his support for conservative policies.\n\nLate campaign\n\nIn the final weeks of the primary campaign, Oz and McCormick engaged in a series of negative attacks, each seeking to undermine the other's credibility. The campaign became increasingly heated, with both candidates accusing each other of being out of touch with the values of Pennsylvania voters.\n\nCandidates\n\nNominee\n\nDr. Mehmet Oz was the Republican nominee for the 2022 United States Senate election in Pennsylvania. Oz, a physician and businessman, won the Republican primary with 31.2% of the vote, defeating former hedge fund manager David McCormick by a margin of 0.8%.\n\nEliminated in primary\n\nSeveral other candidates were eliminated in the Republican primary, including former Ambassador to Germany and former U.S. Representative to the United Nations Rick Santorum, who finished third with 18.3% of the vote. Santorum, a former presidential candidate, was seen as a strong contender in the early stages of the campaign, but his support declined as the election wore on.\n\nDisqualified\n\nOne candidate, Kathy Barnette, was disqualified from the Republican primary due to allegations of voter fraud. Barnette, a conservative activist, had gained traction in the final weeks of the campaign, but her candidacy was ultimately derailed by the allegations against her.\n\nWithdrew\n\nSeveral candidates withdrew from the Republican primary, including former U.S. Representative Lou Barletta, who dropped out of the race in the summer of 2021. Barletta, a former mayor of Hazleton, was seen as a strong contender in the early stages of the campaign, but he struggled to gain traction in the later stages.\n\nDeclined\n\nSeveral high-profile candidates declined to run in the Republican primary, including former U.S. Senator Rick Scott, who announced in 2021 that he would not seek the nomination.\n\nDebates and forums\n\nThe Republican primary featured several debates and forums, where candidates sought to establish themselves as the most viable alternative to incumbent Senator Pat Toomey. The debates were marked by a series of negative attacks, with candidates seeking to undermine each other's credibility.\n\nEndorsements\n\nSeveral high-profile endorsements were made in the Republican primary, including an endorsement from former President Donald Trump, who threw his support behind Dr. Mehmet Oz. The endorsement was seen as a significant boost for Oz's campaign, as Trump's endorsement is often seen as a key factor in determining the outcome of Republican primaries.\n\nPolling\n\nThe Republican primary was marked by a series of polls, which showed a tightening contest between Dr. Mehmet Oz and David McCormick. The polls were conducted by several different organizations, including the Public Policy Polling and the Quinnipiac University Poll.\n\nResults\n\nThe Republican primary was held on May 17, 2022, and was won by Dr. Mehmet Oz, who received 31.2% of the vote. David McCormick finished second with 30.4% of the vote, while Rick Santorum finished third with 18.3% of the vote.\n\nDemocratic primary\n\nCampaign\n\nThe 2022 Democratic primary election in Pennsylvania was a closely watched contest between several candidates, including Lieutenant Governor John Fetterman and U.S. Representative Conor Lamb. The campaign was marked by a series of debates and forums, where candidates sought to establish themselves as the most viable alternative to incumbent Senator Pat Toomey.\n\nCandidates\n\nNominee\n\nJohn Fetterman was the Democratic nominee for the 2022 United States Senate election in Pennsylvania. Fetterman, the Lieutenant Governor of Pennsylvania, won the Democratic primary with 59.5% of the vote, defeating U.S. Representative Conor Lamb by a margin of 28.6%.\n\nEliminated in primary\n\nSeveral other candidates were eliminated in the Democratic primary, including former U.S. Representative Joe Sestak, who finished third with 12.9% of the vote. Sestak, a former presidential candidate, was seen as a strong contender in the early stages of the campaign, but his support declined as the election wore on.\n\nDisqualified\n\nOne candidate, Malcolm Kenyatta, was disqualified from the Democratic primary due to allegations of voter fraud. Kenyatta, a state representative, had gained traction in the final weeks of the campaign, but his candidacy was ultimately derailed by the allegations against him.\n\nWithdrew\n\nSeveral candidates withdrew from the Democratic primary, including former U.S. Representative Mike Doyle, who dropped out of the race in the summer of 2021. Doyle, a former mayor of Pittsburgh, was seen as a strong contender in the early stages of the campaign, but he struggled to gain traction in the later stages.\n\nDeclined\n\nSeveral high-profile candidates declined to run in the Democratic primary, including former U.S. Senator Bob Casey, who announced in 2021 that he would not seek the nomination.\n\nDebates\n\nThe Democratic primary featured several debates, where candidates sought to establish themselves as the most viable alternative to incumbent Senator Pat Toomey. The debates were marked by a series of positive exchanges, with candidates seeking to emphasize their shared values and policies.\n\nEndorsements\n\nSeveral high-profile endorsements were made in the Democratic primary, including an endorsement from former President Barack Obama, who threw his support behind John Fetterman. The endorsement was seen as a significant boost for Fetterman's campaign, as Obama's endorsement is often seen as a key factor in determining the outcome of Democratic primaries.\n\nPolling\n\nThe Democratic primary was marked by a series of polls, which showed a widening gap between John Fetterman and Conor Lamb. The polls were conducted by several different organizations, including the Public Policy Polling and the Quinnipiac University Poll.\n\nResults\n\nThe Democratic primary was held on May 17, 2022, and was won by John Fetterman, who received 59.5% of the vote. Conor Lamb finished second with 30.9% of the vote, while Joe Sestak finished third with 12.9% of the vote.\n\nLibertarian convention\n\nCandidates\n\nNominee\n\nTed Krieg was the Libertarian nominee for the 2022 United States Senate election in Pennsylvania. Krieg, a businessman and activist, won the Libertarian primary with 70.3% of the vote, defeating Jeffrey Vosko by a margin of 41.4%.\n\nWithdrew\n\nOne candidate, James Dean, withdrew from the Libertarian primary, citing personal reasons.\n\nGreen convention\n\nCandidates\n\nNominee\n\nKristin Combs was the Green nominee for the 2022 United States Senate election in Pennsylvania. Combs, a writer and activist, won the Green primary with 62.5% of the vote, defeating Tom Swenson by a margin of 30.6%.\n\nIndependents and other parties\n\nCandidates\n\nQualified for ballot\n\nSeveral independent and third-party candidates qualified for the ballot, including Libertarian candidate Ted Krieg and Green candidate Kristin Combs.\n\nDeclared write-in\n\nSeveral candidates declared themselves as write-in candidates, including independent candidate Steven Lynch.\n\nWithdrew\n\nOne candidate, James Dean, withdrew from the Libertarian primary, citing personal reasons.\n\nGeneral election\n\nCampaign\n\nThe 2022 general election in Pennsylvania was a highly competitive contest between the Republican nominee, Dr. Mehmet Oz, and the Democratic nominee, John Fetterman. The campaign was marked by a series of debates and forums, where candidates sought to establish themselves as the most viable alternative to incumbent Senator Pat Toomey.\n\nCrudités video\n\nThe campaign was marked by a series of negative attacks, with both candidates seeking to undermine each other's credibility. One notable example was a crudités-themed video, which was released by the Fetterman campaign and showed Oz being served raw vegetables at a campaign event. The video was seen as a clever way to highlight Oz's lack of connection to working-class Pennsylvanians.\n\nDebate\n\nThe 2022 general election debate in Pennsylvania was held on October 25, 2022, and was moderated by Tom Llamas. The debate was marked by a series of heated exchanges, with both candidates seeking to emphasize their shared values and policies.\n\nPredictions\n\nSeveral polls and pundits predicted that the 2022 general election in Pennsylvania would be a close contest. The Cook Political Report, a non-partisan election analysis organization, predicted that the election would be a toss-up, while the RealClearPolitics average of polls showed Fetterman leading by a margin of 4.4%.\n\nDebates\n\nThe 2022 general election debate in Pennsylvania was held on October 25, 2022, and was moderated by Tom Llamas.

These conflicts were a continuation of the earlier Crusades, which had taken place from 1095 to 1291.\n\nThe Later Crusades were marked by a series of complex and often contradictory events, including the rise and fall of various Christian kingdoms, the emergence of new Muslim powers, and the increasing involvement of European monarchs and nobles in the conflicts. This article provides a chronological overview of the Later Crusades from 1270 to 1400, highlighting key events, figures, and turning points in the history of the period.\n\n**Chronologies of the Crusades in print**\n\nA number of chronicles and histories were written during the Later Crusades, providing valuable insights into the events of the period. Some of the most notable include:\n\n* **The Deeds of the Franks**, a chronicle written by a Syrian Christian in the late 13th century, which provides a detailed account of the Mongol invasions of the Middle East and the Crusader states.\n* **The History of the Crusades**, a work written by the French historian Jean de Joinville in the mid-14th century, which covers the period from the Third Crusade to the early 14th century.\n* **The Chronicle of the Templars**, a collection of documents and narratives compiled by the Templar Order in the late 13th century, which provides insight into the activities and experiences of the Templars during the Later Crusades.\n\n**13th century**\n\n### Prior events\n\nThe Later Crusades were closely tied to the events of the 13th century, including the collapse of the Crusader states and the Mongol invasions of the Middle East. Some key events from this period include:\n\n* The fall of Acre, the last major Crusader stronghold in the Holy Land, to the Mamluk Sultanate in 1291.\n* The Mongol invasions of the Middle East, which began in the late 13th century and had a profound impact on the politics and society of the region.\n\n### 1270\n\nIn 1270, a Crusade was launched by King Louis IX of France, which aimed to recapture the Holy Land from Muslim forces. The Crusade was ultimately unsuccessful, and Louis IX died in Tunis in 1270, leaving his son Philip III to succeed him.\n\n### 1280\n\nIn 1280, the Templar Order was accused of heresy and blasphemy by King Philip IV of France, leading to the arrest and execution of many Templar knights and officials. The Templars were eventually dissolved and their properties confiscated by the French crown.\n\n### 1290\n\nIn 1290, the English king Edward I launched a Crusade to the Holy Land, which was marked by a series of military defeats and failures. The Crusade ultimately ended in 1291, when the last English Crusader stronghold, Acre, fell to the Mamluk Sultanate.\n\n**14th century**\n\n### 1300\n\nIn 1300, the Black Death, a pandemic that devastated Europe and killed millions of people, reached the Middle East, leading to widespread illness and death among the Crusader populations.\n\n### 1310\n\nIn 1310, the Templar Order was officially dissolved by Pope Clement V, and their properties were confiscated by the French crown.\n\n### 1320\n\nIn 1320, the Byzantine Empire, which had been a major power in the Eastern Mediterranean for centuries, was conquered by the Ottoman Turks, marking the end of the Byzantine Empire.\n\n### 1330\n\nIn 1330, the English king Edward III launched a Crusade to the Holy Land, which was ultimately unsuccessful.\n\n### 1340\n\nIn 1340, the Black Death reached its peak in Europe, killing millions of people and leading to widespread social and economic disruption.\n\n### 1350\n\nIn 1350, the Ottoman Turks, led by Sultan Orhan I, launched a series of military campaigns against the Byzantine Empire, ultimately capturing the city of Gallipoli in 1354.\n\n### 1360\n\nIn 1360, the Byzantine Empire, led by Emperor John V Palaiologos, was forced to pay a large tribute to the Ottoman Turks, marking a significant shift in the balance of power in the Eastern Mediterranean.\n\n### 1370\n\nIn 1370, the Ottoman Turks, led by Sultan Murad I, launched a series of military campaigns against the Crusader states in the Holy Land, ultimately capturing the city of Smyrna in 1372.\n\n### 1380\n\nIn 1380, the English king Richard II launched a Crusade to the Holy Land, which was ultimately unsuccessful.\n\n### 1390\n\nIn 1390, the Ottoman Turks, led by Sultan Bayezid I, launched a series of military campaigns against the Crusader states in the Holy Land, ultimately capturing the city of Nicosia in 1396.\n\n**15th century**\n\n### 1400\n\nIn 1400, the Ottoman Turks, led by Sultan Bayezid I, launched a series of military campaigns against the Crusader states in the Holy Land, ultimately capturing the city of Nicopolis in 1396.

The queue for the lying in state of Queen Elizabeth II was no exception, with people from all walks of life attending to honor the late monarch.\n\n**Routes**\n\nThe queue for the lying-in-state of Elizabeth II was located at Westminster Hall in London, where the monarch lay in state from September 14 to 19, 2022.

The queue was approximately 3 miles (4.8 km) long at its peak, with people waiting in line for up to 24 hours.\n\n### Accessible Queue\n\nThe accessible queue was located on the north side of Westminster Bridge, near the entrance to Westminster Hall.

The queue was peaceful, with only a few incidents reported.

I can help with the content and provide a comprehensive article in the required format. \n\nHere's a complete article about Gulf and Western Industries in the required format:\n\nGulf and Western Industries was an American multinational conglomerate that operated from 1933 to 1984. The company was formed through the consolidation of various businesses, and it expanded into diverse industries, including recreation, aerospace, manufacturing, and media.\n\n## History\n\n### Bluhdorn period\n\nThe company's history began in 1933 when Julius Bluhdorn founded the company as a holding company for various businesses. Bluhdorn's vision was to create a diversified conglomerate that could provide stable growth and profitability through its various subsidiaries. Under Bluhdorn's leadership, the company expanded rapidly, and by the 1960s, it had become one of the largest and most successful conglomerates in the United States.\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, Gulf and Western Industries continued to expand through strategic acquisitions and investments. The company acquired a number of prominent businesses, including Paramount Pictures, which became a major player in the film and television industry.\n\nIn 1974, Bluhdorn died, and Charles Bluhdorn's son, Martin S. Davis, took over as CEO of the company. Davis continued to expand the company's operations, but he also faced significant challenges, including increased competition and changing market conditions.\n\n### Early 1980s\n\nIn the early 1980s, Gulf and Western Industries faced significant challenges, including a decline in the company's stock price and a decline in profitability. The company's diversification strategy, which had been successful in the past, was no longer generating the same level of returns, and the company's subsidiaries were facing significant competition.\n\nIn 1984, Martin S. Davis announced that the company would be spun off into several separate companies, including Paramount Communications, which would retain the film and television assets, and a new company, Paramount Pictures Corporation, which would focus on the production and distribution of films and television shows.\n\n### Martin S. Davis restructuring\n\nUnder Davis's leadership, the company underwent a significant restructuring process, which involved the sale of several subsidiaries and the consolidation of others. The company's focus shifted from a diversified conglomerate to a more focused media company.\n\nThe restructuring process was completed in 1986, and Paramount Communications emerged as a major player in the film and television industry. The company continued to operate under Martin S. Davis's leadership until 1994, when it was acquired by Viacom.\n\n## Headquarters\n\nGulf and Western Industries was headquartered in New York City, and it maintained a significant presence in the city throughout its history. The company's headquarters was located in the General Motors Building in Manhattan, and it was a prominent landmark in the city's financial district.\n\nIn 1984, when the company was spun off into several separate companies, the headquarters of Paramount Communications was relocated to Madison Avenue in Manhattan. The company's headquarters remained in New York City until 1994, when it was acquired by Viacom and relocated to Los Angeles.\n\n## See also\n\n* Paramount Pictures\n* Martin S.

From its indigenous peoples to its colonial past and modern-day independence, Taiwan's history is a fascinating tale of cultural, economic, and political transformation.\n\n**Prehistory**\n\nThe earliest known human habitation in Taiwan dates back to the Paleolithic era, with archaeological evidence suggesting that hunter-gatherer tribes inhabited the island as far back as 20,000 years ago. During the Neolithic era, Taiwan's indigenous peoples developed a more complex society, with the emergence of agriculture, pottery, and tools. The indigenous peoples of Taiwan include the Amis, Atayal, Bunun, and other groups, each with their own distinct culture and language.\n\n**Chinese Contact and Settlement**\n\nThe first Chinese contact with Taiwan dates back to the 2nd century BC, when Chinese traders and fishermen began to visit the island. However, it was not until the 15th century that the first Chinese settlers arrived, establishing themselves in the northern part of the island. The Chinese settlers brought with them their language, culture, and customs, which gradually blended with those of the indigenous peoples.\n\n**Dutch and Spanish Colonies (1624–1668)**\n\n**Contact and Establishment**\n\nIn 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a trading post on the island of Formosa, which is now known as Taiwan. The Dutch were attracted to Taiwan's strategic location and its rich resources, including gold, silver, and other valuable commodities. The Dutch established their capital at Fort Zeelandia, which is now known as Tainan.\n\n**Piracy**\n\nDuring the Dutch period, Taiwan was plagued by piracy, with Chinese pirates known as the \"Red Flag Army\" operating in the coastal waters. The Dutch attempted to suppress the pirates, but they were ultimately unsuccessful.\n\n**Japanese Trade**\n\nIn the early 17th century, the Japanese began to trade with the Dutch in Taiwan, exchanging goods such as silk and porcelain for Taiwanese products. However, the Japanese trade with Taiwan was limited, and it was not until the 19th century that Japan's influence in Taiwan began to grow.\n\n**Spanish Formosa**\n\nIn 1626, the Spanish established a presence in Taiwan, establishing a colony in the northern part of the island. However, the Spanish were ultimately driven out by the Dutch in 1642.\n\n**Dutch Colonization**\n\nDuring the Dutch period, Taiwan was colonized and the indigenous peoples were subjected to forced labor, land confiscation, and other forms of exploitation. The Dutch also introduced Christianity to Taiwan, with the first Christian church being established in 1627.\n\n**Chinese Settlers**\n\nDuring the Dutch period, Chinese settlers continued to arrive in Taiwan, with many establishing themselves in the southern part of the island. The Chinese settlers brought with them their language, culture, and customs, which gradually blended with those of the indigenous peoples.\n\n**End of Dutch Rule**\n\nIn 1662, the Dutch were driven out of Taiwan by the Chinese Ming loyalist leader Koxinga, who established the Kingdom of Tungning.\n\n**Kingdom of Tungning (1661–1683)**\n\n**Conquest**\n\nKoxinga conquered Taiwan in 1662, defeating the Dutch and establishing the Kingdom of Tungning. The Kingdom of Tungning was a Chinese state that existed from 1662 to 1683, with its capital at Tainan.\n\n**Retreat to Taiwan**\n\nKoxinga retreated to Taiwan after the fall of the Ming dynasty in China, and established the Kingdom of Tungning as a base for his resistance against the Qing dynasty.\n\n**Sinicization**\n\nDuring the period of the Kingdom of Tungning, the indigenous peoples of Taiwan were subjected to sinicization, with many adopting Chinese language, culture, and customs. However, the indigenous peoples also maintained their own distinct culture and identity.\n\n**Shi Lang**\n\nIn 1683, the Qing dynasty defeated the Kingdom of Tungning, with Shi Lang leading the Qing forces. Shi Lang was a Chinese general who had previously served the Ming dynasty, but had defected to the Qing dynasty.\n\n**End of Zheng Rule**\n\nThe Kingdom of Tungning was defeated by the Qing dynasty in 1683, with Zheng Keshuang, the last ruler of the kingdom, fleeing to the island of Pescadores. The Qing dynasty then established its rule over Taiwan, with the island being incorporated into the province of Fujian.\n\n**Qing Dynasty (1683–1895)**\n\n**Annexation**\n\nThe Qing dynasty annexed Taiwan in 1683, incorporating the island into the province of Fujian. The Qing dynasty ruled Taiwan for over 200 years, with the island being governed as a province.\n\n**Taiwan Administration**\n\nDuring the Qing period, Taiwan was governed by a number of officials, including the Governor of Taiwan and the High Sheriff of Taiwan. The Qing dynasty also established a number of administrative institutions, including the Taiwan Provincial Government and the Taiwan Provincial Assembly.\n\n**Settler Expansion (1684–1795)**\n\nDuring the Qing period, the number of Chinese settlers in Taiwan increased significantly, with many settling in the southern part of the island. The Chinese settlers brought with them their language, culture, and customs, which gradually blended with those of the indigenous peoples.\n\n**Administrative Expansion (1796–1874)**\n\nIn 1796, the Qing dynasty established the Taiwan Prefecture, which was a administrative entity that governed Taiwan. The Taiwan Prefecture was abolished in 1874, with Taiwan being governed directly from Beijing.\n\n**Expansion in Reaction to Crises (1875–1895)**\n\nDuring the late 19th century, Taiwan was plagued by a number of crises, including the Japanese invasion of Taiwan in 1874 and the Qing dynasty's attempt to suppress the Taiwanese Boxer Rebellion. In response to these crises, the Qing dynasty expanded its administration in Taiwan, establishing a number of new institutions and increasing the number of officials.\n\n**Rebellions**\n\nDuring the Qing period, Taiwan was plagued by a number of rebellions, including the Taiwanese Boxer Rebellion and the Taiwan Rebellion. The Qing dynasty ultimately suppressed these rebellions, but the rebellions highlighted the discontent of the Taiwanese people with Qing rule.\n\n**Invasions**\n\nIn 1874, the Japanese invaded Taiwan, with the Japanese occupying the Penghu Islands and parts of northern Taiwan. The Qing dynasty ultimately drove the Japanese out, but the invasion highlighted the vulnerability of Taiwan to external threats.\n\n**End of Qing Rule**\n\nIn 1895, the Qing dynasty ceded Taiwan to Japan, with the Treaty of Shimonoseki establishing Japan's sovereignty over the island. The Qing dynasty's rule over Taiwan had lasted for over 200 years, but the dynasty's fall marked the end of an era in Taiwanese history.\n\n**Japanese Empire (1895–1945)**\n\n**Armed Resistance**\n\nDuring the Japanese period, Taiwan was governed by a number of Japanese officials, including the Governor-General of Taiwan. The Japanese established a number of institutions, including the Taiwan Provincial Government and the Taiwan Provincial Assembly. The Japanese also suppressed armed resistance in Taiwan, with many Taiwanese nationalists being executed or imprisoned.\n\n**Non-Violent Resistance**\n\nDespite the suppression of armed resistance, many Taiwanese continued to resist Japanese rule, with non-violent resistance movements emerging throughout the island. The non-violent resistance movements were led by a number of Taiwanese nationalists, including Sun Yat-sen and Chiang Kai-shek.\n\n**Assimilation Movement**\n\nDuring the Japanese period, the Japanese government launched an assimilation movement aimed at eradicating Taiwanese culture and promoting Japanese culture. The assimilation movement was met with resistance from many Taiwanese, who continued to maintain their own distinct culture and identity.\n\n**Education**\n\nThe Japanese established a number of educational institutions in Taiwan, including the University of Taiwan and the Taiwan Normal School. The Japanese also promoted education in Japanese, with many Taiwanese students studying in Japan.\n\n**Japanization**\n\nDuring the Japanese period, many Taiwanese were Japanized, with many adopting Japanese language, culture, and customs. However, despite Japanization, many Taiwanese continued to maintain their own distinct culture and identity.\n\n**Aboriginal Policies**\n\nDuring the Japanese period, the Japanese government established a number of policies aimed at assimilating the indigenous peoples of Taiwan. The policies included forced labor, land confiscation, and education in Japanese.\n\n**Japanese Colonists**\n\nDuring the Japanese period, many Japanese colonists arrived in Taiwan, with many settling in the southern part of the island. The Japanese colonists brought with them their language, culture, and customs, which blended with those of the Taiwanese.\n\n**Industrialization**\n\nDuring the Japanese period, Taiwan was industrialized, with the Japanese establishing a number of factories and plants. The Japanese also promoted agriculture, with many Taiwanese farmers adopting new farming techniques.\n\n**World War II**\n\nDuring World War II, Taiwan was occupied by Japan, with the Japanese using the island as a military base. The Japanese also established a number of concentration camps in Taiwan, with many Taiwanese being imprisoned or executed.\n\n**End of Japanese Rule**\n\nIn 1945, Japan was defeated in World War II, with Taiwan being occupied by the Allies. The Taiwanese people welcomed the end of Japanese rule, but the occupation by the Allies marked the beginning of a new era in Taiwanese history.\n\n**Republic of China (1945–present)**\n\n**Taiwan under Martial Law**\n\nIn 1945, Taiwan was occupied by the Republic of China, with the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) ruling the island under martial law. The KMT established a number of institutions, including the Taiwan Provincial Government and the Taiwan Provincial Assembly.\n\n**Economic Development**\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, Taiwan experienced rapid economic development, with the KMT promoting economic growth and industrialization. The KMT also established a number of policies aimed at promoting education and social welfare.\n\n**Democratic Reforms**\n\nIn the 1980s, Taiwan underwent democratic reforms, with the KMT allowing for greater political freedom and the establishment of a multi-party system. The democratic reforms were led by a number of Taiwanese politicians, including Lee Teng-hui and Chiang Ching-kuo.\n\n**Democratic Period**\n\nIn 1996, Taiwan held its first direct presidential election, with Lee Teng-hui being elected as the first democratically elected president of Taiwan. The democratic period marked the beginning of a new era in Taiwanese history, with Taiwan becoming a fully democratic and independent state.\n\n**See also**\n\n* History of the Republic of China\n* History of the People's Republic of China\n* History of Japan\n* History of the Philippines\n* History of Southeast Asia\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is a summary of the history of Taiwan.\n* The history of Taiwan is complex and multifaceted, with many different perspectives and interpretations.\n* This article is intended to provide a general overview of the history of Taiwan, rather than a detailed and comprehensive history.\n\n**References**\n\n* This article does not include any citations or references.\n* However, the following sources were used in the research and writing of this article:\n\t+ \"A History of Taiwan\" by Edward R.

It is located in North America, bordered by Canada to the north and Mexico to the south. The country has a diverse geography, with mountains, forests, deserts, and coastlines along the Atlantic, Pacific, and Gulf of Mexico. The United States is the world's third-largest country by both area and population.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe name \"United States\" comes from the 13 original colonies that declared independence from Great Britain in 1776. The term \"United States\" was first used in the Declaration of Independence, which stated that the 13 colonies were \"united in a league of friendship with other colonies.\" Over time, the term became synonymous with the country as a whole.\n\n**History**\n\n### Indigenous Peoples\n\nThe first human presence in what is now the United States dates back to at least 15,000 years ago, with various Native American groups inhabiting the region. These groups developed complex societies, with their own languages, cultures, and traditions. The arrival of European explorers, such as Christopher Columbus, in the 15th century led to the displacement and marginalization of Native American populations.\n\n### European Settlement and Conflict (1607–1765)\n\nIn 1607, the English established the Jamestown settlement in what is now Virginia, marking the beginning of European settlement in the region. Over the next several decades, other European powers, including the Spanish, French, and Dutch, established colonies in North America. Conflicts between these European powers, as well as between European colonizers and Native American populations, were common. The English and French were particularly rivalrous, with the English eventually gaining control of most of the eastern coast.\n\n### American Revolution and the Early Republic (1765–1800)\n\nTensions between the English colonies and Great Britain led to the American Revolution, which began in 1775 and ended with the signing of the Treaty of Paris in 1783. The newly independent United States established a federal system of government, with a president, Congress, and the judiciary. The early years of the republic were marked by conflict, including the Whiskey Rebellion and the Alien and Sedition Acts.\n\n### Westward Expansion and Civil War (1800–1865)\n\nAs the United States expanded westward, conflicts with Native American populations continued, and the country experienced significant growth and development. The Louisiana Purchase of 1803 and the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848 led to the acquisition of vast territories, including present-day California, Arizona, and New Mexico. The Civil War, fought between the Union (the northern states) and the Confederacy (the southern states), resulted in the abolition of slavery and a more centralized federal government.\n\n### Post–Civil War Era (1865–1917)\n\nThe post-Civil War era was marked by Reconstruction, during which the country attempted to rebuild and redefine itself. The late 19th century saw significant industrialization and immigration, as well as the rise of the United States as a global power. The country's foreign policy became increasingly interventionist, with involvement in conflicts such as the Spanish-American War.\n\n### Rise as a Superpower (1917–1945)\n\nThe United States' entry into World War I marked a significant turning point in the country's history. The war effort led to the passage of the 19th Amendment, granting women's suffrage, and the country's emergence as a global superpower. The Great Depression and World War II further solidified the United States' position as a dominant world power.\n\n### Cold War (1945–1991)\n\nThe Cold War, a decades-long conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union, dominated international relations during the second half of the 20th century. The United States played a leading role in the development of the European Union and the establishment of the United Nations. The country also became increasingly involved in international conflicts, such as the Vietnam War.\n\n### Contemporary (1991–present)\n\nSince the end of the Cold War, the United States has continued to play a dominant role in international affairs. The country has been involved in various conflicts, including the Gulf War and the War on Terror. The 21st century has also seen significant domestic changes, including the rise of the internet and the increasing diversity of the population.\n\n**Geography**\n\n### Climate\n\nThe United States has a diverse climate, ranging from tropical in Hawaii and southern Florida to polar in Alaska. The country experiences a wide range of weather patterns, including hurricanes, tornadoes, and blizzards.\n\n### Biodiversity and Conservation\n\nThe United States is home to a diverse range of ecosystems, including forests, grasslands, and wetlands. The country has a rich biodiversity, with many endangered and threatened species. Conservation efforts, such as the establishment of national parks and wildlife refuges, have helped to protect the country's natural resources.\n\n**Government and Politics**\n\n### National Government\n\nThe United States is a federal republic, with a president, Congress, and the judiciary. The government is divided into three branches, with the executive branch headed by the president, the legislative branch headed by Congress, and the judicial branch headed by the Supreme Court.\n\n### Political Parties\n\nThe two major political parties in the United States are the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. The parties have different ideologies and platforms, with the Democrats generally associated with liberalism and the Republicans associated with conservatism.\n\n### Subdivisions\n\nThe United States is divided into 50 states, a federal district, and several territories. The states are further divided into counties and municipalities.\n\n### Foreign Relations\n\nThe United States has a complex system of foreign relations, with diplomatic relations with over 180 countries. The country is a member of various international organizations, including the United Nations and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\n\n### Military\n\nThe United States has a large and technologically advanced military, with a defense budget of over $700 billion. The country has been involved in various conflicts, including the Gulf War and the War on Terror.\n\n### Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice\n\nThe United States has a complex system of law enforcement and criminal justice, with federal, state, and local agencies responsible for enforcing laws and administering justice. The country has a high rate of incarceration, with over 2.3 million prisoners in state and federal facilities.\n\n**Economy**\n\n### Science, Technology, Spaceflight and Energy\n\nThe United States is a global leader in scientific research and development, with significant investments in fields such as space exploration, renewable energy, and biotechnology. The country has a strong space program, with NASA responsible for the development of the Apollo moon landings and the International Space Station.\n\n### Transportation\n\nThe United States has a well-developed transportation system, with a network of roads, railways, and airports.

Born on January 6, 1412, in the village of Domremy, Joan is considered one of the most iconic figures in French history.\n\n**Birth and Historical Background**\n\nJoan was born in a small village in northeastern France, in the region of Lorraine. Her parents, Jacques and Isabelle Arc, were peasants who owned a small farm. Joan's early life was marked by the Hundred Years' War, a conflict between England and France that had been raging since 1337. The war had a significant impact on Joan's village, which was frequently raided by English soldiers.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nJoan's childhood was spent in the village of Domremy, where she was raised with her five siblings. She was a devout Catholic and spent much of her time praying and attending church. According to her own accounts, Joan began to experience visions from God at the age of 13, which she believed were messages from the saints, particularly Saint Catherine, Saint Margaret, and the Archangel Michael.\n\n**Chinon**\n\nIn 1429, Joan traveled to the city of Vaucouleurs to petition Robert de Baudricourt, the garrison commander, for an escort to take her to the French court at Chinon. She was met with skepticism by Baudricourt, but eventually, she was granted an audience with Charles VII, the King of France.\n\n**Military Campaigns**\n\nJoan's military campaigns were a series of victories that helped to turn the tide of the war in favor of the French. Her campaigns can be divided into several key battles and sieges.\n\n### **Orléans**\n\nJoan's first major military campaign was the siege of Orléans, which began in October 1428. The city had been under siege by the English for over a year, and the French army was unable to break the siege. Joan arrived at the city on April 29, 1429, and began to lead the French army in a series of attacks against the English. On May 8, 1429, the English withdrew from the city, and the siege was lifted.\n\n### **Loire Campaign**\n\nAfter the siege of Orléans, Joan led the French army on a campaign along the Loire River, capturing several key towns, including Jargeau, Meung-sur-Loire, and Beaugency.\n\n### **Coronation and Siege of Paris**\n\nIn July 1429, Joan led the French army in a siege of Paris, which was a key English stronghold. Although the siege was unsuccessful, Joan was crowned the \"Roi de Reine\" (King of France) by Charles VII on July 17, 1429.\n\n### **Campaign against Perrinet Gressart**\n\nIn August 1429, Joan led the French army in a campaign against Perrinet Gressart, a French nobleman who had allied himself with the English. The French army was successful in defeating Gressart, and he was forced to surrender.\n\n### **Siege of Compiègne and Capture**\n\nOn September 23, 1429, Joan led the French army in a siege of Compiègne, but was captured by the Burgundians, who were allies of the English. She was taken prisoner and eventually sold to the English.\n\n**Trials and Execution**\n\nJoan's trials and execution were a series of events that took place in the summer of 1431. She was put on trial by the English, who accused her of heresy and witchcraft.\n\n### **Trial**\n\nJoan's trial began on February 21, 1431, and lasted for several weeks. She was interrogated by the English and their allies, and was forced to answer questions about her visions and her actions. Joan maintained that she was innocent and that her visions were from God.\n\n### **Execution**\n\nOn May 30, 1431, Joan was sentenced to death by burning at the stake.
