It is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia.\n\n**Distribution**\n\nAnagyris foetida is found in the wild in countries including Algeria, Greece, Turkey, and Iran. It has been introduced to other regions, including parts of Europe and North America, where it can be found growing in disturbed areas, such as along roadsides and in abandoned fields.\n\n**Habitat**\n\nAnagyris foetida grows in a variety of habitats, including dry forests, scrublands, and rocky outcrops. It thrives in areas with full sun and well-drained soil.\n\n**Adaptations to growth in Winter and early Spring**\n\nAnagyris foetida has several adaptations that enable it to grow and thrive in the harsh conditions of winter and early spring.\n\n### Summer leaf-fall\n\nOne of the unique features of Anagyris foetida is its ability to drop its leaves during the summer months. This process, known as summer leaf-fall, allows the plant to conserve water and energy during the hot and dry summer months. The leaves regrow in the fall, when the weather becomes cooler and more humid.\n\n### Pollination by birds\n\nAnagyris foetida is pollinated by birds, which visit the plant's flowers in search of nectar. The flowers are rich in nectar, and the plant's fragrance is attractive to birds. The seeds are also an important food source for birds, particularly during the fall and winter months.\n\n**Seed dispersal**\n\nAnagyris foetida has several mechanisms for seed dispersal, including soil seed banks and olive mimicry.\n\n### Soil seed banks\n\nOne of the most important mechanisms for seed dispersal in Anagyris foetida is through soil seed banks. The seeds are able to survive in the soil for long periods of time, allowing the plant to colonize new areas and re-establish itself after disturbances.\n\n### Olive mimicry\n\nAnagyris foetida has a unique ability to mimic the appearance of an olive tree, allowing it to attract birds and other animals that are attracted to olives. The seeds are dispersed through the droppings of these animals, which can travel long distances and help to establish new populations of Anagyris foetida.\n\n### Role of sheep\n\nSheep also play an important role in the dispersal of Anagyris foetida seeds. Sheep are attracted to the plant's leaves and flowers, and the seeds are dispersed through their droppings. This process is particularly important in areas where sheep are common, such as in parts of Europe and Asia.\n\n### Other possible mammalian and avian vectors\n\nOther possible vectors for seed dispersal in Anagyris foetida include rabbits, rodents, and other small mammals. These animals may ingest the seeds and then deposit them in new locations, helping to establish new populations of the plant.\n\n### Unknown seed dispersal vector\n\nDespite its importance in seed dispersal, the role of unknown vectors in Anagyris foetida is not well understood. Further research is needed to determine the extent to which unknown vectors contribute to seed dispersal in this plant.\n\n### Tough, waterproof seed coats\n\nThe seeds of Anagyris foetida have tough, waterproof seed coats that help to protect them from the environment and allow them to survive for long periods of time. This adaptation is particularly important in areas where the plant is exposed to harsh weather conditions.\n\n**Value as a nitrogen-fixing pioneer and companion plant**\n\nAnagyris foetida is a nitrogen-fixing pioneer plant, meaning that it is able to fix atmospheric nitrogen into the soil in a form that is usable by other plants. This adaptation is particularly important in areas where the soil is poor in nutrients.

The company was founded in 2009 and has since become a leading player in the field of underwater exploration.\n\nBackground\n----------\n\nOceanGate's mission is to explore and preserve the world's oceans, with a focus on making the underwater world accessible to everyone. The company's vision is to create a fleet of state-of-the-art submersibles that can take people to the depths of the ocean, providing a unique and immersive experience.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n### 2009â2013: Founding and acquisition of Antipodes\n\nOceanGate was founded in 2009 by Stockton Rush, a veteran of the US Navy and a pioneer in the field of underwater exploration. The company's first submersible, the Antipodes, was acquired from a previous owner and underwent a major overhaul to make it seaworthy. The Antipodes was a small, spherical submersible capable of reaching depths of up to 400 feet (122 meters).\n\nDuring this period, Rush and his team began to develop a business plan for OceanGate, which would eventually become a leading player in the field of underwater exploration. The company's early years were marked by a series of test dives and demonstrations, which helped to establish OceanGate's reputation as a reliable and capable operator.\n\n### 2013â2016: Construction of Cyclops and SÃ¶hnlein's departure\n\nIn 2013, OceanGate began construction on a new submersible, the Cyclops 1. The Cyclops 1 was a larger and more advanced submersible than the Antipodes, with a maximum depth rating of 1,000 feet (305 meters). The submersible was designed for research and exploration, and featured a range of advanced sensors and equipment.\n\nDuring this period, OceanGate also began to expand its operations, with a series of dive trips to the Titanic wreck site. The company's first dive to the Titanic was in 2013, and was led by Stockton Rush himself.\n\n### 2016â2023: Expansion of fleet and dives to the Titanic\n\nIn 2016, OceanGate began construction on a new submersible, the Titan. The Titan was a massive submersible, capable of reaching depths of up to 12,500 feet (3,810 meters). The submersible was designed for deep-sea exploration, and featured a range of advanced sensors and equipment.\n\nDuring this period, OceanGate continued to expand its operations, with a series of dive trips to the Titanic wreck site. The company's dives to the Titanic were highly popular, and helped to establish OceanGate as a leading player in the field of underwater exploration.\n\n### 2023: Implosion of Titan and death of Rush\n\nOn June 18, 2023, the Titan submersible imploded during a dive to the Titanic wreck site, resulting in the deaths of all five people on board, including Stockton Rush. The incident was widely reported in the media, and raised questions about the safety of underwater exploration.\n\nSubmersibles\n------------\n\n### Antipodes\n\nThe Antipodes is a small, spherical submersible capable of reaching depths of up to 400 feet (122 meters). The submersible was acquired by OceanGate in 2009 and underwent a major overhaul to make it seaworthy.

The conflict has resulted in significant human suffering, economic losses, and a humanitarian crisis.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Post-Soviet Relations\n\nFollowing the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine and Russia established diplomatic relations. However, the two countries had differing views on several issues, including the status of Crimea and the Donbas region. Ukraine sought to maintain its independence and sovereignty, while Russia continued to exert influence over its former satellite states.\n\n### Ukrainian Revolution, Russian Intervention in Crimea and Donbas\n\nIn 2014, Ukraine experienced a revolution that resulted in the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych. Russia responded by annexing Crimea, a move that was widely condemned by the international community. In the Donbas region, Russian-backed separatists began to wage a guerrilla war against the Ukrainian government, leading to a protracted conflict that has resulted in thousands of deaths and widespread destruction.\n\n**Prelude**\n\n### Putin's Invasion Announcement\n\nOn 21 February 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a \"special military operation\" in Ukraine, marking the beginning of the invasion.

This phenomenon has occurred in various parts of the world, often due to civil wars, revolutions, or other forms of political upheaval. In such cases, the embassy's continued presence can serve as a symbol of stability and a connection to the international community.\n\nHistory\n\n### Russia (1917â1925)\n\nFollowing the Russian Revolution of 1917, the newly established Soviet government began to dissolve the Russian Empire's diplomatic missions. However, the Soviet government established its own diplomatic corps, which continued to operate in various countries. In some cases, the Soviet missions were able to maintain their presence in countries where the old Russian Empire's diplomatic corps had previously operated.\n\n#### Diplomatic missions after 1917\n\nAfter the Russian Revolution, many countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, withdrew their diplomatic missions from Russia or severely reduced their presence. However, the Soviet government was able to establish new diplomatic missions in these countries, which continued to operate despite the collapse of the Russian Empire.\n\nOne notable example is the Soviet embassy in Washington, D.C., which was established in 1933. The embassy played a crucial role in promoting Soviet interests in the United States and served as a symbol of Soviet diplomacy during the interwar period.\n\n#### Dissolution of the Soviet Union\n\nIn 1991, the Soviet Union dissolved, and Russia became an independent country. The Russian government inherited the Soviet Union's diplomatic corps and continued to operate many of the Soviet embassies and consulates. However, some countries, such as the United States, reduced their diplomatic presence in Russia following the dissolution of the Soviet Union.\n\n### Spain (1939â1977)\n\nDuring the Spanish Civil War, the Republican government's diplomatic missions were severely limited, and many countries withdrew their recognition of the Republican government. However, the Spanish Republic continued to maintain diplomatic relations with some countries, including the Soviet Union and Mexico.\n\n#### Diplomatic missions after 1939\n\nAfter the Nationalist victory in the Spanish Civil War, the new Spanish government, led by General Francisco Franco, established its own diplomatic corps. However, many countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom, reduced their diplomatic presence in Spain or withdrew their recognition of the Franco regime.\n\nDespite this, the Spanish embassy in Washington, D.C. continued to operate, and the Spanish government maintained diplomatic relations with some countries. However, the Spanish embassy was severely limited in its activities, and many countries did not recognize the Franco regime.\n\n### Poland (1939â1990)\n\nDuring World War II, Poland was occupied by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. The Polish government-in-exile continued to operate in London, and the Polish embassy there served as a symbol of Polish resistance against the Nazi and Soviet occupations.\n\n#### Diplomatic missions after 1939\n\nAfter the war, Poland became a Soviet satellite state, and the communist government established its own diplomatic corps. However, many countries, including the United States, reduced their diplomatic presence in Poland or withdrew their recognition of the communist government.\n\nDespite this, the Polish embassy in Washington, D.C. continued to operate, and the Polish government maintained diplomatic relations with some countries. However, the Polish embassy was severely limited in its activities, and many countries did not recognize the communist government.\n\n### Afghanistan (2021âpresent)\n\nIn 2021, the Taliban seized power in Afghanistan, and the country's government was dissolved. The United States and other countries withdrew their diplomatic missions from Afghanistan, and the country's embassy in Washington, D.C. was closed.\n\nHowever, the Afghan embassy in Washington, D.C. was reopened in 2022, and the Afghan government began to establish diplomatic relations with some countries. The embassy serves as a symbol of Afghan diplomacy and a connection to the international community.\n\nSee also\n\n* Diplomatic missions\n* Embassies\n* Governments in exile\n* International relations\n\nNotes\n\n* This article does not include a comprehensive list of all embassies without governments.

He is widely regarded as one of the most influential and iconic leaders of the 20th century. Before entering politics, Reagan had a successful career in the entertainment industry, where he worked as an actor, radio announcer, and film producer. He later transitioned to politics, serving as the Governor of California from 1967 to 1975 and as President of the United States from 1981 to 1989.\n\n**Early life**\n\nReagan was born on February 6, 1911, in Tampico, Illinois, to John Edward Reagan and Nelle Clyde Wilson Reagan.

He was commissioned as a second lieutenant and served as a lieutenant colonel in the Army Air Forces. Reagan was stationed in the Pacific Theater, where he was stationed on the island of Saipan. He was honorably discharged in 1945.\n\n### Screen Actors Guild presidency\n\nReagan served as the president of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) from 1947 to 1952 and again from 1959 to 1960. During his tenure, he advocated for fair wages and working conditions for actors, as well as the abolition of the Hollywood Blacklist.\n\n### Marriages and children\n\nReagan was married twice, first to Jane Wyman from 1940 to 1948, and then to Nancy Davis from 1952 until his death in 2004. He had two children, Patricia Ann (born 1941) and Ronald Prescott (born 1958).\n\n### Television\n\nReagan made numerous television appearances during his career, including a stint as the host of the popular TV show \"General Electric Theater\" (1954-1962). He also appeared on several other TV shows, including \"Wagon Train\" (1957) and \"The Untouchables\" (1960).\n\n**Early political activities**\n\n### 1966 California gubernatorial election\n\nReagan's first foray into politics was in the 1966 California gubernatorial election, in which he ran as a Republican against incumbent Governor Pat Brown. Reagan lost the election, but he gained national attention for his campaign, which focused on law and order and fiscal responsibility.\n\n**California governorship (1967â1975)**\n\nReagan was elected Governor of California in 1966, defeating incumbent Governor Pat Brown. He served two terms as governor, from 1967 to 1975. During his tenure, Reagan implemented a number of conservative policies, including tax cuts and deregulation. He also supported the construction of the California Aqueduct and the expansion of the state's highway system.\n\n**Seeking the presidency (1975â1981)**\n\nReagan began his campaign for the presidency in 1975, announcing his candidacy for the Republican nomination in November of that year. He won the nomination in 1980, defeating incumbent President Jimmy Carter in a landslide election.\n\n### 1976 Republican primaries\n\nReagan ran for the Republican nomination in 1976, but he lost to incumbent President Gerald Ford.

He believed that tax cuts would stimulate economic growth by allowing individuals and businesses to keep more of their earnings. He also believed in deregulation, arguing that it would increase competition and innovation.\n\n#### Taxation\n\nReagan's tax cuts were a major component of his economic policies.

By 1989, unemployment had fallen to under 5%.\n\n#### Government spending\n\nReagan's budget policies were designed to reduce government spending, particularly in areas such as welfare and social security. He believed that government spending was a major contributor to inflation and that it was necessary to reduce it in order to stimulate economic growth.\n\n#### Deregulation\n\nReagan's deregulation policies were designed to increase competition and innovation in areas such as transportation, energy, and finance. He believed that government regulation was often unnecessary and that it stifled competition and innovation.\n\n#### Deficits\n\nReagan's economic policies were also successful in reducing the budget deficit, which had risen to over $200 billion in 1980. By 1989, the deficit had fallen to under $150 billion.\n\n### Assassination attempt\n\nReagan was the target of an assassination attempt on March 30, 1981, just 69 days into his presidency.

He believed that public sector unions were essential to maintaining law and order and protecting public safety.\n\n### Civil rights\n\nReagan was a strong supporter of civil rights, particularly in areas such as affirmative action and equal employment opportunity. He believed that civil rights were essential to maintaining a just and equitable society.\n\n### War on drugs\n\nReagan was a strong supporter of the war on drugs, which was launched by his administration in 1982. He believed that the war on drugs was necessary to reduce crime and protect public safety.\n\n### Escalation of the Cold War\n\nReagan's presidency was marked by an escalation of the Cold War, particularly in areas such as military spending and nuclear policy. He believed that the Soviet Union was a major threat to American security and that it was necessary to increase military spending in order to counter this threat.\n\n### Invasion of Grenada\n\nReagan launched a military invasion of Grenada in 1983, which was a small island nation in the Caribbean. The invasion was designed to overthrow the socialist government of Grenada and to protect American medical students who were studying on the island.\n\n### 1984 election\n\nReagan was re-elected in 1984, defeating Democratic challenger Walter Mondale in a landslide election. He carried 49 states and won 525 electoral votes, while Mondale carried 1 state and won 13 electoral votes.\n\n### Response to the AIDS epidemic\n\nReagan's administration was criticized for its slow response to the AIDS epidemic, which was first identified in the 1980s. He was accused of being insensitive to the needs of those affected by the disease and of failing to provide adequate funding for research and treatment.\n\n### Addressing apartheid\n\nReagan's administration was criticized for its slow response to the issue of apartheid in South Africa. He was accused of failing to provide adequate pressure on the South African government to end its racist policies.\n\n### Libya bombing\n\nReagan launched a military bombing campaign against Libya in 1986, which was designed to retaliate against Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi for his support of terrorism.\n\n### Iran-Contra affair\n\nReagan's administration was embroiled in the Iran-Contra affair, which was a scandal that involved the secret sale of arms to Iran and the diversion of funds to support anti-Sandinista rebels in Nicaragua.\n\n### The USS Stark incident\n\nReagan's administration was criticized for its response to the USS Stark incident, which occurred in 1987 when an American ship was accidentally attacked by an Iraqi warplane. The incident resulted in the deaths of 37 American sailors.\n\n### Soviet decline and thaw in relations\n\nReagan's presidency was marked by a decline in Soviet power and influence, which was due in part to the economic policies of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. Reagan's administration was also marked by a thaw in relations between the United States and the Soviet Union, particularly in areas such as arms control and trade.\n\n**Post-presidency (1989â2004)**\n\n### Support for Brady Bill\n\nReagan was a strong supporter of the Brady Bill, which was a law that imposed waiting periods and background checks on gun buyers. He believed that the law was necessary to reduce gun violence and to protect public safety.\n\n### Alzheimer's disease\n\nReagan was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 1994 and gradually declined in health until his death in 2004. He died on June 5, 2004, at the age of 93.\n\n### Death and funeral\n\nReagan's funeral was held on June 11, 2004, at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California. He was buried on the grounds of the library, alongside his wife Nancy.\n\n**Legacy**\n\n### Historical reputation\n\nReagan's historical reputation is complex and multifaceted. He is widely regarded as one of the most influential and iconic leaders of the 20th century, but he is also criticized for his economic policies, which were seen as favoring the wealthy and large corporations. He is also criticized for his response to the AIDS epidemic and his handling of the Iran-Contra affair.\n\n### Political influence\n\nReagan's legacy continues to influence American politics, particularly in areas such as tax policy and social security. His economic policies have been adopted by many Republican politicians, and his approach to foreign policy has been followed by many American presidents.\n\n**Notes**\n\nThis article is based on a variety of sources, including books, articles, and primary materials.

Born in 1540 in Tavistock, Devon, England, Drake's life was marked by numerous voyages, military campaigns, and political endeavors that ultimately led to his knighthood and legendary status.\n\n**Birth and early years**\n\nLittle is known about Drake's early life, but it is believed that he was born to a family of modest means in Tavistock, Devon. His father, Edmund Drake, was a farmer and a local churchwarden, and his mother, Mary Mylwaye, was a member of a prominent local family. Francis Drake was the eldest of twelve children, and his family's economic circumstances would have likely influenced his early life and career choices.\n\nDrake received a basic education, likely at a local grammar school, and developed a strong interest in navigation and the sea. At the age of 13, he joined his uncle, John Drake, on a trading voyage to the Mediterranean, which would mark the beginning of his maritime career.\n\n**Early career at sea**\n\nDrake's early career at sea was marked by his involvement in the English slave trade. As a young man, he worked on various merchant vessels, including those involved in the transatlantic slave trade. It was during this period that he gained valuable experience in navigation, trade, and diplomacy.\n\n### Expedition of 1572-1573\n\nIn 1572, Drake led his first major expedition, a voyage to the Spanish West Indies. This expedition was intended to disrupt Spanish trade and gather intelligence on Spanish naval operations. The expedition was successful, and Drake returned to England with a significant amount of booty and valuable information.\n\n### Rathlin Island massacre\n\nIn 1573, Drake led a second expedition, this time to Rathlin Island off the coast of Ireland. The purpose of this expedition was to capture a Spanish galleon, but it ultimately ended in a massacre of Spanish prisoners on the island. This incident would later be cited as a factor in Drake's reputation as a ruthless and feared pirate.\n\n**Circumnavigation (1577-1580)**\n\nIn 1577, Drake embarked on his most famous voyage, a circumnavigation of the globe. This voyage was intended to disrupt Spanish trade and gather intelligence on Spanish naval operations. The voyage was a significant success, and Drake became the first Englishman to circumnavigate the globe.\n\n### Execution of Thomas Doughty\n\nDuring the voyage, a mutiny broke out, and Thomas Doughty, one of Drake's companions, was accused of treason. Doughty was put on trial and executed, which was a significant blow to Drake's reputation.\n\n### Entering the Pacific (1578)\n\nIn 1578, Drake entered the Pacific Ocean, becoming the first Englishman to do so. He sailed up the west coast of South America, raiding Spanish settlements and gathering intelligence on Spanish naval operations.\n\n### Raids on Spanish American west coast\n\nDrake's raids on the Spanish American west coast were successful, and he returned to England with a significant amount of booty and valuable information.\n\n### Coast of California: Nova Albion (1579)\n\nIn 1579, Drake sailed up the coast of California, which he named Nova Albion. He claimed the territory for England and left a plaque marking the English claim.\n\n### Across the Pacific and around Africa\n\nDrake sailed across the Pacific and around Africa, returning to England in 1580. He became a hero in England, and his reputation as a naval commander and explorer was cemented.\n\n### Return to Plymouth (1580)\n\nDrake returned to Plymouth, where he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth I for his services to the crown.\n\n### Knighthood and arms\n\nDrake was knighted in 1581, and his coat of arms was granted. His coat of arms featured a fox and a lion, which were symbols of his cunning and bravery.\n\n**Political career**\n\nDrake's political career began in the 1580s, when he was appointed to various naval and diplomatic positions by Queen Elizabeth I. He served as a member of the Privy Council and as a naval commander in various conflicts with Spain.\n\n### Great Expedition to America\n\nIn 1585, Drake led the Great Expedition to America, a voyage to the Caribbean and the Spanish Main. The expedition was intended to disrupt Spanish trade and gather intelligence on Spanish naval operations.\n\n### Conflict with the Spanish Armada\n\nIn 1588, Drake led the English fleet against the Spanish Armada, which was sent to invade England. The English fleet was victorious, and the Spanish Armada was defeated.\n\n### CÃ¡diz raid\n\nIn 1587, Drake led a raid on the Spanish port of CÃ¡diz, which was intended to disrupt Spanish trade and gather intelligence on Spanish naval operations.\n\n### Defeat of the Spanish Armada\n\nThe defeat of the Spanish Armada was a significant victory for Drake and the English navy. It marked the beginning of English naval supremacy and the decline of Spanish power.\n\n### English Armada\n\nIn 1596, Drake led the English Armada, a fleet sent to attack the Spanish Main. The expedition was successful, and Drake returned to England with a significant amount of booty and valuable information.\n\n**Defeats and death**\n\nDrake's final defeat came in 1596, when he was captured by the Spanish and imprisoned in Nombre de Dios. He died in prison on January 28, 1596, at the age of 55.\n\n**Family and heritage**\n\nDrake's family was prominent in England, and his legacy was cemented by his reputation as a naval commander and explorer. His descendants continued to serve in the English navy and government, and his name became synonymous with bravery and cunning.\n\n**Legacy and honours**\n\nDrake's legacy is still celebrated today, and his name is remembered as one of the greatest naval commanders and explorers in English history. He is honored in various monuments and institutions throughout England, including the Drake Collection at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich.\n\n### Geographical names\n\nDrake's voyages and expeditions resulted in the naming of various geographical features, including:\n\n* Drake Passage, a strait between Antarctica and South America\n* Drake Island, a small island off the coast of Antarctica\n* Drake Bay, a bay on the coast of California\n* Drake's Head, a headland on the coast of South Africa\n\n**See also**\n\n* English Navy\n* Spanish Navy\n* Privateering\n* Exploration\n* Piracy\n\n**References**\n\n* None\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n* Hakluyt, R.

It was not uncommon for Vice Presidents to receive and store classified documents in their private offices or homes. However, the discovery of the classified documents in Biden's possession has raised concerns about the security and accountability of the president's handling of sensitive information.\n\n**Discoveries and other developments**\n\n### First batch of documents\n\nOn November 2, 2022, it was reported that Biden's personal lawyers had discovered a batch of classified documents in a storage room in Biden's home in Wilmington, Delaware. The documents, which were said to be from Biden's time as Vice President, included material related to Ukraine, Iran, and China. The discovery of the documents was initially reported by The Washington Post.\n\n### DOJ letter to Bob Bauer\n\nOn January 9, 2023, it was reported that the Department of Justice (DOJ) had sent a letter to Bob Bauer, a lawyer for Biden, informing him that the DOJ had opened an investigation into the discovery of the classified documents. The letter was said to have included a request for information about the documents and their handling.\n\n### Second batch of documents\n\nOn January 12, 2023, it was reported that Biden's personal lawyers had discovered a second batch of classified documents in a garage attached to his home in Wilmington, Delaware. The documents, which were said to be from Biden's time as Vice President, included material related to Ukraine and Iran.\n\n### FBI search of Biden's Wilmington home\n\nOn January 20, 2023, it was reported that the FBI had searched Biden's home in Wilmington, Delaware as part of the ongoing investigation into the discovery of the classified documents. The search was said to have been conducted with the permission of Biden's personal lawyers.\n\n### Other searches\n\nIn addition to the search of Biden's home in Wilmington, Delaware, the FBI has also searched other locations associated with Biden, including his home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware and the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement in Washington, D.C.\n\n**Initial responses**\n\n### Biden and his legal team\n\nBiden and his legal team have maintained that the discovery of the classified documents was an accident and that they had taken steps to secure the documents as soon as they were discovered. Biden has also stated that he has cooperated fully with the investigation and that he is confident that the truth will come out.\n\n### Elected officials\n\n#### Republican elected officials\n\nRepublican elected officials have been quick to criticize Biden's handling of the classified documents. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has stated that the discovery of the documents raises \"serious questions\" about Biden's ability to handle classified information. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has also called for the appointment of a special counsel to investigate the matter.\n\n#### Democratic elected officials\n\nDemocratic elected officials have generally defended Biden and his handling of the classified documents. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has stated that the discovery of the documents was an \"oversight\" and that Biden has taken steps to secure the documents. House Majority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has also stated that the investigation is a \"witch hunt\" and that Biden has done nothing wrong.\n\n### Media analysis\n\nThe media has been quick to analyze the implications of the discovery of the classified documents. Many have raised questions about the security and accountability of the president's possession of sensitive information. Others have argued that the investigation is a partisan witch hunt and that Biden has done nothing wrong.\n\n### Misinformation\n\nThere has been some misinformation circulating about the discovery of the classified documents. Some have claimed that the documents were found in a secure facility, while others have claimed that the documents were destroyed. However, there is no evidence to support these claims.\n\n### Discovery of classified documents at Mike Pence's residence\n\nIn January 2023, it was reported that a search of former Vice President Mike Pence's residence had uncovered classified documents. The documents, which were said to be from Pence's time as Vice President, were turned over to the National Archives. The discovery of the documents has raised questions about the security and accountability of the president's possession of sensitive information.\n\n**Investigations**\n\n### Special counsel\n\nIn January 2023, it was reported that Attorney General Merrick Garland had appointed a special counsel to investigate the discovery of the classified documents. The special counsel, who was not named, was said to be a seasoned prosecutor with expertise in national security matters.\n\n### Decision that charges were unwarranted\n\nIn February 2023, it was reported that the special counsel had determined that charges were unwarranted in the case of the discovery of the classified documents. The decision was said to have been based on a careful review of the evidence and a consideration of the facts.\n\n### Comments on Biden's memory\n\nIn March 2023, it was reported that the special counsel had commented on Biden's memory in the case of the discovery of the classified documents. The special counsel was said to have noted that Biden's memory had been a factor in the case and that he had cooperated fully with the investigation.\n\n**Congressional**\n\nThe matter of the discovery of the classified documents has also been taken up by Congress. In February 2023, the House Oversight Committee held a hearing on the matter, during which lawmakers grilled Biden's personal lawyers about the discovery of the documents. The hearing was said to have been contentious and raised questions about the security and accountability of the president's possession of sensitive information.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Joe Biden\n* Classified information\n* National Archives\n* Department of Justice\n* Special counsel\n* Congressional investigation\n* House Oversight Committee\n* Senate intelligence committee", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

It was a brutal and intense conflict that lasted from 22 to 25 April 1951, resulting in significant losses on both sides.\n\nMilitary situation\n\nThe Korean Peninsula was divided along the 38th parallel, with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) to the north and the Republic of Korea (South Korea) to the south. In June 1950, North Korean forces, backed by China and the Soviet Union, invaded South Korea, prompting a United Nations coalition led by the United States to intervene on behalf of the South Koreans. By the spring of 1951, the war had become a stalemate, with both sides dug in along the Imjin River.\n\nChinese Spring Offensive\n\nIn April 1951, the Chinese launched a massive spring offensive, code-named \"Operation Rainbow,\" with the aim of driving the UNC forces back and reunifying the Korean Peninsula under communist control. The Chinese army, estimated to be around 300,000 strong, poured across the 38th parallel, overwhelming the South Korean and UNC forces.\n\nPreparations\n\nThe Australian 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (3 RAR), was one of the units tasked with defending the Kapyong Valley, a strategic location that controlled access to the Imjin River. The 3 RAR, supported by artillery and armor, had been preparing for the Chinese attack for weeks, digging in on Hill 504 and establishing a defensive perimeter.\n\nLaunch of Chinese Spring Offensive\n\nOn 22 April 1951, the Chinese army launched a massive assault on the 3 RAR's defensive position. The Chinese forces, estimated to be around 10,000 strong, poured into the valley, overwhelming the Australian unit. The 3 RAR fought bravely, but they were vastly outnumbered and outgunned.\n\nSouth Korean withdrawal, 22â23 April 1951\n\nAs the Chinese attack intensified, the South Korean 8th Division, which had been tasked with defending the Kapyong Valley, began to withdraw from the battlefield. The South Koreans, who had been poorly trained and equipped, were unable to hold their ground against the Chinese onslaught. By 23 April, the South Koreans had retreated from the valley, leaving the 3 RAR isolated and exposed.\n\nAustralian 3 RAR defence of Hill 504, 23â24 April 1951\n\nDespite being vastly outnumbered, the 3 RAR continued to defend Hill 504, fighting a desperate rearguard action against the Chinese army. The Australians, supported by artillery and armor, held out against the Chinese attack, inflicting significant casualties on their opponents.\n\nNight battle\n\nOn the night of 23 April, the Chinese launched a night attack on the 3 RAR's defensive position. The Australians, who had been exhausted by the previous day's fighting, were caught off guard by the Chinese assault. However, they quickly regrouped and launched a fierce counterattack, driving the Chinese back.\n\nDay battle\n\nThe next day, the Chinese launched a massive daylight attack on Hill 504. The Australians, who had been reinforced by artillery and armor, fought bravely against the Chinese onslaught. Despite being vastly outnumbered, the 3 RAR held out against the Chinese attack, inflicting significant casualties on their opponents.\n\n3 RAR withdraws\n\nOn 24 April, the 3 RAR, exhausted and depleted, began to withdraw from Hill 504. The Australians, who had fought bravely against overwhelming odds, had inflicted significant casualties on the Chinese army, but they had also suffered heavy losses themselves.\n\nCanadian 2 PPCLI last stand on Hill 677, 24â25 April 1951\n\nAs the 3 RAR withdrew from Hill 504, the Canadian 2nd Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry (2 PPCLI), took up a defensive position on Hill 677. The Canadians, who had been tasked with defending the Kapyong Valley, were vastly outnumbered and outgunned by the Chinese army.\n\nPreparations\n\nThe Canadians, supported by artillery and armor, began to prepare for the Chinese attack. They dug in on Hill 677, establishing a defensive perimeter and preparing for the inevitable assault.\n\nNight battle\n\nOn the night of 24 April, the Chinese launched a night attack on the 2 PPCLI's defensive position. The Canadians, who had been well-prepared, fought bravely against the Chinese onslaught. Despite being vastly outnumbered, the 2 PPCLI held out against the Chinese attack, inflicting significant casualties on their opponents.\n\nFinal 2 PPCLI Operations\n\nThe next day, the 2 PPCLI launched a final counterattack against the Chinese army.

They are one of the largest ethnic groups in Indonesia and have a distinct culture, language, and history that dates back thousands of years.\n\n**Origins and Antecedents**\n\n### Toalean â Pre-Austronesian South Sulawesi\n\nThe earliest known inhabitants of South Sulawesi were the Toalean people, who lived in the region from around 20,000 to 10,000 years ago. The Toalean culture is characterized by a unique set of tools, art, and architecture that differs from other ancient cultures in the region. Although the Toalean people are believed to have been part of the pre-Austronesian population of South Sulawesi, their exact relationship to the modern Bugis people is still a topic of debate among scholars.\n\n### The Arrival of Austronesians\n\nAround 10,000 years ago, Austronesian-speaking peoples began to migrate to South Sulawesi from the Philippines. These Austronesians brought with them their language, culture, and technology, which eventually blended with the existing Toalean culture. Over time, the Austronesians became the dominant population in the region, and their language and culture would eventually become the foundation of the modern Bugis identity.\n\n### Tana Ogi â Land of the Bugis\n\nThe name \"Bugis\" is believed to come from the word \"Tana Ogi,\" which means \"Land of the Bugis\" in the Bugis language. This name refers to the Bugis' ancestral homeland in the southwestern part of Sulawesi, where they developed their unique culture and traditions.\n\n**History**\n\n### Early Society\n\nThe early Bugis society was organized into small, autonomous chiefdoms, each with their own ruler and system of governance. These chiefdoms were often at odds with one another, leading to a complex system of alliances and rivalries that would shape the Bugis history for centuries to come.\n\n### The Growth of Bugis Kingdoms\n\nOver time, the Bugis chiefdoms began to coalesce into larger kingdoms, with the most powerful kingdom being the Kingdom of Gowa. The Kingdom of Gowa was founded in the 15th century and would go on to dominate the region for centuries, playing a major role in the politics and culture of South Sulawesi.\n\n### Emergence of New Political Strengths over the Peninsula\n\nAs the Kingdom of Gowa grew in power, new political strengths began to emerge in other parts of the peninsula. The Kingdom of Wajo, the Kingdom of Soppeng, and the Kingdom of Bone were among the most powerful kingdoms in the region, each with their own distinct culture and traditions.\n\n### Bugis-Makassar Society in the 16th Century\n\nBy the 16th century, the Bugis-Makassar society had become a complex and dynamic system, with a mix of indigenous and Islamic influences. The Bugis-Makassar people were known for their skills in trade, commerce, and warfare, and their society was characterized by a strong sense of community and social hierarchy.\n\n### Early Attempts to Christianize the Bugis States\n\nIn the 16th century, the Portuguese and the Spanish attempted to Christianize the Bugis states, but their efforts were met with resistance. The Bugis people were largely resistant to foreign influence, and their unique culture and traditions continued to thrive.\n\n### Quest for Prestige, Influence and Powers over the Peninsula\n\nThroughout the 17th and 18th centuries, the Bugis kingdoms continued to vie for prestige, influence, and power over the peninsula. The Kingdom of Gowa and the Kingdom of Wajo were among the most powerful kingdoms, with the Kingdom of Gowa eventually emerging as the dominant power in the region.\n\n### The Islamisation of Bugis-Makassar-Mandar\n\nBy the 17th century, Islam had become a major force in the Bugis-Makassar-Mandar region. The Islamisation of the Bugis people was led by Sultans and Islamic scholars, who brought with them their knowledge of Islamic law, customs, and traditions. The Islamisation of the Bugis people had a profound impact on their culture, language, and politics.\n\n### The Twilight of Dominance\n\nBy the 19th century, the Bugis kingdoms had begun to decline in power and influence. The Dutch colonial powers had established control over the region, and the Bugis people were forced to adapt to a new system of governance.\n\n### A New Golden Age\n\nDespite the decline of the Bugis kingdoms, the 20th century saw a resurgence of interest in Bugis culture and traditions. The Bugis people have continued to thrive, preserving their unique culture and traditions while adapting to the challenges of modern life.\n\n**Culture**\n\n### Language and Dialects\n\nThe Bugis language is a member of the Austronesian language family and is spoken by the Bugis people in the island of Sulawesi. There are several dialects of the Bugis language, each with its own distinct features and vocabulary.\n\n### Philosophy\n\nThe Bugis people have a rich philosophical tradition, with a strong emphasis on the concept of \"Tau-Tu-Batu,\" which refers to the interconnectedness of all things. The Bugis people believe in a complex system of causality and reciprocity, which underlies all aspects of their culture and society.\n\n### Traditional Script\n\nThe Bugis people have a unique script, known as the \"Lontara,\" which is used to write their language. The Lontara script is an abugida script, with a complex system of consonant-vowel combinations.\n\n### Folklore and Literary Traditions\n\nThe Bugis people have a rich folklore and literary tradition, with a focus on stories, legends, and myths. The Bugis people are known for their skill in storytelling and their use of oral traditions to pass down cultural knowledge and values.\n\n### Dress, Textiles and Weaving Traditions\n\nThe Bugis people are known for their beautiful textiles and weaving traditions. The Bugis people use a variety of techniques, including batik, weaving, and embroidery, to create intricate and beautiful designs.\n\n### Culinary Traditions\n\nThe Bugis people have a rich culinary tradition, with a focus on local ingredients and traditional cooking methods. The Bugis people are known for their use of spices, herbs, and other flavorings to create delicious and aromatic dishes.\n\n### Weaponry and Military Traditions\n\nThe Bugis people have a long history of martial tradition, with a focus on the use of traditional weapons, such as the \"Kris\" and the \"Parang.\" The Bugis people have a strong sense of military discipline and a proud tradition of warfare.\n\n### Traditional Architecture\n\nThe Bugis people have a unique architectural tradition, with a focus on traditional materials, such as wood, bamboo, and thatch. The Bugis people build complex and beautiful houses, palaces, and other structures, which reflect their rich cultural heritage.\n\n### Maritime, Mercantile and Migratory Traditions\n\nThe Bugis people have a long history of maritime, mercantile, and migratory traditions. The Bugis people have been skilled sailors, traders, and explorers, with a focus on the sea and the exchange of goods and ideas.\n\n### Rice and Agrarian Traditions\n\nThe Bugis people have a rich tradition of rice cultivation and agrarian practices.

She is the leader of the Brothers of Italy (Fratelli d'Italia) party, a right-wing populist party that has been a significant force in Italian politics since the 2010s.\n\nEarly life\n\nGiorgia Meloni was born on January 15, 1977, in Rome, Italy. Her father, Giuseppe Meloni, was a right-wing politician who served as a member of the Italian Communist Party (PCI) before switching to the Italian Republican Party (PRI). Meloni's mother, Elisabetta Flaminio, was a social worker.\n\nEducation and early political activism\n\nMeloni grew up in a family that was heavily involved in politics. She attended the Liceo Classico Enrico Mattei in Rome and later studied philosophy at the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart in Milan. During her university years, Meloni became increasingly involved in right-wing politics, joining the youth wing of the National Alliance (AN) party, a far-right party that was established in the 1990s.\n\nIn 1996, Meloni became the president of the AN's youth wing, Azione Giovane (Young Action), and quickly rose through the ranks of the party. She became a prominent figure in the AN, known for her conservative and nationalistic views.\n\nPolitical career\n\nMinister of Youth\n\nIn 2006, Meloni was elected to the Italian Parliament as a member of the National Alliance party.

Meloni's party formed a coalition government with the Lega and Forza Italia parties, with Meloni as the Prime Minister.\n\nPrime Minister of Italy\n\nGovernment formation\n\nOn October 22, 2022, Meloni was sworn in as the Prime Minister of Italy, becoming the first woman to hold the office. She formed a government with a coalition of the Brothers of Italy, Lega, and Forza Italia parties.\n\nDomestic policies\n\nAs Prime Minister, Meloni has implemented several domestic policies aimed at reducing immigration, increasing law and order, and promoting economic growth. She has also introduced measures to reduce the country's debt and promote small businesses.\n\nConstitutional reform\n\nMeloni's government has also proposed several constitutional reforms aimed at reducing the power of the President of the Republic and increasing the role of the Prime Minister. The reforms have been met with controversy and opposition from various groups.\n\nForeign policy\n\nAs Prime Minister, Meloni has taken a harder line on immigration and crime, calling for stricter border controls and increased cooperation with European Union member states to combat organized crime. She has also strengthened ties with the United States and other NATO member states.\n\nPolitical positions\n\nSocial issues\n\nMeloni has taken a conservative stance on social issues, opposing same-sex marriage and advocating for traditional family values. She has also been critical of the Italian government's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, questioning the effectiveness of lockdowns and mask mandates.\n\nFeminism\n\nMeloni has been a vocal critic of feminism, arguing that it has become a \"powerful ideology\" that seeks to \"impose a certain type of culture\" on society. She has also criticized the Italian government's policies aimed at promoting women's rights, saying that they are \"distracting\" and \"divisive\".\n\nImmigration and multiculturalism\n\nMeloni has taken a hardline stance on immigration, calling for stricter border controls and increased deportations. She has also criticized the Italian government's policies aimed at promoting multiculturalism, saying that they are \"conflictual\" and \"damaging\".\n\nForeign issues\n\nMeloni has taken a hawkish stance on foreign policy, advocating for increased military spending and a stronger NATO presence in Europe. She has also criticized the Italian government's handling of the Libyan crisis, saying that it has been \"inadequate\" and \"ineffective\".\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic and vaccines\n\nMeloni has been critical of the Italian government's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, questioning the effectiveness of lockdowns and mask mandates. She has also advocated for increased vaccination rates, but has also expressed concerns about the safety and efficacy of certain vaccines.\n\nRelationship with fascism\n\nMeloni has been accused of having a fascist ideology, a claim that she has denied. However, her party's manifesto and policies have been criticized for being reminiscent of fascist ideology. Meloni has also been criticized for her association with the far-right CasaPound movement, a group that has been accused of promoting fascist ideology.\n\nPersonal life\n\nMeloni is married to Matteo Salvini, the leader of the Lega party.

They are primarily adherents of Shia Islam, a branch of Islam that has its roots in the early Islamic period and evolved over time through various theological and philosophical developments. This article will provide an overview of the history, sub-groups, geographic distribution, demographics, genetics, and notable figures of Lebanese Shia Muslims.\n\n**History**\n\n### Origins\n\nThe Shia branch of Islam emerged in the 7th century, following a dispute over the succession of the Prophet Muhammad. The Shia believed that the Prophet's cousin and son-in-law, Ali ibn Abi Talib, was the rightful successor, while the majority of Muslims accepted the authority of Abu Bakr, a companion of the Prophet. This disagreement led to a schism within the Islamic community, with the Shia eventually developing their own distinct theology, rituals, and practices.\n\n### Early Islamic period\n\nDuring the early Islamic period, Shia Muslims faced significant persecution and repression from the Sunni-dominated Umayyad and Abbasid caliphates. Many Shia Muslims were forced to practice their faith in secret, and their communities were often targeted for conversion or elimination. Despite these challenges, Shia Muslims maintained their distinct identity and continued to develop their theology and practices.\n\n### Mamluk period\n\nThe Mamluk period, which spanned from the 13th to the 16th century, saw the rise of Shia power in the Middle East. The Mamluk Sultanate, which was founded by Shia Muslims, ruled over Egypt and Syria, and Shia Muslims played a significant role in the administration and military of the Sultanate. During this period, Shia Muslims also made significant contributions to Islamic theology, philosophy, and literature.\n\n### Under Ottoman rule\n\nWhen the Ottoman Empire conquered Egypt and Syria in the 16th century, Shia Muslims faced significant repression and persecution. The Ottomans, who were Sunni Muslims, viewed Shia Muslims as heretics and often targeted them for conversion or elimination. Shia Muslims were forced to practice their faith in secret, and many were forced to flee to other regions to escape persecution.\n\n### Relations with Safavid Iran\n\nDuring the Safavid dynasty, which ruled over Iran from the 16th to the 18th century, Shia Islam became the official state religion. The Safavids, who were Shia Muslims themselves, actively promoted Shia Islam throughout their empire, and Shia Muslims played a significant role in the administration and military of the empire. The Safavid-Sunni conflict, which lasted for centuries, had a significant impact on the development of Shia Islam in the region.\n\n### French mandate period\n\nDuring the French mandate period, which lasted from 1920 to 1946, Lebanon experienced significant social, economic, and cultural changes. Shia Muslims played a significant role in the country's development, and many Shia Muslims became involved in politics, education, and other fields.\n\n### Education\n\nEducation played a crucial role in the development of Shia Muslims in Lebanon. Many Shia Muslims were educated in traditional Islamic schools, while others attended modern schools and universities. Shia Muslims also made significant contributions to education, establishing many schools and universities throughout the country.\n\n### Ja'fari shar'ia courts\n\nJa'fari shar'ia courts, which are Shia courts that operate according to Shia Islamic law, were established in Lebanon during the French mandate period. These courts play an important role in the administration of justice for Shia Muslims in Lebanon.\n\n**Sub-groups**\n\n### Shia Twelvers (Metouali)\n\nShia Twelvers, also known as Metouali, are a sub-group of Shia Muslims who believe in the authority of the 12 imams. This sub-group is the largest and most widespread Shia sub-group in Lebanon.\n\n### Alawites\n\nAlawites are a sub-group of Shia Muslims who are primarily found in Syria and Lebanon. They believe in a unique blend of Shia and Christian theology and have a distinct set of rituals and practices.\n\n### Isma'ilis\n\nIsma'ilis are a sub-group of Shia Muslims who believe in the authority of Isma'il ibn Ja'far, a cousin of the 12th imam. This sub-group is relatively small in Lebanon but has a significant presence in other parts of the Middle East.\n\n**Geographic distribution within Lebanon**\n\nShia Muslims are found throughout Lebanon, with the largest concentration in the southern regions, particularly in the governorates of Nabatieh and South Lebanon. Shia Muslims also have a significant presence in the capital city, Beirut, and in other cities throughout the country.\n\n**Demographics**\n\nAccording to the 2018 National Census, Shia Muslims comprise approximately 28% of the Lebanese population. The Shia population is expected to continue growing, with estimates suggesting that it could reach up to 30% of the population by 2030.\n\n**Genetics**\n\nStudies have shown that Lebanese Shia Muslims share a common genetic heritage with other Lebanese populations, although they have a unique genetic makeup that reflects their history and geography. Shia Muslims in Lebanon have a high level of genetic diversity, with ancestry from various regions, including the Middle East, North Africa, and Europe.\n\n**Notable Lebanese Shia Muslims**\n\n### Religious figures\n\n* Imam Musa al-Sadr, a prominent Shia cleric who was kidnapped in Libya in 1978 and is still missing.\n* Imam Muhammad Hussein Fadlallah, a prominent Shia cleric who was assassinated in 2010.\n* Sheikh Abdul Amir Qabalan, a prominent Shia cleric who is currently the secretary-general of the Supreme Islamic Shia Council of Lebanon.\n\n### Political figures\n\n* Nabih Berri, a Shia politician who has been the speaker of the Lebanese Parliament since 1992.\n* Hussein al-Musawi, a Shia politician who has served as the minister of the interior and the minister of defense.\n* Muhammad Qabalan, a Shia politician who has served as the minister of state and the minister of planning.\n\n### Academics\n\n* Fadi Hassan, a Shia academic who is a professor of Islamic studies at the American University of Beirut.\n* Ali Chehade, a Shia academic who is a professor of history at the Lebanese University.\n* Hassan Mala, a Shia academic who is a professor of Islamic studies at the University of Balamand.\n\n### Artists, singers and journalists\n\n* Anghami, a Shia singer who is known for his traditional and modern Arabic music.\n* Ali Al-Hajj, a Shia singer who is known for his traditional and modern Arabic music.\n* Ali Kanaan, a Shia journalist who is the editor-in-chief of the Al-Akhbar newspaper.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Shia Islam\n* Lebanese people\n* Lebanese culture\n\n**References**\n\n* (Note: This article does not include any citations or references, as per the requirements.)", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.
