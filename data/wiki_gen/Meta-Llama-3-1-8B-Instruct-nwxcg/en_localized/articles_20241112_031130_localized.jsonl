It is a symbol of India's ambitions to develop a world-class rail network and to provide efficient and comfortable transportation to its citizens. The trainset has been in operation since 2019 and has gained significant attention globally for its cutting-edge technology and sleek design.\n\n**#History**\n\nThe Vande Bharat Express has a rich history that spans over five decades. Here is a brief overview of its development:\n\n##**Efforts to increase speed (1960–2016)**\n\nIn the 1960s, the Indian Railways began to focus on increasing the speed of its trains. The first high-speed train in India, the New Delhi–Chandigarh Shatabdi Express, was introduced in 1988. However, it was not until the 1990s that the Indian Railways started to develop its own high-speed train technology. In 1995, the Indian Railways launched the Rajdhani Express, which was designed to reach speeds of up to 110 km/h.\n\nIn the following years, the Indian Railways continued to work on improving the speed of its trains. In 2006, the Indian Railways launched the Gatimaan Express, which was designed to reach speeds of up to 160 km/h. However, the Gatimaan Express was not a native trainset, and it was instead a modified version of the LHB (Linke-Hofmann-Busch) coaches used in European trains.\n\n##**Making an indigenous trainset (2016–19)**\n\nIn 2016, the Indian Railways decided to develop a high-speed trainset that was entirely indigenous. The project, codenamed \"Train 18,\" was launched with the aim of creating a world-class trainset that could compete with the best trains globally. The Indian Railways partnered with the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras and the Research Designs and Standards Organisation (RDSO) to develop the trainset.\n\nThe Vande Bharat Express, as it came to be known, was designed to be faster, cleaner, and more efficient than any other train in India. The trainset was equipped with advanced features such as automatic doors, GPS tracking, and a sophisticated braking system. The trainset was also designed to be more comfortable, with features such as air conditioning, adjustable seats, and ample legroom.\n\n##**Introduction and further (2019–present)**\n\nThe Vande Bharat Express was officially launched on February 15, 2019, with five trainsets being introduced initially. The trainsets were put into service on the New Delhi–Varanasi route, with a journey time of just 8 hours and 30 minutes. The response to the Vande Bharat Express was overwhelming, with passengers praising its comfort, speed, and efficiency.\n\nSince its introduction, the Vande Bharat Express has undergone several upgrades and improvements. In 2020, the Indian Railways announced that it would be introducing a new version of the trainset, which would be capable of reaching speeds of up to 180 km/h. The new trainset, which is expected to be launched in the near future, will feature even more advanced technology and features, such as automatic train operation and advanced safety systems.\n\n**#Rolling stock**\n\nThe Vande Bharat Express is powered by a 3-phase induction motor, which provides a maximum power output of 4,000 horsepower. The trainset is equipped with a regenerative braking system, which helps to recover kinetic energy and reduce energy consumption.\n\nThe Vande Bharat Express has a maximum speed of 180 km/h, although it is designed to operate at speeds of up to 160 km/h on most routes. The trainset has a total of 16 coaches, including 8 executive class coaches, 4 sleeper coaches, and 4 luggage coaches.\n\n**#Facilities**\n\nThe Vande Bharat Express is equipped with a range of advanced facilities, including:\n\n* Automatic doors and air conditioning\n* GPS tracking and location-based information systems\n* Advanced braking system and regenerative braking\n* Comfortable seating and ample legroom\n* Advanced safety features, including collision detection and fire suppression systems\n* Real-time information systems, including displays and public address systems\n\n**#Services**\n\nThe Vande Bharat Express offers a range of services to passengers, including:\n\n* Food and beverage services, including a pantry car and on-board catering\n* Wi-Fi and mobile charging facilities\n* On-board entertainment, including movies and music\n* Attendant services, including assistance with luggage and wheelchair access\n* Priority seating and luggage storage for passengers with special needs\n\n**#See also**\n\n* List of high-speed trains\n* List of Indian Railways trains\n* Indian Railways\n\n**#Notes**\n\n* The Vande Bharat Express is a trademark of the Indian Railways.\n* The trainset is designed and manufactured by the Indian Railways and its partner companies.\n\n**#References**\n\nThis article does not include any citations or references.\n\n**#External links**\n\n* Official website of the Indian Railways\n* Official website of the Vande Bharat Express", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The situation was marked by a buildup of Russian military forces near the Ukrainian border, continued violence and escalation in eastern Ukraine, and allegations of Russian subversion attempts.\n\nBackground\n\nThe conflict in eastern Ukraine between Ukrainian government forces and Russian-backed separatists had been ongoing since 2014. The region had seen repeated outbreaks of violence, with periodic escalations and de-escalations. However, in 2021 and early 2022, tensions began to rise again, culminating in a large-scale invasion of Ukraine by Russian forces in February 2022.\n\nInitial tensions (March–April 2021)\n\nThe initial tensions began in March 2021, when Russian forces began a significant buildup along the Ukrainian border. This buildup was first reported by Ukrainian and Western media outlets, and was seen as a potential threat to Ukraine's sovereignty.\n\n### First Russian military buildup\n\nThe first Russian military buildup began in March 2021, when Russian forces began deploying troops and equipment to the border region. The buildup was reportedly led by the Russian military's Southern Military District, and involved the deployment of large numbers of troops, tanks, and artillery.\n\n### Continued violence and escalation\n\nDespite the buildup, fighting continued in eastern Ukraine, with periodic clashes between Ukrainian government forces and Russian-backed separatists. The violence escalated in April 2021, with a series of attacks on Ukrainian positions by Russian-backed separatist forces.\n\n### Partial withdrawal\n\nIn response to international pressure, Russia began a partial withdrawal of its forces from the border region in April 2021. However, the withdrawal was seen as incomplete, and many observers believed that Russia had left behind significant numbers of troops and equipment.\n\nRenewed tensions (October 2021–February 2022)\n\nTensions rose again in October 2021, when Russia began a second significant buildup along the Ukrainian border. This buildup was seen as a potential precursor to a large-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\n### Second Russian military buildup\n\nThe second Russian military buildup began in October 2021, when Russian forces began deploying troops and equipment to the border region. The buildup was reportedly led by the Russian military's Southern Military District, and involved the deployment of large numbers of troops, tanks, and artillery.\n\n#### November 2021–December 2021\n\nThe buildup continued in November and December 2021, with reports of Russian forces deploying to the border region and engaging in exercises and training activities. The buildup was seen as a significant threat to Ukraine's sovereignty, and was the subject of intense diplomatic pressure from Western countries.\n\n#### January 2022\n\nIn January 2022, tensions rose further, with reports of Russian forces moving into position for a potential invasion of Ukraine. The situation was seen as highly volatile, with many observers predicting a significant escalation of violence in the coming weeks.\n\n#### February 2022\n\nIn February 2022, the situation reached a boiling point, with reports of Russian forces launching a large-scale invasion of Ukraine. The invasion was widely condemned by the international community, and led to a significant escalation of tensions between Russia and Western countries.\n\nAlleged Russian subversion attempts\n\nDuring the period leading up to the invasion, there were reports of Russian attempts to subvert the Ukrainian government and military. These attempts were seen as a significant threat to Ukraine's sovereignty, and were the subject of intense diplomatic pressure from Western countries.\n\n### 2022 Ukrainian cou", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The budget, which was presented by Chancellor of the Exchequer Kwasi Kwarteng, aimed to boost economic growth through a series of tax cuts and other measures.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe UK economy was facing significant challenges in the lead-up to the mini-budget, including high inflation, a cost-of-living crisis, and a looming recession. The government had been under pressure to take action to address these issues, and the mini-budget was seen as a key opportunity to do so.\n\n**The budget**\n\nThe mini-budget included a number of key measures, including:\n\n### **Key points**\n\n* A 50% cut in the basic rate of income tax, from 20% to 19%, effective from April 2023\n* A 19% cut in the top rate of income tax, from 45% to 40%\n* A cut in the rate of corporation tax, from 25% to 20%\n* A cut in stamp duty on property purchases\n* A freeze on fuel duty\n* A cut in the basic rate of national insurance contributions\n\n**Reaction**\n\nThe mini-budget was met with a mixed reaction from across the UK.\n\n### **Currency, interest rate, and debt**\n\nThe pound sterling fell in value against other major currencies in the aftermath of the mini-budget, reaching a 37-year low against the US dollar. The Bank of England was forced to intervene to stabilize the markets, and interest rates were increased to 2.5% in October 2022 to combat inflation.\n\nThe UK's national debt, which had been increasing rapidly in recent years, was also a major concern. The mini-budget added to the debt burden, and the government was forced to reforecast the debt-to-GDP ratio, which was estimated to increase to 97.5% by 2025-26.\n\n### **Bond markets**\n\nThe mini-budget was also criticized by bond investors, who saw the tax cuts and other measures as overly generous and likely to add to the UK's debt burden. The yield on UK government bonds, also known as gilts, rose sharply in the aftermath of the mini-budget, making it more expensive for the government to borrow money.\n\n### **International response**\n\nThe international community was also critical of the mini-budget, with many countries expressing concerns about the UK's fiscal policies and the potential impact on the global economy.\n\nThe European Union, which had already expressed concerns about the UK's economic policies, warned that the mini-budget could harm the UK's economic relationships with the rest of the EU.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF), which had been working with the UK government to address its economic challenges, also expressed concerns about the mini-budget, saying that it could exacerbate the UK's fiscal problems.\n\n### **Business and economic**\n\nThe mini-budget was widely criticized by business leaders and economic experts, who saw it as a recipe for disaster.\n\nThe Confederation of British Industry (CBI), which represents the UK's business community, said that the mini-budget was \"reckless\" and would \"exacerbate\" the UK's economic problems.\n\nThe Trades Union Congress (TUC), which represents the UK's trade union movement, said that the mini-budget was a \"betrayal\" of working people and would \"worsen\" the cost-of-living crisis.\n\n### **Media**\n\nThe mini-budget was widely covered in the media, with many outlets criticizing the government's economic policies.\n\nThe Financial Times, which had been critical of the government's economic policies in the lead-up to the mini-budget, said that the announcement was \"a recipe for disaster\".\n\nThe Guardian, which had also been critical of the government's economic policies, said that the mini-budget was \"a reckless gamble\" that would \"harm\" the UK's economy.\n\n### **Political**\n\nThe mini-budget was also widely criticized by opposition politicians, who saw it as a major policy blunder.\n\nThe Labour Party, which had been critical of the government's economic policies in the lead-up to the mini-budget, said that the announcement was \"a disaster\" and would \"exacerbate\" the UK's economic problems.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats, which had also been critical of the government's economic policies, said that the mini-budget was \"a reckless gamble\" that would \"harm\" the UK's economy.\n\n### **Opinion polling**\n\nOpinion polling suggested that the public was also critical of the mini-budget.\n\nA YouGov poll conducted in the aftermath of the mini-budget found that 62% of respondents believed that the government's economic policies were \"reckless\" and would \"harm\" the UK's economy.\n\nA separate poll conducted by the same firm found that 55% of respondents believed that the government's tax cuts were \"unfair\" and would \"benefit\" the wealthy rather than the poor.\n\n**Government response**\n\nThe government's response to the mini-budget was swift and decisive.\n\n### **Initial responses**\n\nThe government initially defended the mini-budget, saying that it was necessary to boost economic growth and create jobs.\n\nChancellor Kwasi Kwarteng said that the mini-budget was \"a necessary step\" to address the UK's economic challenges and that it would \"benefit\" the economy in the long term.\n\nPrime Minister Liz Truss said that the mini-budget was \"a bold and necessary\" step to address the UK's economic problems and that it would \"create a brighter future\" for the country.\n\n### **Dismissal of Chancellor**\n\nHowever, the government's response was short-lived, and the Chancellor was dismissed just 38 days after the mini-budget.\n\nKwasi Kwarteng was replaced by Jeremy Hunt, who said that the mini-budget had been \"a mistake\" and that the government needed to take a more cautious approach to economic policy.\n\n### **Reversal of tax cuts**\n\nThe government also reversed several of the tax cuts announced in the mini-budget, including the cut in corporation tax and the cut in stamp duty.\n\nThe government said that it had taken the decision to reverse the tax cuts in order to address the UK's fiscal problems and to ensure that the government's finances remained on a stable footing.\n\n**Resignation of Truss as Prime Minister**\n\nThe resignation of the Chancellor and the reversal of the tax cuts were seen as major policy U-turns, and the government's credibility was severely damaged.\n\nLiz Truss resigned as Prime Minister just 49 days after the mini-budget, citing a lack of confidence in her leadership.\n\nTruss was replaced by Rishi Sunak, who said that he would take a more cautious approach to economic policy and that the government would prioritize stability and fiscal responsibility.\n\n**Subsequent events**\n\nThe aftermath of the mini-budget was marked by significant economic and political upheaval.\n\n### **Following Truss's resignation**\n\nThe UK's economy continued to face significant challenges, including high inflation and a cost-of-living crisis.\n\nThe government was forced to implement a series of austerity measures in order to address the UK's fiscal problems and to ensure that the government's finances remained on a stable footing.\n\n### **Later events**\n\nThe UK's economic challenges continued to be a major concern, and the government was forced to implement a series of measures in order to address the UK's fiscal problems and to ensure that the government's finances remained on a stable footing.\n\nThe government also faced significant criticism for its handling of the economy and for the impact of the mini-budget on the UK's economic relationships with the rest of the world.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Economic history of the

The championship was played between the challenger, Ding Liren, and the incumbent champion, Magnus Carlsen, who had refused to defend his title.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe World Chess Championship is a prestigious tournament that takes place every two years, featuring the world's top chess players. The championship is organized by the World Chess Federation (FIDE) and is considered one of the most important events in the chess calendar. In 2022, Magnus Carlsen announced that he would not defend his title, citing a lack of motivation and a desire to focus on other aspects of his life.\n\n**History of Non-Participation**\n\nThis was not the first time that a World Chess Champion had refused to defend their title. In 1975, Bobby Fischer declined to defend his title against Anatoly Karpov, citing a desire to focus on his career and personal life. Fischer's decision was seen as a shock to the chess world, and it led to a long and acrimonious dispute over the championship.\n\nSimilarly, in 2000, Vladimir Kramnik declined to defend his title against Viswanathan Anand, citing a desire to focus on his career and personal life. Kramnik's decision was seen as a strategic move, as he was seeking to regain his mental and physical strength after a long and grueling championship cycle.\n\n**Candidates Tournament 2022**\n\nIn 2022, FIDE organized a Candidates Tournament to determine the challenger for the World Chess Championship. The tournament was held in Madrid, Spain, and featured eight of the world's top chess players. The tournament was a double-round robin, with each player competing against every other player twice.\n\n**Results**\n\nThe Candidates Tournament was a closely contested event, with several players vying for the top spot. In the end, Ding Liren emerged as the winner, defeating his nearest rival, Ian Nepomniachtchi, by a single point.\n\n| Rank | Player | Games | Points |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Ding Liren | 14 | 9.5 |\n| 2 | Ian Nepomniachtchi | 14 | 8.5 |\n| 3 | Levon Aronian | 14 | 8 |\n| 4 | Sergey Karjakin | 14 | 7.5 |\n| 5 | Richard Rapport | 14 | 7 |\n| 6 | Wang Yue | 14 | 6.5 |\n| 7 | Maxime Vachier-Lagrave | 14 | 6 |\n| 8 | Fabiano Caruana | 14 | 5.5 |\n\n**Championship Match**\n\nThe championship match between Ding Liren and Ian Nepomniachtchi was held in Elora, India, in 2023. The match was a best-of-14-games contest, with the winner being the first player to win seven games.\n\n**Organization**\n\nThe championship match was organized by FIDE and the Indian Chess Federation. The match was played at the Elora Sports Complex, a state-of-the-art facility with excellent playing conditions.\n\n**Match Regulations**\n\nThe match regulations were as follows: each game was played with a time control of 100 minutes for the first 40 moves, followed by 50 minutes for the next 20 moves, and then 15 minutes for the remainder of the game, with a 30-second increment for each move starting from move 1.\n\n**Previous Head-to-Head Record**\n\nDing Liren and Ian Nepomniachtchi had a previous head-to-head record of 2-2-1, with Ding winning their two classical games, Nepomniachtchi winning their one classical game, and their one rapid game ending in a draw.\n\n**Seconds**\n\nDing Liren was assisted by his second, Hou Yifan, a Chinese chess grandmaster and former women's world chess champion. Nepomniachtchi was assisted by his second, Sergey Karjakin, a Russian chess grandmaster and former world chess champion.\n\n**Schedule**\n\nThe championship match was scheduled to take place over 14 days, with each player competing in one game per day.\n\n**Leak of Ding Liren's Preparation**\n\nIn the lead-up to the championship match, there were reports of a leak of Ding Liren's preparation, with some of his opening lines and middlegame strategies being revealed on social media. While the exact source of the leak was unclear, it was believed to have been a result of a security breach at one of the chess websites.\n\n**Results**\n\nThe championship match was a closely contested event, with both players competing fiercely. In the end, Ding Liren emerged as the winner, defeating Ian Nepomniachtchi by a score of 7.5-4.5.\n\n**Classical Games**\n\nThe classical games were as follows:\n\n* Game 1: Nepomniachtchi–Ding, ½–½\n* Game 2: Ding–Nepomniachtchi, 0–1\n* Game 3: Nepomniachtchi–Ding, ½–½\n* Game 4: Ding–Nepomniachtchi, 1–0\n* Game 5: Nepomniachtchi–Ding, 1–0\n* Game 6: Ding–Nepomniachtchi, 1–0\n* Game 7: Nepomniachtchi–Ding, 1–0\n* Game 8: Ding–Nepomniachtchi, ½–½\n* Game 9: Nepomniachtchi–Ding, ½–½\n* Game 10: Ding–Nepomniachtchi, ½–½\n* Game 11: Nepomniachtchi–Ding, ½–½\n* Game 12: Ding–Nepomniachtchi, 1–0\n* Game 13: Nepomniachtchi–Ding, ½–½\n* Game 14: Ding–Nepomniachtchi, ½–½\n\n**Tie-Break Games**\n\nThe tie-break games were as follows:\n\n* Game 15: Ding–Nepomniachtchi, ½–½\n* Game 16: Nepomniachtchi–Ding, ½–½\n* Game 17: Ding–Nepomniachtchi, ½–½\n* Game 18: Nepomniachtchi–Ding, 0–1\n\n**Reactions**\n\nThe reaction to the championship match was mixed, with some fans expressing disappointment at the outcome, while others were thrilled to see Ding Liren emerge as the winner. Ian Nepomniachtchi was gracious in defeat, congratulating Ding Liren on his victory and expressing his own satisfaction with his performance.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe aftermath of the championship match saw Ding Liren being hailed as the new world chess champion, with many fans and experts expressing admiration for his skills and strategic thinking. Ian Nepomniachtchi, on the other hand, vowed to continue working on his game, with a view to regaining his position as one of the world's top chess players.\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The World Chess Championship 2023 was a closely contested event, with both players competing fiercely throughout the match.\n* The championship match was played with a best-of-14-games format, with the winner being the first player to win seven games.\n* Ding Liren was assisted by his second, Hou Yifan, a Chinese chess grandmaster and former women's world chess champion.\n* Ian Nepomniachtchi was assisted by his second, Sergey Karjakin, a Russian chess grandmaster and former world chess champion.\n* The championship match was held at the Elora Sports Complex, a state-of-the-art facility with excellent playing conditions.\n\n**References**\n\n* FIDE (2023).

The transformation of the Roman Empire from a pagan to a Christian state had significant implications for the social, cultural, and political fabric of the empire. This article provides an overview of the historiography of the Christianization of the Roman Empire, exploring the various theories and approaches that have been used to understand this complex phenomenon.\n\n**History**\n\n#### Of Historiography\n\nHistorians have long been fascinated by the Christianization of the Roman Empire, and the debate surrounding this topic has been ongoing for centuries. In the early centuries of Christianity, the process of Christianization was often viewed as a gradual and peaceful one, with the conversion of the Roman Empire being seen as a natural progression of the spread of Christianity. However, as the empire's decline and fall became more pronounced, historians began to view the Christianization of the Roman Empire as a more complex and multifaceted process.\n\nIn the 19th century, the historian Edward Gibbon published his monumental work, \"The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,\" which provided a comprehensive and influential account of the Christianization of the Roman Empire. Gibbon's work emphasized the role of Christianity in the decline and fall of the Roman Empire, arguing that the spread of Christianity had weakened the empire's military and economic strength.\n\n#### Roman Religion\n\nThe Roman religion played a significant role in the Christianization of the Roman Empire. The Roman pantheon of gods and goddesses was vast and complex, with a multitude of deities worshipped throughout the empire. The Roman state cult, which was headed by the Roman Emperor, was also an important aspect of Roman religion.\n\n##### Context and Other Evidence\n\nThe context of Roman religion was shaped by the empire's expanding territories and the increasing complexity of its social and cultural landscape. The Roman pantheon of gods and goddesses was often associated with the natural world, and the Romans believed that their gods and goddesses had the power to influence the natural world.\n\nOther forms of evidence, such as inscriptions, coins, and archaeological finds, provide valuable insights into the Roman religion and its role in the Christianization of the Roman Empire. For example, the discovery of a Roman inscription that mentions the worship of a Christian deity, such as the god of the sea, provides evidence of the early Christian presence in the Roman Empire.\n\n#### Spread of Christianity\n\nThe spread of Christianity throughout the Roman Empire was a gradual and complex process that spanned several centuries. The early Christian community was small and scattered, but it grew rapidly as the Roman Empire expanded and as the message of Christianity spread.\n\n##### Origin\n\nThe origin of Christianity is a subject of ongoing debate and research. The Christian New Testament provides a detailed account of the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, but the historical record of the early Christian community is fragmented and often contradictory.\n\nSome historians argue that Christianity emerged from within the Jewish community, while others argue that it was a separate and distinct movement. The early Christian community was often persecuted by the Roman authorities, but it continued to grow and spread throughout the empire.\n\n##### Reception and Growth in Roman Society\n\nThe early Christian community was often viewed with suspicion and hostility by the Roman authorities, but it also gained a significant following among the Roman population. The message of Christianity, which emphasized the importance of love, compassion, and forgiveness, resonated with many people who felt disillusioned with the Roman state cult.\n\nAs the Christian community grew and spread, it began to attract the attention of the Roman authorities. The Roman Emperor Constantine, who ruled from 306 to 337 CE, played a significant role in the Christianization of the Roman Empire, as he was the first Roman Emperor to convert to Christianity.\n\n##### Under Constantine and his Christian Successors\n\nConstantine's conversion to Christianity was a significant turning point in the history of the Roman Empire. He issued the Edict of Milan in 313 CE, which granted toleration to Christians throughout the empire. The Edict of Milan marked the beginning of a new era in the history of the Roman Empire, as Christianity began to play a more prominent role in the empire's politics and culture.\n\nConstantine's successors, including his son Constantius II and his nephew Julian, also played a significant role in the Christianization of the Roman Empire.

He was a major figure in the history of Western philosophy, and his ideas had a profound impact on the development of Western thought. Plotinus was born in Lycopolis, Egypt, and spent much of his life in Rome, where he founded a philosophical school and taught many prominent students.\n\n**Biography**\n\n### Expedition to Persia and return to Rome\n\nPlotinus traveled extensively throughout the ancient world, including a journey to Persia, where he was exposed to various philosophical and spiritual traditions. His time in Persia had a significant impact on his development as a philosopher, and he later incorporated elements of Persian mysticism into his own thought.\n\n### Later life\n\nPlotinus returned to Rome and founded a philosophical school, which attracted many prominent students, including the Roman Emperor Plotinus's student, Porphyry. The school became a hub of intellectual activity, and Plotinus's teachings had a profound impact on the development of Western philosophy.\n\n**Major ideas**\n\n### The One\n\nFor Plotinus, the fundamental reality is the One, a unified, indivisible, and eternal principle that underlies all existence. The One is the source of all being, and it is the ultimate reality that all things strive to return to. The One is beyond human comprehension, and it can only be experienced through mystical contemplation.\n\n### Emanation by the One\n\nPlotinus believed that the One emanates a series of levels of reality, each of which is a step further away from the One. These levels include the Intellect, the Soul, and the material world. Each level is a reflection of the One, but it is also distinct from it. This process of emanation is seen as a gradual process of differentiation and separation from the One.\n\n### The true human and happiness\n\nFor Plotinus, the true human is one who has achieved a state of spiritual liberation and has returned to the One. This state is characterized by a sense of unity, freedom, and happiness. The true human is not bound by the desires and fears of the material world, but is instead free to pursue spiritual knowledge and contemplation.\n\n### Henosis\n\nHenosis is the process of reunification with the One, which is seen as the ultimate goal of human existence. This process involves the transcendence of the material world and the attainment of a state of spiritual unity and freedom. Henosis is seen as the key to achieving true happiness and fulfillment.\n\n**Relation with contemporary philosophy and religion**\n\n### Plotinus's Relation to Plato\n\nPlotinus was heavily influenced by the teachings of Plato, and his philosophy is often seen as a development of Platonic thought. Plotinus saw Plato as a major figure in the history of philosophy, and he often referred to him in his writings. However, Plotinus also departed from Plato in significant ways, particularly in his emphasis on the importance of mysticism and the role of the One in human existence.\n\n### Plotinus and the Gnostics\n\nPlotinus's teachings had a significant impact on the development of Gnosticism, a philosophical and spiritual movement that emerged in the early Christian era. Gnostics saw Plotinus as a major figure in the history of philosophy, and his teachings on the nature of the One and the process of emanation were particularly influential.\n\n### Against causal astrology\n\nPlotinus was critical of causal astrology, which is the idea that the positions of the stars and planets can determine the course of human events. Plotinus saw astrology as a form of determinism that denies the freedom of human beings, and he argued that the stars and planets are mere reflections of the human soul.\n\n**Film studies**\n\nThere have been several films and documentaries made about Plotinus and his teachings, including a 2013 documentary film that explores his life and philosophy.\n\n**Influence**\n\n### Ancient world\n\nPlotinus's teachings had a significant impact on the development of Western philosophy, particularly in the ancient world. His ideas were influential in the development of Neoplatonism, a philosophical movement that emerged in the late Roman Empire.\n\n### Christianity\n\nPlotinus's teachings had a significant impact on the development of Christianity, particularly in the early Christian era. Many Christian thinkers were influenced by Plotinus's ideas on the nature of the One and the process of emanation.\n\n### Islam\n\nPlotinus's teachings were also influential in the development of Islam, particularly in the works of the Islamic philosopher Al-Kindi. Al-Kindi was influenced by Plotinus's ideas on the nature of the One and the process of emanation.\n\n### Judaism\n\nPlotinus's teachings had a significant impact on the development of Jewish mysticism, particularly in the works of the Jewish mystic Isaac Luria. Luria was influenced by Plotinus's ideas on the nature of the One and the process of emanation.\n\n### Renaissance\n\nPlotinus's teachings were also influential in the Renaissance, particularly in the works of the Italian philosopher Marsilio Ficino. Ficino was influenced by Plotinus's ideas on the nature of the One and the process of emanation.\n\n### Great Britain\n\nPlotinus's teachings were also influential in Great Britain, particularly in the works of the English philosopher Thomas Taylor. Taylor was influenced by Plotinus's ideas on the nature of the One and the process of emanation.\n\n### India\n\nPlotinus's teachings have also been influential in India, particularly in the works of the Indian philosopher Sri Aurobindo. Aurobindo was influenced by Plotinus's ideas on the nature of the One and the process of emanation.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Neoplatonism\n* Gnosticism\n* Plato\n* The One\n* Emanation\n* Henosis\n* Mystic\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is based on the Wikipedia article on Plotinus, which was written by a team of contributors.\n* The article has been edited and rewritten to conform to the Wikipedia style guide.\n\n**References**\n\n* Plotinus.

The conflict began in April 2022 and is an escalation of the ongoing War in Donbas, which started in 2014.\n\n**Background**\n\n### War in Donbas\n\nThe War in Donbas is an ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia-backed separatists in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. The conflict began in 2014, following the annexation of Crimea by Russia. The Donbas region has been a major flashpoint in the conflict, with both sides suffering significant losses.\n\n### Prior operations\n\nPrior to the 2022 conflict, the Donbas region had experienced several periods of intense fighting, including the Siege of Donetsk Airport in 2014 and the Battle of Ilovaisk in 2014. The conflict had also resulted in the formation of two self-declared republics, the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) and the Luhansk People's Republic (LPR), which are recognized by Russia but not by the international community.\n\n**Prelude**\n\n### Russian objectives\n\nThe 2022 conflict was widely seen as a major Russian military operation aimed at capturing the Donbas region and potentially overthrowing the Ukrainian government. Russian President Vladimir Putin had previously stated that the 2022 conflict was necessary to protect Russian-speaking populations in Ukraine. However, many analysts believed that the true objectives of the conflict were more complex and multifaceted, including the desire to create a land bridge to Crimea and to undermine Ukraine's sovereignty.\n\n**Opposing forces and foreign involvement**\n\n### Russian and pro-Russian forces\n\nThe Russian military played a significant role in the 2022 conflict, with estimates suggesting that up to 100,000 Russian troops were deployed to Donbas. In addition to the Russian military, the conflict also involved pro-Russian separatist forces, including the DPR and LPR.\n\n### Ukrainian forces\n\nThe Ukrainian military also played a significant role in the conflict, with estimates suggesting that up to 50,000 Ukrainian troops were deployed to Donbas. Ukrainian forces were led by the country's military command, with support from foreign military advisers and equipment.\n\n### Foreign support for Ukraine\n\nUkraine received significant foreign support during the 2022 conflict, including military aid and economic assistance from the United States, the European Union, and other countries. This support helped to bolster Ukraine's military capabilities and undermine the Russian military's efforts to capture the Donbas region.\n\n**Battle**\n\n### Early operations (April–May 2022)\n\nThe 2022 conflict began in April 2022, with Russian forces launching a series of attacks on Ukrainian positions in the Donbas region. The initial attacks were focused on the city of Popasna, which was captured by Russian forces in early May.\n\n### Popasna\n\nThe city of Popasna was a key target for Russian forces during the early stages of the conflict. The city was captured by Russian forces in early May, following a prolonged siege by Ukrainian forces. The capture of Popasna gave Russian forces control of a strategic highway and access to the city of Lysychansk.\n\n### Donetsk Oblast\n\nIn addition to Popasna, Russian forces also targeted other cities and towns in Donetsk Oblast during the early stages of the conflict. These included the city of Sloviansk, which was captured by Russian forces in May 2022.\n\n### Luhansk Oblast\n\nRussian forces also targeted cities and towns in Luhansk Oblast during the early stages of the conflict. These included the city of Severodonetsk, which was captured by Russian forces in June 2022.\n\n### Izium–Sloviansk front\n\nThe Izium-Sloviansk front was a major battleground during the 2022 conflict, with Russian forces launching a series of attacks on Ukrainian positions in the region. The front was characterized by intense fighting, with both sides suffering significant losses.\n\n### Capture of Lyman and Sviatohirsk\n\nIn June 2022, Russian forces captured the cities of Lyman and Sviatohirsk, which gave them control of a strategic highway and access to the Donbas region.\n\n### Izium–Sloviansk front\n\nThe Izium-Sloviansk front continued to be a major battleground during the 2022 conflict, with Russian forces launching a series of attacks on Ukrainian positions in the region. The front was characterized by intense fighting, with both sides suffering significant losses.\n\n### Popasna–Bakhmut front\n\nThe Popasna-Bakhmut front was another major battleground during the 2022 conflict, with Russian forces launching a series of attacks on Ukrainian positions in the region. The front was characterized by intense fighting, with both sides suffering significant losses.\n\n### Sievierodonetsk front\n\nThe Sievierodonetsk front was a major battleground during the 2022 conflict, with Russian forces launching a series of attacks on Ukrainian positions in the region. The front was characterized by intense fighting, with both sides suffering significant losses.\n\n### Fall of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk\n\nIn July 2022, Russian forces captured the cities of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk, which gave them control of the Donbas region and marked a major turning point in the conflict.\n\n### Russian operational pause (4–16 July 2022)\n\nFollowing the capture of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk, Russian forces paused their operations in the Donbas region, allowing them to regroup and reassess their strategy.\n\n**Renewed assaults in Donetsk Oblast (17 July–6 September 2022)**\n\nIn July 2022, Russian forces launched a series of renewed assaults on Ukrainian positions in Donetsk Oblast, targeting the cities of Bakhmut, Soledar, and Siversk.\n\n### Russian assaults near Bakhmut, Soledar, and Siversk\n\nThe Russian assaults on Bakhmut, Soledar, and Siversk were characterized by intense fighting, with both sides suffering significant losses.\n\n### Russian assaults near Avdiivka, Pisky, and Marinka\n\nRussian forces also launched a series of assaults on Ukrainian positions near the cities of Avdiivka, Pisky, and Marinka, which were characterized by intense fighting and significant losses.\n\n### Russian assaults near Sloviansk, Ukrainian counteroffensive\n\nIn September 2022, Ukrainian forces launched a counteroffensive against Russian positions near the city of Sloviansk, which was characterized by intense fighting and significant losses.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe 2022 conflict in the Donbas region resulted in significant losses for both sides, including the capture of key cities and the suffering of thousands of casualties. The conflict also had significant implications for the international community, including the imposition of economic sanctions on Russia and the provision of military aid to Ukraine.\n\n**Casualties**\n\n### Military casualties\n\nEstimates of military casualties during the 2022 conflict in the Donbas region vary widely, but are believed to be in the tens of thousands.\n\n### Civilian casualties\n\nEstimates of civilian casualties during the 2022 conflict in the Donbas region are also believed to be in the tens of thousands, with many civilians displaced from their homes and forced to seek shelter in other parts of Ukraine or in neighboring countries.\n\n**See also**\n\n* War in Donbas\n* Siege of Donetsk Airport\n* Battle of Ilovaisk\n* Annexation of Crimea\n* Russian–Ukrainian War\n* International reactions to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

Launched on November 24, 2021, the mission has been designed to collide with the asteroid Dimorphos, a small moon of the larger asteroid Didymos, to demonstrate the feasibility of this technique. This article provides an in-depth overview of the mission history, spacecraft, secondary spacecraft, and the kinetic impactor method.\n\n**Mission History**\n\nThe concept of using a kinetic impactor to deflect an asteroid dates back to the 1950s. However, it wasn't until the NASA's Planetary Defense Coordination Office (PDCO) was established in 2016 that the idea gained significant attention. The PDCO recognized the need for a demonstration mission to test the kinetic impactor method and assigned the task to the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHUAPL).\n\n**Description**\n\nThe Double Asteroid Redirection Test mission is a collaborative effort between NASA, JHUAPL, and the Italian Space Agency (ASI). The mission consists of two primary components: the spacecraft and the secondary spacecraft.\n\n**Spacecraft**\n\nThe DART spacecraft is a 610 kg (1,345 lb) spacecraft designed and built by JHUAPL. The spacecraft is equipped with a range of instruments to facilitate the mission objectives.\n\n### Camera\n\nThe DART spacecraft is equipped with a single camera, called DRACO (Didymos Recon-DRACO Asteroid Orbiter), which is a high-resolution camera designed to capture images of the asteroid before, during, and after the impact. The camera is capable of capturing images with a resolution of 1.5 meters per pixel.\n\n### Solar Arrays\n\nThe spacecraft is equipped with two solar arrays, each 2 meters (6.6 feet) in length, which provide the necessary power for the mission. The solar arrays are designed to maintain a stable power output despite the changing solar flux during the mission.\n\n### Antenna\n\nThe DART spacecraft is equipped with a high-gain antenna, which enables communication with Earth. The antenna is designed to maintain a stable connection with Earth throughout the mission.\n\n### Ion Thruster\n\nThe spacecraft is equipped with a xenon-ion thruster, which is used for primary propulsion. The thruster is capable of producing a thrust of 22 millinewtons.\n\n**Secondary Spacecraft**\n\nThe secondary spacecraft is an Italian Space Agency's (ASI) LICIACube (Light Italian Cubesat for Imaging of Asteroids), which is a 6U cubesat. The LICIACube is designed to capture images of the DART spacecraft and the asteroid before, during, and after the impact.\n\n**Effect of the Impact on Dimorphos and Didymos**\n\nThe kinetic impactor method relies on the concept of inertia to deflect an asteroid. When the DART spacecraft collides with Dimorphos, it transfers its momentum to the asteroid, causing it to change its velocity. The effect of the impact on Dimorphos and Didymos will be observed through a series of observations, including the measurement of the asteroid's new orbital period.\n\n**Observations of the Impact**\n\nThe DART spacecraft will observe the impact using its DRACO camera, which will capture images of the asteroid's surface before, during, and after the impact. The LICIACube will also capture images of the impact from a different perspective. The observations will provide valuable insights into the effects of the impact on Dimorphos and Didymos.\n\n**Follow-up Mission**\n\nThe DART mission is expected to be followed by a series of follow-up missions, including the European Space Agency's (ESA) Hera mission. The Hera mission is designed to study the effects of the DART mission on the asteroid and provide further insights into the kinetic impactor method.\n\n**AIDA Mission Architecture**\n\nThe AIDA (Asteroid Impact Deflection Assessment) mission architecture is a collaborative effort between NASA and the ESA. The mission consists of two components: the DART spacecraft and the LICIACube. The DART spacecraft will collide with Dimorphos, while the LICIACube will capture images of the impact.\n\n**Mission Profile**\n\nThe DART mission has been designed to follow a specific mission profile to ensure successful completion.\n\n**Target Asteroid**\n\nThe target asteroid for the DART mission is Dimorphos, a small moon of the asteroid Didymos. Dimorphos is a 160-meter (525 feet) diameter asteroid, while Didymos is a 780-meter (2,560 feet) diameter asteroid.\n\n**Preflight Preparations**\n\nThe DART spacecraft underwent a series of rigorous tests and simulations before launch to ensure its readiness for the mission.\n\n**Launch**\n\nThe DART spacecraft was launched on November 24, 2021, from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California using a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.\n\n**Transit**\n\nThe DART spacecraft will transit to the asteroid over a period of several months, using its primary propulsion system to maintain a stable course.\n\n**Course of the Impact**\n\nThe sequence of operations for the impact will be as follows:\n\n1. The DART spacecraft will enter the asteroid's vicinity and begin to observe the asteroid's surface.\n2. The DART spacecraft will adjust its trajectory to ensure a precise collision with the asteroid.\n3. The collision will occur on September 26, 2022, when the DART spacecraft will impact Dimorphos at a speed of approximately 6 kilometers per second (3.7 miles per second).\n4. The impact will cause Dimorphos to change its orbital period, which will be observed through a series of observations.\n\n**Gallery**\n\n* A diagram of the DART spacecraft\n* An image of the asteroid Dimorphos\n* An image of the LICIACube\n* A diagram of the AIDA mission architecture\n* An image of the DART spacecraft during transit\n* An image of the asteroid Didymos\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Asteroid deflection\n* Planetary defense\n* Spacecraft propulsion\n* Ion thrusters\n* Solar arrays\n* Cameras\n* Antennas\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The DART mission is a collaboration between NASA and the Italian Space Agency (ASI).\n* The mission is designed to test the kinetic impactor method for asteroid deflection.\n* The DART spacecraft will collide with Dimorphos on September 26, 2022.\n* The mission will provide valuable insights into the effects of the impact on Dimorphos and Didymos.\n\n**References**\n\nPlease note that this article does not include any citations or references.\n\n**External Links**\n\n* NASA's Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission website\n* Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory's Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission website\n* Italian Space Agency's (ASI) LICIACube website", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

Ruddy, and written by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola. The film is an adaptation of Puzo's 1969 novel of the same name and stars Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton.\n\nPlot\n--------\n\nThe film tells the story of the Corleone family, an Italian-American Mafia family living in New York City. The story follows the rise of Don Vito Corleone (Brando), the aging patriarch of the family, as he seeks to secure his family's future by marrying off his youngest daughter Connie (Talia Shire) to Carlo Rizzi (Gianni Russo) and making his youngest son Michael (Pacino) his consigliere. However, when Don Vito is nearly assassinated, Michael is forced to take over the family business, leading to a series of violent and tragic events.\n\nCast\n-----\n\n* Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone\n* Al Pacino as Michael Corleone\n* James Caan as Santino \"Sonny\" Corleone\n* Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen\n* Diane Keaton as Kay Adams\n* Talia Shire as Connie Corleone\n* Gianni Russo as Carlo Rizzi\n\nProduction\n-----------\n\n### Development\n\nThe film was originally intended to be a more straightforward adaptation of Puzo's novel, but Coppola and Ruddy had other plans. They wanted to make a film that would explore the complexities of the Mafia lifestyle and the moral implications of the characters' actions. The film's script was rewritten multiple times, with Coppola and Puzo working together to create a story that would be both faithful to the novel and innovative in its approach to the material.\n\n### Casting\n\nThe casting process for the film was long and arduous. Coppola had seen Marlon Brando perform on stage and was impressed by his charisma and presence. He cast Brando as Don Vito Corleone, despite some reservations about the actor's age and health. Al Pacino was cast as Michael Corleone, after a series of auditions and screen tests. The rest of the cast was assembled over the course of several months, with James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Talia Shire joining the film in key roles.\n\n### Filming\n\nPrincipal photography for the film began in October 1971 and lasted for approximately eight months. The film was shot on location in New York City and in the surrounding areas of Long Island and Connecticut. The production team used a combination of hand-held camera work and static shots to create a sense of realism and intimacy. The film's cinematographer, Gordon Willis, used a distinctive lighting style to create a sense of mood and atmosphere.\n\nMusic\n------\n\nThe film's score was composed by Nino Rota, who had previously worked with Coppola on the film \"You Only Live Twice\". The score features a combination of traditional Italian music and jazz, with a focus on the use of percussion and strings. The film's most famous theme, \"The Godfather Waltz\", was written by Rota and has since become one of the most recognizable film themes of all time.\n\nRelease\n--------\n\n### Theatrical\n\nThe film was released in the United States on March 15, 1972, and was a critical and commercial success. The film was nominated for 11 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor for Brando. The film's success helped to establish Coppola as a major film director and paved the way for his future projects, including \"The Conversation\" and \"Apocalypse Now\".\n\n### Home media\n\nThe film was released on VHS in 1982 and on DVD in 1997. The film's 25th anniversary edition, released in 1997, featured a new transfer and a series of special features, including a documentary on the film's making and a collection of deleted scenes. The film's 30th anniversary edition, released in 2002, featured a new transfer and a series of additional special features, including a commentary track by Coppola and a collection of behind-the-scenes photographs.\n\nReception\n----------\n\n### Critical response\n\nThe film received widespread critical acclaim upon its release. The film holds a 97% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with many critics praising the film's direction, acting, and cinematography. The film's score was also widely praised, with many critics noting the use of traditional Italian music and jazz to create a sense of mood and atmosphere.\n\n### Box office\n\nThe film was a commercial success, grossing over $245 million at the box office. The film's success helped to establish the film industry as a major force in American popular culture, paving the way for future films like \"The Exorcist\" and \"Jaws\".\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nExternal links\n---------------", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The film stars Dulquer Salmaan in the lead role alongside Samyuktha Menon, Aishwarya Lekshmi, and Indrajith Sukumaran. The film's story revolves around the life of a young man who becomes an outlaw after his family is brutalized by the police.\n\nPlot\n--------\n\nThe film begins with the introduction of the protagonist, Siddharth (Dulquer Salmaan), a young man who lives with his family in a small village. However, their peaceful life is disrupted when the police, led by the corrupt Inspector Sathyan (Indrajith Sukumaran), brutally attack and kill Siddharth's family members. This traumatic event sets Siddharth on a path of revenge, and he slowly transforms into an outlaw, using the alias \"Kaduva,\" which means \"cactus\" in Malayalam. As Kaduva, he starts taking on corrupt police officers and politicians, earning a reputation as a Robin Hood-like figure.\n\nCast\n-----\n\n* Dulquer Salmaan as Siddharth aka Kaduva\n* Samyuktha Menon as Anitha\n* Aishwarya Lekshmi as Seema\n* Indrajith Sukumaran as Inspector Sathyan\n* Chemban Vinod Jose as Jithin\n* Sreelakshmi as Aparna\n* Anusree Reddy as Lakshmi\n* Madhu as Murali\n\nProduction\n-----------\n\n### Development\n\nThe film was first announced in June 2020, with Dulquer Salmaan set to star and produce the film. The story was written by Shankar Ramakrishnan and the screenplay was done by Shibu Sukumar. The film was initially scheduled to release in January 2022, but it was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n### Casting\n\nThe film's casting process began in July 2020, with Dulquer Salmaan announcing that he would be playing the lead role. The casting process was completed by August 2020, with the rest of the cast being finalized. Samyuktha Menon, Aishwarya Lekshmi, and Indrajith Sukumaran were confirmed to play the female lead and supporting roles, respectively.\n\n### Filming\n\nPrincipal photography for the film began in September 2020 and wrapped up in March 2021. The film was shot mainly in Kerala, with some scenes being shot in Karnataka and Goa. The cinematography was done by Jomon T. John, who used a combination of digital and film cameras to capture the film's visuals.\n\nMusic\n------\n\nThe film's music was composed by D. Imman, who is known for his work in Tamil and Malayalam cinema. The soundtrack features five songs, with lyrics written by B.K. Harinarayanan, Rafeeq Ahammed, and Anwar Ali. The soundtrack was released on August 17, 2022, and received positive reviews from music critics.\n\nRelease\n--------\n\n### Theatrical\n\nThe film was released in theaters on August 26, 2022, coinciding with the Onam festival in Kerala. The film was released in over 300 screens across Kerala and other parts of India. The film received a mixed response from audiences and critics alike, with some praising Dulquer Salmaan's performance and others criticizing the film's slow pace and underdeveloped story.\n\n### Home media\n\nThe film was released on Amazon Prime Video on September 16, 2022, in all territories except India. The film will be released in India on October 31, 2022.\n\n### Controversies\n\nThe film was embroiled in controversy after the release of its trailer in July 2022. The trailer featured a scene where Dulquer Salmaan's character is shown beating up a police officer, which was criticized by some as promoting violence against law enforcement. The film's producer, Dulquer Salmaan, was also criticized for his comments on social media, where he appeared to justify the violence shown in the trailer.\n\nReception\n----------\n\n### Box office\n\nThe film's box office performance was mixed. According to reports, the film grossed ₹50 crore (US$6.6 million) in its opening weekend in Kerala, which was considered a decent start for a Malayalam film. However, the film's box office performance declined in subsequent weeks, with some reports suggesting that the film had grossed around ₹100 crore (US$13.3 million) worldwide.\n\n### Critical response\n\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics. Some praised Dulquer Salmaan's performance and the film's technical aspects, while others criticized the film's slow pace and underdeveloped story.

He was a military leader, statesman, and lawyer who played a significant role in the early history of the United States. Born in the Waxhaws region of the Carolinas, Jackson rose from humble beginnings to become one of the most influential figures of his time.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nAndrew Jackson was born to Andrew and Elizabeth Jackson, a Scottish-Irish family. He was the third of eight children, and his family struggled to make ends meet. In 1774, the Jackson family moved to the Waxhaws region, where Andrew's father died in 1767. Elizabeth Jackson later married a widower, Joseph Erwin, in 1775.\n\nJackson received little formal education, but he was homeschooled by his mother and later attended the local Presbyterian church's school. In 1780, he attended the local grammar school in Waxhaws, but his education was interrupted by the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War.\n\n**Revolutionary War**\n\nIn 1780, Jackson joined the local militia, the South Carolina Loyalists, to fight against the British forces. He served as a courier and later as a messenger for the Continental Army under General Nathanael Greene. Jackson's experiences during the war had a lasting impact on his life, and he remained loyal to the American cause throughout his life.\n\n**Early Career**\n\n### Legal Career and Marriage\n\nAfter the war, Jackson studied law under John Overton, a local lawyer. He was admitted to the bar in 1787 and established a successful law practice in Nashville, Tennessee. In 1787, Jackson married Rachel Donelson Robards, a wealthy widow. The couple had one child, Andrew Jackson Jr., in 1787, but the child died in infancy.\n\n### Early Public Career\n\nJackson's early public career began in 1791, when he was elected as the public prosecutor for the Nashville District. In 1796, he was elected as a U.S. Representative from Tennessee's first district. Jackson served in the House of Representatives from 1796 to 1797.\n\n### Planting Career and Slavery\n\nIn 1804, Jackson purchased a 434-acre plantation in Tennessee, which he named the Hermitage. He became a successful planter, growing crops such as cotton, corn, and wheat. However, Jackson also owned slaves, and his plantation became one of the largest slave-holding operations in the state.\n\n### Duel with Dickinson and Adventure with Burr\n\nIn 1806, Jackson engaged in a duel with Charles Dickinson, a wealthy planter, over a horse racing dispute. Jackson killed Dickinson in the duel, which was a defining moment in his career. Later, in 1807, Jackson joined Aaron Burr's expedition to the West, but he eventually returned to Tennessee, disillusioned with Burr's leadership.\n\n**Military Career**\n\n### War of 1812\n\nIn 1812, Jackson was appointed as the major general of the Tennessee militia. He played a key role in the War of 1812, leading his troops to several victories against the Creek Nation. Jackson's most notable victory was at the Battle of New Orleans, where he defeated the British forces in January 1815.\n\n#### Creek War\n\nIn 1813, Jackson led his troops to several victories against the Creek Nation, including the Battle of Tallushatchee and the Battle of Horseshoe Bend. These victories helped to secure American control over the region.\n\n#### Battle of New Orleans\n\nIn January 1815, Jackson led his troops to victory against the British forces at the Battle of New Orleans. The battle was a decisive victory for the Americans, and it marked the end of the War of 1812.\n\n### First Seminole War\n\nIn 1814, Jackson led his troops to several victories against the Seminole tribe in Florida. However, the war was ultimately inconclusive, and the Seminoles continued to resist American control.\n\n**Presidential Aspirations**\n\n### Election of 1824\n\nIn 1824, Jackson ran for president as a Democratic-Republican candidate. He won several states, including Tennessee, Georgia, and Louisiana, but he ultimately lost the election to John Quincy Adams.\n\n### Election of 1828 and Death of Rachel Jackson\n\nIn 1828, Jackson ran for president again, this time as a Democratic candidate. He won the election, defeating Adams in a landslide. However, his wife Rachel died in December 1828, just before his inauguration.\n\n**Presidency (1829–1837)**\n\n### Inauguration\n\nJackson was inaugurated as the seventh President of the United States on March 4, 1829. His inauguration marked the beginning of a new era in American politics, and he quickly established himself as a strong leader.\n\n### Reforms and Rotation in Office\n\nJackson's presidency was marked by several significant reforms, including the reorganization of the federal government and the elimination of corruption. He also implemented a policy of rotation in office, which aimed to reduce the power of the executive branch.\n\n### Petticoat Affair\n\nIn 1831, Jackson was embroiled in the Petticoat Affair, a scandal involving his wife's niece, Emily Donelson, and the wife of his secretary, John Eaton. The scandal ultimately led to the resignation of Eaton and several other officials.\n\n### Indian Removal Act\n\nIn 1830, Jackson signed the Indian Removal Act, which allowed the federal government to forcibly remove Native American tribes from their lands to make way for white settlers. The act led to the Trail of Tears, a brutal and devastating forced relocation of thousands of Native Americans.\n\n### Nullification Crisis\n\nIn 1832, South Carolina nullified the Tariff of 1828, which had been imposed by the federal government. Jackson responded by issuing a proclamation, stating that the nullification of the tariff was unconstitutional. The crisis was ultimately resolved through a compromise, but it marked a significant moment in the debate over states' rights.\n\n### Bank War and Election of 1832\n\nIn 1832, Jackson vetoed a bill to re-charter the Second Bank of the United States, which led to a confrontation with Congress. The veto was a major blow to the bank, and it marked the beginning of a long-standing feud between Jackson and the bank's supporters.\n\n#### Bank Veto\n\nJackson's veto of the bank re-charter bill was a significant moment in his presidency. He argued that the bank was unconstitutional and that it concentrated too much power in the hands of a few individuals.\n\n#### Election of 1832\n\nIn 1832, Jackson ran for re-election, but he faced a strong challenge from Henry Clay, a leading anti-Jacksonian candidate. Jackson won the election, but the margin was much smaller than in 1828.\n\n#### Removal of Deposits and Censure\n\nIn 1833, Jackson ordered the removal of government deposits from the Second Bank of the United States to state banks. The move was seen as a major blow to the bank, and it led to a censure vote in Congress.\n\n#### Panic of 1837\n\nIn 1837, the economy entered a severe recession, known as the Panic of 1837. The recession was caused by a combination of factors, including the removal of government deposits and the collapse of the banking system.\n\n### Physical Assault and Assassination Attempt\n\nIn 1835, Jackson was attacked by a man named Richard Lawrence, who attempted to shoot him at point-blank range. The gun misfired, and Jackson was able to escape unharmed.\n\n### Slavery\n\nJackson was a slave owner, and he believed in the institution of slavery. However, he also believed that slavery was a necessary evil, and he worked to limit its spread in the United States.\n\n### Foreign Affairs\n\nJackson's foreign policy was marked by several significant events, including the signing of the Adams-Onís Treaty, which established the border between the United States and Spanish Florida.\n\n### Judiciary\n\nJackson's presidency was marked by several significant events in the judiciary, including the appointment of Roger Taney as the Chief Justice of the United States.\n\n### States Admitted to the Union\n\nDuring Jackson's presidency, the following states were admitted to the Union:\n\n* Arkansas (1836)\n* Michigan (1837)\n* Florida (1845)\n\n**Later Life and Death (1837–1845)**\n\nAfter leaving office in 1837, Jackson returned to the Hermitage, where he lived out the remainder of his life. He died on June 8, 1845, at the age of 78.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\n### Family\n\nJackson was married to Rachel Donelson Robards, and they had one child, Andrew Jackson Jr., who died in infancy.\n\n### Temperament\n\nJackson was known for his strong personality and his willingness to take risks. He was also known for his sense of humor and his ability to connect with people from all walks of life.\n\n### Religious Faith\n\nJackson was a devout Christian, and he believed in the importance of prayer and devotion. He attended church regularly and was a strong supporter of the Presbyterian Church.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nJackson's legacy is complex and multifaceted. He is remembered as a strong leader who took a stand against the forces of corruption and oppression. He is also remembered as a slave owner who worked to limit the spread of slavery in the United States. Ultimately, Jackson's legacy is a testament to the power of individual action and the importance of standing up for what one believes in.\n\n**Writings**\n\nJackson's writings include:\n\n* \"The Papers of Andrew Jackson\"\n* \"The Autobiography of Andrew Jackson\"\n* \"The Correspondence of Andrew Jackson\"\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is based on a variety of sources, including historical accounts and primary sources.\n* The article has been written in a neutral and encyclopedic tone, and it is intended to provide a comprehensive overview of Jackson's life and legacy.\n\n**References**\n\n* This article does not include any citations or references.\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n### Biographies\n\n* \"Andrew Jackson: A Life\" by H.W.

The outbreak produced numerous tornadoes across several states, resulting in significant damage and loss of life.\n\n**Meteorological Synopsis**\n\nThe outbreak was influenced by a complex low-pressure system that developed over the southern Great Plains on April 4. This low-pressure system interacted with a strong cold front that was moving eastward from the Rocky Mountains, creating a rich source of atmospheric instability. The combination of warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico and cold air from Canada created a strong temperature gradient, which contributed to the development of severe thunderstorms.\n\n**April 4–5**\n\nOn April 4, a strong low-pressure system moved eastward from the southern Great Plains, bringing heavy rain and thunderstorms to the region. Several tornadoes touched down across Texas and Oklahoma, including a high-end EF1 tornado that damaged several homes in the town of Amarillo, Texas. The tornado outbreak continued into the night, with multiple tornadoes reported across the southern Plains.\n\n## April 6–7\n\nOn April 6, the low-pressure system continued to move eastward, bringing severe thunderstorms and tornadoes to the southeastern United States. A strong upper-level disturbance interacted with the low-pressure system, creating a region of enhanced instability and wind shear. Multiple tornadoes touched down across Alabama, Georgia, and the Florida Panhandle, including a high-end EF3 tornado that destroyed several homes in the town of Opp, Alabama.\n\n**Confirmed Tornadoes**\n\nA total of 37 tornadoes were confirmed across the United States during the outbreak sequence.\n\n### April 4 Event\n\nOn April 4, a total of 5 tornadoes were confirmed across Texas and Oklahoma. The tornadoes ranged in intensity from EF0 to EF2 and caused significant damage to homes and businesses.\n\n### April 5 Event\n\nOn April 5, a total of 7 tornadoes were confirmed across Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas. The tornadoes ranged in intensity from EF0 to EF3 and caused significant damage to homes and businesses.\n\n### April 6 Event\n\nOn April 6, a total of 12 tornadoes were confirmed across Alabama, Georgia, and the Florida Panhandle. The tornadoes ranged in intensity from EF0 to EF3 and caused significant damage to homes and businesses.\n\n### April 7 Event\n\nOn April 7, a total of 13 tornadoes were confirmed across Alabama and Georgia. The tornadoes ranged in intensity from EF0 to EF2 and caused significant damage to homes and businesses.\n\n### Pembroke–Ellabell–Black Creek, Georgia\n\nA high-end EF2 tornado touched down in the Pembroke–Ellabell–Black Creek area of Georgia on April 6. The tornado caused significant damage to homes and businesses, including a destroyed gas station and a damaged convenience store.\n\n**Non-Tornadic Impacts**\n\nIn addition to the tornadoes, the outbreak sequence also produced significant non-tornadic impacts, including:\n\n* Heavy rain: Up to 10 inches of rain fell in some areas, causing flash flooding and isolated tornadoes.\n* Strong winds: Sustained winds of up to 60 mph were reported, causing power outages and property damage.\n* Hail: Large hail stones were reported in some areas, causing damage to vehicles and buildings.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe outbreak sequence resulted in significant damage and loss of life. A total of 7 people were killed and over 100 injured. The economic impact of the outbreak was estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* List of tornado outbreaks in the United States\n* List of tornadoes in the United States\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is a summary of the Tornado Outbreak Sequence of April 4–7, 2022.

Born on February 28, 1955, in Brooklyn, New York, Gottfried rose to prominence in the 1980s as a stand-up comedian and appeared in numerous films, television shows, and video games throughout his career.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nGottfried was born to a Jewish family in Brooklyn, New York, to Nathan and Toby Gottfried. His parents were both immigrants from Hungary, and Gottfried often incorporated elements of his Jewish heritage into his comedy routines. Gottfried's early life was marked by a strong interest in comedy and the performing arts. He began taking piano lessons at the age of eight and developed an interest in theater, attending the prestigious High School of Music and Art in Manhattan.\n\nGottfried's family moved to Queens, New York, when he was 17, and he attended the State University of New York at Buffalo, where he studied psychology and studied to be a dentist. However, he abandoned his dental studies and shifted his focus to comedy. Gottfried began performing stand-up comedy in local clubs and coffeehouses in the late 1970s, often incorporating his sharp wit, clever wordplay, and exaggerated gestures into his routines.\n\n**Career**\n\nGottfried's breakthrough in the entertainment industry came in 1980, when he was invited to perform at the legendary comedy club, the Comedy Store, in Los Angeles. He quickly became a regular performer at the club and was soon discovered by comedian and actor, Richard Lewis, who introduced him to his agent. Gottfried's unique style and energetic stage presence caught the attention of several prominent comedians, including Eddie Murphy and Robin Williams, who often invited him to perform at their comedy clubs.\n\nIn the 1980s, Gottfried transitioned from stand-up comedy to television, appearing in several popular shows, including \"Saturday Night Live,\" \"Night Court,\" and \"The A-Team.\" His distinctive voice and irreverent humor also led to voice-over work, including the animated film, \"Aladdin\" (1992), where he played the memorable role of Iago, the wisecracking parrot.\n\n**Podcast**\n\nIn 2011, Gottfried launched his own podcast, \"Gilbert Gottfried's Amazing Colossal Podcast,\" which quickly gained a loyal following. Each episode featured Gottfried interviewing celebrities, comedians, and other notable figures, often with humorous and insightful results. The podcast was known for its unique format, which blended humor, interviews, and pop culture analysis.\n\n**Artistry and Image**\n\nGottfried was known for his distinctive, high-pitched voice, which became a hallmark of his comedy style. His voice was often described as shrill, nasal, and energetic, and he frequently used it to great effect in his stand-up routines and voice-over work. Gottfried's comedic style was also characterized by his over-the-top gestures, facial expressions, and physical comedy, which often left audiences in stitches.\n\nHowever, Gottfried's irreverent humor and sharp wit often led to controversy. He was criticized for his insensitive jokes and comments, particularly regarding politics, sex, and other sensitive topics. In 2015, Gottfried sparked outrage when he made a series of insensitive comments about the deaths of several people, including actor Robin Williams, who had taken his own life.\n\n**Controversies**\n\nGottfried's career has been marred by controversy, particularly in the wake of his insensitive comments and jokes. In 2015, he sparked outrage when he made a series of insensitive comments about the deaths of several people, including Robin Williams, who had taken his own life. Gottfried's remarks were widely criticized, and he faced backlash from fans, fellow comedians, and mental health advocates.\n\nGottfried has also been criticized for his views on politics and social issues. In 2016, he sparked controversy when he made a series of comments about the Black Lives Matter movement, which were widely seen as insensitive and dismissive. Gottfried's comments were criticized by many, including fellow comedians and activists, who accused him of using his platform to spread hate and intolerance.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nGottfried married his second wife, Daryl Roth, in 2007, and the couple had one daughter, Lily, together. However, the couple divorced in 2017 after 10 years of marriage. Gottfried has been open about his struggles with anxiety and depression, and has spoken publicly about his experiences with mental health. In 2020, he announced that he had been hospitalized for an undisclosed illness, but was recovering well.\n\n**Death**\n\nGilbert Gottfried passed away on April 12, 2022, at the age of 67, after a long illness. His death was announced by his family, who said that he had been in poor health for several years. Gottfried's legacy as a comedian and actor will be remembered for his unique style, irreverent humor, and memorable performances.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nGottfried's impact on the entertainment industry cannot be overstated. His unique style, irreverent humor, and memorable performances have inspired countless comedians, actors, and writers. His legacy extends beyond his own work, as he helped pave the way for future generations of comedians and actors who have followed in his footsteps.\n\n**Filmography**\n\n**Television**\n\n* \"Saturday Night Live\" (1980)\n* \"Night Court\" (1984-1985)\n* \"The A-Team\" (1985)\n* \"Aladdin\" (1992)\n* \"Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" (2018-2020)\n* \"The Simpsons\" (1990-2020)\n\n**Video Games**\n\n* \"Aladdin\" (1992)\n* \"Kingdom Hearts\" (2002)\n* \"Kingdom Hearts II\" (2005)\n* \"Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep\" (2010)\n\n**Web**\n\n* \"Gilbert Gottfried's Amazing Colossal Podcast\" (2011-2022)\n\n**Commercials**\n\n* McDonald's (1985-1986)\n* Burger King (1986-1987)\n* Miller Lite (1987-1988)\n\n**Discography**\n\n**Featured Recordings**\n\n* \"Gilbert Gottfried's Comedy Gold\" (1989)\n* \"Gilbert Gottfried's Crap Your Pants!\" (1990)\n* \"Gilbert Gottfried's Amazing Colossal Comedy Collection\" (1993)\n* \"Gilbert Gottfried's Comedy Gold\" (2003)\n\nReferences:\n\n* Various sources, including interviews, articles, and online profiles.\n\nExternal Links:\n\n* Gilbert Gottfried's official website\n* Gilbert Gottfried's Instagram account\n* Gilbert Gottfried's Twitter account", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.
