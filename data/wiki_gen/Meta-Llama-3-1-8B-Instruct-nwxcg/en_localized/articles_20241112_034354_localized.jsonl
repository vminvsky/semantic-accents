These protests were some of the largest and most widespread in China since the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests.\n\n### Background\n\n#### COVID-19 lockdowns in China\n\nChina, the first country to report a COVID-19 case in November 2019, has implemented some of the most stringent lockdown measures globally. The government has adopted a zero-tolerance policy towards the virus, with lockdowns, mass testing, and travel restrictions becoming a regular feature of life in China.

He believes that the gods have abandoned their people and have become corrupt, and that the only way to bring justice is to eliminate them.\n\nAs Gorr's power grows, Thor and the Guardians of the Galaxy, including Star-Lord, Gamora, Drax, Rocket, and Mantis, team up to stop him. Along the way, they encounter Korg, a Kronan gladiator, who joins their cause.

The group is known for its intense rivalries and dramatic storylines, which have captivated audiences worldwide. The stable's history dates back to 2020, when Roman Reigns, a top WWE Superstar, formed the group with his family members and allies.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Bloodline's roots can be traced back to Roman Reigns' Samoan wrestling heritage. Reigns, whose real name is Joe Anoa'i, is a member of the Anoa'i wrestling family, which has produced several notable professional wrestlers. The family's wrestling legacy has been a significant factor in the formation and success of The Bloodline.\n\n**History**\n\n### **The Usos' feud with The Shield (2013–2014)**\n\nThe Bloodline's origins can be attributed to the feud between The Shield (Roman Reigns, Dean Ambrose, and Seth Rollins) and The Usos (Jimmy and Jey Uso) in 2013. The Usos, who are also part of the Anoa'i family, were aligned with The Shield, but they eventually turned against them, leading to a series of intense matches and confrontations.\n\n### **Occasional team-ups (2015–2020)**\n\nOver the next few years, Roman Reigns and The Usos would occasionally team up to take on other WWE Superstars. These team-ups would often lead to notable victories and helped to establish Roman Reigns as a top contender in the WWE.\n\n### **Roman Reigns' leadership (2020–2024)**\n\nIn 2020, Roman Reigns began to form The Bloodline, recruiting his family members and allies to join the stable. This marked a significant shift in Roman Reigns' character, as he transitioned from a heroic figure to a dominant leader.\n\n#### **Official Formation of The Bloodline (2020–2021)**\n\nThe Bloodline's official formation took place in 2020, with Roman Reigns, The Usos, and Paul Heyman (Roman Reigns' manager) at the helm. The group's early matches and storylines were marked by intense rivalries and dramatic confrontations with other WWE Superstars.\n\n#### **All champions, rivalry with The New Day (2021–2022)**\n\nIn 2021, The Bloodline achieved a major milestone by becoming all-champions, with Roman Reigns holding the Universal Championship, The Usos holding the SmackDown Tag Team Championship, and Paul Heyman holding the SmackDown Tag Team Championship (as a manager). This led to a series of epic matches and rivalries with The New Day, a dominant force in the WWE at the time.\n\n#### **Induction of Sami Zayn and Solo Sikoa (2022–2023)**\n\nIn 2022, Roman Reigns inducted Sami Zayn and Solo Sikoa into The Bloodline, expanding the stable's roster and creating new storylines. Sami Zayn, a longtime competitor of Roman Reigns, was initially met with skepticism by the group's members, but he eventually proved himself to be a valuable ally.\n\n#### **Bloodline Civil War (2023)**\n\nIn 2023, The Bloodline was plagued by internal conflicts and power struggles, leading to a dramatic and intense storyline known as the \"Bloodline Civil War.\" The feud pitted Roman Reigns against The Usos, with Paul Heyman caught in the middle.\n\n#### **Addition of The Rock and feud with Cody Rhodes (2023–2024)**\n\nLater in 2023, Roman Reigns was joined by his cousin, The Rock, who made a surprise return to the WWE. This marked a significant shift in The Bloodline's dynamics, as The Rock brought a new level of intensity and charisma to the group. The Bloodline's rivalry with Cody Rhodes, a rising star in the WWE, became a major focus of their storylines.\n\n#### **Solo Sikoa's leadership (2024–present)**\n\nIn 2024, Solo Sikoa, a member of The Bloodline, took over as the group's leader after Roman Reigns' departure. This marked a new chapter in The Bloodline's history, as they continued to face challenges and rivalries in the WWE.\n\n### **Additions of The Tongans and Jacob Fatu (2024)**\n\nIn 2024, Solo Sikoa expanded The Bloodline's roster by recruiting The Tongans and Jacob Fatu, two up-and-coming WWE Superstars. This move marked a significant shift in The Bloodline's direction, as they looked to the future and new opportunities.\n\n### **Bloodline Civil War II (2024–present)**\n\nThe Bloodline's latest storyline, \"Bloodline Civil War II,\" has seen the group facing off against rival factions and internal conflicts. This ongoing story has captivated audiences and cemented The Bloodline's status as one of the most dominant forces in the WWE.\n\n**Members**\n\n### **Current**\n\n* Roman Reigns\n* The Usos (Jimmy and Jey Uso)\n* Sami Zayn\n* Solo Sikoa\n* The Tongans (Taufa'ahau Tupuola and Toli Tupuola)\n* Jacob Fatu\n\n### **Former**\n\n* Paul Heyman\n* The Rock\n\n**Timeline**\n\n* 2013: The Usos and The Shield engage in a feud, leading to The Usos turning against The Shield.\n* 2015: Roman Reigns and The Usos begin to team up, taking on other WWE Superstars.\n* 2020: Roman Reigns forms The Bloodline, recruiting his family members and allies.\n* 2021: The Bloodline becomes all-champions, with Roman Reigns holding the Universal Championship and The Usos holding the SmackDown Tag Team Championship.\n* 2022: Sami Zayn and Solo Sikoa join The Bloodline, expanding the stable's roster.\n* 2023: The Bloodline is plagued by internal conflicts and power struggles, leading to the \"Bloodline Civil War.\"\n* 2023: The Rock joins The Bloodline, marking a significant shift in the group's dynamics.\n* 2024: Solo Sikoa takes over as the leader of The Bloodline after Roman Reigns' departure.\n* 2024: The Bloodline expands its roster by recruiting The Tongans and Jacob Fatu.\n* 2024: The Bloodline faces new challenges and rivalries, including the \"Bloodline Civil War II.\"\n\n**Sub-groups**\n\n### **Current**\n\n* The Usos\n* Sami Zayn and Solo Sikoa\n\n### **Former**\n\n* The Shield (Roman Reigns, Dean Ambrose, and Seth Rollins)\n* The New Day (Kofi Kingston, Big E, and Xavier Woods)\n\n**Championships and accomplishments**\n\n* WWE Universal Championship (Roman Reigns)\n* SmackDown Tag Team Championship (The Usos)\n* SmackDown Tag Team Championship (Paul Heyman)\n* WWE Championship (The Rock)\n\n**Other media**\n\n* The Bloodline has been featured in various WWE video games, including WWE 2K20 and WWE 2K22.\n* The group's storylines and matches have been streamed and discussed on WWE's social media channels.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Anoa'i wrestling family\n* WWE professional wrestling\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The Bloodline's history and storylines are subject to change and updates.\n* This article is based on publicly available information and may not reflect the most up-to-date information.\n\n**References**\n\nNone\n\n**External links**\n\n* WWE.com - The Bloodline\n* WWE on Twitter - The Bloodline\n* WWE on Facebook - The Bloodline", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The incident has sparked widespread concern and investigation into the safety and design of deep-sea submersibles.\n\n**Background**\n\n### OceanGate\n\nOceanGate, Inc. is a private American company that specializes in deep-sea exploration and submersible technology. The company was founded in 2009 and has since become a leading provider of submersible services for scientific research, exploration, and tourism.\n\n### Titanic\n\nThe RMS Titanic was a British passenger liner that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean on April 14, 1912, after colliding with an iceberg during its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. The ship's wreck was discovered on September 1, 1985, by a French-American expedition led by Dr. Robert Ballard. Since then, numerous expeditions have explored the wreck, and it has become a popular destination for deep-sea submersibles.\n\n**Submersible Titan**\n\nThe Titan submersible was designed and built by OceanGate to provide a safe and comfortable experience for passengers on dives to the Titanic wreck. The submersible was equipped with state-of-the-art life support systems, communication equipment, and navigation technology.\n\n### Dives to wreck of Titanic\n\nThe Titan submersible had conducted several successful dives to the Titanic wreck in the months leading up to the incident. The submersible was operated by a team of experienced pilots and engineers who had undergone rigorous training and preparation for each dive.\n\n### Safety\n\nOceanGate had implemented a comprehensive safety program for the Titan submersible, including regular maintenance and inspections, emergency response planning, and rigorous training for crew members. However, some concerns had been raised about the safety of the submersible, particularly in relation to the potential risks of deep-sea diving.\n\n### Prior concerns\n\nThere had been previous incidents and close calls involving the Titan submersible, including a reported pressure hull breach in 2022. However, these incidents had been investigated and resolved, and the submersible had continued to operate safely.\n\n### Previous incidents\n\nIn 2020, a different submersible vessel, the DeepFlight Super Falcon 3S, experienced a malfunction during a dive to the Titanic wreck, resulting in the loss of one of its occupants. The incident was attributed to a faulty valve, and it highlighted the potential risks of deep-sea submersibles.\n\n**Incident**\n\n### Expedition arrangements\n\nThe Titan submersible was scheduled to depart on June 17, 2023, from St. John's, Newfoundland, for a dive to the Titanic wreck. The expedition was expected to last several days, and it was to be accompanied by a support vessel, the Polar Prince.\n\n### 16–17 June preparations\n\nThe crew of the Titan submersible had undergone a thorough briefing and preparation for the dive, including a review of the submersible's systems and a discussion of emergency procedures.\n\n### 18 June, dive, disappearance, and implosion\n\nOn June 18, 2023, the Titan submersible departed from St. John's, Newfoundland, and began its descent to the Titanic wreck. Contact with the submersible was lost shortly after its dive, and a search and rescue operation was launched.\n\n### 18–22 June, search and rescue efforts\n\nA search and rescue operation was conducted by the U.S. Coast Guard, the Canadian Coast Guard, and other agencies. The operation involved a extensive search of the North Atlantic Ocean, including the use of aircraft, ships, and submersibles.\n\n### 22 June, discovery of debris\n\nOn June 22, 2023, debris from the Titan submersible was discovered at a depth of approximately 12,500 feet (3,800 meters) in the North Atlantic Ocean. The debris was later identified as part of the submersible's pressure hull.\n\n### Fatalities\n\nThe incident resulted in the loss of life of five people on board the Titan submersible: Shahzada Dawood, his son Suleman Dawood, Paul-Henri Nargeolet, Hamish Harding, and Stockton Rush, the CEO of OceanGate.\n\n**Recovery operations**\n\nThe recovery of the Titan submersible and its occupants was a complex and challenging operation.

These films, while still classified as independent, often feature more polished production values, higher budgets, and more prominent marketing campaigns compared to traditional independent cinema. Indiewood films often blur the lines between art-house and commercial cinema, appealing to a broad audience while still maintaining some of the creative freedom associated with independent filmmaking.\n\n### Background\n\nThe rise of Indiewood can be attributed to the changing landscape of the American film industry in the 1980s. With the advent of home video and the proliferation of multiplex cinemas, the financial risks associated with independent filmmaking decreased, allowing more filmmakers to take creative risks. The success of films like John Sayles' \"Return of the Secaucus 7\" (1980) and Hal Ashby's \"Second-Hand Hearts\" (1981) demonstrated that low-budget, non-studio-backed films could find an audience and achieve commercial success.\n\n### Divisions\n\nIndiewood films can be broadly categorized into several sub-genres, reflecting the diverse range of themes, styles, and production values within this label:\n\n* **Auteur films**: Directed by established filmmakers, often with a distinct visual style and thematic preoccupations (e.g., David O. Russell's \"The Fighter\" (2010), Darren Aronofsky's \"Black Swan\" (2010))\n* **Genre films**: Often incorporating elements of science fiction, horror, or action, these films frequently feature high-concept premises and special effects (e.g., \"District 9\" (2009), \"Paranormal Activity\" (2007))\n* **Romantic dramas**: Character-driven, emotionally intense films that focus on complex relationships and character development (e.g., \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" (2004), \"Closer\" (2004))\n\n### Other \"mini-major\" subdivisions/indie distributors\n\nSeveral smaller, specialized film distributors have emerged alongside Indiewood, catering to distinct niches within the independent film market:\n\n* **Miramax**: Known for its involvement with independent films, particularly in the 1990s, Miramax has produced and distributed films like \"Pulp Fiction\" (1994) and \"The English Patient\" (1996)\n* **Lions Gate Films**: This Canadian-based distributor has a strong focus on horror, science fiction, and action films, releasing titles like \"Saw\" (2004) and \"The Hunger Games\" (2012)\n* **Warner Independent Pictures**: Established in 2003, this division of Warner Bros. has concentrated on high-profile, critically acclaimed independent films such as \"Good Night, and Good Luck\" (2005) and \"Babel\" (2006)\n\n### Differences from Hollywood\n\nWhile Indiewood films may share some similarities with Hollywood productions, several key differences set them apart:\n\n* **Budgets**: Indiewood films often have lower budgets, allowing for more creative freedom and flexibility\n* **Marketing**: Unlike Hollywood films, Indiewood productions may rely on word-of-mouth, critical acclaim, or social media buzz to generate interest\n* **Creative control**: Independent filmmakers typically have more control over the final product, allowing for more innovative storytelling and artistic expression\n\n### List of selected Indiewood/Pre-Indiewood filmmakers\n\nThis list highlights notable filmmakers who have made significant contributions to the development of Indiewood and its predecessors:\n\n* **John Cassavetes** (1929-1989): An influential director and actor, known for \"Shadows\" (1959) and \"A Woman Under the Influence\" (1974)\n* **John Sayles** (b. 1950): A critically acclaimed director and screenwriter, responsible for \"Return of the Secaucus 7\" (1980) and \"Matewan\" (1987)\n* **Jim Jarmusch** (b. 1953): A prominent director and screenwriter, known for \"Stranger Than Paradise\" (1984) and \"Mystery Train\" (1989)\n* **Spike

This article provides an overview of the background, doctrine, and methods employed by Russia in its information war against Ukraine, as well as the responses and countermeasures taken by Ukraine and the international community.\n\nBackground\n\n### Doctrine\n\nThe Russian information war against Ukraine is rooted in the country's doctrine of information warfare, which emphasizes the use of information operations to achieve strategic objectives. This doctrine is based on the concept of \"hybrid warfare,\" which combines conventional military action with information operations and other forms of non-kinetic warfare. Russia's approach to information warfare emphasizes the use of disinformation, propaganda, and other forms of psychological warfare to create a favorable narrative and shape public opinion.\n\n### Reasons for the conflict\n\n#### Revanchism\n\nOne of the primary motivations behind Russia's information war against Ukraine is revanchism, or the desire to regain lost territory and influence.

Russia's information war is aimed at undermining Ukraine's independence and sovereignty, and restoring Russian influence over the country.\n\n#### History of the war\n\nThe conflict between Russia and Ukraine has a long history, dating back to the annexation of Crimea in 2014. Since then, Russia has engaged in a range of information operations aimed at influencing public opinion and shaping international perceptions of the conflict.

RT (formerly Russia Today) has been a key player in this effort, with a range of programming aimed at promoting a pro-Russian narrative and shaping public opinion.\n\n#### RT\n\nRT (formerly Russia Today) has been a key player in Russia's information war against Ukraine, with a range of programming aimed at promoting a pro-Russian narrative and shaping public opinion. RT has been accused of promoting disinformation and propaganda, and has been banned in several countries for its role in the information war.\n\n#### Russian interference with Ukrainian media\n\nRussia has also engaged in a range of efforts aimed at interfering with Ukrainian media outlets, including hacking and cyber attacks.

Warfield, and produced by MTV Productions. The show was filmed on location in Los Angeles, California, and featured a mix of original music and licensed songs.

The show's writing was also praised for its complexity and nuance, and its ability to tackle tough themes such as identity, friendship, and social hierarchy.\n\nHowever, the show also faced some criticism for its portrayal of certain characters and its handling of sensitive topics. Some critics felt that the show's portrayal of certain characters, such as Jake Tanner, was overly stereotypical and lacked depth. Others felt that the show's handling of certain topics, such as substance abuse and bullying, was insensitive and exploitative.\n\n## Release\n\n2_Good_2_Be_True premiered on MTV on October 21, 1998, and ran for two seasons until its conclusion on May 5, 1999.

From its roots in ancient mythologies to the modern-day epics, fantasy has traversed a complex and dynamic path, influenced by social, cultural, and literary developments. This article explores the history of fantasy, tracing its development from its earliest forms to the present day.\n\n**Differences between fantasy and earlier fantastic works**\n\nWhile fantasy has often been associated with the fantastical and the unknown, it is distinct from earlier forms of fiction that also explored the supernatural or the extraordinary. For instance, mythology and folklore often presented fantastical creatures and events as part of their cultural heritage, but these works were not necessarily aimed at entertaining or diverting, as modern fantasy often is. Similarly, fairy tales, while fantastical in nature, were often used to convey moral or didactic messages. Fantasy, on the other hand, has traditionally been characterized by its focus on imaginative and thrilling narratives, often set in imaginary worlds or societies.\n\n**Development of fantasy**\n\nOver time, fantasy has evolved through various literary and cultural movements, each contributing to its growth and diversification.\n\n### **Romances**\n\nMedieval romances, which flourished in Europe from the 12th to the 15th centuries, laid some of the groundwork for modern fantasy. These stories often featured magical or supernatural elements, such as enchantments, prophecies, and mythical creatures. Works like Chrétien de Troyes's Arthurian romances and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight showcased a sense of wonder and enchantment that would become hallmarks of the fantasy genre. While not directly influencing modern fantasy, these romances helped establish the notion that fiction could be used to explore the extraordinary and the unknown.\n\n### **The Enlightenment**\n\nDuring the 17th and 18th centuries, the Enlightenment's emphasis on reason and intellectual curiosity led to a shift in literary focus. Works like Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels (1726) and Voltaire's Candide (1759) satirized the fantastical and the absurd, poking fun at the excesses of imagination. This period saw the rise of literary rationalism, which questioned the validity of fantastical elements in fiction. However, the seeds of fantasy were not entirely eradicated; instead, they were transformed into more nuanced and subtle forms, often embedded in allegorical or satirical narratives.\n\n### **Romanticism**\n\nThe Romantic movement of the late 18th and early 19th centuries revived interest in the fantastical and the sublime. Writers like Lord Byron, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and Mary Shelley (author of Frankenstein) explored the darker aspects of human nature and the power of imagination. Their works often featured elements of fantasy, such as supernatural beings, magical landscapes, and the sublime. This emphasis on the imagination and the emotional experience laid the groundwork for the development of modern fantasy.\n\n**Modern fantasy**\n\nThe modern fantasy genre began to take shape in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, influenced by various literary and cultural currents.\n\n### **Pre-Tolkien**\n\nBefore the rise of J.R.R. Tolkien's epic fantasy, modern fantasy was marked by works such as George MacDonald's The Princess and the Goblin (1872) and William Morris's The Well at the World's End (1896). These stories often featured elements of fantasy, such as magical creatures, mythical lands, and the supernatural, but they were often set in recognizable, real-world locations. This period also saw the emergence of science fiction, which often incorporated fantastical elements, such as time travel and alien civilizations.\n\n### **Tolkien**\n\nJ.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit (1937) and The Lord of the Rings (1954-1955) trilogy are widely regarded as the foundation of modern fantasy. Tolkien's work drew on a rich wellspring of mythology, folklore, and fairy tales, creating a fully realized, detailed world with its own history, cultures, and languages.

This concept is prevalent in several sports, each with its unique rules and regulations. In this article, we will delve into the world of free substitution, exploring sports that allow this tactic, their rules, and the implications of such strategies.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nFree substitution is a key aspect of many sports, enabling teams to adapt to changing circumstances, exploit weaknesses, and conserve energy. By allowing teams to make substitutions during live play or during stoppages of play, sports like basketball, soccer, and hockey have created a dynamic and fast-paced environment. In this article, we will examine the sports that permit free substitution, their rules, and the strategic implications of this tactic.\n\n**Sports that Allow Free Substitution during Live Play**\n\nSeveral sports allow unlimited substitution during live play, providing teams with the flexibility to make strategic changes on the fly.\n\n### **Basketball**\n\nIn basketball, teams are allowed to substitute players during live play, including during timeouts. This allows coaches to adjust their lineup, exploit defensive weaknesses, or provide a breather for tired players. Basketball's fast-paced nature and high-scoring games make free substitution a crucial aspect of the sport.\n\n### **Field Hockey**\n\nField hockey, a fast-paced and physically demanding sport, also permits free substitution during live play. Teams can make substitutions without interruption, allowing them to maintain their momentum and exploit weaknesses in the opposing team's defense.\n\n### **Rugby**\n\nIn rugby, teams can make unlimited substitutions during live play, including during scrums and lineouts. This flexibility allows coaches to make strategic changes and provide a much-needed break for exhausted players.\n\n### **Water Polo**\n\nWater polo, a physically demanding sport played in a swimming pool, also allows unlimited substitution during live play. Teams can make substitutions without interruption, enabling them to maintain their pace and exploit weaknesses in the opposing team's defense.\n\n### **Tennis**\n\nTennis, while not a team sport, allows players to make unlimited substitutions between points, known as \"changeovers.\" This enables players to adjust their strategy, change their equipment, or simply take a break between points.\n\n### **Squash**\n\nSquash, a fast-paced racquet sport, also permits free substitution between points, known as \"changeovers.\" This allows players to adjust their strategy, change their equipment, or simply take a break between points.\n\n**Sports that Allow Unlimited Substitutions during Stoppages of Play Only**\n\nSome sports allow unlimited substitutions during stoppages of play, such as timeouts or halftime breaks.\n\n### **Soccer**\n\nIn soccer, teams can make unlimited substitutions during stoppages of play, including halftime breaks and timeouts. However, substitutions cannot be made during live play, except in specific situations such as injuries or yellow/red cards.\n\n### **American Football**\n\nAmerican football allows teams to make unlimited substitutions during stoppages of play, including timeouts and halftime breaks. However, substitutions cannot be made during live play, except in specific situations such as injuries or yellow/red flags.\n\n### **Ice Hockey**\n\nIce hockey, a fast-paced and physically demanding sport, allows teams to make unlimited substitutions during stoppages of play, including timeouts and intermissions. However, substitutions cannot be made during live play, except in specific situations such as injuries or penalties.\n\n### **Cricket**\n\nCricket, a bat-and-ball sport, allows teams to make unlimited substitutions during stoppages of play, including interval breaks and timeouts. However, substitutions cannot be made during live play, except in specific situations such as injuries or dismissals.\n\n**Sports with Limited Substitution**\n\nSome sports have limited substitution rules, restricting the number of substitutions teams can make during a game.\n\n### **Baseball**\n\nIn baseball, teams are limited to three substitutions per game, excluding position players. This restriction is designed to promote strategy and reduce the need for frequent substitutions.\n\n### **Softball**\n\nSoftball, a variant of baseball, also has limited substitution rules. Teams are allowed to make three substitutions per game, excluding position players.\n\n### **Golf**\n\nGolf, an individual sport, has no substitution rules. However, golfers can take a limited number of relief shots during a round, known as \"relief\" or \"drop.\"\n\n### **Bowling**\n\nBowling, a recreational sport, has limited substitution rules. Teams are allowed to make two substitutions per game, excluding position players.\n\n### **Curling**\n\nCurling, a winter sport, has limited substitution rules. Teams are allowed to make one substitution per game, excluding position players.\n\n**Sports with Mixed or Hybrid Systems**\n\nSome sports have mixed or hybrid systems, combining elements of free substitution and limited substitution.\n\n### **Tug of War**\n\nTug of war, a team sport, has a mixed system of substitution. Teams are allowed to make unlimited substitutions during stoppages of play, but limited substitutions during live play.\n\n### **Polo**\n\nPolo, a fast-paced equestrian sport, has a hybrid system of substitution. Teams are allowed to make unlimited substitutions during stoppages of play, but limited substitutions during live play.\n\n**See also**\n\n* **Substitution (sports)**\n* **Tactical substitution**\n* **Strategic substitution**\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article focuses on sports that allow free substitution, but does not cover all sports with substitution rules.\n* The rules and regulations of each sport are subject to change, and this article may not reflect the most up-to-date information.\n* The strategic implications of free substitution in various sports are complex and multifaceted, and this article provides a general overview of the topic.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The union released several surveys and reports highlighting the need for better compensation and working conditions for its members.\n\nIn May 2023, SAG-AFTRA announced that it would be holding a membership vote on a new contract proposal.

He is best known for his leadership of the Army of the Potomac and his ultimate victory over Confederate General Robert E. Lee at the Battle of Gettysburg.\n\n**Early life and education**\n\nGeorge Gordon Meade was born on December 31, 1815, in Cádiz, Spain, to a family of Irish-American merchants. His father, Richard Worsam Meade, was a successful merchant who had made a fortune in trade, and his mother, Margaret Gardner Meade, was a member of a prominent Philadelphia family. Meade was the oldest of five children, and his family moved to Philadelphia when he was six years old.\n\nMeade attended the Academy of the United States Military College in West Point, New York, where he graduated in 1835. He served in the United States Army Corps of Topographical Engineers for several years before transferring to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\n\n**Topographical Corps and Mexican-American War**\n\nMeade's service in the Topographical Corps took him to various parts of the United States, where he played a key role in mapping and surveying the country. In 1846, he joined the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and was assigned to the Mexican-American War. Meade served under General Winfield Scott and participated in several key battles, including the Battle of Cerro Gordo and the Battle of Contreras.\n\n**American Civil War**\n\nMeade's experience in the Mexican-American War prepared him for the American Civil War, which began in 1861. In April 1861, Meade was appointed as the commander of the Department of Pennsylvania, which included Philadelphia and several surrounding counties. He played a key role in organizing the defenses of the city and preparing the state's militia for war.\n\n**Peninsula campaign**\n\nIn March 1862, Meade was appointed as the chief engineer of the Army of the Potomac, which was led by General George McClellan. Meade served in this position throughout the Peninsula campaign, which was a series of battles fought in Virginia. During this campaign, Meade played a key role in planning and executing several key battles, including the Battle of Yorktown and the Battle of Seven Pines.\n\n**Maryland campaign**\n\nIn September 1862, Meade's Army of the Potomac was ordered to move into Maryland to counter the advance of Confederate General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. Meade was appointed as the commander of the Army of the Potomac in September 1862, after the Battle of Antietam. He played a key role in planning and executing the battles of South Mountain and Antietam.\n\n**Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville**\n\nIn November 1862, Meade's Army of the Potomac was ordered to move into Virginia to counter the advance of Confederate General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. Meade's forces were defeated at the Battle of Fredericksburg in December 1862, and in May 1863, they were defeated again at the Battle of Chancellorsville.\n\n**Gettysburg campaign**\n\nIn June 1863, Meade's Army of the Potomac was ordered to move into Pennsylvania to counter the advance of Confederate General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. Meade's forces were defeated at the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863, but he was able to rally his troops and launch a successful counterattack. The battle was a decisive victory for the Union and is considered a turning point in the war.\n\n### Command of the Army of the Potomac\n\nMeade was appointed as the commander of the Army of the Potomac in September 1862, after the Battle of Antietam. He served in this position throughout the war, leading the army through several key battles, including the Battle of Fredericksburg and the Battle of Chancellorsville.\n\n### Battle of Gettysburg\n\nThe Battle of Gettysburg was a decisive victory for the Union and is considered a turning point in the war. The battle was fought in July 1863, and Meade's Army of the Potomac was able to defeat the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia in a series of bloody battles. The battle was marked by heavy casualties on both sides, but ultimately resulted in a Union victory.\n\n### Lee's retreat\n\nAfter the Battle of Gettysburg, Confederate General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia was forced to retreat back to Virginia. Meade's Army of the Potomac pursued the Confederates, but was unable to destroy their army. The retreat marked the end of the Gettysburg campaign and the beginning of a long and bloody siege of the city of Richmond.\n\n**Bristoe and Mine Run campaign**\n\nIn the fall of 1863, Meade's Army of the Potomac was ordered to move into Virginia to counter the advance of Confederate General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. Meade's forces were defeated at the Battle of Bristoe Station in October 1863, and in November 1863, they were defeated again at the Battle of Mine Run.\n\n**Overland campaign**\n\nIn the spring of 1864, Meade's Army of the Potomac was ordered to move into Virginia to counter the advance of Confederate General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. Meade's forces were defeated at the Battle of the Wilderness in May 1864, and in June 1864, they were defeated again at the Battle of Cold Harbor.\n\n**Richmond-Petersburg campaign**\n\nIn the summer of 1864, Meade's Army of the Potomac was ordered to move into Virginia to besiege the city of Petersburg. Meade's forces were able to capture several key Confederate lines, including the Outer Forts and the Second Line of Works. In the fall of 1864, Meade's forces were able to break through the Confederate lines and capture the city of Petersburg.\n\n**Political rivalries**\n\nDuring the American Civil War, Meade was often at odds with his superiors, including General George McClellan and General Ulysses S. Grant. Meade was also critical of the policies of President Abraham Lincoln, whom he saw as too lenient towards the Confederacy.\n\n**Reconstruction**\n\nAfter the American Civil War, Meade was appointed as the commander of the Department of the Susquehanna, which included Pennsylvania and several surrounding counties. He played a key role in overseeing the Reconstruction efforts in the state and was instrumental in rebuilding the state's economy and infrastructure.\n\n**Personal life**\n\nMeade was married to Margaret Lady Lee, a member of a prominent Virginia family. The couple had five children together, including a son who died in infancy. Meade was known to be a quiet and reserved man, who preferred to keep a low profile.\n\n**Later life and death**\n\nMeade retired from the U.S. Army in 1865 and returned to his home in Philadelphia. He died on November 6, 1872, at the age of 57. Meade was buried in Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nMeade's legacy as a military leader is still debated among historians today. Some see him as a cautious and conservative general who was reluctant to take risks, while others see him as a skilled and effective commander who was able to achieve victory in the face of overwhelming odds. Regardless of one's opinion, Meade was a key figure in the American Civil War and played a crucial role in shaping the course of the conflict.\n\n**Memorials to Meade**\n\nMeade's legacy is commemorated in several ways, including the Meade Monument in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, which was dedicated in 1889. The monument is a large granite obelisk that stands over 100 feet tall and features a bronze statue of Meade on horseback.\n\n**In popular culture**\n\nMeade has been portrayed in several films and television shows, including the 1993 film \"Gettysburg\" and the 2011 film \"Gettysburg: Day Three.\" He has also been featured in several books and articles, including the 1994 book \"The Gettysburg Nobody Knows\" by Thomas A. Desjardin.\n\n**Dates of rank**\n\nMeade's dates of rank are as follows:\n\n* Captain, U.S. Army Corps of Topographical Engineers (1835)\n* Major, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (1846)\n* Lieutenant Colonel, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (1848)\n* Colonel, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (1853)\n* Brigadier General, U.S. Army (1861)\n* Major General, U.S. Army (1861)\n* General, U.S. Army (1864)\n\n**See also**\n\n* American Civil War\n* Gettysburg, Pennsylvania\n* Meade Monument\n* Robert E.

The film follows a group of wealthy and complex individuals who are invited to a private island for a murder mystery game, only to find themselves caught up in a real-life murder investigation.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film takes place on a private island in Greece, where a group of wealthy and influential individuals have gathered for a murder mystery game.

He has written extensively on topics such as government corruption, war crimes, and intelligence operations.\n\n#Early life and education\n\nSeymour Hersh was born on April 8, 1937, in Chicago, Illinois, to Jewish parents from Poland. He grew up in a working-class neighborhood and developed an early interest in writing and politics. Hersh attended South Shore High School in Chicago and later enrolled in the University of Chicago, where he studied medieval and modern history.\n\n#Newspaper career\n\nHersh began his career in journalism in 1959 as a copy boy for the Chicago Sun-Times. He later moved to the New York Herald Tribune, where he worked as a reporter and eventually became a national correspondent. In 1966, he joined the New York Post, covering politics and government.\n\n##My Lai massacre\n\nHersh's most notable early work was his reporting on the My Lai massacre, a war crime committed by American soldiers in Vietnam in 1968. His investigation, which was published in The New York Times in 1970, exposed the atrocities committed by the US military and led to widespread outrage and condemnation.\n\n##The New York Times\n\nIn 1972, Hersh joined The New York Times as a senior investigative reporter. During his time at the paper, he wrote extensively on government corruption, intelligence operations, and military affairs. Some of his notable works from this period include his reporting on the CIA's secret bombing of Cambodia and the CIA's assassination plots against foreign leaders.\n\n#Investigative books: 1980s and 1990s\n\nHersh's investigative reporting was often book-length, and he published several notable works during the 1980s and 1990s. Some of his notable books from this period include:\n\n* \"The Price of Power: Kissinger in the White House\" (1983), which examined Henry Kissinger's role in US foreign policy during the Nixon and Ford administrations.\n* \"The Samson Option: Israel's Nuclear Arsenal and American Foreign Policy\" (1991), which explored Israel's nuclear program and its implications for US foreign policy.\n* \"The Dark Side of Camelot\" (1997), which examined the personal and professional life of John F. Kennedy and his presidency.\n\n#Later investigations\n\n##Iraq and Abu Ghraib\n\nIn 2003, Hersh began investigating reports of US mistreatment of prisoners in Iraq. His reporting, which was published in The New Yorker, exposed the abuses at Abu Ghraib prison and led to widespread condemnation of the US military.\n\n##Iran\n\nHersh has written extensively on Iran's nuclear program and its implications for US foreign policy. In 2008, he reported on a secret US plan to destabilize the Iranian government, which was later revealed to be a covert operation.\n\n##Syria and chemical attacks\n\nIn 2011, Hersh reported on a US intelligence operation that had discovered that the Syrian government was responsible for a chemical attack on civilians. His reporting was later disputed by US officials, who claimed that the intelligence was incomplete.\n\n##Killing of Osama bin Laden\n\nHersh has written extensively on the circumstances surrounding the killing of Osama bin Laden in 2011. He has reported on controversy surrounding the raid, including claims that the US military had deliberately destroyed evidence of bin Laden's death.\n\n##Nord Stream pipeline and Ukraine\n\nIn 2020, Hersh reported on a US intelligence operation that had discovered that the US government had secretly supported a Ukrainian operation to sabotage the Nord Stream pipeline, which runs from Russia to Germany.\n\n#Other statements\n\n##Speeches\n\nHersh has given several notable speeches on politics and journalism, including a 2013 speech at the University of Chicago, in which he criticized the US media for its lack of investigative reporting.\n\n##Murder of Seth Rich\n\nIn 2017, Hersh reported on conspiracy theories surrounding the murder of Seth Rich, a Democratic National Committee staffer who was killed in 2016. His reporting was later disputed by US officials, who claimed that the conspiracy theories were unfounded.\n\n##Pat Nixon abuse\n\nIn 2020, Hersh reported on allegations of abuse by Pat Nixon, the wife of President Richard Nixon, which were later disputed by US officials.\n\n#Use of anonymous sources\n\nHersh has been criticized for his use of anonymous sources in his reporting, which some have claimed is a violation of journalistic standards. However, Hersh has argued that the use of anonymous sources is necessary to protect sources who are vulnerable to retaliation or retribution.\n\n#Personal life\n\nHersh is married and has two children. He lives in Washington, D.C.\n\n#Awards and honors\n\nHersh has won numerous awards for his reporting, including the Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting in 1970 for his reporting on the My Lai massacre.\n\n#Publications\n\n##Books\n\n* \"My Lai 4: A Report on the Massacre and Its Aftermath\" (1970)\n* \"The Price of Power: Kissinger in the White House\" (1983)\n* \"The Samson Option: Israel's Nuclear Arsenal and American Foreign Policy\" (1991)\n* \"The Dark Side of Camelot\" (1997)\n* \"Chain of Command: The Road from 9/11 to Abu Ghraib\" (2004)\n* \"The Driver: A Novel\" (2011)\n* \"Reporter: A Memoir\" (2018)\n\n##Articles\n\n* \"The My Lai Massacre\" (1970)\n* \"The CIA's Secret Bombing of Cambodia\" (1973)\n* \"The CIA's Assassination Plots\" (1974)\n* \"The Price of Power: Kissinger in the White House\" (1983)\n* \"The Samson Option: Israel's Nuclear Arsenal and American Foreign Policy\" (1991)\n* \"The Dark Side of Camelot\" (1997)\n* \"The Road from 9/11 to Abu Ghraib\" (2004)\n* \"The Driver: A Novel\" (2011)\n\n#References\n\n##Works cited\n\n* Hersh, S.

He was a prominent figure in the history of France during the 15th century, known for his bravery and military prowess, as well as his subsequent downfall and execution for child murder.\n\n**The House of Retz**\n\nGilles de Rais was born on 1404 in Champtocé, France, to Guy de Rais, Lord of the House of Retz, and Isabelle de Bourbon. He was the fifth of six children, and his family was part of the powerful nobility of France. The House of Retz was a renowned dynasty known for its wealth, military prowess, and influential connections.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nGilles de Rais was raised in the château of Champtocé, where he received a classical education in Latin, Greek, and theology. He was trained in arms and martial arts from a young age and showed exceptional bravery and skill in battle. His father, Guy de Rais, was a seasoned military commander who fought alongside the French king, Charles VII, during the Hundred Years' War.\n\n**Matrimonial Projects**\n\nIn 1420, Gilles de Rais married Catherine de Thouars, a member of the powerful Thouars family. The marriage was a strategic alliance aimed at strengthening the House of Retz's ties with the House of Thouars. However, the union was childless, and the couple eventually separated.\n\n**Family Disputes**\n\nGilles de Rais's family life was marked by disputes and power struggles. His father, Guy de Rais, was known for his authoritarian and demanding nature, which often led to conflicts with his children. Gilles de Rais's brothers, René and Jean, were also involved in power struggles within the family, which would eventually contribute to Gilles's downfall.\n\n**Titles, Estates, and Wealth**\n\nAs a member of the House of Retz, Gilles de Rais inherited a vast fortune, including several castles, estates, and properties. He was granted the title of Marshal of France and became one of the most influential nobles in the country. His wealth and influence placed him in a position of power, which he would later use to pursue his own interests and desires.\n\n**Military Career**\n\nGilles de Rais began his military career during the Hundred Years' War, fighting alongside the French king, Charles VII. He quickly gained recognition for his bravery and military prowess, and was appointed Marshal of France in 1429.\n\n**First Hypothetical Feat of Arms**\n\nIn 1425, Gilles de Rais and a group of soldiers were sent to Brittany to quell a rebellion against the French crown. According to legend, Gilles de Rais single-handedly defeated a group of 200 rebels, killing many and capturing others. This feat was seen as a testament to his bravery and military skill, and it cemented his reputation as a formidable warrior.\n\n**Franco-Breton Alliance through the House of Valois-Anjou**\n\nIn 1427, Gilles de Rais and the House of Valois-Anjou formed an alliance to counter the growing power of the English in France.

The Speaker is chosen by the majority party in the House, and the election is typically held on the first day of the new Congress, which is January 3 of each odd-numbered year.

He is a member of the House Democratic leadership and has been a key figure in the party's efforts to regain a majority in the House.\n\n###Declined to run\n\nSeveral other Democratic representatives, including Representative Jim Clyburn, Representative Nancy Pelosi, and Representative Steny Hoyer, did not run for the nomination. Clyburn and Pelosi had both served as Speaker in the past, while Hoyer had served as Majority Leader and Majority Whip.\n\n##Result\n\nThe Democratic nomination for Speaker was uncontested, with Jeffries being chosen as the party's candidate.\n\n#Republican nomination\n\nThe Republican Party nominated Representative Kevin McCarthy to be their candidate for Speaker.\n\n###Nominee\n\nKevin McCarthy is an American politician and businessman who has been a U.S. Representative for California's 23rd congressional district since 2007.

Scalise and Stefanik are members of the House Republican leadership, while Jordan is a member of the House Freedom Caucus.\n\n##Results\n\nIn a surprise move, McCarthy lost the Republican nomination for Speaker on the first ballot, with 201 votes to Stefanik's 200.\n\n#Election of the speaker\n\n##Background\n\nThe election of the Speaker was held on January 3, 2023, and was notable for being the first time in over a century that a Speaker was not chosen on the first ballot. The House was divided between Republicans and Democrats, with each party holding 218 seats.\n\n##Candidates\n\nThe two main candidates for Speaker were Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic nominee, and Kevin McCarthy, the Republican nominee.\n\n##Summary\n\nThe election of the Speaker was held in 15 rounds, with each round featuring a different candidate or combination of candidates. The final round saw Jeffries and McCarthy each receiving 212 votes, with 5 votes going to other candidates.\n\n##Ballots 1–3 (January 3)\n\nOn the first three ballots, McCarthy led the voting, with 217, 216, and 215 votes respectively. However, he failed to secure the necessary majority, and the election went into overtime.\n\n##Ballots 4–6 (January 4)\n\nOn the fourth, fifth, and sixth ballots, Jeffries and McCarthy continued to trade votes, with each receiving 213, 213, and 212 votes respectively.\n\n##Ballots 7–11 (January 5)\n\nOn the seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth, and eleventh ballots, the voting stabilized, with Jeffries and McCarthy each receiving 212 votes.\n\n##Ballots 12–15 (January 6)\n\nOn the twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth ballots, the voting remained unchanged, with Jeffries and McCarthy each receiving 212 votes.\n\n##All ballots: votes not cast for party nominee\n\nSeveral other candidates received votes in the election, including Representatives Andy Biggs, Mike Johnson, and Tom Cole.\n\n##All ballots: summary of votes\n\nA total of 425 votes were cast in the election, with 212 going to Hakeem Jeffries and 212 going to Kevin McCarthy.\n\n#Impact\n\n##Historical context\n\nThe election of the Speaker was notable for being the first time in over a century that a Speaker was not chosen on the first ballot.

It was characterized by a revival of classical Greek and Roman styles, a focus on realism and humanism, and a rise in the use of new materials and techniques. This period saw the creation of some of the most iconic and enduring works of art in human history, many of which can be found in museums and public spaces throughout Italy and the world.\n\n# Periods\n\nThe Italian Renaissance sculpture can be divided into several periods, each characterized by distinct styles and developments.\n\n## To 1400\n\nDuring the early 14th century, Italian sculpture was heavily influenced by the International Gothic style, which emphasized elegance, delicacy, and a sense of movement. This style can be seen in the works of artists such as Giovanni Pisano and Arnolfo di Cambio, who created intricate and ornate sculptures for church and civic buildings.\n\n## From 1400\n\nThe early 15th century saw the emergence of a new style, characterized by a focus on realism and humanism. This was exemplified by the work of artists such as Donatello and Masaccio, who created sculptures that were more naturalistic and expressive. This style was further developed by the mid-15th century, with artists such as Luca della Robbia and Mino da Fiesole creating intricate and ornate sculptures for churches and palaces.\n\n## Doors of the Florence Baptistery\n\nOne of the most famous examples of early 15th-century sculpture is the doors of the Florence Baptistery, created by Lorenzo Ghiberti in the early 1420s. This work was a major departure from the International Gothic style, and instead emphasized realism and humanism. The doors feature intricate reliefs depicting scenes from the Bible, and are considered some of the greatest works of art in the history of Italian sculpture.\n\n## Donatello\n\nDonatello is widely regarded as one of the greatest sculptors of the Italian Renaissance. He was a pioneer of the humanist style, and created many iconic works, including the bronze statue of David and the marble statue of Saint George. Donatello's work was characterized by a focus on realism and a sense of movement, and he was known for his use of innovative techniques and materials.\n\n## Middle of the century\n\nThe mid-15th century saw the emergence of a new style, characterized by a focus on elegance and refinement. This was exemplified by the work of artists such as Andrea del Verrocchio and Antonio Rossellino, who created intricate and ornate sculptures for churches and palaces.\n\n## Lombardy\n\nThe Lombardy region of northern Italy was also a center of artistic innovation during this period. Artists such as Cristoforo Mantegna and Giovanni Bellini created sculptures that were characterized by a sense of elegance and refinement, and were heavily influenced by the classical styles of ancient Greece and Rome.\n\n## Crisis of the 1490s\n\nThe 1490s saw a crisis in the Italian art world, with many artists struggling to adapt to the changing tastes and styles of the time. This was exemplified by the decline of the humanist style, and the emergence of a new style characterized by a focus on elegance and refinement.\n\n## 16th century\n\nThe 16th century saw the emergence of a new style, characterized by a focus on Mannerism and the use of new materials and techniques. This was exemplified by the work of artists such as Michelangelo and Giambologna, who created sculptures that were characterized by a sense of elegance and refinement.\n\n## Michelangelo\n\nMichelangelo is widely regarded as one of the greatest sculptors of all time. He was a pioneer of the Mannerist style, and created many iconic works, including the statue of David and the sculpture of the Pietà. Michelangelo's work was characterized by a focus on elegance and refinement, and he was known for his use of innovative techniques and materials.\n\n## Mannerist and Late Renaissance sculpture\n\nThe Mannerist style was characterized by a focus on elegance and refinement, and was exemplified by the work of artists such as Giambologna and Benvenuto Cellini. This style was further developed by the late Renaissance, with artists such as Jacopo Sansovino and Vincenzo de' Rossi creating sculptures that were characterized by a sense of grandeur and drama.\n\n## Giambologna\n\nGiambologna is widely regarded as one of the greatest sculptors of the Mannerist style. He was a pioneer of the use of new materials and techniques, and created many iconic works, including the statue of Mercury and the sculpture of the Rape of Proserpina. Giambologna's work was characterized by a focus on elegance and refinement, and he was known for his use of innovative techniques and materials.\n\n# Italians abroad\n\nMany Italian sculptors traveled abroad during this period, where they worked on commissions and created works that were influenced by local styles and materials. This was exemplified by the work of artists such as Michelangelo, who traveled to Rome and Florence, and created works that were characterized by a sense of elegance and refinement.\n\n# Settings\n\nThe settings in which Italian Renaissance sculpture was created varied widely, from the churches and tombs of northern Italy to the civic buildings and palaces of the south.\n\n## Churches and tombs\n\nMany Italian sculptors created works for churches and tombs, where they were commissioned to create intricate and ornate sculptures that were used to decorate the buildings and honor the deceased. This was exemplified by the work of artists such as Michelangelo, who created the sculpture of the Pietà for St. Peter's Basilica in Rome.\n\n## Civic pride\n\nThe Italian city-states were also a major center of artistic innovation during this period, with many sculptors creating works that were used to express civic pride and promote the interests of the city. This was exemplified by the work of artists such as Lorenzo Ghiberti, who created the doors of the Florence Baptistery, which were used to express the civic pride of the city.\n\n### Fountains\n\nMany Italian sculptors also created fountains, which were used to decorate public spaces and provide a source of water for the city. This was exemplified by the work of artists such as Bernini, who created the fountain of the Piazza Navona in Rome.\n\n## Portraits\n\nMany Italian sculptors also created portraits, which were used to commemorate the lives and achievements of individuals. This was exemplified by the work of artists such as Michelangelo, who created the statue of David, which was used to commemorate the life and achievements of the biblical hero.\n\n### Equestrian statues\n\nMany Italian sculptors also created equestrian statues, which were used to commemorate the lives and achievements of individuals. This was exemplified by the work of artists such as Donatello, who created the statue of Gattamelata, which was used to commemorate the life and achievements of the condottiere Ermolao Barbaro.\n\n### Shoulder busts\n\nMany Italian sculptors also created shoulder busts, which were used to commemorate the lives and achievements of individuals. This was exemplified by the work of artists such as Michelangelo, who created a number of shoulder busts, including one of the Pope Leo X.\n\n### Medals\n\nMany Italian sculptors also created medals, which were used to commemorate the lives and achievements of individuals. This was exemplified by the work of artists such as Benvenuto Cellini, who created a number of medals, including one of the Pope Clement VII.\n\n## Small sculpture\n\nMany Italian sculptors also created small sculpture, which was used to decorate private homes and public spaces. This was exemplified by the work of artists such as Lorenzo Ghiberti, who created a number of small sculptures, including the bronze reliefs that adorned the doors of the Florence Baptistery.\n\n# Workshops\n\nMany Italian sculptors worked in workshops, where they created works under the direction of a master artist. This was exemplified by the workshop of Michelangelo, where he trained a number of apprentices and assistants.\n\n## Women sculptors\n\nThere were a number of women sculptors who worked during this period, including Sofonisba Anguissola and Lavinia Fontana. These artists created works that were characterized by a sense of elegance and refinement, and were heavily influenced by the classical styles of ancient Greece and Rome.\n\n# Guilds\n\nThe guilds of Italian sculptors were a major force during this period, with many artists belonging to the Arte della Statua e del Marmo, which was the guild of sculptors and stone carvers. This guild was responsible for regulating the activities of its members and promoting the interests of the art.\n\n# Patrons\n\nThe patrons of Italian sculptors were a major force during this period, with many artists receiving commissions from wealthy and powerful individuals. This was exemplified by the work of artists such as Michelangelo, who received commissions from the Pope and other powerful patrons.\n\n# Development of style\n\nThe development of style in Italian Renaissance sculpture was a gradual process, with many artists experimenting with new techniques and materials. This was exemplified by the work of artists such as Donatello, who created sculptures that were characterized by a sense of movement and a focus on realism.\n\n## To 1400\n\nDuring the early 14th century, Italian sculpture was heavily influenced by the International Gothic style, which emphasized elegance, delicacy, and a sense of movement.

The history of Christianity is a complex and multifaceted one, spanning over two millennia. It has evolved over time, shaped by various cultural, social, and theological influences.\n\n**Early Christianity**\n\n### Jewish Background\n\nChristianity emerged from Judaism in the 1st century AD. The Jewish people had a long history of monotheism, with a covenant between God and the Israelites. The Hebrew Bible, also known as the Old Testament, contains the scriptures that were shared by both Jews and early Christians. Jesus, a Jewish rabbi, preached a message of God's love and redemption, which was seen as a continuation of the Jewish tradition.\n\n### Apostolic Age (c. 30–100)\n\n#### Developing Church Structure\n\nAfter Jesus' death and resurrection, his followers, known as the apostles, established a network of churches in the Mediterranean region. The apostles, including Peter, Paul, and James, played a crucial role in shaping the early Christian community. They established a hierarchical structure, with bishops and elders leading local churches. The apostolic age saw the development of Christian doctrine, worship, and practices.\n\n#### Early Growth\n\nChristianity spread rapidly throughout the Roman Empire, with the apostles and early missionaries preaching the gospel to Jews and Gentiles alike. The early Christian community was characterized by a sense of unity and shared purpose. They shared meals, worshiped together, and cared for one another. The early Christian movement was marked by a sense of excitement and expectation, as people believed that Jesus would return soon.\n\n### Ante-Nicene Period (100–312)\n\n#### Scripture\n\nThe ante-Nicene period saw the development of Christian scripture. The New Testament, which includes the Gospels, epistles, and other writings, was taking shape. The early Christian community recognized the importance of scripture in shaping their faith and practice. The New Testament writings were seen as authoritative, inspired by God, and essential for understanding the life, teachings, and message of Jesus.\n\n#### Early Christian Art\n\nEarly Christian art, which emerged in the 2nd century AD, reflected the spiritual and cultural context of the time. The art featured symbols, such as the fish, the anchor, and the Ichthys, which represented the Christian faith. Early Christian art also included depictions of Jesus, Mary, and other biblical figures.\n\n#### Persecutions and Legalization\n\nThe ante-Nicene period saw periods of persecution and legalization of Christianity. Christians faced persecution from Roman authorities, who saw them as a threat to the empire's stability. However, Emperor Constantine's conversion to Christianity in 312 AD marked a turning point, as Christianity became a tolerated religion.\n\n### Spread of Christianity to c. 300 AD\n\n#### Inclusivity, Women and Exclusivity\n\nEarly Christianity was characterized by inclusivity, with women playing a significant role in the community. Women like Phoebe and Priscilla were leaders in the early Christian movement. However, as Christianity grew and developed, exclusivity emerged, and women's roles became limited. Early Christian communities also debated the issue of Gentiles, with some arguing for exclusion.\n\n#### Moral Practices\n\nThe early Christian community emphasized moral practices, such as loving one's neighbor, caring for the poor, and avoiding idolatry. The apostle Paul wrote extensively on the importance of moral living, emphasizing the need for Christians to live out their faith in their daily lives.\n\n**Late Antiquity (313–476)**\n\n### Conversion of Constantine\n\nConstantine's conversion to Christianity marked a significant turning point in the history of Christianity. He became the first Christian emperor, and Christianity became a tolerated, if not the official, religion of the Roman Empire.\n\n### Christianity and the State\n\nThe conversion of Constantine led to a close relationship between Christianity and the state. The emperor saw Christianity as a means to unify the empire and promote stability. The Church, in turn, saw the emperor as a protector and benefactor.\n\n### Christianity and Polytheism\n\nThe conversion of Constantine also marked the beginning of the end of polytheism in the Roman Empire. Christianity's monotheistic message challenged the empire's traditional polytheistic practices. The Church, however, continued to engage with and incorporate elements of pre-Christian cultures and traditions.\n\n### Augustine's Ethic toward Jews\n\nAugustine, a prominent Christian theologian, developed an ethic toward Jews that emphasized the need for Christian-Jewish dialogue and cooperation. He argued that Jews should be treated with respect and dignity, and that Christianity should learn from Jewish tradition.\n\n### Developing Orthodoxy and Heresy\n\nThe late antique period saw the development of orthodoxy and heresy within the Church. The Council of Nicaea in 325 AD established the Nicene Creed, which became a defining statement of Christian doctrine. However, this period also saw the emergence of heresies, such as Arianism, which challenged the orthodox understanding of the Trinity.\n\n### Church of the East\n\nThe Church of the East, also known as the Nestorian Church, emerged in the 5th century AD. This church, with its bishopric in Seleucia-Ctesiphon, developed a distinct theology and practice, which was eventually rejected by the Eastern Orthodox Church.\n\n### Hospitals\n\nThe late antique period saw the emergence of hospitals, which became an essential institution in the Christian world. These hospitals, often run by monks and nuns, provided care for the sick, the poor, and the marginalized.\n\n### Art and Literature\n\nThe late antique period was marked by a flourishing of art and literature. Christian art and literature reflected the spiritual and cultural context of the time, with works such as the illuminated manuscripts of the Lindisfarne Gospels and the writings of St. Jerome.\n\n### Spread and Growth of Christianity\n\nChristianity continued to spread throughout the Roman Empire, with the Church establishing itself as a dominant force.

The city has a rich history dating back to the 18th century and has played a significant role in the regional economy and politics.\n\n**History**\n\n### Ancient History\n\nThe area where Mariupol is located today has been inhabited since ancient times. Archaeological excavations have revealed that the site was occupied by the ancient Greeks, who established a settlement here in the 6th century BC. The Greeks founded a city called \"Voskresenske\" and established trade relations with other Greek cities in the region.\n\n### Crimean Khanate\n\nIn the 14th century, the Crimean Khanate, a powerful Turkic state, conquered the region and made Voskresenske a major trading center. The city became an important hub for the trade of salt, wine, and other goods.\n\n### Cossack Period\n\nIn the 16th century, the Cossacks, a group of free warriors, established a settlement on the site of modern-day Mariupol. The Cossacks were attracted by the city's strategic location on the Azov Sea and its fertile soil. The Cossacks founded a fort, which they called \"Mariupol,\" and began to develop the surrounding area.\n\n### Russian Empire and Soviet Union\n\nIn 1780, the Russian Empire annexed the Crimean Khanate and incorporated the region of Mariupol into its territory. During the 19th century, Mariupol became a major industrial center, with the establishment of iron and steel factories, shipyards, and other manufacturing facilities. In 1920, the Soviet Union was established, and Mariupol became a major industrial and economic center in the Soviet Union.\n\n### World War II\n\nDuring World War II, Mariupol was occupied by German forces in 1942, and it became a major battleground.

The election was triggered by the resignation of Prime Minister Liz Truss on 20 October 2022, following a significant backlash to her mini-budget and economic policies. The election was held to determine the new leader of the Conservative Party and the next Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.\n\n#Background\n\n##Boris Johnson premiership and scandals\n\nThe Conservative Party leadership election was a culmination of a series of events that began during the premiership of Boris Johnson. Johnson became Prime Minister in July 2019, after winning the Conservative Party leadership election. However, his premiership was marked by several scandals and controversies, including the partygate scandal, where he was accused of breaching COVID-19 lockdown rules. This led to a significant backlash against Johnson, and he eventually lost a confidence vote in the Conservative Party in June 2022.\n\n##Leadership election to succeed Johnson\n\nFollowing the loss of the confidence vote, Johnson announced that he would resign as Prime Minister and Conservative Party leader. A leadership election was held to determine his successor, with Rishi Sunak eventually emerging as the winner. Sunak became the new Prime Minister and Conservative Party leader in October 2022.\n\n##Liz Truss premiership and scandals\n\nTruss, who was the Foreign Secretary at the time, announced her candidacy for the Conservative Party leadership election. She won the election and became the Prime Minister and Conservative Party leader in September 2022. However, her premiership was short-lived, as she faced a significant backlash to her mini-budget and economic policies. Her policies, including tax cuts and a freeze on corporation tax, were widely criticized by economists and experts, who argued that they would exacerbate the UK's economic crisis.\n\n##Calls for Truss's resignation\n\nTruss's economic policies and the subsequent market turmoil led to widespread criticism and calls for her resignation. The opposition parties, including the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats, called for her to step down. Even some Conservative MPs began to question her leadership, and there were reports of a potential leadership challenge.\n\n##Resignations and vote on fracking\n\nIn the midst of the crisis, two of Truss's closest allies, Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng and Chief Secretary to the Treasury Chris Philp, resigned from their positions. The resignations were seen as a significant blow to Truss's leadership, and there were reports of a potential vote of no confidence in the Conservative Party. On 14 October 2022, the Conservative Party held a vote on fracking, and 71% of MPs voted in favor of allowing fracking, despite the opposition from many environmentalists and local communities.\n\n##Liz Truss resigns\n\nOn 20 October 2022, Truss announced her resignation as Prime Minister and Conservative Party leader. She became the shortest-serving Prime Minister in UK history, serving for just 49 days. Her resignation marked the beginning of a new leadership election, which would determine the next Prime Minister and Conservative Party leader.\n\n#Campaign\n\nThe campaign for the Conservative Party leadership election began soon after Truss's resignation. Several candidates, including Rishi Sunak, Liz Truss's former Home Secretary Priti Patel, and former Health Secretary Sajid Javid, announced their candidacy. The campaign was marked by a series of debates and hustings, where the candidates set out their policies and vision for the Conservative Party.\n\n#Election process\n\nThe election process was held in accordance with the Conservative Party's rules. The first round of voting was held on 14 October 2022, where the candidates with the fewest votes were eliminated. The remaining candidates then proceeded to the second round of voting, which was held on 19 October 2022. The candidate with the lowest number of votes in the second round was eliminated, and the remaining candidates then proceeded to the final round of voting, which was held on 24 October 2022.\n\n#Candidates\n\n##Declared\n\nSeveral candidates declared their candidacy for the Conservative Party leadership election.

Several politicians and experts responded to the election, with some expressing their support for the candidates and others criticizing their policies.

The novel is a comprehensive work of art that combines elements of philosophy, history, literature, and visual art. It is a sprawling, three-volume epic that explores the intersection of aesthetics and politics, delving into the lives of artists, intellectuals, and revolutionaries.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe novel is set in the 1960s and follows the story of a fictional protagonist, a painter and writer who becomes embroiled in the revolutionary struggles of the time. The story takes place on multiple levels, moving from the abstract realm of artistic creation to the concrete world of politics and social change. The protagonist's journey is interspersed with philosophical musings, historical references, and literary allusions, creating a complex and layered narrative.\n\nAs the protagonist navigates the complexities of art and politics, he grapples with the tensions between creativity and ideology, individualism and collectivism. His experiences are shaped by his encounters with other artists, intellectuals, and revolutionaries, including famous figures like Bertolt Brecht and Walter Benjamin. Through their conversations and collective struggles, the protagonist comes to understand the significance of art as a means of resistance against oppressive systems.\n\n**Form Features and Structure**\n\nThe novel's form reflects its thematic concerns with aesthetics and resistance. The text is divided into three volumes, each with its own distinct character and style. The first volume is a more traditional narrative, while the second and third volumes become increasingly fragmented and experimental. This structure mirrors the protagonist's growing awareness of the complexities of art and politics, as well as his increasing disillusionment with traditional forms of artistic expression.\n\nThroughout the novel, Weiss employs a range of literary devices, including stream-of-consciousness narration, dialectical discussions, and visual descriptions. The text is also interspersed with quotes from various sources, including philosophy, literature, and art history. These quotes serve to underscore the connections between art, politics, and culture, as well as to challenge the protagonist's assumptions and perspectives.\n\n**History of Origins and Publication**\n\nWeiss began working on The Aesthetics of Resistance in the early 1960s, drawing inspiration from his own experiences as an artist and intellectual. He was particularly influenced by the revolutionary movements of the time, including the Cuban Revolution and the student protests in Paris. Weiss's research took him to various countries, including Sweden and the German Democratic Republic (GDR), where he encountered artists, intellectuals, and revolutionaries who shaped his ideas and perspectives.\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, Weiss struggled with writer's block, often feeling overwhelmed by the complexity and scope of his project. Despite these challenges, he persevered, driven by his passion for the novel and its themes. The third volume of the novel proved particularly difficult to complete, as Weiss grappled with the tensions between aesthetics and politics, as well as the limits of artistic expression.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Weiss began to see the novel as a comprehensive work of art, one that would encompass multiple forms and styles. He drew on his experiences in Sweden and the GDR, as well as his encounters with other artists and intellectuals. This new vision for the novel led to the creation of the three-volume epic that we know today.\n\n**Other Translations**\n\nThe Aesthetics of Resistance has been translated into numerous languages, including English, French, Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese. The novel has also been adapted into various forms, including a radio play and a film. These adaptations reflect the novel's themes and ideas, as well as its experimental style and structure.\n\n**Textual Forms**\n\nWeiss's novel is a work of intermedia, combining elements of literature, art, and visual culture. The text includes visual descriptions, quotes from various sources, and philosophical musings, creating a rich and complex narrative. The novel's experimental style reflects its concern with the intersection of aesthetics and politics, as well as the limits of artistic expression.\n\n**Artists and Artworks in the Novel**\n\nThe novel includes a range of artistic references, from the Divine Comedy to Central artworks. Weiss draws on his own experiences as an artist, as well as his encounters with other artists and intellectuals. These references serve to underscore the connections between art, politics, and culture, as well as to challenge the protagonist's assumptions and perspectives.\n\n**Divine Comedy**\n\nWeiss's novel is often compared to Dante's Divine Comedy, with its three-volume structure and philosophical themes. However, while Dante's work is a traditional epic, Weiss's novel is a more experimental and avant-garde work, reflecting its concern with the intersection of aesthetics and politics.\n\n**Central Artworks**\n\nThe novel includes a range of central artworks, from Bertolt Brecht's plays to Walter Benjamin's writings. Weiss draws on these works to create a complex and layered narrative, reflecting his concern with the intersections of art, politics, and culture.\n\n**Questions**\n\nThroughout the novel, Weiss poses a range of questions, from the nature of art and politics to the limits of human knowledge and understanding. These questions serve to underscore the complexity and uncertainty of the novel's themes, as well as the provisional nature of artistic expression.\n\n**Reception**\n\nThe Aesthetics of Resistance has received a range of reactions, from critics and readers alike. In Germany, the novel was seen as a challenging and provocative work, reflecting its concern with the intersection of aesthetics and politics. However, some critics saw the novel as overly complex and difficult to follow.\n\nWorldwide, the novel has been translated into numerous languages and adapted into various forms. However, its reception has been uneven, reflecting the complexity and uncertainty of its themes. Some readers have seen the novel as a work of avant-garde genius, while others have found it inaccessible and impenetrable.\n\n**Reading Groups**\n\nDespite these challenges, The Aesthetics of Resistance has been widely read and discussed, particularly in academic and intellectual circles. Reading groups and study groups have formed around the novel, reflecting its thematic concerns with art, politics, and culture.\n\n**Intermedial Reception**\n\nThe novel has also been the subject of intermedial reception, with various artists and intellectuals drawing on its themes and ideas. This reflects the novel's concern with the intersection of aesthetics and politics, as well as its status as a work of intermedia.\n\n**Radio Play**\n\nThe Aesthetics of Resistance has been adapted into a radio play, reflecting its themes and ideas. The play was produced in the 1980s and has been widely broadcast and discussed.\n\n**Film**\n\nThe novel has also been adapted into a film, reflecting its experimental style and structure.

The Lakota are a Native American tribe that traditionally resided in the Great Plains region of North America, primarily in what is now the states of North Dakota, South Dakota, and Montana. The Lakota religion is characterized by a deep connection to the natural world, a strong emphasis on spirituality and ritual, and a rich tradition of storytelling and oral history.\n\n# Definition and Classification\n\nThe Lakota religion is a polytheistic tradition that recognizes a vast array of spirits, each with its own distinct characteristics and roles. The Lakota believe in a complex web of spiritual energies that permeate the natural world, and they believe that humans are connected to these energies through their ancestors, the land, and the animals. The Lakota religion is often classified as an example of animism, a spiritual tradition that recognizes the sacredness of all living things.\n\n## Beliefs\n\n### Wakʽą and Wakʽą Tʽąką\n\nAt the heart of Lakota spirituality is the concept of Wakʽą, which can be translated as \"the Great Mystery\" or \"the Great Spirit.\" Wakʽą is seen as the ultimate source of all life and energy, and it is believed to be present in every aspect of the natural world. The Lakota believe that Wakʽą is a mysterious and unknowable force, and they approach it with reverence and respect. Wakʽą Tʽąką, or \"the People of the Great Mystery,\" are the spirits that serve as intermediaries between the world of humans and the world of Wakʽą.\n\n### Wakʽąpi\n\nWakʽąpi, or \"the Holy One,\" is a central figure in Lakota spirituality. Wakʽąpi is seen as a powerful and benevolent spirit who is responsible for creating the world and all living things. The Lakota believe that Wakʽąpi is present in every aspect of the natural world, and they seek to honor and respect this spirit through their rituals and ceremonies.\n\n### Cosmogony\n\nLakota cosmogony tells the story of the creation of the world and the origins of human life. According to this story, the world was created by Wakʽąpi from a primordial sea of darkness and chaos. The first humans were formed from the dust of the earth and were given the breath of life by Wakʽąpi. The Lakota believe that the creation story is a metaphor for the ongoing cycle of birth, growth, decay, and renewal that is present in all aspects of the natural world.\n\n### Spirit and Afterlife\n\nThe Lakota believe in an afterlife where the spirits of the deceased continue to exist and play an active role in the lives of the living. The Lakota believe that the spirits of the dead are present in the natural world and are capable of influencing the lives of the living through their actions and decisions. The Lakota also believe that the spirits of the dead are able to communicate with the living through various forms of divination and spiritual practices.\n\n### Animism and Kinship\n\nAnimism is a central aspect of Lakota spirituality, and it recognizes the sacredness of all living things. The Lakota believe that all living things are connected and interdependent, and they seek to honor and respect this connection through their rituals and ceremonies. The Lakota also believe in a concept of kinship that recognizes the sacred bonds between humans, animals, and the natural world.\n\n## Cosmology and the Sacred Hoop\n\nThe Lakota believe in a complex cosmology that recognizes the interconnectedness of all things. The Lakota believe that the world is a vast web of energies and relationships that are interconnected and interdependent. The Lakota also believe in a concept of the \"sacred hoop,\" which represents the interconnectedness of all things and the cycle of birth, growth, decay, and renewal that is present in all aspects of the natural world.\n\n## Morality and Gender Roles\n\nThe Lakota have a complex system of morality that recognizes the importance of balance, harmony, and respect for all living things. The Lakota believe in a concept of \"mitakuye oyasin,\" or \"we are all related,\" which recognizes the sacred bonds between humans, animals, and the natural world. The Lakota also have a system of gender roles that recognize the importance of balance and complementarity between masculine and feminine energies.\n\n# Practices\n\n## Prayer and Offerings\n\nPrayer and offerings are central aspects of Lakota spirituality, and they are used to honor and respect the spirits and the natural world. The Lakota believe that prayer and offerings are a way of acknowledging the interconnectedness of all things and the cycle of birth, growth, decay, and renewal that is present in all aspects of the natural world.\n\n### Suffering and Sacrifice\n\nThe Lakota believe in a concept of suffering and sacrifice that recognizes the importance of selflessness and generosity. The Lakota believe that suffering and sacrifice are ways of honoring and respecting the spirits and the natural world, and they seek to cultivate these qualities through their rituals and ceremonies.\n\n## The Sacred Pipe\n\nThe sacred pipe is a central object of Lakota spirituality, and it represents the connection between the world of humans and the world of the spirits. The Lakota believe that the sacred pipe is a symbol of peace, harmony, and balance, and they use it in their rituals and ceremonies to seek guidance and wisdom.\n\n## Sweat Lodge\n\nThe sweat lodge is a ritual space that is used by the Lakota for purification, healing, and spiritual growth. The Lakota believe that the sweat lodge is a way of cleansing the body and spirit, and they use it to seek guidance and wisdom from the spirits.\n\n## Vision Quest\n\nThe vision quest is a rite of passage that is used by the Lakota to mark important life transitions, such as birth, coming of age, and death. The Lakota believe that the vision quest is a way of seeking guidance and wisdom from the spirits, and they use it to cultivate qualities such as courage, strength, and wisdom.\n\n## Sun Dance\n\nThe sun dance is a ritual that is used by the Lakota to honor and respect the spirits and the natural world. The Lakota believe that the sun dance is a way of acknowledging the interconnectedness of all things and the cycle of birth, growth, decay, and renewal that is present in all aspects of the natural world.\n\n## Further Rites\n\nThe Lakota have a complex system of rituals and ceremonies that are used to honor and respect the spirits and the natural world. These rites include the \"Inipi,\" or \"sweat lodge,\" the \"Wanbli Galeshka,\" or \"eagle feather dance,\" and the \"Pte San Win,\" or \"bear ceremony.\"\n\n## Healing and Cursing\n\nThe Lakota believe in a concept of healing and cursing that recognizes the importance of balance and harmony in the natural world.

Yuwípi are spiritual leaders who are responsible for guiding the community and providing spiritual guidance. Yuwípi Wičháša are medicine men who are responsible for healing and providing spiritual guidance.\n\n### Other Specialists\n\nThe Lakota have a complex system of specialists who play important roles in their spiritual practices. These specialists include the \"Wanbli Galeshka,\" or \"eagle feather dancer,\" who is responsible for performing rituals and ceremonies, and the \"Pte San Win,\" or \"bear keeper,\" who is responsible for caring for the bear and performing rituals and ceremonies.\n\n# History\n\n## Prehistory\n\nThe Lakota have a rich and complex history that stretches back thousands of years. The Lakota were traditionally a nomadic people who roamed the Great Plains region of North America, primarily in what is now the states of North Dakota, South Dakota, and Montana. The Lakota were skilled hunters and warriors who were known for their bravery and martial skills.\n\n## Encounters with Christianity and Colonialism\n\nThe Lakota had their first encounters with Christianity and colonialism in the 16th century, when Spanish explorers arrived in the Great Plains region. The Lakota resisted the arrival of European colonizers and missionaries, but they were ultimately forced to adapt to the changing circumstances of the 19th century. The Lakota were forcibly relocated to reservations and were subjected to policies of assimilation and forced assimilation.\n\n## Revivalism\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, there was a revival of interest in Lakota spirituality and culture. This revival was led by spiritual leaders such as Charles Eastman and Luther Standing Bear, who sought to preserve and revitalize the traditions and practices of the Lakota people.\n\n# Demographics\n\nThe Lakota are a small and scattered people, with a total population of around 60,000 individuals. The Lakota are primarily located in the Great Plains region of North America, primarily in what is now the states of North Dakota, South Dakota, and Montana.\n\n# Reception and Influence\n\nThe Lakota have had a significant influence on American culture and society.

By joining forces, the Compact's founders sought to address these challenges and promote a more sustainable and inclusive publishing industry.\n\n**Commitments**\n\nThe SDG Publishers Compact is based on several key commitments, including:\n\n* Environmental sustainability: reducing the industry's carbon footprint and promoting eco-friendly practices\n* Inclusive publishing: increasing diversity and representation in publishing, particularly for marginalized communities\n* Fair trade: ensuring fair labor practices and fair compensation for authors and workers\n* Transparency: promoting transparency and accountability in publishing practices\n\n**Signatories**\n\nThe SDG Publishers Compact has attracted a significant number of signatories from around the world, including major publishers, independent presses, and online platforms.

Fellows receive training and mentorship, as well as access to resources and networks to help them launch their careers.\n\n**Actions**\n\nThe SDG Publishers Compact has implemented a range of actions to support its commitments and achieve its goals.

Amleth escapes and vows to avenge his father's death. He assumes a new identity, Amleth the Outlaw, and infiltrates his uncle's court, where he befriends a slave boy named Olmar (Ethan Hawke). As Amleth navigates the complexities of court politics, he becomes embroiled in a series of adventures that ultimately lead him to a confrontation with his uncle and the truth about his father's death.\n\nCast\n\n* Alexander Skarsgård as Amleth\n* Nicole Kidman as Queen Gudrun\n* Claes Bang as King Aurvandil\n* Björk as Sorceress\n* Anya Taylor-Joy as Olga\n* Ethan Hawke as Olmar\n* Karl Markovics as Fjölnir\n* Willem Dafoe as Heimir\n\nProduction\n\n### Development\n\nThe Northman was first announced in 2017, with Robert Eggers and Sjón writing the screenplay.

The film's sound design was created by a team of sound designers and mixers, who worked closely with Eggers to create a soundscape that was both realistic and immersive. The film's visual effects were also created by a team of visual effects artists, who used a combination of practical and CGI effects to enhance the film's visuals.\n\n### Music\n\nThe music for The Northman was composed by Antony Hegarty and performed by the Icelandic Symphony Orchestra. The score is a haunting and atmospheric mix of traditional and modern elements, which perfectly complements the film's themes and tone.\n\nMarketing\n\n### Tie-in media\n\nTo promote The Northman, a range of tie-in media was released, including a tie-in novelization and a companion book on the film's production design. The novelization was written by Sjón and provides a more detailed and in-depth look at the film's story and characters. The companion book on the film's production design was written by a team of experts and provides a behind-the-scenes look at the film's costumes, sets, and special effects.\n\nRelease\n\n### Theatrical\n\nThe Northman was released in theaters on April 22, 2022, in the United States and on April 29, 2022, in the United Kingdom.
