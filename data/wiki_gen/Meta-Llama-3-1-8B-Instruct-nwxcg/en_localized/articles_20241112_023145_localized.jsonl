The election was triggered by the resignation of the previous leader, Nicola Sturgeon, who announced her departure on February 15, 2023.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Scottish National Party (SNP) has been the governing party of Scotland since 2007, with Nicola Sturgeon serving as its leader since 2014. The party has been instrumental in promoting Scottish independence and has been a key player in the Scottish devolution process. The leadership election was the first in the party's history to be held while in government at Holyrood.\n\n**Issues**\n\nSeveral key issues dominated the leadership election campaign, including:\n\n### **Economics**\n\nThe Scottish economy has been a major concern for the SNP, with issues such as low unemployment, economic growth, and the impact of Brexit on the Scottish economy. The party's economic policies have been centered around increasing investment in key sectors such as renewable energy, manufacturing, and agriculture.\n\n### **Independence**\n\nThe SNP's commitment to Scottish independence has been a cornerstone of its policy platform. The party has advocated for a second referendum on Scottish independence, citing the UK's decision to leave the European Union as a significant factor in the need for Scotland to have its own sovereignty.\n\n### **Gender recognition reform**\n\nThe SNP has been at the forefront of efforts to reform Scotland's laws on gender recognition. The party has supported the introduction of self-identification for trans people, which would allow individuals to change their gender without the need for medical intervention.\n\n**Campaign**\n\nThe leadership election campaign began on February 15, 2023, when Nicola Sturgeon announced her resignation. The nomination period was open from February 15 to March 3, 2023, during which time candidates could declare their intention to stand.\n\n### **Nomination period**\n\nA total of four candidates declared their intention to stand during the nomination period: Kate Forbes, Ash Regan, Humza Yousaf, and Kaukab Stewart. The other two candidates who initially expressed interest in standing, Stewart McDonald and Mairi McAllan, declined to nominate themselves.\n\n### **Kate Forbes**\n\nKate Forbes, the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and the Economy, was a strong contender for the leadership. Forbes has been a member of the SNP since 2007 and has held several key posts within the party, including deputy leader. She was seen as a strong candidate due to her experience and policy expertise.\n\n### **Ash Regan**\n\nAsh Regan, the former Minister for Community Safety, was another strong contender for the leadership. Regan has been a member of the SNP since 2007 and has held several key posts within the party, including deputy leader. She was seen as a strong candidate due to her experience and policy expertise.\n\n### **Humza Yousaf**\n\nHumza Yousaf, the current Health Secretary, was a surprise contender for the leadership. Yousaf has been a member of the SNP since 2007 and has held several key posts within the party, including deputy leader. He was seen as a strong candidate due to his experience and policy expertise.\n\n### **Hustings**\n\nThe hustings were a key part of the leadership election campaign, with each candidate participating in several debates and meetings with party members. The hustings provided an opportunity for candidates to set out their policy platforms and to engage with party members.\n\n### **Row about membership numbers**\n\nA row erupted during the leadership election campaign over the accuracy of the SNP's membership numbers. The party's leadership claimed that the membership had increased significantly during the campaign, while some critics suggested that the numbers were inflated. The dispute highlighted the tension within the party over issues such as membership and democratic reform.\n\n**Election process**\n\nThe election process was conducted under the SNP's party rules, which provide for a leadership election to be held every two years. The party's membership voted for their preferred candidate, with the winner being determined by a simple majority.\n\n**Candidates**\n\nA total of four candidates stood in the leadership election:\n\n### **Declared**\n\n* Kate Forbes\n* Ash Regan\n* Humza Yousaf\n* Kaukab Stewart\n\n### **Declined**\n\n* Stewart McDonald\n* Mairi McAllan\n\n**Endorsements**\n\nSeveral senior party members endorsed the candidates during the leadership election campaign:\n\n### **Kate Forbes**\n\n* Nicola Sturgeon\n* Angus Robertson\n\n### **Ash Regan**\n\n* Anas Sarwar\n* Monica Lennon\n\n### **Humza Yousaf**\n\n* Nicola Sturgeon\n* Angela Constance\n\n### **Declined to endorse**\n\n* Stewart McDonald\n* Mairi McAllan\n\n**Debates**\n\nThe hustings debates provided a key opportunity for candidates to set out their policy platforms and to engage with party members. The debates were broadcast live on television and online, allowing members to watch and participate in the discussions.\n\n**Hustings**\n\nThe hustings were a key part of the leadership election campaign, with each candidate participating in several debates and meetings with party members.\n\n**Opinion polling**\n\nSeveral opinion polls were conducted during the leadership election campaign to gauge public opinion on the candidates and the party's policy platform. The polls provided a snapshot of the party's membership's views on the candidates and the issues.\n\n### **SNP membership**\n\n* 70% of SNP members supported Kate Forbes as their preferred candidate.\n* 20% supported Ash Regan.\n* 10% supported Humza Yousaf.\n\n### **2021 SNP voters**\n\n* 60% of SNP voters in the 2021 Scottish Parliament election supported Kate Forbes as their preferred candidate.\n* 30% supported Ash Regan.\n* 10% supported Humza Yousaf.\n\n### **Scottish public**\n\n* 50% of the Scottish public supported Kate Forbes as their preferred candidate.\n* 30% supported Ash Regan.\n* 20% supported Humza Yousaf.\n\n**Results**\n\nThe results of the leadership election were announced on March 27, 2023. The winner of the election was:\n\n* Humza Yousaf (63.6% of the vote)\n\n### **Preference votes by candidate**\n\n* Humza Yousaf: 63.6%\n* Kate Forbes: 26.3%\n* Ash Regan: 10.1%\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe leadership election result was a surprise to many in the party, with Humza Yousaf emerging as the winner.

The fifth installment in the Indiana Jones franchise, it stars Harrison Ford reprising his role as the titular character, alongside Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Thomas Kretschmann, and Mads Mikkelsen.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film takes place in 1969, during the final days of World War II. Indiana Jones, a retired professor of archaeology, is living in New York City with his goddaughter, Helena Shaw. When a mysterious German agent, Jürgen Voller, begins to search for a powerful ancient artifact known as the Dial of Destiny, Indiana is drawn back into the world of adventure.\n\nAs Indiana searches for the Dial, he discovers that it has the power to manipulate time itself, and that Voller plans to use it to alter the course of history.

James Mangold was brought on board as director in 2014, and the film underwent significant changes over the next several years.\n\n### Pre-production\n\nPre-production on the film began in 2020, with Harrison Ford and Phoebe Waller-Bridge confirmed to star.

The team was led by visual effects supervisor, Paul Franklin, and included a team of artists and technicians from around the world.\n\n### De-aging\n\nThe film's visual effects team used a de-aging technique to make Harrison Ford appear younger in certain scenes. The technique involved using a combination of CGI and makeup to create a more youthful appearance for the actor.\n\n### Music\n\nThe film's score was composed by John Williams, who has worked on the Indiana Jones franchise since the first film. The score incorporates a range of musical themes and motifs, including the iconic \"Raiders March\" theme.\n\n**Themes and influences**\n\nThe film explores a range of themes, including the consequences of altering the past, the power of knowledge, and the importance of family.

In South Africa, testate succession is governed by various laws and regulations, which are outlined below.\n\n# Freedom of Testation\n\nIn South Africa, testators have the freedom to dispose of their property as they see fit in their will. This means that they can leave their property to anyone they choose, including family members, friends, charities, or even their pets.\n\n## Limitations\n\nHowever, there are certain limitations to this freedom of testation. The following are some of the key limitations:\n\n### Illegal Dispositions and Those Against Public Policy\n\nA testator cannot make a disposition that is illegal or against public policy. For example, a testator cannot leave their property to someone who has committed a crime or who is involved in an illegal activity.\n\n### Subdivision of Agricultural Land\n\nA testator cannot divide their agricultural land in a way that is not in accordance with the law. For example, if the testator owns a farm, they cannot leave it to someone who is not a farmer or who does not have the necessary skills to manage the farm.\n\n### Subdivision of Mineral Rights\n\nA testator cannot divide their mineral rights in a way that is not in accordance with the law. For example, if the testator owns mineral rights on their farm, they cannot leave them to someone who is not a miner or who does not have the necessary skills to manage the mineral rights.\n\n### Fideicommissum Multiplex\n\nA testator cannot make a fideicommissum (a type of trust) that is not in accordance with the law. For example, a testator cannot leave their property to a fideicommissary (the person who benefits from the trust) if the fideicommissary is not a suitable person to manage the property.\n\n### Maintenance of Surviving Spouse\n\nA testator cannot leave their spouse without adequate maintenance. In South African law, a surviving spouse is entitled to maintenance from the estate of the deceased spouse.\n\n### Maintenance and Education of Minor Children\n\nA testator cannot leave their minor children without adequate maintenance and education. In South African law, minor children are entitled to maintenance and education from the estate of the deceased parent.\n\n### Pension Funds\n\nA testator cannot leave their pension fund to anyone other than their spouse or children. In South African law, pension funds are normally paid out to the spouse or children of the deceased person.\n\n## Delegation\n\nA testator can delegate the administration of their estate to a trustee or executor. This means that the testator can appoint someone to manage their estate on their behalf.\n\n## Customary Law\n\nIn some cases, customary law may apply to testate succession. This means that the laws and traditions of a particular community or culture may be taken into account when distributing the estate of a deceased person.\n\n# Testamentary Capacity\n\nIn order for a will to be valid, the testator must have testamentary capacity. This means that the testator must have the mental ability to make a will and to understand the implications of their decisions.\n\n## Mental Ability of the Testator\n\nThe testator must have the mental ability to understand the nature and extent of their property, as well as the implications of their decisions. This means that the testator must be able to understand the consequences of their actions and to make informed decisions.\n\n## Undue Influence on the Testator\n\nThe testator must not be subject to undue influence from others. This means that the testator must be free to make their own decisions without being pressured or coerced by others.\n\n# Capacity to Witness a Will\n\nIn order for a will to be valid, it must be witnessed by two or more witnesses. These witnesses must be capable of witnessing a will, which means that they must be of sound mind and must not be related to the testator.\n\n# Formalities for Execution of a Will\n\nIn order for a will to be valid, it must be executed in accordance with certain formalities. These formalities include:\n\n## Requirements for a Testamentary Disposition\n\nA testamentary disposition must be in writing and must be signed by the testator. It must also be witnessed by two or more witnesses.\n\n## Methods of Executing a Valid Will\n\nA valid will can be executed in several ways. These include:\n\n* Writing and signing the will in the presence of witnesses\n* Executing a holographic will (a will that is written and signed by the testator in their own handwriting)\n* Executing a nuncupative will (a will that is made orally and is witnessed by two or more people)\n\n## Signing and Signature\n\nA will must be signed by the testator. The signature must be in the testator's own handwriting, unless the testator is unable to write.\n\n## Certificate\n\nA will must be witnessed by two or more witnesses. The witnesses must sign a certificate stating that they witnessed the will.\n\n## Witnesses\n\nThe witnesses to a will must be of sound mind and must not be related to the testator. They must also be capable of witnessing a will.\n\n# Condonation\n\nIn some cases, a will may be considered to be condoned. This means that the testator may have made a mistake in their will, but the mistake is not so serious that it invalidates the will.\n\n# Invalid Wills\n\nIn some cases, a will may be invalid. This means that the will is not valid and cannot be used to distribute the estate of the deceased person.\n\n## Revocation\n\nA will can be revoked in several ways. These include:\n\n* Writing and signing a new will\n* Executing a codicil (a document that amends a will)\n* Physically or symbolically destroying the will\n* Ademding (removing a gift from the will)\n* Other means of revocation\n\n## Right of Revocation\n\nA testator has the right to revoke their will at any time. This means that they can change their mind and make a new will.\n\n## Manner\n\nA will can be revoked in several ways. These include:\n\n* Writing and signing a new will\n* Executing a codicil (a document that amends a will)\n* Physically or symbolically destroying the will\n* Ademding (removing a gift from the will)\n* Other means of revocation\n\n## Later Will or Codicil\n\nA later will or codicil can revoke a previous will.\n\n## Physical or Symbolic Destruction\n\nA physical or symbolic destruction of a will can revoke the will.\n\n## Ademption\n\nA gift can be ademded (removed) from a will.\n\n## Other Means of Revocation\n\nOther means of revocation include:\n\n* Divorce or annulment of marriage (which can revoke a will that leaves property to a spouse)\n* Death (which can revoke a will that leaves property to a person who has died)\n\n## Exceptions to the General Rule that a Will Can be Revoked\n\nThere are several exceptions to the general rule that a will can be revoked. These include:\n\n* A will that is made in contemplation of marriage (which cannot be revoked after the marriage takes place)\n* A will that is made in contemplation of a child (which cannot be revoked after the child is born)\n* A will that is made for the benefit of a charity (which cannot be revoked)\n\n## Revival of a Revoked Will\n\nA revoked will can be revived in several ways. These include:\n\n* Writing and signing a new will that revives the revoked will\n* Executing a codicil that revives the revoked will\n* Physically or symbolically restoring the revoked will\n\n# Alteration or Variation\n\nIn some cases, a will may be altered or varied. This means that the testator may make changes to their will, but the changes are not so significant that they invalidate the will.\n\n## Amendment by Testator\n\nThe testator can amend their will by making changes to the original will.\n\n## Rectification by Court\n\nThe court can rectify a will by making changes to the original will.\n\n## Alteration or Variation by the Court\n\nThe court can alter or vary a will by making changes to the original will.\n\n# Incorporation by Reference\n\nA will can incorporate other documents by reference. This means that the testator can refer to other documents, such as a letter or a contract, as part of their will.\n\n# Obsolete and Provincial Wills\n\nIn some cases, a will may be considered to be obsolete or provincial. This means that the will is not valid or is not in accordance with the laws of the province where it was made.\n\n# Joint or Mutual Wills\n\nA joint or mutual will is a will that is made by two or more people together. This means that the will is made by two or more people who are married or in a relationship.\n\n# Probate of Wills\n\nProbate of a will is the process of proving that a will is valid and that the executor has the authority to manage the estate of the deceased person.\n\n## Lost Wills\n\nA lost will can be probated if the executor can prove that the will existed and that it was made by the deceased person.\n\n# Content of Wills\n\nThe content of a will can include various things, such as:\n\n## Inheritance and Legacy\n\nA will can leave property to individuals, including family members and friends.\n\n## Prior and Legal Rights\n\nA will can take into account prior and legal rights, such as rights of inheritance and rights of survivorship.\n\n## Vested, Conditional and Future Interests\n\nA will can create vested, conditional and future interests in property.\n\n## Vested Interests\n\nA vested interest is an interest that is already in existence and is not subject to any conditions.\n\n## Conditional Interests\n\nA conditional interest is an interest that is subject to certain conditions, such as the condition that the beneficiary must survive the testator.\n\n## Future Interests\n\nA future interest is an interest that will come into existence at a future time, such as an interest that will arise when a beneficiary reaches a certain age.\n\n## Valid and Invalid Conditions\n\nA condition can be valid or invalid.

The election was part of the 2022 general election, which also included elections for the House of Representatives, the Senate, and local positions.\n\nBackground\n\nThe 2022 presidential election was the 17th presidential election in the Philippines since the country's independence from Spain in 1898. The election was a significant event in the country's history, with various candidates vying for the top positions. The election was also notable for being the first presidential election to be held under the new electoral system, which features a highly automated and voter-verified system.\n\nElectoral System\n\nThe 2022 Philippine presidential election used a unique electoral system, which consists of a combination of a first-past-the-post system and a ranking system. Under the system, voters were required to rank the candidates for president and vice president in order of preference.

{"title": "First_period_houses_in_Massachusetts_(1660–1679)", "content": "#Legend\n#1660–1670\n#1671–1679\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**First Period Houses in Massachusetts (1660–1679)**\n\nThe First Period of Massachusetts architecture refers to the period of building construction in the province of Massachusetts Bay from approximately 1629 to 1720. However, a more specific and widely accepted definition for First Period houses in Massachusetts ranges from 1660 to 1679. This period saw the construction of some of the oldest surviving houses in the United States, many of which have been preserved and are now recognized as significant examples of colonial American architecture.\n\n### Legend\n\nIn 1910, the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities (SPNEA) published a list of 166 homes in Massachusetts that were built before 1725. This list helped to establish the concept of First Period houses, focusing on the earliest surviving examples of colonial American architecture. The SPNEA's list of homes, which included numerous buildings from the 1660-1679 period, laid the foundation for the study and preservation of First Period houses.\n\n### 1660–1670\n\nDuring the 1660s, Massachusetts was experiencing rapid population growth, driven in part by the increasing number of English settlers. As the colony expanded, the demand for new housing grew, leading to the construction of many new homes, particularly in the eastern part of the colony, near Boston. This period saw the development of traditional New England house forms, including the saltbox, the gambrel, and the central-chimney house.\n\n**Saltbox Houses**\n\nOne of the most iconic First Period house forms is the saltbox, which evolved from a traditional English house type known as the \"hall and parlor.\" The saltbox features a long, narrow body with a steeply pitched roof, often with a single window on each side and a central chimney. The saltbox was popular in Massachusetts, particularly in the eastern part of the colony, where it provided a practical and efficient solution for the needs of busy families.\n\n**Gambrel Houses**\n\nThe gambrel house, also known as the \"hip roof\" house, is characterized by a steeply pitched roof with two slopes on each side. This design allowed for more storage space in the attic, which was a valuable commodity in colonial Massachusetts. The gambrel house was often used for larger homes, as it provided more living space and a more impressive appearance.\n\n**Central-Chimney Houses**\n\nThe central-chimney house is a traditional New England house form that features a central chimney, often with a large fireplace and chimney stack. This design allowed for greater warmth and light in the home, making it an attractive option for families in Massachusetts. The central-chimney house was often used for smaller homes, as it provided a more modest and affordable solution for busy families.\n\n### 1671–1679\n\nDuring the 1670s, Massachusetts continued to experience rapid growth and development, with the population increasing by more than 50% between 1670 and 1679. This period saw the construction of many new homes, particularly in the western part of the colony, near modern-day Springfield.\n\n**Influence of the English Civil War**\n\nThe English Civil War, which took place from 1642 to 1651, had a significant impact on the development of First Period houses in Massachusetts. The war led to the displacement of many English settlers, who were forced to flee to the New World in search of safety and opportunity.

(formerly known as Facebook, Inc.). The app allows users to share text posts, similar to Twitter, but with the option to add multimedia content such as photos and videos. Threads was launched in July 2023 and has generated significant interest and controversy in the tech industry and beyond.\n\n**History**\n\n### Predecessor\n\nPrior to the launch of Threads, Meta had experimented with various social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. However, the company had been exploring the idea of a new social media app focused on short-form text-based content for several years.\n\n### Development and announcement\n\nIn 2022, Meta announced that it was working on a new social media app called Threads, which was initially codenamed \"Xenna.\" The app was developed by a team led by Adam Mosseri, the head of Instagram, and was designed to be a separate entity from Instagram and Facebook.\n\n### Launch\n\nThreads was launched on July 5, 2023, with a sleek and minimalist design. The app allows users to share text posts, photos, and videos, and also allows them to add links and other types of content. The app also features a \"reactions\" system, similar to Instagram, which allows users to respond to posts with different emotions and reactions.\n\n**Appearance and features**\n\n### Possibility of open interoperability\n\nOne of the key features of Threads is its potential for open interoperability. The app is designed to allow users to share content seamlessly between Threads and other social media platforms, including Instagram and Facebook. This means that users can share content from one platform to another without having to manually copy and paste it.\n\n### Account integration with Instagram\n\nThreads also allows users to integrate their Instagram accounts with the app, which means that users can access their Instagram content and followers directly within Threads. This integration also allows users to share content between the two platforms.\n\n### Device compatibility\n\nThreads is available on both iOS and Android devices, and can be accessed on mobile and web platforms.\n\n### Censorship attempts\n\nIn the months following its launch, Threads faced several attempts at censorship, including allegations of spreading misinformation and hate speech. In response, Meta implemented various measures to moderate content on the platform, including AI-powered moderation tools.\n\n### Advertising\n\nThreads also features a range of advertising options, including sponsored content and native ads. The app allows brands to reach a wider audience and engage with users in a more targeted way.\n\n**Userbase**\n\n### Decline in the months after launch\n\nIn the months following its launch, Threads experienced a decline in user engagement and growth. The app faced competition from other social media platforms, including Twitter and TikTok, which were already established as leaders in the space.\n\n### Popularity in Taiwan\n\nDespite the decline in user engagement, Threads experienced significant popularity in Taiwan, where the app became one of the most popular social media platforms among young people. The app's popularity in Taiwan was attributed to its ease of use and the fact that it was seen as a more authentic and community-driven platform compared to other social media platforms.\n\n**Responses**\n\n### Intellectual property dispute\n\nIn the months following its launch, Threads faced an intellectual property dispute with a New York-based company called Threads LLC. The company claimed that Meta had infringed on its trademark and sought damages. However, the dispute was ultimately resolved out of court.\n\n### Data privacy\n\nThreads also faced criticism over its data privacy policies, which were seen as overly broad and invasive. In response, Meta implemented various measures to improve data transparency and user control.\n\n### State media\n\nIn some countries, Threads faced criticism for its perceived bias towards state media and propaganda. In response, Meta implemented various measures to moderate content and prevent the spread of misinformation.\n\n### Imitating other platforms\n\nDespite its unique features and design, Threads has been accused of imitating other social media platforms, including Twitter and Instagram.

The path takes its name from the numerous prehistoric nuragic towers that dot the landscape, a testament to the island's rich cultural heritage. The trail is approximately 500 kilometers long and takes trekkers through a diverse range of landscapes, from the rugged coastal cliffs to the rolling hills and forests of the interior.\n\n**History**\n\nThe history of the Path of the 100 Towers is closely tied to the prehistoric nuragic civilization that flourished on the island of Sardinia between 1900 and 700 BCE. During this period, the Sardinians built numerous nuraghi, or towers, which served as fortifications, temples, and tombs. Many of these towers have survived to this day, and they are a major attraction for trekkers and tourists alike. The Path of the 100 Towers was likely used by the ancient Sardinians as a trade route, connecting the coastal towns and cities with the interior of the island.\n\n**Trekking routes**\n\nThe Path of the 100 Towers is divided into several sections, each with its own unique character and attractions. Trekkers can choose to tackle the entire route in one go, or break it down into smaller sections and tackle it over several days or weeks. The trail is generally well-marked and well-maintained, but trekkers should be prepared for rugged terrain and variable weather conditions.\n\n*   The western section of the trail begins in the town of Alghero and takes trekkers through the rugged coastal cliffs and beaches of the northwestern coast.\n*   The central section of the trail begins in the town of Nuoro and takes trekkers through the rolling hills and forests of the interior.\n*   The eastern section of the trail begins in the town of Tortolì and takes trekkers through the rugged coastal cliffs and beaches of the southeastern coast.\n\n**Towers**\n\nThe Path of the 100 Towers is home to numerous prehistoric nuragic towers, each with its own unique character and history. Some of the most notable towers include:\n\n*   **Su Nuraxi**: Located near the town of Barumini, Su Nuraxi is one of the best-preserved nuraghi on the island and dates back to the 13th century BCE.\n*   **Su Tempio**: Located near the town of Cagliari, Su Tempio is a large nuragic complex that includes a tower, a temple, and several tombs.\n*   **Su Monte**: Located near the town of Nuoro, Su Monte is a small but well-preserved nuragic tower that dates back to the 9th century BCE.\n\n**Main towers**\n\nSome of the main towers along the path include:\n\n*   **Su Nuraxi**: Located near the town of Barumini, Su Nuraxi is one of the best-preserved nuraghi on the island and dates back to the 13th century BCE.\n*   **Su Tempio**: Located near the town of Cagliari, Su Tempio is a large nuragic complex that includes a tower, a temple, and several tombs.\n*   **Su Monte**: Located near the town of Nuoro, Su Monte is a small but well-preserved nuragic tower that dates back to the 9th century BCE.\n\n**Flora and Fauna**\n\nThe Path of the 100 Towers is home to a diverse range of flora and fauna, including:\n\n*   **Mediterranean scrub**: The trail passes through a variety of Mediterranean scrub habitats, including sclerophyllous forests, maquis, and garrigue.\n*   **Lagoon**: The trail passes through several coastal lagoons, including the lagoon of Cabras and the lagoon of Tharros.\n\n**Mediterranean scrub**\n\nThe Mediterranean scrub is a type of vegetation that is characteristic of the Mediterranean region. It is composed of drought-resistant plants such as oak, pine, and heath, and is often associated with rocky outcrops and sandy soils.\n\n**Lagoon**\n\nLagoons are shallow bodies of water that are connected to the sea by a narrow channel. They are often found in coastal areas and are home to a diverse range of plant and animal species.\n\n**Books**\n\nThere are several books that provide information about the Path of the 100 Towers, including:\n\n*   **\"The Nuragic Civilization of Sardinia\"** by Giuseppe Manno: This book provides an overview of the nuragic civilization that flourished on the island of Sardinia between 1900 and 700 BCE.\n*   **\"The Path of the 100 Towers\"** by Mario Puddu: This book provides a detailed guide to the Path of the 100 Towers, including its history, attractions, and practical information for trekkers.\n\n**Curiosities**\n\nThe Path of the 100 Towers is home to a number of curious and interesting attractions, including:\n\n*   **The nuragic towers**: The path is home to numerous prehistoric nuragic towers, each with its own unique character and history.\n*   **The lagoons**: The path passes through several coastal lagoons, including the lagoon of Cabras and the lagoon of Tharros.\n*   **The Mediterranean scrub**: The path passes through a variety of Mediterranean scrub habitats, including sclerophyllous forests, maquis, and garrigue.\n\n**Similar treks**\n\nThere are several other treks in Sardinia that are similar to the Path of the 100 Towers, including:\n\n*   **The Gennargentu National Park**: This national park is located in the central part of the island and is home to a number of hiking trails, including the Gennargentu trek.\n*   **The Supramonte National Park**: This national park is located in the northeastern part of the island and is home to a number of hiking trails, including the Supramonte trek.\n\n**See also**\n\n*   **Nuragic Civilization of Sardinia**\n*   **Gennargentu National Park**\n*   **Supramonte National Park**\n\n**Gallery**\n\n*   [Image: Su Nuraxi]\n*   [Image: Su Tempio]\n*   [Image: Su Monte]\n*   [Image: Mediterranean scrub]\n*   [Image: Lagoon]\n\n**References**\n\n*   **\"The Nuragic Civilization of Sardinia\"** by Giuseppe Manno\n*   **\"The Path of the 100 Towers\"** by Mario Puddu\n\n**External links**\n\n*   [Sardinia Tourism Board]\n*   [Italian National Parks]\n*   [The Nuragic Civilization of Sardinia]", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The effects of climate change are varied and complex, affecting different regions and communities in distinct ways.\n\n**Changes in Temperature**\n\nTemperature is one of the most obvious indicators of climate change. The average global temperature has risen by about 1°C since the late 19th century, and the 20 warmest years on record have all occurred since 1981. This increase in temperature is primarily due to the emission of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, which trap heat in the atmosphere.\n\n**Weather**\n\nClimate change affects weather patterns, leading to more frequent and severe weather events. Some of the most notable effects of climate change on weather include:\n\n### **Heat Waves and Temperature Extremes**\n\nHeat waves are prolonged periods of abnormally hot weather, often resulting in heat-related illnesses and deaths. The frequency and duration of heat waves have increased in recent years, with some regions experiencing heat waves that last for weeks or even months. Temperature extremes, such as record-breaking high temperatures, are also becoming more common.\n\n### **Rain**\n\nClimate change is altering precipitation patterns, leading to more frequent and intense rainfall events. Heavy rainfall can cause flooding, landslides, and other hazards. In some regions, droughts are becoming more common, while in others, heavy rainfall is becoming more frequent.\n\n### **Extreme Storms**\n\nExtreme storms, such as hurricanes, typhoons, and cyclones, are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change. These storms can cause catastrophic damage, including flooding, landslides, and storm surges.\n\n**Land**\n\nClimate change affects land in various ways, including:\n\n### **Floods**\n\nFloods are becoming more common due to climate change, particularly in low-lying areas and coastal regions. Heavy rainfall, storm surges, and sea level rise contribute to flooding, which can cause damage to infrastructure, displacement of people, and loss of life.\n\n### **Droughts**\n\nDroughts are becoming more common in some regions, particularly in areas with changing precipitation patterns. Droughts can have significant impacts on agriculture, water resources, and human health.\n\n### **Wildfires**\n\nClimate change is increasing the risk of wildfires, particularly in regions with dry vegetation and hot temperatures. Wildfires can cause significant damage to the environment, infrastructure, and human health.\n\n**Oceans**\n\nClimate change affects the oceans in various ways, including:\n\n### **Sea Level Rise**\n\nSea level rise is one of the most significant effects of climate change on oceans. As the polar ice caps and glaciers melt, sea levels rise, leading to coastal erosion, flooding, and saltwater intrusion into freshwater sources.\n\n**Ice and Snow**\n\nClimate change affects ice and snow in various ways, including:\n\n### **Glaciers Decline**\n\nGlaciers are melting at an alarming rate, with some glaciers losing up to 90% of their mass in the past century. This decline in glaciers contributes to sea level rise and alters global ocean circulation patterns.\n\n### **Ice Sheets Decline**\n\nIce sheets in Antarctica and Greenland are also declining due to climate change. The collapse of these ice sheets could lead to catastrophic sea level rise and changes in global ocean circulation patterns.\n\n### **Sea Ice Decline**\n\nSea ice in the Arctic is declining at an alarming rate, with some areas experiencing a 40% decline in sea ice coverage over the past few decades. This decline in sea ice contributes to changes in ocean circulation patterns, marine ecosystems, and human health.\n\n### **Permafrost Thawing**\n\nPermafrost, a layer of soil and rock that remains frozen for two or more consecutive years, is thawing due to climate change. This thawing of permafrost releases methane, a potent greenhouse gas, and contributes to changes in global ocean circulation patterns.\n\n**Wildlife and Nature**\n\nClimate change affects wildlife and nature in various ways, including:\n\n### **Ecosystems on Land**\n\nClimate change is altering ecosystems on land, leading to changes in species composition, distribution, and behavior. Some species are migrating to new habitats, while others are becoming extinct due to climate change.\n\n### **Marine Ecosystems**\n\nClimate change is affecting marine ecosystems, including coral reefs, kelp forests, and phytoplankton communities. Changes in ocean temperature, pH, and circulation patterns are altering the distribution and abundance of marine species.\n\n**Tipping Points and Irreversible Impacts**\n\nClimate change is pushing the Earth's systems towards tipping points, beyond which there may be no return to a previous state.

It is a binary indexed tree, which is a cache-efficient data structure that allows for fast updates and queries. The Fenwick tree is particularly useful for solving problems that involve cumulative sums or prefix sums, such as calculating the sum of all elements up to a given index or finding the index of the first element that exceeds a certain value.\n\n**Motivation**\n\nThe Fenwick tree was first introduced by Peter Fenwick in 1994 as a data structure for efficient calculation of prefix sums. The tree is named after its creator, who is also a well-known researcher in the field of data compression. The Fenwick tree has since been widely adopted in various applications, including computer science, engineering, and finance.\n\n**Description**\n\nA Fenwick tree consists of three main components: the interrogation tree, the update tree, and the search tree.\n\n### The Interrogation Tree\n\nThe interrogation tree is a binary tree that represents the prefix sums of the input array. Each node in the tree corresponds to an element in the array, and the value of each node represents the sum of the elements in the subtree rooted at that node. The interrogation tree is used to answer queries about the prefix sums of the input array.\n\n### The Update Tree\n\nThe update tree is a binary tree that represents the updates to the input array. Each node in the update tree corresponds to an element in the array, and the value of each node represents the change in the element's value. The update tree is used to update the prefix sums stored in the interrogation tree.\n\n### The Search Tree\n\nThe search tree is a binary tree that represents the search operations on the input array. Each node in the search tree corresponds to an element in the array, and the value of each node represents the index of the element in the array. The search tree is used to find the index of the first element that exceeds a certain value.\n\n**Pseudocode**\n\nThe following pseudocode illustrates the construction of a Fenwick tree:\n\n### Construction\n\n```\nProcedure ConstructFenwickTree(array):\n  Create an empty Fenwick tree\n  For i from 0 to n-1:\n    Initialize the node at position i in the Fenwick tree to 0\n  For i from 0 to n-1:\n    Calculate the prefix sum at position i\n    Update the node at position i in the Fenwick tree to the prefix sum\n  Return the constructed Fenwick tree\n\nProcedure QueryFenwickTree(index):\n  Calculate the prefix sum up to the given index\n  Return the prefix sum\n\nProcedure UpdateFenwickTree(index, value):\n  Update the value of the node at the given index in the Fenwick tree\n  Update the prefix sums of the nodes in the subtree rooted at the given index\n\nProcedure SearchFenwickTree(target):\n  Find the index of the first element that exceeds the target value\n  Return the index\n```\n\n**See also**\n\n* Binary indexed tree\n* Prefix sum\n* Cumulative sum\n* Data structure\n* Algorithm\n\n**External links**\n\n* Peter Fenwick's homepage\n* Fenwick tree implementation in C++\n* Fenwick tree implementation in Java\n* Fenwick tree implementation in Python", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

Robert Oppenheimer\n\nJ. Robert Oppenheimer was an American theoretical physicist and director of the Manhattan Project, the secret research and development project that produced the atomic bomb during World War II. He is considered one of the most influential scientists of the 20th century, and his work had a profound impact on the development of modern physics.\n\n**Early Life**\n\n### Childhood and Education\n\nBorn on April 22, 1904, in New York City, Oppenheimer was the first of two children to Ella Greene and Julius Oppenheimer, a textile importer. His family was Jewish and secular, and Oppenheimer's early life was marked by a strong emphasis on education and intellectual pursuits. He was a shy and introverted child, but his parents encouraged his curiosity and supported his love of science and mathematics.\n\nOppenheimer attended the Ethical Culture School in New York City, where he excelled academically and developed a passion for learning. In 1921, he enrolled at Harvard University, where he studied chemistry and physics. He graduated in 1925, but his academic career was interrupted by a year-long trip to Europe, where he studied at the University of Cambridge and the University of Göttingen.\n\n### Studies in Europe\n\nIn Europe, Oppenheimer was exposed to the latest developments in theoretical physics, particularly the work of Albert Einstein and Niels Bohr. He spent several months at the University of Cambridge, where he was influenced by the work of J.J. Thomson and Arthur Eddington. He also spent several months at the University of Göttingen, where he was influenced by the work of Max Born and Werner Heisenberg.\n\nOppenheimer's time in Europe was a formative period in his academic career. He developed a deep understanding of quantum mechanics and relativity, and he was exposed to the latest developments in theoretical physics. He also began to develop his own research interests, which would eventually lead him to become a leading figure in the development of quantum field theory.\n\n**Early Career**\n\n### Teaching\n\nAfter returning to the United States in 1927, Oppenheimer took up a teaching position at the University of California, Berkeley. He was a young and promising physicist, and he quickly established himself as a leading researcher in the field of theoretical physics. He was appointed as a professor of physics at Berkeley in 1929, and he spent several years teaching and conducting research at the university.\n\nDuring his time at Berkeley, Oppenheimer made significant contributions to the development of quantum mechanics. He worked closely with his colleagues, including Ernest Lawrence and Robert Millikan, to establish the university's physics department as a leading center for research in theoretical physics.\n\n### Scientific Work\n\nOppenheimer's scientific work during the 1930s was focused on the development of quantum field theory, a theoretical framework that aimed to describe the behavior of subatomic particles in terms of fields rather than particles. He worked closely with his colleagues, including Paul Dirac and Werner Heisenberg, to develop the theory, which would eventually become a cornerstone of modern particle physics.\n\nOppenheimer's work on quantum field theory was highly influential, and it laid the foundation for many of the advances in particle physics that would follow in the decades that followed. He also made significant contributions to the development of nuclear physics, and he worked closely with his colleagues to establish the field of nuclear physics as a distinct area of research.\n\n**Private and Political Life**\n\n### Politics\n\nOppenheimer was a vocal critic of fascism and Nazism, and he was deeply concerned about the rise of totalitarianism in Europe during the 1930s. He was a strong supporter of liberal democracy and human rights, and he was a vocal advocate for the protection of minority rights.\n\nIn 1939, Oppenheimer was a key figure in the development of the American Committee for Anti-Nazi Literature, a organization that aimed to promote anti-Nazi literature and ideas in the United States. He was also a key figure in the development of the American Committee for Democracy and Intellectual Freedom, a organization that aimed to promote intellectual freedom and democracy in the face of fascist and Nazi ideology.\n\n### Relationships and Children\n\nOppenheimer married Katherine \"Kitty\" Puening in 1940, and they had two children together, Teller and Toni. He was a devoted father and husband, and he placed great value on family life.\n\n### Mysticism\n\nOppenheimer was interested in mysticism and the nature of consciousness, and he spent much of his later life exploring these interests. He was particularly interested in the work of Carl Jung and the concept of the collective unconscious.\n\n**Manhattan Project**\n\n### Los Alamos\n\nIn 1942, Oppenheimer was appointed as the director of the Manhattan Project, a secret research and development project that aimed to produce the atomic bomb during World War II. He was based at Los Alamos, New Mexico, where he worked closely with his colleagues to develop the bomb.\n\nOppenheimer's work on the Manhattan Project was highly influential, and it had a profound impact on the course of the war. He was a key figure in the development of the bomb, and he played a leading role in the decision to use it against Japan.\n\n### Bomb Design\n\nOppenheimer was responsible for the design of the atomic bomb, and he worked closely with his colleagues to develop the theoretical framework for the device. He was a key figure in the development of the implosion design, which was used to detonate the bomb.\n\n### Trinity\n\nOn July 16, 1945, Oppenheimer witnessed the first nuclear test, code-named \"Trinity,\" at the Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range in New Mexico. The test was a success, and it marked a major milestone in the development of the atomic bomb.\n\n**Postwar Activities**\n\n### Institute for Advanced Study\n\nAfter the war, Oppenheimer returned to the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, where he had been a professor before the war. He was a key figure in the development of the institute, and he played a leading role in the development of the field of theoretical physics.\n\n### Atomic Energy Commission\n\nIn 1947, Oppenheimer was appointed as a member of the General Advisory Committee of the Atomic Energy Commission, a agency responsible for regulating nuclear energy in the United States. He was a key figure in the development of the commission's policies, and he played a leading role in the development of the field of nuclear energy.\n\n### Panels and Study Groups\n\nOppenheimer was a member of several panels and study groups, including the JASON group, a group of scientists and engineers who advised the US government on scientific and technical matters.
