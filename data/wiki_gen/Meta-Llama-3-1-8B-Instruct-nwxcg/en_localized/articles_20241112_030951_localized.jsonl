It is one of the most common and effective methods for treating cataracts, a clouding of the natural lens in the eye that can impair vision.\n\n**Uses**\n\nCataract surgery is used to treat cataracts that are causing vision problems. Cataracts can cause blurred vision, double vision, sensitivity to light, and difficulty driving at night. In some cases, cataracts can cause pain and discomfort. Cataract surgery is typically recommended for individuals who have a significant impact on their daily activities due to cataracts.\n\n**Techniques**\n\nThere are several techniques used in cataract surgery, including:\n\n* **Phacoemulsification**: This is the most common technique used in cataract surgery. It involves making a small incision in the cornea and using an ultrasonic device to break up the cataractous lens into small pieces. The pieces are then suctioned out of the eye.\n* **Manual small incision cataract surgery (MSICS)**: This technique involves making a small incision in the cornea and removing the cataractous lens in one piece. The lens is then replaced with an IOL.\n* **Extracapsular cataract extraction**: This technique involves making a larger incision in the cornea and removing the cataractous lens in one piece. The lens is then replaced with an IOL.\n\n**Pre-operative evaluation**\n\nBefore undergoing cataract surgery, patients undergo a thorough evaluation to determine the best course of treatment. This evaluation includes:\n\n* **Contraindications**: Patients with certain medical conditions, such as diabetes, glaucoma, or age-related macular degeneration, may not be good candidates for cataract surgery.\n* **Selection of intraocular lenses**: Patients are evaluated to determine the best type of IOL to use. This includes determining the patient's prescription, the size of the pupil, and the degree of astigmatism.\n\n**Operation procedures**\n\nThe cataract surgery procedure typically involves the following steps:\n\n* **Preparation**: The patient is given local anesthesia to numb the eye and a small incision is made in the cornea.\n* **Anaesthesia**: The patient is given either local anesthesia or general anesthesia to numb the eye.\n* **Phacoemulsification**: The cataractous lens is broken up into small pieces using an ultrasonic device and suctioned out of the eye.\n* **Manual small incision cataract surgery (MSICS)**: The cataractous lens is removed in one piece and replaced with an IOL.\n* **Extracapsular cataract extraction**: The cataractous lens is removed in one piece and replaced with an IOL.\n* **Converting to ECCE to manage a contingency**: In some cases, the surgeon may need to convert the procedure to an extracapsular cataract extraction to manage a contingency, such as a central iris defect.\n* **Closing the wound**: The incision is closed with sutures or a special type of glue.\n\n**Post-operative care**\n\nAfter the surgery, patients are given instructions on how to care for their eye, including:\n\n* **Eye drops**: Patients are given eye drops to help prevent infection and promote healing.\n* **Pain medication**: Patients are given pain medication to manage any discomfort.\n* **Rest**: Patients are advised to rest and avoid strenuous activities for several days.\n\n**Complications**\n\nComplications can occur during or after cataract surgery. These include:\n\n* **During surgery**: Complications that can occur during surgery include:\n\t+ **Intraocular lens dislocation**: The IOL can become dislocated, requiring additional surgery to reposition it.\n\t+ **Intraocular lens tilt**: The IOL can become tilted, requiring additional surgery to reposition it.\n\t+ **Retinal detachment**: The retina can detach, requiring additional surgery to reattach it.\n* **After surgery**: Complications that can occur after surgery include:\n\t+ **Infection**: Patients can develop an infection, such as endophthalmitis, which can require additional treatment.\n\t+ **Cystoid macular edema**: Patients can develop cystoid macular edema, a condition that can cause vision loss.\n\t+ **Glaucoma**: Patients can develop glaucoma, a condition that can cause vision loss.\n\n**Risk**\n\nCataract surgery carries risks, including:\n\n* **Loss of vision**: Patients can experience loss of vision, including blindness.\n* **Infection**: Patients can develop an infection, such as endophthalmitis.\n* **Cystoid macular edema**: Patients can develop cystoid macular edema.\n* **Glaucoma**: Patients can develop glaucoma.\n\n**Recovery and rehabilitation**\n\nThe recovery and rehabilitation process for cataract surgery typically takes several weeks to several months. During this time, patients may experience:\n\n* **Eye drops**: Patients may need to use eye drops to help prevent infection and promote healing.\n* **Pain medication**: Patients may need to use pain medication to manage any discomfort.\n* **Rest**: Patients may need to rest and avoid strenuous activities for several weeks.\n* **Follow-up appointments**: Patients will need to follow up with their surgeon for several appointments to monitor their progress.\n\n**Outcomes**\n\nThe outcomes of cataract surgery can vary depending on the individual patient. In general, the surgery is highly effective in restoring vision and improving quality of life. However, some patients may experience complications or loss of vision.\n\n**History**\n\nCataract surgery has a long history dating back thousands of years. The first recorded cataract surgery was performed in ancient India around 1000 BCE. The surgery was performed using a needle to remove the cataractous lens.\n\n**Accessibility**\n\nCataract surgery is widely available in many parts of the world, including:\n\n* **Europe**: Cataract surgery is widely available in Europe, with many countries having high-quality eye care systems.\n* **Asia**: Cataract surgery is widely available in Asia, with many countries having high-quality eye care systems.\n* **Africa**: Cataract surgery is becoming more widely available in Africa, with many countries having high-quality eye care systems.\n* **Latin America**: Cataract surgery is widely available in Latin America, with many countries having high-quality eye care systems.\n\n**Social, economic and environmental relevance**\n\nCataract surgery has significant social, economic, and environmental relevance. In many parts of the world, cataracts are a major cause of blindness, and cataract surgery can restore vision and improve quality of life. Additionally, cataract surgery can have significant economic benefits, as it can improve productivity and reduce the economic burden of blindness.\n\n**Special populations**\n\nCataract surgery has special considerations for certain populations, including:\n\n* **Congenital cataracts**: Congenital cataracts are cataracts that occur at birth. These cataracts require special treatment and often require surgery to restore vision.\n* **Higher risk for operations on separate occasions**: Some patients may have a higher risk for complications or loss of vision during cataract surgery. These patients may require additional treatment or special precautions.\n\n**Other animals**\n\nCataract surgery is not limited to humans.

The company is a leading player in the construction industry, providing a range of services including construction, civil engineering, and property development.\n\nHistory\n\n### Main contractor\n\nThe Shepherd Building Group was founded in 1842 by Thomas Shepherd, a Scottish stonemason. The company started as a small building firm in Edinburgh, Scotland, and over the years, it expanded its operations to become one of the largest construction companies in the UK.\n\nIn the early 20th century, the company began to focus on large-scale construction projects, including bridges, roads, and buildings. During World War II, the company worked on various military projects, including the construction of airfields and other military infrastructure.\n\n### Manufactured products\n\nIn addition to its construction services, the Shepherd Building Group also manufactures a range of building products, including timber frame systems, roofing materials, and wall insulation. The company's manufactured products are used in a variety of construction projects, from residential buildings to commercial developments.\n\nThe company's manufactured products are designed to meet the needs of the construction industry, and are made from high-quality materials that are durable and long-lasting. The company's products are used by a range of customers, including builders, developers, and architects.\n\n### Disposal of non-core businesses\n\nIn recent years, the Shepherd Building Group has disposed of several non-core businesses, including its timber framing operation and its wall insulation business. The company has focused on its core construction services, and has invested in new technology and equipment to improve its efficiency and competitiveness.\n\nNotable construction projects\n\nThe Shepherd Building Group has worked on a range of notable construction projects over the years, including:\n\n* The Forth Road Bridge in Scotland, which was completed in 1964 and is one of the longest suspension bridges in the world.\n* The M1 motorway in England, which was completed in 1959 and is one of the busiest motorways in the UK.\n* The Glasgow Science Centre in Scotland, which was completed in 2001 and is a popular tourist attraction.\n* The Trinity Walk shopping centre in Wakefield, England, which was completed in 2001 and is one of the largest shopping centres in the UK.\n\nControversies\n\n### Identity behind anonymous emails\n\nIn 2011, the Shepherd Building Group was involved in a controversy surrounding anonymous emails sent to the company's employees. The emails, which were sent by an unnamed individual, contained malicious and threatening content, and were intended to cause disruption and stress to the company's employees.\n\nThe company's management took swift action to investigate the matter and to identify the person behind the emails. The investigation was conducted in conjunction with the police, and resulted in the identification of the individual responsible for sending the emails.\n\n### Hand tool vibration\n\nIn 2013, the Shepherd Building Group was involved in a controversy surrounding hand tool vibration. The company was sued by a number of employees who claimed that they had suffered from hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS) as a result of using power tools on site.\n\nThe company denied the allegations, and argued that it had implemented a number of measures to reduce the risk of HAVS, including providing training to employees and providing them with high-quality power tools.\n\n### Domain name disputes\n\nIn 2015, the Shepherd Building Group was involved in a dispute over its domain name. The company's website was hacked, and an individual attempted to register the company's domain name for their own use.\n\nThe company's management took swift action to resolve the dispute, and worked with its IT department to secure the website and to prevent further unauthorized access.\n\n### Employment blacklisting\n\nIn 2016, the Shepherd Building Group was involved in a controversy surrounding employment blacklisting. The company was accused of blacklisting employees who had raised concerns about the company's working practices.\n\nThe company denied the allegations, and argued that it had always maintained a fair and transparent employment practice. However, an investigation by the company's HR department revealed that a number of employees had been blacklisted, and the company took steps to rectify the situation.\n\n### Trinity Walk\n\nThe Shepherd Building Group has also been involved in a controversy surrounding the Trinity Walk shopping centre in Wakefield, England. The company was accused of failing to provide adequate services to the centre, including failing to maintain the centre's car park and failing to provide adequate security.\n\nThe company denied the allegations, and argued that it had always maintained a high standard of service at the centre. However, an investigation by the company's management revealed that there were a number of issues with the centre's services, and the company took steps to rectify the situation.\n\nSee also\n\n* Construction industry\n* Civil engineering\n* Property development\n* Building products\n* Timber frame systems\n* Roofing materials\n* Wall insulation\n* Hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS)", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The black market was a complex network of clandestine transactions, hidden stockpiling, and grey market activities that circumvented official controls and regulations. This article will explore the background, origins, users, public response, and response by authorities to the black market in wartime France.\n\n**Background**\n\n### 1930s: Inflation, Instability, and Unrest\n\nThe 1930s were marked by economic instability, inflation, and social unrest in France. The global economic crisis of the Great Depression had a devastating impact on the French economy, leading to high levels of unemployment, poverty, and social discontent. The French government implemented a series of austerity measures, including price controls and rationing, which further exacerbated the economic crisis.\n\n### Fall of France\n\nThe fall of France in June 1940 marked a significant turning point in the country's history. The German occupation of France led to a severe disruption of the economy, with the French government forced to implement harsh austerity measures to meet the demands of the occupying power. The black market, which had existed in France before the war, began to flourish as a means of circumventing official controls and regulations.\n\n**1940-1941**\n\n### Origins\n\n#### Rationing and Price Controls\n\nThe French government implemented a series of rationing and price controls in an attempt to manage the economic crisis. However, these measures had the unintended consequence of creating a black market in goods and services. The rationing system was strict, with citizens allocated a limited amount of food, fuel, and other essential goods. However, the prices of these goods were set at artificially low levels, making it difficult for producers to sell their products at a profit.\n\n#### Diversion from Official Channels\n\nAs the economy continued to deteriorate, many producers and traders began to divert their goods and services from official channels to the black market. This was done in order to avoid the strict controls and regulations imposed by the government, as well as to capitalize on the higher prices offered by the black market.\n\n#### Clandestine Networks\n\nThe black market in France was characterized by a complex network of clandestine transactions and hidden stockpiling. Goods and services were traded in secret, often through intermediaries or middlemen. This created a culture of secrecy and mistrust, as individuals were forced to operate in the shadows in order to avoid detection by the authorities.\n\n#### Hidden Stockpiling\n\nMany individuals and businesses began to stockpile goods and supplies in anticipation of future shortages or price increases. This created a situation in which goods were held back from the market, further exacerbating the economic crisis.\n\n#### Grey Market\n\nThe grey market, which existed alongside the black market, referred to the sale of goods and services at prices higher than those set by the government, but lower than those offered by the black market. This created a complex pricing system, with different levels of prices and levels of risk associated with each.\n\n### Users of the Black Market\n\n#### Privileged French\n\nThe black market was not limited to the French population. Many members of the French elite, including politicians, business leaders, and other influential individuals, also participated in the black market. This created a situation in which the privileged French were able to acquire goods and services that were not available to the general population.\n\n#### Occupation Forces\n\nThe German occupation forces also participated in the black market, often using their power and influence to acquire goods and services at favorable prices. This created a situation in which the occupying power was able to exploit the French population, further exacerbating the economic crisis.\n\n### Public Response\n\n#### Early Condemnation\n\nThe black market was initially condemned by the French government and many members of the public. However, as the economic crisis continued to worsen, many individuals began to participate in the black market in order to meet their basic needs.\n\n#### Participation\n\nThe black market became a way of life for many French citizens. People began to trade goods and services in secret, often through intermediaries or middlemen. This created a culture of secrecy and mistrust, as individuals were forced to operate in the shadows in order to avoid detection by the authorities.\n\n#### Housewives' Demonstrations\n\nMany housewives began to organize demonstrations and protests in order to draw attention to the shortages and price increases caused by the black market. These demonstrations were often met with violence and repression by the authorities, further exacerbating the situation.\n\n#### Suspicions of Hoarding\n\nAs the black market continued to thrive, many individuals began to suspect that others were hoarding goods and supplies. This created a climate of mistrust and suspicion, as individuals were forced to operate in the shadows in order to avoid detection by the authorities.\n\n#### Official Antisemitism\n\nThe black market also became a target of official antisemitism. Many Jews were accused of participating in the black market, often as a means of justifying the persecution and expulsion of Jewish communities.\n\n#### Public Opinion\n\nPublic opinion on the black market was complex and divided. Many individuals saw the black market as a necessary evil, a means of circumventing the strict controls and regulations imposed by the government. Others saw the black market as a threat to the economy and society, a manifestation of the economic crisis and social unrest.\n\n### Response by Authorities\n\nThe authorities responded to the black market with a series of measures, including increased enforcement and repression. However, these measures were often ineffective, as the black market continued to thrive.\n\n#### Tacit Tolerance\n\nAs the black market continued to grow, many authorities began to show a tacit tolerance for its existence. This created a situation in which the authorities were complicit in the black market, often through corruption and bribery.\n\n### Metrics\n\n#### Proportion of Production\n\nThe black market accounted for a significant proportion of production in France, often exceeding 50% of total production.\n\n#### Higher and More Volatile Prices\n\nPrices on the black market were often higher and more volatile than those on the official market, creating a complex pricing system.\n\n#### Geographic Distribution\n\nThe black market was widespread, with activity concentrated in urban areas, particularly in Paris.\n\n#### Beneficiaries\n\nThe beneficiaries of the black market were often the wealthy and influential individuals, who were able to acquire goods and services at favorable prices.\n\n**Widespread Black Market (Autumn 1941 to 1943)**\n\n### Agricultural Black Market\n\nThe agricultural black market was a significant sector of the black market, with farmers and producers selling their goods and supplies on the black market in order to avoid the strict controls and regulations imposed by the government.\n\n### Grey Market: Direct Sales\n\nThe grey market, which existed alongside the black market, referred to the sale of goods and services at prices higher than those set by the government, but lower than those offered by the black market. This created a complex pricing system, with different levels of prices and levels of risk associated with each.\n\n### Commerce and Industry\n\nThe black market also affected commerce and industry, with many businesses and entrepreneurs participating in the black market in order to meet their basic needs and capitalize on the higher prices offered by the black market.\n\n### Tacit Tolerance\n\nAs the black market continued to grow, many authorities began to show a tacit tolerance for its existence. This created a situation in which the authorities were complicit in the black market, often through corruption and bribery.\n\n### Nuanced and Refocused Enforcement\n\nHowever, as the black market continued to thrive, the authorities began to show a more nuanced and refocused approach to enforcement. This included increased surveillance and monitoring of black market activity, as well as targeted enforcement actions against key players and leaders in the black market.\n\n**Patriotism (Spring 1943-Summer 1944)**\n\n### Enforcement for the Occupiers\n\nAs the German occupation continued, the authorities began to focus on enforcing the black market for the benefit of the occupying power. This created a situation in which the black market was used to exploit the French population and further exacerbate the economic crisis.\n\n### Economic Pillage and the End of the German Black Market\n\nThe end of the German black market was marked by a period of economic pillage, as the occupying power sought to extract as much wealth and resources as possible from the French economy.\n\n### Countermeasures and Collaboration\n\nHowever, as the Allies began to gain ground, the authorities began to take countermeasures against the black market, including increased enforcement and repression. This created a situation in which the black market was forced to adapt and evolve, often through collaboration with the authorities.\n\n### Milice vs the Black Market\n\nThe Milice, a French paramilitary organization, was established to combat the black market and other forms of resistance against the occupying power. However, the Milice often found itself at odds with the authorities, who were complicit in the black market.\n\n### Fraud and Resistance\n\nThe black market was also a target of resistance, with many individuals and groups using the black market as a means of resisting the occupying power and the authorities. This created a situation in which the black market was used as a tool of subversion and sabotage.\n\n### Resistance Encouragement\n\nHowever, as the war drew to a close, the authorities began to show a more nuanced approach to the black market, often encouraging resistance and subversion through the black market.\n\n### Blaming the Resistance\n\nHowever, as the war drew to a close, the authorities began to blame the Resistance for the black market, often using this as a means of justifying the persecution and expulsion of Jewish communities.\n\n### End of the Occupation\n\nThe end of the occupation marked the end of the black market, as the French government and authorities began to take control of the economy and establish a new system of market regulation.\n\n**After the Liberation (1944-1949)**\n\n### Épuration and Illicit Profits\n\nAs the war drew to a close, the authorities began to take measures against those involved in the black market, including épurations and confiscations of illicit profits.\n\n### Pursuit and Punishment\n\nHowever, many individuals and businesses involved in the black market were able to evade punishment and continue to operate, often through corruption and bribery.\n\n### Confiscation of Illicit Profits\n\nThe authorities also began to confiscate illicit profits, often using this as a means of financing the reconstruction of the economy.\n\n### Continued Black Market Operations\n\nHowever, the black market continued to thrive, often through corruption and bribery.\n\n### Continued Trafficking\n\nMany individuals and businesses continued to engage in trafficking, often through the black market.\n\n### Generalized Fraud\n\nThe black market also led to a culture of generalized fraud, with many individuals and businesses engaging in deceit and dishonesty.\n\n### Government Powerlessness\n\nHowever, the government was powerless to stop the black market, often through corruption and bribery.\n\n### Towards the Free Market\n\nHowever, as the French economy began to recover, the government began to shift towards a free market economy, often through liberalization and deregulation.\n\n**Historical Memory**\n\n### Historiography\n\nThe history of the black market in France is complex and nuanced, with many different interpretations and perspectives.\n\n### Collective Unconscious and Cultural Roots\n\nThe black market has left a lasting impact on French culture and society, often through the collective unconscious.\n\n### Early Recollections\n\nMany individuals have early recollections of the black market, often through stories and anecdotes passed down through generations.\n\n### Marcel Aymé\n\nThe French writer Marcel Aymé was a prominent figure in the black market, often using his writing to critique and satirize the black market.\n\n### Major Works\n\nAymé's major works, such as \"La Traversée de Paris\" and \"Au bon beurre\", often explored the themes of the black market and its impact on society.\n\n### Historical Figures\n\nMany historical figures, such as L'Étrange Monsieur Joseph, were involved in the black market, often through corruption and bribery.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Black market\n* French Resistance\n* German occupation of France\n* Épuration\n* Illicit profits\n* Trafficking\n* Fraud\n* Corruption\n* Bribery\n* Liberalization\n* Deregulation\n* Free market economy\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The article is based on a variety of sources, including historical accounts, academic research, and primary documents.\n* The article is intended to provide a comprehensive and neutral overview of the black market in France during World War II.\n* The article is not intended to promote or glorify the black market, but rather to provide a factual and informative account of its history and impact.\n\n**References**\n\n* [List of sources used in the article]\n\nNote: This article is a work of collaborative writing and has not been edited or reviewed by a single editor.

The new series is expected to be a spin-off of the original series and will follow a new cast of characters.\n\nThe future of the Fantastic Beasts franchise is also uncertain due to the controversy surrounding J.K. Rowling's views on trans issues.

The film is the third installment in the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise, following Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017). The movie is scheduled to be released in 2023.\n\nPlot\n\nThe plot of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is shrouded in mystery, but it is expected to conclude the story arc of the original Guardians team. According to James Gunn, the film will explore the consequences of the events of the previous two movies, and it will delve deeper into the characters' backstories and emotional journeys. The story is expected to be more mature and darker than its predecessors, with a focus on the characters' growth and development.\n\nCast\n\nThe cast of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 includes:\n\n* Chris Pratt as Peter Quill/Star-Lord\n* Zoe Saldana as Gamora\n* Dave Bautista as Drax the Destroyer\n* Vin Diesel as Groot\n* Bradley Cooper as Rocket Raccoon\n* Karen Gillan as Nebula\n* Pom Klementieff as Mantis\n* Michael Rooker as Yondu Udonta\n* Sylvester Stallone as Stakar Ogord\n* Danai Gurira as Ayesha\n* Helen Mirren as Monica Rambeau\n* Chukwudi Iwuji as High Evolutionary\n\nProduction\n\n### Development\n\nInitial work on Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 began in 2017, shortly after the release of the second film. James Gunn announced that he was working on the script, and he hinted that the movie would explore the consequences of the events of the previous two films. In 2018, Gunn revealed that the film would be a more emotional and introspective experience, with a focus on the characters' growth and development.\n\n### Firing of James Gunn\n\nIn July 2018, Disney fired James Gunn from the project after old tweets surfaced that were deemed to be insensitive and offensive. The tweets, which were from 2008 and 2009, included jokes about pedophilia and rape. Gunn apologized for the tweets, but Disney stood by its decision to fire him.\n\n### Rehiring Gunn\n\nIn March 2019, Disney announced that it was rehiring James Gunn to direct Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. The decision was met with widespread approval from fans and critics, who praised Disney for giving Gunn a second chance.\n\n## Pre-production\n\nPre-production on Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 began in earnest in 2019, with James Gunn working on the script and assembling the cast and crew. The film's budget was reportedly around $250 million, making it one of the most expensive Marvel movies to date.\n\n## Filming\n\nFilming on Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 began in October 2019 and wrapped up in March 2020.

In 2000, she joined the Centre for Policy Studies, a right-wing think tank, where she worked as a researcher. In 2005, she was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for the constituency of South West Norfolk. Truss served as a backbencher for several years, during which time she spoke out on various issues, including taxation and education.\n\n### Backbencher (2010–2012)\n\nIn 2010, Truss was appointed as a spokesperson for the Conservative Party on education and children's issues. She also served as a member of the Education Select Committee. During this time, Truss advocated for school reform and the introduction of academy schools.\n\n### Education under-secretary (2012–2014)\n\nIn 2012, Truss was appointed as the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education. In this role, she worked closely with the Secretary of State for Education, Michael Gove, to implement education reforms.\n\n### Environment secretary (2014–2016)\n\nIn 2014, Truss was appointed as the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. During her time in this role, she introduced measures to reduce plastic waste and protect the environment.\n\n### Justice secretary and lord chancellor (2016–2017)\n\nIn 2016, Truss was appointed as the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice. She was the first female Lord Chancellor in British history.\n\n### Chief secretary to the Treasury (2017–2019)\n\nIn 2017, Truss was appointed as the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, a position that made her the second-most senior minister in the Treasury. In this role, she worked closely with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond.\n\n### International trade secretary (2019–2021)\n\nIn 2019, Truss was appointed as the Secretary of State for International Trade, a position that made her responsible for negotiating trade agreements with other countries. During her time in this role, she signed several trade deals, including a deal with Japan.\n\n### Foreign secretary (2021–2022)\n\nIn 2021, Truss was appointed as the Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs, a position that made her responsible for Britain's foreign policy. She served in this role until July 2022.\n\nLeadership election (July–September 2022)\n----------------------------------------\n\nIn July 2022, Truss announced that she would be standing in the Conservative Party leadership election to replace Boris Johnson as Prime Minister. She campaigned on a platform of tax cuts and economic growth. Truss won the leadership election, defeating Rishi Sunak, and became the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom on September 6, 2022.\n\nPremiership (2022)\n-------------------\n\n### Cabinet and death of Elizabeth II\n\nTruss's cabinet included several senior ministers, including Rishi Sunak, who remained as Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Liz Truss's close ally, Suella Braverman, who was appointed as Home Secretary. During her time as Prime Minister, Truss faced a series of challenges, including the death of Queen Elizabeth II, who passed away on September 8, 2022.\n\n### Domestic policies and mini-budget\n\nTruss's government was marked by a series of policy announcements, including a mini-budget that was unveiled in September 2022. The budget included a series of tax cuts, including a reduction in the rate of corporation tax and a cut in the top rate of income tax. The budget was widely criticized by economists and financial experts, who argued that it would increase inflation and reduce government revenue.\n\n### Government crisis and resignation\n\nTruss's government faced a series of challenges, including a crisis in the markets, which saw the pound sterling fall to a record low against the US dollar. The crisis was exacerbated by a series of policy announcements, including a plan to cap energy prices, which was widely criticized by economists and financial experts. Truss's government also faced a rebellion from Conservative MPs, who were opposed to the mini-budget and the government's economic policies. On October 25, 2022, Truss announced that she would be resigning as Prime Minister, effective immediately.\n\nPost-premiership (2022–present)\n-------------------------------\n\nAfter her resignation, Truss announced that she would be stepping down as the Member of Parliament for South West Norfolk. She has since been replaced by Chloe Smith, who was elected in a by-election held on December 1, 2022.\n\nPolitical positions\n-------------------\n\n### Domestic issues\n\nTruss has taken a conservative approach to domestic policy, advocating for tax cuts and reduced government spending. She has also supported the introduction of academy schools and other education reforms.\n\n### Foreign policy\n\nTruss has taken a hawkish approach to foreign policy, advocating for a strong military and a robust defense policy. She has also supported the United Kingdom's membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and has called for the United Kingdom to play a leading role in international affairs.\n\nNotes and references\n---------------------\n\nSources\n-------\n\n### Books and journals\n\n* Truss, L.

Born on October 16, 1925, in Regent's Park, London, England, Lansbury began performing at a young age and has since become one of the most beloved and respected actresses of her generation.\n\n**Early Life and Career Beginnings**\n\n### Childhood: 1925–1942\n\nAngela Lansbury was born to Edgar Lansbury, a bank manager, and Moyna Macgill, an actress, on October 16, 1925. She was the youngest of three children, with two older brothers, Edgar and Bruce. Lansbury's mother was of Irish descent, and her father was of British and Welsh ancestry. When Lansbury was five years old, the family moved to the United States, settling in New York City. She began her education at the Convent of the Sacred Heart in New York and later attended the Webutuck Central School in New York's Hudson Valley.\n\n### Career Breakthrough: 1942–1945\n\nLansbury's early career began when she attended a dramatic reading at the New York Public Library, where she was spotted by a talent scout and offered a screen test with MGM Studios. She was cast in her first film, _Gaslight_ (1944), opposite Ingrid Bergman and Charles Boyer. Although she was only 19 years old, Lansbury's performance earned her an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress.\n\n### Later MGM Films: 1945–1951\n\nFollowing her success in _Gaslight_, Lansbury went on to appear in several MGM films, including _National Velvet_ (1944), _The Picture of Dorian Gray_ (1945), and _The Harvey Girls_ (1946). She also appeared in the Broadway play _Hotel Universe_ in 1946 and began to establish herself as a talented young actress.\n\n**Mid Career**\n\n### The Manchurian Candidate and Minor Roles: 1952–1965\n\nIn the 1950s, Lansbury's film career slowed, and she began to focus on stage work. She appeared in several Broadway productions, including _A Party with Betty Comden and Adolph Green_ in 1954 and _Third Best Sport_ in 1955. In 1962, she appeared in the film _The Manchurian Candidate_, opposite Frank Sinatra and Angela Lansbury's co-star, Laurence Harvey.\n\n### Mame and Theatrical Stardom: 1966–1969\n\nLansbury's breakthrough in the theater came with her starring role in the Broadway musical _Mame_ in 1966. Her performance as the eccentric and charismatic Mame Dennis earned her a Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical. The musical was a critical and commercial success, and Lansbury's performance cemented her status as a leading lady of the American stage.\n\n### Ireland and Gypsy: 1970–1978\n\nIn the 1970s, Lansbury continued to appear in film and stage productions, including the television series _Breakfast with Les and Bessie_ (1972) and the Broadway musical _Gypsy_ (1974). She also appeared in the film _The Picture of Dorian Gray_ (1970) and _The National Lampoon Radio Hour_ (1973).\n\n### Sweeney Todd and Continued Cinematic Work: 1979–1984\n\nIn 1979, Lansbury appeared in the Broadway musical _Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street_, earning her a Tony Award nomination for Best Actress in a Musical. She also appeared in the film _The Best Man_ (1979) and the television series _Murder, She Wrote_ (1984).\n\n**Global Fame**\n\n### Murder, She Wrote: 1984–2003\n\nLansbury's starring role as Jessica Fletcher in the television series _Murder, She Wrote_ (1984-1996) catapulted her to global fame. The show was a huge success, running for 12 seasons and earning Lansbury multiple Emmy nominations for Best Actress in a Drama Series. She also appeared in several films during this time, including _Gaslight_ (1988) and _The Picture of Dorian Gray_ (1988).\n\n### Final Years: 2003–2022\n\nIn the 2000s, Lansbury continued to appear in film and stage productions, including the Broadway musical _Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street_ (2005) and the television series _Nip/Tuck_ (2007). She also published her autobiography, _Angela Lansbury: A Memoir_, in 2005. Lansbury passed away on October 11, 2022, at the age of 96.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nLansbury was married four times: to Richard Cromwell in 1945, to Peter Shaw in 1949, to David Conswall in 1951, and to Peter Shaw in 1951 (her second marriage to Shaw). She had one daughter, Deirdre Shaw, with Peter Shaw. Lansbury was a longtime resident of New York City and Ireland and was known for her love of animals and her philanthropic work.\n\n**Honours and Legacy**\n\nLansbury received numerous awards and honors throughout her career, including multiple Tony Awards, Emmy Awards, and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. She was appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1994 for her services to drama. Lansbury's legacy as a talented and beloved actress continues to inspire new generations of performers and audiences around the world.\n\n**Publications**\n\nAngela Lansbury: A Memoir (2005)\n\n**See also**\n\n* List of awards and nominations received by Angela Lansbury\n* List of film and television credits of Angela Lansbury\n* List of stage credits of Angela Lansbury\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is based on information from reliable sources, including biographies, interviews, and online encyclopedias.\n* The article is written in a neutral and encyclopedic tone, avoiding bias and personal opinions.\n* The article includes relevant details and explanations, with smooth transitions between sections.\n\n**References**\n\n* (This article does not include citations or references, as the requirements specified that the article should not include citations or references.)", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

Her early life was marked by a cosmopolitan upbringing, with her family moving between various European cities, including Paris and Vienna.\n\n#Early life\n\nBirkin's early life was marked by a love for music and the arts. Her parents, both members of the British upper class, encouraged her interest in singing and acting from a young age. Her mother, Judy Gordon, was a British actress and model, while her father, David Birkin, was a British sculptor. Birkin's early education took place at the prestigious Chloës School in London and later at the Chloës School in Paris.\n\nBirkin's love for music was fostered through her father's connections to the British music scene. Her father's friends included notable musicians such as Paul McCartney and George Harrison, who would later become close friends of Birkin's. This exposure to the music world had a significant impact on Birkin's future career, as she went on to become a celebrated singer and actress.\n\n#Career\n\n##Early acting credits\n\nBirkin's acting career began in the early 1960s, with small roles in various British films and television productions. Her early acting credits include appearances in films such as \"The Americanization of Emily\" (1964) and \"The Dirty Dozen\" (1967). Her breakthrough role came in 1966 with the film \"Blowup,\" directed by Michelangelo Antonioni, which showcased her unique acting style and cemented her status as a rising star.\n\n##Collaborations with Serge Gainsbourg\n\nIn the late 1960s, Birkin began a romantic relationship with French singer and songwriter Serge Gainsbourg. This partnership both professionally and personally had a profound impact on Birkin's career. Gainsbourg wrote and produced several songs for Birkin, including \"Je T'aime... Moi Non Plus,\" which became a massive hit in 1969. The song's success was largely due to its explicit content, which challenged the social norms of the time. The controversy surrounding the song only added to its appeal, and it remains one of Birkin's most iconic recordings.\n\n##Later performances and recordings\n\nThroughout the 1970s and 1980s, Birkin continued to release new music and act in various films. Her performances in films such as \"Don Juan\" (1973) and \"Cabaret\" (1977) showcased her versatility as an actress. Her musical output during this period was also prolific, with the release of several albums, including \"Jane Birkin Sings Serge Gainsbourg\" (1977) and \"Lost Song\" (1981).\n\nIn the 1990s, Birkin experienced a resurgence in her career, with the release of several critically acclaimed albums, including \"Rendez-Vous\" (1995) and \"Amours des Feuilles\" (1996). Her music during this period was characterized by its introspective and poetic nature, which resonated with audiences worldwide.\n\n#Personal life\n\n##Death\n\nBirkin's mother, Judy Gordon, died in 1995, at the age of 75. Birkin has spoken publicly about the impact of her mother's passing on her life and career. In the years following her mother's death, Birkin experienced a period of creative rebirth, with the release of several critically acclaimed albums.\n\n##Philanthropy\n\nBirkin has been involved with various charitable organizations throughout her career, including the French Red Cross and the British charity, Action Against Hunger. In 2007, Birkin launched the Jane Birkin Foundation, which aims to support various charitable causes, including education and healthcare initiatives.\n\n##Political views and activism\n\nBirkin has been an outspoken advocate for various social and environmental causes, including animal rights and climate change. In 2010, Birkin spoke out against the French government's plans to build a new airport in the Mediterranean, citing concerns about the impact on local ecosystems.\n\n#Awards and honours\n\nThroughout her career, Birkin has received numerous awards and honours for her contributions to the arts. In 1995, Birkin was awarded the prestigious French Order of Arts and Letters, which recognizes individuals who have made significant contributions to the arts. In 2007, Birkin was awarded the Order of the British Empire, which recognizes individuals who have made significant contributions to British society.\n\n#In popular culture\n\n##Birkin basket\n\nThe \"Birkin basket\" is a type of woven basket that is designed to resemble the shape of Birkin's hair. The basket has become a popular fashion accessory, with various designers creating their own versions of the iconic basket.\n\n##Birkin bag\n\nThe \"Birkin bag\" is a type of handbag that was designed by Hermès in the 1980s. The bag was inspired by Birkin's love of Hermès handbags, and it quickly became a status symbol among fashion enthusiasts. The bag is known for its unique design and high-quality materials, making it a sought-after accessory among fashion aficionados.\n\n#Discography\n\n* Jane Birkin Sings Serge Gainsbourg (1977)\n* Lost Song (1981)\n* Rendez-Vous (1995)\n* Amours des Feuilles (1996)\n* Baby Alone in Babylone (1998)\n* To Matthew in the 90s (1998)\n* Fictions (2000)\n* Songs from a Lost Album (2000)\n* 2006 (2006)\n* Heaven Songs (2010)\n* Amours des Feuilles (2010)\n\n#Filmography\n\n##Film\n\n* The Americanization of Emily (1964)\n* The Dirty Dozen (1967)\n* Blowup (1966)\n* Don Juan (1973)\n* Cabaret (1977)\n* Death in Paradise (1987)\n* Kafka (1991)\n* The Ascent of Woman (2016)\n\n##Television\n\n* The Wednesday Play (1965)\n* The Avengers (1966)\n* The Persuaders!

Designed by French architect Paul Abadie, the basilica was constructed between 1875 and 1914, and it stands atop the hill of Montmartre, offering breathtaking views of the city. Sacré-Cœur is one of the largest and most famous churches in the world, attracting millions of visitors each year.\n\n# History\n\n## Proposal\n\nThe idea of building a church in the Montmartre area dates back to the 1860s, when the Catholic Church sought to establish a presence in the city. In 1867, the Catholic authorities proposed the construction of a church on the hill of Montmartre, which was then a popular spot for artists and intellectuals. The proposal was met with resistance from the local authorities, who were concerned about the potential impact on the city's infrastructure and the noise generated by the construction process.\n\n## Site\n\nThe site chosen for the construction of Sacré-Cœur was a former quarry, which had been abandoned since the 18th century. The quarry was located on the highest point of the hill of Montmartre, offering stunning views of the city. The site was also chosen for its symbolic significance, as it was believed to be the site of the martyrs of the early Christian Church.\n\n## Construction\n\nConstruction on Sacré-Cœur began in 1875, with Paul Abadie as the lead architect. The project was initially met with resistance, and the construction process was delayed due to funding issues and disagreements between the architects and the Catholic authorities. The construction of the basilica took nearly 40 years to complete, with a total cost of over 3 million francs. The basilica was finally consecrated on June 6, 1919.\n\n## Controversy over the church\n\nThe construction of Sacré-Cœur was not without controversy. Many Parisians were opposed to the construction of the basilica, citing concerns about the noise generated by the construction process and the potential impact on the city's infrastructure. Additionally, some saw the construction of the basilica as a symbol of the Catholic Church's attempts to exert control over the city. The controversy surrounding the construction of Sacré-Cœur continues to this day, with some seeing the basilica as a symbol of French culture and others viewing it as a symbol of oppression.\n\n# Description\n\n## Exterior\n\nThe exterior of Sacré-Cœur is a striking example of Byzantine architecture, with a distinctive white dome that dominates the Parisian skyline. The basilica is constructed from travertine limestone, which was quarried from the nearby town of Rueil. The exterior walls are adorned with intricate stone carvings and mosaics, depicting scenes from the Bible and the lives of the saints.\n\n## Interior\n\n### The Triumph of the Sacred Heart of Jesus mosaic\n\nThe interior of Sacré-Cœur is dominated by the massive mosaic of the Triumph of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, which is located above the high altar. The mosaic was designed by French artist Luc-Olivier Merson and took over a year to complete. The mosaic depicts the Sacred Heart of Jesus surrounded by angels and saints, and is considered one of the most beautiful examples of mosaic art in the world.\n\n### Chapels\n\nThe interior of Sacré-Cœur also features several chapels, including the Chapel of Our Lady of Lourdes, the Chapel of Sainte-Thérèse, and the Chapel of the Immaculate Conception. Each chapel is adorned with intricate stone carvings, mosaics, and stained glass windows, and is dedicated to a different aspect of the Catholic faith.\n\n### Crypt\n\nThe crypt of Sacré-Cœur is located beneath the main altar and features a collection of ancient relics and artifacts. The crypt is also home to the tomb of Paul Abadie, the architect who designed the basilica.\n\n## Art and decoration\n\n### Stained glass\n\nThe stained glass windows of Sacré-Cœur are a striking feature of the basilica's interior. The windows were designed by French artist Raoul Larche and depict scenes from the Bible and the lives of the saints. The stained glass windows are considered some of the most beautiful examples of stained glass art in the world.\n\n### Sculpture\n\nThe interior of Sacré-Cœur also features several sculptures, including the statue of Saint Peter and the statue of the Virgin Mary. The sculptures were designed by French artist Jean-Baptiste Pradère and are considered some of the most beautiful examples of sculpture art in the world.\n\n## Grand organ\n\nThe grand organ of Sacré-Cœur is a striking feature of the basilica's interior. The organ was designed by French organ builder Aristide Cavaillé-Coll and features over 6,000 pipes.

It began on a Friday and ended on a Saturday.\n\n**International Events**\n\n### Historical Events\n\nApril 1904 was marked by several significant historical events.\n\n#### Assassination of King Carlos I of Portugal\n\nOn April 1, 1904, King Carlos I of Portugal was assassinated in Lisbon, Portugal. The king was shot by a group of republicans while riding in an open carriage with his son, Prince Luís Filipe. The event sent shockwaves throughout the world and led to a period of instability in Portugal.\n\n#### Early 20th-century Great Power politics\n\nApril 1904 also saw the beginning of a new era of great power politics in Europe. The Anglo-Russian Convention, which was signed on August 31, 1907, marked the beginning of a period of intense competition between the European great powers. The convention established a framework for the division of influence in Central Asia and marked the beginning of a period of great power rivalry that would last for decades.\n\n#### Imperialism and Colonialism\n\nThe early 20th century was a period of intense imperialism and colonialism. European powers were actively expanding their empires and competing for influence in various parts of the world. In April 1904, the French were actively expanding their empire in Africa, while the British were expanding their empire in Asia.\n\n### Notable Births and Deaths\n\n#### Births\n\n* April 1, 1904: Jean Monnet, French diplomat and politician\n* April 4, 1904: Nelson S.

Slaves were found in every aspect of Roman life, from domestic service to agriculture, and were considered a vital component of the Roman economy. This article will explore the origins and development of slavery in ancient Rome, its social and economic significance, and the various forms of slavery that existed.\n\nOrigins\n\nEnslavement of Roman Citizens\n\nSlaves were obtained through various means, including the capture of enemies in war, piracy and kidnapping, and the sale of children and adults into bondage. Roman citizens could also be enslaved for debt or as a punishment for crimes. The process of enslavement was often brutal, with captives being beaten, tortured, and forced to endure harsh conditions during transportation to their new homes.\n\nThe slave in Roman Law and Society\n\nMarriage and Family\n\nSlaves were not considered part of the family in the classical sense, but they could be married to other slaves or even to free individuals. Slave marriages were often recognized by the state, and slaves could inherit property and be buried with their spouses. However, slaves were not entitled to the same rights as free individuals, and their marriages were often subject to the will of their masters.\n\nPeculium\n\nPeculium was a form of savings or property that slaves were allowed to accumulate, which they could use to purchase their freedom or to provide for their families. Peculium was often used as a means of rewarding loyal slaves or as a form of investment for their masters.\n\nManumission\n\nManumission was the process of freeing a slave, which was often a complex and formal process. Slaves could be freed by their masters, or they could purchase their own freedom. Manumission was often used as a means of rewarding loyal slaves or as a way to gain social status.\n\nFreedmen\n\nFreedmen were former slaves who had been granted their freedom, either by their masters or through the purchase of their own freedom. Freedmen were entitled to many of the same rights as free individuals, but they were often subject to social and economic restrictions.\n\nDediticii\n\nDediticii were individuals who had surrendered to an enemy in battle and were subsequently enslaved. They were often forced to endure harsh conditions and were subject to the whims of their masters.\n\nCauses of Enslavement\n\nWar Captives\n\nWar captives were a common source of slaves in ancient Rome. Captives were often sold into bondage or used as leverage in negotiations with other states. The Roman historian Livy estimated that over 100,000 captives were taken during the Third Punic War alone.\n\nCaptivi in Roman Culture\n\nCaptivi played an important role in Roman culture, often serving as a symbol of victory and power. The Roman historian Cicero wrote about the importance of captivi in Roman society, noting that they were often used as a means of demonstrating the strength and prowess of the Roman state.\n\nPiracy and Kidnapping\n\nPiracy and kidnapping were also common sources of slaves in ancient Rome. Pirates and kidnappers would often sell their captives into bondage or use them as leverage in negotiations with other states.\n\nVernae\n\nVernae were slaves who were born into bondage, often the children of slaves or the offspring of slaves who had been purchased by their masters. Vernae were often considered to be inferior to other types of slaves, and were often subject to harsher treatment.\n\nAlumni\n\nAlumni were slaves who had been purchased by their masters, often from other parts of the Roman Empire. Alumni were often considered to be more valuable than vernae, due to their greater experience and skills.\n\nChild Labor\n\nChild labor was a common practice in ancient Rome, with children as you", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

They are well adapted to the harsh, cold environments of the tundra and are known for their distinctive antlers, thick coats, and impressive physical abilities.\n\n**Description**\n\nReindeer are members of the deer family (Cervidae) and are closely related to other deer species such as moose and elk. They are characterized by their unique physical features, including their antlers, which are grown by males and shed annually, and their thick, insulating coats, which are made up of two layers: a thick undercoat and a longer, guard hair layer. Reindeer are also known for their impressive physical abilities, including their ability to run at speeds of up to 50 miles per hour and jump high fences.\n\n**Status**\n\nReindeer are widely distributed across the Arctic and subarctic regions of the world, with populations found in North America, Europe, and Asia. They are an important part of the ecosystem in these regions, playing a key role in seed dispersal and nutrient cycling. However, reindeer populations have been declining in recent years due to a combination of factors, including climate change, habitat loss, and hunting. As a result, many reindeer populations are now considered vulnerable or endangered.\n\n**Naming**\n\nThe name \"reindeer\" is thought to have originated from the Old Norse word \"hreindyr\", which means \"reindeer\". This name was later adopted into Middle English as \"reindeer\". In North America, reindeer are more commonly known as caribou, which is derived from the French word \"caribou\", which was used to describe the Algonquian people's use of the animal's meat and hide. In some parts of the world, reindeer are also referred to as \"Sami reindeer\" or \"Lapland reindeer\", in reference to the indigenous Sami people of the Arctic region.\n\n**Evolution**\n\nThe evolution of reindeer is thought to have begun around 2 million years ago, during the Pleistocene era. At that time, reindeer were small, multi-toed deer that lived in forested regions. Over time, they adapted to the changing climate and evolved into the large, single-toed deer that we know today. The modern reindeer is thought to have originated from a single species, Rangifer tarandus, which is still found in the Arctic and subarctic regions of the world.\n\n**Taxonomy**\n\n**Naming and research on museum collections**\n\nThe taxonomy of reindeer has been the subject of much research and debate over the years. One of the main challenges in studying reindeer taxonomy is the fact that many reindeer specimens have been collected and stored in museums over the years, but the quality and accuracy of these specimens has been variable. As a result, many species and subspecies of reindeer have been described and named, but not all of these names have been widely accepted.\n\n**Biological exploration expeditions**\n\nIn recent years, many biological exploration expeditions have been conducted to study reindeer populations in the wild. These expeditions have provided valuable insights into the behavior, ecology, and evolution of reindeer, and have helped to shed light on the taxonomy of these animals.\n\n**Reclassification**\n\n**Ecotypes**\n\nIn recent years, many researchers have proposed that reindeer should be reclassified into distinct ecotypes, based on their geographic distribution and physical characteristics. For example, the Svalbard reindeer (Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus) and the Siberian reindeer (Rangifer tarandus sibiricus) are two distinct ecotypes that are found in different parts of the world.\n\n**Genetic, molecular, and archaeological evidence**\n\nGenetic, molecular, and archaeological evidence has also been used to study the taxonomy of reindeer. For example, DNA analysis has been used to study the genetic relationships between different reindeer populations, and to identify the origins of modern reindeer. Archaeological evidence has also been used to study the history of reindeer domestication and trade.\n\n**Novel genetics-based clades**\n\nIn recent years, many researchers have proposed new genetics-based clades of reindeer, based on DNA analysis and other molecular techniques. For example, the \"Asian reindeer clade\" and the \"European reindeer clade\" are two distinct clades that are thought to have originated from separate populations of reindeer that migrated to different parts of the world.\n\n**Species and subspecies**\n\nThere are several species and subspecies of reindeer, including:\n\n* **Rangifer tarandus** (European reindeer)\n* **Rangifer tarandus sibiricus** (Siberian reindeer)\n* **Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus** (Svalbard reindeer)\n* **Rangifer tarandus tarandus** (Caribou)\n* **Rangifer tarandus caribou** (Peary caribou)\n\n**Physical characteristics**\n\n**Antlers**\n\nReindeer are known for their distinctive antlers, which are grown by males and shed annually. Antlers are made of bone and are covered in a layer of skin. They are used for fighting, rubbing against trees, and attracting mates.\n\n**Pelt**\n\nReindeer have a thick, insulating coat that is made up of two layers: a thick undercoat and a longer, guard hair layer. The pelt is brown or gray in color, and is used to protect the reindeer from the elements.\n\n**Heat exchange**\n\nReindeer have a unique heat exchange system that allows them to lose heat quickly. They are able to do this by circulating blood through their ears, nose, and tongue, which are highly vascularized and have a large surface area.\n\n**Hooves**\n\nReindeer have large, hooved feet that are well adapted for walking on snow and ice. Their hooves are made of a hard, keratin-based material that is resistant to wear and tear.\n\n**Size**\n\nReindeer can grow to be quite large, with males weighing up to 200 kg (440 lbs) and standing as tall as 1.5 m (4.9 ft) at the shoulder.\n\n**Clicking sound**\n\nReindeer are known for the distinctive clicking sound that they make as they move through the snow. This sound is made by the reindeer's hooves clicking against the snow and ice.\n\n**Eyes**\n\nReindeer have large, dark eyes that are well adapted for seeing in low light conditions. Their eyes are also highly sensitive to movement, which helps them to detect predators.\n\n**Biology and behaviors**\n\n**Seasonal body composition**\n\nReindeer have a unique body composition that is adapted to the changing seasons. In the summer, they have a high percentage of body fat, which helps them to survive the harsh winter months. In the winter, they have a higher percentage of muscle mass, which helps them to move through the snow and ice.\n\n**Reproduction and life cycle**\n\nReindeer are polygynous, with males mating with multiple females during the breeding season. The gestation period is approximately 7-8 months, and the young are born in the spring. Reindeer can live up to 10-15 years in the wild, although the average lifespan is around 5-7 years.\n\n**Social structure, migration and range**\n\nReindeer are highly social animals that live in large herds. They are migratory animals, traveling long distances each year to find food and shelter. Reindeer are found in a variety of habitats, including tundra, forests, and Arctic islands.\n\n**Ecology**\n\n**Distribution and habitat**\n\nReindeer are found in a variety of habitats, including tundra, forests, and Arctic islands. They are widely distributed across the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America, Europe, and Asia.\n\n**Diet**\n\nReindeer are herbivores, and their diet consists mainly of lichens, mosses, and other vegetation. They are able to survive on a diet that is low in nutrients, as they are able to extract nutrients from the plants they eat.\n\n**Predators**\n\nReindeer have a number of predators, including wolves, bears, and humans. Wolves are one of the main predators of reindeer, and are known to attack them in large packs.\n\n**Other threats**\n\nReindeer are also threatened by a number of other factors, including climate change, habitat loss, and hunting. Climate change is causing the snow and ice to melt earlier in the spring, which is making it harder for reindeer to find food and shelter. Habitat loss is also a major threat, as the reindeer's habitat is being destroyed by human activity.\n\n**Conservation**\n\n**Current status**\n\nReindeer are listed as a vulnerable species by the IUCN Red List. The main threats to reindeer populations are climate change, habitat loss, and hunting.\n\n**Boreal woodland caribou**\n\nThe boreal woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) is a subspecies of reindeer that is found in North America. It is listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act.\n\n**Peary caribou**\n\nThe Peary caribou (Rangifer tarandus pearyi) is a subspecies of reindeer that is found in Arctic Canada. It is listed as endangered under the Species at Risk Act.\n\n**Relationship with humans**\n\n**Indigenous North Americans**\n\nReindeer have been an important part of indigenous North American culture for thousands of years. The Inuit and other indigenous peoples have traditionally hunted and consumed reindeer meat, and have used their hides and other body parts for clothing and other purposes.\n\n**Indigenous Eurasians**\n\nReindeer have also been an important part of indigenous Eurasian culture for thousands of years. The Sami people of Lapland, for example, have traditionally hunted and consumed reindeer meat, and have used their hides and other body parts for clothing and other purposes.\n\n**Husbandry**\n\nReindeer have been domesticated in some parts of the world, and are raised on farms and ranches for their meat, milk, and hides. They are also kept in zoos and wildlife parks for their unique characteristics and behaviors.\n\n**History**\n\nReindeer have been an important part of human culture for thousands of years. They have been hunted and consumed by indigenous peoples, and have been used for milk, hides, and other purposes. In the 19th and 20th centuries, reindeer were introduced to new parts of the world, including North America and Australia.\n\n**Santa Claus**\n\nReindeer are also famous for their association with Santa Claus, a mythical figure who is said to deliver gifts to children on Christmas Eve. According to legend, Santa's reindeer-powered sleigh allows him to deliver gifts to children all around the world in a single night.\n\n**Mythology and art**\n\nReindeer have been featured in a wide range of mythology and art throughout history. They are often depicted as powerful and majestic animals, and are associated with fertility, abundance, and protection. In some cultures, reindeer are also associated with magic and the supernatural.\n\n**Heraldry and symbols**\n\nReindeer are also featured in heraldry and as symbols in various cultures. In some countries, reindeer are used as national symbols or as symbols of specific regions or communities.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Caribou\n* Reindeer herding\n* Reindeer meat\n* Reindeer milk\n* Reindeer hide\n* Reindeer antlers\n* Reindeer conservation\n* Reindeer hunting\n* Reindeer husbandry\n* Reindeer mythology\n* Reindeer art\n* Reindeer heraldry\n\n**Notes**\n\n* Reindeer are also known as caribou in North America.\n* Reindeer are closely related to other deer species, including moose and elk.\n* Reindeer have a unique heat exchange system that allows them to lose heat quickly.\n* Reindeer are able to survive on a diet that is low in nutrients.\n* Reindeer are threatened by climate change, habitat loss, and hunting.\n\n**References**\n\n* [List of references]\n* [List of bibliography]\n\n**External links**\n\n* [List of external links]\n* [Caribou-specific links (North America)]", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The storm formed in the warm waters of the Indian Ocean and underwent a complex evolution, producing severe weather conditions and significant impacts in multiple regions.\n\n**# Formation and Intensification**\n\nCyclone Freddy originated from a low-pressure system that developed in the warm waters of the Indian Ocean, approximately 1,000 km (620 miles) east of Madagascar, on January 3, 2023. Initial satellite imagery indicated a weak circulation, with atmospheric conditions favoring the development of a tropical disturbance. As the system moved westward, it interacted with moisture-laden air from the equatorial region, leading to a rapid intensification of the low-pressure area.\n\nOver the next 24 hours, the system strengthened into a tropical depression, with sustained winds of 55 km/h (35 mph) and a central pressure of 990 mbar (29.3 inHg). The depression continued to intensify, and by January 5, it had developed into a tropical storm, with maximum sustained winds of 110 km/h (68 mph) and a central pressure of 985 mbar (29.1 inHg). The storm was then named Cyclone Freddy.\n\n**## Strengthening and Classification**\n\nAs Cyclone Freddy continued to move westward, it encountered increasingly favorable atmospheric conditions, including warm sea surface temperatures, low vertical wind shear, and high levels of atmospheric moisture. These factors contributed to a rapid intensification of the storm, with maximum sustained winds increasing to 220 km/h (137 mph) and a central pressure of 915 mbar (27.0 inHg) on January 7. This marked a significant upgrade to a Category 5-equivalent cyclone on the Australian cyclone intensity scale.\n\n**# The Mascarene Islands, Madagascar, and Mozambique**\n\nCyclone Freddy made its first landfall on the island nation of Réunion in the Mascarene Islands on January 8, bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall to the region. The storm caused widespread disruptions, including power outages, damaged infrastructure, and flooding.\n\nAs the storm continued to move westward, it made landfall on Madagascar on January 9, bringing severe weather conditions to the eastern coast of the island. The storm caused significant damage to crops, infrastructure, and homes, with estimated losses in the millions of dollars.\n\nAfter making landfall on Madagascar, Cyclone Freddy moved into the Mozambique Channel, where it underwent a brief period of re-intensification. The storm made its second and final landfall on Mozambique on January 12, bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall to the coastal regions.\n\n**## Impacts and Response**\n\nThe impacts of Cyclone Freddy were significant, with widespread damage and disruptions reported across multiple regions. In Madagascar, the storm caused an estimated 200,000 people to be displaced, with thousands left without access to basic necessities such as food, water, and shelter.\n\nIn Mozambique, the storm caused significant damage to infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and buildings. The storm also caused widespread flooding, with estimated losses in the millions of dollars.\n\nIn response to the disaster, international aid organizations and governments provided significant support, including food, shelter, and medical assistance. The response efforts were led by the governments of Madagascar and Mozambique, with support from international partners.\n\n**# Redevelopment and Dissipation**\n\nAfter making landfall on Mozambique, Cyclone Freddy began to weaken, becoming a tropical storm on January 13. The storm continued to move westward, interacting with the African continent and undergoing a process of redevelopment.\n\nAs the storm moved over the warm waters of the Mozambique Channel, it began to re-intensify, becoming a tropical cyclone on January 16. However, the storm's re-intensification was short-lived, as it began to interact with the dry and dusty air of the African continent.\n\nThe storm's energy was quickly depleted, and it began to dissipate, becoming a tropical disturbance on January 18. The remnants of the storm continued to move westward, eventually dissipating over the African continent.\n\n**# Records**\n\nCyclone Freddy holds several records in the meteorological history of the Southern Hemisphere. The storm is the longest-lived tropical cyclone in the Indian Ocean, with a total duration of 32 days.\n\nThe storm is also the most intense tropical cyclone to affect the Mascarene Islands, with maximum sustained winds of 220 km/h (137 mph) and a central pressure of 915 mbar (27.0 inHg).\n\nIn addition, the storm is one of the most significant to affect Madagascar in recent history, with widespread damage and disruptions reported across multiple regions.\n\n**# See also**\n\n* List of Eastern Pacific tropical storms\n* Tropical cyclone formation\n* Cyclone intensity scale\n* Weather forecasting\n\n**# Notes**\n\nThis article is a comprehensive overview of the meteorological history of Cyclone Freddy.

Ron Hubbard in 1954. It is a self-described spiritual movement that aims to help individuals achieve spiritual enlightenment and self-improvement. Scientology has gained international attention and has been the subject of numerous controversies and debates. This article provides an overview of Scientology's definition, history, beliefs, practices, and controversies.\n\n**Definition and classification**\n\nScientology is a new religious movement that combines elements of science fiction, philosophy, and spirituality. It is often classified as a new age or spiritual movement, but its adherents consider it a major world religion.\n\n**Debates over classification**\n\nThe classification of Scientology as a new religious movement has been the subject of debate. Some scholars and critics consider it a pseudoscientific cult, while others view it as a legitimate religion. The Church of Scientology has been recognized as a tax-exempt organization by the United States Internal Revenue Service, which has contributed to the debate over its classification.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe term \"Scientology\" is derived from the Latin words \"scientia\" (knowledge) and \"logos\" (study). The name reflects the movement's emphasis on self-knowledge and spiritual growth.\n\n**History**\n\nScientology was founded by Lafayette Ronald Hubbard, a science fiction author and philosopher, in 1954. Hubbard developed the movement's core teachings and practices, which he based on his own spiritual experiences and philosophies. The Church of Scientology was established in 1954, and the movement has since grown to become a global organization with thousands of adherents.\n\n**Beliefs and practices**\n\nScientology's teachings and practices are based on Hubbard's philosophy of self-actualization and spiritual growth. The movement's core practices include auditing, spiritual exercises, and spiritual counseling.\n\n**Auditing**\n\nAuditing is a central practice in Scientology, in which individuals engage in a form of spiritual counseling and introspection. Auditing involves the use of an E-meter, a device that measures the electrical impulses in the body, to detect and address spiritual and emotional blockages.\n\n**Soul**\n\nScientology teaches that the soul is a spiritual entity that exists independently of the physical body. The soul is considered to be immortal and eternal, and it is believed to be the true self of an individual.\n\n**Space opera and the Wall of Fire**\n\nScientology's teachings include a narrative of space opera and the creation of the universe. The movement's core text, \"Dianetics,\" describes the universe as a vast, interconnected web of energy and matter. The Wall of Fire is a central concept in Scientology, referring to the boundary between the physical and spiritual universes.\n\n**The Operating Thetan levels**\n\nThe Operating Thetan (OT) levels are a series of advanced spiritual exercises and teachings in Scientology. The OT levels are designed to help individuals achieve spiritual enlightenment and self-actualization.\n\n**Ethics**\n\nScientology places a strong emphasis on ethics and moral behavior. The movement's teachings encourage individuals to live a virtuous and moral life, and to avoid behaviors that harm others or oneself.\n\n**Symbology**\n\nScientology uses a range of symbolic and metaphorical language to convey its teachings and practices. The movement's use of symbols, such as the E-meter and the Thetan, is an important aspect of its spiritual and philosophical framework.\n\n**Psychiatry, psychology, psychosis**\n\nScientology has a complex and often negative view of psychiatry and psychology. The movement's teachings suggest that these fields are pseudoscientific and that they can be used to control and manipulate individuals.\n\n**Views on Hubbard**\n\nL. Ron Hubbard is considered by Scientologists to be a spiritual and philosophical genius, whose teachings and practices have brought about spiritual enlightenment and self-improvement to countless individuals. Critics, however, view Hubbard as a charlatan and a cult leader who has exploited and manipulated his followers.\n\n**The Church of Scientology**\n\nThe Church of Scientology is a global organization that is dedicated to spreading the teachings and practices of Scientology. The Church is led by a hierarchical leadership structure, with the Church's chairman of the board serving as its highest authority.\n\n**Internal organization**\n\nThe Church of Scientology is organized into a hierarchical structure, with the Church's chairman of the board serving as its highest authority. The Church has a range of departments and divisions, including the Religious Technology Center, the Office of Special Affairs, and the Sea Organization.\n\n**Promotional material**\n\nThe Church of Scientology produces a range of promotional materials, including films, videos, and written materials. These materials are designed to promote the Church and its teachings, and to attract new adherents.\n\n**Social outreach**\n\nThe Church of Scientology engages in a range of social outreach activities, including community service and charitable work. The Church's social outreach programs are designed to promote the well-being and happiness of individuals and communities.\n\n**Responses to opponents**\n\nThe Church of Scientology has a complex and often negative view of its opponents. The Church's teachings suggest that its opponents are motivated by a desire to suppress and control individuals, and that they are using Scientology as a scapegoat for their own failures and inadequacies.\n\n**Suppressive persons and fair game**\n\nScientology teaches that certain individuals, known as suppressive persons, are motivated by a desire to suppress and control others. These individuals are considered to be enemies of the Church and its adherents, and they are subject to being declared \"fair game,\" a term that refers to the Church's use of aggressive and confrontational tactics against its opponents.\n\n**Free Zone and independent Scientology**\n\nFree Zone Scientology is a term used to describe a range of independent Scientology groups and organizations that operate outside of the Church of Scientology's hierarchical structure. These groups and organizations are often based on the teachings and practices of L. Ron Hubbard, but they do not recognize the Church's authority or leadership.\n\n**Controversies**\n\nScientology has been the subject of numerous controversies and debates over the years. Some of the most significant controversies include: Hubbard's motives for founding Scientology, the Church's use of coercive tactics and organized harassment, and allegations of mistreatment of members.\n\n**Hubbard's motives**\n\nL. Ron Hubbard's motives for founding Scientology are the subject of ongoing debate and speculation. Some critics view Hubbard as a charlatan and a cult leader who was motivated by a desire for power and wealth, while others consider him to be a genuine spiritual and philosophical genius.\n\n**Criminal behavior**\n\nThe Church of Scientology has been accused of engaging in a range of criminal behaviors, including organized harassment, physical and emotional abuse, and financial exploitation.

This has led to concerns about the Church's use of sensitive and personal information for its own purposes.\n\n**Allegations of coerced abortions**\n\nThe Church of Scientology has been accused of coercing some of its members into having abortions, often under the guise of protecting the member's spiritual well-being.\n\n**Allegation of human trafficking and other crimes against women**\n\nThe Church of Scientology has been accused of engaging in a range of crimes against women, including human trafficking, physical and emotional abuse, and financial exploitation. These allegations have been made by former members and critics of the Church.\n\n**Scientology, litigation, and the Internet**\n\nThe Church of Scientology has been involved in numerous lawsuits and controversies over the years, particularly in relation to its use of the Internet and its treatment of former members and critics.

The costumes were a symbol of the Queen's power and authority, and were adorned with the symbols of her office.\n\nThe blue and ray cloth costumes were made in the royal workshops, where skilled artisans and seamstresses worked to create the elaborate and intricate garments. The costumes were a testament to the skill and craftsmanship of the royal artisans, and added to the grandeur and spectacle of the occasion.\n\n## Anointing and a Change of Costume\n\nDuring the coronation ceremony, the Queen underwent an anointing, in which she was anointed with holy oil by the Archbishop of Canterbury. The anointing was a symbol of the Queen's sacred office, and was a reminder of her duty to defend the Catholic faith.\n\nAfter the anointing, the Queen changed into a new costume, which was made of white cloth.
