The matches are played on July 22, 2023. The winners progress to the preliminary round, while the losers are eliminated from the competition.\n\n## Notes\n\nThe extra preliminary round is often referred to as the \"utopian dream\" for lower league teams, as it provides an opportunity for teams to progress to the next round and potentially earn a place in the first round proper.\n\n**Preliminary round**\n\nThe preliminary round is the second stage of the qualifying rounds, with 272 teams entering the competition. The matches are played on July 29, 2023.

The winners progress to the second qualifying round, while the losers are eliminated from the competition.\n\n## Upsets\n\nThe first qualifying round is often a stage where upsets occur, with lower league teams causing surprise victories against teams from higher leagues. This is often due to the relatively low stakes and the fact that many teams from higher leagues are rotating their squads.\n\n## Notes\n\nThe first qualifying round is a significant stage in the competition, as teams that progress to the next round are one step closer to earning a place in the first round proper.\n\n**Second qualifying round**\n\nThe second qualifying round is the fourth stage of the qualifying rounds, with 80 teams entering the competition. The matches are played on August 12, 2023. The winners progress to the third qualifying round, while the losers are eliminated from the competition.\n\n## Notes\n\nThe second qualifying round is a challenging stage for teams, as they face stiffer competition and higher stakes. The teams that enter this round are generally from lower leagues and are looking to cause an upset against teams from higher leagues.\n\n**Third qualifying round**\n\nThe third qualifying round is the fifth stage of the qualifying rounds, with 40 teams entering the competition. The matches are played on August 19, 2023. The winners progress to the fourth qualifying round, while the losers are eliminated from the competition.\n\n## Notes\n\nThe third qualifying round is a significant stage in the competition, as teams that progress to the next round are one step closer to earning a place in the first round proper.\n\n**Fourth qualifying round**\n\nThe fourth qualifying round is the sixth and final stage of the qualifying rounds, with 20 teams entering the competition. The matches are played on August 29, 2023. The winners earn a place in the first round proper, while the losers are eliminated from the competition.\n\n## Notes\n\nThe fourth qualifying round is the final stage of the qualifying rounds, and teams that progress to the first round proper are one step closer to competing in the main competition.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The path is a popular destination for cyclists, walkers, and joggers, and is considered one of the most scenic and accessible bike paths in the Los Angeles area.\n\n**Route**\n\nThe Ballona Creek Bike Path begins at the intersection of Lincoln Boulevard and Washington Boulevard in Culver City, and ends at the intersection of Pacific Avenue and Centinela Avenue in Los Angeles. The path follows the Ballona Creek for most of its length, passing through a variety of urban and natural landscapes, including parks, gardens, and wetlands.\n\n**Airport**\n\nOne notable feature of the Ballona Creek Bike Path is its proximity to the Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). In fact, the path passes directly beneath the airport's flight paths, providing a unique and thrilling experience for cyclists and walkers. However, this proximity also means that the path can be affected by airport noise and air pollution.\n\n**Conditions**\n\nThe Ballona Creek Bike Path is generally a well-maintained and safe path, with a smooth and wide surface suitable for cyclists of all skill levels. However, the path can be prone to flooding during heavy rainfall, and users are advised to exercise caution during periods of wet weather. Additionally, the path can be busy with pedestrians, joggers, and other users, especially on weekends and holidays.\n\n**Conditions**\n\n### Rest stops\n\nThere are several rest stops and amenities along the Ballona Creek Bike Path, including benches, picnic tables, and drinking fountains. These rest stops provide a welcome respite for users, and offer a chance to take in the scenic views and enjoy the surrounding environment.\n\n### Homeless camping\n\nUnfortunately, the Ballona Creek Bike Path has been affected by homelessness in the past, with some users reporting encounters with homeless individuals and makeshift camps. However, the City of Los Angeles and other authorities have implemented efforts to address this issue, including increased staffing and outreach services.\n\n**Access gates**\n\nThere are several access gates along the Ballona Creek Bike Path, which provide users with opportunities to enter and exit the path at various points. These gates are typically marked with signs and are easily accessible by car or on foot.\n\n**History**\n\nThe Ballona Creek Bike Path has a long and varied history, dating back to the early 20th century when the creek was first developed as a recreational area. The path was initially built as a dirt trail, but was later paved and expanded to accommodate growing demand.

The earthquakes resulted in widespread destruction, loss of life, and displacement of people in both countries.\n\n# Tectonic setting\n\n## Geology\n\nTurkey and Syria are located in a seismically active region of the Eastern Mediterranean, where the Arabian and Anatolian plates are colliding. The region is characterized by a complex geology, with various faults, folds, and basement rocks. The earthquakes occurred in the Eastern Anatolian Fault Zone, a major transform fault that runs along the eastern edge of Turkey.\n\n## Seismicity\n\nThe region has a history of significant earthquakes, with several major events occurring in the past century. The most notable ones include the 1939 Erzincan earthquake, which had a magnitude of 7.8, and the 1999 İzmit earthquake, which had a magnitude of 7.4.\n\n# Earthquake sequence\n\n## Aftershocks\n\nThe initial earthquake, which occurred on February 6, 2023, had a magnitude of 7.8 and was followed by a series of aftershocks, including a second major earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 on the same day. The aftershocks continued for several days, with many having a magnitude greater than 6.0.\n\n## Seismology\n\nThe earthquakes were caused by a combination of tectonic forces, including the movement of the Arabian plate beneath the Anatolian plate. The earthquakes were characterized by a complex rupture process, with multiple segments of the fault rupturing simultaneously.\n\n## Rupture propagation\n\nThe rupture propagation of the earthquakes was complex, with the mainshock occurring on a shallow depth of approximately 10 km. The aftershocks occurred on both shallow and deep parts of the fault, indicating a complex interaction between the fault segments.\n\n## Surface rupture\n\nThe earthquakes resulted in significant surface rupture, with the ground surface breaking and creating new faults. The rupture was observed in several areas, including the city of Kahramanmaraş, where the ground surface broke open, creating a new fault.\n\n## Ground motion\n\nThe ground motion was intense, with reports of widespread damage and collapse of buildings. The ground motion was characterized by high-frequency shaking, with the highest intensities occurring in the cities of Gaziantep and Hatay.\n\n## Geological effects\n\nThe earthquakes resulted in significant geological effects, including liquefaction, landslides, and rockfalls. The liquefaction was observed in several areas, including the city of Şanlıurfa, where the ground became saturated and caused widespread damage.\n\n## Tsunami\n\nThere were no reports of a tsunami occurring during the earthquakes. However, the earthquakes did result in a significant increase in the sea level, with reports of coastal flooding in several areas.\n\n## Effects on other faults\n\nThe earthquakes did not affect other major faults in the region, including the North Anatolian Fault Zone and the Dead Sea Transform.\n\n# Damage and casualties\n\n## In Turkey\n\nThe earthquakes resulted in significant damage and loss of life in Turkey, with reports of widespread destruction and collapse of buildings. The death toll in Turkey was estimated to be over 30,000, with many more injured.\n\n## In Syria\n\nThe earthquakes resulted in significant damage and loss of life in Syria, with reports of widespread destruction and collapse of buildings. The death toll in Syria was estimated to be over 5,000, with many more injured.\n\n## Foreign casualties\n\nThere were reports of foreign casualties, including citizens of several countries, including the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom.\n\n## Effects in other countries\n\nThe earthquakes did not have a significant impact on other countries in the region, although there were reports of minor damage and disruption to transportation.\n\n## Aftershocks\n\nThe aftershocks continued for several days, with many having a magnitude greater than 6.0.\n\n## Estimations of losses\n\nThe total losses from the earthquakes were estimated to be over $100 billion, making it one of the most expensive natural disasters in history.\n\n# Aftermath\n\n## Turkey\n\n### Search and rescue\n\nThe search and rescue efforts were led by the Turkish government, with assistance from international teams. The efforts were hampered by the difficult terrain and the extent of the damage.\n\n### Charity and volunteer campaigns\n\nThere were several charity and volunteer campaigns launched to assist the affected communities, including a major fundraising campaign led by the Turkish Red Crescent.\n\n### Government assistance\n\nThe Turkish government provided significant assistance to the affected communities, including emergency aid, shelter, and medical care.\n\n### Incidents\n\nThere were several incidents reported, including looting and clashes between protesters and security forces.\n\n### Crime and conflict\n\nThere were reports of crime and conflict in the affected areas, including armed robbery and extortion.\n\n### Floods\n\nThere were reports of flooding in several areas, including the city of Gaziantep.\n\n### 2023 elections\n\nThe earthquakes did not affect the 2023 Turkish general election, which was held on May 14, 2023.\n\n### Education\n\nThe earthquakes resulted in significant disruption to education, with many schools damaged or destroyed.\n\n### Sports\n\nThe earthquakes resulted in significant disruption to sports, including the cancellation of several events.\n\n## Syria\n\nThe Syrian government provided limited assistance to the affected communities, including emergency aid and medical care.\n\n# International humanitarian efforts\n\n## Countries\n\nSeveral countries provided humanitarian assistance to the affected communities, including the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom.\n\n## Arab League\n\nThe Arab League provided significant humanitarian assistance to the affected communities.\n\n## ASEAN\n\nThe Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) provided humanitarian assistance to the affected communities.\n\n## European Union (EU)\n\nThe European Union provided significant humanitarian assistance to the affected communities.\n\n## North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)\n\nNATO provided humanitarian assistance to the affected communities.\n\n## United Nations (UN)\n\nThe United Nations provided significant humanitarian assistance to the affected communities, including emergency aid, shelter, and medical care.\n\n## World Bank\n\nThe World Bank provided significant financial assistance to the affected communities.\n\n# Reactions\n\n## Criticism of the Turkish government\n\nThe Turkish government faced criticism for its handling of the disaster, including the slow response and inadequate assistance.\n\n### Disaster management\n\nThe Turkish government's disaster management system was criticized for being inadequate and inefficient.\n\n### Media\n\nThe media in Turkey was criticized for its sensationalism and lack of coverage of the disaster.\n\n## Criminal investigation in Turkey\n\nA criminal investigation was launched in Turkey into the handling of the disaster.\n\n## National mourning\n\nThe Turkish government declared a national mourning period in response to the disaster.\n\n## Criticism by the Syrian government and opposition\n\nThe Syrian government and opposition criticized the Turkish government for its handling of the disaster.\n\n## Health concerns\n\nThere were concerns about the health and safety of the affected communities, including the risk of disease and injury.\n\n# Commemorations\n\nSeveral commemorative events were held to honor the victims of the disaster, including a national memorial service in Turkey.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of earthquakes in Turkey\n* List of earthquakes in Syria\n\n# References\n\n## Notes\n\n* The article was written by multiple contributors.\n* The article is based on publicly available information and sources.\n\n## Citations\n\n* This article does not include citations.\n\n## Sources\n\n* Various news outlets and sources were used to write this article.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

This article provides an overview of the series, its creation, and its impact on the art world.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nIn the 1960s, American artist Andy Warhol began creating a series of artworks that would become a cultural phenomenon. Warhol's fascination with consumer culture, celebrity, and mass production led him to create a series of silkscreen prints featuring Campbell's soup cans. The series, which debuted in 1962, marked a significant shift in the art world, challenging traditional notions of art and challenging the viewer to reevaluate what constitutes art.\n\n**Early Career**\n\nWarhol's interest in art began in the early 1950s, when he moved to New York City to pursue a career in commercial illustration. During this time, he worked as a commercial artist, creating illustrations for magazines and advertisements. However, it was not until the late 1950s that Warhol began to develop his unique style and aesthetic, which would eventually lead to the creation of the Campbell's Soup Cans series.\n\n**New York Art Scene**\n\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s, the New York art scene was dominated by Abstract Expressionism, a movement that emphasized the process of creating art over the final product. However, Warhol, along with other artists such as Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg, began to challenge this movement with their own unique styles and approaches. Warhol's use of silkscreen printing and his focus on consumer culture marked a significant departure from the traditional art world.\n\n**Pop Art**\n\nWarhol's Campbell's Soup Cans series was a key part of the Pop Art movement, which emerged in the early 1960s. Pop Art, also known as Popular Art, emphasized the use of popular culture and consumer products as the subject matter for art. Warhol's use of Campbell's soup cans, which were ubiquitous in American culture, was a prime example of this movement's focus on the everyday and the mundane. The series challenged the viewer to reevaluate what constitutes art and to consider the value of consumer culture.\n\n**Premiere**\n\nThe Campbell's Soup Cans series was first displayed at the Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles in September 1962. The exhibition was a groundbreaking event, marking the first time that Warhol's work had been displayed in a gallery setting. The exhibition was a huge success, with the series selling out quickly. The success of the exhibition marked a turning point in Warhol's career, establishing him as a major figure in the art world.\n\n**Subsequent Publicity**\n\nThe success of the Campbell's Soup Cans series led to extensive publicity for Warhol and the art world. The series was featured in numerous magazines and newspapers, including Life, Time, and The New York Times. The series also sparked controversy, with some critics arguing that it was not art at all, but rather a commercial advertisement. However, the series' popularity continued to grow, with Warhol becoming one of the most famous artists of the 1960s.\n\n**Campbell's Soup Company**\n\nThe Campbell's Soup Company, which was founded in 1869, was a major player in the food industry. The company's soup cans were a staple of American cuisine, with the company producing over 600 million cans per year. The company's iconic logo and branding were also a key part of the series, with Warhol using the company's logo and branding in his artwork.\n\n**Can and Label History**\n\nThe Campbell's soup can has a long and storied history, with the company first producing cans in the late 19th century. The cans were initially made of tin and were decorated with simple labels. However, in the mid-20th century, the company began to use more advanced materials and printing techniques, resulting in the iconic cans that Warhol used in his series.\n\n**Relation to Warhol's Art**\n\nThe Campbell's Soup Cans series marked a significant shift in Warhol's art, as he began to focus on consumer culture and the everyday. The series was a key part of Warhol's Pop Art movement, which emphasized the use of popular culture and consumer products as the subject matter for art. Warhol's use of silkscreen printing and his focus on consumer culture marked a significant departure from the traditional art world.\n\n**Inspiration**\n\nWarhol's Campbell's Soup Cans series was inspired by his fascination with consumer culture and the everyday. The series was also influenced by the art of Jasper Johns, who had previously used consumer products as the subject matter for his artwork. Warhol's use of silkscreen printing was also influenced by his commercial illustration background, where he had used the technique to create illustrations for magazines and advertisements.\n\n**Artist Colleagues**\n\nWarhol's Campbell's Soup Cans series was part of a larger movement of artists who were challenging the traditional art world. Other artists, such as Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg, were also creating artwork that focused on consumer culture and the everyday. The series was also influenced by the art of Roy Lichtenstein, who was creating similar artwork that focused on consumer culture and the everyday.\n\n**Interpretation**\n\nThe Campbell's Soup Cans series has been interpreted in a variety of ways, with some critics seeing it as a commentary on consumer culture and the everyday. Others have seen it as a commentary on the role of art in society, challenging the viewer to reevaluate what constitutes art. The series has also been seen as a reflection of American culture, highlighting the ubiquity of consumer products in everyday life.\n\n**Variations**\n\nThe Campbell's Soup Cans series was not static, with Warhol creating numerous variations of the series over the years. Some of the variations include:\n\n**Campbell's Soup I and Campbell's Soup Cans II**\n\nIn 1962, Warhol created two versions of the Campbell's Soup Cans series, titled Campbell's Soup I and Campbell's Soup Cans II. The two versions were identical, except for the color of the background, with Campbell's Soup I featuring a blue background and Campbell's Soup Cans II featuring a yellow background.\n\n**Colored Soup Cans**\n\nIn the mid-1960s, Warhol created a series of colored soup cans, which featured the Campbell's soup can design in a variety of colors. The series was a departure from the original black and white design, and marked a new direction in Warhol's art.\n\n**Unauthorized Versions**\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, unauthorized versions of the Campbell's Soup Cans series began to appear, created by artists who were inspired by Warhol's work. The unauthorized versions were often created using similar techniques and materials, and were often sold as art.\n\n**Other Variations**\n\nWarhol also created other variations of the Campbell's Soup Cans series, including a series of silkscreen prints featuring the Campbell's soup can design in a variety of colors and backgrounds. The series was a reflection of Warhol's fascination with consumer culture and the everyday.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Campbell's Soup Cans series is a landmark work of art that has had a significant impact on the art world. The series has been interpreted in a variety of ways, from a commentary on consumer culture to a reflection of American culture. The series has also been seen as a challenge to the traditional art world, highlighting the value of consumer culture and the everyday. Today, the Campbell's Soup Cans series remains one of the most famous and iconic works of art in the world.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Andy Warhol\n* Pop Art\n* Jasper Johns\n* Robert Rauschenberg\n* Roy Lichtenstein\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The Campbell's Soup Cans series is a key part of the Pop Art movement, which emphasized the use of popular culture and consumer products as the subject matter for art.\n* The series was first displayed at the Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles in September 1962.\n* The series has been interpreted in a variety of ways, from a commentary on consumer culture to a reflection of American culture.\n* The series has also been seen as a challenge to the traditional art world, highlighting the value of consumer culture and the everyday.\n\n**References**\n\n* This article has no citations or references, as it is a factual account of the Campbell's Soup Cans series.\n\n**External links**\n\n* The Andy Warhol Museum\n* The Campbell's Soup Company\n* The Ferus Gallery", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The mission was a critical step in the development of the Space Launch System, the Orion spacecraft, and the necessary technologies for deep space exploration.\n\n**Mission Profile**\n\nThe Artemis I mission was designed to test the performance and capabilities of the SLS rocket and the Orion spacecraft in a lunar-bound trajectory. The mission profile involved launching the SLS rocket from Kennedy Space Center's Launch Complex 39B, followed by a multi-day journey to the Moon, a lunar flyby, and a return to Earth.\n\n**Mission Profile Animation**\n\nAn animation of the Artemis I mission profile was created by NASA to illustrate the spacecraft's trajectory and the various stages of the mission. The animation shows the SLS rocket launching from Kennedy Space Center, followed by the Orion spacecraft separating from the rocket and entering into a lunar-bound trajectory. The animation also depicts the spacecraft's lunar flyby and return to Earth.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Artemis I mission was the culmination of years of development and testing of the SLS rocket and the Orion spacecraft. The mission was also a critical step in the development of the necessary technologies for deep space exploration, including the development of advanced propulsion systems and the testing of the Orion spacecraft's heat shield.\n\n### Ground Testing\n\nThe SLS rocket and the Orion spacecraft underwent extensive ground testing prior to the Artemis I mission. The testing included the integration of the rocket and spacecraft systems, as well as the testing of the rocket's propulsion systems and the spacecraft's communication systems.\n\n### Assembly\n\nThe SLS rocket and the Orion spacecraft were assembled at NASA's Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans, Louisiana. The rocket's core stage, which housed the rocket's four RS-25 engines, was integrated with the rocket's upper stage, which housed the rocket's four solid rocket boosters. The Orion spacecraft was also integrated with the rocket's service module.\n\n### Launch Preparations\n\nThe Artemis I mission was launched on November 16, 2022, from Kennedy Space Center's Launch Complex 39B. The launch was delayed several times due to technical issues with the rocket and the spacecraft. The launch was also delayed due to weather conditions, including high winds and heavy rain.\n\n### Initial Launch Attempts\n\nThe Artemis I mission was initially scheduled to launch on August 29, 2022, but the launch was delayed due to a technical issue with the rocket's RS-25 engines. The launch was rescheduled for September 2, 2022, but the launch was again delayed due to a technical issue with the rocket's solid rocket boosters.\n\n**Flight**\n\nThe Artemis I mission was a complex and ambitious flight plan that involved launching the SLS rocket, separating the Orion spacecraft from the rocket, and entering into a lunar-bound trajectory.\n\n### Launch\n\nThe Artemis I mission was launched on November 16, 2022, from Kennedy Space Center's Launch Complex 39B. The launch was a successful one, with the SLS rocket lifting off the launchpad and entering into a stable orbit.\n\n### Outbound Flight\n\nThe Orion spacecraft separated from the SLS rocket and entered into a lunar-bound trajectory. The spacecraft traveled at a speed of approximately 24,791 miles per hour (39,900 kilometers per hour), which is faster than the speed of a commercial airliner.\n\n### Lunar Orbit\n\nThe Orion spacecraft entered into lunar orbit on November 21, 2022, where it remained for approximately 30 hours. The spacecraft conducted a series of scientific experiments and tests during its time in lunar orbit, including the testing of the spacecraft's communication systems and the deployment of the spacecraft's solar arrays.\n\n### Return Flight\n\nThe Orion spacecraft departed from lunar orbit on November 22, 2022, and entered into a return trajectory to Earth. The spacecraft traveled at a speed of approximately 24,791 miles per hour (39,900 kilometers per hour), which is faster than the speed of a commercial airliner.\n\n### Reentry and Splashdown\n\nThe Orion spacecraft re-entered the Earth's atmosphere on December 11, 2022, and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean. The spacecraft was recovered by the U.S. Navy and returned to Kennedy Space Center for post-flight analysis.\n\n**Payloads**\n\nThe Artemis I mission carried several payloads, including cubesats, which are small satellites that are designed to conduct scientific experiments and tests.\n\n### Cubesats\n\nThe Artemis I mission carried several cubesats, including the Near-Earth Asteroid Scout (NEAR) and the Lunar Flashlight (LFA).

The election was the 46th federal election in Australian history, and it was held 40 days early due to Prime Minister Scott Morrison calling for an election on 11 April 2022. The election saw the return of the Liberal–National coalition to power, with a reduced majority.\n\nBackground\n\n### Previous election\n\nThe 2019 Australian federal election was held on 18 May 2019. The election saw the re-election of the Liberal–National coalition, with a reduced majority. The Australian Labor Party (ALP) won 68 seats, the Liberal Party of Australia (LPA) won 45 seats, and the National Party of Australia (NPA) won 16 seats. The Australian Greens won one seat.\n\n### Composition of parliament\n\nAt the time of the election, the composition of the Australian Parliament was as follows:\n\n* House of Representatives: 151 seats\n\t+ Liberal–National coalition: 75 seats\n\t+ Australian Labor Party: 68 seats\n\t+ Australian Greens: 1 seat\n\t+ Independents: 7 seats\n* Senate: 76 seats\n\t+ Liberal–National coalition: 35 seats\n\t+ Australian Labor Party: 26 seats\n\t+ Australian Greens: 10 seats\n\t+ Centre Alliance: 2 seats\n\t+ Jacqui Lambie Network: 1 seat\n\t+ One Nation: 2 seats\n\t+ United Australia Party: 1 seat\n\t+ Lambie Network: 1 seat\n\t+ Palmer United Party: 1 seat\n\n### Events of the 46th Parliament\n\nThe 46th Parliament of Australia was marked by several significant events, including the COVID-19 pandemic, the Black Summer bushfires, and the Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry.

Voters are required to rank candidates in order of preference, with the first-preference votes being counted first. If a candidate does not receive an absolute majority of the first-preference votes, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated and their votes are redistributed to the remaining candidates according to the next preference on each ballot.\n\nState of electorates\n\nAt the time of the election, Australia was divided into 151 electoral divisions, each with a population of approximately 80,000 people. The electoral divisions were redrawn in 2018, with some minor changes made to the boundaries. The electoral divisions were also divided into 39 metropolitan and 112 non-metropolitan divisions.\n\n### Redistribution\n\nIn 2021, the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) conducted a redistribution of the electoral divisions, which came into effect for the 2022 federal election. The redistribution resulted in some minor changes to the boundaries of the electoral divisions, with the aim of ensuring that the divisions were as close to equal in population as possible.\n\n### Election pendulum (House of Representatives)\n\nThe election pendulum is a graphical representation of the seats in the House of Representatives, showing the likelihood of each seat being won by the Liberal–National coalition or the Australian Labor Party. At the time of the election, the pendulum was heavily weighted in favor of the Liberal–National coalition, with 87 seats being considered safe or likely to be won by the coalition.\n\nVoter registration\n\nTo be eligible to vote in the 2022 federal election, voters had to be Australian citizens and at least 18 years old. Voters were also required to be enrolled to vote, either by updating their existing enrolment or by enrolling for the first time.\n\nElection date\n\nThe 2022 federal election was held on 21 May 2022.

The campaign lasted for 40 days, with the election being held on 21 May 2022.\n\nCampaign events\n\n### Leaders' debates\n\nThe leaders' debates were a series of debates between the leaders of the major parties, which were held during the campaign. The debates were televised and moderated by journalists, and they provided an opportunity for voters to compare the policies and personalities of the leaders.\n\n### Campaign\n\nThe campaign was marked by several significant events, including the leaders' debates, rallies, and policy announcements. The Liberal–National coalition ran a campaign focused on economic management and national security, while the Australian Labor Party ran a campaign focused on climate change and economic inequality.\n\n### Preferences\n\nThe campaign also saw the emergence of several minor parties and independent candidates, which ran campaigns focused on issues such as climate change, animal welfare, and social justice.

These clocks are considered the most accurate timekeeping devices in the world, and they play a crucial role in modern society, from coordinating global timekeeping to supporting scientific research.\n\n**History**\n\n### Definition of the Second\n\nThe concept of an atomic clock began to take shape in the 1950s, when physicists realized that the frequency of atomic vibrations could be used to define a new standard of time. In 1958, physicist Louis Essen and physicist Jack Parry developed the first atomic clock, which used the vibrations of cesium-133 atoms to measure time. This invention revolutionized timekeeping and paved the way for the development of modern atomic clocks.\n\n### Metrology Advancements and Optical Clocks\n\nIn the 1980s, metrologists made significant advancements in the field of atomic clocks, introducing new technologies such as optical clocks. Optical clocks use light to measure the vibrations of atoms, allowing for even greater accuracy than traditional atomic clocks. Today, optical clocks are considered the most accurate timekeeping devices in the world, with some types of optical clocks achieving accuracy of one second over tens of millions of years.\n\n### Chip-Scale Atomic Clocks\n\nIn recent years, the development of chip-scale atomic clocks has enabled the creation of smaller, more portable atomic clocks. These clocks use a combination of microfabrication and atomic physics to create tiny devices that can be used in a wide range of applications, from navigation systems to medical devices.\n\n**Measuring Time with Atomic Clocks**\n\n### Clock Mechanism\n\nAtomic clocks typically consist of several key components, including a reservoir of atoms, a cavity to confine the atoms, and a mechanism to measure the vibrations of the atoms. The most common type of atomic clock uses cesium-133 atoms, which vibrate at a frequency of 9,192,631,770 Hz. This frequency is used to regulate the clock's timekeeping.\n\n### Tuning and Optimization\n\nTo ensure accurate timekeeping, atomic clocks require periodic tuning and optimization. This involves adjusting the clock's frequency to match the true frequency of the atoms, as well as optimizing the clock's performance to minimize errors.\n\n**Accuracy**\n\nAtomic clocks are considered the most accurate timekeeping devices in the world, with some types of atomic clocks achieving accuracy of one second over tens of millions of years. This level of accuracy is essential for modern society, from coordinating global timekeeping to supporting scientific research.\n\n**Comparing Atomic Clocks**\n\n### Time Standards\n\nAtomic clocks are used to define modern time standards, including the international standard for time, Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). UTC is the basis for all modern timekeeping, and it is used by governments, businesses, and individuals around the world.\n\n### Synchronization with Satellites\n\nAtomic clocks are also used to synchronize time signals with satellites, which are used for navigation and communication. This ensures that timekeeping is accurate and consistent across the globe.\n\n### International Timekeeping\n\nThe International System of Units (SI) defines the second as the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium-133 atom. This definition is used by atomic clocks around the world to ensure accurate timekeeping.\n\n### Fiber Optics\n\nFiber optics are used to transmit time signals between atomic clocks, ensuring that timekeeping is accurate and consistent across the globe.\n\n**Microwave Atomic Clocks**\n\n### Caesium\n\nCaesium-133 atomic clocks are the most common type of atomic clock and are used to regulate modern timekeeping. They use the vibrations of caesium-133 atoms to measure time, and they are considered the most accurate timekeeping devices in the world.\n\n#### Block Diagram\n\nA typical caesium-133 atomic clock consists of several key components, including a reservoir of caesium-133 atoms, a cavity to confine the atoms, and a mechanism to measure the vibrations of the atoms.\n\n### Rubidium\n\nRubidium-87 atomic clocks are less common than caesium-133 atomic clocks but are still used in some applications. They use the vibrations of rubidium-87 atoms to measure time and are considered less accurate than caesium-133 atomic clocks.\n\n### Hydrogen\n\nHydrogen atomic clocks are also used in some applications and use the vibrations of hydrogen atoms to measure time. They are considered less accurate than caesium-133 atomic clocks but are still used in some niche applications.\n\n**Other Types of Atomic Clocks**\n\n### Quantum Clocks\n\nQuantum clocks use the principles of quantum mechanics to measure time and are considered the most accurate timekeeping devices in the world. They use the vibrations of atoms or other particles to measure time and are used in a wide range of applications, from navigation systems to medical devices.\n\n### Nuclear Clock Concept\n\nThe nuclear clock concept involves using the vibrations of atomic nuclei to measure time. This type of clock is still in the early stages of development but has the potential to be even more accurate than traditional atomic clocks.\n\n**Potential for Redefining the Second**\n\nThe accuracy of atomic clocks has led to proposals to redefine the second, using the vibrations of atoms or other particles to define a new standard of time. This would involve redefining the second to be based on the true frequency of the atoms, rather than the current definition based on the cesium-133 atom.\n\n### Rydberg Constant\n\nThe Rydberg constant is a fundamental constant of physics that is used to define the energy levels of atoms. It has been measured with high accuracy using atomic clocks and is considered one of the most precisely known constants in physics.\n\n### Requirements\n\nTo redefine the second, several requirements must be met, including the need for a new standard of time that is based on the true frequency of the atoms. This would require the development of new atomic clocks that are even more accurate than current clocks.\n\n### Secondary Representations of the Second\n\nSecondary representations of the second, such as the use of optical clocks or other types of atomic clocks, would also be required to support the new standard of time.\n\n**Applications**\n\n### Global Navigation Satellite Systems\n\nAtomic clocks are used in global navigation satellite systems, such as GPS, to provide accurate location and time information. They are used to synchronize the clocks of the satellites and to provide accurate timekeeping.\n\n#### Experimental Space Clock\n\nExperimental space clocks are being developed to provide even more accurate timekeeping in space. These clocks use the principles of quantum mechanics to measure time and are designed to be used in future space missions.\n\n#### Military Usage\n\nAtomic clocks are used in military applications, such as navigation and communication systems, to provide accurate timekeeping and location information.\n\n### Time Signal Radio Transmitters\n\nTime signal radio transmitters use atomic clocks to provide accurate time signals to the public. These signals are used to synchronize clocks and watches around the world.\n\n### General Relativity\n\nAtomic clocks are used to test the predictions of general relativity, which describe the behavior of gravity and time in the presence of massive objects.\n\n### Financial Systems\n\nAtomic clocks are used in financial systems to ensure accurate timekeeping and to support the operation of stock markets and other financial institutions.\n\n### Transportable Optical Clocks\n\nTransportable optical clocks are being developed to provide accurate timekeeping in remote locations, such as in space or on the surface of the Earth. These clocks use the principles of quantum mechanics to measure time and are designed to be used in a wide range of applications.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Atomic physics\n* Timekeeping\n* Quantum mechanics\n* General relativity\n* Navigation systems\n* Medical devices\n\n**Explanatory Notes**\n\n* This article is a comprehensive overview of atomic clocks, including their history, principles, and applications.\n* Atomic clocks are considered the most accurate timekeeping devices in the world and play a crucial role in modern society.\n* The accuracy of atomic clocks has led to proposals to redefine the second using the vibrations of atoms or other particles.\n* Atomic clocks are used in a wide range of applications, from navigation systems to medical devices, and are an essential part of modern technology.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

Discovery**\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery is an American multinational mass media and entertainment conglomerate. It is a result of the merger between WarnerMedia and Discovery, Inc. in 2022, creating a new entity with a vast portfolio of brands and assets in the entertainment, media, and broadcasting industries.\n\n**Background**\n\n### 1923–1979\n\nWarnerMedia has its roots in the Warner Bros. Pictures, Inc., a film production company founded in 1923 by the four Warner brothers: Harry, Albert, Samuel, and Jack. The company quickly gained popularity with its innovative film production techniques and the introduction of the \"WB\" logo. During the 1920s and 1930s, Warner Bros. became a major player in the film industry, releasing classics such as \"The Jazz Singer\" and \"42nd Street.\"\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, Warner Bros. expanded its operations to include television production, with shows like \"77 Sunset Strip\" and \"Maverick\" becoming huge successes. The company continued to grow and evolve throughout the 1970s, releasing films like \"The Godfather\" and \"Superman.\"\n\n### 1979–1994\n\nIn 1979, Warner Bros. Pictures was acquired by Warner Communications, a conglomerate led by Steve Ross. This marked the beginning of a new era for the company, with Ross's vision to expand Warner Bros.'s reach into the television and music industries. In the 1980s, Warner Bros. launched several successful television networks, including HBO, Cinemax, and The WB.\n\nThe company also made significant investments in the music industry, acquiring Atlantic Records and establishing Warner Music Group as a major player in the market. During this period, Warner Bros. released several blockbuster films, including \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" and \"Batteries Not Included.\"\n\n### 1996–2019\n\nIn 1996, Time Warner, Inc. was formed through the merger of Warner Communications and Time Inc. This marked the beginning of a new era for the company, with CEO Jerry Levin at the helm. Under Levin's leadership, Time Warner invested heavily in digital media, launching AOL, a pioneering online service provider.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Time Warner made several significant acquisitions, including Turner Broadcasting System and New Line Cinema. The company also released several successful films, including \"The Lord of the Rings\" trilogy and \"Harry Potter\" franchise.\n\nIn 2018, AT&T acquired Time Warner for $85.4 billion, marking a significant shift in the company's ownership and direction. Under AT&T's leadership, WarnerMedia continued to grow and evolve, releasing several successful films and television shows, including \"Wonder Woman\" and \"Game of Thrones.\"\n\n**History**\n\n### Formation and beginning of operations (2021–2022)\n\nIn 2021, Discovery, Inc. announced plans to acquire WarnerMedia from AT&T for $43 billion. The acquisition was completed in April 2022, creating a new entity known as Warner Bros. Discovery. The new company brought together a vast portfolio of brands and assets, including Warner Bros., HBO, Discovery Channel, and Turner Broadcasting System.\n\nThe formation of Warner Bros. Discovery marked the beginning of a new era for the company, with David Zaslav, the CEO of Discovery, at the helm. Under Zaslav's leadership, the company has focused on expanding its reach into new markets and exploring opportunities for growth and innovation.\n\n### Turnover and cutbacks (2023–present)\n\nIn 2023, Warner Bros. Discovery announced a series of cost-cutting measures, including layoffs and restructuring efforts. The company cited the need to adapt to changing market conditions and focus on its core businesses.\n\nThe layoffs affected several departments, including film and television production, as well as marketing and sales. The company also announced plans to consolidate its operations and reduce its overhead costs.\n\nDespite the challenges facing the industry, Warner Bros. Discovery remains committed to its mission of delivering high-quality content and entertainment experiences to audiences around the world. The company continues to invest in new technologies and innovative storytelling, and is committed to building a sustainable and successful future.\n\n**Assets**\n\nWarner Bros.

With a career spanning over six decades, Lewis has left an indelible mark on the music industry, and his influence can still be felt today.\n\n#Early life\n\nJerry Lee Lewis was born on September 29, 1935, in Ferriday, Louisiana, to Elmo and Mamie Lewis. He was the youngest of seven children, and his family was deeply rooted in the Christian Church. Lewis's early life was marked by a strong connection to music, with his mother teaching him to play the piano at the age of nine. He quickly became adept at playing the instrument and began performing at local churches and community events.\n\n#Career\n\n##J&M Studio\n\nIn 1956, Lewis traveled to Memphis, Tennessee, to record his first single, \"End of the Road,\" at J&M Studio. The studio was owned by Sam Phillips, who would later become a significant figure in Lewis's career. Phillips was impressed with Lewis's unique style and raw talent, and he offered him a recording contract with Sun Records.\n\n##Sun Records\n\nLewis's first single, \"Crazy Arms,\" was released on Sun Records in 1956. The song became a moderate success, but it was his next single, \"Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On,\" that brought him to national attention. The song's energetic and rebellious spirit resonated with the emerging rock and roll audience, and it became a huge hit.\n\n##Marriage controversy\n\nIn 1957, Lewis married his 13-year-old cousin, Myra Gale Brown. The marriage was widely criticized due to the significant age difference and the fact that Brown was still a minor. The controversy surrounding the marriage damaged Lewis's public image and led to a significant backlash from the media and the public.\n\n##Smash Records\n\nIn 1968, Lewis signed with Smash Records and released his first single, \"Another Place, Another Time.\" The song was a moderate success, but it was his next single, \"There Must Be More to Love Than This,\" that brought him his first Top 40 hit in over 10 years.\n\n##Live at the Star Club, Hamburg\n\nIn 1964, Lewis performed at the Star Club in Hamburg, Germany. The performance was recorded and released as a live album, \"Live at the Star Club, Hamburg.\" The album showcased Lewis's energetic stage presence and wide-ranging musical talents.\n\n##Country comeback\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, Lewis experienced a resurgence in popularity, thanks in part to his country music influences. He released several successful country albums, including \"The Session\" and \"Southern Roots.\" Lewis's music during this period was characterized by its honky-tonk sound and his distinctive vocal style.\n\n##Grand Ole Opry appearance\n\nIn 1980, Lewis made his debut at the Grand Ole Opry. His performance was met with a standing ovation, and he has since become a regular performer at the iconic venue.\n\n##The Session and Southern Roots\n\nLewis released two successful country albums, \"The Session\" and \"Southern Roots,\" in the early 1970s. The albums showcased his ability to blend traditional country music with his rock and roll influences.\n\n##Later career\n\nIn the 1990s and 2000s, Lewis continued to tour and release new music. He performed with a variety of artists, including Keith Richards and Bruce Springsteen. Lewis's later career was marked by a renewed focus on his country music roots, and he released several successful country albums.\n\n#Music legacy\n\n##Accolades\n\nThroughout his career, Lewis has been recognized with numerous awards and accolades. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1986 and the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2001. Lewis has also received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and a Kennedy Center Honor.\n\n##Piano style\n\nLewis's piano style is characterized by its unique blend of boogie-woogie and country influences. His playing is marked by its distinctive rhythm and his use of the piano's percussive qualities.\n\n#Personal life\n\n##Relationships and children\n\nLewis has been married four times, including his marriage to Myra Gale Brown, which was widely criticized due to the significant age difference. Lewis and Brown had three children together, including Steve Allen Lewis, Jerry Lee Lewis III, and Lori Lee Lewis.\n\n##Religious beliefs\n\nLewis has been open about his Christian faith and has credited his mother with teaching him the importance of church and music. Lewis has said that his faith has been a source of comfort and inspiration throughout his career.\n\n##Graceland arrest\n\nIn 1988, Lewis was arrested at Graceland, the mansion of Elvis Presley, after he was found to be in possession of a .38 caliber handgun. Lewis was charged with carrying a concealed firearm, and he was released on bail.\n\n##Debt\n\nIn the 1990s, Lewis filed for bankruptcy due to significant debt. Lewis had been plagued by financial difficulties for several years, and he was forced to sell several assets to pay off his creditors.\n\n##Health and death\n\nIn recent years, Lewis has experienced several health issues, including a series of strokes. Lewis passed away on October 28, 2022, at the age of 87. His death was met with an outpouring of tributes from the music industry and his fans.\n\n#Selected discography\n\n##Compositions\n\n* \"Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On\" (1957)\n* \"Great Balls of Fire\" (1957)\n* \"Breathless\" (1958)\n* \"High Heel Sneakers\" (1958)\n* \"Little Queenie\" (1959)\n* \"I'm on Fire\" (1964)\n* \"Another Place, Another Time\" (1968)\n* \"There Must Be More to Love Than This\" (1969)\n* \"Help Me Make It Through the Night\" (1970)\n* \"What Made Milwaukee Famous (Has Made a Loser Out of Me)\" (1970)\n\n#References\n\nThis article does not include any citations or references.\n\n#Further reading\n\n* Lewis, J.L.

He is also the founder of a private investment firm, Acre Constructions, and has been involved in various business ventures. However, his military career and personal life have been marred by controversy, including war crime allegations and a defamation suit.\n\nEarly Life and Family\nBen Roberts-Smith was born in 1978 in South Australia. His early life and family background are relatively unknown, as he has chosen to keep his personal life private. However, it is reported that he grew up in a military family and was exposed to the military lifestyle from a young age. This exposure likely influenced his decision to join the Australian Army.\n\nMilitary Career\nBen Roberts-Smith enlisted in the Australian Army in 2001, shortly after the September 11 attacks. He completed his initial training and was assigned to the Special Air Service Regiment (SASR), an elite special forces unit. During his time in the SASR, Roberts-Smith saw action in several conflicts, including the War in Afghanistan.\n\nBen Roberts-Smith's military career was marked by bravery and distinction. He was awarded several decorations for his service, including the Medal for Gallantry, the Medal for Distinguished Service, and the Commendation for Distinguished Service. His decorations reflect his bravery and dedication to duty, but they also highlight the risks and challenges he faced during his time in combat.\n\nMilitary Decorations\nRoberts-Smith's military decorations include:\n\n* Medal for Gallantry: Awarded for his actions during a firefight in October 2006, in which he single-handedly cleared a compound of enemy fighters.\n* Medal for Distinguished Service: Awarded for his leadership and bravery during a series of operations in 2007.\n* Commendation for Distinguished Service: Awarded for his service as a platoon commander during a counter-insurgency operation in 2008.\n\nCorporate Career\nAfter leaving the Australian Army, Roberts-Smith founded Acre Constructions, a private investment firm. He has also been involved in several other business ventures, including a property development company and a logistics firm. However, his business career has been marked by controversy, including allegations of war crimes and a defamation suit.\n\nOther Activities\nRoberts-Smith has also been involved in various other activities, including:\n\n* Writing: He has written several articles and opinion pieces for publications, including The Australian and The Australian Financial Review.\n* Public speaking: He has given several public speeches and presentations, including a keynote address at the 2014 Australian Business and Investment Conference.\n* Philanthropy: He has supported several charitable organizations, including the Australian War Memorial and the Returned and Services League of Australia.\n\nWar Crime Allegations\nIn 2018, Roberts-Smith was named in a report by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) alleging that he had committed war crimes during his time in Afghanistan. The report claimed that he had killed several civilians, including a mother and her child, during a firefight in 2009. Roberts-Smith denied the allegations, stating that he had acted in accordance with his training and the laws of war.\n\nInvestigation\nIn response to the allegations, the Australian Defence Force (ADF) launched an investigation into Roberts-Smith's actions during his time in Afghanistan. The investigation was led by a senior officer, who was tasked with gathering evidence and interviewing witnesses. However, the investigation was marred by controversy, including allegations that the ADF had failed to provide adequate support to the investigation team.\n\nDefamation Suit\nIn 2020, Roberts-Smith launched a defamation suit against the ABC and the journalist who had written the report alleging war crimes. He claimed that the report had damaged his reputation and caused him financial losses. The suit was widely seen as an attempt to silence the media and prevent further investigation into his actions.\n\nJudgment\nIn 2021, the court delivered a judgment in the defamation suit, ruling that the report had been published in good faith and that Roberts-Smith had failed to prove defamation. However, the judgment also highlighted the need for further investigation into the allegations of war crimes.\n\nAppeal\nRoberts-Smith has appealed the judgment, arguing that the court had erred in its decision. However, the appeal is still pending, and it is unclear how the matter will be resolved.\n\nFurther Controversy\nThe war crime allegations and defamation suit have sparked further controversy, including allegations of a cover-up and a culture of silence within the Australian Defence Force. The matter has also raised questions about the accountability of military personnel and the need for greater transparency and oversight.\n\nPersonal Life\nBen Roberts-Smith's personal life has been the subject of much speculation and controversy. He has been married and divorced, and has two children. However, he has chosen to keep his personal life private, and little is known about his relationships and activities outside of his business and military careers.\n\nReferences\nThe references for this article include:\n\n* Australian Broadcasting Corporation.

The album marks SZA's major-label debut and her first release in four years, following her critically acclaimed second studio album, Ctrl.\n\n**Background**\n\nSZA began working on SOS in 2020, shortly after the release of her critically acclaimed collaboration with The Weeknd, \"Good Days\". The album was initially intended to be a follow-up to Ctrl, but SZA's creative process and personal growth led to a more experimental and introspective album. In an interview with Rolling Stone, SZA stated that she \"wanted to make an album that reflected the different parts of my personality\" and that SOS was \"a reflection of my inner child, my adult self, and everything in between\".\n\n**Writing and production**\n\nSZA wrote and co-wrote all 14 tracks on SOS, collaborating with a variety of producers and songwriters, including David Rodriguez, Rob Bisel, and Devonté Hynes. The album's production style is characterized by its use of trap and R&B beats, with SZA incorporating elements of rock, pop, and electronic music. In an interview with Billboard, SZA stated that she was inspired by a range of artists, including The Weeknd, Frank Ocean, and Lizzo.\n\n**Composition**\n\nSOS is a concept album that explores themes of love, relationships, identity, and self-discovery. The album's 14 tracks are divided into three sections: \"SOS\", \"Ghost in the Machine\", and \"Kill Bill\". The album's first half, \"SOS\", explores themes of love and relationships, with SZA singing about her experiences with romantic partners and her own feelings of vulnerability. The second half, \"Ghost in the Machine\", delves into themes of identity and self-discovery, with SZA reflecting on her own experiences with mental health and her struggles with fame.\n\n**Title and artwork**\n\nThe title of the album, SOS, is a reference to the international distress signal used to signal emergency situations. The album's artwork features a image of SZA's face, with her eyes and mouth distorted and pixelated. The artwork was designed by visual artist and longtime collaborator, Jermaine Browne.\n\n**Promotion**\n\nTo promote SOS, SZA released a series of singles, including \"Good Days\", \"Snooze\", and \"Kill Bill\". SZA also performed a series of intimate concerts and festivals, including a headlining set at the 2022 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.\n\n**Critical reception**\n\nSOS received widespread critical acclaim upon its release. Reviewers praised SZA's introspective and personal songwriting, as well as her innovative production and vocal delivery. In a 4.5-star review, Rolling Stone stated that SOS was \"a deeply personal and introspective album that showcases SZA's remarkable range and vulnerability\". The New York Times praised SZA's \"lyrical nuance\" and \"sonic experimentation\", stating that SOS was \"a triumphant return from SZA\".\n\n**Reviews**\n\n* Rolling Stone: 4.5/5 stars\n* The New York Times: Critic's Pick\n* Pitchfork: 8.8/10\n* Billboard: 4/5 stars\n* NME: 5/5 stars\n\n**Year-end rankings**\n\n* Rolling Stone: 10th best album of 2022\n* Billboard: 5th best R&B album of 2022\n* Pitchfork: 5th best album of 2022\n\n**Awards**\n\n* Grammy Award for Best R&B Album (2023)\n* BET Award for Best Female Artist (2023)\n* BET Award for Best Album (2023)\n\n**Commercial performance**\n\nSOS debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling over 330,000 copies in its first week.

This led to the formation of a strong dry line, which played a crucial role in the development of severe thunderstorms.\n\n## March 26-27\n\nOn March 26, the low-pressure system strengthened further, and a strong low-level jet stream developed, bringing warm and moist air from the Gulf of Mexico into the region. This led to a significant increase in instability in the atmosphere, with CAPE values reaching up to 5000 J/kg. The combination of strong wind shear and instability led to the formation of multiple tornadoes across the region.\n\n# Confirmed tornadoes\n\n## March 24 event\n\nOn March 24, 2023, a total of 17 tornadoes were confirmed across the southeastern United States.

The election was the 26th general election since the establishment of the multi-party system in 1911.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe 2022 election marked the end of the eight-year term of the Löfven government, led by Prime Minister Stefan Löfven, which was the longest-serving government in Swedish history since the 1940s. The Löfven government was formed in 2014 and had been in power continuously since then, with some minor cabinet reshuffles.\n\n### Löfven's government\n\nDuring its eight-year term, the Löfven government implemented several significant policies, including the introduction of a universal basic income, a comprehensive review of the country's nuclear power policy, and a major overhaul of the tax system. The government also invested heavily in renewable energy, social welfare, and infrastructure development.\n\nHowever, the government faced criticism for its handling of several high-profile issues, including the 2017 Uppsala terror attack, the 2018 Swedish pension reform, and the 2019 Swedish housing crisis. The government's approval ratings suffered as a result, and the opposition parties began to gain momentum.\n\n### Andersson's government\n\nIn 2021, the Swedish Social Democratic Party, led by Prime Minister Stefan Löfven, was replaced by the Andersson government, led by Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson. The Andersson government was the first female-led government in Swedish history. The government's policy agenda focused on addressing the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, and social inequality.\n\nHowever, the Andersson government faced significant challenges, including a major migrant crisis, a severe shortage of healthcare workers, and a severe economic downturn. The government's approval ratings plummeted as a result, and the opposition parties began to gain momentum.\n\n**Electoral system**\n\nSweden uses a proportional representation electoral system to elect members of the Riksdag. The country is divided into 29 constituencies, each electing a number of representatives based on the number of inhabitants. The electoral threshold is 4%, meaning that parties must receive at least 4% of the national vote to gain representation in the Riksdag.\n\n### Political parties\n\nThe following parties contested the 2022 election:\n\n* **Social Democratic Party (S)**: The oldest and largest party in Sweden, the Social Democrats have traditionally dominated Swedish politics.\n* **Moderate Party (M)**: A center-right party that has been a major player in Swedish politics since the 1940s.\n* **Liberal Party (L)**: A liberal party that has been a junior partner in several governments since the 1970s.\n* **Christian Democrats (KD)**: A center-right party that has been a minor player in Swedish politics since the 1990s.\n* **Sweden Democrats (SD)**: A right-wing populist party that has been a major player in Swedish politics since the 2010s.\n* **Green Party (MP)**: An environmentalist party that has been a junior partner in several governments since the 1980s.\n* **Left Party (V)**: A left-wing party that has been a junior partner in several governments since the 1970s.\n* **Centre Party (C)**: A center-right party that has been a minor player in Swedish politics since the 1970s.\n\n### Pre-election composition\n\nAt the time of the 2022 election, the Riksdag consisted of the following parties:\n\n* **Social Democratic Party (S)**: 113 seats\n* **Moderate Party (M)**: 70 seats\n* **Liberal Party (L)**: 24 seats\n* **Christian Democrats (KD)**: 22 seats\n* **Sweden Democrats (SD)**: 20 seats\n* **Green Party (MP)**: 16 seats\n* **Left Party (V)**: 12 seats\n* **Centre Party (C)**: 11 seats\n\n**Campaign**\n\nThe 2022 election campaign was marked by several high-profile issues, including the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, and social inequality.\n\n### Issues\n\nThe main issues debated during the campaign included:\n\n* **COVID-19 pandemic**: The government's handling of the pandemic, including vaccination policies and economic support for affected businesses and individuals.\n* **Climate change**: The government's policies to address climate change, including renewable energy targets and carbon pricing.\n* **Social inequality**: The government's policies to address social inequality, including education reform, healthcare reform, and social welfare policy.\n* **Immigration**: The government's policies to address immigration, including asylum seeker policies and integration programs.\n\n### Party campaigns\n\nThe major parties launched several campaign slogans, including:\n\n* **Social Democratic Party (S)**: \"A strong Sweden for everyone\"\n* **Moderate Party (M)**: \"A new direction for Sweden\"\n* **Liberal Party (L)**: \"A liberal alternative for Sweden\"\n* **Christian Democrats (KD)**: \"A Christian perspective for Sweden\"\n* **Sweden Democrats (SD)**: \"Make Sweden great again\"\n* **Green Party (MP)**: \"A green alternative for Sweden\"\n* **Left Party (V)**: \"A socialist alternative for Sweden\"\n* **Centre Party (C)**: \"A rural perspective for Sweden\"\n\n### Debates\n\nThe major parties participated in several televised debates, including:\n\n* **Swedish Television (SVT)**: A traditional televised debate between party leaders.\n* **Sveriges Radio (SR)**: A radio debate between party leaders.\n* **SVT Nyheter**: A live debate between party leaders on social media.\n\n**Opinion polls**\n\nOpinion polls prior to the election showed a close competition between the Social Democratic Party and the Moderate Party.

He is the leader of the United National Party (UNP) and has been a key figure in Sri Lankan politics for over three decades.\n\nEarly Life and Education\n------------------------\n\nRanil Wickremesinghe was born on March 24, 1949, in Colombo, Sri Lanka. He is the son of Esmond Wickremesinghe, a lawyer and politician, and Maithree Wickremesinghe. Wickremesinghe's family is of Dutch Burgher descent, a minority ethnic group in Sri Lanka. He was educated at Trinity College, Kandy, and later at the University of Ceylon, where he earned a Bachelor's degree in Economics.\n\nWickremesinghe's early interest in politics was influenced by his father, who was a member of the UNP. He began his involvement in politics while still in school, joining the UNP's youth wing, the United National Youth Front.\n\nPolitical Career\n----------------\n\n### Batalanda Incident\n\nIn 1988, Wickremesinghe was appointed as the Minister of Youth Affairs and Women's Empowerment in the UNP government. However, his tenure was cut short when he was accused of involvement in the Batalanda incident, a human rights scandal in which several people were allegedly abducted and tortured by government agents.

It is situated on the northwestern coast of the island, approximately 30 miles northwest of the island's capital, Wailuku. With a population of around 12,000 people, Lahaina is a popular tourist destination known for its rich history, cultural significance, and natural beauty.\n\n**History**\n\nLahaina has a rich and diverse history that spans over 1,000 years. The town's name, Lahaina, is derived from the Hawaiian words \"la\" meaning \"cruel\" and \"haina\" meaning \"place,\" which refers to the town's reputation as a place where people were punished or stranded.\n\n### Modern name, etymology and pronunciations\n\nThe modern name \"Lahaina\" is believed to have been given to the town by early European visitors, who referred to it as \"Lahaina\" due to its reputation as a place of exile. The town's name is often pronounced as \"LA-hi-na\" by locals and tourists alike.\n\n### Ancient names\n\nBefore the arrival of European visitors, the town was known by several other names. One of the earliest known names for the town was \"Lahai'ai,\" which means \"cruel place\" in the Hawaiian language. Another name for the town was \"Pa'ia,\" which refers to the town's location on the northwestern coast of Maui.\n\n### Early rulers\n\nLahaina has been ruled by several different ali'i (Hawaiian chiefs) throughout its history. Some of the earliest known rulers of the town include:\n\n* **Kahikolu**: A 17th-century ali'i who is believed to have been the first ruler of Lahaina.\n* **Kaholokua**: A 17th-century ali'i who ruled over Lahaina and other parts of Maui.\n* **Kahikina**: A 17th-century ali'i who ruled over Lahaina and other parts of Maui.\n\n### Western contact\n\nLahaina first came into contact with European visitors in the early 18th century. The first Europeans to visit the town were Portuguese sailors, who arrived in the 1720s. Later, in the 1770s, British explorer James Cook and his crew visited the town, marking the beginning of Western contact with the Hawaiian Islands.\n\n#### Kahekili II\n\nKahekili II was a powerful ali'i who ruled over Lahaina and other parts of Maui in the 18th century. He is believed to have been the first ali'i to use firearms in battle, which gave him a significant advantage over his enemies. Kahekili II was also known for his strict laws and harsh punishments, which earned him the reputation as a cruel ruler.\n\n#### Kamehameha I and Kamehameha II\n\nKamehameha I and Kamehameha II were two of the most powerful ali'i in Hawaiian history, who ruled over Lahaina and the rest of the Hawaiian Islands in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Kamehameha I united the islands under one rule, while Kamehameha II abolished the kapu system, which was a strict set of laws and social norms that governed Hawaiian society.\n\n#### Christian missionaries\n\nChristian missionaries arrived in Lahaina in the early 19th century, with the goal of converting the Hawaiian people to Christianity. They established a mission in the town and began to teach the local population about Christianity. The missionaries had a significant impact on Hawaiian society, introducing new ideas and customs that eventually replaced traditional Hawaiian practices.\n\n#### Whaling\n\nLahaina became a major whaling port in the early 19th century, with whaling ships arriving in the town to hunt and process whales. The whaling industry brought significant wealth and prosperity to the town, but it also had a negative impact on the environment and the local population.\n\n#### Kamehameha III\n\nKamehameha III was the third king of Hawaii, who ruled over Lahaina and the rest of the Hawaiian Islands in the mid-19th century. He is known for his efforts to modernize Hawaii and introduce Western customs and institutions to the islands.\n\n#### 20th century\n\nIn the 20th century, Lahaina continued to grow and develop, with the town becoming a popular tourist destination. The town's historic district was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1962, and many of its historic buildings were restored and preserved.\n\n### 2023 wildfire\n\nIn 2023, a devastating wildfire swept through Lahaina, destroying many homes and businesses in the town. The fire was caused by a combination of strong winds and dry conditions, and it burned for several days before being brought under control.\n\n**Geography**\n\nLahaina is located on the west coast of the island of Maui, approximately 30 miles northwest of the island's capital, Wailuku. The town is situated on a narrow strip of land between the ocean and a large volcanic mountain range, which rises up to over 10,000 feet in elevation.\n\n### Climate\n\nLahaina has a tropical savanna climate, with high temperatures and high humidity levels throughout the year. The town experiences a wet season from November to March, with most of its annual rainfall falling during this period. The dry season, which runs from April to October, is characterized by clear skies and low humidity.\n\n**Demographics**\n\nAs of the 2020 census, the population of Lahaina was approximately 12,000 people. The town has a diverse population, with people from all over the world living and working in the area. The majority of the population is of Hawaiian or Asian descent, with a significant number of people of European and American descent also living in the town.\n\n**Arts and culture**\n\nLahaina is known for its rich cultural heritage, with a strong emphasis on traditional Hawaiian arts and crafts. The town is home to many galleries, museums, and cultural centers, which showcase the work of local artists and artisans. Visitors to the town can experience traditional Hawaiian music, dance, and crafts, as well as learn about the history and customs of the Hawaiian people.\n\n**Sports**\n\nLahaina is a popular destination for outdoor enthusiasts, with a range of sports and activities available in and around the town. Visitors can go surfing, snorkeling, or diving in the ocean, or hike and bike in the surrounding mountains and forests. The town is also home to several golf courses, tennis courts, and other sports facilities.\n\n**Popular culture**\n\nLahaina has been featured in a number of films, television shows, and books, including the popular TV show \"Hawaii Five-0\" and the movie \"The Descendants.\" The town's historic district and scenic coastline have been featured in numerous travel guides and brochures, making it a popular destination for tourists from around the world.\n\n**Gallery**\n\n* Aerial view of Lahaina\n* Lahaina harbor\n* Lahaina historic district\n* Lahaina coastline\n* Lahaina surf\n* Lahaina snorkeling\n* Lahaina hiking\n\n**See also**\n\n* History of Hawaii\n* Geography of Hawaii\n* Culture of Hawaii\n* Tourism in Hawaii\n* Sports in Hawaii\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is a general overview of the town of Lahaina, Hawaii.

The award, which translates to \"Golden Ice Axes\" in French, was first established in 1986 by the French mountaineering magazine, Le Monde du Randonnée.\n\n# History\n\nThe Piolets d'Or was created to recognize and celebrate the achievements of mountaineers who have pushed the boundaries of human exploration and achievement in the mountains. The award is considered one of the most prestigious honors in the mountaineering world, and it is presented annually at a ceremony in Chamonix, France.\n\n## Multiple Winners\n\nOver the years, the Piolets d'Or has been awarded to numerous mountaineers who have achieved remarkable feats in the mountains. In some years, there have been multiple winners, who have been recognized for their outstanding achievements in different disciplines. This approach acknowledges the diversity of mountain activities and the various skills required to excel in each area.\n\n# Criteria\n\nThe Piolets d'Or is awarded based on a set of criteria that evaluates the achievements of mountaineers in various disciplines, including alpinism, ice climbing, sport climbing, and speed climbing. The selection committee, comprising experienced mountaineers and experts in the field, considers several factors when evaluating candidates, including the difficulty of the climb, the innovation and originality of the achievement, and the impact of the achievement on the mountaineering community.\n\n# Reception\n\nThe Piolets d'Or has received widespread recognition and acclaim within the mountaineering community. The award has been seen as a way to celebrate and honor the achievements of mountaineers, who often face significant risks and challenges in pursuit of their goals. However, the award has also been subject to criticism and controversy over the years.\n\n## Criticism\n\nSome critics have argued that the Piolets d'Or is overly focused on individual achievement, rather than recognizing the contributions of the entire mountaineering community. Others have questioned the criteria used to evaluate candidates, arguing that they are too subjective and open to bias. Additionally, some have criticized the award for being too narrow in its focus, failing to recognize achievements in other areas of mountaineering, such as conservation and environmentalism.\n\n# 2023 Award (31st Awards)\n\nThe 2023 Piolets d'Or ceremony took place in Chamonix on March 10, 2023, and was attended by mountaineers and dignitaries from around the world.
