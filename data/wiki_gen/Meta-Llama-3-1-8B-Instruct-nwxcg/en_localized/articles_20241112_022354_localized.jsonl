As a result, the Russian women's curling team was not allowed to participate in the championship.\n\n### COVID-19 issues\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the 2022 World Women's Curling Championship. Several teams and players had to deal with COVID-19 issues, including positive cases and close contacts.\n\n#### Scotland\n\nThe Scottish team, led by Eve Muirhead, had to deal with a COVID-19 outbreak during the championship. Several team members tested positive for the virus, and the team had to play several matches with a reduced lineup.\n\n#### Japan\n\nThe Japanese team, led by Satsuki Fujisawa, also had to deal with COVID-19 issues. One of their players tested positive for the virus, and the team had to play a match with a substitute player.\n\n**Teams**\n\nA total of 13 teams participated in the 2022 World Women's Curling Championship, representing countries from around the world.

The deaths were primarily due to car accidents, hypothermia, and carbon monoxide poisoning.\n\n**Infrastructure**\n\nThe storm caused significant damage to infrastructure, including roads, highways, airports, and public transportation systems.\n\n### Flight Delays and Cancellations\n\nThe storm caused widespread flight delays and cancellations across North America. Over 1,000 flights were delayed, and more than 200 flights were cancelled at major airports in the United States. The FAA reported that the storm caused a 30% increase in flight delays and cancellations compared to the same period the previous year.\n\n### Road Closures and Crashes\n\nThe storm caused significant road closures and crashes across North America. Over 1,000 roads were closed due to heavy snowfall, icing, and flooding. The Texas Department of Transportation reported that over 200 roads were closed in the state, while the Oklahoma Department of Transportation reported that over 100 roads were closed.\n\n### Intra-City Transit Disruptions\n\nThe storm caused significant disruptions to intra-city transit systems, including buses and trains. Over 1,000 buses were taken out of service due to the storm, while over 500 trains were delayed or cancelled.\n\n### Inter-City Train Delays and Cancellations\n\nThe storm caused significant delays and cancellations to inter-city trains across North America. Over 100 trains were delayed or cancelled, including Amtrak and Greyhound services.\n\n### Energy Emergencies\n\nThe storm caused significant energy emergencies across North America. Over 1 million households were left without power due to the storm, with the majority of outages occurring in the eastern United States.\n\n### Power Outages\n\nThe storm caused significant power outages across North America. Over 1 million households were left without power due to the storm, with the majority of outages occurring in the eastern United States. The outages were caused by a combination of factors, including heavy snowfall, icing, and high winds.\n\n**Sports**\n\nThe storm caused significant disruptions to sports events across North America. Over 100 sports events were cancelled or postponed due to the storm, including NFL, NBA, and NHL games.\n\n**Corporate and Institutional Closures**\n\nThe storm caused significant disruptions to corporate and institutional operations across North America. Over 100 companies were forced to close or delayed operations due to the storm, including government offices, schools, and hospitals.\n\n**Animals**\n\nThe storm caused significant disruptions to animal care and welfare across North America. Over 1,000 animals were affected by the storm, including dogs, cats, and livestock.\n\n**Post-Storm Cold Wave**\n\nThe storm was followed by a significant cold wave across North America.\n\n### Rocky Mountain Region\n\nThe Rocky Mountain region experienced a prolonged cold snap following the storm, with temperatures plummeting to below -20°F (-29°C) in some areas.\n\n### Central United States\n\nThe central United States experienced a significant cold wave following the storm, with temperatures plummeting to below 0°F (-18°C) in some areas.\n\n### Eastern United States\n\nThe eastern United States experienced a significant cold wave following the storm, with temperatures plummeting to below 0°F (-18°C) in some areas.\n\n**See also**\n\n* List of North American winter storms\n* Winter storms in the United States\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is based on information available at the time of writing and may not reflect the current situation.\n\n**References**\n\n* This article does not include any references.\n\n**External links**\n\n* National Weather Service\n* Federal Aviation Administration\n* Transportation Security Administration\n* Department of Transportation", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

It was one of the largest banks in the United States and a leading provider of financial services to the venture capital-backed and private equity-backed companies, as well as to the venture capital and private equity firms that invest in these companies.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nSilicon Valley Bank's history dates back to 1983 when it was founded by a group of entrepreneurs and bankers who recognized the need for specialized banking services for the growing technology industry in Silicon Valley, California. Over the years, the bank grew rapidly and expanded its services to other parts of the country and globally. Its strong focus on the technology and life sciences sectors, coupled with its innovative approach to banking, made it a leader in the industry. However, in March 2023, SVB suddenly collapsed, marking one of the largest bank failures in U.S. history. This article provides an overview of SVB's history, growth, operations, and collapse.\n\n**Foundation and Early Growth**\n\nSilicon Valley Bank was founded in 1983 by Robert Medall, a former investment banker at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. Initially, the bank focused on providing financial services to the technology companies in Silicon Valley, including venture-backed startups and established companies. In the early years, the bank's growth was rapid, thanks to its innovative approach to banking and its focus on the technology industry. SVB's early success led to its listing on the NASDAQ stock exchange in 1995.\n\n**Expansion**\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, SVB expanded its services beyond Silicon Valley, opening branches in other parts of California and across the United States. The bank also expanded its services to other industries, including life sciences, clean energy, and biotechnology. To support its growth, SVB established a network of correspondent banks and investment banking divisions. In 2008, SVB acquired the private equity and venture capital financing business of New York-based bank, Wachovia, expanding its services to the East Coast.\n\n**Operations in Lead-up to Collapse**\n\n### Business Model\n\nSVB's business model was based on providing financial services to the technology and life sciences industries. The bank's services included deposit accounts, loans, investment banking, and payment processing. SVB's focus on the technology and life sciences sectors allowed it to understand the unique needs of these industries and provide specialized financial services. The bank's business model was designed to be profitable and efficient, with a strong focus on customer service.\n\n### Facilities\n\nSVB operated from a network of branches and offices across the United States and globally. In the United States, the bank had a presence in major technology hubs, including Silicon Valley, San Diego, Seattle, Boston, and New York City. Internationally, SVB had offices in London, Hong Kong, Singapore, and other major financial centers. The bank's facilities were designed to provide a high level of service to its customers, with state-of-the-art technology and a team of experienced bankers and financial advisors.\n\n### Affiliations and Community Involvement\n\nSVB was a member of several industry associations, including the Financial Services Roundtable, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, and the National Venture Capital Association. The bank was also a sponsor of several conferences and events related to the technology and life sciences industries. SVB's community involvement included supporting local charities and organizations, such as the Boys and Girls Clubs of America and the Silicon Valley Community Foundation.\n\n**Collapse**\n\nOn March 10, 2023, SVB announced that it would be selling its assets to First Republic Bank, another major bank in the United States. However, the deal fell through due to regulatory concerns, and SVB was unable to find a new buyer. As a result, the bank was placed into receivership by the Federal Reserve, marking one of the largest bank failures in U.S. history. The collapse of SVB had significant implications for the technology and life sciences industries, as well as for the broader financial sector.\n\n**References**\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n**Further Reading**\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n**External Links**\n\n* \n* \n* \n*", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The team represents Iran in international football competitions and is a member of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC).\n\n**History**\n\n#### Early years\n\nThe Iran national football team was formed in 1926, with the first international match played against Afghanistan on August 2, 1941. The team's early years were marked by occasional victories against regional opponents, but they struggled to achieve consistent success. Iran's first major international tournament was the 1951 Asian Games, where they finished fourth.\n\n#### After the Iranian Revolution\n\nFollowing the 1979 Iranian Revolution, the team's performance improved under the leadership of coach Ebrahim Mostafavi. They won the 1980 Asian Cup, defeating Kuwait 3-0 in the final. However, the team's success was short-lived, and they struggled to replicate their performance in subsequent years.\n\n#### 1998–2006\n\nThe late 1990s and early 2000s saw a resurgence in the team's fortunes under coach Jalal Talabi. They qualified for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, but were eliminated in the group stage. During this period, the team developed a new style of play, emphasizing quick counter-attacks and individual creativity.\n\n#### Temporary suspension\n\nIn 2006, the Iran Football Federation was suspended by FIFA due to government interference in the organization's affairs. The team was prevented from participating in international competitions, including the 2006 World Cup. However, the suspension was lifted in 2008, and the team resumed their international activities.\n\n#### 2007–14\n\nThe team experienced a resurgence under coach Carlos Queiroz, who was appointed in 2011.

These communities developed as a result of Greek colonization, trade, and cultural exchange with the indigenous populations of Africa. This article will explore the history of African Greeks, their interactions with the local populations, and the cultural and linguistic heritage they left behind.\n\n**Ancient Egypt**\n---------------\n\n### First Historical Colonies\n\nThe earliest recorded Greek presence in Africa dates back to the 7th century BC, when the city of Naucratis was founded in the Nile Delta by Greek colonizers. This marked the beginning of a long period of Greek influence in Egypt, which would eventually lead to the establishment of a significant Greek population in the country.\n\n### Hellenistic Times\n\n#### Rule of Alexander the Great (332–323 BC)\n\nWhen Alexander the Great conquered Egypt in 332 BC, he brought with him a large number of Greek soldiers, administrators, and settlers. These individuals played a crucial role in shaping the culture and politics of Egypt, introducing Greek language, architecture, and art to the local population. The city of Alexandria, founded by Alexander in 331 BC, became a major center of Greek culture and learning, attracting scholars and philosophers from all over the ancient world.\n\n#### The Ptolemaic Empire (323–30 BC)\n\nAfter Alexander's death, his general Ptolemy I Soter seized power in Egypt and established the Ptolemaic dynasty, which would rule the country for the next three centuries. During this period, the Greek population in Egypt continued to grow, with many Greeks settling in the cities and towns of the Nile Valley. The Ptolemies encouraged the development of Greek culture in Egypt, supporting the construction of temples, theaters, and other public buildings.\n\n### Roman and Byzantine Egypt\n\nWhen the Romans conquered Egypt in 30 BC, they brought with them their own language, culture, and institutions. However, the Greek language and culture continued to thrive in Egypt, and the country remained a significant center of Greek learning and culture throughout the Roman and Byzantine periods. The Copts, who were the indigenous Christian population of Egypt, developed a distinct Greek culture that blended elements of Egyptian, Greek, and Christian traditions.\n\n#### Coptic Greeks\n\nThe Copts, who were the native Christian population of Egypt, developed a unique cultural identity that blended elements of Egyptian, Greek, and Christian traditions. They used the Greek language in their liturgy and literature, and their art and architecture reflected a mix of Greek and Egyptian styles. Despite their distinct cultural identity, the Copts remained an integral part of the broader Greek-speaking community in Egypt.\n\n**Ancient Ethiopia**\n----------------\n\n### Axumites of Ethiopia\n\nThe Axumites were a powerful and influential kingdom that emerged in the 1st century AD in the highlands of Ethiopia. They developed a distinct culture that blended elements of Ethiopian, Greek, and Roman traditions. The Axumites were known for their advanced technologies, including stone architecture, metalworking, and irrigation systems, which were influenced by Greek and Roman know-how.\n\n### Abyssinian Greeks\n\nThe Abyssinian Greeks were a community of Greeks who settled in the kingdom of Axum in the 1st century AD. They played a significant role in shaping the culture and politics of the kingdom, introducing Greek language, architecture, and art to the local population. The Abyssinian Greeks were known for their expertise in engineering, architecture, and metalworking, which they brought to the kingdom from their homeland.\n\n**Ancient Libya**\n----------------\n\n### Libyan Greeks of Cyrenaica\n\nThe city of Cyrene was founded by Greek colonizers in the 7th century BC, and it became a major center of Greek culture and learning in the ancient world. The Libyan Greeks of Cyrenaica developed a distinct cultural identity that blended elements of Greek and Libyan traditions. They used the Greek language in their liturgy and literature, and their art and architecture reflected a mix of Greek and Libyan styles.\n\n### Libyan Greek Culture\n\nThe Libyan Greeks of Cyrenaica developed a unique cultural identity that blended elements of Greek and Libyan traditions. They were known for their expertise in agriculture, architecture, and engineering, which they brought to the region from their homeland. The Libyan Greeks of Cyrenaica also developed a distinct system of governance, which was influenced by Greek and Libyan institutions.\n\n**Ancient Nubia**\n----------------\n\n### Axumite Subjugation of Nubia\n\nIn the 1st century AD, the Axumites launched a series of military campaigns against the kingdoms of Nubia, which resulted in the subjugation of the region. The Axumites imposed their own culture and institutions on the Nubian kingdoms, introducing Greek language, architecture, and art to the local population.\n\n### Nubian Greeks\n\nThe Nubian Greeks were a community of Greeks who settled in the kingdom of Kush in the 1st century AD. They played a significant role in shaping the culture and politics of the kingdom, introducing Greek language, architecture, and art to the local population. The Nubian Greeks were known for their expertise in engineering, architecture, and metalworking, which they brought to the kingdom from their homeland.\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nThe history of African Greeks is a rich and complex one, spanning over a thousand years and encompassing various regions of the African continent. From the earliest recorded Greek presence in Egypt to the later Greek colonies in Libya and Nubia, the African Greeks developed a unique cultural identity that blended elements of Greek, African, and indigenous traditions. Despite their distinct cultural identity, the African Greeks remained an integral part of the broader Greek-speaking community in Africa, shaping the culture, politics, and institutions of the regions they inhabited.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The character was later developed by Charles Henry Hazlewood and other writers for the Amalgamated Press, a British publishing company. Over the years, Sexton Blake became a popular figure in British literature, with numerous stories, novels, and adaptations being published. This bibliography aims to provide a comprehensive list of Sexton Blake stories, novels, and other publications, highlighting the evolution of the character and the different eras of his literary career.\n\n**#Publication History**\n\nThe first Sexton Blake story, \"The Missing Millionaire,\" was published in _The Halfpenny Marvel_ in 1893. The character was created by Harry Blyth, a British author and editor, who wrote several stories featuring Sexton Blake for the magazine.

Part 1 includes stories published between 1893 and 1903, while Part 2 covers stories published between 1904 and 1913. Part 3 includes stories published between 1914 and 1923, and Part 4 covers stories published between 1924 and 1963.\n\n**#Notes to the Cases**\n\nSeveral notes are worth mentioning regarding the Sexton Blake bibliography. Firstly, some stories may have been reprinted or re-titled, which can make it difficult to determine their original publication date. Secondly, some stories may have been serialized, with the full story appearing over several issues of a magazine. Finally, some stories may have been adapted for film or television, which can affect their inclusion in this bibliography.\n\n**#1893 The Amalgamated Press Era Begins**\n\nThe first Sexton Blake story, \"The Missing Millionaire,\" was published in _The Halfpenny Marvel_ in 1893.

These risks can be categorized into political, logistical, and environmental factors. This article provides an overview of the background, political and logistical consequences, and lists of federal judges who have died in active service.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe United States federal judiciary is composed of over 870 judges, including Supreme Court justices, Court of Appeals judges, and district court judges. These judges are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate to serve for life. While the federal judiciary is designed to provide a stable and impartial branch of government, judges may face various risks that may lead to their death while in active service.\n\n**Political consequences**\n\nThe death of a federal judge in active service can have significant political consequences. In some cases, the death of a judge may trigger a vacancy that can be filled by the President through nomination and Senate confirmation. This process can be contentious and may be influenced by various political factors, such as party affiliation and ideology.\n\nThe death of a judge may also have an impact on the balance of power within the federal judiciary. If a judge dies, their seat may be filled by a judge with a different ideology or judicial philosophy, which can shift the balance of the court. This can have significant implications for the administration of justice and the interpretation of the law.\n\nIn addition, the death of a judge may also have an impact on the morale and stability of the federal judiciary. The loss of a colleague and mentor can be a significant blow to the morale of other judges and may lead to a sense of uncertainty and instability within the judiciary.\n\n**Logistical consequences**\n\nThe death of a federal judge in active service can also have significant logistical consequences. In the event of a judge's death, their chambers and staff may need to be reorganized, and new procedures may need to be established to manage the judge's workload.\n\nThe death of a judge may also have an impact on the administration of justice in their court. In some cases, the judge's death may lead to a backlog of cases and a delay in the administration of justice. This can be particularly problematic in courts with heavy caseloads, such as courts with significant numbers of civil or criminal cases.\n\n**Lists**\n\nThe following lists provide an overview of federal judges who have died in active service:\n\n### 1789–1869\n\n* John Jay, Chief Justice of the United States (1795–1800)\n* William Cushing, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court (1790–1810)\n* James Wilson, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court (1789–1798)\n* John Blair, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court (1790–1795)\n* James Iredell, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court (1790–1799)\n* William Paterson, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court (1793–1806)\n* Samuel Chase, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court (1796–1811)\n* Oliver Ellsworth, Chief Justice of the United States (1796–1800)\n* William Marcy, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court (1802–1811)\n\n### 1870–1919\n\n* Stephen J.

The protests were sparked by the country's severe economic crisis, which led to shortages of food, fuel, and medicine, as well as power outages and widespread unemployment.\n\n**Background**\n\nSri Lanka, a small island nation in South Asia, has been facing a severe economic crisis since 2021. The country's debt burden had increased significantly, and the government's inability to pay its debts led to a severe shortage of foreign exchange, which in turn led to shortages of essential goods and services. The economic crisis had a disproportionate impact on the poor and vulnerable sections of the population, who were already struggling to make ends meet.\n\nIn addition to the economic crisis, Sri Lanka has also been facing a severe political crisis. The government, led by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, had been accused of corruption, nepotism, and human rights abuses. The opposition parties had been demanding the resignation of the government and the holding of free and fair elections.\n\n**Timeline**\n\n### March\n\nThe protests began in March 2022, when a group of activists and opposition politicians organized a rally in Colombo, the capital city of Sri Lanka.

The attack was seen as a major escalation of the violence.\n\n#### Resignation of Mahinda Rajapaksa\n\nOn May 9, 2022, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa resigned, citing the need to allow a new government to take over. The resignation was seen as a major blow to President Rajapaksa's administration.\n\n#### Deployment of military\n\nOn May 10, 2022, the military was deployed in several parts of the country, in a move that was seen as an attempt to maintain public order and stability.\n\n#### Founding of No-Deal-Gama\n\nOn May 11, 2022, a group of protesters founded the No-Deal-Gama, a new protest movement that was seen as a challenge to the government's authority.\n\n### June\n\nThe protests continued in June, with several groups occupying public spaces across the country.

The storm caused widespread damage and flooding in Mexico and Central America.\n\nOther notable storms during the peak of the season included Hurricane Calvin, Tropical Depression Four-E, and Hurricane Dora. Hurricane Calvin formed on August 10, 2023, and became a Category 3 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 120 mph (190 km/h).

The project has since been recreated and updated in 2022 and 2023, allowing users to contribute to a large, pixelated canvas in real-time. This article provides an overview of the R/place experiment, its history, media response, and notable features.\n\n**Overview**\n\nR/place is a digital art project that allows users to contribute to a large, 1000x1000 pixel canvas. The canvas is divided into a grid of squares, each of which can be colored by a user. The project is designed to be collaborative, allowing users to interact with each other and create a shared artwork. The R/place project has been recreated and updated multiple times, each with its own unique features and challenges.\n\n**History**\n\n### 2017 experiment\n\nThe first R/place experiment was conducted in 2017 as a test of Reddit's real-time collaboration tools. The project was announced by Reddit's CEO Steve Huffman on April 30, 2017, and went live on May 3, 2017. The experiment allowed users to contribute to a 1000x1000 pixel canvas, with each user able to color a single square at a time. The project was designed to run for 72 hours, but it ended up running for over a week due to its popularity.\n\nDuring the 2017 experiment, the R/place canvas was filled with a variety of images and designs, including flags, logos, and even a crude drawing of Reddit's mascot, Snoo. The project also saw the emergence of user-created memes and jokes, which were often used to represent different communities and interests. Despite its short lifespan, the 2017 R/place experiment was a huge success, with millions of users participating and contributing to the canvas.\n\n### 2022 experiment\n\nThe second R/place experiment was conducted in 2022, six years after the first experiment. The project was announced on April 1, 2022, and went live on April 10, 2022. The 2022 experiment saw significant improvements over the 2017 version, including a larger canvas size (2000x2000 pixels), more user-friendly interface, and additional features such as user profiles and chat functionality.\n\nThe 2022 experiment also saw the emergence of new user-created content, including intricate designs, artwork, and even a fully-functional 3D model of the Reddit logo. The project was again a huge success, with millions of users participating and contributing to the canvas. However, the project also saw controversy and debate, with some users criticizing the project's moderation policies and others accusing the project of promoting hate speech.\n\n### 2023 experiment\n\nThe third R/place experiment was conducted in 2023, one year after the 2022 experiment. The project was announced on March 1, 2023, and went live on March 10, 2023. The 2023 experiment saw further improvements over the 2022 version, including a even larger canvas size (3000x3000 pixels), additional features such as user-generated stickers and emojis, and improved moderation tools.\n\nThe 2023 experiment also saw the emergence of new user-created content, including complex designs, artwork, and even a fully-functional virtual reality experience. The project was again a huge success, with millions of users participating and contributing to the canvas. However, the project also saw controversy and debate, with some users criticizing the project's moderation policies and others accusing the project of promoting misinformation.\n\n**Media response**\n\nThe R/place project has received widespread media attention and coverage, with many major news outlets and publications writing about the project and its users. The project has been featured on the front pages of The New York Times, The Guardian, and The Washington Post, among others. The project has also been covered by major tech and gaming outlets, including Wired, Forbes, and Kotaku.\n\nThe project's users have also been featured in various media outlets, including interviews and profiles in The Verge, The Huffington Post, and CNN. The project's users have been praised for their creativity, community spirit, and commitment to the project. However, the project has also faced criticism and controversy, with some users accusing the project of promoting hate speech and others criticizing the project's moderation policies.\n\n**Atlas**\n\nThe R/place project has a dedicated atlas that provides a comprehensive overview of the project's history, features, and users. The atlas includes a detailed timeline of the project's milestones, a list of notable users and their contributions, and a map of the project's canvas.\n\nThe atlas is regularly updated by the project's moderators and contributors, and is a valuable resource for anyone interested in the project. The atlas can be accessed through the project's website, and is also available as a downloadable PDF document.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Reddit\n* Collaborative art\n* Social media\n* Online communities\n* Digital art\n\n**External links**\n\n* R/place experiment website\n* Reddit R/place community\n* R/place atlas", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.
