Perched atop the Butte Montmartre, the church offers breathtaking views of the city and has become a symbol of Parisian culture and history.\n\n**#History**\n\n### **Proposal**\n\nThe idea of building a church on the Butte Montmartre dates back to the 19th century. In 1873, the Catholic Church in France proposed the construction of a church to commemorate the victims of the Franco-Prussian War. The proposal was met with resistance from the local population, who were concerned about the potential impact on the area's residents and the existing bohemian culture.\n\n### **Site**\n\nDespite the initial opposition, the project eventually gained momentum, and a site was chosen on the Butte Montmartre. The location offered a unique combination of stunning views of the city and a tranquil atmosphere, making it an ideal spot for a church. The site was also close to the Saint-Pierre-de-Montmartre church, which dated back to the 16th century and had become a popular destination for artists and intellectuals.\n\n### **Construction**\n\nThe construction of the church began in 1875 and took 46 years to complete. The project was overseen by architects Paul Abadie and Pierre Le Nôtre, who designed a Byzantine-style church with a distinctive white dome. The church was built using limestone and travertine, with a total of 15,000 tons of stone used in its construction. The interior of the church features a large nave, transepts, and a choir, all adorned with intricate mosaics and sculptures.\n\n### **Controversy over the church**\n\nThe construction of the church was not without controversy. Many residents of Montmartre were opposed to the project, citing concerns about noise, disruption, and the potential impact on the area's bohemian culture. The project was also criticized for its association with the Catholic Church, which was seen as a symbol of oppression and conformity. Despite these challenges, the church eventually became a beloved landmark in the city, attracting millions of visitors each year.\n\n**#Description**\n\n### **Exterior**\n\nThe Basilique du Sacré-Cœur is a striking example of Byzantine architecture, with a distinctive white dome that dominates the Parisian skyline.

The mosaic is a masterpiece of Catholic art, and it has become a symbol of the Basilique du Sacré-Cœur.\n\n#### **Chapels**\n\nThe Basilique du Sacré-Cœur features several chapels, each with its own unique character and history. The Chapel of the Immaculate Conception is dedicated to the Virgin Mary, and it features a beautiful statue of the Madonna.

The Romans acquired slaves through various means, including war, piracy, and debt, and they were used for a wide range of tasks, from household duties to agricultural labor and entertainment.\n\nOrigins\n--------\n\n### Enslavement of Roman Citizens\n\nSlavery existed in ancient Rome from its early days, with the first enslaved people being Roman citizens who were captured by enemies and sold into slavery. The Romans also enslaved their own citizens who were unable to pay their debts, and those who were convicted of crimes. This practice was known as debt slavery, and it was a major source of slaves for the Roman aristocracy.\n\nThe slave in Roman Law and Society\n--------------------------------\n\n### Marriage and Family\n\nSlaves were not considered to be full members of Roman society, and they were not allowed to marry or have children. However, there were some exceptions to this rule, particularly with regard to slaves who were manumitted, or freed, by their owners. Manumitted slaves were allowed to marry and have children, and they were considered to be full members of Roman society.\n\n### Peculium\n\nPeculium was a system used by Roman slave owners to reward their slaves for good behavior or to provide them with a means of saving money. It was a sum of money or goods that a slave was allowed to keep and use as they saw fit, and it was often given to slaves who were manumitted.\n\n### Manumission\n\nManumission was the process of freeing a slave, and it was a common practice in ancient Rome. Slaves could be manumitted by their owners, and in some cases, they could also be freed by the Roman state or by other means. Manumitted slaves were considered to be full members of Roman society, and they were entitled to the same rights and privileges as free citizens.\n\n### Freedmen\n\nFreedmen, also known as libertini, were slaves who had been manumitted and were considered to be full members of Roman society. They were entitled to the same rights and privileges as free citizens, and they were often employed in a wide range of occupations, from household duties to business management.\n\n### Dediticii\n\nDediticii were slaves who surrendered to their enemies during a war, and they were given the option of being sold into slavery. This practice was known as deditio in fidem, and it was a common way for slaves to be acquired by Roman slave owners.\n\nCauses of Enslavement\n--------------------\n\n### War Captives\n\nWar captives were a major source of slaves for the Romans, and they were often acquired during military campaigns. The Romans would capture enemy soldiers and civilians, and they would sell them into slavery.\n\n### Captivi in Roman Culture\n\nCaptivi was a Roman institution that allowed soldiers to take prisoners of war and sell them into slavery. This practice was considered to be a way for soldiers to enrich themselves, and it was often seen as a way to punish enemies.\n\n### Piracy and Kidnapping\n\nPiracy and kidnapping were other means by which the Romans acquired slaves. Pirates and kidnappers would capture people and sell them into slavery, and the Romans would often purchase these slaves.\n\n### Vernae\n\nVernae were slaves who were born into slavery, and they were considered to be the property of their owners.

They are well adapted to the harsh, cold climate of the tundra and subarctic regions, and are found in a variety of habitats, including forests, tundras, and Arctic deserts.\n\n**Description**\n\nReindeer are large, even-toed ungulates, with adults typically weighing between 150 and 200 kg (330-440 lbs). They have a distinctive set of antlers, which are grown by both males and females, although the females' antlers are generally smaller. Reindeer are known for their remarkable ability to survive in extreme cold, with some populations living in areas where the temperature can drop as low as -40°C (-40°F) in the winter.\n\n**Status**\n\nReindeer are found in a variety of habitats, including forests, tundras, and Arctic deserts. They are widely distributed across the Arctic regions of the world, including Alaska, Canada, Greenland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Russia. There are several subspecies of reindeer, including the Svalbard reindeer, which is found only on the Svalbard archipelago, and the Peary caribou, which is found in the Canadian Arctic.\n\n**Naming**\n\nThe term \"reindeer\" is derived from the Old Norse word \"hreinn,\" which means \"reindeer.\" In North America, the term \"caribou\" is often used to refer to the same animal. This is because the indigenous peoples of North America, such as the Inuit and the Cree, have traditionally referred to the animal as \"caribou,\" while the term \"reindeer\" is more commonly used in Europe and Asia.\n\n**Evolution**\n\nReindeer are thought to have evolved from a common ancestor with other deer species, such as the moose and the elk, during the Pleistocene era. They are believed to have originated in the Arctic regions of the world, where they were well adapted to the harsh climate. Over time, the reindeer evolved into a distinctive species, with a range of adaptations that allowed them to thrive in the Arctic environment.\n\n**Taxonomy**\n\n### **Naming and research on museum collections**\n\nThe taxonomy of the reindeer has been studied extensively through the examination of museum collections. Many of the early studies on the taxonomy of the reindeer were based on the analysis of museum specimens, which provided valuable information on the physical characteristics and distribution of the animal. The study of museum collections continues to be an important tool in the taxonomy of the reindeer, as it provides a valuable record of the animal's evolutionary history.\n\n### **Biological exploration expeditions**\n\nBiological exploration expeditions have also played an important role in the taxonomy of the reindeer. Many of these expeditions were conducted in the 19th and 20th centuries, when scientists were seeking to explore and map the distribution of the reindeer across the Arctic regions of the world. These expeditions provided valuable information on the physical characteristics and behavior of the reindeer, as well as its distribution and habitat.\n\n### **Reclassification**\n\nIn recent years, the taxonomy of the reindeer has undergone significant reclassification. Many of the traditional subspecies of the reindeer have been reclassified based on new evidence from genetic and molecular studies. For example, the Svalbard reindeer has been reclassified as a distinct species, while the Peary caribou has been reclassified as a subspecies of the reindeer.\n\n### **Ecotypes**\n\nEcotypes are groups of organisms that are adapted to specific environments or ecosystems. Reindeer are found in a variety of ecotypes, including tundra, Arctic desert, and boreal forest. Each of these ecotypes has its own unique set of adaptations, which allow the reindeer to thrive in its specific environment.\n\n### **Genetic, molecular, and archaeological evidence**\n\nGenetic, molecular, and archaeological evidence have all contributed to our understanding of the taxonomy of the reindeer. For example, genetic studies have shown that the reindeer has a complex genetic history, with many different subspecies and ecotypes. Molecular studies have also provided valuable information on the evolutionary history of the reindeer, while archaeological evidence has shown that the reindeer has a long history of human interaction.\n\n### **Novel genetics-based clades**\n\nNovel genetics-based clades are groups of organisms that are identified through genetic analysis. Recent studies have identified several novel genetics-based clades within the reindeer, which have provided new insights into the evolutionary history of the animal.\n\n**Species and subspecies**\n\nThere are several species and subspecies of reindeer, including:\n\n* Reindeer (Rangifer tarandus)\n* Svalbard reindeer (Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus)\n* Peary caribou (Rangifer tarandus pearyi)\n\n**Physical characteristics**\n\nReindeer have a number of distinctive physical characteristics, including:\n\n* **Antlers**: Reindeer have a pair of antlers, which are grown by both males and females. The antlers are made of bone and are shed and regrown each year.\n* **Pelt**: Reindeer have a thick, warm pelt that helps to keep them warm in cold temperatures.\n* **Heat exchange**: Reindeer have a number of adaptations that help to regulate their body temperature, including a countercurrent heat exchange system in their legs.\n* **Hooves**: Reindeer have hooves that are well adapted to the cold, snowy environments in which they live.\n* **Size**: Reindeer are a medium to large-sized animal, with adults typically weighing between 150 and 200 kg (330-440 lbs).\n* **Clicking sound**: Reindeer are known for their distinctive clicking sound, which is made by the movement of their hooves.\n* **Eyes**: Reindeer have eyes that are well adapted to the low light conditions of the Arctic environment.\n\n**Biology and behaviors**\n\nReindeer have a number of distinctive biological and behavioral characteristics, including:\n\n* **Seasonal body composition**: Reindeer have a seasonal body composition, with a greater proportion of body fat in the winter months.\n* **Reproduction and life cycle**: Reindeer have a complex reproductive cycle, with a gestation period of around 7-8 months.\n* **Social structure, migration and range**: Reindeer are known to form large herds, which migrate across the tundra in search of food and habitat.\n\n**Ecology**\n\nReindeer are found in a variety of habitats, including forests, tundras, and Arctic deserts. They are widely distributed across the Arctic regions of the world, including Alaska, Canada, Greenland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Russia.\n\n* **Distribution and habitat**: Reindeer are found in a variety of habitats, including forests, tundras, and Arctic deserts.\n* **Diet**: Reindeer are herbivores, and their diet consists mainly of lichens, mosses, and other plant material.\n* **Predators**: Reindeer have a number of predators, including wolves, bears, and humans.\n* **Other threats**: Reindeer are also threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation, as well as climate change.\n\n**Conservation**\n\nReindeer are an important part of the Arctic ecosystem, and are considered an endangered species in some parts of their range. Conservation efforts are underway to protect the reindeer and its habitat, including:\n\n* **Current status**: The current status of the reindeer is considered vulnerable, with a declining population trend in some parts of its range.\n* **Boreal woodland caribou**: The boreal woodland caribou is a subspecies of reindeer that is found in North America.\n* **Peary caribou**: The Peary caribou is a subspecies of reindeer that is found in the Canadian Arctic.\n\n**Relationship with humans**\n\nReindeer have a long history of interaction with humans, including:\n\n* **Indigenous North Americans**: The indigenous peoples of North America, such as the Inuit and the Cree, have traditionally hunted reindeer for food and clothing.\n* **Indigenous Eurasians**: The indigenous peoples of Eurasia, such as the Saami and the Nenets, have also traditionally hunted reindeer for food and clothing.\n* **Husbandry**: Reindeer are also domesticated in some parts of the world, including Norway and Finland, where they are used for their milk, meat, and hides.\n* **History**: Reindeer have been an important part of human history and culture, with a rich tradition of art and mythology surrounding the animal.\n* **Santa Claus**: Reindeer are also associated with the legend of Santa Claus, who is said to ride a sleigh pulled by a team of reindeer on Christmas Eve.\n* **Mythology and art**: Reindeer have a rich tradition of mythology and art, with many stories and images featuring the animal.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Caribou-specific links (North America)\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is a comprehensive overview of the reindeer, including its taxonomy, physical characteristics, biology and behaviors, ecology, conservation, and relationship with humans.\n* The article is based on a review of the existing literature on the reindeer, including scientific studies, books, and online resources.\n\n**References**\n\n* This article does not include any citations or references, as the information is based on a review of the existing literature.\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n* This article does not include a bibliography, as the information is based on a review of the existing literature.\n\n**External links**\n\n* This article includes a list of external links, including:\n\t+ Caribou-specific links (North America)", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The storm's complex and prolonged history made it one of the most significant weather events of the year, with significant impacts on the environment, infrastructure, and communities.\n\n### Formation and Intensification\n\nCyclone Freddy formed on January 6, 2022, as a tropical disturbance in the southwestern Indian Ocean, approximately 300 kilometers northeast of the Seychelles. At the time, the system was characterized by a low-pressure system with a broad area of thunderstorms and strong winds. The disturbance slowly organized, with a tropical depression forming on January 9.\n\nAs the system moved westward, it encountered favorable conditions for intensification, including warm sea surface temperatures, low vertical wind shear, and high levels of atmospheric moisture. The system rapidly intensified, with the tropical depression becoming a tropical storm on January 11. The storm was named Freddy, with the name being chosen from the list of pre-determined names for tropical cyclones in the Southern Indian Ocean.\n\n### The Mascarene Islands, Madagascar, and Mozambique\n\nOn January 12, Freddy made landfall on the island nation of Madagascar, bringing heavy rainfall and strong winds to the area. The storm caused significant damage and flooding in the capital city, Antananarivo, with reports of power outages, destroyed homes, and displaced communities. The storm also affected the nearby Mascarene Islands, including Réunion and Mauritius, with strong winds and heavy rainfall causing disruptions to transportation and communication.\n\nAs Freddy continued to move westward, it made landfall on Mozambique on January 21, bringing heavy rainfall and strong winds to the regions of Tete and Zambezia. The storm caused significant damage and flooding in the areas, with reports of destroyed homes, displaced communities, and loss of life.\n\n### Redevelopment and Dissipation\n\nAfter making landfall on Mozambique, Freddy began to reorganize over the warm waters of the Mozambique Channel. The storm slowly intensified, with a tropical depression forming on January 24. The system continued to strengthen, with Freddy re-developing into a tropical storm on January 26.\n\nAs the storm moved northwestward, it encountered increasing vertical wind shear and cooler sea surface temperatures, leading to a gradual weakening of the system. On February 3, Freddy weakened into a tropical depression, and subsequently degenerated into a remnant low-pressure system on February 6.\n\n### Records\n\nCyclone Freddy holds several records for the Southern Indian Ocean region. The storm was the longest-lived tropical cyclone in the region, with a duration of 37 days. It also holds the record for the most consecutive days as a tropical cyclone, with 25 consecutive days.\n\nFreddy's maximum sustained winds of 175 km/h (110 mph) and its minimum central pressure of 950 hPa (28.05 inHg) make it one of the strongest tropical cyclones to affect the region in recent years.\n\n### See Also\n\n* List of Southern Hemisphere tropical cyclones\n* List of intense tropical cyclones in the Southern Indian Ocean\n* Meteorological history of the Mascarene Islands\n* Meteorological history of Madagascar\n* Meteorological history of Mozambique\n\n### Notes\n\nFreddy's complex and prolonged history made it one of the most significant weather events of the year in the Southern Indian Ocean region. The storm's impacts on the environment, infrastructure, and communities were significant, and it will be remembered as one of the most intense and long-lived tropical cyclones in the region's history.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

It was designed and manufactured by the Integral Coach Factory (ICF) in Chennai, India. The train was introduced on February 15, 2019, and has been in operation ever since.\n\n**#History**\n\nThe Vande Bharat Express has a rich history that dates back to the 1960s when Indian Railways first began to explore the possibility of increasing the speed of its trains. This effort, however, was met with numerous challenges and setbacks.\n\n### **Efforts to increase speed (1960–2016)**\n\nIn the 1960s, Indian Railways initiated a project to increase the speed of its trains by introducing new designs and technologies. The first attempt was made with the introduction of the Shatabdi Express, which operated at a maximum speed of 140 km/h. However, the Shatabdi Express was not without its limitations, and it was soon realized that it was not designed to operate at higher speeds.\n\nIn the 1990s, Indian Railways again attempted to increase the speed of its trains by introducing the LHB (Linke Hofmann Busch) coaches. The LHB coaches were designed to operate at higher speeds and were introduced on several trains, including the Rajdhani Express. However, the LHB coaches were not without their own set of issues and were eventually phased out.\n\n### **Making an indigenous trainset (2016–19)**\n\nIn 2016, Indian Railways decided to design and manufacture its own high-speed trainset. The project was tasked to the Integral Coach Factory (ICF) in Chennai, India. The ICF was given a deadline of three years to design and manufacture the trainset, which was later named the Vande Bharat Express.\n\nThe design of the Vande Bharat Express was based on the LHB coaches, but with several improvements and modifications. The trainset was designed to operate at a maximum speed of 320 km/h and was equipped with advanced features such as regenerative braking, automatic doors, and a GPS-based automatic train control system.\n\nThe Vande Bharat Express was manufactured using advanced technology and materials, including stainless steel and aluminum. The trainset consists of 16 coaches, including two power cars, 12 passenger coaches, and two luggage-cum-brake vans.\n\n### **Introduction and further (2019–present)**\n\nThe Vande Bharat Express was introduced on February 15, 2019, on the New Delhi-Varanasi route. The train was inaugurated by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who praised the train for its advanced features and speed.\n\nSince its introduction, the Vande Bharat Express has been a huge success, with several other trains being introduced in the same class. The train has been praised for its comfort, speed, and advanced features, and has become a popular mode of transportation for passengers.\n\n**#Rolling stock**\n\nThe Vande Bharat Express is a high-speed electric multiple unit (EMU) train service operated by Indian Railways.

This era is considered a significant chapter in the history of Cornwall, marked by the development of complex societies, the emergence of distinct cultural practices, and the introduction of new technologies.\n\n**Chronology**\n\nThe Cornish Bronze Age can be broadly divided into four phases: the Bell Beaker period, the Early Bronze Age, the Middle Bronze Age, and the Late Bronze Age.\n\n### **Bell Beaker period (c. 2400–1700 BCE)**\n\nThe Bell Beaker period in Cornwall is characterized by the presence of distinctive bell-shaped pottery, which was introduced from the European mainland. During this time, the population of Cornwall was relatively small, and settlements were often scattered and ephemeral. The economy was likely based on hunting and gathering, with some evidence of early farming practices.\n\n### **Early Bronze Age (c. 2050–1500 BCE)**\n\nThe Early Bronze Age saw the introduction of metalworking in Cornwall, with the use of copper and bronze becoming more widespread. This period also saw the development of more complex societies, with the emergence of larger settlements and the construction of monumental architecture. The economy expanded, with the introduction of agriculture and the domestication of animals.\n\n### **Middle Bronze Age (c. 1500–1100 BCE)**\n\nThe Middle Bronze Age in Cornwall was marked by the peak of metalworking and the development of a more complex and hierarchical society. This period saw the construction of many of the region's most notable monuments, including the famous Hurlers stone circles. The economy continued to expand, with the introduction of new trade networks and the emergence of a distinctive Cornish culture.\n\n### **Late Bronze Age (c. 1100–800 BCE)**\n\nThe Late Bronze Age in Cornwall saw the introduction of new technologies and trade networks, including the exchange of goods with other parts of Britain and Europe.

The protests have been met with a heavy-handed response from the authorities, resulting in a significant number of arrests, crackdowns on dissent, and censorship of anti-war voices.\n\nStreet protests\n\nThe first wave of anti-war protests in Russia began in late February 2022, shortly after the invasion of Ukraine. Demonstrators took to the streets in cities across the country, including Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Yekaterinburg. The protests were largely peaceful, with protesters holding signs and banners denouncing the war and calling for an end to hostilities.\n\nFebruary\n\nThe first major anti-war protest in Moscow took place on February 24, 2022, with thousands of people gathering in Pushkin Square. The protesters held signs and banners, and some chanted slogans such as \"No to war!\" and \"We don't want a war!\" The Moscow police responded with a heavy presence, but the protest remained largely peaceful.\n\nMarch\n\nIn March 2022, anti-war protests continued to take place in cities across Russia. On March 6, 2022, a large protest took place in St. Petersburg, with thousands of people gathering in Palace Square. The protesters held signs and banners, and some chanted slogans such as \"Stop the war!\" and \"We are against the war!\"\n\nApril–June\n\nAs the war in Ukraine continued, anti-war protests in Russia showed no signs of abating. In April 2022, a large protest took place in Moscow, with thousands of people gathering in Pushkin Square. The protesters held signs and banners, and some chanted slogans such as \"No to war!\" and \"We don't want a war!\"\n\nIn May 2022, anti-war protests continued to take place in cities across Russia. On May 9, 2022, a large protest took place in St. Petersburg, with thousands of people gathering in Palace Square. The protesters held signs and banners, and some chanted slogans such as \"Stop the war!\" and \"We are against the war!\"\n\nIn June 2022, anti-war protests continued to take place in cities across Russia. On June 12, 2022, a large protest took place in Moscow, with thousands of people gathering in Pushkin Square. The protesters held signs and banners, and some chanted slogans such as \"No to war!\" and \"We don't want a war!\"\n\nSeptember\n\nIn September 2022, anti-war protests continued to take place in cities across Russia. On September 21, 2022, a large protest took place in St. Petersburg, with thousands of people gathering in Palace Square. The protesters held signs and banners, and some chanted slogans such as \"Stop the war!\" and \"We are against the war!\"\n\nOther direct action\n\nIn addition to street protests, anti-war activists in Russia have also engaged in other forms of direct action. One example is the \"No to war!\" campaign, which involves activists distributing leaflets and posters in public places calling for an end to the war in Ukraine.\n\nRussian military personnel\n\nThere have also been reports of Russian military personnel speaking out against the war. In August 2022, a group of Russian soldiers wrote an open letter to President Vladimir Putin, calling for an end to the war in Ukraine.\n\nPetitions and open letters\n\nAnti-war activists in Russia have also used petitions and open letters to express their opposition to the war. In August 2022, a group of Russian intellectuals and public figures signed an open letter to President Putin, calling for an end to the war in Ukraine.\n\nSymbolism\n\nThe anti-war movement in Russia has also used symbolism to express its opposition to the war. One example is the use of the \"No to war!\" slogan, which has become a rallying cry for anti-war activists. Another example is the use of the white-blue-white flag, which has been used by anti-war activists to symbolize their opposition to the war.\n\nThe green ribbon has also become a symbol of the anti-war movement in Russia. In June 2022, anti-war activists began wearing green ribbons as a sign of solidarity with those who were opposing the war.\n\nStatements against the war\n\nThere have also been statements against the war from Russian politicians and political parties, public figures, and organizations. In March 2022, a group of Russian politicians signed an open letter to President Putin, calling for an end to the war in Ukraine.\n\nIn April 2022, a group of Russian public figures signed an open letter to President Putin, calling for an end to the war in Ukraine. The letter was signed by prominent figures such as actors, writers, and artists.\n\nIn May 2022, a group of Russian organizations signed an open letter to President Putin, calling for an end to the war in Ukraine. The letter was signed by organizations such as the Russian Human Rights Council and the Russian Union of Journalists.\n\nCensorship and repression\n\nThe Russian government has responded to the anti-war movement with censorship and repression. In March 2022, the Russian government passed a law that restricts the dissemination of \"fake news\" about the war in Ukraine.\n\nIn April 2022, the Russian government began to crack down on anti-war activists, arresting and detaining dozens of protesters. The crackdown continued in May and June 2022, with reports of police brutality and mass arrests.\n\nWar censorship and fake news laws\n\nThe Russian government has also used censorship and fake news laws to suppress the anti-war movement. In March 2022, the Russian government passed a law that restricts the dissemination of \"fake news\" about the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe law requires social media platforms and online news outlets to remove any content that is deemed to be \"fake news\" or \"disinformation\" about the war. The law also requires internet service providers to block access to any websites that are deemed to be \"fake news\" or \"disinformation\" about the war.\n\nReprisals\n\nThe Russian government has also used reprisals to suppress the anti-war movement. In April 2022, the Russian government began to crack down on anti-war activists, arresting and detaining dozens of protesters.\n\nThe crackdown continued in May and June 2022, with reports of police brutality and mass arrests. In June 2022, the Russian government announced that it would be introducing a new law that would make it a criminal offense to participate in anti-war protests.\n\nMass arrests\n\nThe Russian government has also used mass arrests to suppress the anti-war movement. In May 2022, thousands of protesters were arrested in cities across Russia.\n\nThe arrests were made in response to a series of anti-war protests that took place on May 9, 2022. The protesters had gathered in cities across Russia to mark the 77th anniversary of the end of World War II.\n\nPolice brutality\n\nThere have also been reports of police brutality against anti-war protesters in Russia.

Some have expressed support for the movement, while others have expressed opposition.\n\nDomestic opposition to anti-war sentiment\n\nThere have been reports of domestic opposition to anti-war sentiment in Russia. In March 2022, a group of Russian politicians signed an open letter to President Putin, calling for an end to the war in Ukraine.\n\nHowever, the letter was quickly met with criticism from other politicians who accused the signatories of being \"traitors\" and \"enemies of the state\".\n\nExodus of Russians\n\nThere have also been reports of an exodus of Russians fleeing the country in response to the anti-war movement. In June 2022, it was reported that thousands of Russians had fled the country in response to the crackdown on anti-war activists.\n\nOpinion polls\n\nThere have also been opinion polls conducted on the anti-war movement in Russia.

The law also requires internet service providers to block access to any websites that are deemed to be \"fake news\" or \"disinformation\" about the war.\n\nImpact of international sanctions\n\nThe anti-war movement in Russia has also been impacted by international sanctions. In March 2022, the European Union imposed sanctions on several Russian individuals and entities in response to the war in Ukraine.\n\nLong-term prognosis\n\nThe long-term prognosis for the anti-war movement in Russia is uncertain. While some have argued that the movement represents a significant challenge to the Russian government's authority, others have argued that it will ultimately be suppressed.\n\nOverall opinion in Russia\n\nThe overall opinion in Russia on the anti-war movement is complex and multifaceted. While some have expressed support for the movement, others have expressed opposition.\n\nSee also\n\n* Anti-war movement\n* Russian invasion of Ukraine\n* Censorship in Russia\n* Repression in Russia\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n* Anti-war movement in Russia\n* Russian invasion of Ukraine\n* Censorship in Russia\n* Repression in Russia\n\nFurther reading\n\n* Anti-war movement in Russia: a timeline\n* Russian invasion of Ukraine: a timeline\n* Censorship in Russia: a timeline\n* Repression in Russia: a timeline", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The championship was held from November 26 to December 12, 2023, at FIDE House in El Khomsi, Tunis, Tunisia. This was the 65th edition of the World Chess Championship match, and it marked the first time that Ding Liren participated in a World Championship match.\n\n**#Carlsen refuses to defend the title**\n\nMagnus Carlsen, the reigning World Chess Champion at the time of the 2023 championship, announced in August 2023 that he would not defend his title. Carlsen cited burnout and a desire to focus on other aspects of his life as the reasons for his decision. This marked the first time that a reigning World Chess Champion had declined to defend their title since Bobby Fischer in 1975.\n\n##History of non-participation\n\nThere have been several instances in the history of the World Chess Championship where the reigning champion has declined to defend their title. One notable example is Garry Kasparov, who lost his right to defend his title in 2000 due to his dispute with FIDE. The 1975 World Chess Championship match between Bobby Fischer and Boris Spassky is another notable example, where Fischer refused to play the match due to his concerns about the safety of his family.\n\n##Candidates Tournament 2022\n\nThe Candidates Tournament 2022 was held from June 16 to July 3, 2022, in Madrid, Spain. The tournament was a 14-player double-round-robin competition, with the top two players advancing to the World Chess Championship match. Ding Liren and Ian Nepomniachtchi emerged as the top two finishers, securing their places in the World Chess Championship match.\n\n###Results\n\n| Rank | Player | Score |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Ding Liren | 11.5/14 |\n| 2 | Ian Nepomniachtchi | 11/14 |\n| 3 | Maxime Vachier-Lagrave | 10.5/14 |\n| 4 | Sergey Karjakin | 10/14 |\n| 5 | Levon Aronian | 9.5/14 |\n| 6 | Fabiano Caruana | 9/14 |\n| 7 | Viswanathan Anand | 8.5/14 |\n| 8 | Rameshbabu Praggnanandhaa | 8/14 |\n| 9 | Wang Yue | 7.5/14 |\n| 10 | Yu Yangyi | 7.5/14 |\n| 11 | Richárd Rapport | 7/14 |\n| 12 | Jorden van Foreest | 6.5/14 |\n| 13 | Pentala Harikrishna | 6/14 |\n| 14 | Saleh Salem | 5.5/14 |\n\n**Championship match**\n\nThe World Chess Championship match was played from November 26 to December 12, 2023, at FIDE House in El Khomsi, Tunis, Tunisia.

The process of Christianization, which began in the 1st century AD and continued until the 5th century AD, has been extensively studied and debated by historians. This article provides an overview of the historiography of the Christianization of the Roman Empire, its context, and the various factors that contributed to its spread.\n\n# History\n\n## Of historiography\n\nHistorians have long been fascinated by the Christianization of the Roman Empire. The process has been studied from various perspectives, including theological, sociological, and political. Early historians, such as Eusebius and Jerome, wrote from a Christian perspective, emphasizing the divine intervention that led to the spread of Christianity. Later historians, such as Gibbon and Voltaire, adopted a more skeptical approach, attributing the success of Christianity to its ability to infiltrate and manipulate Roman politics.\n\n## Roman religion\n\n### Context and other evidence\n\nRoman religion was a complex and multifaceted system that encompassed a wide range of deities, rituals, and practices. The Romans worshipped a pantheon of gods and goddesses, each associated with specific aspects of life, such as war, fertility, and prosperity. The Roman state sponsored a range of festivals and rituals, including the Lupercalia and the Saturnalia, which were attended by large numbers of people.\n\nThe Roman Empire was also characterized by a strong sense of tradition and continuity. The Romans believed in the importance of maintaining social order and stability, and their religious practices were designed to reinforce these values. The Roman pantheon was seen as a reflection of the social hierarchy, with the gods and goddesses representing different aspects of human life.\n\n### Spread of Christianity\n\n#### Origin\n\nChristianity originated in the 1st century AD in the Middle East, specifically in the province of Judea. The movement was founded by Jesus of Nazareth, who preached a message of love, forgiveness, and redemption. The early Christian community was characterized by its emphasis on the importance of faith, the role of the Holy Spirit, and the promise of eternal life.\n\n#### Reception and growth in Roman society\n\nChristianity initially encountered resistance and persecution from the Roman authorities, who saw it as a threat to the established order. However, the movement continued to grow, particularly in the urban centers of the empire. The early Christians were attracted to the message of Christianity, which offered a sense of community, purpose, and meaning in a chaotic and often brutal world.\n\nChristianity also appealed to those who were marginalized and excluded from Roman society, including slaves, women, and the poor. The Christian message of love and forgiveness resonated with these groups, who saw in Christianity a way to transcend their social and economic circumstances.\n\n#### Under Constantine and his Christian successors\n\nThe turning point in the Christianization of the Roman Empire came with the conversion of Constantine in 312 AD. Constantine saw Christianity as a way to legitimize his rule and to promote unity and stability within the empire. He issued the Edict of Milan in 313 AD, which granted freedom of worship to Christians and established Christianity as the official state religion.\n\nConstantine's successors, including Theodosius I and Theodosius II, continued to promote Christianity, using it as a tool to consolidate their power and to impose social order. Theodosius I, in particular, played a key role in establishing Christianity as the dominant faith in the Roman Empire.\n\n#### Theodosius I\n\nTheodosius I, also known as Theodosius the Great, was a Roman Emperor who ruled from 378 to 395 AD. He was a devout Christian who saw the faith as a way to promote unity and stability within the empire. Theodosius I issued a series of laws and edicts that established Christianity as the official state religion and imposed severe penalties on those who refused to convert.\n\nTheodosius I also played a key role in resolving the controversy over the divinity of Jesus, which had been a major source of division within the Christian community. He convened the Council of Constantinople in 381 AD, which affirmed the divinity of Jesus and established the Nicene Creed as the official statement of Christian doctrine.\n\n#### Theodosius II and Pope Leo I\n\nTheodosius II, who ruled from 408 to 450 AD, continued to promote Christianity and established the University of Constantinople, which became a major center of learning and theological debate. Pope Leo I, who ruled from 440 to 461 AD, played a key role in establishing the primacy of the bishop of Rome and in resolving the controversy over the authority of the Council of Chalcedon.\n\n### Sixth to eighth centuries\n\nThe sixth to eighth centuries saw a significant decline in the fortunes of the Roman Empire, which was plagued by external invasions, civil wars, and economic crisis. The Christianization of the Roman Empire continued, however, with the spread of monasticism and the establishment of a network of monasteries and convents.\n\nThe sixth century saw the rise of the Byzantine Empire, which became a major center of Christian learning and culture. The Byzantine Empire was characterized by its emphasis on orthodoxy, iconography, and liturgy, and it played a key role in shaping the course of Christian history.\n\n# Mathematical modelling\n\nMathematical modeling has been used to study the spread of Christianity in the Roman Empire. One approach is to use network theory, which examines the patterns of social interaction and communication that facilitated the spread of the faith. Another approach is to use epidemiological models, which study the dynamics of disease transmission and apply these principles to the spread of ideas.\n\n# Possible reasons for a top-down spread\n\n## Traditional conflict models\n\nOne possible explanation for the top-down spread of Christianity is the use of traditional conflict models, which emphasize the role of coercion and violence in shaping the course of history. According to this view, the Roman Empire imposed Christianity on its subjects through a combination of military force, economic pressure, and administrative manipulation.\n\n## Violence and temple destruction\n\nAnother possible explanation is the use of violence and temple destruction to spread Christianity. This approach emphasizes the role of radical Christian groups, such as the Maccabees and the Zealots, who used violence and terror to spread their message and destroy pagan temples.\n\n## Socio-economic factors\n\nSocio-economic factors, such as poverty, inequality, and social unrest, may have contributed to the spread of Christianity. Christianity offered a message of hope and redemption to those who were marginalized and excluded from Roman society, and its emphasis on community and social justice resonated with those who were seeking a more equal and just society.\n\n## Influence of legislation\n\nLegislation, particularly the Edict of Milan and the Theodosian Code, played a significant role in promoting Christianity and imposing penalties on those who refused to convert. These laws and edicts created a climate of fear and compliance, which contributed to the spread of Christianity.\n\n# Possible reasons for a grassroots spread\n\n## New ideas\n\nNew ideas, such as the concept of the Trinity and the importance of faith, may have contributed to the grassroots spread of Christianity. Christianity offered a fresh and innovative approach to spirituality, which resonated with those who were seeking a more meaningful and personal relationship with the divine.\n\n## Inclusivity and exclusivity\n\nInclusivity and exclusivity may have played a role in the spread of Christianity. Christianity was initially inclusive, welcoming people of all backgrounds and social classes. However, as the movement grew, it became more exclusive, emphasizing the importance of faith and the role of the Holy Spirit.\n\n## Kerygma (central message)\n\nThe kerygma, or central message of Christianity, may have contributed to its spread. The kerygma emphasized the importance of faith, the role of the Holy Spirit, and the promise of eternal life, which resonated with those who were seeking a more meaningful and fulfilling existence.\n\n# Alternative approaches\n\n## Network theory\n\nNetwork theory offers a alternative approach to understanding the spread of Christianity. This approach emphasizes the importance of social networks and communication patterns in shaping the course of history.\n\n## Psychology\n\nPsychology offers another alternative approach to understanding the spread of Christianity. This approach emphasizes the role of individual psychology and the importance of emotions, motivations, and cognitive biases in shaping the course of history.\n\n## Evolution\n\nEvolutionary theory offers a third alternative approach to understanding the spread of Christianity. This approach emphasizes the role of natural selection and adaptation in shaping the course of history.\n\n## Diffusion of innovation\n\nThe diffusion of innovation theory offers a fourth alternative approach to understanding the spread of Christianity. This approach emphasizes the importance of social and cultural factors in shaping the adoption and diffusion of new ideas.\n\n# Effects\n\n## Judicial penalties and clemency\n\nThe Christianization of the Roman Empire had significant effects on judicial penalties and clemency. The Edict of Milan and the Theodosian Code created a climate of fear and compliance, which contributed to the spread of Christianity.\n\n## Slavery\n\nThe Christianization of the Roman Empire also had significant effects on slavery. Christianity offered a message of hope and redemption to slaves, who were marginalized and excluded from Roman society.\n\n## Persecution of heretics\n\nThe Christianization of the Roman Empire also led to the persecution of heretics, including those who refused to convert to Christianity. The Edict of Milan and the Theodosian Code created a climate of fear and compliance, which contributed to the spread of Christianity.\n\n## Corruption\n\nThe Christianization of the Roman Empire also led to corruption, particularly in the form of church corruption. The wealth and power of the Church created opportunities for corruption and abuse of power.\n\n## Gladiator games\n\nThe Christianization of the Roman Empire also led to a decline in the popularity of gladiator games. Christianity offered a message of non-violence and compassion, which resonated with those who were seeking a more peaceful and humane society.\n\n## Intolerance\n\nThe Christianization of the Roman Empire also led to intolerance, particularly towards those who refused to convert to Christianity. The Edict of Milan and the Theodosian Code created a climate of fear and compliance, which contributed to the spread of Christianity.\n\n## Difference in sexual morality\n\nThe Christianization of the Roman Empire also led to a difference in sexual morality, particularly in the form of a more restrictive view of sex and marriage. Christianity offered a message of chastity and fidelity, which resonated with those who were seeking a more moral and upright society.\n\n## Sanctity of life\n\nThe Christianization of the Roman Empire also led to a greater emphasis on the sanctity of life, particularly in the form of a more restrictive view of abortion and infanticide. Christianity offered a message of compassion and care for the vulnerable, which resonated with those who were seeking a more just and humane society.\n\n## Education\n\nThe Christianization of the Roman Empire also led to a greater emphasis on education, particularly in the form of a more widespread and accessible education system. Christianity offered a message of knowledge and understanding, which resonated with those who were seeking a more enlightened and informed society.\n\n## Sociological effects\n\nThe Christianization of the Roman Empire also had significant sociological effects, particularly in the form of a more cohesive and harmonious society. Christianity offered a message of unity and cooperation, which resonated with those who were seeking a more peaceful and harmonious society.\n\n## Law\n\nThe Christianization of the Roman Empire also led to a greater emphasis on law, particularly in the form of a more codified and accessible legal system. Christianity offered a message of justice and fairness, which resonated with those who were seeking a more just and fair society.\n\n# See also\n\n* Christianization of the Roman Empire\n* Early Christianity\n* Roman Empire\n* Byzantine Empire\n* Church history\n* Theology\n* History of Christianity\n\n# Notes\n\n* This article is a general overview of the Christianization of the Roman Empire and its effects on the course of history.\n* The article is based on a wide range of sources, including historical texts, scholarly articles, and secondary sources.\n* The article is intended to provide a neutral and encyclopedic overview of the topic, rather than to promote a particular point of view or agenda.\n\n# References\n\n* This article does not include any citations or references, as it is intended to provide a general overview of the topic rather than a scholarly treatment.\n\n# Bibliography\n\n* The bibliography for this article includes a wide range of sources, including historical texts, scholarly articles, and secondary sources.\n* Some notable sources include:\n\t+ Eusebius, The History of the Church\n\t+ Gibbon, Edward, The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\n\t+ Voltaire, Candide\n\t+ The New Testament\n\t+ The Nicene Creed\n\t+ The Edict of Milan\n\t+ The Theodosian Code\n\t+ The Byzantine Empire\n\t+ The Church history\n\t+ Theology\n\t+ History of Christianity", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.
