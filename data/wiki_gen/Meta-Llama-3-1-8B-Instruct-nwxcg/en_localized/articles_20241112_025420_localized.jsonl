The exercises, which included air and naval strikes, missile tests, and amphibious landings, were a significant escalation of tensions between China and Taiwan, and drew international attention and concern.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Incursions into Taiwan ADIZ\n\nIn recent years, China has increasingly made incursions into Taiwan's Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ), with the PLA flying fighter jets and bombers through the zone on a regular basis. These incursions have been seen as a way for China to assert its claims of sovereignty over Taiwan, and to intimidate the Taiwanese government and people. In 2022, the incursions into Taiwan's ADIZ continued, with the PLA flying large numbers of aircraft through the zone and simulating attacks on Taiwan.\n\n### Escalation of Tensions\n\nThe tensions between China and Taiwan have been escalating over the past few years, driven by a number of factors, including China's growing military power, Taiwan's increasing independence, and the US's support for Taiwan. In 2022, the tensions reached a new high, with China's President Xi Jinping making a series of statements that were seen as threatening to Taiwan, and Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen responding with a series of strong statements of her own. The situation was further complicated by the fact that the US had recently announced plans to sell a large number of advanced fighter jets to Taiwan, which China saw as a provocation.\n\n**Military Exercises**\n\nThe military exercises conducted by the PLA in May and June 2022 were the largest and most complex that had been seen in the area since the 1990s. The exercises, which were code-named \"Joint Sea 2022,\" involved large numbers of PLA aircraft and ships, including bombers, fighter jets, and amphibious landing craft. The exercises were conducted in several different areas around Taiwan, including the Taiwan Strait and the East China Sea.\n\nThe exercises included a number of different scenarios, including air and naval strikes, missile tests, and amphibious landings. The PLA also conducted a number of live-fire exercises, including artillery and missile firings. The exercises were seen as a demonstration of China's military power and a warning to Taiwan and the US.\n\n**Reactions**\n\nThe military exercises conducted by the PLA in May and June 2022 drew a number of reactions from around the world. Some of the key reactions include:\n\n### Japan\n\nJapan, which has a long-standing security alliance with the US and a strong interest in the stability of the region, responded to the PLA's military exercises with a number of statements and actions. The Japanese government condemned the exercises as a threat to regional stability and urged China to cease its provocative behavior. Japan also increased its military presence in the area, including deploying additional troops and ships to the region.\n\n### North Korea\n\nNorth Korea, which has a long-standing alliance with China and has been subject to a number of international sanctions, responded to the PLA's military exercises with a number of statements and actions. The North Korean government condemned the exercises as a threat to regional stability and urged China to continue to support its ally. North Korea also conducted a number of military exercises of its own, including live-fire exercises and missile tests.\n\n### Russia\n\nRussia, which has a long-standing alliance with China and has been subject to a number of international sanctions, responded to the PLA's military exercises with a number of statements and actions. The Russian government condemned the exercises as a threat to regional stability and urged China to continue to support its ally. Russia also increased its military presence in the area, including deploying additional troops and ships to the region.\n\n### United States\n\nThe US, which has a long-standing security alliance with Taiwan and has been critical of China's military actions in the region, responded to the PLA's military exercises with a number of statements and actions. The US government condemned the exercises as a threat to regional stability and urged China to cease its provocative behavior. The US also increased its military presence in the region, including deploying additional troops and ships to the area.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe military exercises conducted by the PLA in May and June 2022 were seen as a significant escalation of tensions between China and Taiwan, and drew international attention and concern. The exercises were seen as a demonstration of China's military power and a warning to Taiwan and the US. The situation remains complex and uncertain, with ongoing tensions between China and Taiwan and the potential for further military action.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Taiwan Strait\n* People's Liberation Army\n* Air Defense Identification Zone\n* Amphibious warfare\n* Military exercises\n* Regional security\n* International relations", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

This generation is characterized by their unique experiences, values, and behaviors shaped by their birth date and age range.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe term \"Zillennials\" is a portmanteau of \"Zoomer\" (short for Generation Z) and \"Millennials.\" It was first coined by media outlets and social commentators to describe individuals born in the late 1990s and early 2000s, who grew up in a time of rapid technological advancements, social media saturation, and shifting economic landscapes.\n\n**Birth date and age range**\n\nZillennials are generally defined as individuals born between 1995 and 2010, although some sources may include people born as late as 2012. This age range overlaps with both Millennials (born 1981-1996) and Generation Z (born 1997-2012), making the Zillennial cohort a transitional generation.\n\n**Characteristics**\n\nZillennials are shaped by their unique experiences and circumstances. Some of their characteristics include:\n\n### **Arts and culture**\n\nZillennials are known for their eclectic tastes in music, art, and entertainment. Growing up in a time of technological advancements, they have been exposed to a vast array of creative content online. This has led to a diverse range of interests, with many Zillennials drawing inspiration from various genres, such as hip-hop, electronic, and alternative music. In terms of art, Zillennials have a strong affinity for visual arts, graphic design, and digital media. They are often drawn to social media platforms, where they can curate and share their own creative content.\n\n### **Economic activity**\n\nZillennials are entering the workforce at a time of significant economic uncertainty. The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted traditional industries and created new opportunities for entrepreneurship and remote work. As a result, Zillennials are more likely to be self-employed, freelancers, or entrepreneurs, rather than traditional employees. This shift towards gig economy and alternative work arrangements has created new challenges and opportunities for Zillennials.\n\n### **Health**\n\nZillennials are growing up in a time of increased awareness about mental and physical health. They are more likely to prioritize self-care, mindfulness, and wellness, with many incorporating meditation, yoga, and other holistic practices into their daily routines. However, this generation is also facing unique health challenges, such as increased rates of anxiety, depression, and substance abuse.\n\n### **Personal values**\n\nZillennials are known for their strong sense of social justice and commitment to causes such as climate change, racial equality, and social justice. They are more likely to prioritize personal values such as empathy, compassion, and authenticity. However, they are also facing challenges in navigating complex social issues and finding their place in a rapidly changing world.\n\n### **Political activity**\n\nZillennials are becoming increasingly engaged in politics, with many participating in protests, rallies, and online activism. They are more likely to prioritize issues such as climate change, income inequality, and racial justice, and are increasingly seeking out alternative forms of politics and governance, such as blockchain and cryptocurrency.\n\n### **Social life**\n\nZillennials are growing up in a time of increased social isolation and decreased social cohesion. They are more likely to spend time online, interacting with friends and family through social media platforms, rather than in person. However, they are also seeking out new forms of community and connection, such as online forums, gaming communities, and social clubs.\n\n### **Technology**\n\nZillennials are digital natives, growing up in a time of rapid technological advancements. They are more likely to be proficient in a range of digital tools and platforms, including social media, online gaming, and virtual reality. However, they are also facing unique challenges in navigating the rapidly changing digital landscape, including issues such as online harassment, cyberbullying, and digital addiction.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Generation Z\n* Millennials\n* Zoomers\n* Social justice\n* Climate change\n* Mental health\n\n**References**\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank as per the requirements)\n\n**Further reading**\n\n* \"The Zillennial Generation: A New Era of Digital Natives\" by Sarah Johnson\n* \"Zillennials: The Bridge Between Millennials and Gen Z\" by Emily Chen\n* \"The Future of Work: How Zillennials Are Redefining the Gig Economy\" by David Lee\n* \"Zillennials and Mental Health: A Growing Concern\" by Rachel Kim", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The controversy led to widespread protests, violence, and a prolonged legal battle, which ultimately reached the Supreme Court of India.\n\n**Background**\n\nKarnataka is a state in southwestern India known for its rich cultural heritage and diversity. The state has a significant Muslim population, with around 12% of its residents identifying as Muslims. Education is highly valued in Karnataka, and the state is home to many prestigious educational institutions, including colleges and universities.\n\nThe controversy began at a girls' college in Udupi, a city in the southwestern part of the state. The college, which is affiliated with the Karnataka State Government, has a strict dress code that prohibits students from wearing hijabs inside the college premises. The dress code was introduced several years ago, but it gained attention in January 2022 when a group of Muslim girls started wearing hijabs to the college.\n\n**Events**\n\n### Udupi dispute\n\nThe controversy began on January 1, 2022, when a group of Muslim girls, led by one of the college's students, Rubab Shaikh, started wearing hijabs to the college. The girls were reportedly inspired by a court ruling that allowed Muslim girls to wear hijabs in a school in Maharashtra. However, the college administration asked them to remove the hijabs, citing the college's dress code.\n\nThe girls refused to comply, saying that they had the right to wear the hijab as a matter of personal choice and faith. The college administration, however, insisted that the hijab was not allowed under the college's dress code. The dispute turned into a heated argument, with the girls accusing the college administration of being biased against Muslims, and the administration accusing the girls of disrupting the college's functioning.\n\n### Saffron protests\n\nThe controversy quickly gained attention on social media, with many people expressing their support for the Muslim girls. However, a group of right-wing activists, who were dressed in saffron robes, started protesting outside the college, demanding that the girls remove the hijabs. The protesters, who were affiliated with a right-wing organization, Sangh Parivar, claimed that the hijab was a symbol of Islamic fundamentalism and that it threatened the country's cultural identity.\n\nThe protests turned violent, with the protesters throwing stones and eggs at the college. The police were called in to maintain order, but they were unable to control the situation. The college administration was forced to close the college temporarily, citing safety concerns.\n\n### Government reaction\n\nThe Karnataka government reacted quickly to the controversy, with the Chief Minister, Basavaraj Bommai, saying that the government would not tolerate any disruption to the college's functioning. The government also stated that the college's dress code was in place to maintain a uniform and secular atmosphere in the college.\n\nThe government's reaction was seen as being in favor of the college administration and the right-wing protesters. Many people felt that the government was being biased against the Muslim girls and that it was trying to suppress their rights.\n\n### Fallout\n\nThe controversy led to widespread protests across the state, with many people expressing their support for the Muslim girls. The protests were peaceful, but they were attended by large crowds. The controversy also led to a heated debate on social media, with many people expressing their opinions on the issue.\n\nThe controversy also led to a prolonged legal battle, with the Muslim girls filing a petition in the High Court of Karnataka, challenging the college's dress code and the government's decision to support the college administration. The case was eventually heard by the Supreme Court of India.\n\n**Petitions in the High Court**\n\n### Religious rights\n\nThe Muslim girls, led by Rubab Shaikh, filed a petition in the High Court of Karnataka, challenging the college's dress code and the government's decision to support the college administration. The petition argued that the hijab was a fundamental right of the Muslim girls and that it was protected by the Constitution.\n\nThe petition also argued that the college's dress code was discriminatory and that it targeted Muslim girls unfairly. The petitioners claimed that the dress code was a violation of their rights under Article 25 of the Constitution, which guarantees the freedom to practice and propagate their religion.\n\n### Government order\n\nThe government responded to the petition by issuing an order that the college's dress code was in place to maintain a uniform and secular atmosphere in the college. The order stated that the hijab was not allowed under the college's dress code and that the Muslim girls would have to remove it.\n\nThe order was seen as being in favor of the college administration and the right-wing protesters. Many people felt that the government was being biased against the Muslim girls and that it was trying to suppress their rights.\n\n### College development committees\n\nThe college administration also formed a committee to look into the issue of the hijab. The committee was composed of teachers and administrators, and it was tasked with recommending a solution to the problem.\n\nThe committee recommended that the Muslim girls be allowed to wear the hijab, but only in a certain manner. The committee suggested that the hijab be worn in a specific way, with the headscarf being worn under the uniform, and the face being visible.\n\nHowever, the Muslim girls rejected the committee's recommendation, saying that it was not acceptable. They argued that the committee's proposal was a compromise and that it did not address their fundamental rights.\n\n### Udupi college and other institutions\n\nThe controversy also affected other institutions in the state, with several colleges and universities imposing a ban on the hijab. The ban was seen as being in favor of the college administration and the right-wing protesters, and it was criticized by many people who felt that it was discriminatory.\n\nThe controversy also led to a debate on the role of education in promoting cultural diversity and tolerance. Many people felt that education should be a place where students can learn about different cultures and traditions, and that it should be a platform for promoting tolerance and understanding.\n\n**High Court verdict**\n\nThe High Court of Karnataka delivered a verdict on the petition filed by the Muslim girls, upholding the college's dress code and the government's decision to support it. The court ruled that the hijab was not a fundamental right and that it was not protected by the Constitution.\n\nThe court's decision was seen as being in favor of the college administration and the right-wing protesters. Many people felt that the court was being biased against the Muslim girls and that it was trying to suppress their rights.\n\nHowever, the court's decision was also seen as being a setback for the Muslim girls, who had been fighting for their right to wear the hijab. The girls vowed to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court of India.\n\n**Supreme Court**\n\nThe Muslim girls, led by Rubab Shaikh, filed a petition in the Supreme Court of India, challenging the High Court's decision and the government's decision to support the college administration. The petition argued that the hijab was a fundamental right of the Muslim girls and that it was protected by the Constitution.\n\nThe Supreme Court heard the petition and delivered a verdict, upholding the High Court's decision. The court ruled that the hijab was not a fundamental right and that it was not protected by the Constitution.\n\nHowever, the court also said that the ban on the hijab was a violation of the girls' right to freedom of expression and religion. The court ordered the government to revisit the dress code and to ensure that it was not discriminatory.\n\n**Violence**\n\nThe controversy led to widespread violence across the state, with several incidents of stone-throwing, egg-throwing, and vandalism reported. The police were called in to maintain order, but they were unable to control the situation.\n\nThe violence was seen as being in favor of the right-wing protesters, who were trying to suppress the Muslim girls' right to wear the hijab. Many people felt that the violence was a reflection of the deep-seated prejudices and biases that existed in the society.\n\n**Reactions**\n\n### Domestic\n\nThe controversy sparked a heated debate in the country, with many people expressing their opinions on the issue. The controversy also sparked a debate on the role of education in promoting cultural diversity and tolerance.\n\nMany people felt that education should be a place where students can learn about different cultures and traditions, and that it should be a platform for promoting tolerance and understanding. Others felt that the controversy was a reflection of the deep-seated prejudices and biases that existed in the society.\n\n### International\n\nThe controversy also sparked a debate internationally, with many people expressing their opinions on the issue.

The MEA said that the government would continue to work towards promoting understanding and tolerance among different communities.\n\n**Impact**\n\nThe controversy had a significant impact on the state, with many educational institutions imposing a ban on the hijab.

The storm caused widespread damage and loss of life in Mauritius, Réunion, and Madagascar, prompting a significant international response.\n\n**Meteorological History**\n\nCyclone Batsirai developed on February 6, 2022, as a tropical disturbance in the Mozambique Channel, approximately 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) east of Madagascar. The disturbance rapidly intensified into a tropical cyclone, with sustained winds of up to 120 kilometers per hour (75 miles per hour) and a central pressure of 950 hectopascals (hPa). The system continued to strengthen, reaching Category 2 status on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.\n\n**Preparations**\n\n### Mauritius\n\nAs Cyclone Batsirai approached Mauritius, the government declared a red alert and ordered evacuations of coastal areas. The National Disaster Management Center (NDMC) activated the country's emergency response system, mobilizing personnel and equipment for search and rescue operations. The Mauritian Meteorological Service issued a cyclone warning, advising residents to expect strong winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surges.\n\n### Madagascar\n\nIn Madagascar, the government also declared a red alert and ordered evacuations of coastal areas. The National Emergency Operations Center (NEOC) activated the country's emergency response system, mobilizing personnel and equipment for search and rescue operations. The Malagasy Meteorological Service issued a cyclone warning, advising residents to expect strong winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surges.\n\n**Impact**\n\n### Mauritius\n\nCyclone Batsirai made landfall in Mauritius on February 8, 2022, bringing with it sustained winds of up to 150 kilometers per hour (93 miles per hour) and heavy rainfall. The storm caused widespread damage to buildings, roads, and infrastructure, with reports of roofs torn off and trees uprooted.

The election was the 14th presidential election in the history of the Republic of Turkey and the 3rd direct presidential election held in the country.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe election was a result of the culmination of several events in the Turkish political landscape. The most recent presidential election in Turkey was held in 2018, where Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was re-elected as President. However, the election was marred by controversy and allegations of irregularities.\n\n### 2018 Elections\n\nThe 2018 Turkish presidential election was held on June 24, 2018. The election was a two-round affair, with the first round held on April 14, 2018, and the second round held on June 24, 2018. In the first round, 25 candidates competed for the presidency, but none of them secured the majority of the votes. The top two candidates, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Selahattin Demirtaş, went on to compete in the second round. Erdoğan won the second round with 52.59% of the votes, while Demirtaş secured 30.64%.\n\nThe election was marked by controversy, with allegations of irregularities and voter suppression. The opposition parties accused the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) of using state resources to influence the outcome of the election.\n\n**Date**\n\n### Discussion on Snap Elections\n\nThe election was initially scheduled to be held in 2023, as per the Turkish Constitution, which requires presidential elections to be held every five years. However, there was speculation that the election might be held earlier, given the ongoing political tensions in the country.\n\nIn January 2023, the Turkish government announced that it would hold snap elections, citing the need for a new government to take office. The opposition parties, however, accused the government of trying to consolidate power and undermine the democratic process.\n\n### Discussion on Postponing Election Date\n\nIn March 2023, the Turkish Constitutional Court ruled that the election could not be held before the scheduled date, citing the need for a stable and secure electoral environment. The ruling was seen as a victory for the opposition parties, which had argued that the election should not be held in the midst of ongoing political unrest.\n\n### Election Calendar\n\nThe election calendar was finalized in April 2023, with the following dates:\n\n* April 30, 2023: Last day for voter registration\n* May 1, 2023: Campaign period begins\n* May 12, 2023: Last day for campaign activities\n* May 14, 2023: Election day\n\n**Electoral System**\n\nThe Turkish presidential election is held using a two-round system, where the top two candidates compete in the second round. The candidate who secures the majority of the votes in the second round is declared the winner.\n\n**Candidates**\n\n### Candidates\n\nA total of 11 candidates competed in the 2023 Turkish presidential election.

The council received a total of 11 nominations, which were submitted by the parties and independent candidates.\n\n**Endorsements**\n\n### Parties and Alliances\n\nThe election saw several alliances and endorsements between parties. The most notable alliance was between Sinan Oğan and Temel Karamollaoğlu, who formed the \"ATA Alliance\". However, the alliance was dissolved in April 2023, after disagreements between the two parties.\n\nRecep Tayyip Erdoğan was endorsed by several parties, including the Justice and Development Party, the Nationalist Movement Party, and the Saadet Party. Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu was endorsed by several parties, including the Republican People's Party, the Democratic Left Party, and the Peoples' Democratic Party.\n\n**Second Round**\n\nThe second round of the election was held on June 2, 2023. The top two candidates, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, competed for the presidency.\n\n### Negotiations by Oğan and Özdağ\n\nSinan Oğan and Temel Karamollaoğlu, the leaders of the ATA Alliance, engaged in negotiations with each other and with other parties in the run-up to the second round. However, the negotiations were unsuccessful, and the alliance was eventually dissolved.\n\n### Dissolution of ATA Alliance\n\nThe ATA Alliance was dissolved in April 2023, after disagreements between Oğan and Karamollaoğlu. The dissolution of the alliance was seen as a blow to Oğan's presidential campaign.\n\n### Endorsement of Erdoğan by Oğan\n\nSinan Oğan endorsed Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in the second round of the election, citing the need for stability and security in the country. The endorsement was seen as a surprise, given the earlier alliance between Oğan and Karamollaoğlu.\n\n### Özdağ's Support for Kılıçdaroğlu\n\nTemel Karamollaoğlu, the leader of the Felicity Party, endorsed Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu in the second round of the election.

However, the debate was ultimately cancelled, citing logistical and security concerns.\n\n**Controversies**\n\nThe election was marked by several controversies, including:\n\n### Erdoğan's Right to Seek Re-election\n\nThere was controversy over Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's right to seek re-election, given the Turkish Constitution's ban on presidential re-election. However, the Constitutional Court ruled that the ban did not apply to Erdoğan, citing his earlier election as Prime Minister in 2011.\n\n### Political Violence\n\nThere were reports of political violence and intimidation in the run-up to the election, with several opposition candidates and supporters being targeted by pro-government groups.\n\n### Erdoğan's Photo on Ballot Paper\n\nRecep Tayyip Erdoğan's photo was featured on the ballot paper in the second round of the election, despite opposition from the opposition parties.

However, the move was seen as an attempt to suppress opposition voices and limit free speech.\n\n### Reporting of the Results\n\nThere was controversy over the reporting of the results of the election, with several opposition parties accusing the government of manipulating the data to favor Erdoğan.\n\n### Azerbaijani and Russian Interference Allegations\n\nThere were allegations of Azerbaijani and Russian interference in the election, with several opposition parties accusing the two countries of seeking to influence the outcome of the election.\n\n**Opinion Polls**\n\nThe opinion polls in the run-up to the election were divided, with several polls showing Recep Tayyip Erdoğan leading Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, while others showed the opposite.\n\n### First Round\n\nThe first round of the election saw a total of 11 candidates competing for the presidency. The results were as follows:\n\n* Recep Tayyip Erdoğan (Justice and Development Party): 29.5%\n* Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu (Republican People's Party): 24.9%\n* Sinan Oğan (Future Party): 15.8%\n* Meral Akşener (Good Party): 10.6%\n* Temel Karamollaoğlu (Felicity Party): 9.2%\n\n### Second Round\n\nThe second round of the election saw a total of two candidates competing for the presidency: Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu.

The victory was attributed to Erdoğan's experience and stability, as well as his ability to rally support from across the country.\n\nHowever, the election was also marked by controversy and allegations of irregularities. The opposition parties accused the government of manipulating the data to favor Erdoğan, while several international observers raised concerns over the democratic process.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe aftermath of the election saw several developments, including:\n\n### Domestic\n\nThe election was seen as a major boost for Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's presidency, with several opposition parties calling for a re-evaluation of their strategy. The government announced several measures to address the country's economic and social challenges, including a new economic package and a series of social reforms.\n\n### International\n\nThe election was watched closely by international observers, with several countries expressing concerns over the democratic process.

He is the second African American to serve on the Court, after Thurgood Marshall, and has been a conservative presence on the bench for over three decades.\n\nEarly life\n\nThomas was born on June 23, 1948, in Pin Point, Georgia, to M.C. Thomas and Leola Williams Thomas. He was the second of three children, and his family lived in a small, rural community near Savannah, Georgia. Thomas's early life was marked by poverty and hardship, but his parents instilled in him a strong sense of values and a commitment to education.\n\nCollege of the Holy Cross and Yale Law School\n\nThomas attended St. Pius X High School in Atlanta, Georgia, where he excelled academically and was an outstanding football player. He was recruited by several colleges, but chose to attend the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts. Thomas graduated from Holy Cross in 1971, with a degree in English literature. He then attended Yale Law School, where he earned his Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree in 1974.\n\nEarly legal career\n\nThomas's early legal career was marked by a series of high-profile jobs. He worked as a law clerk for Judge Howard W. Cannon of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, and later as an associate at the law firm of Covington & Burling. Thomas also worked as a senior trial attorney for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), where he was involved in several high-profile cases.\n\nDistrict of Columbia Court of Appeals\n\nIn 1981, Thomas was appointed as an assistant secretary for civil rights at the U.S. Department of Education. He served in this position for two years, before being appointed as a member of the U.S. Sentencing Commission. Thomas was also a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) in 1987, where he wrote extensively on issues related to civil rights and law.\n\nNomination to the Supreme Court\n\nIn 1990, President George H.W. Bush nominated Thomas to the Supreme Court, to fill the seat vacated by Justice Thurgood Marshall. Thomas's nomination was contentious, due to allegations made by Anita Hill, a former colleague at the EEOC.\n\nAnita Hill accusations\n\nHill alleged that Thomas had made unwanted advances towards her, and had spoken about pornography in a workplace setting. Thomas denied the allegations, and his nomination was eventually confirmed by the Senate in a narrow vote.\n\nSecond hearing\n\nThe Senate held a second hearing to investigate the allegations, but no additional evidence was presented, and Thomas's nomination was eventually confirmed.\n\nSenate votes\n\nThe Senate voted on Thomas's nomination on October 15, 1991. The final vote was 52-48, with several Democrats voting in favor of confirmation.\n\nSupreme Court of the United States\n\nThomas has served on the Supreme Court for over three decades, and has been a conservative presence on the bench. He has written several influential opinions, including United States v. Lopez (1995), which established the authority of Congress to regulate interstate commerce.\n\nGovernment powers and legal structure\n\nThomas has written extensively on issues related to government powers and the legal structure of the United States. He has argued that the Constitution grants broad powers to the federal government, and has been critical of Supreme Court decisions that limit those powers.\n\nCourt precedent\n\nThomas has been critical of the doctrine of stare decisis, which holds that lower courts must follow the decisions of higher courts. He has argued that the Supreme Court should revisit earlier decisions that are no longer consistent with the Constitution.\n\nExecutive power\n\nThomas has been a strong supporter of executive power, and has argued that the President has broad authority to take action in the absence of legislative authority. He has been critical of the Supreme Court's decision in Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer (1952), which limited the President's power to take action in the absence of legislative authority.\n\nFederalism and states' rights\n\nThomas has been a strong supporter of federalism and states' rights, and has argued that the Constitution grants broad powers to the states. He has been critical of Supreme Court decisions that limit the powers of the states, such as Roe v. Wade (1973).\n\nIndividual rights\n\nThomas has written extensively on issues related to individual rights, including free speech, gun rights, and the right to privacy.\n\nFirst Amendment\n\nThomas has been a strong supporter of the First Amendment, and has argued that it grants broad protections for free speech and assembly. He has been critical of Supreme Court decisions that limit those protections, such as United States v. Stevens (2010).\n\nSecond Amendment\n\nThomas has been a strong supporter of the Second Amendment, and has argued that it grants an individual right to bear arms. He has been critical of Supreme Court decisions that limit that right, such as Heller v. District of Columbia (2008).\n\nFourth Amendment\n\nThomas has been critical of the Fourth Amendment, and has argued that it grants broad powers to the police to search and seize property. He has been critical of Supreme Court decisions that limit those powers, such as Riley v. California (2014).\n\nSixth Amendment\n\nThomas has been a strong supporter of the Sixth Amendment, and has argued that it grants broad protections for the right to a fair trial. He has been critical of Supreme Court decisions that limit those protections, such as Crawford v. Washington (2004).\n\nEighth Amendment\n\nThomas has been a strong supporter of the Eighth Amendment, and has argued that it grants broad protections against cruel and unusual punishment. He has been critical of Supreme Court decisions that limit those protections, such as Graham v. Florida (2010).\n\nFourteenth Amendment\n\nThomas has been a strong supporter of the Fourteenth Amendment, and has argued that it grants broad protections for individual rights. He has been critical of Supreme Court decisions that limit those protections, such as Roe v. Wade (1973).\n\nAbortion and family planning\n\nThomas has been a strong opponent of abortion and family planning, and has argued that the Constitution does not grant a right to abortion. He has been critical of Supreme Court decisions that have protected that right, such as Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992).\n\nLGBTQ rights\n\nThomas has been a strong opponent of LGBTQ rights, and has argued that the Constitution does not grant a right to same-sex marriage. He has been critical of Supreme Court decisions that have protected those rights, such as Obergefell v. Hodges (2015).\n\nOral arguments\n\nThomas has been a vocal advocate for oral arguments, and has argued that they provide a critical check on the power of the judiciary. He has been critical of Supreme Court decisions that have limited the availability of oral arguments.\n\nPersonal life\n\nThomas is married to Virginia Thomas, and has two children, Jamal and Gwendolyn. Thomas is a devout Catholic, and has been involved in several charitable organizations.\n\nFamily\n\nThomas's family has been the subject of several media reports, including a profile in The New York Times. Thomas's wife, Virginia, has been involved in several high-profile cases, including the Anita Hill hearings.\n\nReligion\n\nThomas is a devout Catholic, and has spoken publicly about the importance of his faith. He has been involved in several charitable organizations, including the Catholic Legal Immigration Network.\n\nLiterary influences\n\nThomas has cited several literary influences, including Ralph Ellison and James Baldwin. He has spoken publicly about the importance of literature in shaping his views on justice and equality.\n\nMoira Smith allegations\n\nIn 2010, a former colleague of Thomas's alleged that he had made unwanted advances towards her. Thomas denied the allegations, and no further action was taken.\n\nNondisclosure of finances\n\nIn 2011, it was reported that Thomas had failed to disclose his financial holdings, as required by law. Thomas denied any wrongdoing, and eventually disclosed his holdings.\n\nHonors and recognition\n\nThomas has been awarded several honors and recognitions, including the American Bar Association's Thurgood Marshall Award and the Catholic Legal Immigration Network's Pro Bono Award.\n\nIn popular culture\n\nThomas has been the subject of several popular culture references, including a profile in The New Yorker and a mention in the TV show The Simpsons.\n\nWritings\n\nThomas has written several books and articles, including \"My Grandfather's Son: A Memoir\" and \"The Death of Discourse.\"\n\nSee also\n\n* List of Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States\n* List of African American justices of the Supreme Court\n* List of Supreme Court cases during the Warren Court\n* List of Supreme Court cases during the Burger Court\n* List of Supreme Court cases during the Rehnquist Court\n\nFootnotes\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\n* Thomas, C.

The storm was characterized by heavy snowfall, high winds, and extreme cold temperatures, resulting in significant impacts on transportation, energy, and daily life.\n\n# Meteorological history\n\nThe December 2022 North American winter storm was a complex system that developed over the eastern Pacific Ocean on December 21, 2022. A low-pressure system formed over the ocean and began to move northward, eventually reaching the western coast of North America on December 22. As the system moved inland, it interacted with a cold front that had been stalled over the western United States, resulting in a significant winter storm.\n\nThe storm was fueled by a strong jet stream that was located over the western United States, which allowed the system to tap into a large pool of moisture from the Pacific Ocean. This led to heavy snowfall and high winds, particularly in the Rocky Mountain region and the western United States.\n\n# Preparations\n\nAs the storm approached, authorities and emergency management officials began to prepare for the potential impacts. The National Weather Service issued a Winter Storm Watch and later a Winter Storm Warning for several states, including Arizona, Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued a ground stop for several airports in the western United States, and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) announced plans to reduce security screening protocols to minimize delays.\n\nUtility companies also prepared for the storm by pre-staging crews and equipment in anticipation of potential power outages.\n\n# Impact\n\n## Deaths\n\nThe December 2022 North American winter storm resulted in several reported deaths, including:\n\n* A 55-year-old man who died in a car accident on a snow-covered road in Colorado.\n* A 75-year-old woman who died from hypothermia in her home in Utah.\n* A 35-year-old man who died in a snowboarding accident in Arizona.\n\n## Infrastructure\n\n### Flight delays and cancellations\n\nThe storm caused significant disruptions to air travel, with over 2,000 flights canceled or delayed across the United States. The FAA reported that more than 1,000 flights were cancelled at Denver International Airport alone.\n\n### Road closures and crashes\n\nThe storm caused numerous road closures and crashes, particularly in the Rocky Mountain region. The Colorado Department of Transportation reported that over 100 roads were closed due to snow and ice.\n\n### Intra-city transit disruptions\n\nPublic transportation systems in several cities, including Denver and Salt Lake City, were disrupted due to the storm. Buses and light rail trains were cancelled or delayed, and some routes were closed due to snow and ice.\n\n### Inter-city train delays and cancellations\n\nThe storm caused disruptions to inter-city train services, including Amtrak and freight trains. Several trains were delayed or cancelled, and some routes were suspended due to snow and ice.\n\n### Energy emergencies\n\nThe storm caused several energy emergencies, including power outages and gas leaks. The National Grid reported that over 100,000 households were without power in the northeastern United States.\n\n### Power outages\n\nThe storm caused widespread power outages, with over 250,000 households affected in several states, including Arizona, Colorado, and Utah.\n\n## Sports\n\nThe storm caused several sports events to be postponed or cancelled, including:\n\n* The Denver Broncos vs. Kansas City Chiefs NFL game was postponed to January 8, 2023.\n* The Colorado Avalanche vs. Minnesota Wild NHL game was cancelled.\n* The Utah Jazz vs. Los Angeles Lakers NBA game was postponed.\n\n## Corporate and institutional closures\n\nSeveral companies and institutions were forced to close due to the storm, including:\n\n* The University of Colorado Boulder was closed due to snow and ice.\n* The Colorado Department of Motor Vehicles was closed due to inclement weather.\n* Several banks and government offices were closed due to power outages.\n\n## Animals\n\nThe storm caused several animal-related incidents, including:\n\n* A family of deer was trapped in a snowbank in Colorado and had to be rescued by wildlife officials.\n* Several dogs were lost in the storm and had to be found by their owners.\n* A cat was stranded on a roof in Utah and had to be rescued by firefighters.\n\n# Post-storm cold wave\n\n## Rocky Mountain region\n\nThe storm was followed by a significant cold wave in the Rocky Mountain region, with temperatures plummeting to record lows. The National Weather Service reported that temperatures in Denver dropped to -20°F (-29°C), while temperatures in Aspen dropped to -30°F (-34°C).\n\n## Central United States\n\nThe cold wave also affected the central United States, with temperatures dropping to -20°F (-29°C) in several states, including Kansas and Nebraska.\n\n## Eastern United States\n\nThe cold wave also affected the eastern United States, with temperatures dropping to -10°F (-23°C) in several states, including New York and Pennsylvania.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of winter storms in the United States\n* December 2022 North American cold wave\n\n# Notes\n\n* This article is based on reports from various news sources and government agencies.\n* The exact number of deaths and power outages may vary depending on the source.\n\n# References\n\n* None\n\n# External links\n\n* National Weather Service: Winter Storm Warning\n* Federal Aviation Administration: Ground Stop\n* Transportation Security Administration: Reduced Security Screening Protocols\n* Colorado Department of Transportation: Road Closures\n* National Grid: Power Outages", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The bank was founded in 1983 and was headquartered in Santa Clara, California, in the heart of Silicon Valley.\n\nFoundation and early growth\n\nSilicon Valley Bank was founded on October 17, 1983, by Robert W. Fitzpatrick, a former executive at Wells Fargo, and Roger B. Smith, a former executive at Bank of America. The bank's initial capital was $22 million, with Fitzpatrick serving as its first CEO. In the early years, SVB focused on providing financial services to small technology companies and venture capital investors in the Silicon Valley region.\n\nDuring the 1980s, SVB experienced rapid growth, expanding its operations to other areas of California and opening new branches in San Jose, Palo Alto, and San Francisco. The bank's customer base grew to include prominent technology companies such as Intel, Cisco Systems, and Oracle. SVB's success was attributed to its expertise in providing financial services to the technology industry, as well as its innovative approach to banking.\n\nExpansion\n\nIn the 1990s, SVB continued to expand its operations, opening new branches in other states and acquiring several smaller banks. The bank's customer base expanded to include venture capital investors, private equity firms, and other entities that invested in technology companies. SVB also established a robust online banking platform, allowing customers to access their accounts and conduct financial transactions remotely.\n\nIn 1998, SVB acquired the banking operations of East West Bank, a community bank with branches in California and Oregon. The acquisition added $1.2 billion in assets to SVB's balance sheet and expanded its presence in the Pacific Northwest region. In 2000, SVB acquired the banking operations of Pacific National Bank, a small bank with branches in California and Washington. The acquisition added $1.5 billion in assets to SVB's balance sheet and expanded its presence in the Seattle-Tacoma metropolitan area.\n\nOperations in lead-up to collapse\n\nBusiness model\n\nSVB's business model was centered around providing financial services to technology companies and venture capital investors. The bank offered a range of financial products and services, including deposit accounts, loans, and payment processing solutions. SVB's customer base was comprised of small to medium-sized technology companies, as well as venture capital investors and private equity firms.\n\nSVB's deposit base was comprised of cash and cash equivalents, as well as deposits from customers in the technology industry. The bank's loan portfolio was comprised of loans to technology companies, as well as loans to venture capital investors and private equity firms. SVB's payment processing solutions allowed customers to process payments and manage their cash flow.\n\nFacilities\n\nSVB had a network of branches and facilities across the United States, with a presence in California, Oregon, Washington, and other states. The bank's headquarters was located in Santa Clara, California, and it had a robust online banking platform that allowed customers to access their accounts and conduct financial transactions remotely.\n\nAffiliations and community involvement\n\nSVB was a member of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The bank was also a member of the California Bankers Association and the Silicon Valley Chamber of Commerce. SVB was involved in several community development initiatives, including the Silicon Valley Community Development Corporation and the San Jose/Silicon Valley NAACP.\n\nCollapse\n\nOn March 10, 2023, SVB announced that it would be sold to First Citizens Bank, a North Carolina-based bank, for $16.5 billion. The sale was completed on March 19, 2023, and SVB ceased to exist as a separate entity.\n\nThe collapse of SVB was attributed to a combination of factors, including a decline in the bank's stock price, a surge in deposit withdrawals, and a decline in the bank's loan portfolio. In the months leading up to the collapse, SVB had faced increasing pressure from investors and regulators, who were concerned about the bank's financial health and stability.\n\nReferences\n\nWorks cited\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

As the Roman Empire expanded, so too did the scope of surgical practices, which were heavily influenced by Greek and Etruscan traditions.\n\n**History**\n\nThe history of surgery in ancient Rome is a long and varied one, with early evidence of surgical practices dating back to the 8th century BCE. The Romans were known to have performed various types of surgery, including amputations, trephining, and bloodletting. As the Roman Empire grew, so too did the complexity of surgical procedures, with the development of more sophisticated tools and techniques.\n\nOne of the earliest recorded Roman surgeons was the physician Aulus Cornelius Celsus, who wrote a comprehensive medical text known as the \"De Medicina\" in the 1st century CE. Celsus' work covers a wide range of medical topics, including surgery, and provides valuable insights into the surgical practices of the time.\n\n**Tools**\n\nAncient Roman surgeons relied on a variety of tools to perform their work. Some of the most common tools used in surgery during this period include:\n\n### **Cupping vessels**\n\nCupping vessels were used to create suction on the skin, which was believed to draw out \"bad blood\" and aid in the healing process. These vessels were typically made of metal or clay and were attached to the skin using a rubber or leather strap.\n\n### **Chisels and raspatories**\n\nChisels and raspatories were used to remove bone and soft tissue. Chisels were typically made of metal and were used to cut through bone, while raspatories were used to smooth out rough surfaces.\n\n### **Drills and levers**\n\nDrills and levers were used to perform procedures such as trephining and amputations. Drills were typically made of metal and were used to create holes in the skull, while levers were used to apply pressure and manipulate bone.\n\n### **Sa", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The new government, led by Ayatollah Khomeini, imposed strict rules and regulations on women's participation in sports, including football.

These communities were established through colonization, trade, and cultural exchange between the ancient Greeks and the indigenous populations of Africa.\n\nIntroduction\n------------\n\nThe history of African Greeks is a rich and complex one, spanning over two millennia. From the earliest historical colonies in ancient Egypt to the modern-day communities in Ethiopia and Libya, African Greeks have left an indelible mark on the continent's history, culture, and identity. This article will provide an overview of the history and experiences of African Greeks, exploring their interactions with the indigenous populations, their cultural contributions, and their impact on the course of African history.\n\nAncient Egypt\n-------------\n\n### First Historical Colonies\n\nThe first historical colonies of African Greeks were established in ancient Egypt during the 7th century BC. These colonies were primarily established by Greek traders and settlers who were attracted by the wealth and resources of the Egyptian kingdom. The most significant of these colonies was the city of Naucratis, which was founded in 650 BC and became a major center of Greek culture and commerce in Egypt.\n\nNaucratis was a cosmopolitan city, inhabited by Greeks, Egyptians, and other foreign nationals. The city's strategic location on the Mediterranean coast made it an important hub for trade and cultural exchange between Greece and Egypt. The city's inhabitants were known for their advanced knowledge of mathematics, astronomy, and medicine, which they had acquired from their interactions with the Egyptians.\n\n### Hellenistic Times\n\nThe Ptolemaic dynasty, which ruled Egypt from 323 to 30 BC, saw a significant increase in Greek settlement and influence in the country. The Ptolemies were Macedonian Greeks who had been appointed as the rulers of Egypt by Alexander the Great. They encouraged Greek immigration and settlement in Egypt, and many Greeks came to the country to work as administrators, merchants, and soldiers.\n\nDuring the Ptolemaic period, Greek culture became increasingly influential in Egypt.

The film stars Margot Robbie as Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken, with Will Ferrell, Kate McKinnon, America Ferrera, Simu Liu, and Ariana Greenblatt in supporting roles. The film is a live-action adaptation of the iconic fashion doll of the same name and is produced by Mattel Films and Warner Bros. Pictures.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film follows Barbie, a perfect and idealized doll who lives in a world of perfection, where everything is perfect and nothing can go wrong. However, when she leaves her world and enters the real world, she discovers that not everything is as perfect as it seems. She meets Ken, a rugged and imperfect man who is also a doll, and together they embark on a journey of self-discovery and growth.\n\nAs Barbie navigates the complexities of the real world, she begins to question the societal norms and expectations placed upon her. She meets a diverse range of women who challenge her perceptions and inspire her to become more than just a pretty face. Through her experiences, Barbie learns to prioritize her own happiness and well-being over the expectations of others.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Margot Robbie as Barbie\n* Ryan Gosling as Ken\n* Will Ferrell as Alex Willner\n* Kate McKinnon as Gloria\n* America Ferrera as President Flores\n* Simu Liu as Allan\n* Ariana Greenblatt as younger Barbie\n* Ritu Arya as Sasha\n* Alexandra Shipp as SK\n\n**Production**\n\n### Development\n\nThe idea of a live-action Barbie film was first conceived in the 1990s, but it wasn't until 2014 that Warner Bros. Pictures acquired the rights to the property from Mattel. In 2017, it was announced that Amy Schumer would star in and co-produce the film, but she dropped out of the project in 2018. Margot Robbie was eventually cast in the lead role and brought Greta Gerwig on board to direct and co-write the script.\n\n### Writing\n\nGerwig and Baumbach's script for the film was influenced by the classic fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm and the works of feminist philosopher Simone de Beauvoir. The script explores themes of identity, empowerment, and the societal expectations placed upon women.\n\n### Casting\n\nThe casting process for the film was extensive, with Robbie and Gosling being the first to be cast in the lead roles. The supporting cast was then assembled, with Will Ferrell and Kate McKinnon being brought on board to play the roles of Alex Willner and Gloria, respectively.\n\n### Set design\n\nThe film's sets were designed by production designer Sarah Greenwood, who created a world of perfection and fantasy for the film's opening scenes. The sets were then replicated in the real world, with the film's production team using a combination of practical and digital effects to create a seamless transition between the two worlds.\n\n### Costumes, hair, and makeup\n\nThe film's costumes, hair, and makeup were designed by Jacqueline Durran, who created a look that was both glamorous and practical for the film's leads. The costumes were inspired by the classic styles of the 1950s and 1960s, with a modern twist.\n\n### Filming\n\nPrincipal photography for the film began in September 2021 and wrapped in April 2022. The film was shot on a combination of 35mm film and digital cameras, with a mix of practical and digital effects used to bring the film's fantasy elements to life.\n\n### Post-production\n\nPost-production for the film was extensive, with the film's editors working on a tight schedule to meet the film's release date. The film's score was composed by Harry Styles, who created a soundtrack that was both nostalgic and modern.\n\n**Music**\n\nThe film's soundtrack features a range of original songs, including the hit single \"I'm Just Ken\" by Harry Styles. The soundtrack was released in July 2023 and debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart.\n\n**Marketing**\n\nThe film's marketing campaign was extensive, with Warner Bros. Pictures releasing a series of promotional trailers and posters for the film. The campaign was designed to appeal to a wide range of audiences, with a focus on the film's themes of identity and empowerment.\n\n**Release**\n\n### Theatrical\n\nThe film was released in theaters on July 21, 2023, and opened to a wide range of reviews from critics. The film's opening weekend was a commercial success, with the film debuting at number one on the US box office chart.\n\n### \"Barbenheimer\"\n\nThe film's release coincided with the release of the film \"Oppenheimer\" by Christopher Nolan, which was also a commercial success. The two films were referred to as \"Barbenheimer,\" a portmanteau of the names of the two films.\n\n### Home media\n\nThe film was released on home media on September 12, 2023, and debuted at number one on the US DVD and Blu-ray charts.\n\n### Censorship\n\nThe film faced censorship in a number of countries, including Vietnam and the Philippines, where it was banned due to its depiction of LGBTQ+ themes and characters.\n\n#### Vietnam\n\nThe film was banned in Vietnam due to its depiction of a same-sex couple, which was deemed to be a threat to the country's traditional values.\n\n#### The Philippines\n\nThe film was banned in the Philippines due to its depiction of a same-sex couple and its perceived promotion of LGBTQ+ rights.\n\n#### World map drawing and Warner Bros.' statement\n\nThe film's depiction of a world map was criticized by some for its perceived promotion of a \"nine-dash line\" that claimed a large portion of the South China Sea as Chinese territory. Warner Bros. released a statement denying any involvement in the creation of the map and stating that the film was meant to be a work of fiction.\n\n### Religious interpretation and LGBTQ+ themes\n\nThe film faced criticism from some conservative groups for its depiction of LGBTQ+ themes and characters, which were seen as a threat to traditional values and family structures.\n\n#### Pakistan\n\nThe film was criticized by some in Pakistan for its depiction of a same-sex couple, which was deemed to be a threat to the country's traditional values.\n\n#### Middle East\n\nThe film faced criticism in the Middle East for its depiction of LGBTQ+ themes and characters, which were seen as a threat to the region's traditional values.\n\n#### Algeria\n\nThe film was criticized by some in Algeria for its depiction of a same-sex couple, which was deemed to be a threat to the country's traditional values.\n\n**Reception**\n\n### Box office\n\nThe film was a commercial success, with the film grossing over $1 billion at the global box office.\n\n#### United States and Canada\n\nThe film grossed over $400 million in the United States and Canada, with the film debuting at number one on the US box office chart.\n\n#### Other territories\n\nThe film grossed over $600 million in other territories, with the film performing well in countries such as the UK, Australia, and Japan.\n\n### Critical response\n\nThe film received a wide range of reviews from critics, with some praising the film's performances and direction, while others criticized the film's plot and themes.\n\n### Accolades\n\nThe film received a number of awards and nominations, including several Academy Award nominations and a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress for Margot Robbie's performance.\n\n**Themes and analysis**\n\n### Philosophy\n\nThe film explores a range of philosophical themes, including identity, empowerment, and the societal expectations placed upon women.\n\n### Feminism\n\nThe film is a feminist work, exploring the themes of female empowerment and the societal expectations placed upon women.\n\n### Masculinity\n\nThe film also explores the theme of masculinity, with the character of Ken being a traditional masculine figure who is challenged by his experiences in the film.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Barbie (doll)\n* Fashion\n* Identity\n* Empowerment\n* Feminism\n* Masculinity\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The film's script was influenced by the classic fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm and the works of feminist philosopher Simone de Beauvoir.\n* The film's sets were designed by production designer Sarah Greenwood, who created a world of perfection and fantasy for the film's opening scenes.\n* The film's costumes, hair, and makeup were designed by Jacqueline Durran, who created a look that was both glamorous and practical for the film's leads.\n\n**References**\n\n* This article has no references.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

Since the United States was founded, a total of 74 federal judges have died while still serving on the bench. This article provides an overview of the background, political and logistical consequences, and lists of federal judges who have died in active service.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe history of the United States federal judiciary dates back to the Judiciary Act of 1789, which established the Supreme Court and the lower federal courts. Since then, the judiciary has grown to include 13 federal courts of appeals, 94 federal district courts, and numerous specialized courts, including bankruptcy and tax courts. Federal judges serve lifetime appointments, subject to good behavior, which means that they can serve on the bench for many years, even decades. However, this also means that judges are often older when they die, and their deaths can create vacancies on the bench.\n\n**Political consequences**\n\nThe death of a federal judge in active service can have significant political consequences. When a judge dies or retires, the President nominates a successor, who must be confirmed by the Senate. This process can be contentious, especially if the President and the Senate are from different parties. The nomination and confirmation process can be lengthy, and the vacancy can remain open for many months or even years. In some cases, the Senate may refuse to confirm a nominee, or the nominee may withdraw their name from consideration.\n\nThe death of a federal judge can also lead to a shift in the balance of power on the court. For example, if a liberal judge dies, it may create an opportunity for a more conservative judge to be appointed, and vice versa. This can have significant implications for the court's decisions and the direction of the law.\n\n**Logistical consequences**\n\nThe death of a federal judge in active service can also have logistical consequences. When a judge dies, their cases and dockets are reassigned to other judges, which can cause delays and disruptions in the court's proceedings. The court may also need to reschedule hearings and trials, which can be time-consuming and costly.\n\nIn addition, the death of a federal judge can create a vacancy on the bench, which can lead to a shortage of judges in certain districts or circuits. This can make it difficult for the court to manage its workload and ensure that cases are heard in a timely manner.\n\n**Lists**\n\nThe following lists provide details on the federal judges who have died in active service, organized by era:\n\n### 1789–1869\n\n* **Supreme Court**\n\t+ William Smith (1828–1830)\n\t+ John McLean (1829–1861)\n\t+ James Wayne (1835–1867)\n\t+ John McKinley (1837–1852)\n\t+ Peter Daniel (1841–1860)\n\t+ Philip Barbour (1836–1841)\n\t+ Levi Woodbury (1835–1851)\n* **Circuit Courts**\n\t+ James Hall (1825–1831)\n\t+ Henry St. George Tucker (1831–1846)\n\t+ John Minor Botts (1842–1861)\n\t+ John Archibald Campbell (1846–1853)\n\t+ William B.
