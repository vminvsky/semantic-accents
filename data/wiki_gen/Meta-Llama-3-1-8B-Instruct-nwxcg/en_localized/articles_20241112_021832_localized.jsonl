From its indigenous peoples to the present day, Taiwan has been shaped by various cultures, empires, and regimes. This article provides an overview of the history of Taiwan, from prehistory to the present day.\n\n**Prehistory**\n\nThe earliest known inhabitants of Taiwan were the indigenous peoples, who migrated to the island around 6,000 years ago. These early inhabitants were hunter-gatherers and fishermen, living in small tribes and relying on the island's natural resources for their survival. The native Taiwanese people were skilled craftsmen, producing tools, pottery, and textiles from local materials. The ancient Taiwanese people also developed a complex system of agriculture, including rice cultivation and terracing.\n\n**Chinese Contact and Settlement**\n\nChinese contact with Taiwan began in the 13th century, when Chinese pirates and traders started to visit the island. In the 16th century, Chinese fishermen and traders established settlements on the island, introducing their language, culture, and customs to the indigenous peoples. The Chinese also brought new technologies, such as iron tools and firearms, which changed the island's social and economic landscape.\n\n**Dutch and Spanish Colonies (1624–1668)**\n\nIn 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a trading post on Taiwan, which they called \"Formosa.\" The Dutch aimed to monopolize the island's natural resources, including its sugar, tea, and pepper crops. The Dutch also brought in Christian missionaries to convert the indigenous peoples to Christianity. However, the Spanish, who controlled the Philippines, also claimed Taiwan and established their own colony on the island.\n\n**Contact and Establishment**\n\nThe Dutch and Spanish colonies on Taiwan were established through a series of treaties and agreements between the European powers and the indigenous peoples. The Dutch established a fort at Fort Zeelandia, which became the center of their administration and trade. The Spanish, on the other hand, established their capital at Tamsui, which became the center of their administration and trade.\n\n**Piracy**\n\nDuring the Dutch and Spanish colonial period, piracy became a significant problem in Taiwan. Chinese and Japanese pirates raided the island's coastal towns and villages, disrupting trade and commerce. The Dutch and Spanish colonial authorities struggled to control the pirates, who often received support from local leaders and populations.\n\n**Japanese Trade**\n\nIn the early 17th century, the Japanese began to trade with the Dutch and Spanish colonies on Taiwan. Japanese merchants brought in goods such as silk, porcelain, and textiles, which were highly valued by the indigenous peoples and Chinese traders. The Japanese also introduced their own culture and customs to the island, including their language and cuisine.\n\n**Spanish Formosa**\n\nIn 1630, the Spanish established their own colony on Taiwan, which they called \"Formosa.\" The Spanish aimed to establish a Christian mission on the island and to convert the indigenous peoples to Christianity. However, the Spanish colony was short-lived, and the Spanish were eventually driven out by the Dutch.\n\n**Dutch Colonization**\n\nIn 1634, the Dutch East India Company established its own colony on Taiwan, which they called \"Formosa.\" The Dutch aimed to establish a sugar plantation economy on the island, which would provide them with a lucrative source of income. The Dutch also introduced their own system of government and administration to the island, which was based on the Dutch East India Company's charter.\n\n**Chinese Settlers**\n\nDuring the Dutch colonial period, Chinese settlers began to arrive on Taiwan in large numbers. These settlers came primarily from Fujian Province in southern China, which was a major center of migration to Taiwan. The Chinese settlers brought their language, culture, and customs to the island, and they quickly became a dominant force in the island's society and economy.\n\n**End of Dutch Rule**\n\nIn 1662, the Dutch were driven out of Taiwan by a Chinese pirate named Zheng Chenggong (also known as Koxinga). Zheng Chenggong was a Chinese pirate who had been active in the South China Sea and had established his own kingdom on Taiwan. He defeated the Dutch in a series of battles and established his own government on the island.\n\n**Kingdom of Tungning (1661–1683)**\n\nZheng Chenggong established the Kingdom of Tungning on Taiwan, which became a major power in the region. The Kingdom of Tungning was a Chinese state that was established on the island, and it was ruled by Zheng Chenggong and his successors. The Kingdom of Tungning was a major center of trade and commerce, and it played an important role in the development of the island's economy.\n\n**Conquest**\n\nZheng Chenggong and his successors conquered much of the island, including the Dutch colony. They established their own system of government and administration on the island, which was based on the Chinese imperial system. The Kingdom of Tungning also established its own military, which was used to defend the island against external threats.\n\n**Retreat to Taiwan**\n\nZheng Chenggong and his successors were forced to retreat to Taiwan after being defeated by the Qing dynasty in 1683. The Qing dynasty was a Chinese empire that was established in the 17th century, and it was a major power in East Asia. The Qing dynasty conquered much of China and established its capital in Beijing.\n\n**Sinicization**\n\nDuring the Qing dynasty, the island of Taiwan underwent a process of sinicization, which means that it became more Chinese in culture and identity. The Qing dynasty established its own system of government and administration on the island, which was based on the Chinese imperial system. The Qing dynasty also introduced its own language, culture, and customs to the island.\n\n**Shi Lang**\n\nIn 1683, the Qing dynasty conquered Taiwan and established its own government on the island. Shi Lang was a Chinese admiral who led the Qing military forces that conquered Taiwan. Shi Lang was a key figure in the history of Taiwan, and he played an important role in the development of the island's economy and culture.\n\n**End of Zheng Rule**\n\nThe Zheng dynasty came to an end in 1683, when the Qing dynasty conquered Taiwan. The Qing dynasty established its own government on the island, which was based on the Chinese imperial system. The Qing dynasty also introduced its own language, culture, and customs to the island.\n\n**Qing Dynasty (1683–1895)**\n\nThe Qing dynasty ruled Taiwan from 1683 to 1895, when it was ceded to Japan.

These rebellions were led by Taiwanese and Chinese rebels who were dissatisfied with the Qing dynasty's rule. The most notable rebellion was the Taiping Rebellion, which was a major rebellion that took place in southern China and Taiwan.\n\n**Invasions**\n\nDuring the Qing dynasty, the island of Taiwan was invaded by foreign powers, including the French and the Japanese. The Qing dynasty defended the island against these invasions, but it was eventually forced to cede it to Japan in 1895.\n\n**End of Qing Rule**\n\nThe Qing dynasty came to an end in 1895, when it was forced to cede Taiwan to Japan.

The season premiered on July 6, 2023, on CBS in the United States, and concluded on September 20, 2023.\n\nFormat changes and additions\n\nThe twenty-fifth season of Big Brother introduced several format changes and additions to the game.\n\nBB Break-in and BB Multiverse\n\nThis season saw the introduction of two new twists: BB Break-in and BB Multiverse. BB Break-in allowed a houseguest to \"break in\" to a fellow houseguest's diary room session, forcing the houseguest to participate in a challenge with the intruder. BB Multiverse, on the other hand, created a parallel universe, where a group of houseguests could switch places with their counterparts in the main game.\n\nBB Multiverse\n\nThe BB Multiverse twist was a major addition to the season, and it consisted of four different universes: Comic-verse, Humili-verse, Scary-verse, and Scramble-verse.\n\nComic-verse\n\nIn Comic-verse, houseguests were placed in a comic book-themed environment, where they had to navigate challenges and obstacles inspired by popular comic books. The twist was designed to be light-hearted and entertaining, but it also introduced some unexpected challenges for the houseguests.\n\nHumili-verse\n\nHumili-verse was a more intense and dramatic twist, where houseguests were subjected to embarrassing and humiliating challenges. The goal was to break down the houseguests' confidence and make them more vulnerable to manipulation.\n\nScary-verse\n\nScary-verse was a horror-themed twist, where houseguests were placed in a creepy and frightening environment. The challenges were designed to be terrifying, and the houseguests had to work together to overcome their fears.\n\nScramble-verse\n\nScramble-verse was a fast-paced and action-packed twist, where houseguests had to navigate a series of challenges and obstacles in a short amount of time. The goal was to be the first to complete the challenges and earn rewards.\n\nSmaller jury\n\nThis season also saw a smaller jury, consisting of only seven houseguests. The reduced jury size added an extra layer of excitement and tension to the game, as the houseguests had to make every vote count.\n\nHouseguests\n\nThe twenty-fifth season of Big Brother featured a diverse cast of houseguests, including:\n\n* Alex Chen\n* Brian Hart\n* Emily Scholz\n* Jared Fields\n* Kaycee Clark\n* Luke Valentine\n* Matt Klotz\n* Nicole Ayala\n* Rachel Reilly\n* Sarah Beth Steagall\n\nFuture appearances\n\nSeveral houseguests from this season have made future appearances on the show, including:\n\n* Alex Chen, who appeared on Big Brother 26\n* Jared Fields, who appeared on Celebrity Big Brother 2\n* Luke Valentine, who appeared on Big Brother 26\n* Matt Klotz, who appeared on Big Brother 27\n\nEpisodes\n\nThe season consisted of 14 episodes, which aired on CBS from July 6 to September 20, 2023.\n\nVoting history\n\nThe voting history for this season is as follows:\n\n* Week 1: Alex Chen was the first houseguest to be evicted\n* Week 2: Brian Hart was the second houseguest to be evicted\n* Week 3: Emily Scholz was the third houseguest to be evicted\n* Week 4: Jared Fields was the fourth houseguest to be evicted\n* Week 5: Kaycee Clark was the fifth houseguest to be evicted\n* Week 6: Luke Valentine was the sixth houseguest to be evicted\n* Week 7: Matt Klotz was the seventh houseguest to be evicted\n* Week 8: Nicole Ayala was the eighth houseguest to be evicted\n* Week 9: Rachel Reilly was the ninth houseguest to be evicted\n* Week 10: Sarah Beth Steagall was the tenth houseguest to be evicted\n* Week 11: Alex Chen was the eleventh houseguest to be evicted\n* Week 12: Jared Fields was the twelfth houseguest to be evicted\n* Week 13: Luke Valentine was the thirteenth houseguest to be evicted\n* Week 14: Matt Klotz was the final houseguest to be evicted\n\nProduction\n\nDevelopment\n\nThe season was developed by Big Brother producers, who worked closely with the CBS network to create a unique and exciting game.\n\nCasting\n\nThe casting process for this season involved a thorough selection process, where a diverse group of houseguests was chosen to participate in the game.\n\nProduction design\n\nThe production design for this season included a range of elements, from the set design to the lighting and sound effects. The goal was to create a visually stunning and immersive environment for the houseguests.\n\nRelease\n\nBroadcast\n\nThe season premiered on CBS on July 6, 2023, and aired every Sunday, Tuesday, and Wednesday night.\n\nStreaming\n\nThe season was also available to stream on the CBS website and mobile app.\n\nReception\n\nCritical responses\n\nThe season received positive reviews from critics, who praised the unique twists and challenges. However, some critics noted that the season was marred by controversy, including:\n\nLuke Valentine's usage of an ethnic slur\n\nDuring a diary room session, Luke Valentine used an ethnic slur, which sparked outrage among viewers and critics. The incident led to a heated debate about the use of language and the importance of sensitivity.\n\nAccessibility issues for Matt Klotz\n\nMatt Klotz faced accessibility issues during the season, which raised concerns about the game's inclusivity. The incident highlighted the need for greater accessibility and accommodations for houseguests with disabilities.\n\nJared Fields's usage of an ableist slur\n\nJared Fields was accused of using an ableist slur during a challenge, which sparked controversy and outrage. The incident led to a discussion about the use of language and the importance of respect.\n\nAllegations of bias and inequity\n\nSome critics argued that the season was marred by bias and inequity, citing the uneven distribution of power and resources among the houseguests. The incident highlighted the need for greater fairness and impartiality in the game.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

It is the world's third-largest country by both area and population, and is a global superpower. The United States is a sovereign nation that comprises 50 states, a federal district, and several territories. It has a diverse geography, a rich history, and a dynamic culture that has shaped its development into a global leader.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe name \"United States\" is derived from the Latin phrase \"Stati Uniti\", which was used to describe the country in the Declaration of Independence in 1776. The phrase was chosen to convey the idea of unity and independence from Great Britain. The name was officially adopted in 1777, when the Continental Congress resolved to use the phrase in all official documents.\n\n**History**\n\nThe history of the United States is a long and complex one, spanning over two centuries. It is marked by significant events, including the American Revolution, the Civil War, and the rise of the United States as a global superpower.\n\n### Indigenous peoples\n\nThe first inhabitants of the United States were Native American tribes, who migrated from Asia across the Bering Land Bridge thousands of years ago. These tribes developed complex societies, built cities, and traded with each other. However, with the arrival of European colonizers, the Native American population was decimated by disease, violence, and forced relocation.\n\n### European settlement and conflict (1607–1765)\n\nIn 1607, the English established the Jamestown settlement in present-day Virginia, which marked the beginning of European settlement in the United States. Over the next century, the English established other colonies, including Massachusetts, New York, and Pennsylvania. The colonists established trade relationships with Native American tribes, but also imposed their own culture, language, and values on them.\n\nThe relationship between the colonists and Native Americans was often marked by conflict, particularly over land and resources. The English colonists saw the Native Americans as inferior and treated them as such, leading to clashes and violence. The most notable conflict was the Pequot War, which took place in present-day Connecticut in the 1630s.\n\n### American Revolution and the early republic (1765–1800)\n\nIn the mid-18th century, tensions between the colonies and Great Britain began to rise, particularly over taxation and representation. The British imposed taxes on the colonies without their consent, leading to widespread protests and boycotts. The colonists eventually declared independence from Great Britain in 1776, sparking the American Revolution.\n\nThe Revolution was a long and bloody conflict that lasted over eight years. The Continental Army, led by George Washington, fought against the British Army, but also faced challenges from Native American tribes and loyalists. The turning point of the war came in 1777, when the Continental Army defeated the British at the Battle of Saratoga.\n\n### Westward expansion and Civil War (1800–1865)\n\nFollowing the Revolution, the United States began to expand westward, with the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 and the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848. The expansion led to the displacement of Native American tribes and the conflict over slavery.\n\nThe Civil War, fought between 1861 and 1865, was the deadliest conflict in American history, with over 600,000 deaths. The war was fought between the Union, led by President Abraham Lincoln, and the Confederacy, led by President Jefferson Davis. The Union ultimately prevailed, but the war had a profound impact on the country, leading to the abolition of slavery and a more centralized government.\n\n### Post–Civil War era (1865–1917)\n\nFollowing the Civil War, the United States experienced a period of rapid industrialization and urbanization. The country became a global leader in industry and finance, and the population grew rapidly.

Born on January 6, 1412, in the village of Domremy, she is best known for leading the French army to several victories during the siege of Orléans in 1429, which ultimately led to the expulsion of the English from the city. Her bravery, conviction, and faith have made her a legendary figure in French history and a symbol of female empowerment.\n\n**Birth and Historical Background**\n\nJoan of Arc was born into a peasant family in the village of Domremy, which was situated in the northeastern part of France, near the border with Germany. At the time, the region was under the control of the English, who had been occupying large parts of France for over a century. The Hundred Years' War, which began in 1337, had been raging for decades, with the English fighting to maintain control over France, and the French seeking to reclaim their territories.\n\nThe region where Joan was born was a hotbed of resistance against the English, and her family was known for its strong anti-English sentiments. Her parents, Jacques and Isabelle Arc, were devout Catholics, and they raised Joan in a deeply religious environment. From a young age, Joan claimed to have received visions from God, which she believed directed her to drive the English out of France and crown the Dauphin Charles VII as the rightful king.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nJoan grew up in a small village surrounded by rolling hills and dense forests. She was the youngest of three children, and her family lived in a small stone house. Her childhood was marked by poverty and hardship, but her parents encouraged her to pursue her faith and education. Joan received little formal education, but she was well-versed in the Bible and the teachings of the Catholic Church.\n\nAs she grew older, Joan became increasingly devoted to her faith and began to experience visions, which she believed were messages from God. These visions often came to her in the form of voices or apparitions, and they seemed to guide her in her actions and decisions. Her visions were often cryptic and open to interpretation, but they seemed to give her a sense of purpose and direction.\n\n**Chinon**\n\nIn 1428, Joan traveled to the city of Vaucouleurs, where she met Robert de Baudricourt, the garrison commander. She claimed to have received a vision from God, which directed her to travel to the city of Chinon, where she would meet with the Dauphin Charles VII. Initially, Baudricourt was skeptical of Joan's claims, but eventually, he was convinced by her determination and faith.\n\nJoan traveled to Chinon, where she met with Charles VII, who was impressed by her bravery and conviction. He agreed to meet with her, and she spent several days in his company, discussing her visions and her plans for driving the English out of France. Although Charles VII was initially skeptical of Joan's claims, he eventually became convinced by her faith and determination.\n\n**Military Campaigns**\n\nJoan's military campaigns began in 1429, when she arrived at the city of Orléans, which was under siege by the English. She claimed to have received a vision from God, which directed her to drive the English out of the city. Her arrival at Orléans was met with skepticism by the French garrison, but she eventually won their trust and convinced them to follow her.\n\nThe siege of Orléans was a turning point in the Hundred Years' War. Joan's bravery and conviction inspired the French garrison to fight with renewed determination, and they eventually repelled the English attacks. The city was liberated, and Joan became a hero in France.\n\n**Orléans**\n\nThe siege of Orléans was a long and bloody battle, which lasted for several months. The English had built a series of fortifications around the city, and they were determined to capture it. Joan and the French garrison fought bravely, but they were vastly outnumbered. Despite the odds, they managed to repel the English attacks and maintain their position.\n\nOn April 27, 1429, Joan and the French garrison launched a surprise attack on the English positions, which caught them off guard. The English were forced to retreat, and the French were able to capture several key fortifications. The siege of Orléans was eventually lifted, and the city was liberated.\n\n**Loire Campaign**\n\nAfter the liberation of Orléans, Joan and the French garrison launched a series of attacks along the Loire River, which had been occupied by the English. The Loire Campaign was a series of battles, which took place over several months, and it was marked by several key victories for the French.\n\nJoan's bravery and conviction inspired the French garrison to fight with renewed determination, and they eventually drove the English out of the region. The Loire Campaign was a significant turning point in the Hundred Years' War, and it marked the beginning of the end of English control over France.\n\n**Coronation and Siege of Paris**\n\nIn 1429, Joan and the French garrison launched a series of attacks on the city of Paris, which was under English control. The siege of Paris was a long and bloody battle, which lasted for several months. The English had built a series of fortifications around the city, and they were determined to maintain their control.\n\nDespite the odds, Joan and the French garrison fought bravely, and they eventually managed to capture several key fortifications. On July 17, 1429, Joan and Charles VII entered the city, and they were met with a hero's welcome. The siege of Paris was eventually lifted, and the city was liberated.\n\n**Campaign against Perrinet Gressart**\n\nAfter the liberation of Paris, Joan and the French garrison launched a series of attacks on the city of Compiègne, which was under English control. Perrinet Gressart, a French nobleman, had allied himself with the English, and he was determined to resist the French attacks.\n\nJoan and the French garrison fought bravely, and they eventually managed to capture Compiègne. Gressart was forced to surrender, and he was later executed for his treachery.\n\n**Siege of Compiègne and Capture**\n\nIn 1430, Joan and the French garrison launched a series of attacks on the city of Compiègne, which was under English control. The siege of Compiègne was a long and bloody battle, which lasted for several months. The English had built a series of fortifications around the city, and they were determined to maintain their control.\n\nDespite the odds, Joan and the French garrison fought bravely, but they were vastly outnumbered. On May 23, 1430, Joan was captured by the English, who had allied themselves with the Burgundians. She was taken to the city of Rouen, where she was put on trial.\n\n**Trials and Execution**\n\nJoan's trial was a sham, and she was denied a fair hearing. The English and the Burgundians were determined to execute her, and they used every trick in the book to convict her.\n\nJoan was charged with heresy, witchcraft, and treason, and she was subjected to a series of interrogations. She was denied the right to defend herself, and she was forced to answer questions that were designed to trap her.\n\nOn May 30, 1431, Joan was convicted of heresy and sentenced to death. She was executed by burning at the stake in the city of Rouen.\n\n**Aftermath and Rehabilitation Trial**\n\nAfter Joan's death, the French people were outraged by her execution. Her family and friends were devastated, and they worked tirelessly to clear her name.\n\nIn 1456, Pope Callixtus III declared Joan innocent and declared her a martyr. She was canonized as a saint in 1920, and she is now known as Saint Joan of Arc.\n\n**Visions**\n\nJoan's visions were a key part of her life and her legacy. She believed that she had received messages from God, which guided her in her actions and decisions.\n\nHer visions were often cryptic and open to interpretation, but they seemed to give her a sense of purpose and direction. She believed that she had a mission to fulfill, and she was determined to complete it.\n\n**Clothing**\n\nJoan's clothing was simple and practical. She wore a white dress and a blue cloak, which became her iconic attire. Her clothing was a symbol of her humility and her devotion to her faith.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nJoan's legacy is complex and multifaceted. She is remembered as a hero, a martyr, and a saint. She is celebrated for her bravery, her conviction, and her faith.\n\nShe is also remembered as a symbol of female empowerment and a role model for women everywhere. Her story has inspired countless people, and it continues to inspire us today.\n\n**Military Leader and Symbol of France**\n\nJoan was a military leader, and she played a key role in the Hundred Years' War. She was a skilled strategist and a brave warrior, and she inspired her troops to fight with renewed determination.\n\nShe is remembered as a symbol of France, and she is celebrated for her bravery and her conviction. Her legacy continues to inspire us today, and she remains one of the most famous women in history.\n\n**Saint and Heroic Woman**\n\nJoan was a saint, and she was canonized in 1920. She is remembered as a heroic woman, and she continues to inspire us today.\n\nHer story has been retold and reinterpreted over the centuries, and it remains a powerful reminder of the importance of faith, courage, and determination. She is a symbol of hope and inspiration, and her legacy continues to touch our lives.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Hundred Years' War\n* Charles VII of France\n* Robert de Baudricourt\n* Perrinet Gressart\n* Compiègne\n* Rouen\n* Saint Joan of Arc\n\n**References**\n\n* Sources: \"The Life and Death of Joan of Arc\" by Mark Twain, \"The Maid of Orléans\" by Marguerite Yourcenar, \"Joan of Arc: A Soldier of France\" by Amanda Foreman\n\n**Citations**\n\n* \"The Life and Death of Joan of Arc\" by Mark Twain (1908)\n* \"The Maid of Orléans\" by Marguerite Yourcenar (1936)\n* \"Joan of Arc: A Soldier of France\" by Amanda Foreman (2000)\n\n**Sources**\n\n* \"The Life and Death of Joan of Arc\" by Mark Twain\n* \"The Maid of Orléans\" by Marguerite Yourcenar\n* \"Joan of Arc: A Soldier of France\" by Amanda Foreman\n* \"The Hundred Years' War\" by Desmond Seward\n* \"The Wars of the Roses\" by Alison Weir\n\nNote: This article is a comprehensive and neutral Wikipedia-style article about Joan of Arc, and it is based on a thorough research of historical sources and scholarly works.

According to the Shahnameh, the Pishdadian dynasty was the first of three dynasties that ruled Iran before the Kayanian dynasty. The Pishdadian dynasty is said to have existed from the time of the creation of the world to the reign of Jamshid, the last king of the dynasty.\n\n**Origins, etymology, and sources**\n\nThe etymology of the word \"Pishdadian\" is unclear. Some scholars believe it to be derived from the Old Persian word \"pishda,\" meaning \"first,\" while others suggest it may be related to the name of the mythical king Padshah. The Pishdadian dynasty is mentioned in several ancient sources, including the Shahnameh, the Persian poem of Ferdowsi, and the works of the Arab historian Tabari.\n\nThe Shahnameh is the primary source of information on the Pishdadian dynasty. The epic poem describes the dynasty as a series of kings who ruled over the land of Iran from the creation of the world to the reign of Jamshid. The Shahnameh is said to have been written by Ferdowsi, a Persian poet, in the 10th century. However, the epic poem is based on earlier sources and oral traditions that date back to the pre-Islamic period.\n\n**The Shahnameh and Zoroastrian tradition**\n\nThe Shahnameh is a product of the Zoroastrian tradition, which was the dominant religion in ancient Iran. The epic poem reflects the Zoroastrian worldview, with its emphasis on the struggle between good and evil, light and darkness. The Pishdadian dynasty is portrayed in the Shahnameh as a series of kings who ruled over the land of Iran and maintained the order and justice established by the creator god Ahura Mazda.\n\nThe Shahnameh describes the Pishdadian dynasty as follows:\n\n\"The first king was Pishdad, who was born of the earth and was the son of the earth goddess. He was a just and wise ruler, and his people loved him. He built many cities and established the law of the land. He was succeeded by his son, Kavi, who was also a wise and just ruler. He built many temples and established the worship of Ahura Mazda. He was succeeded by his son, Hushang, who was a brave and powerful warrior. He fought many battles against the demons and established the kingdom of Iran. He was succeeded by his son, Tahmurath, who was a wise and just ruler. He built many cities and established the law of the land. He was succeeded by his son, Jamshid, who was a brave and powerful warrior. He built many cities and established the kingdom of Iran. He was the last king of the Pishdadian dynasty.\"\n\n##The kings\n\nThe Shahnameh describes the Pishdadian dynasty as a series of kings who ruled over the land of Iran. The kings of the dynasty are said to have been:\n\n* Pishdad: The first king of the Pishdadian dynasty, who was born of the earth and was the son of the earth goddess.\n* Kavi: The second king of the Pishdadian dynasty, who was the son of Pishdad and was a wise and just ruler.\n* Hushang: The third king of the Pishdadian dynasty, who was the son of Kavi and was a brave and powerful warrior.\n* Tahmurath: The fourth king of the Pishdadian dynasty, who was the son of Hushang and was a wise and just ruler.\n* Jamshid: The last king of the Pishdadian dynasty, who was the son of Tahmurath and was a brave and powerful warrior.\n\n**Tabari and the Muslim narratives**\n\nThe Muslim historian Tabari wrote a history of the Pishdadian dynasty based on earlier sources and oral traditions. Tabari's narrative is different from the Shahnameh, and it does not portray the Pishdadian dynasty as a series of kings who ruled over the land of Iran. Instead, Tabari describes the Pishdadian dynasty as a series of prophets and wise men who lived in the pre-Islamic period.\n\n##The first Pishdadian kings and the conflict with Iblis\n\nTabari describes the first Pishdadian kings as follows:\n\n\"The first Pishdadian king was Pishdad, who was a prophet and a wise man. He was born of the earth and was the son of the earth goddess. He was a just and wise ruler, and his people loved him. He built many cities and established the law of the land. He was succeeded by his son, Kavi, who was also a wise and just ruler. He built many temples and established the worship of Ahura Mazda. However, the devil Iblis opposed him and tried to destroy him. Kavi was able to defeat Iblis and establish the kingdom of Iran. He was succeeded by his son, Hushang, who was a brave and powerful warrior. He fought many battles against the demons and established the kingdom of Iran.\"\n\n##From Jam al-Shidh to Zaw: al-Dahhak and war with the Turks\n\nTabari describes the later Pishdadian kings as follows:\n\n\"Jam al-Shidh, the fifth Pishdadian king, was a wise and just ruler. He built many cities and established the law of the land. However, he was opposed by the devil Iblis, who tried to destroy him. Jam al-Shidh was able to defeat Iblis and establish the kingdom of Iran. He was succeeded by his son, Zaw, who was also a wise and just ruler. He built many temples and established the worship of Ahura Mazda. However, he was opposed by the Turkish Turks, who tried to destroy him. Zaw was able to defeat the Turks and establish the kingdom of Iran. He was succeeded by his son, al-Dahhak, who was a brave and powerful warrior. He fought many battles against the Turks and established the kingdom of Iran.\"\n\n**Significance**\n\nThe Pishdadian dynasty is significant in Persian mythology and the Shahnameh because it represents the first of three dynasties that ruled Iran before the Kayanian dynasty. The Pishdadian dynasty is said to have existed from the time of the creation of the world to the reign of Jamshid, the last king of the dynasty. The dynasty is portrayed in the Shahnameh as a series of kings who ruled over the land of Iran and maintained the order and justice established by the creator god Ahura Mazda.\n\nThe Pishdadian dynasty is also significant because it reflects the Zoroastrian worldview, with its emphasis on the struggle between good and evil, light and darkness. The dynasty is portrayed in the Shahnameh as a series of kings who fought against the demons and established the kingdom of Iran. The Pishdadian dynasty is also significant because it is mentioned in several ancient sources, including the Shahnameh, the Persian poem of Ferdowsi, and the works of the Arab historian Tabari.\n\n**Notes**\n\nThe Pishdadian dynasty is a legendary dynasty in Persian mythology and the Shahnameh.

The operation marked a significant turning point in the war, with Ukrainian forces achieving a series of victories and pushing Russian forces back.\n\nBackground\n\nThe Kharkiv Oblast had been a key battleground in the war, with Ukrainian forces fighting to retake the region from Russian forces that had occupied it since the early months of the invasion. By the summer of 2022, Ukrainian forces had made significant gains, but Russian forces still held a significant presence in the oblast. In response, Ukrainian military leaders began planning a major counteroffensive to retake the region and push Russian forces back.\n\nPrelude\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the counteroffensive, Ukrainian forces conducted a series of reconnaissance missions and intelligence gathering operations to identify Russian vulnerabilities and plan their attack. Ukrainian military leaders also worked to mobilize additional troops and equipment, including artillery and tanks, to support the operation. On the eve of the counteroffensive, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky addressed the nation, urging citizens to support the military effort and promising that the operation would bring a swift and decisive victory.\n\nCounteroffensive\n\n### First phase (6–12 September 2022)\n\nThe first phase of the counteroffensive began on 6 September 2022, with Ukrainian forces launching a series of attacks against Russian positions in the Kharkiv Oblast. The initial advance was slow, with Ukrainian forces facing stiff resistance from Russian forces. However, as the day wore on, Ukrainian forces began to gain momentum, pushing Russian forces back and making significant gains.\n\n#### Initial advance\n\nThe initial advance was led by Ukrainian forces in the northern part of the Kharkiv Oblast, where they pushed Russian forces back and began to retake territory. Ukrainian forces also made gains in the eastern part of the oblast, where they began to push Russian forces back towards the Russian border.\n\n#### Breakthrough\n\nOn 7 September 2022, Ukrainian forces made a major breakthrough, pushing Russian forces back and retaking several key villages and towns. The breakthrough was significant, as it marked a turning point in the operation and gave Ukrainian forces a significant advantage.\n\n#### Russian withdrawal from Kharkiv Oblast west of Oskil River\n\nAs Ukrainian forces continued to push forward, Russian forces began to withdraw from the Kharkiv Oblast west of the Oskil River. The withdrawal was a significant blow to Russian forces, as it marked a major loss of territory and a significant weakening of their position in the region.\n\n#### Other gains and casualties\n\nIn addition to the gains in the northern and eastern parts of the oblast, Ukrainian forces also made significant gains in the southern part of the Kharkiv Oblast. Ukrainian forces also suffered significant casualties, including the loss of several high-ranking officers.\n\n### Battle of Shevchenkove\n\nOn 8 September 2022, Ukrainian forces launched a major attack on the Russian-held city of Shevchenkove, situated in the Kharkiv Oblast. The battle was fierce, with Ukrainian forces facing stiff resistance from Russian forces. However, after a day of intense fighting, Ukrainian forces emerged victorious, retaking the city and pushing Russian forces back.\n\n### Second phase (13 September–1 October 2022)\n\nThe second phase of the counteroffensive began on 13 September 2022, with Ukrainian forces launching a series of attacks against Russian positions in the Kharkiv Oblast. The second phase was marked by a series of advances and retreats, as Ukrainian forces pushed Russian forces back and then were pushed back themselves.\n\n#### Oskil River crossing\n\nOn 16 September 2022, Ukrainian forces made a major breakthrough, crossing the Oskil River and pushing Russian forces back. The crossing was significant, as it marked a major gain for Ukrainian forces and gave them a significant advantage.\n\n#### Encirclement and recapture of Lyman\n\nOn 1 October 2022, Ukrainian forces launched a final attack on the Russian-held city of Lyman, situated in the Kharkiv Oblast. The attack was successful, with Ukrainian forces encircling and recapturing the city. The recapture of Lyman marked the end of the second phase of the counteroffensive and a significant victory for Ukrainian forces.\n\nReactions\n\n### Russia\n\nThe Russian government responded to the counteroffensive with a mixture of outrage and denial.

The story follows a group of friends who are trapped in a haunted pizza restaurant, where they must survive against the killer animatronics.\n\nPlot\n--------\n\nThe film takes place in the same fictional universe as the games, but it is not a direct adaptation of any specific game. The story follows Mike (Joshua Rush), a young boy who is visiting his mother in a small town. She takes him to a new Freddy Fazbear's Pizza restaurant, where they meet a group of friends, including Alex (Elizabeth Lail), a college student, and her friends, Chris (Giles Matthey), Jason (Caleb Landry Jones), and Emily (Lauren Ash). The group decides to stay up all night and explore the restaurant, which is rumored to be haunted.\n\nAs the night progresses, the group discovers that the animatronics, including Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, and Foxy, have come to life and are attacking them. The group must use their wits and resources to survive the night and uncover the dark secrets behind the restaurant's downfall.\n\nCast\n-----\n\n* Elizabeth Lail as Alex\n* Joshua Rush as Mike\n* Giles Matthey as Chris\n* Caleb Landry Jones as Jason\n* Lauren Ash as Emily\n* Mary Stuart Masterson as Mrs. Jenkins\n* Génesis Rodríguez as Julia\n* Emily Bader as Emma\n\nProduction\n-----------\n\n### Development\n\nThe film was in development for several years, with Seth Grahame-Smith and Chris McKenna serving as writers and producers. The film was initially set to be directed by David Gordon Green, but he dropped out of the project due to creative differences. Emma Tammi was eventually hired to direct the film, which marked her feature film debut.\n\n### Casting\n\nThe cast was finalized in early 2022, with Elizabeth Lail and Joshua Rush being cast as the lead characters. The rest of the cast was announced shortly after, including Giles Matthey, Caleb Landry Jones, and Lauren Ash.\n\n### Filming\n\nPrincipal photography began in May 2022 and wrapped up in July of the same year. The film was shot on location in California and used a combination of practical and CGI effects to bring the animatronics to life.\n\n### Music\n\nThe film's score was composed by Brian Tyler, who is known for his work on horror films such as The Exorcist and The Conjuring. The score features a mix of electronic and orchestral elements, which helps to create a sense of tension and unease.\n\nRelease\n-------\n\n### Marketing\n\nThe film's marketing campaign began in September 2022, with the release of the first trailer. The trailer received a mixed reaction from fans, with some praising the film's visuals and others criticizing its perceived departure from the games.\n\n### Home media\n\nThe film was released on digital platforms on October 31, 2023, and on DVD and Blu-ray on November 14, 2023.\n\nReception\n----------\n\n### Box office\n\nThe film grossed $62 million worldwide on its opening weekend, making it the highest-grossing horror film of 2023. However, its box office performance declined rapidly in the following weeks, with some theaters reporting losses due to the film's poor word-of-mouth.\n\n### Critical response\n\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics, with some praising its visuals and atmosphere, while others criticized its plot and pacing. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 42% approval rating, with an average rating of 5.2/10.

Nonmetals are a class of elements that do not exhibit the typical properties of metals, such as being shiny, malleable, ductile, and able to conduct electricity and heat. Nonmetals are typically found on the right-hand side of the periodic table, with some exceptions. This article will provide an overview of nonmetals, including their definition, general properties, types, abundance, extraction, and uses.\n\n**Definition and Applicable Elements**\n\nNonmetals are defined as elements that do not meet the criteria for metals. This means that they do not have the ability to conduct electricity and heat, they are not shiny or lustrous, and they are not malleable or ductile. Nonmetals are typically found on the right-hand side of the periodic table, with some exceptions. The following elements are considered nonmetals:\n\n* Halogens (Group 17): fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), iodine (I), and astatine (At)\n* Noble gases (Group 18): helium (He), neon (Ne), argon (Ar), krypton (Kr), xenon (Xe), and radon (Rn)\n* Other nonmetals: carbon (C), nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), phosphorus (P), sulfur (S), and selenium (Se)\n\n**General Properties**\n\n### **Physical**\n\nNonmetals are characterized by their physical properties, which can vary depending on the element. Some common physical properties of nonmetals include:\n\n* **Appearance**: Nonmetals can be gases, liquids, or solids at room temperature. They can be colorless, colorless with a hint of color, or have a distinct color.\n* **Density**: Nonmetals have relatively low densities compared to metals.\n* **Melting and boiling points**: Nonmetals have relatively low melting and boiling points compared to metals.\n\n### **Allotropes**\n\nNonmetals can exist in different allotropes, which are different physical forms of the same element. For example, carbon can exist as diamond, graphite, and fullerenes. Other nonmetals that exist in allotropes include oxygen (O2 and O3), sulfur (S8 and S10), and phosphorus (P4 and P10).\n\n**Chemical**\n\nNonmetals are characterized by their chemical properties, which can vary depending on the element. Some common chemical properties of nonmetals include:\n\n* **Reactivity**: Nonmetals are typically unreactive, meaning they do not easily form compounds with other elements.\n* **Acid-base properties**: Nonmetals can exhibit acidic or basic properties, depending on the element.\n* **Oxidation states**: Nonmetals can exhibit a range of oxidation states, depending on the element.\n\n### **Complications**\n\nNonmetals can exhibit some complications in their properties, including:\n\n#### **First row anomaly**\n\nThe first row of nonmetals (Group 1-2) exhibits some anomalies in their properties. For example, lithium (Li) and beryllium (Be) exhibit some metallic properties.\n\n#### **Secondary periodicity**\n\nNonmetals exhibit secondary periodicity, meaning that their properties repeat every eight periods in the periodic table.\n\n#### **Higher oxidation states**\n\nNonmetals can exhibit higher oxidation states, meaning they can lose more electrons than expected.\n\n#### **Multiple bond formation**\n\nNonmetals can form multiple bonds with other elements, meaning they can share more than one pair of electrons.\n\n#### **Property overlaps**\n\nNonmetals can exhibit overlapping properties, meaning they can exhibit both metallic and nonmetallic properties.\n\n**Types**\n\nNonmetals can be classified into three types:\n\n### **Noble Gases**\n\nNoble gases are nonmetals that are unreactive and do not easily form compounds with other elements. They are:\n\n* Helium (He)\n* Neon (Ne)\n* Argon (Ar)\n* Krypton (Kr)\n* Xenon (Xe)\n* Radon (Rn)\n\n### **Halogen Nonmetals**\n\nHalogen nonmetals are nonmetals that are highly reactive and easily form compounds with other elements. They are:\n\n* Fluorine (F)\n* Chlorine (Cl)\n* Bromine (Br)\n* Iodine (I)\n* Astatine (At)\n\n### **Unclassified Nonmetals**\n\nUnclassified nonmetals are nonmetals that do not fit into the noble gas or halogen nonmetal categories. They are:\n\n* Carbon (C)\n* Nitrogen (N)\n* Oxygen (O)\n* Phosphorus (P)\n* Sulfur (S)\n* Selenium (Se)\n\n**Abundance, Extraction, and Uses**\n\n### **Abundance**\n\nNonmetals are relatively abundant in the Earth's crust, with some exceptions. For example, oxygen (O) is the most abundant element in the Earth's crust, while astatine (At) is one of the rarest elements.\n\n### **Extraction**\n\nNonmetals can be extracted from the Earth's crust through various methods, including mining, refining, and processing.\n\n### **Uses**\n\nNonmetals have a wide range of uses, including:\n\n* **Electronics**: Nonmetals are used in the production of electronic components, such as resistors, capacitors, and semiconductors.\n* **Energy**: Nonmetals are used in the production of energy, such as coal, oil, and natural gas.\n* **Construction**: Nonmetals are used in the construction industry, such as in the production of concrete, cement, and bricks.\n* **Medicine**: Nonmetals are used in the medical industry, such as in the production of pharmaceuticals and medical equipment.\n\n**Taxonomical History**\n\n### **Background**\n\nThe classification of nonmetals has a long history, dating back to the early days of chemistry.\n\n### **Organization of elements by types**\n\nThe organization of elements by types was first proposed by John Newlands in 1863.\n\n### **Development of types**\n\nThe development of types was further refined by Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869.\n\n### **Suggested distinguishing criteria**\n\nSuggestions for distinguishing criteria were made by various chemists, including Henry Moseley and Niels Bohr.\n\n**Comparison of Selected Properties**\n\n### **Physical properties by element type**\n\nThe following table compares the physical properties of nonmetals by element type:\n\n| Element Type | Melting Point (°C) | Boiling Point (°C) | Density (g/cm³) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Noble Gases | -252.4 (He) to 8.3 (Xe) | -252.4 (He) to 9.4 (Xe) | 0.178 (He) to 10.36 (Xe) |\n| Halogen Nonmetals | -220.7 (F) to 59.2 (I) | -188.1 (F) to 119.2 (I) | 1.18 (F) to 4.93 (I) |\n| Unclassified Nonmetals | 3500 (C) to 71.6 (S) | 3825 (C) to 444.6 (S) | 3.51 (C) to 2.69 (S) |\n\n### **Chemical properties by element type**\n\nThe following table compares the chemical properties of nonmetals by element type:\n\n| Element Type | Reactivity | Acid-Base Properties | Oxidation States |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Noble Gases | Unreactive | Neutral | 0 |\n| Halogen Nonmetals | Highly reactive | Acidic | -1 to +1 |\n| Unclassified Nonmetals | Variable | Variable | Variable |\n\n**See also**\n\n* Alkaline earth metals\n* Lanthanides\n* Actinides\n* Transition metals\n* Post-transition metals\n* Metalloids\n* Noble gases\n* Halogen nonmetals\n* Unclassified nonmetals\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The classification of nonmetals is not universally agreed upon and may vary depending on the source.\n* The properties of nonmetals can vary depending on the element and its allotrope.\n\n**References**\n\n* **Citations**\n\t+ Newlands, J.

The storm was caused by a low-pressure system that developed over the North Atlantic Ocean, leading to strong winds, heavy rain, and significant disruptions to transportation and daily life.\n\n# Meteorology\n------------\n\nStorm Eunice was a nor'easter, a type of winter storm that forms along the East Coast of North America and affects the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. However, in this case, the storm system developed over the North Atlantic Ocean and moved towards Europe, bringing strong winds and heavy rain to several countries.\n\nThe storm was classified as an \"atmospheric river\" event, a phenomenon where a long, narrow channel of moisture-laden air moves from the tropics to the mid-latitudes, often bringing heavy rain and strong winds. The storm system was fueled by the warm waters of the Gulf Stream, which helped to intensify the low-pressure system and bring it ashore.\n\n## Wind Patterns\nThe storm was characterized by strong winds, with gusts reaching speeds of over 100 km/h (62 mph) in some areas. The winds were strongest in the western parts of the affected countries, where they caused significant damage and disruption.\n\n## Pressure Drop\nThe storm was also associated with a significant drop in atmospheric pressure, with the lowest pressure recorded at 958 mbar (28.3 inHg) near the British Isles. This pressure drop contributed to the strong winds and rough seas that affected the area.\n\n# Impact\n-----\n\nStorm Eunice had a significant impact on several European countries, causing widespread disruptions to transportation, daily life, and the economy.\n\n## Belgium\nIn Belgium, the storm caused widespread power outages, with over 100,000 households left without electricity. The winds also caused significant damage to buildings and infrastructure, with several roads and bridges closed due to damage.\n\n## Czech Republic\nIn the Czech Republic, the storm caused significant disruptions to transportation, with several major highways closed due to strong winds and heavy rain. The winds also caused power outages, with over 10,000 households left without electricity.\n\n## Denmark\nIn Denmark, the storm caused widespread disruptions to transportation, with several major highways closed due to strong winds and heavy rain. The winds also caused significant damage to buildings and infrastructure, with several roofs blown off and windows shattered.\n\n## France\nIn France, the storm caused significant disruptions to transportation, with several major highways closed due to strong winds and heavy rain. The winds also caused power outages, with over 100,000 households left without electricity.\n\n## Germany\nIn Germany, the storm caused significant disruptions to transportation, with several major highways closed due to strong winds and heavy rain. The winds also caused power outages, with over 20,000 households left without electricity.\n\n## Ireland\nIn Ireland, the storm caused widespread disruptions to transportation, with several major highways closed due to strong winds and heavy rain.

The winds also caused power outages, with over 5,000 households left without electricity.\n\n## Luxembourg\nIn Luxembourg, the storm caused significant disruptions to transportation, with several major highways closed due to strong winds and heavy rain. The winds also caused power outages, with over 2,000 households left without electricity.\n\n## Netherlands\nIn the Netherlands, the storm caused widespread disruptions to transportation, with several major highways closed due to strong winds and heavy rain. The winds also caused significant damage to buildings and infrastructure, with several roofs blown off and windows shattered.\n\n## Poland\nIn Poland, the storm caused significant disruptions to transportation, with several major highways closed due to strong winds and heavy rain.

The path is a popular destination for cyclists, walkers, and joggers, and is a significant transportation route for the surrounding communities.\n\n**Route**\n\nThe Ballona Creek Bike Path is a linear route that follows the Ballona Creek from its mouth at the Santa Monica Bay to the city of Culver City. The path begins at the intersection of Venice Boulevard and Ballona Creek, where it passes under the Interstate 10 freeway. From there, it winds its way north along the creek, passing through the cities of Culver City, El Segundo, and Los Angeles.\n\nThe path is generally flat and smooth, making it suitable for a wide range of users, including families with young children, seniors, and people with disabilities. The path is also relatively quiet, with minimal traffic and noise pollution.\n\n**Airport**\n\nOne notable feature of the Ballona Creek Bike Path is its proximity to the Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). In fact, the path passes under the airport's perimeter fence, providing a unique view of the airport's runways and aircraft. However, due to security concerns, the path is closed to the public during airport operations, and users are not permitted to enter the airport grounds.\n\nDespite this restriction, the path remains a popular destination for airport enthusiasts and aviation enthusiasts. On clear days, users can see aircraft taking off and landing at LAX, as well as the airport's control towers and other infrastructure.\n\n**Conditions**\n\nThe Ballona Creek Bike Path is generally well-maintained and safe to use. However, users should be aware of certain conditions that may affect their experience.\n\n#### Rest stops\n\nThere are several rest stops and benches along the path, where users can take a break and rest their feet. These rest stops are typically spaced about a mile apart, and are equipped with picnic tables, benches, and trash receptacles.\n\n#### Homeless camping\n\nUnfortunately, the Ballona Creek Bike Path is also home to a number of homeless encampments. While these encampments are not directly within the path itself, they are often located nearby, and users may encounter individuals or groups of people who are living on the streets.\n\nIn response to this issue, the city has implemented various measures to address homelessness, including providing social services and support to those in need. However, the problem persists, and users should be aware of the potential for encountering homeless individuals or camps along the path.\n\n**Access gates**\n\nThere are several access gates along the Ballona Creek Bike Path, which provide users with entry and exit points to the path. These gates are typically located at major intersections or road crossings, and are equipped with signs and barriers to control access.\n\nUsers should note that some gates may be locked or closed for maintenance or security reasons, and should plan their route accordingly.\n\n**History**\n\nThe Ballona Creek Bike Path has a long and varied history, dating back to the early 20th century. In the 1920s, the creek was used as a site for oil drilling and extraction, but this activity was eventually phased out due to environmental concerns.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, the creek was used as a site for industrial and commercial activities, including the construction of a canal and the operation of a number of factories and warehouses. However, these activities also had negative environmental impacts, including pollution and habitat destruction.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, the creek was restored and revitalized through a series of environmental and recreational projects. These projects included the construction of the Ballona Creek Bike Path, as well as the creation of parks, trails, and other recreational facilities.\n\n**Improvements**\n\nThe Ballona Creek Bike Path has undergone several improvements over the years, including the installation of new lighting, signage, and other infrastructure. In recent years, the city has also implemented various safety measures, including the installation of security cameras and the deployment of additional law enforcement personnel.\n\nUsers should note that the path is subject to periodic maintenance and repairs, which may affect its availability or usability. However, the city typically provides advance notice of these activities, and users can plan their route accordingly.\n\n**Proposed extensions**\n\nThere are currently several proposed extensions to the Ballona Creek Bike Path, including a planned connection to the Marvin Braude Bike Trail (also known as \"The Strand\") in Santa Monica. This connection would provide users with a direct route from the Ballona Creek Bike Path to the beach and other coastal destinations.\n\nOther proposed extensions include a connection to the L.A. River Bike Path, which would provide users with a route from the Ballona Creek Bike Path to the city of Los Angeles and other destinations.\n\n**Gallery**\n\n* Ballona Creek Bike Path map\n* Ballona Creek Bike Path route\n* Ballona Creek Bike Path sign\n* Ballona Creek Bike Path rest stop\n* Ballona Creek Bike Path homeless encampment\n\n**See also**\n\n* Ballona Creek\n* Marvin Braude Bike Trail\n* L.A.

The shark is revealed to be an enormous and terrifying creature, with a length of over 60 feet and a powerful bite force capable of crushing steel.\n\nAs the team tries to escape the shark, they soon realize that it is not the only threat they face.

However, the song is not about his wife, but rather about a person he had a romantic relationship with in the past. Shelton has stated in interviews that the song's title character, Caroline, is a name that he has always been drawn to, and he wanted to write a song that captured the essence of a woman with that name.\n\nShelton has said that he came up with the idea for the song while on tour with his band. He was thinking about a girl he had dated in the past, and he started humming the melody and working out the lyrics.

The song's melody is simple and haunting, with a memorable chorus that showcases Shelton's vocal range.

Shelton's vocals are raw and emotional, and his delivery is both heartfelt and convincing. The song's chorus, \"Oh Caroline, I'm still in love with you,\" is a beautiful expression of longing and devotion.\n\nReception\n----------\n\n\" Oh Caroline\" was released in August 2016, and it quickly became a fan favorite.

The series features images of Campbell's soup cans, which became an iconic representation of American consumer culture. This article explores the early career of Warhol, the premiere of the series, the relationship between the artwork and the Campbell's Soup Company, and the variations and interpretations of the series.\n\n**Early Career**\n\nWarhol's interest in consumer culture and mass production was evident in his early work as a commercial illustrator in the 1940s and 1950s. He worked for several magazines, including Vogue and Harper's Bazaar, creating illustrations for fashion and beauty advertisements. In the late 1950s, Warhol began to explore the realm of fine art, producing silkscreen prints and paintings of popular culture icons such as Marilyn Monroe and Elizabeth Taylor.\n\n**New York Art Scene**\n\nIn the early 1960s, Warhol became a key figure in the New York art scene, along with artists such as Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, and Roy Lichtenstein. This group of artists, known as the Pop Art movement, sought to challenge traditional notions of art and explore the role of consumer culture in society. Warhol's work, in particular, explored the banality and ubiquity of consumer products, which he saw as a reflection of American culture.\n\n**Pop Art**\n\nThe Pop Art movement was characterized by its use of popular culture icons, such as consumer products, celebrities, and advertising imagery. Warhol's Campbell's Soup Cans series was a quintessential example of this movement, as it celebrated the everyday and the mundane. The series was a testament to Warhol's fascination with the banality of consumer culture and the ways in which it shapes our perceptions of reality.\n\n**Premiere**\n\nThe Campbell's Soup Cans series premiered at the Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles in 1962. The exhibition featured 32 silkscreen prints of Campbell's soup cans, each with a different label. The prints were created using a combination of silkscreen printing and painting, and were exhibited alongside other works by Warhol, including his famous Marilyn Monroe series.\n\n**Subsequent Publicity**\n\nThe premiere of the Campbell's Soup Cans series generated significant publicity for Warhol and the Pop Art movement. The series was seen as a radical departure from traditional notions of art, and the use of consumer products as subject matter was considered shocking and provocative. The series was widely covered in the media, and it helped to establish Warhol as a leading figure in the New York art scene.\n\n**Campbell's Soup Company**\n\nThe Campbell's Soup Company was founded in 1869 by Joseph A. Campbell and Abraham Anderson. The company quickly became a leading manufacturer of canned soups, and its products were widely distributed across the United States. In the 1960s, the company was facing increased competition from other food manufacturers, and it was looking for new ways to market its products and reach a wider audience.\n\n**Can and Label History**\n\nThe Campbell's Soup Company had a long history of using different can designs and labels to promote its products. In the 1960s, the company was using a variety of can designs, including a distinctive red and white color scheme. The labels featured the company's logo and the name of the soup product, along with a brief description of the ingredients and nutritional information.\n\n**Relation to Warhol's Art**\n\nWarhol's use of Campbell's soup cans as subject matter was seen as a commentary on the ubiquity and banality of consumer culture. The series was a reflection of Warhol's fascination with the ways in which consumer products shape our perceptions of reality. By using a product that was widely recognized and consumed, Warhol was able to comment on the ways in which consumer culture influences our lives.\n\n**Inspiration**\n\nWarhol's inspiration for the Campbell's Soup Cans series came from a variety of sources, including his own experiences as a consumer of the product. He was also influenced by the work of other artists, including Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg, who were exploring the use of consumer products as subject matter in their work.\n\n**Artist Colleagues**\n\nWarhol's work on the Campbell's Soup Cans series was influenced by his relationships with other artists, including Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg. These artists were part of the same art movement, and they were exploring similar themes and ideas in their work.\n\n**Interpretation**\n\nThe interpretation of the Campbell's Soup Cans series is complex and multifaceted. Some see the series as a commentary on the banality and ubiquity of consumer culture, while others see it as a celebration of the everyday and the mundane. Warhol's use of a widely recognized and consumed product as subject matter was seen as a radical departure from traditional notions of art, and the series was widely covered in the media.\n\n**Variations**\n\nThere are several variations of the Campbell's Soup Cans series, including:\n\n* **Campbell's Soup I and Campbell's Soup Cans II**: These two series feature silkscreen prints of Campbell's soup cans, each with a different label.\n* **Colored soup cans**: This series features silkscreen prints of Campbell's soup cans with colored labels.\n* **Unauthorized versions**: There are several unauthorized versions of the Campbell's Soup Cans series, created by other artists.\n* **Other variations**: There are several other variations of the series, including silkscreen prints of other consumer products.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Campbell's Soup Cans series is a seminal work of American art, created by Andy Warhol in 1962. The series features silkscreen prints of Campbell's soup cans, which became an iconic representation of American consumer culture. The series was a radical departure from traditional notions of art, and it helped to establish Warhol as a leading figure in the New York art scene.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Pop Art\n* Andy Warhol\n* Jasper Johns\n* Robert Rauschenberg\n* Campbell's Soup Company\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is based on a variety of sources, including biographies and art histories of Andy Warhol and the Campbell's Soup Company.\n* The Campbell's Soup Cans series is a complex and multifaceted work of art, and its interpretation is subject to multiple perspectives and interpretations.\n\n**References**\n\n* This article does not include citations or references, as the information is based on a variety of sources and is intended to be a general overview of the Campbell's Soup Cans series.\n\n**External links**\n\n* The Campbell's Soup Cans series is widely available in museums and art galleries around the world, including the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Tate Modern in London.\n* The Campbell's Soup Company is still in operation today, and its products are widely distributed across the United States.\n* Andy Warhol's work and legacy can be explored through the Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The mission marked a significant milestone in the development of the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and the Orion spacecraft. Launched on November 16, 2022, Artemis I aimed to test the SLS and Orion in a mission profile that simulated a trip to the Moon and back.\n\n**Mission Profile**\n\nThe Artemis I mission profile was designed to test the SLS and Orion in a lunar-bound trajectory. The mission plan involved launching the SLS rocket from Kennedy Space Center's Launch Complex 39B, followed by a trans-lunar injection (TLI) maneuver that would send the Orion spacecraft on a path towards the Moon.\n\n**Mission Profile Animation**\n\nAn animation of the Artemis I mission profile was created by NASA to illustrate the spacecraft's trajectory. The animation showed the SLS rocket lifting off from Kennedy Space Center, followed by the Orion spacecraft separating from the rocket and performing the TLI maneuver. The animation then depicted the Orion spacecraft entering lunar orbit and performing a series of flybys of the Moon before returning to Earth.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Artemis I mission was the result of a long-term effort by NASA to return humans to the lunar surface. The Artemis program was initiated in 2019, with the goal of sending the first woman and the next man to the lunar surface by 2025. The program involved the development of the SLS rocket, the Orion spacecraft, and a lunar lander capable of carrying humans to the lunar surface.\n\n**Ground Testing**\n\nBefore the Artemis I mission, the SLS rocket and the Orion spacecraft underwent extensive ground testing to ensure their readiness for flight. The testing included a series of static fires of the SLS rocket, as well as a series of tests of the Orion spacecraft's systems, including its propulsion and communication systems.\n\n**Assembly**\n\nThe Artemis I spacecraft was assembled at Kennedy Space Center, with the Orion spacecraft being integrated with the SLS rocket. The assembly process involved the installation of the Orion spacecraft's crew module, the service module, and the lunar Gateway, which provided power and communication capabilities for the spacecraft.\n\n**Launch Preparations**\n\nBefore the launch of the Artemis I mission, NASA conducted a series of launch preparations to ensure the successful launch of the SLS rocket. The preparations included the loading of the rocket's fuel tanks, the installation of the Orion spacecraft, and a series of final checks of the rocket's systems.\n\n**Initial Launch Attempts**\n\nThe Artemis I mission was initially scheduled to launch on August 29, 2022. However, the launch was scrubbed due to a technical issue with the SLS rocket. The issue was resolved, and the launch was rescheduled for September 3, 2022. However, the launch was again scrubbed due to a technical issue with the rocket's ignition system. The launch was rescheduled for November 16, 2022, which ultimately proved to be the successful launch date.\n\n**Flight**\n\nThe Artemis I mission began with the launch of the SLS rocket on November 16, 2022. The rocket lifted off from Kennedy Space Center's Launch Complex 39B and propelled the Orion spacecraft into space. The Orion spacecraft performed the TLI maneuver, sending it on a path towards the Moon.\n\n**Launch**\n\nThe launch of the Artemis I mission was a complex process that involved the separation of the SLS rocket from the launch pad and the ignition of the rocket's main engines. The rocket lifted off from the launch pad at 1:47 a.m. EST on November 16, 2022, and reached a maximum altitude of 86.9 miles (140 kilometers) before separating from the Orion spacecraft.\n\n**Outbound Flight**\n\nThe Orion spacecraft performed the TLI maneuver, sending it on a path towards the Moon. The spacecraft traveled for approximately 25 days, during which time it performed a series of course corrections to ensure it remained on track.\n\n**Lunar Orbit**\n\nThe Orion spacecraft entered lunar orbit on December 11, 2022, where it performed a series of flybys of the Moon. The spacecraft flew within 2,400 miles (3,862 kilometers) of the lunar surface before returning to a stable orbit.\n\n**Return Flight**\n\nThe Orion spacecraft began its return flight to Earth on December 19, 2022, when it performed a series of course corrections to ensure it remained on track. The spacecraft traveled for approximately 10 days, during which time it performed a series of course corrections and system checks.\n\n**Reentry and Splashdown**\n\nThe Orion spacecraft reentered Earth's atmosphere on December 26, 2022, and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean. The splashdown marked the end of the Artemis I mission, which had been successful in testing the SLS rocket and the Orion spacecraft in a lunar-bound trajectory.\n\n**Payloads**\n\nThe Artemis I mission carried a number of payloads, including a series of cubesats that were designed to test the spacecraft's systems and provide scientific data. The cubesats were deployed from the Orion spacecraft during the mission and were designed to test the spacecraft's ability to deploy and communicate with small satellites.\n\n**Cubesats**\n\nThe cubesats carried on the Artemis I mission were designed to test the spacecraft's systems and provide scientific data. The cubesats were deployed from the Orion spacecraft during the mission and were designed to test the spacecraft's ability to deploy and communicate with small satellites. The cubesats were equipped with a variety of instruments, including cameras, radio transceivers, and sensors.\n\n**Media Outreach**\n\nThe Artemis I mission was the subject of extensive media coverage, with NASA providing regular updates on the mission's progress. The media outreach effort included press conferences, social media updates, and live coverage of the mission.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Artemis program\n* Space Launch System\n* Orion spacecraft\n* Lunar Gateway\n\n**Notes**\n\nThe Artemis I mission was a significant milestone in the development of the Space Launch System and the Orion spacecraft.

Atomic clocks are the most accurate timekeeping devices in the world, and they are used as the primary time standard for modern society.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nAtomic clocks are a significant improvement over mechanical clocks, which were the primary timekeeping devices for centuries. The first mechanical clock was invented in the 13th century, and it was a major innovation in timekeeping. However, mechanical clocks were not very accurate, and they required constant adjustments to keep them ticking correctly. The invention of atomic clocks revolutionized timekeeping, and they have been used as the primary time standard for over 60 years.\n\n**History**\n\n### Definition of the Second\n\nThe definition of the second is the fundamental unit of time in the International System of Units (SI). It is defined as the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium-133 atom. This definition was adopted in 1967 and has been the basis for modern timekeeping ever since.\n\n### Metrology Advancements and Optical Clocks\n\nIn the 1990s, metrologists made significant advancements in the field of atomic clocks. The development of optical clocks, which use laser light to measure the frequency of atoms, greatly improved the accuracy of atomic clocks. Optical clocks have the potential to be even more accurate than the current generation of atomic clocks, and they are being developed for use as future time standards.\n\n### Chip-Scale Atomic Clocks\n\nChip-scale atomic clocks are small, portable atomic clocks that are designed to be used in a variety of applications. They are typically made using microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology and are capable of achieving high accuracy and stability. Chip-scale atomic clocks have the potential to revolutionize the field of timekeeping and are being used in a variety of applications, including navigation and timing systems.\n\n**Measuring Time with Atomic Clocks**\n\n### Clock Mechanism\n\nAn atomic clock uses a clock mechanism to measure the frequency of atoms. The clock mechanism consists of a resonator, which is a device that is used to measure the frequency of the atoms, and a counter, which is used to count the number of cycles of the resonator. The resonator is typically a quartz crystal or a metal cavity, and the counter is typically an electronic circuit.\n\n### Tuning and Optimization\n\nTo achieve high accuracy and stability, atomic clocks require tuning and optimization. This involves adjusting the frequency of the clock to match the frequency of the atoms, and then fine-tuning the clock to achieve the highest possible accuracy. Tuning and optimization are critical steps in the operation of an atomic clock, and they are typically performed on a regular basis.\n\n**Accuracy**\n\nAtomic clocks are the most accurate timekeeping devices in the world. They are capable of achieving an accuracy of one second in tens of millions of years. The accuracy of an atomic clock is determined by the frequency of the atoms used in the clock, as well as the stability of the clock mechanism. The most accurate atomic clocks use caesium-133 atoms, which have a frequency of 9,192,631,770 Hz.\n\n**Comparing Atomic Clocks**\n\n### Time Standards\n\nAtomic clocks are used as the primary time standard for modern society.
