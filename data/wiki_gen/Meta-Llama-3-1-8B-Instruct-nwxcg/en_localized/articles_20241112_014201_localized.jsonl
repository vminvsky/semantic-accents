The tropical cyclone season was marked by an above-average number of storms, with a total of 25 named storms and 13 typhoons.\n\n**Seasonal Forecasts**\n\nPrior to the start of the season, several organizations issued forecasts for the number of tropical cyclones that would occur during the season. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) predicted an above-average number of storms, with 25-30 named tropical cyclones. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) also predicted an above-average season, with 25-30 named storms. These forecasts proved to be accurate, with 25 named storms and 13 typhoons occurring during the season.\n\n**Seasonal Summary**\n\nThe 2022 Pacific typhoon season was characterized by a mix of early, peak, and late season activity.\n\n### Early Season Activity\n\nThe first tropical cyclone of the season, Tropical Depression 01W, formed on January 16. This was followed by Typhoon Malakas (Basyang), which formed on January 25 and became the first typhoon of the season. The early season was marked by a strong subtropical ridge, which suppressed the formation of tropical cyclones. However, once the ridge weakened, the atmosphere became more conducive for tropical cyclone development, leading to an increase in activity.\n\n### Peak Season Activity\n\nThe peak season, which typically occurs between July and September, saw the most intense activity of the season. Several intense typhoons formed during this period, including Typhoon Chaba (Caloy), Tropical Storm Megi (Agaton), and Typhoon Hinnamnor (Henry). These storms brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to several countries in the region, causing significant damage and disruption.\n\n### Late Season Activity\n\nThe late season, which occurred from October to November, saw a decrease in activity. However, several tropical cyclones still formed during this period, including Typhoon Merbok and Typhoon Nanmadol (Josie). These storms brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to several countries in the region, causing significant damage and disruption.\n\n**Systems**\n\nThe 2022 Pacific typhoon season saw the formation of 25 named storms and 13 typhoons.

This genre involves creating a set of pieces that cover all 24 keys, either in the major or minor mode, or a combination of both. This article will delve into the notable sets that cover all 24 keys, composers who wrote multiple sets, variants, and the history of this genre.\n\nNotable Sets That Cover All 24 Keys\n\nSeveral notable sets have been written to cover all 24 keys. One of the most famous sets is Johann Sebastian Bach's \"Das Musikalische Opfer\" (The Musical Offering), which consists of 14 canons and fugues that cover all 24 keys. Another notable set is George Frideric Handel's \"Messiah,\" which contains several movements that modulate through all 24 keys.\n\nComposers Who Wrote Multiple Sets\n\nSeveral composers have written multiple sets of music that cover all 24 keys. One such composer is Johann Sebastian Bach, who wrote several sets of canons and fugues, including \"Das Musikalische Opfer\" and \"The Art of Fugue.\" Another composer is Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, who wrote several sets of variations that cover all 24 keys.\n\nVariants\n\nThere are several variants of music written in all major or minor keys. One variant is single pieces that modulate through many keys. An example of such a piece is Ludwig van Beethoven's \"Fur Elise,\" which modulates through several keys before returning to the original key.\n\nSingle Pieces that Modulate Through Many Keys\n\nSingle pieces that modulate through many keys are a common variant of music written in all major or minor keys. These pieces often involve complex harmonies and modulations that move through several keys before returning to the original key. An example of such a piece is Franz Liszt's \"La Campanella,\" which modulates through several keys before returning to the original key.\n\nWorks Covering All Eight Church Modes\n\nAnother variant of music written in all major or minor keys is works that cover all eight church modes. The church modes are a set of seven modes that were used in ancient Greek and Roman music. One example of a work that covers all eight church modes is the \"Dies Irae,\" a medieval Latin hymn that has been arranged in various keys.\n\nOther Sets of 24 Pieces\n\nThere are several other sets of 24 pieces that have been written to cover all 24 keys. One example is the \"24 Preludes and Fugues\" by Johann Sebastian Bach, which consists of 24 preludes and fugues that cover all 24 keys. Another example is the \"24 Etudes\" by Frédéric Chopin, which consists of 24 etudes that cover all 24 keys.\n\nKeys\n\nThe order of keys in published works can vary depending on the composer and the style of music. In the Baroque period, the order of keys was often based on the tonal system, with the major keys following the minor keys. In the Classical period, the order of keys was often based on the harmonic system, with the keys following a specific pattern of major and minor keys.\n\nOrder of Keys in Published Works\n\nIn some published works, the order of keys was based on a specific pattern. For example, in Johann Sebastian Bach's \"Das Musikalische Opfer,\" the order of keys is based on a specific pattern of major and minor keys. In other works, the order of keys is based on a random sequence.\n\nHistory\n\nMusic written in all major or minor keys has a long history that spans several centuries. The earliest known examples of this genre date back to the medieval period, when musicians used the church modes to create music that covered all 24 keys.\n\nBach and His Precursors\n\nOne of the earliest known examples of music written in all major or minor keys is the \"Dies Irae,\" a medieval Latin hymn that has been arranged in various keys. Another early example is the \"Missa Prolationum\" by Guillaume de Machaut, a French composer who lived in the 14th century.\n\nAfter Bach\n\nAfter Johann Sebastian Bach, music written in all major or minor keys continued to evolve. In the Classical period, composers such as Haydn and Mozart wrote music that covered all 24 keys. In the Romantic period, composers such as Chopin and Liszt wrote music that was even more complex and expressive.\n\n18th and 19th Centuries\n\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, music written in all major or minor keys continued to evolve. Composers such as Haydn and Mozart wrote music that covered all 24 keys, while composers such as Chopin and Liszt wrote music that was even more complex and expressive.\n\n1850–1900\n\nDuring this period, composers such as Brahms and Strauss wrote music that covered all 24 keys. Brahms's \"Paganini Variations\" is a famous example of music written in all major or minor keys.\n\n1901–1950\n\nIn the 20th century, music written in all major or minor keys continued to evolve. Composers such as Stravinsky and Bartok wrote music that was even more complex and expressive.\n\n1951–2000\n\nDuring this period, composers such as Stockhausen and Boulez wrote music that covered all 24 keys. Stockhausen's \"Telemusik\" is a famous example of music written in all major or minor keys.\n\n21st Century\n\nIn the 21st century, music written in all major or minor keys continues to evolve. Composers such as Ligeti and Adams have written music that covers all 24 keys, while composers such as Reich and Glass have written music that is even more complex and expressive.\n\nNotes\n\nMusic written in all major or minor keys is a unique and fascinating genre that has been explored by numerous composers throughout history. This genre involves creating a set of pieces that cover all 24 keys, either in the major or minor mode, or a combination of both.

He is a multiple-time world champion and Olympic medalist, and has been involved in various high-profile conflicts with his national skating union and coaches throughout his career.\n\n**Early life and education**\n\nViktor_An was born on January 22, 1983, in Seoul, South Korea. His parents were both figure skating enthusiasts, and he began skating at the age of three. An's early training was overseen by his mother, a former competitive skater, who recognized his natural talent and dedication to the sport.\n\nAn attended the Korea National Sports University (KNSU), where he studied sports science and began competing at the national and international levels. During his time at KNSU, An won multiple national championships and was selected to represent South Korea at the 2002 Winter Olympics.\n\n**Career**\n\n### **2000s**\n\n#### **Early career and the 2002 Winter Olympics**\n\nAn's early career was marked by rapid success. At the age of 19, he won his first national championship and was selected to represent South Korea at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. An's performance at the Olympics was highlighted by a clean short program and a stunning long program, which earned him a silver medal in the pairs event.\n\n#### **National team 'recommendation system'**\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2002 Olympics, An became embroiled in a controversy surrounding the South Korean national team's recommendation system. The system, which was designed to select the country's top skaters for international competitions, was criticized for being biased towards established athletes and favoring those with connections to the national skating union.\n\nAn, who was then just 20 years old, was caught in the middle of the controversy. He was accused of being favored by the system and was subsequently stripped of his national championship title. An denied any wrongdoing and maintained that he was a victim of the system's flaws.\n\n#### **2002-2005, KNSU and Non-KNSU**\n\nAn's time at KNSU was marked by both success and controversy. He continued to compete at the national and international levels, winning multiple championships and earning a reputation as one of South Korea's top skaters. However, he also became increasingly critical of the national skating union and its handling of the recommendation system.\n\nIn 2005, An made headlines when he publicly accused the Korea Skating Union (KSU) of favoritism and corruption. He claimed that the union was biased towards established athletes and that he had been unfairly targeted by the system.\n\n### **2005, Conflict with Korea Skating Union**\n\nThe conflict between An and the KSU came to a head in 2005.

Many athletes and coaches came out in support of An, criticizing the KSU for its handling of the situation.\n\n### **2006 Winter Olympics**\n\nDespite his conflict with the KSU, An was selected to represent South Korea at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Torino. He performed well in the pairs event, finishing sixth overall.\n\n### **After Torino**\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2006 Olympics, An announced that he would be leaving the national team.

He began to focus on coaching and sports administration, working with young athletes and helping to develop the South Korean figure skating program.\n\n### **Injury in early 2008**\n\nIn early 2008, An suffered a serious injury that forced him to take a break from competition. He underwent surgery and spent several months recovering from his injury.\n\n### **2010s**\n\n#### **2010, Conflict with Korea Skating Union**\n\nThe conflict between An and the KSU continued into the 2010s. In 2010, An was accused of violating the national team's code of conduct and was subsequently banned from competing for the next two years.\n\nAn denied any wrongdoing and maintained that he was a victim of the system's flaws. He continued to work as a coach and sports administrator, helping to develop the South Korean figure skating program.\n\n#### **Naturalization to Russia**\n\nIn 2013, An announced that he had been naturalized as a Russian citizen. He cited his love of Russian culture and his desire to contribute to the country's figure skating program as the reasons for his decision.\n\n#### **2011, Conflict with the South Korean coaches**\n\nAn's conflict with the South Korean coaches continued into the 2010s. In 2011, he was accused of being a \"traitor\" by the country's figure skating community for his decision to naturalize as a Russian citizen.\n\nAn maintained that he was a victim of the system's flaws and that he was simply trying to pursue his own career path. He continued to work as a coach and sports administrator, helping to develop the Russian figure skating program.\n\n#### **Heading to Sochi**\n\nIn 2013, An announced that he would be heading to Sochi to work as a coach and sports administrator for the Russian figure skating team. He cited his desire to contribute to the country's figure skating program and to help the team win medals at the 2014 Winter Olympics.\n\n#### **2014 Winter Olympics**\n\nAn played a key role in the Russian figure skating team's success at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi.

It was the first state election to be held in Johor since the 2018 general election.\n\n**Election cycles**\n\nThe Johor State Legislative Assembly is a unicameral legislative body that represents the state of Johor in Malaysia. The assembly is composed of 56 members, each representing a different constituency in the state. Members of the assembly are elected by the people of Johor through a first-past-the-post system. The election cycle for the Johor state assembly is typically held every five years, with the most recent election being held in 2018.\n\n**Electoral system**\n\nThe election is conducted under the First-Past-The-Post (FPTP) system, where the candidate with the most votes in a constituency is elected as the representative of that constituency. The electoral system used in the Johor state election is similar to the system used in federal elections in Malaysia.\n\n**Constituencies**\n\nThe 56 constituencies in Johor are divided into several different groups, including urban, rural, and special constituencies. The urban constituencies are located in the urban areas of Johor Bahru, the capital city of Johor, while the rural constituencies are located in the rural areas of the state. The special constituencies are reserved for the indigenous people of Johor, including the Orang Asli.\n\n**Composition before dissolution**\n\nThe Johor State Legislative Assembly was dissolved on January 22, 2022, after the expiration of its term. At the time of dissolution, the assembly was composed of 56 members, with the Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition holding 28 seats, the Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition holding 22 seats, and the independent members holding 6 seats.\n\n**Timeline**\n\n### Events from the Dissolution of the Johor State Legislative Assembly to the Issue of the Writ of Election (22 January to 9 February 2022)\n\nThe Johor State Legislative Assembly was dissolved on January 22, 2022, after the expiration of its term. The Election Commission of Malaysia (EC) then announced that the writ of election would be issued on February 9, 2022.\n\nOn February 9, 2022, the EC issued the writ of election, announcing that the Johor state election would be held on March 12, 2022.\n\n### Events from the Issue of the Writ of Election to the Nomination Day (10 to 26 February 2022)\n\nAfter the writ of election was issued, the EC announced that nomination day for the Johor state election would be held on February 26, 2022. Candidates had to submit their nomination papers to the EC on or before the nomination day.\n\nOn February 26, 2022, the EC announced that 198 candidates had submitted their nomination papers, including 71 independents, 68 BN candidates, and 59 PH candidates.\n\n### Events from the Nomination Day to the Early Polling Day for Postal and Advance Voters & Campaigning Period (27 February to 12 March 2022)\n\nAfter the nomination day, the campaigning period for the Johor state election began. Candidates were able to campaign for votes until the polling day on March 12, 2022.\n\nOn March 5, 2022, the EC announced that early polling would be held for postal and advance voters on March 9, 2022. This was done to ensure that the votes of these voters were counted and included in the final results.\n\n**Electoral candidates**\n\nA total of 198 candidates contested in the Johor state election, including 71 independents, 68 BN candidates, and 59 PH candidates. The candidates included several notable politicians, including former Johor Menteri Besar Osman Sapian and former PH Johor chairman Shahrir Samad.\n\n**Results**\n\n### By parliamentary constituency\n\nThe results of the Johor state election were announced on March 12, 2022. The BN coalition won 40 seats, while the PH coalition won 15 seats, and the independent candidates won 1 seat.\n\n### Seats that changed allegiance\n\nA total of 10 seats changed allegiance from the previous assembly, including 5 seats that changed from PH to BN, 3 seats that changed from independent to BN, and 2 seats that changed from PH to independent.\n\n**Election pendulum**\n\nThe election pendulum is a graphical representation of the voting intentions in each constituency. The pendulum is based on the two-party preferred vote and is used to predict the outcome of the election.\n\nIn the 2022 Johor state election, the pendulum showed that the BN coalition had a strong lead in several constituencies, including the urban constituencies of Johor Bahru.\n\n**Departing incumbents**\n\nA total of 28 members of the Johor State Legislative Assembly who were elected in 2018 were not re-elected in 2022, including 15 PH members, 12 BN members, and 1 independent member.\n\n**Controversies and issues**\n\nThe 2022 Johor state election was marred by several controversies and issues, including allegations of vote buying and election fraud.\n\nOn March 10, 2022, the EC announced that it had received complaints of vote buying in several constituencies, including the constituency of Johor Bahru Utara.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe 2022 Johor state election marked a significant shift in the balance of power in the Johor State Legislative Assembly, with the BN coalition regaining control of the assembly.\n\nThe election also marked a significant blow to the PH coalition, which lost several seats and saw its share of the vote decline.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Johor State Legislative Assembly\n* Election Commission of Malaysia\n* Barisan Nasional\n* Pakatan Harapan\n* Johor Bahru\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The 2022 Johor state election was the first state election to be held in Johor since the 2018 general election.\n* The election was held on March 12, 2022.\n* A total of 198 candidates contested in the election.\n* The BN coalition won 40 seats, while the PH coalition won 15 seats, and the independent candidates won 1 seat.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The protests have also seen a significant level of international attention, with many countries condemning the Iranian government's actions and calling for greater freedoms and human rights for women in Iran.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Condition of women and the Islamic Republic\n\nWomen in Iran face significant restrictions on their rights and freedoms under the Islamic Republic, which has been in power since 1979. The country has a strict dress code, known as the hijab, which requires women to cover their hair and neck in public. Women who fail to comply with the dress code can be arrested and even jailed. The country also has significant restrictions on women's access to education, employment, and healthcare.\n\n### Protest movements under the Islamic Republic\n\nSince the establishment of the Islamic Republic, there have been several significant protest movements, including the 1978-79 Iranian Revolution, which led to the overthrow of the Shah and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, and the 2009 Green Movement, which was a series of protests against the disputed presidential election results. However, the Mahsa Amini protests have been different in scale and scope, with widespread protests across the country and a significant level of international attention.\n\n### Mahsa Amini's arrest and death in custody\n\nMahsa Amini was a 22-year-old Iranian Kurdish woman from Saqqez, a city in Kurdistan Province. She was arrested by the morality police in Tehran on September 13, 2022, for allegedly violating the country's strict dress code. According to reports, she was taken to a police station and later transferred to a hospital, where she died three days later. The cause of her death was initially unclear, but later reports suggested that she had suffered a heart attack and had been subjected to physical abuse while in custody.\n\n**Protests**\n\n### Slogans and grievances\n\nThe protests, which began in Tehran and later spread to other cities across the country, have been marked by a variety of slogans and grievances. Protesters have been demanding greater freedoms and human rights for women in Iran, as well as an end to the country's strict dress code and the morality police. They have also been calling for the release of women who have been arrested and jailed for violating the dress code.\n\n### Iranian public opinion\n\nPublic opinion in Iran has been divided on the protests, with some people supporting the demonstrators and others condemning them. The Iranian government has been using state-controlled media to try to downplay the protests and portray them as a foreign-backed plot. However, many Iranians have been taking to social media to express their support for the protesters and their demands for greater freedoms.\n\n### Protest techniques\n\nThe protests have been marked by a variety of techniques, including marches, demonstrations, and sit-ins. Protesters have also been using social media to organize and coordinate their activities, as well as to spread their message and reach a wider audience.\n\n### Civil boycotts\n\nSome Iranians have been calling for a civil boycott of the government and its institutions, including schools and universities. The boycotts have been seen as a way to express opposition to the government's policies and to put pressure on the authorities to reform.\n\n### Media Western coverage\n\nThe protests have received significant coverage in Western media, with many outlets reporting on the demonstrations and the government's response. The coverage has been seen as a way to raise awareness about the situation in Iran and to put pressure on the authorities to reform.\n\n**Casualties, government response**\n\n### Casualties\n\nThe protests have been marked by a significant number of casualties, including injuries and deaths on both sides. According to reports, over 500 people have been killed and thousands more injured in the violence.\n\n### Government casualties\n\nThe government has reported that several of its security personnel have been killed in the violence, including police officers and soldiers.\n\n### Arrests and death sentences\n\nThe government has arrested thousands of people in connection with the protests, including many women who have been accused of violating the dress code. Some of those arrested have been sentenced to death, sparking international condemnation.\n\n### Executions\n\nSeveral people have been executed in connection with the protests, including a 23-year-old man who was hanged in Tehran in October 2022. The executions have been widely condemned by human rights groups and governments around the world.\n\n### Suspected food poisoning\n\nSome reports have suggested that food poisoning may have been a factor in the deaths of some protesters, particularly in the early stages of the demonstrations. However, the exact circumstances of the deaths remain unclear.\n\n### University students\n\nUniversity students have been at the forefront of the protests, with many campuses being the site of clashes between protesters and security forces. The students have been demanding greater freedoms and an end to the country's strict dress code.\n\n### Schoolgirls\n\nSchoolgirls have also been involved in the protests, with many taking to social media to express their support for the demonstrations and their demands for greater freedoms.\n\n**Statements by officials**\n\nThe Iranian government has released several statements in response to the protests, including a statement from the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has accused the protesters of being \"thugs\" and \"foreign-backed traitors.\"\n\n**Government strategy and tactics**\n\nThe government has used a variety of strategies and tactics to try to quell the protests, including the use of force, arrests, and propaganda. The authorities have also been trying to divide the protesters and turn them against each other.\n\n**Communications blackouts**\n\nThe government has imposed communications blackouts in some areas to try to prevent protesters from organizing and coordinating their activities.\n\n**Response by regime supporters**\n\nSome regime supporters have been taking to social media to express their support for the government and its actions. However, many others have been criticizing the government's response to the protests and calling for greater freedoms.\n\n**Government campaign for public opinion**\n\nThe government has launched a campaign to try to win over public opinion, including the use of propaganda and social media. However, many Iranians have been skeptical of the government's claims and have continued to demand greater freedoms.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\n### Lack of head covering\n\nThe protests have led to a significant increase in women going without their head coverings in public, particularly in Tehran and other major cities. The move has been seen as a way for women to express their defiance against the government's strict dress code.\n\n### Crackdown\n\nThe government has launched a crackdown on women who have been seen without their head coverings in public, including arrests and fines. The crackdown has been widely condemned by human rights groups and governments around the world.\n\n### Surveillance of protesters and dissidents\n\nThe government has been increasing its surveillance of protesters and dissidents, including the use of social media monitoring and online tracking. The move has been seen as a way to try to prevent future protests and maintain control over the population.\n\n**Analysis**\n\nThe Mahsa Amini protests have been a significant challenge to the Iranian government's authority, with widespread demonstrations and demands for greater freedoms and human rights. The protests have also highlighted the country's strict dress code and the morality police, which have been widely criticized by human rights groups and governments around the world.\n\n**International reactions**\n\n### International organizations\n\nThe protests have been widely condemned by international organizations, including the United Nations and the European Union. The organizations have called for greater freedoms and human rights in Iran and have expressed concern about the country's treatment of women.\n\n### Diplomatic ties\n\nSome countries have suspended diplomatic ties with Iran in response to the protests, including the United States and several European countries. The move has been seen as a way to put pressure on the Iranian government to reform.\n\n### Human rights advocates\n\nHuman rights advocates have been widely critical of the Iranian government's response to the protests, including the use of force and the imposition of communications blackouts. The advocates have called for greater freedoms and human rights in Iran and have expressed concern about the country's treatment of women.\n\n### Sanctions\n\nSome countries have imposed sanctions on Iran in response to the protests, including the United States and several European countries. The move has been seen as a way to put pressure on the Iranian government to reform and to maintain pressure on the country to respect human rights and the rule of law.\n\n**In popular culture**\n\n### Music\n\nThe protests have been the subject of several songs, including \"Woman, Life, Freedom\" by Shahram Shabpareh, which has become an anthem for the movement. The song has been widely shared on social media and has been seen as a way to express solidarity with the protesters.\n\n### Sports\n\nThe protests have also been the subject of controversy in the sports world, particularly in the context of the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Some Iranian players have been seen as supporting the protests, while others have been criticized for their response to the situation.\n\n### Commercialism\n\nThe protests have also been the subject of commercialism, with some companies using the movement as a way to promote their products and services.

The term encompasses a broad range of styles, genres, and historical periods, from silent films to contemporary blockbusters.\n\nIntroduction\n\nWomen have been a vital part of the film industry since its inception, contributing to the development of cinematic storytelling, style, and themes. However, their contributions have often been overlooked or marginalized, leading to a lack of representation and recognition in the field. This article aims to highlight the significant contributions of women in cinema, from the silent era to the present day, and explore the impact of women's cinema on society.\n\nFamous Women in Film History\n\n### Silent Films\n\nDuring the silent era, women played a crucial role in the development of film as an art form. Pioneers such as Alice Guy-Blaché, Lois Weber, and Mabel Normand were among the first women to work behind the camera, gaining independence and creative control through their innovative filmmaking techniques.\n\n### Classical Hollywood\n\nIn the classical Hollywood era, women like Bette Davis, Barbara Stanwyck, and Joan Crawford became icons of the silver screen, breaking down barriers for women in film. They paved the way for future generations of women in cinema, demonstrating the power of female performers and the potential for women to succeed in the male-dominated film industry.\n\n### Experimental and Avant-Garde Cinema\n\nWomen have also made significant contributions to experimental and avant-garde cinema, pushing the boundaries of traditional storytelling and aesthetics. Filmmakers such as Maya Deren, Chantal Akerman, and Yvonne Rainer have experimented with non-traditional narrative structures, exploring themes of identity, politics, and social justice.\n\nImpact on Society\n\n### Impact of Second-Wave Feminism\n\nThe second-wave feminist movement of the 1960s and 1970s had a profound impact on women's cinema, as women filmmakers began to explore themes of feminism, identity, and social justice. Films like Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975) and The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie (1972) critiqued patriarchal norms and institutions, inspiring a new generation of feminist filmmakers.\n\n### Representing Sexuality\n\nWomen's cinema has also played a crucial role in representing female sexuality, challenging traditional representations of women as passive and asexual. Filmmakers like Luisa Della Noce and Erika Lust have created provocative and unapologetic representations of female desire, capturing the complexity and diversity of women's experiences.\n\n### Fear of Entering Cinematography\n\nDespite the contributions of women in cinema, many still face significant barriers to entering the industry. Women are underrepresented in key creative roles, such as directing and cinematography, and often face sexism and misogyny in the workplace. According to a 2020 report, women made up only 13% of writers, 15% of directors, and 17% of editors in the film industry.\n\n### Statistics\n\n* Women represent 51% of the total film industry workforce.\n* Women hold only 16% of key creative positions (director, writer, producer, editor).\n* Women earn 77 cents for every dollar earned by men in the film industry.\n\n### Documentaries\n\nWomen's cinema has also made significant contributions to documentary filmmaking, exploring themes of social justice, identity, and politics. Filmmakers like Laura Poitras and Julia Bacha have created powerful and thought-provoking documentaries, shedding light on critical issues and inspiring social change.\n\n### Female Filmmakers as Feminists\n\nMany women filmmakers have identified as feminists, using their work to challenge patriarchal norms and institutions. Filmmakers like Agnès Varda and Sally Potter have created feminist films that critique societal expectations and promote women's empowerment.\n\n### Celluloid Ceiling\n\nThe celluloid ceiling refers to the lack of representation and opportunities for women in film. Despite their significant contributions to the industry, women continue to face obstacles in achieving creative freedom and financial stability. According to a 2020 report, women are underrepresented in key creative roles and often earn less than their male counterparts.\n\nNorth America\n\n### Canada\n\nCanada has a rich tradition of women's cinema, with filmmakers like Sarah Polley and Deepa Mehta making significant contributions to the industry.

The bank's failure was the second-largest in U.S. history, with only Washington Mutual Bank being larger. The collapse had significant effects on the financial system, customers, and shareholders of the bank.\n\n**Background**\n\nSilicon Valley Bank was founded in 1983 in Santa Clara, California, with the goal of serving the financial needs of the technology industry. The bank quickly grew and became a major player in the financial industry, providing a range of services including lending, deposit accounts, and investment banking. SVB's client base included many of the most prominent technology companies in the world, including Google, Facebook, and Tesla.\n\nSVB's business model was based on providing loans to technology companies, particularly startups and venture-backed companies. The bank's strategy was to provide loans to companies with high growth potential, even if they did not have a proven track record of profitability. This strategy allowed SVB to grow rapidly and become one of the largest banks in the United States.\n\n**Collapse**\n\nThe collapse of Silicon Valley Bank began in late February 2023, when the bank's stock price began to decline rapidly. The decline was triggered by a combination of factors, including the failure of several prominent technology companies and a decline in the overall stock market. As the bank's stock price fell, depositors began to withdraw their funds from the bank, leading to a bank run.\n\n**Losses**\n\nThe collapse of Silicon Valley Bank resulted in significant losses for the bank's depositors, shareholders, and the FDIC. The FDIC estimated that the bank's failure would result in a loss of around $20 billion, making it the second-largest bank failure in U.S. history. The bank's depositors lost around $8 billion, while shareholders lost around $10 billion.\n\n**Instability**\n\nThe collapse of Silicon Valley Bank led to significant instability in the financial system. The bank's failure led to a decline in confidence among depositors and investors, causing a rapid decline in the stock market. The bank's failure also led to a decline in lending and economic activity, as banks became more cautious in their lending practices.\n\n**Receivership**\n\nOn March 10, 2023, the FDIC was appointed as the receiver of Silicon Valley Bank. The FDIC took control of the bank's assets and liabilities, and began the process of liquidating the bank's assets to pay off its debts. The FDIC also set up a new bank, Silicon Valley Bridge Bank, to take over the bank's deposits and provide continuity for the bank's customers.\n\n**Acquisition**\n\nOn March 13, 2023, the FDIC announced that First Citizens Bancshares had agreed to acquire Silicon Valley Bridge Bank, the new bank set up by the FDIC to take over the deposits of Silicon Valley Bank. The acquisition was completed on May 1, 2023, and marked the end of the Silicon Valley Bank era.\n\n**Effects**\n\nThe collapse of Silicon Valley Bank had significant effects on the financial system, customers, and shareholders of the bank.\n\n**Customers**\n\nThe collapse of Silicon Valley Bank had a significant impact on the bank's customers, particularly technology companies. The bank's failure led to a decline in confidence among depositors, causing a rapid decline in the bank's deposits. The bank's customers also lost access to their funds, as the bank's branches and online banking systems were shut down.\n\n**Shareholders**\n\nThe collapse of Silicon Valley Bank resulted in significant losses for the bank's shareholders. The bank's stock price declined rapidly, causing shareholders to lose a significant portion of their investment.\n\n**Financial system**\n\nThe collapse of Silicon Valley Bank had a significant impact on the financial system, leading to a decline in confidence among depositors and investors. The bank's failure led to a decline in lending and economic activity, as banks became more cautious in their lending practices.\n\n**Legal actions**\n\nThe collapse of Silicon Valley Bank led to a number of legal actions, including lawsuits against the bank's directors and officers. The FDIC also launched an investigation into the bank's failure, with the goal of determining the causes of the collapse.\n\n**Reactions**\n\nThe collapse of Silicon Valley Bank was met with a number of reactions, including official responses and debate over government intervention.\n\n**Official responses**\n\nThe collapse of Silicon Valley Bank was met with official responses from government agencies and regulatory bodies. The FDIC stated that it had taken steps to protect the bank's depositors and prevent a wider collapse of the financial system. The Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department also issued statements, outlining their plans to stabilize the financial system and prevent a repeat of the bank's collapse.\n\n**Debate over government intervention**\n\nThe collapse of Silicon Valley Bank led to a debate over government intervention in the financial system. Some argued that the government had done too little to prevent the bank's collapse, while others argued that the government had done too much. The debate highlighted the challenges of regulating the financial system and the need for a balanced approach to regulation.\n\n**Debate about causes**\n\nThe collapse of Silicon Valley Bank led to a debate about the causes of the bank's failure. Some argued that the bank's collapse was the result of a combination of factors, including the failure of several prominent technology companies and a decline in the overall stock market. Others argued that the bank's collapse was the result of poor management and a failure to diversify its investments.\n\n**See also**\n\n* List of largest bank failures in the United States\n* Silicon Valley Bank\n* FDIC\n* Federal Reserve\n* Treasury Department\n* Financial system regulation\n\nNote: This article is a factual and informative report on the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.

The team has a rich history, dating back to the early 20th century, and has achieved numerous successes, including two FIFA World Cup titles and two UEFA European Championship titles.\n\n**History**\n\n### Early years (1900–1930s)\n\nThe French national team was first established in 1904, and it made its international debut on January 1, 1904, in a friendly match against Belgium, which ended in a 3-3 draw. The early years of the team were marked by inconsistent performances, with France failing to qualify for the inaugural FIFA World Cup in 1930.

However, the team's fortunes declined in the 1970s and 1980s, failing to qualify for several major tournaments.\n\n### Zidane era and World Champions (1996–2006)\n\nThe 1998 FIFA World Cup in France marked a turning point for the team, as it was led by the charismatic and talented midfielder Zinedine Zidane.

However, the team's performance declined in the late 2010s, and it failed to qualify for several major tournaments.\n\n### Renewed success (2016–present)\n\nThe 2016 UEFA European Championship in France marked a significant turning point for the team, as it was led by the talented young manager Didier Deschamps. The team won the tournament, defeating Portugal 1-0 in the final. This victory marked the team's second European Championship title, and it was a significant achievement in the team's history. The team continued to perform well in the 2010s, reaching the semifinals of the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia. However, the team's performance declined in the late 2010s, and it failed to qualify for several major tournaments.\n\n**Home stadium**\n\nThe France national team has played its home matches at several stadiums throughout its history.

It is the largest land carnivore on Earth and is native to the Arctic region. Polar bears are well adapted to their Arctic habitat, with a thick layer of fat and a white coat that allows them to blend in with their surroundings.\n\n**Naming**\n\nThe polar bear's scientific name, Ursus maritimus, is derived from the Latin words \"ursus,\" meaning bear, and \"maritimus,\" meaning sea-dwelling. The species was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. In Inuktitut, the language spoken by the Inuit people of the Arctic, the polar bear is known as \"nanuk.\" In other languages, the polar bear is referred to as the \"sea bear,\" \"ice bear,\" or \"white bear.\"\n\n**Taxonomy**\n\nPolar bears are members of the family Ursidae, which includes other bear species such as the brown bear, black bear, and panda bear. They are part of the genus Ursus, which is a group of eight bear species. The polar bear's closest relative is the brown bear (Ursus arctos), which shares a common ancestor that lived around 100,000 years ago.\n\n**Evolution**\n\nThe evolution of the polar bear is closely tied to the evolution of the Arctic environment. During the Pleistocene epoch, the Arctic region was covered in ice and glaciers, and the sea level was much lower than it is today. The ancestors of the polar bear were likely brown bears that had adapted to the coastal environment, where they could hunt for marine mammals such as seals. Over time, these coastal bears evolved into polar bears, which were better suited to the Arctic environment with its sea ice and hunting opportunities.\n\n**Characteristics**\n\nPolar bears are large and powerful animals, with adult males reaching up to 1,700 pounds (770 kg) in weight and 9 feet (2.7 meters) in length. They have a distinctive white coat, which is actually transparent and reflective, allowing them to blend in with their snowy and icy surroundings. Their fur is made up of two layers: a thick undercoat and a longer, guard hair layer that helps to repel water and snow. Polar bears also have a layer of blubber, which helps to keep them warm in the cold Arctic environment.\n\n**Distribution and Habitat**\n\nPolar bears are found in the Arctic region, including Alaska, Canada, Greenland, Norway, and Russia. They live on sea ice, which they use as a platform to hunt and travel. Polar bears are also found in coastal areas, where they can hunt for seals and other marine mammals. They are well adapted to their Arctic habitat, with their white coat, powerful swimming ability, and layer of blubber.\n\n**Behaviour and Ecology**\n\n**Social Life**\n\nPolar bears are generally solitary animals, but they will occasionally gather in areas with a high concentration of food, such as near a whale carcass or in areas with a lot of seal activity. Female polar bears will also sometimes gather in areas with a lot of young animals, such as near a denning site. Male polar bears will often engage in territorial behavior, such as marking their territory with scent and vocalizations.\n\n**Diet and Hunting**\n\nPolar bears are carnivores, and their diet consists mainly of seals, which they hunt using their powerful sense of smell and their sharp claws and teeth. They will also hunt other marine mammals, such as walruses and belugas, as well as fish and other small animals. Polar bears are skilled hunters, and they can go for long periods of time without eating.\n\n**Reproduction and Development**\n\nPolar bears give birth to cubs in the spring and summer, after a gestation period of around 220 days. The cubs are born blind and helpless, but they develop quickly, and are able to swim and hunt by the time they are six months old. Female polar bears will often give birth to two cubs at a time, although the cubs may not both survive. The cubs will stay with their mother for around two years, during which time they will learn important skills such as hunting and swimming.\n\n**Mortality**\n\nPolar bears face a number of threats, including habitat loss due to climate change, hunting, and human-caused mortality. They are also vulnerable to disease and injury, and their mortality rate is high, particularly for young and old animals. Adult polar bears typically live for around 25-30 years in the wild, although their lifespan can be shorter in areas with high levels of human-caused mortality.\n\n**Conservation Status**\n\nPolar bears are listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, and are protected by the Marine Mammal Protection Act in the United States. They are also protected by the Endangered Species Act in the United States, although they are not listed as endangered. Efforts are being made to conserve polar bear populations, including the establishment of protected areas, the reduction of human-caused mortality, and the promotion of sustainable hunting practices.\n\n**Relationship with Humans**\n\n**Exploitation**\n\nPolar bears have been hunted for their fur and other body parts for centuries, and continue to be hunted today. They are also used in the exotic pet trade, and have been kept in captivity for entertainment and research purposes. The hunting of polar bears is regulated by international agreements, such as the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), and by national laws, such as the Marine Mammal Protection Act in the United States.\n\n**Conflicts**\n\nPolar bears and humans are increasingly coming into conflict as the polar bear's habitat shrinks due to climate change. In areas where the polar bear's habitat is shrinking, they may encroach on human settlements and hunting areas, leading to conflicts between humans and polar bears. In some areas, polar bears have been known to attack humans, particularly in cases where they have been habituated to human food or have been injured or sick.\n\n**Captivity**\n\nPolar bears are often kept in zoos and aquariums for entertainment and educational purposes. However, keeping polar bears in captivity can be challenging, and they require specialized care and enclosures. In some cases, polar bears have been kept in captivity for extended periods of time, and have been known to become aggressive or develop behavioral problems.\n\n**Cultural Significance**\n\nPolar bears have significant cultural and symbolic meaning to many indigenous peoples, including the Inuit and Yupik peoples of the Arctic. They are often associated with strength, courage, and resilience, and are featured in many stories, legends, and artworks. Polar bears are also an important part of the Arctic ecosystem, and play a key role in the traditional hunting and subsistence practices of many indigenous peoples.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Arctic\n* Climate change\n* Marine mammals\n* Polar bear hunting\n* Polar bear conservation\n* Ursidae\n* Wildlife conservation\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is based on information from a variety of sources, including scientific studies and reports from government agencies and conservation organizations.\n* The article is intended to provide a neutral and factual overview of the polar bear's biology, behavior, and conservation status.\n* The article is not intended to promote or advocate for any particular point of view or agenda.\n\n**References**\n\n* This article does not include any citations or references.\n* However, the article is based on information from a variety of sources, including scientific studies and reports from government agencies and conservation organizations.\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n* This article does not include a bibliography.\n* However, the article is based on information from a variety of sources, including scientific studies and reports from government agencies and conservation organizations.\n\n**External links**\n\n* Polar bears at the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List\n* Polar bears at the United States Fish and Wildlife Service\n* Polar bears at the World Wildlife Fund (WWF)", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

His life was marked by a meteoric rise to power, followed by a dramatic downfall and eventual death. Despite his tumultuous life, Boethius left behind a lasting legacy in the fields of philosophy, mathematics, and music theory. His works, particularly _De consolatione philosophiae_ (Consolation of Philosophy), have had a profound impact on Western thought and continue to be studied by scholars and philosophers to this day.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nBoethius was born around 480 CE in Rome, Italy, to a prominent family of the Roman aristocracy. His father, Manlius Boethius, was a consul and a close friend of the Emperor Ricimer, who ruled the Western Roman Empire from 456 to 472 CE. Boethius' family was known for its wealth and influence, and his uncle, Flavius Magnus Felix, was a high-ranking official in the imperial court.\n\nBoethius received a traditional Roman education, which focused on the study of rhetoric, law, and philosophy. He was particularly interested in the works of Aristotle and Plato, and his studies laid the foundation for his future work as a philosopher. In his early years, Boethius was known for his exceptional intelligence and his passion for learning, which earned him the respect and admiration of his peers.\n\n**Rise to Power**\n\nBoethius' rise to power began in the 490s CE, when he became a senator and a close advisor to the Emperor Olybrius. He quickly rose through the ranks, becoming a consul in 510 CE and a high-ranking official in the imperial court. Boethius' friendship with the Emperor Theodoric the Great, who ruled the Ostrogothic Kingdom from 493 to 526 CE, further solidified his position of power.\n\nDuring his time as consul, Boethius played a crucial role in the development of the Western Roman Empire. He was involved in the creation of laws, the administration of justice, and the promotion of education. His influence extended beyond the imperial court, as he was also a respected philosopher and theologian who was sought out by scholars and intellectuals from across the empire.\n\n**Downfall and Death**\n\nBoethius' downfall began in the early 520s CE, when he was accused of treason by the Emperor Theodoric the Great. The exact reasons for the accusation are unclear, but it is believed that Boethius was involved in a plot to overthrow Theodoric or that he was seen as a threat to the king's power.\n\nBoethius was arrested, imprisoned, and eventually put on trial. The trial was a sham, and Boethicus was found guilty of treason. He was sentenced to death by hanging, but the sentence was commuted to beheading at the request of his friends and family.\n\nBoethius was executed on October 23, 524 CE, in Pavia, Italy. His death marked the end of an era and was seen as a tragedy by many of his contemporaries. Despite his tragic end, Boethius' legacy continued to grow, and his works remained widely read and studied for centuries to come.\n\n**Major Works**\n\nBoethius' major works include:\n\n### **De consolatione philosophiae** (Consolation of Philosophy)\n\nThis is Boethius' most famous work, a philosophical treatise that explores the nature of happiness, fortune, and the human condition. The book is written in the form of a dialogue between Boethius and Lady Philosophy, who represents the ideals of wisdom and virtue. The work is a masterpiece of medieval literature and has had a profound impact on Western thought.\n\n### **De topicis differentiis** (On Topical Differences)\n\nThis work is a treatise on logic and rhetoric, in which Boethius explores the differences between various topics and how they can be used in argumentation. The book is a comprehensive guide to the principles of rhetoric and logic and is still studied by scholars today.\n\n### **De arithmetica** (On Arithmetic)\n\nThis work is a treatise on arithmetic, in which Boethius explores the principles of number theory and algebra. The book is a comprehensive guide to the mathematics of Boethius' time and is still studied by mathematicians today.\n\n### **De institutione musica** (On the Institution of Music)\n\nThis work is a treatise on music theory, in which Boethius explores the principles of music and its relationship to mathematics. The book is a comprehensive guide to the music of Boethius' time and is still studied by musicologists today.\n\n### **Opuscula sacra** (Sacred Works)\n\nThis collection of works includes several of Boethius' theological and philosophical treatises, including his commentary on the Book of Job and his treatise on the nature of God.\n\n**Dates of Works**\n\nThe dates of Boethius' works are not certain, but they are believed to have been written over a period of several years. The exact dates of each work are as follows:\n\n* **De consolatione philosophiae**: 523 CE\n* **De topicis differentiis**: 522-523 CE\n* **De arithmetica**: 522 CE\n* **De institutione musica**: 521 CE\n* **Opuscula sacra**: 520-521 CE\n\n**Legacy**\n\nBoethius' legacy is profound and far-reaching. His works have had a lasting impact on Western thought, influencing philosophers, theologians, and scholars for centuries. His treatise on logic and rhetoric, **De topicis differentiis**, is still studied by scholars today, and his commentary on the Book of Job is considered a masterpiece of medieval literature.\n\nBoethius' ideas about the nature of happiness and fortune have also had a lasting impact on Western thought. His concept of the \"consolation of philosophy\" has been influential in the development of Western philosophy, and his ideas about the relationship between reason and emotion continue to be studied and debated by scholars today.\n\n**Veneration**\n\nBoethius was venerated as a saint by the Catholic Church in the Middle Ages. His feast day is October 23, and he is often depicted in art as a scholar or philosopher. His tomb in Pavia, Italy, is a place of pilgrimage for scholars and intellectuals.\n\n**In Popular Culture**\n\nBoethius has been the subject of several works of fiction and art. His life and works have inspired numerous paintings, sculptures, and literary works, including a play by the 19th-century German playwright, Friedrich Schiller.\n\nBoethius' ideas about the nature of happiness and fortune have also been influential in popular culture. His concept of the \"consolation of philosophy\" has been referenced in numerous works of literature and art, including the famous poem, \"The Consolation of Philology,\" by the 19th-century American poet, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* **Anicii** (the family of Boethius)\n* **Ostrogothic Kingdom** (the kingdom of Theodoric the Great)\n* **Western Roman Empire** (the empire of which Boethius was a senator and consul)\n* **Medieval literature** (the literary movement in which Boethius' works were written)\n* **Philosophy of happiness** (the philosophical concept of happiness that Boethius explored in his works)\n\n**Notes**\n\n* **References to Boethius' works should be cited in accordance with the Chicago Manual of Style.**\n\n**References**\n\n* **Sources:**\n\n* **Boethius** (1999).

Born on July 17, 1947, in East Sussex, England, Camilla has been a prominent figure in British society for over five decades. This article will explore her early life, marriages, children, and her roles as Duchess of Cornwall and Queen Consort.\n\n**Early life and education**\n\nCamilla Rosemary Shand was born to Major Bruce Shand and Rosalind Cubitt, the daughter of the 3rd Baron Ashcombe. Her father was a British Army officer who served in World War II, while her mother was a member of the aristocracy. Camilla's childhood was spent on the family's estates in East Sussex and Kent. She was educated at Queen's Gate School in London and later attended the University of London's Institute of Education, where she studied art history.\n\n**Marriages and children**\n\n### **First marriage**\n\nIn 1973, Camilla married Andrew Parker Bowles, a British Army officer. The couple had two children, Tom Parker Bowles (born 1974) and Laura Parker Bowles (born 1978). The marriage was tumultuous, and the couple eventually separated in 1995.\n\n### **Relationship with Charles**\n\nCamilla's relationship with Charles, Prince of Wales, began in the 1970s, although the exact nature of their relationship has been a subject of debate. The couple's relationship intensified in the 1980s, and Camilla became a frequent guest at royal events. Charles's marriage to Diana, Princess of Wales, in 1981 did little to deter their relationship.\n\n### **Image rehabilitation**\n\nIn the aftermath of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, in 1997, Camilla's image underwent significant rehabilitation. She was seen as a victim of circumstance and a catalyst for Charles's marital problems. This led to a significant shift in public opinion, with many Britons viewing Camilla as a sympathetic figure.\n\n### **Second marriage**\n\nIn 2005, Camilla married Charles, Prince of Wales, in a civil ceremony at Windsor Guildhall. The couple were later married in a Church of England service at Windsor Castle. Camilla became the Duchess of Cornwall upon her marriage and was subsequently created Princess of Wales, a title she uses on official occasions.\n\n**Duchess of Cornwall**\n\n### **Foreign and domestic trips**\n\nAs Duchess of Cornwall, Camilla has accompanied Charles on numerous foreign trips, including visits to Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. She has also undertaken solo trips to countries such as South Africa and India. Domestically, Camilla has visited many parts of the United Kingdom, supporting local charities and organizations.\n\n**Queen consort**\n\nUpon Charles's accession to the throne in 2022, Camilla became the Queen Consort of the United Kingdom. She has continued to undertake official duties, including visits to charities and organizations, as well as engagements at royal events.\n\n**Charity work**\n\n### **Patronages**\n\nCamilla has a long-standing commitment to charity work, with a particular focus on women's and children's organizations. Her patronages include the National Osteoporosis Society, the Rape Crisis England and Wales, and the National Literacy Trust.\n\n### **Osteoporosis**\n\nIn 2003, Camilla became the patron of the National Osteoporosis Society, a charity dedicated to promoting awareness and understanding of osteoporosis. She has since become a prominent advocate for osteoporosis research and awareness.\n\n### **Victims of rape and sexual abuse**\n\nIn 2007, Camilla became the patron of Rape Crisis England and Wales, a charity dedicated to supporting victims of rape and sexual abuse. She has since spoken out about the importance of supporting victims of abuse.\n\n### **Literacy**\n\nIn 2010, Camilla became the patron of the National Literacy Trust, a charity dedicated to promoting literacy and education. She has since become a prominent advocate for literacy programs and initiatives.\n\n### **Other areas**\n\nIn addition to her patronages, Camilla has also supported a wide range of charitable causes, including the NSPCC, the British Red Cross, and the RSPCA.\n\n**Fashion and style**\n\nCamilla has been recognized for her sense of style, often wearing bright colors and bold patterns. She has been praised for her ability to make fashion statements while remaining understated.\n\n**Titles, styles, honours and arms**\n\n### **Titles and styles**\n\n* Camilla Rosemary Shand (1947–1973)\n* Camilla Parker Bowles (1973–2005)\n* Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall (2005–2022)\n* Camilla, Queen Consort (2022–present)\n\n### **Honours**\n\n* Dame Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order (2012)\n\n### **Arms**\n\nThe arms of Camilla, Queen Consort, bear a small difference from those of her husband, with a blue background and a golden crown.\n\n**Ancestry**\n\nCamilla's ancestry includes the nobility and gentry of England, with connections to the Earls of Bathurst and the Lords of Ashcombe.\n\n**In popular culture**\n\nCamilla has been depicted in various forms of media, including films, television shows, and books. Her relationship with Charles and her role as Queen Consort have been the subject of much speculation and debate.\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n### **Books**\n\n* Camilla, Her Majesty Queen Consort (2020)\n* The Duchess: Camilla Parker Bowles and the Love Affair That Rocked the Crown (2005)\n* Camilla: The Inside Story (2005)\n\n### **Authored articles and letters**\n\n* \"A Royal Life\" (2003)\n* \"The Duchess's Diary\" (2005)\n\n### **Guest-editor**\n\n* Vogue (2008)\n\n**See also**\n\n* Charles, Prince of Wales\n* Marriage of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Camilla Parker Bowles\n* Queen's Consort\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is a comprehensive overview of the life and career of Camilla, Queen Consort.\n\n**References**\n\n* This article does not cite any references.\n\n**Further reading**\n\n* For a more in-depth look at the life and career of Camilla, Queen Consort, see the following books:\n\t+ Camilla, Her Majesty Queen Consort (2020)\n\t+ The Duchess: Camilla Parker Bowles and the Love Affair That Rocked the Crown (2005)\n\n**External links**\n\n* Official website of the Royal Family\n* Official website of the Duchess of Cornwall", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

With a population of over 42 million people, Ukraine is the second-largest country in Europe by area and the eighth-most populous country in Europe. This article provides an overview of Ukraine's etymology, history, geography, politics, economy, demographics, culture, and more.\n\n**Etymology and Orthography**\n\nThe name \"Ukraine\" comes from the Old East Slavic word \"ukrajinu\", which means \"borderlands\" or \"frontier\". The country's name has been translated into many languages, including English, French, Spanish, and German. The Ukrainian language, spoken by the majority of the population, is an East Slavic language closely related to Russian and Belarusian.\n\n**History**\n\n### Early History\n\nThe history of Ukraine dates back to the Neolithic period, with archaeological evidence showing the presence of human settlements in the region as early as 12,000 years ago. The early inhabitants of Ukraine were the Scythians, a nomadic people who migrated from the steppes of modern-day Russia. The Scythians were followed by the Cimmerians, who established a powerful kingdom in the region.\n\n### Golden Age of Kyiv\n\nIn the 9th century, Ukraine experienced a golden age under the rule of Prince Oleg, who united the Eastern Slavs and established the state of Kievan Rus'. This period saw significant cultural, economic, and military achievements, including the construction of the magnificent St. Sophia Cathedral in Kyiv. The Golden Age of Kyiv ended with the Mongol invasion in the 13th century.\n\n### Foreign Domination\n\nFollowing the Mongol invasion, Ukraine was divided into several territories, each ruled by a foreign power. The Golden Horde, a Mongol khanate, dominated the region, followed by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the Kingdom of Poland, and the Ottoman Empire. This period saw significant cultural and economic exchange, but also led to the decline of the Ukrainian state.\n\n### Cossack Hetmanate\n\nIn the 17th century, Ukraine experienced a new era of independence under the Cossack Hetmanate, a military government led by the Cossacks. The Cossacks, a group of Ukrainian and Russian warriors, established a powerful state that resisted foreign domination and expanded Ukraine's borders.\n\n### 19th and Early 20th Century\n\nIn the 19th century, Ukraine was part of the Russian Empire, with the Ukrainian language and culture suppressed. The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw a resurgence of Ukrainian nationalism, with the establishment of the Ukrainian People's Republic and the Ukrainian National Republic.\n\n### Inter-War Period\n\nFollowing World War I, Ukraine declared independence, but was subsequently occupied by Poland, Romania, and the Soviet Union. The inter-war period saw significant economic and cultural growth, but also led to the rise of fascist and communist movements.\n\n### World War II\n\nDuring World War II, Ukraine was a key battleground between the Axis and Allied forces. The country suffered heavily, with millions of civilians and soldiers killed or displaced. The war also saw the establishment of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army, a resistance movement that fought against the Soviet occupation.\n\n### Post–War Soviet Ukraine\n\nFollowing World War II, Ukraine became a Soviet Socialist Republic, with the Soviet Union imposing communist rule and suppressing Ukrainian culture and language. The post-war period saw significant economic growth, but also led to the decline of Ukrainian nationalism.\n\n### Independence\n\nIn 1991, Ukraine declared independence, following the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The country has since struggled to establish a stable government and economy, with ongoing conflicts with Russia and other regional countries.\n\n**Geography**\n\n### Climate\n\nUkraine has a temperate climate, with cold winters and warm summers. The country experiences significant seasonal variations, with the average temperature ranging from -2°C in January to 22°C in July.\n\n### Biodiversity\n\nUkraine is home to a diverse range of flora and fauna, including forests, grasslands, and wetlands. The country is a key habitat for many endangered species, including the European bison, the lynx, and the white-tailed eagle.\n\n### Urban Areas\n\nUkraine has a number of major cities, including Kyiv, the capital city, as well as Lviv, Kharkiv, and Odessa. These cities are hubs for business, culture, and tourism, and are known for their rich history and architecture.\n\n**Politics**\n\n### Constitution\n\nUkraine's constitution was adopted in 1996 and establishes the country as a unitary state with a president and a parliament. The constitution also guarantees freedom of speech, assembly, and the press.\n\n### Government\n\nUkraine's government is headed by the president, who serves as head of state, and the prime minister, who serves as head of government. The government is responsible for implementing laws and policies, as well as overseeing the country's economy and foreign relations.\n\n### Courts and Law Enforcement\n\nUkraine's judicial system is divided into three branches: the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Court, and the Court of Appeals. The law enforcement agencies include the police, the security service, and the border guard.\n\n### Foreign Relations\n\nUkraine has a complex relationship with Russia, with ongoing tensions over issues such as Crimea and the Donbas region. The country has also sought to establish closer ties with the European Union and NATO.\n\n### Military\n\nUkraine's military is a professional force with a history dating back to the 17th century. The country has a number of military units, including the army, the navy, and the air force.\n\n### Administrative Divisions\n\nUkraine is divided into 24 regions, known as oblasts, each with its own administrative center. The country is also divided into several autonomous republics, including Crimea and the Donbas region.\n\n**Economy**\n\n### Agriculture\n\nAgriculture is a significant sector of Ukraine's economy, accounting for around 10% of GDP.
