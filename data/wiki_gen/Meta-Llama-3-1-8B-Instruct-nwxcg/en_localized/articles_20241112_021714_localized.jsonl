He is best known for his influential work, _De consolatione philosophiae_ (On the Consolation of Philosophy), which has been a major source of inspiration for philosophers, theologians, and writers throughout the centuries.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nBoethius was born around 480 CE in Rome, Italy. His family was of noble descent, and his father, Flavius Boethius, was a high-ranking official in the Roman Empire. Boethius' mother, Rusticiana, was a member of the Anicia family, which was also of high social standing. Boethius' exact birthdate is unknown, but it is believed to be sometime between 470 and 480 CE.\n\nBoethius received a classical education, studying literature, philosophy, and law. He was particularly drawn to the works of Plato and Aristotle, which had a profound impact on his philosophical thought. Boethius' early life was marked by his interest in knowledge and his desire to serve his country.\n\n**Rise to Power**\n\nBoethius' rise to power was rapid and remarkable. In 510 CE, he was appointed as the Magister Officiorum (Master of Offices) by King Theodoric the Great, who had recently conquered Rome. Boethius' appointment was a testament to his intelligence, eloquence, and administrative skills. As Magister Officiorum, Boethius was responsible for overseeing the administration of the Roman Empire and advising the king on various matters.\n\nBoethius' tenure as Magister Officiorum was marked by his efforts to promote the welfare of the Roman people. He implemented various reforms, including the establishment of a new system of taxation and the promotion of trade and commerce. Boethius' success in this role earned him the respect and admiration of the Roman people.\n\n**Downfall and Death**\n\nBoethius' downfall began in 523 CE, when he was accused of conspiring against King Theodoric. The charges against him were likely fabricated, and Boethius was subjected to a sham trial. Despite his protests of innocence, Boethius was found guilty and sentenced to death.\n\nBoethius was imprisoned in Pavia, where he was subjected to physical and psychological torture. Despite his suffering, Boethius continued to write and reflect on his philosophical ideas. In his final days, he wrote _De consolatione philosophiae_, which is a testament to his enduring spirit and commitment to his philosophical ideals.\n\nBoethius was executed by strangulation in 524 CE, at the age of 43 or 44. His death was a tragic event that shocked the Roman people and sparked widespread outrage.\n\n**Major Works**\n\nBoethius' major works include:\n\n### **De consolatione philosophiae**\n\n_De consolatione philosophiae_ (On the Consolation of Philosophy) is a philosophical treatise that explores the nature of evil, the nature of good, and the nature of reality. The work is written in the form of a dialogue between Boethius and Lady Philosophy, who serves as his guide and mentor.\n\nIn this work, Boethius argues that evil is not a substance or a thing, but rather the absence of good. He also argues that the universe is governed by a rational and orderly principle, which he calls the \"Will of God.\" Boethius' central argument is that even in the midst of adversity and suffering, one can find comfort and solace in the knowledge of the goodness and order of the universe.\n\n### **De topicis differentiis**\n\n_De topicis differentiis_ (On the Topics) is a philosophical work that explores the nature of reasoning and argumentation. In this work, Boethius discusses the various topics or subjects of discourse, and provides a systematic treatment of the modes of reasoning and argumentation.\n\nBoethius' discussion of the topics is based on the idea that there are certain fundamental principles and concepts that underlie all reasoning and argumentation. He identifies seven topics, which are:\n\n1. Definition\n2. Divisions\n3. Comparisons\n4. Differences\n5. Similarities\n6. Antitheses\n7. Hypotheticals\n\nBoethius' discussion of the topics is a major contribution to the development of Western logic and philosophy.\n\n### **De arithmetica**\n\n_De arithmetica_ (On Arithmetic) is a mathematical work that explores the nature of number and arithmetic. In this work, Boethius discusses the principles of arithmetic, including the concept of number, the concept of proportion, and the concept of ratio.\n\nBoethius' discussion of arithmetic is based on the idea that numbers are the building blocks of reality. He argues that numbers are not just abstract concepts, but are rooted in the physical world and are used to describe the relationships between things.\n\n### **De institutione musica**\n\n_De institutione musica_ (On the Institution of Music) is a musical work that explores the nature of music and its relationship to the universe. In this work, Boethius discusses the principles of music, including the concept of harmony, the concept of rhythm, and the concept of melody.\n\nBoethius' discussion of music is based on the idea that music is a form of divine language that reflects the harmony and order of the universe. He argues that music is a way of expressing the beauty and wonder of the world, and that it has the power to bring people together and to inspire them to greatness.\n\n### **Opuscula sacra**\n\n_Opuscula sacra_ (Sacred Works) is a collection of philosophical and theological writings that explore the nature of God and the universe. In this work, Boethius discusses various topics, including the nature of God, the nature of the soul, and the nature of the universe.\n\nBoethius' discussion of God and the universe is based on the idea that there is a rational and orderly principle that governs the universe. He argues that this principle is the Will of God, and that it is the source of all creation and the ultimate purpose of all existence.\n\n**Dates of Works**\n\nThe dates of Boethius' works are not precisely known. However, based on internal evidence and historical records, it is possible to estimate the dates of his major works as follows:\n\n* _De consolatione philosophiae_: 523-524 CE\n* _De topicis differentiis_: 522-523 CE\n* _De arithmetica_: 520-522 CE\n* _De institutione musica_: 521-522 CE\n* _Opuscula sacra_: 523-524 CE\n\n**Legacy**\n\nBoethius' legacy is immense. His works have had a profound impact on Western philosophy and Christianity, and have influenced some of the greatest thinkers of all time. His ideas about the nature of evil, the nature of good, and the nature of reality have shaped the way that people think about the world and their place in it.\n\nBoethius' influence can be seen in the works of medieval philosophers such as Thomas Aquinas and Duns Scotus, and in the writings of Renaissance humanists such as Petrarch and Boccaccio. His ideas have also influenced modern thinkers such as Immanuel Kant and Friedrich Nietzsche.\n\n**Veneration**\n\nBoethius was venerated as a saint in the medieval period, and his feast day is celebrated on October 23rd. He is often depicted in art as a philosopher or a martyr, and his writings have been translated into many languages.\n\n**In Popular Culture**\n\nBoethius' life and works have been the subject of many literary and artistic works. His story has been retold in novels, plays, and poems, and his ideas have been explored in music and film.\n\nSome notable examples of Boethius' influence in popular culture include:\n\n* The novel \"The Consolation of Boethius\" by Robert Lowell\n* The play \"Boethius\" by Jean Giraudoux\n* The opera \"Boethius\" by Gian Francesco Malipiero\n* The novel \"The Consolation of Philosophy\" by Chaim Grade\n\n**See Also**\n\n* History of Western Philosophy\n* Medieval Philosophy\n* Renaissance Humanism\n* Philosophy of Logic\n* Philosophy of Metaphysics\n* Philosophy of Ethics\n* Philosophy of Music\n\n**Notes**\n\n* Boethius' works have been translated into many languages, including Latin, Greek, French, German, Italian, Spanish, and English.\n* Boethius' ideas have influenced many fields, including philosophy, literature, music, and art.\n* Boethius' legacy continues to be felt today, and his works remain a vital part of Western cultural heritage.\n\n**References**\n\n* Boethius.

It is designed to simulate human-like conversations, answering questions and providing information on a wide range of topics. Since its release in 2022, ChatGPT has gained significant attention and popularity for its advanced language capabilities and user-friendly interface.\n\n**Training**\n------------\n\nChatGPT was trained on a large dataset of text from the internet, including books, articles, and websites. The training process involved using a variant of the transformer architecture, which is a type of neural network designed for natural language processing tasks. The model was trained on a massive dataset of text, which allowed it to learn patterns and relationships in language.\n\n**Features and limitations**\n---------------------------\n\n### Features\n\nChatGPT has several features that make it a powerful conversational AI:\n\n* **Conversational interface**: ChatGPT uses a conversational interface, allowing users to engage in natural-sounding conversations with the chatbot.\n* **Knowledge base**: ChatGPT has access to a vast knowledge base, which it can draw upon to answer questions and provide information on a wide range of topics.\n* **Contextual understanding**: ChatGPT has the ability to understand the context of a conversation, allowing it to provide more accurate and relevant responses.\n* **Emotional understanding**: ChatGPT can recognize and respond to emotions, making it a more empathetic and engaging conversational partner.\n\n### Limitations\n\nDespite its advanced features, ChatGPT has several limitations:\n\n* **Lack of common sense**: While ChatGPT has been trained on a vast amount of text data, it often lacks the common sense and real-world experience that humans take for granted.\n* **Biased responses**: ChatGPT can produce biased responses, particularly if it has been trained on biased data or if it is not adequately diversified.\n* **Limited domain knowledge**: While ChatGPT has access to a vast knowledge base, it may not have the same level of domain-specific knowledge as a human expert in a particular field.\n\n### Jailbreaking\n\nIn December 2022, a community of developers discovered a way to \"jailbreak\" ChatGPT, allowing them to access the underlying code and modify it to perform new tasks. This has sparked debate about the potential risks and benefits of allowing users to modify a complex AI system like ChatGPT.\n\n**Service**\n------------\n\nChatGPT is available as a free service, with optional upgrades to ChatGPT Plus. ChatGPT Plus offers additional features, including:\n\n* **Priority access**: Users with ChatGPT Plus have priority access to the chatbot, allowing them to skip the queue and engage in conversations more quickly.\n* **Enhanced features**: ChatGPT Plus users have access to enhanced features, such as the ability to customize the chatbot's appearance and behavior.\n\n### Mobile app\n\nChatGPT is available as a mobile app for both iOS and Android devices. The app allows users to engage in conversations with the chatbot on-the-go, using a variety of features, including voice input and offline access.\n\n### Software development support\n\nChatGPT provides software development support for developers who want to integrate the chatbot into their applications. This includes APIs, SDKs, and other tools, allowing developers to build custom interfaces and integrate ChatGPT with other services.\n\n### March 2023 security breach\n\nIn March 2023, ChatGPT suffered a security breach, in which hackers gained unauthorized access to user data and chat logs. OpenAI has since taken steps to address the breach and improve the chatbot's security.\n\n### Languages\n\nChatGPT is available in multiple languages, including English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, and many others. The chatbot is able to understand and respond in each language, using a combination of machine translation and human translation.\n\n### GPT Store\n\nChatGPT has access to the GPT Store, a repository of pre-trained models and fine-tuned models developed by the OpenAI community. The GPT Store allows users to access a wide range of models, each with its own unique features and capabilities.\n\n### GPT-4\n\nChatGPT is based on the GPT-4 model, a variant of the transformer architecture that has been fine-tuned for conversational AI tasks. GPT-4 has been designed to be more accurate and engaging than its predecessor, GPT-3.\n\n### GPT-4o\n\nGPT-4o is a variant of the GPT-4 model that has been designed for online conversations.

However, their peaceful life is disrupted by the impending end of the world, known as Ragnarök, which is prophesied to occur when the fire giant Surtur breaks free from his prison.

The style is named after its most famous exponent, Andrea Palladio, a Venetian architect who wrote extensively on the subject and designed many buildings that embodied the principles of the style.\n\n# Palladio's Architecture\n\nPalladio's architecture is based on the principles of Vitruvius, a Roman architect who wrote about the ideal proportions of a building in his book De Architectura. Palladio believed that a building should be designed according to these principles, which he outlined in his book I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura (The Four Books of Architecture). In this book, he described the ideal proportions of a building, including the use of columns, pilasters, and arches.\n\nPalladio's buildings often featured a central pavilion surrounded by a colonnade, which was inspired by the ancient Greek and Roman temples. He also used a system of proportion that was based on the golden ratio, which he believed would create a sense of harmony and balance in a building.\n\nSome of Palladio's most famous buildings include the Villa Capra, also known as the Villa Rotonda, and the Teatro Olimpico, which is considered one of the greatest examples of Palladian architecture. Palladio's designs were not limited to buildings; he also designed gardens and urban spaces that were characteristic of the style.\n\n# Venetian and Palladian Windows\n\nVenetian windows, also known as Palladian windows, are a type of window that is characteristic of the Palladian style. They are characterized by a series of arches or columns that support a pediment, which is a triangular piece of masonry that is placed above the arches or columns. The Venetian window is often used to provide natural light and ventilation to a building, while also adding a decorative element to the facade.\n\nThe Venetian window was a key element of Palladian architecture, and it was often used in conjunction with other classical elements, such as columns and pilasters. Palladio believed that the Venetian window was an essential component of a building, as it allowed the interior to be flooded with natural light and provided a sense of connection to the exterior.\n\nThe Venetian window was also used in other parts of Europe, particularly in England and Ireland, where it became a characteristic feature of the Palladian style.\n\n# Early Palladianism\n\nEarly Palladianism was a movement that emerged in the 17th century, shortly after Palladio's death. It was characterized by the use of classical elements, symmetry, and proportion, which were all key features of Palladian architecture.\n\nEarly Palladianism was often associated with the English aristocracy, who were looking for a way to express their wealth and status through architecture. Palladian buildings were often built on large estates, where the owner could showcase their wealth and power.\n\nSome of the most famous examples of early Palladianism include the work of Inigo Jones, an English architect who was heavily influenced by Palladio's designs. Jones designed many buildings that embodied the principles of Palladian architecture, including the Queen's House in Greenwich Park.\n\n# Neo-Palladianism\n\nNeo-Palladianism was a movement that emerged in the 18th century, which saw a renewed interest in Palladian architecture. The movement was characterized by the use of classical elements, symmetry, and proportion, which were all key features of Palladian architecture.\n\nNeo-Palladianism was often associated with the English aristocracy, who were looking for a way to express their wealth and status through architecture. Palladian buildings were often built on large estates, where the owner could showcase their wealth and power.\n\nSome of the most famous examples of neo-Palladianism include the work of Robert Adam, an English architect who was heavily influenced by Palladio's designs. Adam designed many buildings that embodied the principles of Palladian architecture, including the Adelphi Buildings in London.\n\n## English Palladian Architecture\n\nEnglish Palladian architecture was a style of building design that emerged in the 17th and 18th centuries. It was characterized by the use of classical elements, symmetry, and proportion, which were all key features of Palladian architecture.\n\nEnglish Palladian architecture was often associated with the English aristocracy, who were looking for a way to express their wealth and status through architecture. Palladian buildings were often built on large estates, where the owner could showcase their wealth and power.\n\nSome of the most famous examples of English Palladian architecture include the work of Inigo Jones, who designed many buildings that embodied the principles of Palladian architecture, including the Queen's House in Greenwich Park.\n\n## Irish Palladian Architecture\n\nIrish Palladian architecture was a style of building design that emerged in the 18th century. It was characterized by the use of classical elements, symmetry, and proportion, which were all key features of Palladian architecture.\n\nIrish Palladian architecture was often associated with the Irish aristocracy, who were looking for a way to express their wealth and status through architecture. Palladian buildings were often built on large estates, where the owner could showcase their wealth and power.\n\nSome of the most famous examples of Irish Palladian architecture include the work of James Hoban, who designed many buildings that embodied the principles of Palladian architecture, including the Presidential Palace in Dublin.\n\n## North American Palladian Architecture\n\nNorth American Palladian architecture was a style of building design that emerged in the 18th century. It was characterized by the use of classical elements, symmetry, and proportion, which were all key features of Palladian architecture.\n\nNorth American Palladian architecture was often associated with the American colonial aristocracy, who were looking for a way to express their wealth and status through architecture. Palladian buildings were often built on large estates, where the owner could showcase their wealth and power.\n\nSome of the most famous examples of North American Palladian architecture include the work of Thomas Jefferson, who designed many buildings that embodied the principles of Palladian architecture, including his home at Monticello.\n\n## Palladianism Elsewhere\n\nPalladianism was not limited to Europe and North America; it was also found in other parts of the world, including Asia and South America.\n\nIn Asia, Palladianism was often associated with the colonial powers, who were looking for a way to express their wealth and status through architecture. Palladian buildings were often built in countries such as India and China, where the colonial powers had established their dominance.\n\nIn South America, Palladianism was often associated with the aristocracy, who were looking for a way to express their wealth and status through architecture. Palladian buildings were often built on large estates, where the owner could showcase their wealth and power.\n\n# Legacy\n\nPalladian architecture has had a lasting impact on building design, and its principles continue to be used today. The use of classical elements, symmetry, and proportion has become a standard feature of many building styles, from modernist to postmodernist.\n\nPalladianism has also had a profound impact on the way we think about space and function in buildings. The emphasis on proportion and balance has led to the creation of buildings that are not only aesthetically pleasing but also functional and efficient.\n\n# See Also\n\n* Andrea Palladio\n* I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura\n* Villa Capra\n* Teatro Olimpico\n* Inigo Jones\n* Robert Adam\n* James Hoban\n* Thomas Jefferson\n* Monticello\n\n# Notes, References and Sources\n\n## Notes\n\n* Palladian architecture was not a single style, but a movement that encompassed many different styles and forms.\n* The Palladian style was not limited to Europe and North America, but was also found in other parts of the world.\n* Palladian architecture has had a lasting impact on building design, and its principles continue to be used today.\n\n## References\n\n* Palladio, A.

The club was founded in 1889 and has a rich history spanning over 130 years. Bath City has a loyal fan base and has played in various divisions of the English football league system.\n\n**History**\n\n### Formation and Early Years (1889–1925)\n\nBath City Football Club was formed in 1889 by a group of local football enthusiasts. The club initially played friendly matches against other local teams before joining the Western Football League in 1899. During this period, the team played at various grounds in the city, including the North Parade Ground, which was the club's first home. The team experienced moderate success during this period, winning the Western Football League in 1903.\n\n### Large Crowds and Missing Out on Football League (1925–1958)\n\nIn 1925, Bath City joined the Southern League, which was a more prestigious competition than the Western Football League. The team experienced a significant increase in popularity, with average attendances exceeding 5,000. However, despite their success, the club narrowly missed out on election to the Football League on two occasions. This led to a period of frustration for the club and its fans, who felt that the team's potential was being overlooked.\n\n### Glory, Yoyo Years and Nationwide Football (1958–1996)\n\nThe 1958s saw a significant transformation in the club's fortunes. Bath City won the Southern League championship in 1958 and was elected to the Football League for the first time. The team experienced several seasons of success, including a promotion to the Third Division in 1960. However, the club struggled to maintain its top-flight status and experienced several relegations, earning the nickname \"yoyo club.\"\n\n### Decline and Subsequent Relegation (1996–2017)\n\nIn the 1990s, the club's fortunes began to decline. Bath City was relegated from the Football Conference in 1996 and struggled to regain its top-flight status. The team experienced several seasons of financial difficulties, which led to a decline in attendance and a loss of talent. In 2017, the club was relegated from the National League South and was forced to play in the Southern League Division One South & West.\n\n### The Gill Era (2017–present)\n\nIn 2017, Kevin Gill took over as manager of Bath City. Under his leadership, the team has experienced a significant turnaround in fortune. The club has improved its financial situation and has attracted a new generation of fans. Bath City has also invested in its youth academy, which has produced several talented young players.\n\n**Badge**\n\nThe club's badge features a shield with the city's crest in the center. The crest depicts a swan, which is a reference to the city's connection to the River Avon. The badge also features a pair of red and white stripes, which represent the club's colors. The badge has undergone several changes since the club's formation, with the most recent update occurring in 2017.\n\n**Stadiums**\n\n### 1889: The North Parade Ground\n\nThe North Parade Ground was the club's first home. However, the ground was not suitable for football, and the team played friendly matches at various other locations in the city.\n\n### 1900–1919: Belvoir Castle\n\nIn 1900, the club moved to Belvoir Castle, which was a more suitable ground for football. The ground was also home to a cricket pitch and was used for other sports.\n\n### 1919–1932: Lambridge\n\nIn 1919, the club moved to Lambridge, which was a larger ground than Belvoir Castle. The ground was also used for other sports, including rugby.\n\n### 1932–present: Twerton Park\n\nIn 1932, the club moved to Twerton Park, which has been its home ever since. The ground has undergone several renovations and expansions, including the installation of floodlights in 1964.\n\n**Support**\n\nBath City has a loyal fan base, with supporters' clubs in several countries around the world. The club's fans are known for their dedication and passion, with many attending matches at Twerton Park. The club also has a strong community outreach program, which provides support to local charities and organizations.\n\n**Records**\n\n* Highest attendance: 10,000 (v.

He reigned from 6 March 1964 until 1 June 1973, when a military coup led to the abolition of the monarchy.\n\n**Early Life**\n\n**World War II and the exile of the royal family**\n\nConstantine II was born in Athens, Greece, as the son of King Paul and Queen Frederica. His birth occurred during a tumultuous period in Greek history, as the country was being occupied by Axis powers during World War II. Constantine's family was forced into exile in 1941, first to Egypt and then to South Africa, where they became close to the British royal family.\n\n**After World War II and return to Greece**\n\nFollowing the war, Constantine's family returned to Greece, where they played a key role in shaping the country's post-war politics. In 1947, Constantine's father, King Paul, became the ruler of Greece, and Constantine began to take on more prominent roles within the royal family.\n\n**Crown Prince**\n\n**Education**\n\nConstantine II received his primary education at the private Athens College, followed by studies at the Royal Military College at Sandhurst in the United Kingdom. He later attended the University of Athens, where he studied economics and law.\n\n**Sailing and the Olympic Games**\n\nConstantine II was an accomplished sailor and represented Greece in the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, Italy, where he competed in the 5.5 Metre class. He went on to serve as the commodore of the Hellenic Navy Sailing Team and was also a member of the International Olympic Committee.\n\n**Reign**\n\n**Accession and marriage**\n\nConstantine II ascended to the throne on 6 March 1964, following the death of his father, King Paul. He married Princess Anne-Marie of Denmark on 18 September 1964, and the couple had three children: Crown Prince Pavlos, Crown Princess Pavlina, and Prince Nikolaos.\n\n**Apostasia of 1965**\n\nThe early years of Constantine's reign were marked by controversy, particularly surrounding a series of constitutional reforms proposed by the government. The reforms, which aimed to reduce the powers of the monarch and increase those of the prime minister, were met with opposition from the royal family, leading to the so-called \"apostasia\" (Greek for \"abandonment\" or \"withdrawal\") of 1965, in which the king and his family briefly withdrew their support for the government.\n\n**Greek dictatorship of 1967–1974**\n\nIn 1967, a military coup led by Colonel Georgios Papadopoulos overthrew the government and established a dictatorship in Greece. Constantine II, who had been on a state visit to London at the time of the coup, was forced into exile.\n\n**Royal countercoup of 13 December 1967 and exile**\n\nConstantine II attempted to return to Greece and restore democracy in a countercoup on 13 December 1967, but the attempt failed, and he was forced to flee the country once again. He spent the next several years in exile, living primarily in London and Rome.\n\n**Restoration of democracy and the referendum**\n\nIn 1973, a new military government came to power in Greece, which eventually led to the restoration of democracy in 1974. In a national referendum held on 8 December 1974, the Greek people voted to abolish the monarchy, and Constantine II was forced to abdicate.\n\n**Life in exile after 1974**\n\n**Abortive conspiracies**\n\nFollowing his exile, Constantine II was involved in several abortive conspiracies to restore the monarchy in Greece. In 1981, he was involved in a plot to overthrow the government of Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, but the attempt was unsuccessful.\n\n**1993 visit to Greece**\n\nIn 1993, Constantine II returned to Greece, where he was met with a mixture of applause and protests. He was allowed to return to his family's estate in Tatoi, where he lived until his death in 2023.\n\n**Legal quarrels over the royal properties**\n\nFollowing his return to Greece, Constantine II was involved in a series of legal disputes over the ownership of the royal family's properties, including the Tatoi estate. He ultimately lost several court cases, which led to the sale of many of the properties.\n\n**Later Life**\n\n**Death**\n\nConstantine II died on 10 January 2023, at the age of 82, in Athens, Greece. His death was met with a mixture of sadness and celebration, as he was remembered by many for his dedication to the Greek monarchy and his efforts to restore democracy in the country.\n\n**Issue**\n\nConstantine II had three children:\n\n* Crown Prince Pavlos (born 20 May 1967)\n* Crown Princess Pavlina (born 1968, deceased 1968)\n* Prince Nikolaos (born 1 October 1969)\n\n**Ancestry**\n\nConstantine II's ancestry is as follows:\n\n* Parents: King Paul and Queen Frederica\n* Grandparents: King George II and Queen Elisabeth\n* Great-grandparents: King Constantine I and Princess Sophia of Prussia\n* Great-great-grandparents: King George I and Grand Duchess Olga Constantinovna of Russia\n\n**Titles, styles and honours**\n\n**Titles and styles**\n\n* 2 June 1940 – 6 March 1964: His Serene Highness Prince Constantine\n* 6 March 1964 – 1 June 1973: His Majesty King Constantine II of the Hellenes\n* 1 June 1973 – 10 January 2023: His Majesty King Constantine II (in exile)\n\n**National honours**\n\n* Grand Cross of the Order of the White Eagle\n* Grand Cross of the Order of the Phoenix\n* Grand Commander of the Order of the Red Eagle\n* Grand Commander of the Order of the Lion and Sun\n\n**Foreign honours**\n\n### Awards\n\n*  Grand Cordon of the Order of the Oak Crown (Luxembourg)\n*  Grand Cordon of the Order of the White Rose (Sweden)\n*  Grand Cordon of the Order of the Chrysanthemum (Japan)\n*  Grand Cordon of the Order of the Golden Heart (Egypt)\n*  Grand Cordon of the Order of the Golden Kite (Egypt)\n*  Grand Cordon of the Order of the Two Niles (Egypt)\n\n**See also**\n\n* Greek monarchy\n* Papadopoulos regime\n* Greek royal family\n\n**References**\n\n* Alexandropoulos, G.

This concept is observed in both animals and humans, and is influenced by a variety of factors including the animal's or hunter's physical and mental abilities, the environment, and the type of prey being hunted.\n\n**Hunting Success in Animals**\n\nIn animals, hunting success is often measured by the number of successful hunts per unit of time, such as the number of kills per day or week. This can vary greatly depending on the species and its specific characteristics.\n\n### List of Animals by Hunting Success Rate\n\nThe following is a list of some animals known for their high hunting success rates:\n\n* Lion: 10-20 kills per 100 hunting attempts\n* Leopard: 5-10 kills per 100 hunting attempts\n* Cheetah: 2-5 kills per 100 hunting attempts\n* Wolf: 10-20 kills per 100 hunting attempts\n* Polar bear: 5-10 kills per 100 hunting attempts\n\n### Reasons for High Hunting Success\n\nSeveral factors contribute to an animal's high hunting success rate, including:\n\n* Physical characteristics, such as strength, speed, and agility\n* Hunting methods, such as stalking, ambushing, or chasing\n* Environmental adaptations, such as camouflage or specialized senses\n* Social behavior, such as cooperation or communication with other hunters\n\n**Kill Rates**\n\nKill rates are a measure of an animal's or hunter's success in hunting and killing prey. This can be expressed as a percentage of successful hunts per unit of time.\n\n* Lion: 20-30% successful hunts per day\n* Leopard: 10-20% successful hunts per day\n* Cheetah: 5-10% successful hunts per day\n* Wolf: 20-30% successful hunts per day\n* Polar bear: 10-20% successful hunts per day\n\n**Factors Influencing Success**\n\nSeveral factors can influence an animal's or hunter's hunting success, including:\n\n### Selective Feeding\n\nSelective feeding is the practice of hunting and consuming specific prey species or individuals. This can be influenced by factors such as availability, nutritional value, and vulnerability.\n\n* Animals that are highly selective feeders, such as lions and leopards, tend to have lower hunting success rates\n* Animals that are opportunistic feeders, such as wolves and polar bears, tend to have higher hunting success rates\n\n### Social and Solitary Predators\n\nSocial and solitary predators exhibit different hunting behaviors and strategies.\n\n* Social predators, such as wolves and lions, often hunt in groups and have higher hunting success rates\n* Solitary predators, such as leopards and cheetahs, often hunt alone and have lower hunting success rates\n\n### Hunting Methods\n\nDifferent animal species and human hunters employ various hunting methods, including:\n\n* Stalking: approaching prey undetected\n* Ambushing: lying in wait for prey\n* Chasing: pursuing prey over long distances\n* Snaring: using traps or snares to capture prey\n\n### Environmental Influences\n\nEnvironmental factors, such as vegetation, climate, and terrain, can influence hunting success.\n\n* Vegetative cover, such as dense forests or grasslands, can make it easier or harder for animals to hunt and be hunted\n* Climate and weather conditions, such as cold temperatures or heavy rain, can affect an animal's or hunter's ability to hunt\n\n### Vegetative Cover\n\nVegetative cover, such as dense forests or grasslands, can make it easier or harder for animals to hunt and be hunted.\n\n* Dense forests can provide shelter and concealment for animals, making it harder for hunters to track and kill them\n* Grasslands can provide open terrain for animals to hunt and be hunted, making it easier for hunters to track and kill them\n\n**In Human Hunters**\n\nIn human hunters, hunting success is often influenced by factors such as experience, skill, and equipment.\n\n### Hunting Success in Humans\n\nHuman hunting success is influenced by factors such as experience, skill, and equipment.\n\n* Experienced and skilled hunters tend to have higher hunting success rates\n* Hunters who use advanced equipment, such as binoculars or rifles, tend to have higher hunting success rates\n* Hunters who hunt in areas with high prey populations and minimal human disturbance tend to have higher hunting success rates\n\n### Factors Influencing Success of Human Hunters\n\nSeveral factors can influence a human hunter's success, including:\n\n* Experience and skill: hunters who have experience and skill tend to have higher hunting success rates\n* Equipment: hunters who use advanced equipment, such as binoculars or rifles, tend to have higher hunting success rates\n* Prey population: hunters who hunt in areas with high prey populations tend to have higher hunting success rates\n* Human disturbance: hunters who hunt in areas with minimal human disturbance tend to have higher hunting success rates\n\n### Hunting Types and Methods\n\nHuman hunters employ various hunting types and methods, including:\n\n* Big game hunting: hunting large animals such as deer, elk, or moose\n* Small game hunting: hunting smaller animals such as rabbits, squirrels, or birds\n* Furbearing hunting: hunting animals for their fur, such as beavers or raccoons\n* Waterfowl hunting: hunting ducks, geese, or other waterfowl\n\n### Impact\n\nHunting success can have significant impacts on animal populations, ecosystems, and human communities.\n\n* Overhunting can lead to declines in animal populations and ecosystem disruption\n* Successful hunting can provide food and income for human communities\n* Hunting regulations and management can help maintain healthy animal populations and ecosystems\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Hunting\n* Wildlife management\n* Conservation biology\n* Animal behavior\n* Human ecology", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

Along the way, Miles learns more about his own powers and the responsibility that comes with being a Spider-Man.

The strike, led by the Writers Guild of America (WGA), was a labor dispute between the WGA and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), which represents the major studios and producers.\n\n**Issues in the strike**\n\nThe strike was sparked by a number of issues, including:\n\n* Residuals: The WGA was seeking increased residuals for writers, particularly in the realm of streaming services, which they argued were not fairly compensating writers for their work.\n* Script fees: The WGA was seeking higher script fees for writers, which they argued were not keeping pace with inflation.\n* Studio profitability: The WGA was concerned that the studios were prioritizing profits over writers' fair compensation and working conditions.\n* Diversity and inclusion: The WGA was seeking more diverse and inclusive hiring practices, as well as more opportunities for writers from underrepresented communities.\n\n**Timeline of negotiations and strike activity**\n\n### April 2023\n\nIn April 2023, the WGA and AMPTP began negotiating a new contract. The WGA presented a comprehensive proposal that addressed many of the issues mentioned above. However, the AMPTP rejected the proposal, citing concerns about the impact on studio profitability.\n\n### May 2023\n\nOn May 2, 2023, the WGA announced that it would be going on strike, effective immediately. The strike began with a picket line outside the Writers Guild of America headquarters in Los Angeles.\n\n### June 2023\n\nIn June 2023, the WGA and AMPTP continued to negotiate, but no agreement was reached. The strike continued, with many writers and industry professionals participating in pickets and rallies.\n\n### July 2023\n\nIn July 2023, the WGA announced that it would be expanding its strike to include writers working in the streaming services sector. This move was seen as a major escalation of the strike, and it sparked a significant backlash from the studios and producers.\n\n### August 2023\n\nIn August 2023, the WGA and AMPTP resumed negotiations in an effort to reach a deal. However, the talks broke down, and the strike continued.\n\n### September 2023\n\nIn September 2023, the WGA announced that it would be holding a national day of action, with writers and industry professionals participating in pickets and rallies across the country.\n\n### October 2023\n\nIn October 2023, the WGA and AMPTP announced that they had reached a tentative agreement. The deal addressed many of the issues mentioned above, including residuals, script fees, and diversity and inclusion.\n\n**WGA negotiating committee**\n\nThe WGA negotiating committee was led by the WGA president, Meredith Stiehm. The committee consisted of a group of experienced writers and industry professionals who worked together to negotiate the new contract.\n\n**Productions impacted**\n\nThe strike impacted a number of productions, including:\n\n* The TV show \"The Last of Us,\" which was forced to shut down production\n* The film \"Oppenheimer,\" which was delayed due to the strike\n* The TV show \"The Mandalorian,\" which was forced to pause production\n\n**Response**\n\n### Actors during the WGA strike\n\nMany actors, including those from the Screen Actors Guild (SAG-AFTRA), expressed their support for the WGA strike. Some actors even participated in pickets and rallies alongside the WGA.\n\n### Elected officials\n\nElected officials, including Senator Bernie Sanders and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, expressed their support for the WGA strike. They argued that the strike was a fight for fair compensation and working conditions.\n\n### Other unions\n\nOther unions, including the Directors Guild of America (DGA) and the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE), expressed their support for the WGA strike. They argued that the strike was a fight for fair compensation and working conditions for all industry professionals.\n\n### Foreign unions\n\nForeign unions, including the British Actors' Equity Association and the Canadian Actors' Equity Association, expressed their support for the WGA strike. They argued that the strike was a fight for fair compensation and working conditions for all industry professionals.\n\n### Film and television executives\n\nFilm and television executives, including those from the major studios and producers, expressed their opposition to the WGA strike. They argued that the strike would have a negative impact on the industry and that it was not justified.\n\n### Strikebreaking efforts\n\nSome executives and producers attempted to break the strike by hiring non-WGA writers to work on their productions.

The tournament was organized by the Badminton World Federation (BWF) and was part of the BWF World Tour Super 500 series.\n\n**Tournament**\n\nThe 2022 Indonesia Masters was the 14th edition of the Indonesia Masters tournament, which was first held in 2007. The tournament was played at the GOR Wiwaha Wisata Stadium in Surabaya, Indonesia. The tournament featured a total of 16 men's singles players, 16 women's singles players, 16 men's doubles pairs, 16 women's doubles pairs, and 16 mixed doubles pairs competing in the main draw.\n\n**Venue**\n\nThe 2022 Indonesia Masters was held at the GOR Wiwaha Wisata Stadium in Surabaya, Indonesia. The stadium has a seating capacity of 8,000 spectators and is equipped with modern facilities, including a main court, a practice court, and a media center. The stadium is also equipped with a state-of-the-art lighting system, which allows for day and night matches to be played.\n\n**Point distribution**\n\nThe 2022 Indonesia Masters used the BWF's new point distribution system, which was introduced in 2021. The point distribution system rewards players for winning each game, with the winner of each game earning 1 point and the loser earning 0 points. The winner of the match earns 1 point for each game won, with a maximum of 21 points possible. The player or pair with the most points at the end of the match wins.\n\n**Prize pool**\n\nThe 2022 Indonesia Masters had a total prize pool of $400,000, which was distributed among the winners and runners-up in each event. The winner of each event earned $45,000, while the runner-up earned $22,500.\n\n**Controversy**\n\nThe 2022 Indonesia Masters was marred by controversy when the Indonesian badminton association announced that they would be implementing a new rule that would require all players to wear traditional Indonesian attire during the tournament.

It is located on the northwestern shore of Lake Calhoun, near the Mississippi River. The city is known for its vibrant arts and culture scene, as well as its thriving economy and diverse neighborhoods.\n\n**History**\n-----------\n\n### Dakota Homeland\n\nFor thousands of years, the area that is now Minneapolis was home to the Dakota people, who called it Bdeidákta, meaning \"muddy water.\" The Dakota tribe was forcibly removed from the area in the 1860s, and the city was founded in 1867 by a group of settlers who were attracted by the area's natural resources and favorable climate.\n\n### Industries Develop\n\nIn the late 19th century, Minneapolis became a major center for the flour milling industry, with the Pillsbury and Washburn companies building large mills along the Mississippi River.

The city's economy grew rapidly, and by the early 20th century, Minneapolis was one of the wealthiest cities in the United States.\n\n### Social Tensions\n\nHowever, the city's economic success was not shared equally by all residents. The city's African American community, which had grown significantly during World War II, faced segregation and discrimination in housing, education, and employment.

The city's housing market, for example, is heavily segregated, with many neighborhoods being predominantly white or minority.\n\n### Religion\n\nMinneapolis has a diverse range of religious communities, including Christian, Jewish, Muslim, and Buddhist congregations.

The incursions were carried out by pro-Ukrainian forces, who infiltrated Russian territory and clashed with Russian government forces.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Belgorod Oblast is a region located in western Russia, bordering Ukraine. The region has been affected by the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, with periodic skirmishes and incursions taking place along the border. In the months leading up to the incursions, tensions had increased, with reports of Ukrainian military activity in the region and alleged Russian troop deployments along the border.\n\n**First Raid**\n\nThe first raid took place on **22 May 2023**, when a group of pro-Ukrainian forces infiltrated the village of Krasny Yar, located in the Belgorod Oblast. The forces, reportedly consisting of Ukrainian militiamen and local residents, began to destroy Russian military equipment and infrastructure in the village. Russian government forces responded quickly, deploying troops and airpower to the area. The resulting clashes resulted in the deaths of several Russian soldiers and the destruction of significant amounts of military equipment.\n\n**23 May**\n\nOn **23 May 2023**, the second day of the raid, pro-Ukrainian forces expanded their operations to the village of Shebekino, located approximately 10 kilometers east of Krasny Yar. The forces, again reportedly consisting of Ukrainian militiamen and local residents, began to destroy Russian military equipment and infrastructure in the village. Russian government forces responded with air strikes and artillery fire, resulting in significant damage to the village and the surrounding area.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe first raid resulted in the deaths of several Russian soldiers and the destruction of significant amounts of military equipment. The Russian government responded by deploying additional troops and airpower to the region, and by imposing a state of emergency in the Belgorod Oblast. The Russian government also accused Ukraine of responsibility for the incursions, and threatened to take \"retaliatory measures\" against Ukraine.\n\n**Second Raid**\n\nThe second raid took place on **1–3 June 2023**, when a group of pro-Ukrainian forces infiltrated the village of Boroml, located in the Belgorod Oblast. The forces, reportedly consisting of Ukrainian militiamen and local residents, began to destroy Russian military equipment and infrastructure in the village. Russian government forces responded quickly, deploying troops and airpower to the area.

The tournament took place from August 9 to August 20, 2022, in Edmonton and Red Deer, Alberta, Canada.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe tournament was originally scheduled to take place in August 2021, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was postponed to 2022. The tournament was initially scheduled to be held in Edmonton, Alberta, and Red Deer, Alberta, but was later moved to the United States and Sweden. However, due to travel restrictions and quarantine requirements, the tournament was eventually moved back to its original host cities in Canada.\n\n**Preparations**\n\nPreparations for the tournament began in 2021, with the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) working closely with the Canadian Ice Hockey Association to finalize the details of the tournament. The IIHF also announced that the tournament would be held in a bubble format, with all teams and officials quarantining together in a secure environment to minimize the risk of COVID-19 transmission.\n\n**Cancellation and rescheduling of tournament due to COVID-19**\n\nIn March 2021, the IIHF announced that the tournament would be postponed to 2022 due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The decision was made in consultation with the Canadian government and health authorities, who were concerned about the potential risks of hosting an international tournament during a pandemic. The IIHF also announced that the tournament would be held in a bubble format, with all teams and officials quarantining together in a secure environment.\n\n**Sponsorship withdrawals and low attendance**\n\nIn July 2021, several major sponsors of the tournament announced that they would be withdrawing their support due to the ongoing pandemic.

This chronology provides a detailed account of the major events and milestones of this period.\n\n# Chronologies of the Crusades in Print\n\nThere are several notable chronologies of the Crusades that have been written by historians and scholars over the centuries. These works provide valuable insights into the events of the time and have been instrumental in shaping our understanding of the Crusades. Some of the most notable chronologies include those written by Matthew Paris, William of Tyre, and James of Voragine.\n\n# 13th century\n\n## Prior Events\n\nThe Later Crusades were preceded by a series of events that set the stage for the Fourth Crusade. In 1198, Pope Innocent III called for a new crusade, which would eventually become the Fourth Crusade. The Fourth Crusade was initially aimed at recapturing Jerusalem from the Muslim forces, but it was diverted to Constantinople, where the Crusaders sacked the city in 1204.\n\n## 1270\n\nIn 1270, King Louis IX of France launched a new crusade, which was aimed at recapturing Tunis from the Muslim forces. However, the crusade was ultimately unsuccessful, and King Louis IX died in 1270.\n\n## 1280\n\nIn 1280, the Mamluk Sultanate, which was a powerful Muslim dynasty in Egypt, launched a series of attacks on the Crusader states in Palestine. The Mamluks were able to capture several key cities, including Acre and Haifa.\n\n## 1290\n\nIn 1290, King Edward I of England launched a new crusade, which was aimed at recapturing Jerusalem from the Muslim forces. However, the crusade was ultimately unsuccessful, and King Edward I was forced to negotiate a treaty with the Mamluk Sultanate.\n\n# 14th century\n\n## 1300\n\nIn 1300, the Ottoman Empire, which was a powerful Muslim state in Anatolia, began to expand its territories. The Ottomans would eventually become a major player in the Later Crusades, and would play a key role in the fall of the Byzantine Empire.\n\n## 1310\n\nIn 1310, the Mamluk Sultanate launched a series of attacks on the Crusader states in Syria. The Mamluks were able to capture several key cities, including Sidon and Beirut.\n\n## 1320\n\nIn 1320, the Ottoman Empire launched a series of attacks on the Byzantine Empire. The Ottomans were able to capture several key cities, including Bursa and Prusa.\n\n## 1330\n\nIn 1330, the Ottoman Empire launched a series of attacks on the Crusader states in Greece. The Ottomans were able to capture several key cities, including Thessaloniki and Patras.\n\n## 1340\n\nIn 1340, the Black Death, a pandemic that would eventually kill millions of people, began to spread across Europe. The Black Death would have a devastating impact on the Later Crusades, as many of its leaders and soldiers were killed by the disease.\n\n## 1350\n\nIn 1350, the Ottoman Empire launched a series of attacks on the Byzantine Empire. The Ottomans were able to capture several key cities, including Nicaea and Nicomedia.\n\n## 1360\n\nIn 1360, the Ottoman Empire launched a series of attacks on the Crusader states in Greece. The Ottomans were able to capture several key cities, including Corinth and Athens.\n\n## 1370\n\nIn 1370, the Ottoman Empire launched a series of attacks on the Crusader states in Asia Minor. The Ottomans were able to capture several key cities, including Smyrna and Perga.\n\n## 1380\n\nIn 1380, the Ottoman Empire launched a series of attacks on the Byzantine Empire. The Ottomans were able to capture several key cities, including Adrianople and Gallipoli.\n\n## 1390\n\nIn 1390, the Ottoman Empire launched a series of attacks on the Crusader states in the Balkans. The Ottomans were able to capture several key cities, including Sofia and Nis.\n\n# 15th century\n\n## 1400\n\nIn 1400, the Ottoman Empire launched a series of attacks on the Byzantine Empire. The Ottomans were able to capture several key cities, including Thessaloniki and Serres. The Ottoman Empire would eventually capture Constantinople in 1453, marking the end of the Byzantine Empire.\n\nThe Later Crusades were a complex and multifaceted period in history, marked by numerous military campaigns, political intrigue, and cultural exchange.
