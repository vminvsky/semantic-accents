Rodrigo worked with producers Dan Nigro, Jack Antonoff, and Taylor Swift's collaborator, Aaron Dessner, among others. The album's lyrics were influenced by Rodrigo's experiences with love, heartbreak, and self-discovery. The recording process took place at various studios, including Nigro's home studio in Los Angeles and Dessner's studio in New York.\n\n## Lyrics\n\nThe lyrics of Guts explore themes of love, relationships, and personal growth. Rodrigo's songwriting is characterized by her introspective and emotionally honest approach. The album's lyrics are often abstract and open to interpretation, allowing listeners to connect with the music on a personal level. The album's opening track, \"Drivers License,\" features lyrics that explore the pain of a past relationship. Other tracks, such as \"Vampire\" and \"Traitor,\" delve into themes of heartbreak and betrayal.\n\n# Release and promotion\n\nGuts was released on May 5, 2023, to widespread critical acclaim.

The song's music video, directed by Rodrigo and Christian Breslauer, features the singer-songwriter driving through Los Angeles while reflecting on a past relationship.\n\n## Cover artwork\n\nThe cover artwork for Guts features Rodrigo standing in a dimly lit room, surrounded by candles and flowers. The image is a nod to the album's themes of love, heartbreak, and self-discovery. The artwork was created by Rodrigo and photographer Christian Breslauer.\n\n## Singles\n\nIn addition to \"Drivers License,\" Guts features several other singles, including \"Vampire,\" \"Traitor,\" and \"Fool.\" These tracks have been well-received by fans and critics alike, with many praising Rodrigo's vocal abilities and songwriting skills.\n\n## Marketing\n\nTo promote Guts, Rodrigo embarked on a world tour, which kicked off in May 2023. The tour features a mix of new and older material, with Rodrigo performing tracks from both Sour and Guts. Rodrigo has also been promoting the album through social media, sharing behind-the-scenes glimpses of the recording process and behind-the-scenes footage from the music video shoot.\n\n## Tour\n\nThe Guts Tour kicked off on May 10, 2023, in Los Angeles and will run until the end of the year. The tour will feature a mix of new and older material, with Rodrigo performing tracks from both Sour and Guts. Rodrigo has been praised for her high-energy live performances, which often feature elaborate staging and visual effects.\n\n## Guts: The Secret Tracks\n\nIn addition to the standard Guts album, Olivia Rodrigo has released a series of secret tracks, which are available exclusively on streaming platforms. These tracks offer a glimpse into Rodrigo's creative process and feature songs that didn't make the final cut for the standard album.\n\n# Critical reception\n\nGuts received widespread critical acclaim upon its release. Critics praised Rodrigo's songwriting and vocal abilities, as well as the album's experimental and mature sound. Many reviewers noted that the album marked a new era in Rodrigo's music career, showcasing her growth and development as a singer-songwriter.\n\n## Year-end lists\n\nGuts appeared on several year-end lists, including Rolling Stone's 50 Best Albums of 2023 and NME's 50 Best Albums of 2023.

Union of India\n\nThe Supriyo v. Union of India case is a landmark Indian Supreme Court decision that ruled on the validity of same-sex marriage and the rights of sexual and gender minority individuals. The case was filed by a same-sex couple, seeking recognition of their marriage and protection from social exclusion and violence.\n\nIntroduction\n----------\n\nThe case of Supriyo v. Union of India highlights the complexities of social and cultural norms in India, particularly with regards to same-sex relationships and marriage. The Indian Supreme Court's decision in this case has significant implications for the rights of sexual and gender minority individuals, as well as the country's approach to marriage and family law.\n\nCase Summary\n------------\n\n### Intervenors\n\n#### Government\n\nThe Indian government was a respondent in the case, arguing that the recognition of same-sex marriage would undermine traditional Indian values and social norms.\n\n#### Religious organisation\n\nSeveral religious organizations, including the Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind and the Telangana Markazi Shia Ulema Council, intervened in the case, arguing that same-sex marriage was contrary to Islamic and Hindu teachings.\n\nBackground\n----------\n\nThe background of the case is rooted in India's complex history of social and cultural norms. The Indian Penal Code (IPC) criminalizes same-sex relationships, and the country's marriage laws are based on the Hindu Marriage Act, which defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman. This has led to social exclusion and violence against sexual and gender minority individuals.\n\nWritten Arguments\n-----------------\n\n### Petitioners\n\nThe petitioners, a same-sex couple, argued that the IPC and the Hindu Marriage Act violate their fundamental rights, including the right to equality, freedom of expression, and the right to marry.\n\n#### Fundamental rights\n\nThe petitioners argued that the Indian Constitution guarantees the right to equality (Article 14), freedom of expression (Article 19), and the right to marry (Article 21). They also argued that the IPC and the Hindu Marriage Act discriminate against them on the basis of their sexual orientation.\n\n#### Jurisdiction\n\nThe petitioners argued that the Indian Supreme Court has jurisdiction to hear the case, as the IPC and the Hindu Marriage Act are federal laws.\n\n#### Constitutional morality\n\nThe petitioners argued that the Indian Constitution is based on the principles of equality and justice, and that the recognition of same-sex marriage is consistent with these principles.\n\n#### Right to equality\n\nThe petitioners argued that the IPC and the Hindu Marriage Act do not provide equal rights to sexual and gender minority individuals, and that this violates their right to equality.\n\n#### Anti-discrimination\n\nThe petitioners argued that the IPC and the Hindu Marriage Act discriminate against them on the basis of their sexual orientation, and that this is a form of anti-discrimination.\n\n#### Freedom of expression\n\nThe petitioners argued that the IPC and the Hindu Marriage Act restrict their freedom of expression, as they are criminalized for their sexual orientation.\n\n#### Right to life and personal liberty\n\nThe petitioners argued that the IPC and the Hindu Marriage Act restrict their right to life and personal liberty, as they are subject to social exclusion and violence.\n\n#### Freedom of conscience and religion\n\nThe petitioners argued that the IPC and the Hindu Marriage Act do not provide them with the freedom to practice their religion or conscience.\n\n#### Right to marry\n\nThe petitioners argued that the IPC and the Hindu Marriage Act do not provide them with the right to marry, and that this is a fundamental right.\n\n### Issues in secular marriage law\n\n#### Non-equality\n\nThe petitioners argued that the IPC and the Hindu Marriage Act do not provide equal rights to sexual and gender minority individuals, and that this violates their right to equality.\n\n#### Violations of freedom of expression\n\nThe petitioners argued that the IPC and the Hindu Marriage Act restrict their freedom of expression, as they are criminalized for their sexual orientation.\n\n#### Violations of decisional autonomy\n\nThe petitioners argued that the IPC and the Hindu Marriage Act do not provide them with the autonomy to make decisions about their own lives and relationships.\n\n### Representative and heirs\n\nThe petitioners argued that they have the right to represent themselves and to be recognized as heirs to their partner's estate.\n\n### International treaties\n\nThe petitioners argued that India is a signatory to several international treaties that guarantee the rights of sexual and gender minority individuals, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n\n### Soft Law\n\nThe petitioners argued that India has ratified several soft law documents that guarantee the rights of sexual and gender minority individuals, including the Yogyakarta Principles.\n\n### Obergefell v.

individuals.\n\n#### Health disparity\n\nThe petitioners argued that the health disparity between sexual and gender minority individuals and the general population is significant.\n\n##

This article explores Martin's early life, his rise to fame as a performing orangutan, and his later years as a beloved fixture in various circuses and zoos.\n\n**Background**\n\nOrangutans are native to the tropical forests of Indonesia and Malaysia, and are known for their intelligence, agility, and distinctive appearance. As the most intelligent of the great apes, orangutans have been observed using tools, learning sign language, and displaying complex social behaviors. In the early 20th century, orangutans were a rare and exotic sight in the United States, and their presence in the entertainment industry was often used to captivate audiences with their unique abilities and charisma.\n\n**Biography**\n\n### Transoceanic shipment and first owners\n\nJoe Martin's origins are shrouded in mystery, but it is believed that he was born in the Indonesian jungle and was later captured and shipped to the United States. Martin's first owners are not well-documented, but it is known that he was purchased by a traveling circus in the early 1910s. As a young orangutan, Martin quickly adapted to his new environment and began to learn tricks and behaviors that would make him a star in the entertainment industry.\n\n### 1915–1917: Breakout film and early work\n\nIn 1915, Martin made his film debut in a silent movie called \"The Orangutan,\" which was produced by the Mutual Film Corporation. The film was a commercial success, and Martin's performances in the movie helped to establish him as a popular attraction in the American entertainment industry. Over the next few years, Martin appeared in several more films, including \"The Jungle\" and \"The Wild Beast.\" During this time, he also began to tour with a circus, performing acrobatic stunts and tricks for audiences across the country.\n\n### 1918: Influenza epidemic, and night-watchman incident\n\nIn 1918, Martin was forced to take a break from performing due to the influenza epidemic that swept the United States. During this time, he was cared for by his owners, who were struggling to keep him healthy and happy. In one notable incident, Martin broke out of his enclosure at night, causing quite a commotion among the circus staff. The incident was eventually resolved, and Martin was safely returned to his quarters.\n\n### 1919: Escapes and Al Santell incident\n\nIn 1919, Martin escaped from his enclosure on two separate occasions, causing concern among his owners and the circus staff. In one of these incidents, Martin was spotted by a trapeze artist named Al Santell, who was performing a aerial stunt at the time. Martin was fascinated by Santell's performance and attempted to imitate his movements, causing quite a commotion among the audience.\n\n### 1920: Tarzan incident\n\nIn 1920, Martin was involved in a notable incident with a young man named Tarzan, who was a member of the circus staff. Tarzan was performing a Tarzan-like stunt, swinging from a rope and leaping across the stage. Martin, who was fascinated by Tarzan's performance, attempted to imitate him, causing a chaotic scene among the audience.\n\n### 1921: Continuing in show business, Ethel Stecker incident\n\nIn 1921, Martin continued to tour with a circus, performing acrobatic stunts and tricks for audiences across the country. During this time, he was involved in a notable incident with a young woman named Ethel Stecker, who was a member of the circus staff. Stecker was performing a trapeze act, and Martin, who was watching from the audience, became fascinated by her movements and attempted to imitate her, causing quite a commotion among the audience.\n\n### 1922–1923: Behavioral issues, death of Curley Stecker\n\nIn 1922 and 1923, Martin began to exhibit behavioral issues, including becoming aggressive and destructive towards his owners and the circus staff. During this time, the circus was forced to take a break from touring, and Martin was cared for by a team of animal handlers. Unfortunately, Martin's behavior continued to deteriorate, and in 1923, his owner, Curley Stecker, died suddenly. Martin was devastated by Stecker's death and continued to exhibit behavioral issues, causing concern among the circus staff.\n\n### 1923–1927: Barnes Circus and Barnes City Zoo\n\nIn 1923, Martin was purchased by Barnes Circus, a traveling circus that was based in the United States. Under the care of the circus staff, Martin began to settle down and exhibit fewer behavioral issues. In 1927, the circus was forced to close due to financial difficulties, and Martin was relocated to the Barnes City Zoo, where he remained until his death.\n\n### 1928–1931: Last reports\n\nThe last reported sightings of Martin were in 1928 and 1931, when he was seen at the Barnes City Zoo. At the time, Martin was described as an elderly orangutan, who was struggling with health issues and was in need of regular care and attention. Unfortunately, Martin's ultimate fate remains unknown, and it is possible that he may have died in captivity.\n\n**Filmography**\n\nWhile Martin's film career was relatively short-lived, he appeared in several notable films, including:\n\n* \"The Orangutan\" (1915)\n* \"The Jungle\" (1916)\n* \"The Wild Beast\" (1917)\n\n**Gallery**\n\n* A photograph of Martin in his prime, taken in the early 1910s.\n* A sketch of Martin performing a trapeze stunt, taken in the early 1920s.\n* A photograph of Martin with his owner, Curley Stecker, taken in the early 1920s.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Orangutans in captivity\n* Performing animals in the entertainment industry\n* Early 20th century American entertainment industry\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is based on available information and may not be comprehensive.\n* The life and career of Joe Martin are well-documented, but some details remain unclear.\n* Additional research is needed to provide a more complete understanding of Martin's life and career.\n\n**References**\n\n* (none)\n\n**Further reading**\n\n* \"The Orangutan\" by D.H.

His name, Merenre, means \"he who belongs to the god Re\", and Nemtyemsaf is interpreted as \"the son of Nemty\". He is believed to have reigned for approximately 5-6 years, although the exact duration of his rule is still a matter of debate among historians.\n\n**Family**\n\n### Parents and Siblings\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's parentage is not well documented in ancient sources. However, it is believed that he was a member of the royal family, possibly a descendant of the 5th dynasty pharaohs. His relationship to his predecessor and successor is also unclear, although some historians suggest that he may have been a co-regent with his predecessor.\n\n### Consorts and Children\n\nUnfortunately, there is little information available about Merenre Nemtyemsaf I's personal life. His consort and children are unknown, and it is unclear whether he had any children who survived him. It is possible that he may have had a wife or wives, but their names and identities have not been recorded in ancient sources.\n\n**Reign**\n\n### Attestations\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's reign is attested in several ancient sources, including the Turin Papyrus, the Saqqara King List, and the Abydos King List. These sources provide limited information about his reign, but they do confirm his existence and his position as a pharaoh of the 7th dynasty.\n\n### Chronology\n\n#### Relative\n\nThe chronology of Merenre Nemtyemsaf I's reign is relative, meaning that it is based on the relationships between different pharaohs. According to the Turin Papyrus, he reigned after his predecessor, who is believed to have been Neferkare II. However, the exact relationship between these two pharaohs is unclear, and some historians have suggested that they may have been co-regents.\n\n#### Absolute\n\nThe absolute chronology of Merenre Nemtyemsaf I's reign is more difficult to establish. Scholars have used various methods to estimate the dates of his reign, including the study of astronomical events and the analysis of architectural styles. Based on these studies, it is estimated that Merenre Nemtyemsaf I ruled for approximately 5-6 years, although this date is still a matter of debate.\n\n### Duration\n\nThe duration of Merenre Nemtyemsaf I's reign is estimated to be around 5-6 years. This is based on the analysis of the Turin Papyrus and other ancient sources, which provide limited information about his reign. However, some historians have suggested that he may have ruled for a shorter or longer period of time.\n\n### Accession to the Throne: Co-Regency\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's accession to the throne is unclear, although some historians have suggested that he may have been a co-regent with his predecessor. Co-regency was a common practice in ancient Egypt, where a pharaoh would share power with a co-regent, often a family member or a trusted advisor.\n\n### Domestic Activities\n\n#### Administration\n\nAs the pharaoh of the 7th dynasty, Merenre Nemtyemsaf I was responsible for the administration of the kingdom. This included the management of the economy, the collection of taxes, and the maintenance of law and order. Unfortunately, there is little information available about his administrative activities, although it is likely that he followed the same practices as his predecessors.\n\n#### Cultic Activities\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's cultic activities are also unclear, although it is likely that he participated in traditional Egyptian cultic practices. As the pharaoh, he would have been responsible for maintaining the temples and the cults of the gods, and for ensuring the continued worship of the ancient deities.\n\n#### Construction Works\n\nThere is limited information available about Merenre Nemtyemsaf I's construction activities, although it is likely that he undertook various building projects during his reign. As the pharaoh, he would have been responsible for maintaining and expanding the kingdom's infrastructure, including its temples, tombs, and other architectural structures.\n\n### End of Reign\n\nThe end of Merenre Nemtyemsaf I's reign is unclear, although it is believed that he may have been succeeded by a co-regent or a member of his family. Unfortunately, there is little information available about his successor or the events that followed his reign.\n\n**Foreign Activities**\n\n### Eastern Desert and Levant\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's foreign activities are limited in ancient sources, although it is likely that he maintained relations with neighboring kingdoms and trading partners. The Eastern Desert and the Levant were important regions for ancient Egypt, and it is possible that Merenre Nemtyemsaf I may have undertaken trade missions or military campaigns in these areas.\n\n### Nubia\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's relations with Nubia are unclear, although it is possible that he maintained diplomatic or trade relations with the Nubian kingdoms. Nubia was an important region for ancient Egypt, and it is likely that Merenre Nemtyemsaf I would have been interested in maintaining good relations with the Nubian kingdoms.\n\n**Pyramid Complex**\n\n### Main Pyramid\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's pyramid complex is located in Saqqara, and it is believed to be a small, stepped pyramid. Unfortunately, there is limited information available about the pyramid's construction or its original appearance.\n\n### Mortuary Temple\n\nThe mortuary temple of Merenre Nemtyemsaf I is also located in Saqqara, and it is believed to be a small, simple structure. Unfortunately, there is limited information available about its construction or its original appearance.\n\n### Mummy\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's mummy has not been discovered, although it is possible that it may be located in a tomb or a cache in Saqqara.\n\n**Legacy**\n\n### Old Kingdom\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's legacy is unclear, although it is likely that he was remembered as a pharaoh of the 7th dynasty. The Old Kingdom was a period of significant cultural and architectural achievement in ancient Egypt, and it is possible that Merenre Nemtyemsaf I's reign contributed to this legacy.\n\n### Later Periods\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's legacy in later periods is unclear, although it is possible that he may have been remembered as a pharaoh of the 7th dynasty. Unfortunately, there is limited information available about his impact on later periods of ancient Egyptian history.\n\n**Notes**\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's reign is a topic of ongoing debate among historians and Egyptologists. While there is limited information available about his life and reign, it is clear that he was a pharaoh of the 7th dynasty, who ruled during the First Intermediate Period. Further research is needed to fully understand his reign and its impact on ancient Egyptian history.\n\n**References**\n\nUnfortunately, there are no references available for this article, as the information is based on general knowledge and historical research.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

Based on the classic fairy tale by Charles Perrault, the film features the voice talents of Mary Costa as Princess Aurora and Bill Shirley as Prince Philip. The film's storyline follows the events leading up to the princess's 16th birthday, when she is placed under a sleeping curse by the evil fairy Maleficent.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film begins with the presentation of Princess Aurora, the beautiful daughter of King Stefan and Queen Leah, to the three good fairies, Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather, who have been tasked with watching over her. However, the evil fairy Maleficent, who was not invited to the presentation, curses the princess to prick her finger on a spinning wheel and die on her 16th birthday. The good fairies attempt to counter the curse, but only manage to weaken it, resulting in the princess falling into a deep sleep instead of dying.\n\nAs the princess's 16th birthday approaches, the good fairies and King Stefan attempt to keep her away from spinning wheels, but she eventually stumbles upon one in the forest and pricks her finger, falling into a deep sleep. The entire kingdom is placed under a sleeping curse, with everyone except the good fairies and Maleficent falling into a deep slumber.\n\nThe film follows the story of Prince Philip, who sets out to find the sleeping princess and break the curse. Along the way, he encounters various obstacles, including Maleficent's minions and the forest's dangers. Eventually, he reaches the castle and finds the princess, but Maleficent appears and attempts to kill him. However, the good fairies and other animals band together to defeat Maleficent, and the curse is broken, allowing the princess to awaken.\n\n**Voice cast**\n\n* Mary Costa as Princess Aurora\n* Bill Shirley as Prince Philip\n* Eleanor Audley as Maleficent\n* Verna Felton as Flora\n* Barbara Luderowski as Fauna\n* Barbara Jo Allen as Merryweather\n* Taylor Holmes as King Stefan\n* Bill Thompson as King Hubert\n* Bill Lee as Spinning Wheel Narrator\n* Thurl Ravenscroft as Maleficent's Minion (uncredited)\n\n**Production**\n\n### Story development\n\nThe idea for Sleeping Beauty was first conceived by Walt Disney in 1939, but it was not until 1949 that the story was officially greenlit. The film's storyline was developed by a team of writers, including Erdman Penner, Winston Hibler, Joe Rinaldi, and Bill Walsh.\n\n### Casting\n\nMary Costa was cast as the voice of Princess Aurora after a nationwide search for the perfect voice. Costa was a relatively unknown singer and actress at the time, but her voice was deemed perfect for the role. Bill Shirley was cast as Prince Philip, and Eleanor Audley was cast as Maleficent.\n\n### Production delays\n\nThe production of Sleeping Beauty was delayed due to various reasons, including the development of the story, the construction of the animation studio, and the casting of the voice actors. The film was initially scheduled for release in 1955, but it was eventually pushed back to 1959.\n\n### Animation\n\n#### Art direction\n\nThe animation for Sleeping Beauty was done in a style that was reminiscent of the classic fairy tale illustrations of Arthur Rackham. The film's art director, Ken Anderson, worked closely with the animators to create a cohesive and immersive world.\n\n#### Live-action reference\n\nThe film's animation was influenced by live-action reference, with the animators using photographs and films of real-world locations and characters to inspire their work. The film's iconic ballroom scene, for example, was inspired by a real-life ballroom that was photographed by the film's animators.\n\n#### Character animation\n\nThe character animation for Sleeping Beauty was done by a team of skilled animators, including Frank Thomas, Ollie Johnston, and Marc Davis. The animators used a range of techniques, including keyframe animation and squash and stretch, to bring the characters to life.\n\n### Music\n\nThe music for Sleeping Beauty was composed by George Bruns, with lyrics by the Sherman Brothers. The film's soundtrack features a range of memorable songs, including \"Once Upon a Dream\" and \"Sleeping Beauty Waltz\".\n\n**Release**\n\n### Original theatrical run\n\nSleeping Beauty was released on January 29, 1959, at the Carthay Circle Theatre in Los Angeles. The film was released in both 70mm and 35mm formats, and it was a major commercial success, grossing over $218 million worldwide.\n\n### Re-releases\n\nSleeping Beauty has been re-released several times over the years, including in 1964, 1970, and 1975. The film has also been released on home video and DVD.\n\n### Home media\n\nSleeping Beauty was first released on home video in 1986, and it has since been released on a range of formats, including VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray. In 2011, Disney released a special edition of the film on Blu-ray, which featured a range of bonus features and deleted scenes.\n\n#### Lawsuit\n\nIn 2011, Disney was sued by a group of investors who claimed that the company had not paid them the profits from the film's re-releases. The lawsuit was eventually settled out of court.\n\n**Reception**\n\n### Critical response\n\nSleeping Beauty received widespread critical acclaim upon its release, with many praising the film's animation, music, and storyline. The film holds a 98% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with many critics praising its beauty and charm.\n\n### Accolades\n\nSleeping Beauty won several awards upon its release, including the 1959 Academy Award for Best Original Score and the 1959 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score. The film was also nominated for several other awards, including the 1959 BAFTA Award for Best Foreign Film.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nSleeping Beauty has had a lasting impact on popular culture, with its imagery and music being referenced and parodied in countless films, TV shows, and other works of art. The film's iconic ballroom scene, for example, has been parodied in everything from The Simpsons to Monty Python.\n\nThe film's influence can also be seen in the work of other animators and filmmakers, who have been inspired by its beauty and charm. The film's animation style, for example, has been cited as an influence by animators such as Hayao Miyazaki and Brad Bird.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)\n* Walt Disney Productions\n* Mary Costa\n* Bill Shirley\n* Eleanor Audley\n* Verna Felton\n* Barbara Luderowski\n* Barbara Jo Allen\n* Taylor Holmes\n* Bill Thompson\n* Bill Lee\n* Thurl Ravenscroft\n* George Bruns\n* The Sherman Brothers\n\n**Notes**\n\n* Sleeping Beauty was the first Disney film to be released in 70mm format.\n* The film's soundtrack was the first Disney soundtrack to be released on LP.\n* The film's iconic ballroom scene was filmed in a real-life ballroom that was rented for the purpose of the film.\n* The film's animation was influenced by the work of Arthur Rackham, a British illustrator who was known for his fairy tale illustrations.\n* The film's storyline was developed by a team of writers who were inspired by the classic fairy tale by Charles Perrault.\n\n**References**\n\n* This article is based on the 1959 film Sleeping Beauty.\n* The film's production notes and behind-the-scenes materials are housed at the Walt Disney Archives.\n* The film's soundtrack was released on LP in 1959 and has since been re-released on CD and digital formats.\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n* The Disney Archives: A History of the Disney Animation Studio, 1932-1961 by John Hench\n* Walt Disney's Storybook: A Photographic History of the Disney Studio by Walt Disney\n* The Art of Walt Disney by Christopher Finch\n* The Disney Film Encyclopedia by Frank Miller\n* The Walt Disney Story by Herbert L.

The incident has become one of the most enduring and intriguing UFO stories of the 20th century, with various conspiracy theories and explanations emerging over the years.\n\n**1947 Military Balloon Crash**\n\nOn July 2, 1947, a strange object was discovered on a ranch near Roswell by a local farmer, W.W. Brazel. The object was described as a large, metallic debris field, and Brazel reported it to the local sheriff, George Wilcox. The sheriff in turn notified the local Air Force Base, Roswell Army Air Field (RAAF), and a team was dispatched to investigate the site.\n\nThe team, led by Major Jesse Marcel, found a large amount of debris, including metal fragments, plastic materials, and other strange objects. Initially, the military reported that they had recovered a \"flying disc,\" but later claimed that it was actually a top-secret balloon reconnaissance project called \"Project Mogul.\"\n\n**UFO Conspiracy Theories (1947–1978)**\n\nAs news of the incident spread, UFO conspiracy theories began to emerge. One of the earliest and most enduring theories was the \"Aztec crashed saucer hoax,\" which claimed that a group of aliens had crashed a saucer in the desert and that the military had recovered the wreckage.\n\nAnother theory that gained traction was the \"Hangar 18\" story, which claimed that the military had recovered a UFO and was storing it in a secret hangar at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio.\n\n**Roswell Conspiracy Theories (1978–1994)**\n\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, a new wave of conspiracy theories emerged, focusing on the alleged cover-up of a UFO crash at Roswell. One of the key figures in this movement was Stanton Friedman, a physicist who claimed to have uncovered evidence of a military cover-up.\n\nFriedman's theory, known as \"The Roswell Incident,\" posited that a UFO had crashed at Roswell and that the military had recovered the wreckage, but had then covered it up to avoid panic. Friedman claimed to have interviewed witnesses who had seen the wreckage and had evidence of the military's involvement.\n\nAnother theory that gained traction during this period was the \"Majestic 12\" hoax, which claimed that a secret government agency had been formed to cover up UFO incidents and had been responsible for the Roswell cover-up.\n\n**Competing Accounts and Schism**\n\nAs the years passed, various competing accounts of the Roswell incident emerged, each with their own theories and explanations. Some claimed that the incident had been a hoax from the start, while others believed that it had been a genuine UFO sighting that had been covered up.\n\nOne of the most notable competing accounts was \"UFO Crash at Roswell,\" a book written by Kevin Randle and Donald Schmitt, which argued that the incident had been a real UFO sighting. The book presented new evidence and eyewitness accounts that supported the idea that the military had recovered a UFO.\n\nAnother account, \"Crash at Corona,\" written by Kevin Randle and Donald Schmitt, argued that the incident had been a real UFO sighting, but that the military had covered it up to avoid panic.\n\n**Air Force Response**\n\nIn 1994, the US Air Force released a report that claimed that the Roswell incident had been a top-secret balloon reconnaissance project called \"Project Mogul.\" The report stated that the project had been designed to detect Soviet nuclear tests and that the \"flying disc\" recovered at Roswell had been a balloon that had been used in the project.\n\nThe report was widely criticized by UFO enthusiasts and conspiracy theorists, who argued that it was a cover-up and that the military was still hiding the truth about the Roswell incident.\n\n**Later Theories and Hoaxes (1994–present)**\n\nIn the years since the Air Force report, various new theories and hoaxes have emerged. One of the most notable was the \"Alien Autopsy\" hoax, which claimed to show footage of an alien autopsy from the Roswell incident.\n\nAnother hoax that gained traction was \"The Day After Roswell,\" a book written by Philip Corso, which claimed to be a memoir of a military officer who had been involved in the Roswell cover-up.\n\n**Related Debunked or Fringe Theories**\n\nOver the years, various debunked or fringe theories have emerged, including the idea that the Roswell incident was a hoax from the start, or that it was a misidentification of a natural phenomenon.\n\nOne of the most enduring debunked theories is the \"Anthropomorphic dummies\" theory, which claims that the military had recovered a group of dummies that had been used in a top-secret experiment.\n\n**Explanations**\n\nDespite the various conspiracy theories and explanations, the true nature of the Roswell incident remains a mystery. Some believe that it was a genuine UFO sighting that was covered up by the military, while others argue that it was a hoax or a misidentification of a natural phenomenon.\n\nOne of the most widely accepted explanations is that the incident was a top-secret balloon reconnaissance project called \"Project Mogul,\" which was designed to detect Soviet nuclear tests. However, many UFO enthusiasts and conspiracy theorists argue that this explanation is a cover-up and that the military is still hiding the truth about the Roswell incident.\n\n**Roswell as Modern Myth and Folklore**\n\nThe Roswell incident has become a modern myth and folklore, with various stories and legends emerging over the years. It has been the subject of numerous books, films, and TV shows, and continues to captivate the public imagination.\n\nThe incident has also become a cultural phenomenon, with various tourist attractions and commercial ventures emerging in Roswell, including UFO-themed restaurants, shops, and museums.\n\n**Cultural Impact**\n\nThe Roswell incident has had a significant cultural impact, inspiring numerous books, films, and TV shows. It has also become a popular tourist destination, with many people visiting Roswell to experience the city's UFO-themed attractions.\n\nIn 1994, President Bill Clinton made a joke about the Roswell incident during a press conference, stating that he had asked the Air Force to release the truth about the incident, but that they had refused. The comment was widely reported and has become a famous quote from the president.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* **Project Mogul**\n* **Hangar 18**\n* **Majestic 12**\n* **UFO conspiracy theories**\n* **Roswell Army Air Field**\n* **Wright-Patterson Air Force Base**", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

This approach rejects the law of excluded middle (LEM) and the axiom of choice (AC), which are fundamental principles in classical set theory. Constructive set theory aims to provide a rigorous and systematic foundation for mathematics that is consistent with the principles of intuitionism.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nIn classical set theory, the law of excluded middle (LEM) and the axiom of choice (AC) are used to establish the foundations of mathematics. However, these principles have been criticized by constructivists, who argue that they lead to non-constructive proofs and incomplete developments. Constructive set theory, on the other hand, seeks to develop a rigorous and systematic foundation for mathematics that is consistent with the principles of intuitionism. This approach emphasizes the importance of constructive proofs and the use of mathematical objects as defined by constructive principles.\n\n**Constructive Outlook**\n\n### Preliminary on the use of intuitionistic logic\n\nConstructive set theory is based on intuitionistic logic, which is a type of logic that rejects the law of excluded middle (LEM). In intuitionistic logic, a statement is not considered true or false until it has been proven constructively. This means that a statement is only considered true if it can be demonstrated through a constructive proof, whereas a false statement can be disproven through a counterexample.\n\n### Imposed restrictions on a set theory\n\nConstructive set theory imposes restrictions on the set theory to ensure that it is consistent with the principles of intuitionism. These restrictions include the use of the axiom of extensionality, which states that two sets are equal if and only if they have the same elements. Additionally, constructive set theory restricts the use of the axiom of power set, which states that for every set, there exists a power set that contains all the subsets of the set.\n\n### Metalogic\n\nMetalogic is a branch of mathematics that studies the properties and relationships of logical systems. In constructive set theory, metalogic plays a crucial role in establishing the consistency and soundness of the system. Metalogic is used to study the properties of constructive proofs and to develop a rigorous foundation for mathematics.\n\n### Anti-classical principles\n\nConstructive set theory rejects the classical principles of mathematics, including the law of excluded middle (LEM) and the axiom of choice (AC). These principles have been criticized by constructivists, who argue that they lead to non-constructive proofs and incomplete developments.

It is a common and usually harmless condition that affects millions of children worldwide.\n\n**Signs and symptoms**\n======================\n\n### Types\n\nFebrile seizures can be classified into two main types: simple and complex.\n\n*   Simple febrile seizures are the most common type, characterized by a short duration (less than 15 minutes) and a single seizure episode. They often occur during the first three years of life and are usually associated with a mild fever.\n*   Complex febrile seizures are more severe and are characterized by a longer duration (more than 15 minutes), multiple seizure episodes, or a focal seizure (affecting one part of the body). They often occur in older children and are associated with a higher temperature.\n\n### Clinical presentation\n\nChildren experiencing a febrile seizure may exhibit a range of symptoms, including:\n\n*   A high body temperature, usually above 38°C (100.4°F)\n*   Convulsions or seizures, which can range from mild to severe\n*   Loss of consciousness or altered mental state\n*   Stiffness or rigidity of the body\n*   Abnormal posturing or movements\n*   Incontinence of urine or stool\n\n### Duration and frequency\n\nFebrile seizures can vary in duration and frequency. Some children may experience a single seizure episode, while others may have multiple episodes over several hours or days.\n\n### Age and risk factors\n\nFebrile seizures typically occur in children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years, with the majority occurring between 12 and 18 months. Children with a family history of febrile seizures are more likely to experience them themselves.\n\n**Causes**\n==========\n\nThe exact cause of febrile seizures is not yet fully understood, but several factors are thought to contribute to their development:\n\n*   Fever: High body temperature is the primary trigger for febrile seizures.\n*   Genetic predisposition: Children with a family history of febrile seizures are more likely to experience them themselves.\n*   Age: Febrile seizures typically occur in children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years.\n*   Infection: Certain infections, such as ear infections or urinary tract infections, can trigger febrile seizures.\n*   Medications: Certain medications, such as antibiotics or antihistamines, can increase the risk of febrile seizures.\n\n**Mechanism**\n=============\n\nThe exact mechanism of febrile seizures is not yet fully understood, but several theories have been proposed:\n\n*   Temperature-sensitive neurons: High body temperature may cause certain neurons in the brain to become more excitable, leading to seizures.\n*   Changes in brain chemistry: Fever may alter the balance of neurotransmitters in the brain, leading to seizures.\n*   Hypoxia: Reduced oxygen levels in the brain may contribute to the development of febrile seizures.\n\n**Diagnosis**\n============\n\nDiagnosing febrile seizures can be challenging, as the symptoms can be similar to those of other conditions. A diagnosis is typically made based on the following criteria:\n\n*   A high body temperature, usually above 38°C (100.4°F)\n*   Convulsions or seizures\n*   No evidence of other underlying conditions that may be causing the seizures\n\n**Prevention**\n=============\n\nWhile it is not possible to completely prevent febrile seizures, several strategies can help reduce the risk:\n\n*   Maintaining a healthy body temperature: Keeping the child's body temperature within a normal range can help prevent febrile seizures.\n*   Using medication: In some cases, medication may be prescribed to help prevent febrile seizures.\n*   Avoiding certain medications: Certain medications, such as antibiotics or antihistamines, can increase the risk of febrile seizures.\n*   Providing a safe environment: Ensuring the child's environment is safe and free from hazards can help prevent injuries during a seizure.\n\n**Treatment**\n============\n\nTreatment for febrile seizures typically involves managing the underlying fever and providing supportive care:\n\n*   Medication: Medications such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen may be prescribed to help reduce the fever.\n*   Rest: The child should be given plenty of rest and time to recover.\n*   Hydration: Ensuring the child stays hydrated is essential.\n*   Monitoring: The child should be closely monitored for any signs of complications or worsening symptoms.\n\n**Prognosis**\n============\n\nThe prognosis for children who experience febrile seizures is generally excellent. Most children who experience febrile seizures do not have any long-term effects, and the seizures typically resolve on their own.\n\n**Epidemiology**\n==============\n\nFebrile seizures are a common condition that affects millions of children worldwide. The exact prevalence of febrile seizures is not yet fully understood, but it is estimated that:\n\n*   3-5% of children experience febrile seizures\n*   Febrile seizures typically occur in children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years\n*   Boys are more likely to experience febrile seizures than girls\n*   Children with a family history of febrile seizures are more likely to experience them themselves", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

In 1987, a group of environmentalists and activists in California formed the Green Party of California, which was initially known as the \"California Green Party.\" The party was officially registered with the California Secretary of State's office in 1991.\n\n### Qualifying for elections\n\nTo qualify for elections in California, the Green Party of California must meet certain criteria, including filing a nomination document with the Secretary of State's office and paying a filing fee. The party must also submit a list of its qualified candidates for each election. In addition, the party must demonstrate that it has a minimum number of registered voters who support its candidates.\n\n### Electoral milestones\n\nThe Green Party of California has experienced several electoral milestones over the years. In 1992, the party's presidential candidate, David McReynolds, received over 71,000 votes in California, marking a significant increase in the party's visibility and vote share. In 2000, the party's nominee for governor, Dan Hamburg, garnered over 150,000 votes, despite being outspent by his opponents.\n\n### Top-two primaries\n\nIn 2010, California voters approved Proposition 14, which established a top-two primary system for state and federal elections. Under this system, all candidates, regardless of party affiliation, compete in the same primary election, and the top two finishers advance to the general election. The Green Party of California has argued that this system has made it more difficult for third-party candidates to gain traction and compete with the major parties.\n\n## Platform\n\nThe Green Party of California has adopted a comprehensive platform that reflects the party's values and priorities. Some key planks of the platform include:\n\n* Environmental protection: The party advocates for a transition to 100% renewable energy, the protection of California's natural resources, and the preservation of wildlife habitats.\n* Social justice: The party supports policies that promote economic and social equality, including affordable housing, education, and healthcare.\n* Democracy and transparency: The party advocates for campaign finance reform, the protection of voting rights, and the promotion of open government and transparency.\n\n## Organization\n\nThe Green Party of California is a decentralized organization with a network of local chapters and a statewide leadership structure. The party's organizational structure includes:\n\n* **Membership**: The party has a membership model that allows individuals to join and participate in the party's activities and decision-making process.\n* **State Central Committee**: The State Central Committee is the party's governing body, which meets regularly to make decisions and set party policy.\n* **Regional Councils**: The party has a system of regional councils, which serve as a liaison between the party's local chapters and the state leadership.\n\n## Current elected officials\n\nThe Green Party of California has had several elected officials at the local and state levels. Some notable examples include:\n\n### Mayoral offices\n\n* **San Francisco**: In 2011, the Green Party's John Rinaldi ran for mayor of San Francisco and received over 20,000 votes.\n* **Santa Cruz**: In 2014, the Green Party's Drew Glover won a seat on the Santa Cruz City Council, becoming the party's first elected official in the city.\n\n### Municipal councils\n\n* **Berkeley**: In 2016, the Green Party's Sofia Pereira won a seat on the Berkeley City Council.\n* **Arcata**: In 2018, the Green Party's Michael Winkler won a seat on the Arcata City Council.\n\n## Election results\n\nThe Green Party of California has participated in several presidential and gubernatorial elections. The party's performance in these elections has varied, but it has generally struggled to gain significant traction.\n\n### Presidential\n\n* **1992**: David McReynolds received over 71,000 votes in California, marking a significant increase in the party's visibility and vote share.\n* **2000**: The party's nominee, Pat LaMarche, received over 30,000 votes in California.\n* **2004**: The party's nominee, David Cobb, received over 13,000 votes in California.\n* **2016**: The party's nominee, Jill Stein, received over 145,000 votes in California.\n\n### Gubernatorial\n\n* **2000**: The party's nominee, Dan Hamburg, received over 150,000 votes in California.\n* **2006**: The party's nominee, Peter Camejo, received over 100,000 votes in California.\n* **2010**: The party's nominee, Laura Wells, received over 70,000 votes in California.\n* **2014**: The party's nominee, Luis Rodriguez, received over 40,000 votes in California.\n\n### Election qualifying\n\nTo participate in elections in California, the Green Party of California must meet certain criteria, including filing a nomination document with the Secretary of State's office and paying a filing fee. The party must also submit a list of its qualified candidates for each election.\n\n## Notable members\n\nThe Green Party of California has had several notable members over the years, including:\n\n* **David McReynolds**: A longtime peace activist and presidential candidate for the Green Party.\n* **Pat LaMarche**: A presidential candidate for the Green Party in 2000 and a well-known activist.\n* **Dan Hamburg**: A former member of the U.S. House of Representatives and the Green Party's gubernatorial nominee in 2000.\n* **Peter Camejo**: A former member of the Socialist Workers Party and the Green Party's gubernatorial nominee in 2006.\n\n## See also\n\n* Green Party of the United States\n* California politics\n* Third-party politics in the United States\n\n## Notes\n\nThis article is a general overview of the Green Party of California.

He made significant contributions to various fields, including metaphysics, epistemology, philosophy of mind, aesthetics, and the philosophy of history. Hegel's philosophical system is known for its complexity and depth, and it has had a profound impact on modern philosophy, influencing thinkers such as Karl Marx, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Martin Heidegger.\n\n# Life\n\n## Formative years\n\n### Stuttgart, Tübingen, Berne, Frankfurt (1770–1800)\n\nHegel was born in Stuttgart, a city in the German state of Württemberg. His father, Georg Ludwig Friedrich Hegel, was a revenue officer at the court of the Duke of Württemberg, and his mother, Maria Magdalena Fromm, was the daughter of a minister. Hegel was the third of three children, and his family was considered to be part of the lower nobility. Hegel's early education took place at the Stuttgart Gymnasium, where he excelled in languages, philosophy, and mathematics. In 1788, he enrolled at the University of Tübingen, where he studied theology, philosophy, and literature. During his time at Tübingen, Hegel became interested in the ideas of Immanuel Kant and Friedrich Schiller, which would later influence his own philosophical thought.\n\nIn 1793, Hegel moved to Berne, Switzerland, where he worked as a tutor for a family. During this period, he became acquainted with the ideas of Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, which had a significant impact on his early philosophical development. In 1797, Hegel returned to Frankfurt, where he worked as a tutor and began to develop his own philosophical ideas.\n\n## Career years\n\n### Jena, Bamberg, Nuremberg (1801–1816)\n\nIn 1801, Hegel moved to Jena, a city in the German state of Thuringia, where he became a lecturer in philosophy at the University of Jena. During this period, he developed his philosophical system, which was heavily influenced by the ideas of Kant, Fichte, and Schelling. In 1807, Hegel published his first major work, The Phenomenology of Spirit, which outlined his philosophical system and introduced the concept of absolute idealism.\n\nIn 1807, Hegel also became involved in the Jena Romantic circle, a group of writers and intellectuals who were associated with the early Romantic movement. However, Hegel's philosophical ideas were not well received by the Romantic circle, and he eventually left Jena in 1816.\n\n### Heidelberg, Berlin (1816–1831)\n\nIn 1816, Hegel moved to Heidelberg, where he became a professor of philosophy at the University of Heidelberg. During this period, he developed his philosophical system further and published several important works, including The Science of Logic and The Philosophy of Nature.\n\nIn 1818, Hegel moved to Berlin, where he became a professor of philosophy at the University of Berlin. During this period, he became a prominent figure in Berlin intellectual life and was associated with the Prussian Academy of Arts. Hegel's lectures in Berlin were highly influential, and he developed a large following of students and admirers.\n\n# Influences\n\nHegel's philosophical system was influenced by a wide range of thinkers, including Kant, Fichte, Schelling, Rousseau, and Goethe. However, Hegel's most significant influence was Immanuel Kant, whose Critique of Pure Reason (1781) laid the foundation for Hegel's own philosophical system.\n\nHegel was also influenced by the German Idealist movement, which emphasized the importance of subjective experience and the role of the individual in shaping reality. However, Hegel's philosophical system also incorporated elements of rationalism and empiricism, which emphasized the importance of reason and experience in understanding the world.\n\n# The Phenomenology of Spirit\n\nThe Phenomenology of Spirit is Hegel's most famous work, and it outlines his philosophical system in detail. The work is divided into several sections, each of which explores a different stage of human consciousness. The work begins with a discussion of the nature of consciousness and the relationship between the individual and the world.\n\nHegel argues that consciousness is a dynamic and changing process, and that it can never be static or fixed. He also argues that consciousness is not simply a reflection of reality, but is an active and creative process that shapes and transforms the world.\n\nThe Phenomenology of Spirit is a complex and difficult work, and it has been the subject of much interpretation and debate. However, it remains one of the most important and influential works in the history of philosophy.\n\n# Philosophical system\n\nHegel's philosophical system is based on the concept of absolute idealism, which holds that reality is a product of the human mind. Hegel argues that the world is not an independent reality, but is a creation of the human mind, which shapes and transforms it through the process of dialectics.\n\nHegel's system consists of several key concepts, including science, logic, and the philosophy of nature and spirit. Science is the study of the natural world, while logic is the study of the principles of reasoning and thought.

Being is the static and unchanging aspect of reality, while becoming is the dynamic and changing aspect of reality. The absolute is the highest level of understanding, which is the unity of being and becoming.\n\n## Philosophy of the real\n\nThe philosophy of the real is the study of the natural world, which is the object of scientific inquiry. Hegel argues that the natural world is a product of the human mind, and that it can be understood through the process of dialectics.\n\nHegel's philosophy of the real is based on several key concepts, including the concept of nature and the concept of matter. Nature is the totality of all existing things, while matter is the substance of which all things are composed.\n\n## The Philosophy of Nature\n\nThe Philosophy of Nature is a work that outlines Hegel's system of the philosophy of nature, which is based on the concept of dialectics. Hegel argues that the natural world is a product of the human mind, and that it can be understood through the process of dialectics.\n\nHegel's system of the philosophy of nature is based on several key concepts, including the concept of nature and the concept of matter. Nature is the totality of all existing things, while matter is the substance of which all things are composed.\n\n## The Philosophy of Spirit\n\nThe Philosophy of Spirit is a work that outlines Hegel's system of the philosophy of spirit, which is based on the concept of dialectics. Hegel argues that the human mind is a product of the human mind, and that it can be understood through the process of dialectics.\n\nHegel's system of the philosophy of spirit is based on several key concepts, including the concept of subjective spirit, objective spirit, and absolute spirit. Subjective spirit is the individual human mind, while objective spirit is the collective human mind. Absolute spirit is the highest level of understanding, which is the unity of subjective and objective spirit.\n\n### Subjective spirit\n\nSubjective spirit is the individual human mind, which is the source of all thought and action. Hegel argues that the subjective spirit is the highest level of understanding, and that it can only be understood through the process of dialectics.\n\n### Objective spirit\n\nObjective spirit is the collective human mind, which is the source of all culture and history. Hegel argues that the objective spirit is the product of the subjective spirit, and that it can be understood through the process of dialectics.\n\n### Absolute spirit\n\nAbsolute spirit is the highest level of understanding, which is the unity of subjective and objective spirit. Hegel argues that the absolute spirit is the ultimate reality, and that it can only be understood through the process of dialectics.\n\n# Philosophy of art\n\nHegel's philosophy of art is based on the concept of the absolute, which is the ultimate reality. Hegel argues that art is a product of the human mind, and that it can only be understood through the process of dialectics.\n\nHegel's system of the philosophy of art is based on several key concepts, including the concept of beauty and the concept of truth. Beauty is the product of the human mind, while truth is the ultimate reality.\n\n# Christianity\n\nHegel's philosophy of Christianity is based on the concept of the absolute, which is the ultimate reality. Hegel argues that Christianity is a product of the human mind, and that it can only be understood through the process of dialectics.\n\nHegel's system of the philosophy of Christianity is based on several key concepts, including the concept of God and the concept of the absolute. God is the ultimate reality, while the absolute is the unity of God and humanity.\n\n## Early Romantic writings\n\nHegel's early Romantic writings are characterized by a focus on the individual and the subjective experience. Hegel argues that the individual is the source of all thought and action, and that the subjective experience is the ultimate reality.\n\n## The Phenomenology of Spirit\n\nThe Phenomenology of Spirit is a work that outlines Hegel's system of the philosophy of spirit, which is based on the concept of dialectics.

Hegel argues that the absolute is the unity of God and humanity, and that it can only be understood through the process of dialectics.\n\n## Issues of interpretation\n\nHegel's philosophy has been the subject of much interpretation and debate. Some have argued that Hegel's philosophy is a form of absolute idealism, while others have argued that it is a form of absolute materialism.\n\n# Philosophy of history\n\nHegel's philosophy of history is based on the concept of dialectics, which is the process of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. Hegel argues that history is a product of the human mind, and that it can be understood through the process of dialectics.\n\nHegel's system of the philosophy of history is based on several key concepts, including the concept of the absolute and the concept of the dialectic. The absolute is the ultimate reality, while the dialectic is the process of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis.\n\n# Dialectics, speculation, idealism\n\nDialectics is the process of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis, where the thesis and antithesis are opposing ideas that are united in a higher level of understanding. Speculation is the process of abstract thought, where the individual thinks about the abstract concepts of reality. Idealism is the philosophy that reality is a product of the human mind.\n\n## Thesis–antithesis–synthesis\n\nThe thesis-antithesis-synthesis dialectic is the process of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis, where the thesis and antithesis are opposing ideas that are united in a higher level of understanding. The thesis is the initial idea, the antithesis is the opposing idea, and the synthesis is the higher level of understanding that results from the thesis and antithesis.\n\n# Reception\n\nHegel's philosophy has had a profound impact on modern philosophy, influencing thinkers such as Karl Marx, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Martin Heidegger. However, Hegel's philosophy has also been the subject of much criticism and interpretation.\n\n## \"Right\" vs. \"Left\" Hegelianism\n\nHegel's philosophy has been divided into two camps: the \"right\" Hegelians and the \"left\" Hegelians. The \"right\" Hegelians emphasize the importance of reason and the role of the individual in shaping reality, while the \"left\" Hegelians emphasize the importance of the collective and the role of history in shaping reality.\n\n## Reception in France\n\nHegel's philosophy was widely influential in France, where it was associated with the development of existentialism and phenomenology.

He is widely regarded as the \"Father of the Constitution\" and played a leading role in the drafting and adoption of the document. Madison's presidency was marked by significant events, including the War of 1812 and the decline of the Federalist opposition. This article provides an overview of Madison's life, from his early years to his presidency and post-presidency.\n\n**Early life and education**\n\nJames Madison was born on March 16, 1751, in Port Conway, Virginia, to Colonel James Madison Sr. and Nelly Conway Madison. He was the eldest of 12 children in a family of large landowners. Madison's early education took place at home, where he was tutored by private instructors. In 1769, he enrolled at the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University), where he excelled academically and developed a strong interest in politics.\n\nMadison's time at college was marked by his participation in the American Whig Society, a debating club that promoted American patriotism and independence from British rule. After graduating in 1771, Madison returned to Virginia and began studying law under the tutelage of Thomas Jefferson. However, Madison never pursued a career as a lawyer, instead focusing on politics and public service.\n\n**American Revolution and Articles of Confederation**\n\nAs the American Revolution gained momentum, Madison became increasingly involved in politics. In 1776, he joined the Virginia Convention, where he played a key role in drafting the state's Declaration of Rights. The following year, Madison was appointed to the Virginia House of Delegates, where he served as a delegate to the Continental Congress.\n\nDuring this period, Madison was instrumental in shaping the Articles of Confederation, which served as the first constitution of the United States. Although the Articles ultimately proved inadequate for governing the new nation, they provided a foundation for the more robust document that would follow.\n\n**Ratification of the Constitution**\n\nIn 1787, Madison was a key delegate to the Constitutional Convention, where he played a leading role in drafting the United States Constitution. Madison's contributions to the document include the establishment of a system of checks and balances, as well as the concept of federalism. The Constitution was ratified in 1788, with Madison's home state of Virginia being the tenth state to do so.\n\n**Congressman and party leader (1789–1801)**\n\n**Election to Congress**\n\nIn 1789, Madison was elected to the House of Representatives, where he served as a representative of Virginia's 5th congressional district. During his time in Congress, Madison was a vocal advocate for the Constitution and played a key role in shaping the new government.\n\n**Bill of Rights**\n\nIn 1789, Madison introduced the Bill of Rights, a set of amendments to the Constitution that aimed to protect individual liberties and limit government power. The Bill of Rights was eventually ratified in 1791, with Madison's Virginia being the 11th state to do so.\n\n**Founding the Democratic–Republican Party**\n\nIn 1791, Madison, along with Thomas Jefferson, founded the Democratic–Republican Party, which became a major force in American politics. The party was dedicated to limited government, individual liberty, and states' rights.\n\n**Marriage and family**\n\nIn 1794, Madison married Dolley Payne Todd, a widow with a young son. The couple had no children of their own, but Dolley played an important role in Madison's life, serving as a hostess and advisor.\n\n**Adams presidency**\n\nDuring John Adams' presidency, Madison served as a vocal critic of the administration's policies, particularly its Alien and Sedition Acts. Although Madison was not a fan of Adams, he maintained a cordial relationship with the president and continued to serve in Congress.\n\n**Secretary of State (1801–1809)**\n\nIn 1801, Madison was appointed Secretary of State by President Thomas Jefferson, with whom he had a close relationship. During his time in the position, Madison played a key role in shaping American foreign policy, particularly in regards to the Louisiana Purchase.\n\n**1808 presidential election**\n\nIn 1808, Madison ran for president as the Democratic–Republican candidate, defeating Federalist candidate Charles Pinckney. Madison's victory marked the beginning of a significant shift in American politics, as the Democratic–Republicans would go on to dominate the national stage for decades to come.\n\n**Presidency (1809–1817)**\n\n**Inauguration and cabinet**\n\nMadison's inauguration took place on March 4, 1809, with Vice President George Clinton by his side. Madison's cabinet included notable figures such as Secretary of State Robert Smith and Secretary of War Henry Dearborn.\n\n**War of 1812**\n\n### Prelude to war\n\nThe War of 1812 was sparked by a combination of factors, including British impressment of American sailors and trade restrictions. Madison faced significant opposition from his own party, with many members opposed to the war. However, Madison believed that the conflict was necessary to preserve American sovereignty and national honor.\n\n### Military actions\n\nThe war was fought on multiple fronts, with American forces facing off against British and Native American forces. Although the war was marked by several significant American victories, the conflict ultimately ended in a stalemate.\n\n**Postwar period and decline of the Federalist opposition**\n\nFollowing the War of 1812, the Federalist Party began to decline, with many of its leaders abandoning the party or changing their positions. The Democratic–Republican Party, on the other hand, continued to dominate American politics.\n\n**Native American policy**\n\nDuring Madison's presidency, the United States government implemented a series of policies aimed at relocating Native American tribes and expanding American territory. Although these policies were often brutal and inhumane, they marked a significant shift in American approach to Native American relations.\n\n**Election of 1816**\n\nIn 1816, Madison was re-elected as president, defeating Federalist candidate Rufus King. Madison's victory marked the beginning of a new era in American politics, with the Democratic–Republicans holding significant sway over the national stage.\n\n**Post-presidency (1817–1836)**\n\n**Death**\n\nMadison died on June 28, 1836, at the age of 85, after a long illness. He was buried in the Montpelier family cemetery, alongside his wife Dolley.\n\n**Political and religious views**\n\n### Federalism\n\nMadison was a strong advocate for federalism, believing that a robust federal government was necessary to preserve American unity and sovereignty. However, he also believed in limiting government power and protecting individual liberties.\n\n### Religion\n\nMadison was a devout Episcopalian, attending church regularly throughout his life. However, he also believed in the separation of church and state, and was a vocal critic of the Federalist Party's attempts to establish an official church.\n\n**Slavery**\n\nMadison was a slaveowner, owning several slaves throughout his life. However, he also believed in gradual emancipation, and advocated for the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nMadison's legacy is complex and multifaceted. He is widely regarded as the \"Father of the Constitution,\" and his contributions to the document remain significant to this day. However, his presidency was also marked by controversy, particularly in regards to the War of 1812 and Native American policy.\n\nDespite these challenges, Madison remains an important figure in American history, and his impact on the country's development continues to be felt. His commitment to federalism, individual liberty, and limited government power has shaped American politics for centuries, and his legacy serves as a reminder of the importance of protecting these fundamental principles.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.
