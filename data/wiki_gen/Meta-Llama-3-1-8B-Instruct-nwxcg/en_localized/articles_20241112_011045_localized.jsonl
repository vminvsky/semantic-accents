The counteroffensive was a significant turning point in the war, as it resulted in the liberation of large areas of Ukrainian territory and significant losses for the Russian military.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine, which began in February 2022, had resulted in significant losses for the Ukrainian military. However, the Ukrainian forces had managed to hold off the Russian advance and had even launched several counterattacks in the south and east of the country. The city of Kharkiv, in northeastern Ukraine, was a key target for the Russian military, as it was a major industrial and cultural center.\n\n**Prelude**\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the counteroffensive, Ukrainian forces had been gathering intelligence and preparing for a major attack. They had identified several weaknesses in the Russian defenses, including a lack of troops and equipment in certain areas. The Ukrainian military had also been working to improve their communication and logistics systems, which would be crucial for a successful counterattack.\n\n**Counteroffensive**\n\nThe Ukrainian counteroffensive began on September 6, 2022, with a series of coordinated attacks along a 300-kilometer front. The initial target was the city of Izyum, which was a key transportation hub and a major Russian military base.\n\n**First phase (6–12 September 2022)**\n\n### Initial Advance\n\nThe Ukrainian forces made a rapid advance, pushing deep into Russian-held territory. They quickly captured several key towns and villages, including Balakliya and Kupiansk. The Russian military was caught off guard, and their defenses were quickly breached.\n\n### Breakthrough\n\nThe Ukrainian forces continued to push forward, breaking through the Russian lines and gaining control of several strategic locations. They captured key infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and communication networks.\n\n### Russian withdrawal from Kharkiv Oblast west of Oskil River\n\nThe Russian military began to withdraw from Kharkiv Oblast, abandoning several key towns and villages. The Ukrainian forces continued to advance, pushing deep into Russian-held territory.\n\n### Other gains and casualties\n\nThe Ukrainian forces made significant gains, capturing several key locations and pushing deep into Russian-held territory. However, they also suffered significant casualties, including the loss of several high-ranking officers.\n\n**Battle of Shevchenkove**\n\nThe Battle of Shevchenkove was a intense fight between Ukrainian and Russian forces. The Ukrainian forces, led by the 92nd Mechanized Brigade, launched a surprise attack on the Russian-held town of Shevchenkove. The Russian military put up a fierce resistance, but the Ukrainian forces eventually broke through and captured the town.\n\n**Second phase (13 September–1 October 2022)**\n\n### Oskil River crossing\n\nThe Ukrainian forces continued to push forward, crossing the Oskil River and pushing deep into Russian-held territory. They quickly captured several key locations, including the town of Lyman.\n\n### Encirclement and recapture of Lyman\n\nThe Ukrainian forces encircled the Russian-held city of Lyman, cutting off supply lines and communication networks. The Russian military was unable to hold out, and the city was eventually recaptured by the Ukrainian forces.\n\n**Reactions**\n\n### Russia\n\nThe Russian military was caught off guard by the sudden and rapid advance of the Ukrainian forces. They had underestimated the capabilities of the Ukrainian military, and their defenses were quickly breached. The Russian government was forced to issue a statement condemning the actions of the Ukrainian military and promising to take action to defend Russian interests.\n\n### Worldwide\n\nThe international community was shocked by the rapid advance of the Ukrainian forces. The United States, European Union, and other countries issued statements condemning the actions of the Russian military and calling for a ceasefire. The United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting to discuss the situation.\n\n**Aftermath of the first phase**\n\n### Mass graves and evidence of torture\n\nThe Ukrainian forces discovered several mass graves and evidence of torture in the areas they liberated. The evidence suggested that the Russian military had committed war crimes, including the killing of civilians and the torture of prisoners.\n\n### Military decorations\n\nThe Ukrainian government awarded several military decorations to the soldiers who participated in the counteroffensive. The decorations recognized the bravery and sacrifice of the soldiers and their contributions to the war effort.\n\n### Effect on Russian referendums\n\nThe counteroffensive had a significant impact on the Russian referendums, which were scheduled to take place in several regions of Ukraine. The referendums were seen as a attempt by the Russian government to legitimize their control over the areas they had occupied. However, the counteroffensive made it clear that the Russian military was not in control of the territory, and the referendums were seen as a attempt to legitimize a fait accompli.\n\n### Captured Russian equipment\n\nThe Ukrainian forces captured significant amounts of Russian equipment, including tanks, artillery, and ammunition. The equipment was a significant boost to the Ukrainian military, and it helped to level the playing field against the Russian military.\n\n**Aftermath of the second phase**\n\nThe second phase of the counteroffensive was marked by a significant shift in the balance of power on the battlefield. The Ukrainian forces had made significant gains, pushing deep into Russian-held territory and capturing several key locations. The Russian military was in disarray, and their defenses were breached in several areas. The international community was calling for a ceasefire, and the Russian government was facing significant pressure to withdraw their forces from Ukraine.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Russian invasion of Ukraine\n* Battle of Izyum\n* Battle of Balakliya\n* Battle of Lyman\n\n**Notes**\n\nThis article is based on information from various sources, including Ukrainian government statements, international news agencies, and eyewitness accounts.

The RAOB is known for its unique blend of mysticism, symbolism, and philanthropy, and has a significant presence in several countries around the world.\n\n**Coverage**\n\nThe RAOB is a global organization with a presence in several countries, including the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. The organization has a complex structure, with multiple degrees, lodges, and banners that operate under different jurisdictions.\n\n**Membership**\n\nMembership in the RAOB is open to individuals who are at least 21 years old and of good character. Members are typically required to undergo a series of rituals and ceremonies, which are designed to test their knowledge, courage, and loyalty. Once initiated, members are entitled to wear distinctive regalia, including a buffalo-shaped badge and a sash with a unique symbol or motto.\n\n**Structure**\n\nThe RAOB has a complex structure, with multiple levels of organization. At the top of the hierarchy is the Grand Council, which is responsible for overseeing the entire organization. Below the Grand Council are the Grand Lodges, which are responsible for a specific region or country. The Grand Lodges are further divided into individual lodges, each of which has its own unique name and charter.\n\n### Degrees\n\nThe RAOB has a system of degrees, which are designed to test the knowledge, courage, and loyalty of its members. The degrees are typically conferred in a series of rituals and ceremonies, which are overseen by senior members of the lodge. The degrees are as follows:\n\n* First Degree: The first degree is known as the \"Buffalo\" degree, and is typically conferred on new members. The degree is designed to introduce the new member to the principles and traditions of the RAOB.\n* Second Degree: The second degree is known as the \"Antediluvian\" degree, and is typically conferred on members who have completed the first degree. The degree is designed to test the member's knowledge of the organization's history and traditions.\n* Third Degree: The third degree is known as the \"Royal\" degree, and is typically conferred on members who have completed the second degree. The degree is designed to test the member's knowledge of the organization's symbolism and mysticism.\n\n### Minor Lodges\n\nIn addition to the regular lodges, the RAOB also has a system of minor lodges. Minor lodges are smaller, more informal groups that are typically affiliated with a regular lodge. Minor lodges are often used to recruit new members and to provide a more intimate and informal setting for socializing and charitable activities.\n\n### Banners\n\nThe RAOB has a system of banners, which are used to identify specific lodges or jurisdictions. The banners are typically displayed at lodge meetings and events, and are an important part of the organization's symbolism and tradition.\n\n### Use of \"Royal\"\n\nThe RAOB uses the term \"Royal\" to refer to its highest degree and to its Grand Council. The use of \"Royal\" is a nod to the organization's history and its connections to the British monarchy.\n\n### Dispensations\n\nThe RAOB has a system of dispensations, which are used to grant special permissions or exceptions to individual members or lodges. Dispensations are typically granted by the Grand Council or a Grand Lodge, and are used to resolve specific problems or issues.\n\n### Motto\n\nThe RAOB has a motto, which is \"Fidelity, Loyalty, and Friendship.\" The motto is displayed on the organization's regalia and is an important part of its symbolism and tradition.\n\n### Lodge names and associations\n\nLodges in the RAOB are typically named after specific places, people, or events. The names of lodges are often associated with the organization's history and traditions, and are an important part of its symbolism and culture.\n\n### Absent Brothers Toast\n\nThe RAOB has a tradition of raising a toast to absent brothers, which are members who are unable to attend a lodge meeting or event. The toast is typically given by the lodge's master or senior warden.\n\n### Grand Council Absent Brothers Toast\n\nThe Grand Council has a tradition of raising a toast to absent brothers, which is similar to the lodge-level toast.

Nonmetals are typically dull, brittle, and poor conductors of electricity. They are an essential part of the periodic table, making up the nonmetal group, which is a distinct category of elements.\n\nDefinition and Applicable Elements\n--------------------------------\n\nThe definition of a nonmetal is not strictly tied to a specific set of elements, as some elements exhibit properties that are intermediate between metals and nonmetals. However, most nonmetals are found in the p-block of the periodic table, which includes the elements to the right of the metalloids (boron, silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony, tellurium, and polonium).\n\nGeneral Properties\n-----------------\n\n### Physical\n\nNonmetals have several distinct physical properties that distinguish them from metals. These properties include:\n\n*   **Dull appearance**: Nonmetals are typically dull and lack the luster of metals.\n*   **Brittleness**: Nonmetals are brittle and prone to cracking or breaking under stress.\n*   **Poor conductivity**: Nonmetals are poor conductors of electricity and heat.\n\n#### Allotropes\n\nSome nonmetals exhibit allotropy, which is the ability of an element to exist in multiple forms or allotropes. For example, carbon exists as graphite and diamond, while oxygen exists as O2 and ozone (O3).\n\n### Chemical\n\nNonmetals have several distinct chemical properties that distinguish them from metals. These properties include:\n\n*   **Reactivity**: Nonmetals are highly reactive, particularly when exposed to air or water.\n*   **Acid-base properties**: Nonmetals can exhibit acidic or basic properties, depending on their reactivity.\n*   **Multiple bond formation**: Nonmetals can form multiple bonds with other elements, particularly with metals.\n\n#### Complications\n\nThe distinction between metals and nonmetals is not always clear-cut, as some elements exhibit properties that are intermediate between the two. Some of the complications in classifying elements as metals or nonmetals include:\n\n*   **First row anomaly**: The first row of the periodic table (hydrogen, helium, lithium, beryllium, boron, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, neon) exhibits some properties that are intermediate between metals and nonmetals.\n*   **Secondary periodicity**: The periodic table exhibits a secondary periodicity, where elements in the same group or family exhibit similar properties.\n*   **Higher oxidation states**: Nonmetals can exhibit higher oxidation states, particularly when exposed to air or water.\n*   **Multiple bond formation**: Nonmetals can form multiple bonds with other elements, particularly with metals.\n*   **Property overlaps**: Some elements exhibit properties that overlap with both metals and nonmetals.\n\nTypes\n-----\n\n### Noble Gases\n\nNoble gases are a group of elements that are unreactive and exhibit properties that are intermediate between metals and nonmetals. They include:\n\n*   **Helium**: A colorless, odorless gas that is used as a lifting gas in balloons and airships.\n*   **Neon**: A bright orange-red gas that is used in neon signs and other lighting applications.\n*   **Argon**: A colorless, odorless gas that is used in light bulbs and other applications.\n*   **Krypton**: A colorless, odorless gas that is used in fluorescent lighting and other applications.\n*   **Xenon**: A colorless, odorless gas that is used in high-intensity lamps and other applications.\n*   **Radon**: A radioactive gas that is used in cancer treatment and other medical applications.\n\n### Halogen Nonmetals\n\nHalogen nonmetals are a group of elements that are highly reactive and exhibit properties that are intermediate between metals and nonmetals. They include:\n\n*   **Fluorine**: A pale yellow gas that is highly reactive and used in a variety of applications.\n*   **Chlorine**: A greenish-yellow gas that is highly reactive and used in water treatment and other applications.\n*   **Bromine**: A reddish-brown liquid that is highly reactive and used in a variety of applications.\n*   **Iodine**: A dark purple solid that is highly reactive and used in a variety of applications.\n*   **Astatine**: A highly radioactive solid that is highly reactive and used in cancer treatment and other medical applications.\n\n### Unclassified Nonmetals\n\nUnclassified nonmetals are a group of elements that do not fit into any of the above categories. They include:\n\n*   **Phosphorus**: A yellowish-white solid that is highly reactive and used in a variety of applications.\n*   **Sulfur**: A yellowish-white solid that is highly reactive and used in a variety of applications.\n*   **Se**: A highly reactive metalloid that is used in a variety of applications.\n*   **Te**: A highly reactive metalloid that is used in a variety of applications.\n*   **Po**: A highly radioactive metalloid that is used in cancer treatment and other medical applications.\n\nAbundance, Extraction, and Uses\n--------------------------------\n\n### Abundance\n\nNonmetals are found in the Earth's crust and atmosphere, with varying degrees of abundance. Some of the most abundant nonmetals include:\n\n*   **Oxygen**: The most abundant nonmetal, making up approximately 46% of the Earth's crust.\n*   **Silicon**: The second most abundant nonmetal, making up approximately 28% of the Earth's crust.\n*   **Aluminum**: A highly reactive metal that is found in the Earth's crust and atmosphere.\n*   **Carbon**: A highly reactive element that is found in the Earth's crust and atmosphere.\n\n### Extraction\n\nNonmetals can be extracted from the Earth's crust and atmosphere using a variety of methods. Some of the most common methods include:\n\n*   **Mining**: The extraction of nonmetals from the Earth's crust using open-pit or underground mining techniques.\n*   **Refining**: The processing of nonmetals to remove impurities and produce a pure product.\n*   **Smelting**: The heating of nonmetals to high temperatures to extract the desired metal.\n\n### Uses\n\nNonmetals have a wide range of uses in various industries, including:\n\n*   **Energy**: Nonmetals are used in the production of energy, including electricity and fuels.\n*   **Aerospace**: Nonmetals are used in the production of aircraft and spacecraft.\n*   **Automotive**: Nonmetals are used in the production of vehicles and vehicle components.\n*   **Construction**: Nonmetals are used in the production of building materials, including concrete and glass.\n\nTaxonomical History\n-------------------\n\n### Background\n\nThe classification of elements as metals or nonmetals has a long history, dating back to ancient times. The ancient Greeks and Romans classified elements into two categories: metals and nonmetals.\n\n### Organization of Elements by Types\n\nIn the 19th century, the periodic table was developed, which organized elements by their atomic number and chemical properties. The periodic table was divided into three categories: metals, nonmetals, and metalloids.\n\n### Development of Types\n\nThe development of the periodic table and the classification of elements as metals, nonmetals, and metalloids was a gradual process that involved the contributions of many scientists over several centuries.\n\n### Suggested Distinguishing Criteria\n\nSome suggested distinguishing criteria for classifying elements as metals or nonmetals include:\n\n*   **Electronegativity**: The ability of an element to attract electrons to itself.\n*   **Ionization energy**: The energy required to remove an electron from an atom.\n*   **Electron configuration**: The arrangement of electrons in an atom.\n*   **Physical properties**: The physical properties of an element, such as its melting and boiling points.\n\nComparison of Selected Properties\n---------------------------------\n\n### Physical Properties by Element Type\n\nThe physical properties of metals and nonmetals differ significantly. Some of the key differences include:\n\n*   **Melting point**: Metals have higher melting points than nonmetals.\n*   **Boiling point**: Metals have higher boiling points than nonmetals.\n*   **Density**: Metals are typically denser than nonmetals.\n*   **Conductivity**: Metals are good conductors of electricity and heat, while nonmetals are poor conductors.\n\n### Chemical Properties by Element Type\n\nThe chemical properties of metals and nonmetals also differ significantly. Some of the key differences include:\n\n*   **Reactivity**: Metals are more reactive than nonmetals.\n*   **Acid-base properties**: Metals can exhibit acidic or basic properties, while nonmetals can exhibit acidic or basic properties.\n*   **Multiple bond formation**: Metals can form multiple bonds with other elements, while nonmetals can form multiple bonds with other elements.\n\nSee Also\n--------\n\n*   **Periodic table**: A table that organizes elements by their atomic number and chemical properties.\n*   **Element classification**: The process of classifying elements as metals, nonmetals, or metalloids.\n*   **Metal properties**: The physical and chemical properties of metals.\n*   **Nonmetal properties**: The physical and chemical properties of nonmetals.\n\nNotes\n-----\n\n*   **Classification of elements**: The classification of elements as metals or nonmetals is a complex and multifaceted process.\n*   **Taxonomy of elements**: The taxonomy of elements is a branch of chemistry that deals with the classification of elements.\n*   **Element classification criteria**: The criteria used to classify elements as metals or nonmetals include electronegativity, ionization energy, electron configuration, and physical properties.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n*   **Citations**: (1) (2) (3) (4) (5)\n*   **Bibliography**: (1) (2) (3) (4) (5)\n\nExternal Links\n---------------\n\n*   **Periodic table**: [www.periodic-table.com](http://www.periodic-table.com)\n*   **Element classification**: [www.elementclassification.com](http://www.elementclassification.com)\n*   **Metal properties**: [www.metalproperties.com](http://www.metalproperties.com)\n*   **Nonmetal properties**: [www.nonmetalproperties.com](http://www.nonmetalproperties.com)", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The playoffs began on January 14, 2023, with the wild card round and concluded with Super Bowl LVII on February 12, 2023.\n\nParticipants\n\nThe 2022–23 NFL playoffs featured 14 teams competing in a single-elimination tournament. The participants were determined by the regular season standings, with the top seven teams from each conference earning a spot in the playoffs.\n\nUnused format changes following Week 17 canceled Bills–Bengals game\nThe NFL introduced a new format for the playoffs in 2022, featuring a 17-game regular season schedule. However, due to the canceled game between the Buffalo Bills and Cincinnati Bengals in Week 17, the playoff format was not fully implemented. The teams that would have played in the wild card round were instead seeded based on their regular season records.\n\nNew postseason overtime rule\nIn 2022, the NFL introduced a new overtime rule for the postseason. The rule states that if the score is tied at the end of regulation, the game will proceed into overtime.

In his quest to find a cure, Morbius undergoes an experimental treatment that transforms him into a vampire, granting him superhuman strength and speed.

The earthquakes caused widespread destruction, loss of life, and displacement of people, making it one of the deadliest natural disasters in recent history.\n\n**#Tectonic setting**\n\nThe earthquakes occurred in a region of high tectonic activity, where the Eurasian and Arabian tectonic plates meet. This region is prone to earthquakes due to the movement of these plates.\n\n##**Geology**\n\nThe geology of the region is characterized by a mix of sedimentary and metamorphic rocks, including limestone, sandstone, and marble. The rocks in the area have been subjected to intense tectonic activity, resulting in the formation of faults and fractures.\n\n##**Seismicity**\n\nThe region has a high seismicity, with many earthquakes occurring in the past. The earthquakes in 2023 were a result of the movement of the tectonic plates, which led to the release of stored energy in the form of seismic waves.\n\n**#Earthquake sequence**\n\nThe earthquakes occurred in a sequence, with the first earthquake striking on February 6, 2023, followed by several aftershocks.\n\n##**Aftershocks**\n\nThe aftershocks were intense and continued for several days, causing further damage and disruption to the affected areas.\n\n##**Seismology**\n\nThe earthquakes were studied by seismologists, who analyzed the data to understand the mechanism of the earthquakes and the impact on the region.\n\n##**Rupture propagation**\n\nThe rupture propagation of the earthquakes was studied to understand how the seismic waves traveled through the Earth's crust and caused damage.\n\n##**Surface rupture**\n\nThe surface rupture of the earthquakes occurred as a result of the movement of the tectonic plates, causing the ground to break and create fissures.\n\n##**Ground motion**\n\nThe ground motion caused by the earthquakes was intense, resulting in widespread damage and loss of life.\n\n##**Geological effects**\n\nThe geological effects of the earthquakes included

The film is a sequel to the 2018 film Meg, and stars Jason Statham, Li Bingbing, and Cliff Curtis. The story follows a team of scientists and deep-sea explorers as they embark on a perilous journey to the Mariana Trench, where they encounter a massive prehistoric shark, the Megalodon.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film begins with a prologue that explains the events of the first film, and introduces a new character, Jonas Taylor (Jason Statham), who is struggling to come to terms with his past experiences. Jonas is approached by a group of scientists, led by Dr. Emma Taylor (Li Bingbing), who is his estranged wife, and Dr. Jerald (Cliff Curtis), who is a marine biologist. They convince Jonas to join their expedition to the Mariana Trench, where they plan to explore the ocean floor and discover new species.\n\nAs the team descends into the depths of the ocean, they encounter a massive prehistoric shark, the Megalodon, which is awakened by the disturbance caused by the team's presence. The team soon realizes that the Megalodon is not just a mindless beast, but a highly intelligent and social creature that is capable of complex behavior.\n\nAs the team tries to escape the Megalodon's clutches, they discover that the creature is being led by a massive female Megalodon, which is the largest shark to have ever existed. The team soon realizes that the female Megalodon is not just a predator, but a mother who is trying to protect her young from the team.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Jason Statham as Jonas Taylor\n* Li Bingbing as Dr. Emma Taylor\n* Cliff Curtis as Dr. Jerald\n* Page Kennedy as DJ\n* Nelly as Suyin\n* Raymond Chen as Jian\n* Bob Bailey as Vic\n\n**Production**\n\n### Development\n\nThe development of Meg 2: The Trench began in 2019, shortly after the release of the first film. The film's screenwriter, Dean Georgaris, was approached by the film's producers, Lorenzo di Bonaventura and Jason Fuchs, to write a sequel to the film. Georgaris worked on the script for several months, developing a story that would explore the mythology of the Megalodon and introduce new characters to the franchise.\n\n### Pre-production\n\nPre-production on the film began in 2020, with the hiring of director Ben Wheatley and the assembly of the cast and crew. The film's budget was increased significantly from the first film, allowing for more elaborate sets and visual effects.\n\n### Filming\n\nFilming on the film began in 2021, with the cast and crew shooting on location in the Pacific Ocean. The film's underwater sequences were shot using a combination of practical effects and CGI.\n\n### Post-production\n\nPost-production on the film was a lengthy and involved process, with the film's editor, Chris Judge, working closely with Wheatley to shape the film's narrative and pacing. The film's visual effects were created by a team of artists at Weta Digital, who used a combination of CGI and practical effects to bring the Megalodon to life.\n\n### Music\n\nThe film's score was composed by Lorne Balfe, who used a combination of orchestral and electronic elements to create a dark and ominous sonic landscape. The film's soundtrack was released in 2023, and features a mix of electronic and rock tracks that complement the film's action-packed sequences.\n\n**Release**\n\n### Home media\n\nMeg 2: The Trench was released on DVD and Blu-ray in 2023, with a variety of special features, including deleted scenes, behind-the-scenes footage, and a making-of documentary.\n\n**Reception**\n\n### Box office\n\nMeg 2: The Trench was a commercial success, grossing over $500 million worldwide.

However, some critics felt that the film's narrative was convoluted and that the characters were underdeveloped.\n\n### Accolades\n\nMeg 2: The Trench received several awards and nominations, including a nomination for Best Visual Effects at the 2023 Visual Effects Society Awards.\n\n**Future**\n\nA third film in the Meg franchise is currently in development, with Wheatley set to return as director. The film's plot is still under wraps, but it is expected to continue the story of Jonas Taylor and his team as they face off against a new threat in the depths of the ocean.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Meg (2018 film)\n* The Megalodon\n* Ben Wheatley\n* Jason Statham\n\n**References**\n\n* None\n\n**External links**\n\n* Official website\n* Meg 2: The Trench at IMDb\n* Meg 2: The Trench at Rotten Tomatoes", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The series consists of silkscreen prints of Campbell's soup cans, which became an iconic representation of consumer culture.\n\n**New York art scene**\n\nWarhol's involvement in the New York art scene began in the late 1950s, when he moved to the city to pursue a career in commercial art. He quickly gained recognition for his work as a graphic designer and illustrator, and his reputation as a talented artist was established.\n\n**Pop art**\n\nWarhol's work in the early 1960s was deeply influenced by the emerging Pop Art movement, which celebrated the banality and ubiquity of consumer culture. Warhol's use of consumer products, such as soup cans, as subjects for his art was a key aspect of this movement. By elevating everyday objects to the status of high art, Warhol challenged traditional notions of what constitutes art and questioned the values of modern consumer society.\n\n**Premiere**\n\nThe **Campbell's Soup Cans** series premiered at the Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles in 1962. The exhibition was a major success, and the series quickly gained widespread attention and acclaim.\n\n**Subsequent publicity**\n\nThe series received significant publicity in the years following its premiere. Warhol's use of consumer products as subjects for his art sparked a national debate about the role of art in society and the values of modern consumer culture. The series was also widely reproduced in art publications and media outlets, further increasing its visibility and popularity.\n\n**Campbell's Soup Company**\n\n**Can and label history**\n\nCampbell's Soup Company was founded in 1869 by Joseph A. Campbell. The company's early success was due in part to its innovative use of canning technology, which allowed for the mass production of shelf-stable foods. The company's iconic red-and-white can design was introduced in the early 20th century, and has remained largely unchanged to this day.\n\n**Relation to Warhol's art**\n\nWarhol's use of Campbell's soup cans in his art was inspired by the ubiquity and familiarity of the product. Warhol saw the cans as a symbol of modern consumer culture, and used them as a vehicle to explore the themes of consumerism and mass production.\n\n**Inspiration**\n\nWarhol's **Campbell's Soup Cans** series was also influenced by his relationships with other artists and creatives. Warhol was friends and colleagues with artists such as Roy Lichtenstein and Jasper Johns, and was heavily influenced by their work.\n\n**Artist colleagues**\n\nWarhol's friendships and collaborations with other artists had a significant impact on his work. His relationships with artists such as Edie Sedgwick and Lou Reed, for example, helped to shape his use of celebrity culture and consumer products in his art.\n\n**Interpretation**\n\nThe **Campbell's Soup Cans** series has been interpreted in a variety of ways over the years. Some critics have seen the series as a commentary on the banality and ubiquity of consumer culture, while others have interpreted it as a celebration of American consumerism.\n\n**Variations**\n\n**Campbell's Soup I and Campbell's Soup Cans II**\n\nThe **Campbell's Soup Cans** series was initially exhibited in a grid format, with multiple prints of the same image arranged in a single row. This format was used in the series' first exhibition at the Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles.\n\n**Colored soup cans**\n\nIn addition to the original black-and-white prints, Warhol also created a series of colored soup cans, which were exhibited in the early 1960s. These prints featured the same images as the original series, but with additional colors and textures added.\n\n**Unauthorized versions**\n\nIn the years following Warhol's death, a number of unauthorized versions of the **Campbell's Soup Cans** series have been created. These prints often feature the same images as the original series, but with additional colors, textures, or other modifications.\n\n**Other variations**\n\nWarhol also experimented with other variations of the **Campbell's Soup Cans** series, including prints featuring different soup flavors and packaging designs.

These clocks are highly accurate and reliable, making them essential for modern society. Atomic clocks have revolutionized the way we keep time, enabling precise synchronization of clocks across the globe and paving the way for advanced technologies.\n\n**History**\n\n### Definition of the Second\n\nThe concept of an atomic clock began to take shape in the 1940s, when physicists first proposed using the vibrations of atoms to measure time. The definition of the second, the fundamental unit of time, has undergone several revisions since then. Initially, the second was defined as a fraction of the Earth's rotation period. However, with the advent of atomic clocks, it became possible to define the second in terms of the natural frequency of cesium-133 atoms. This definition, adopted in 1967, remains in use today.\n\n### Metrology Advancements and Optical Clocks\n\nThe development of atomic clocks has been driven by advances in metrology, the science of measurement. The invention of the maser (microwave amplification by stimulated emission of radiation) in the 1950s enabled the creation of the first atomic clocks. These early clocks used microwave radiation to excite the cesium atoms, which then emitted a signal at a precise frequency. The introduction of optical clocks in the 1990s, which use laser light to excite the atoms, has improved the accuracy of atomic clocks by several orders of magnitude.\n\n### Chip-Scale Atomic Clocks\n\nThe miniaturization of atomic clocks has led to the development of chip-scale atomic clocks (CSACs). These tiny clocks utilize a combination of microfabrication techniques and advanced materials to create a compact, high-accuracy timekeeper. CSACs have numerous applications, including synchronization of clocks in distributed systems and development of advanced navigation systems.\n\n**Measuring Time with Atomic Clocks**\n\n### Clock Mechanism\n\nAn atomic clock consists of three main components: a clock mechanism, a tuning circuit, and a reference oscillator. The clock mechanism is responsible for measuring the time difference between the reference oscillator and the atomic frequency. The tuning circuit adjusts the reference oscillator to match the atomic frequency, ensuring that the clock keeps accurate time.\n\n### Tuning and Optimization\n\nThe tuning circuit is critical in ensuring that the atomic clock operates at its optimal frequency. The circuit uses a combination of algorithms and feedback loops to adjust the reference oscillator, taking into account changes in the atomic frequency due to environmental factors such as temperature and humidity.\n\n**Accuracy**\n\nAtomic clocks are renowned for their exceptional accuracy. The most advanced clocks have an uncertainty of only one second over tens of millions of years. This precision is essential for applications such as global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) and financial transactions.\n\n**Comparing Atomic Clocks**\n\n### Time Standards\n\nAtomic clocks have revolutionized the way we keep time, enabling precise synchronization of clocks across the globe. Time standards, such as Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), rely on atomic clocks to maintain the integrity of the global timekeeping system.\n\n### Synchronization with Satellites\n\nGNSS systems, such as GPS and GLONASS, rely on atomic clocks to provide accurate time and location information. The clocks on board the satellites are synchronized with Earth-based atomic clocks, ensuring that the system operates with high precision.\n\n### International Timekeeping\n\nThe Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM), located in Sevres, France, is responsible for coordinating the world's timekeeping system. The BIPM maintains a network of atomic clocks that provide a reference time, enabling countries to synchronize their clocks with international standards.\n\n### Fiber Optics\n\nThe use of fiber optics has enabled the creation of highly accurate optical clocks. These clocks, which use laser light to excite the atoms, have improved the accuracy of timekeeping by several orders of magnitude.\n\n**Microwave Atomic Clocks**\n\n### Caesium\n\nCaesium-based atomic clocks were the first to be developed. The block diagram of a caesium clock consists of a microwave source, a frequency divider, and a phase comparator. The clock uses the natural frequency of cesium-133 atoms to regulate its timekeeping.\n\n### Rubidium\n\nRubidium-based atomic clocks were developed in the 1960s. These clocks use the natural frequency of rubidium-87 atoms to regulate their timekeeping. Rubidium clocks are less accurate than caesium clocks but are still widely used due to their lower cost and simpler design.\n\n### Hydrogen\n\nHydrogen-based atomic clocks are among the most accurate timekeepers. These clocks use the natural frequency of hydrogen-1 atoms to regulate their timekeeping.\n\n**Other Types of Atomic Clocks**\n\n### Quantum Clocks\n\nQuantum clocks utilize the principles of quantum mechanics to measure time. These clocks have the potential to revolutionize timekeeping, enabling the creation of clocks with even higher accuracy.\n\n### Nuclear Clock Concept\n\nThe nuclear clock concept involves using the decay rate of certain radioactive isotopes to measure time. This approach has the potential to create clocks with even higher accuracy than atomic clocks.\n\n**Potential for Redefining the Second**\n\nThe definition of the second is based on the natural frequency of cesium-133 atoms. However, with the advent of more accurate timekeepers, there is a growing need to redefine the second. The use of the Rydberg constant, a fundamental constant of nature, could provide a more precise basis for the second.\n\n### Rydberg Constant\n\nThe Rydberg constant is a fundamental constant of nature that describes the energy levels of atoms. It has been used to redefine the second, providing a more precise basis for timekeeping.\n\n### Requirements\n\nTo redefine the second, it is essential to develop a new time standard that is more accurate than the current one. This requires the creation of clocks with even higher accuracy, such as those based on the Rydberg constant.\n\n### Secondary Representations of the Second\n\nSecondary representations of the second, such as the definition of the second in terms of the Rydberg constant, are essential for maintaining the integrity of the global timekeeping system.\n\n**Applications**\n\n### Global Navigation Satellite Systems\n\nGNSS systems, such as GPS and GLONASS, rely on atomic clocks to provide accurate time and location information. The clocks on board the satellites are synchronized with Earth-based atomic clocks, ensuring that the system operates with high precision.\n\n### Experimental Space Clock\n\nThe development of an experimental space clock has the potential to revolutionize timekeeping, enabling the creation of clocks with even higher accuracy.\n\n### Military Usage\n\nAtomic clocks have numerous military applications, including synchronization of clocks in distributed systems and development of advanced navigation systems.\n\n### Time Signal Radio Transmitters\n\nTime signal radio transmitters use atomic clocks to provide accurate time signals to the public. These signals are essential for maintaining the integrity of the global timekeeping system.\n\n### General Relativity\n\nAtomic clocks have played a crucial role in testing the theory of general relativity. The clocks have been used to measure the effects of gravity on time, providing insights into the nature of spacetime.\n\n### Financial Systems\n\nAtomic clocks are used in financial systems to synchronize clocks and provide accurate time stamps. This is essential for ensuring the integrity of financial transactions.\n\n### Transportable Optical Clocks\n\nThe development of transportable optical clocks has the potential to revolutionize timekeeping, enabling the creation of clocks with even higher accuracy.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Clock\n* Timekeeping\n* Metrology\n* Physics\n* Engineering\n\n**Explanatory Notes**\n\n* This article has provided an overview of atomic clocks, their history, and their applications.\n* The development of atomic clocks has revolutionized timekeeping, enabling the creation of clocks with even higher accuracy.\n* The use of atomic clocks has numerous applications, including synchronization of clocks in distributed systems and development of advanced navigation systems.\n* The definition of the second is based on the natural frequency of cesium-133 atoms.\n* The Rydberg constant has been used to redefine the second, providing a more precise basis for timekeeping.\n* The development of transportable optical clocks has the potential to revolutionize timekeeping, enabling the creation of clocks with even higher accuracy.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

Born on September 29, 1935, in Ferriday, Louisiana, Lewis has had a storied career spanning over six decades, marked by both triumphs and controversies.\n\n**Early life**\n\nJerry Lee Lewis was born to Emlie and Elmo Lewis, a family of modest means. He was the youngest of the seven children, and his early life was marked by poverty and hardship. Lewis's mother, Emlie, was a devout Pentecostal Christian, and the family attended church regularly. Lewis's early exposure to gospel music had a profound impact on his future career.\n\n**Career**\n\n### **J&M Studio**\n\nLewis's music career began at the age of 15, when he started playing piano at the local J&M Studio in Ferriday. The studio, owned by brothers J.W. and Marion Malcom, became a hub for local musicians, and Lewis would often jam with other artists, including Elvis Presley. It was at J&M Studio that Lewis honed his skills and developed his unique piano style.\n\n### **Sun Records**\n\nIn 1956, Lewis traveled to Memphis, Tennessee, to audition for Sam Phillips at Sun Records. Phillips, the founder of Sun Records, was impressed by Lewis's raw talent and energy. Lewis's first single, \"End of the Road,\" was released in November 1956, but it was his second single, \"Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On,\" that brought him national attention.\n\n### **Marriage controversy**\n\nLewis's marriage to his 13-year-old cousin, Myra Gale Brown, in 1957, sparked a scandal that would damage his career. The marriage, which was later annulled, led to a backlash from fans, critics, and the media. Lewis's record sales plummeted, and he was dropped by his record label, Sun Records.\n\n### **Smash Records**\n\nIn 1962, Lewis signed with Smash Records, a label owned by Mercury Records. This marked a new chapter in Lewis's career, as he began to explore other genres, including country and gospel. Lewis's music continued to evolve, and he released several successful albums, including \"Jerry Lee Lewis\" and \"Soul Meets Country.\"\n\n### **Live at the Star Club, Hamburg**\n\nIn 1964, Lewis traveled to Hamburg, Germany, where he performed at the iconic Star Club. The live album, \"Live at the Star Club, Hamburg,\" was released in 1964 and showcased Lewis's energetic stage presence. The album was a critical and commercial success, and it helped to revitalize Lewis's career.\n\n### **Country comeback**\n\nIn the 1970s, Lewis began to focus more on country music, releasing several successful albums, including \"Country Memories\" and \"Another Place Another Time.\" Lewis's country albums were well-received by critics and fans, and he became a staple on the country music scene.\n\n### **Grand Ole Opry appearance**\n\nIn 1980, Lewis made his debut appearance on the Grand Ole Opry, a prestigious country music institution. Lewis's performance was met with a standing ovation, and he became the first rock and roll artist to be inducted into the Opry.\n\n### **The Session and Southern Roots**\n\nIn 1995, Lewis released the album \"The Session,\" a collection of gospel and country songs. The album was well-received by critics, and it showcased Lewis's continued musical evolution. Lewis's roots in the American South were also explored in the album \"Southern Roots,\" released in 1998.\n\n### **Later career**\n\nIn the 2000s, Lewis continued to tour and record music.

After leaving the military, he transitioned into a corporate career, becoming a successful businessman. However, his reputation has been marred by allegations of war crimes, which have led to a defamation suit and subsequent controversy.\n\nEarly life and family\n\nBen Roberts-Smith was born on October 1, 1978, in Sydney, Australia. His early life and family background have been the subject of limited public scrutiny, with reports suggesting that he grew up in a conservative and traditional household. Little is known about his childhood or his relationship with his family members. Roberts-Smith has not publicly discussed his personal life or family dynamics, preferring to maintain a low profile outside of his military and professional pursuits.\n\nMilitary career\n\nBen Roberts-Smith enlisted in the Australian Army in 1998, at the age of 20. He quickly distinguished himself as a capable and dedicated soldier, attending the Royal Military College, Duntroon, and graduating in 2001 as a lieutenant. Roberts-Smith went on to serve in a variety of roles, including as a platoon commander in the SASR, where he participated in several high-profile missions, including the 2002 Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan.\n\nMilitary decorations\n\nThroughout his military career, Ben Roberts-Smith was awarded numerous decorations and commendations for his bravery and service. These include:\n\n* Medal for Gallantry (MG)\n* Star of Gallantry (SG)\n* Conspicuous Service Medal (CSM)\n* Australian Active Service Medal (AASM)\n* Afghanistan Medal (AM)\n* Australian Service Medal (ASM)\n\nRoberts-Smith's decorations reflect his participation in several high-risk operations, including the Battle of Tizak, where he led his team in a fierce firefight against Taliban forces. His military service was marked by a strong sense of duty and a willingness to take risks, earning him the respect of his peers and superiors.\n\nCorporate career\n\nAfter leaving the military in 2013, Ben Roberts-Smith transitioned into a corporate career, becoming a successful businessman and entrepreneur. He has held various executive positions, including as the chief executive officer of Slater and Gordon's real estate division.

The allegations, which were made by several former SASR soldiers, included claims that Roberts-Smith had killed Taliban fighters and civilians in cold blood. The allegations were initially denied by Roberts-Smith, who described them as \"baseless\" and \"false.\"\n\nInvestigation\n\nThe allegations against Roberts-Smith were investigated by the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and the Australian Defence Force (ADF). The investigation, which was carried out in conjunction with the Office of the Special Investigator (OSI), found that some of the allegations against Roberts-Smith had merit, but that there was insufficient evidence to prove that he had committed any war crimes.\n\nDefamation suit\n\nIn 2020, Ben Roberts-Smith launched a defamation suit against the Australian media outlet, The Age, and its journalist, Nick McKenzie, who had published an article alleging that Roberts-Smith had committed war crimes. The suit, which was filed in the Federal Court of Australia, claimed that the article had damaged Roberts-Smith's reputation and caused him financial loss.\n\nJudgment\n\nIn 2022, the Federal Court of Australia delivered a judgment in the defamation suit, finding that some of the statements made by The Age and its journalist were defamatory, but that others were not. The court also found that some of the statements were not defamatory, but that they had still caused harm to Roberts-Smith's reputation.\n\nAppeal\n\nThe parties involved in the defamation suit have appealed the judgment, with The Age and its journalist arguing that the court's findings were incorrect and that the statements made about Roberts-Smith were not defamatory. The appeal is ongoing.\n\nFurther controversy\n\nThe war crime allegations against Ben Roberts-Smith have continued to generate controversy, with some critics accusing him of being a \"war criminal\" and others defending him as a \"hero.\" The allegations have also raised questions about the conduct of Australian soldiers during the war in Afghanistan and the need for greater accountability and transparency.\n\nPersonal life\n\nBen Roberts-Smith is married to a woman named Belinda, and they have two children together. He is known to be a private person and keeps his personal life out of the public eye. Roberts-Smith has stated that he is committed to his family and values his relationships with them above all else.\n\nReferences\n\nThis article uses only publicly available information and does not include any citations or references.\n\nExternal links\n\n* Ben Roberts-Smith's LinkedIn profile\n* Australian War Memorial Foundation\n* SASR's fundraising campaign for wounded veterans\n* The Age's article on Ben Roberts-Smith's war crime allegations\n* Federal Court of Australia's judgment in the defamation suit", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The album marked SZA's major-label debut and received widespread critical acclaim for its introspective and emotionally charged songwriting.\n\n**Background**\n\nSZA's interest in music began at a young age, with her mother introducing her to various genres, including R&B, soul, and jazz. She began writing her own songs and performing in local talent shows, eventually releasing her debut mixtape, See.SZA.Run, in 2012. This was followed by two more mixtapes, S and Z, which garnered attention from record labels.\n\nIn 2017, SZA released her debut studio album, Ctrl, to critical acclaim and commercial success. The album earned her four Grammy nominations, including Best New Artist, and solidified her position as a rising star in the music industry. Following the release of Ctrl, SZA took a hiatus from music, during which she focused on songwriting and production.\n\n**Writing and production**\n\nThe writing and production process for SOS took place over the course of several years, with SZA working with a variety of collaborators, including producers Dot Da Genius, Jacob Collier, and Carter Lang. SZA has stated that the album was inspired by her experiences with love, heartbreak, and self-discovery, as well as her observations of the world around her.\n\nIn an interview with Rolling Stone, SZA explained that the album's themes of introspection and emotional vulnerability were influenced by her own experiences with anxiety and depression. She also stated that she aimed to create an album that would appeal to a wide range of listeners, incorporating elements of R&B, pop, and electronic music.\n\n**Composition**\n\nThe album's composition is characterized by SZA's introspective and emotionally charged songwriting, as well as her incorporation of various musical styles and influences. The album features a range of tempos and dynamics, from the slow and introspective \"Kill Bill\" to the upbeat and dance-oriented \"Gone Girl.\"\n\nThe album's production is marked by its use of atmospheric synthesizers, minimalist drum patterns, and intricate vocal arrangements. SZA's vocal delivery is characterized by her distinctive, soulful tone and her ability to convey a range of emotions through her lyrics and melody.\n\n**Title and artwork**\n\nThe title of the album, SOS, is a reference to the song \"SOS\" by ABBA, which SZA has stated is one of her favorite songs of all time.
