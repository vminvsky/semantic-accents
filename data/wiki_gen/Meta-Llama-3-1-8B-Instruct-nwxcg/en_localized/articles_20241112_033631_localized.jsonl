It emphasizes the use of intuitionistic logic, which is a non-classical logic that rejects the law of excluded middle. Constructive set theory has its roots in the work of mathematicians such as L.E.J. Brouwer and Stephen Kleene, who developed the theory in the early 20th century. The theory has since been developed and refined by many other mathematicians, and today it is a thriving area of research in mathematics.\n\n**Constructive Outlook**\n\n### Preliminary on the use of intuitionistic logic\n\nIntuitionistic logic is a non-classical logic that rejects the law of excluded middle, which states that a statement is either true or false. In intuitionistic logic, a statement is considered to be true only if it can be constructed or proven, and false if it can be shown to be impossible. This approach to logic is in contrast to classical logic, which assumes that a statement is either true or false, regardless of whether it can be proven or not. Intuitionistic logic is used in constructive set theory because it provides a way to avoid the use of non-constructive principles, such as the axiom of choice.\n\n### Imposed restrictions on a set theory\n\nConstructive set theory imposes certain restrictions on the set theory, such as the requirement that all sets must be defined in a constructive way. This means that all sets must be defined using a finite number of steps, and that all properties of the sets must be constructively defined. This approach to set theory is in contrast to classical set theory, which allows for the use of non-constructive principles, such as the axiom of choice.\n\n### Metalogic\n\nMetalogic is the study of the logical properties of a set theory. In constructive set theory, metalogic is used to study the properties of the constructive logic used in the theory. Metalogic provides a way to analyze and understand the logical structure of the theory, and to identify any contradictions or inconsistencies.\n\n### Anti-classical principles\n\nAnti-classical principles are principles that reject the use of classical logic. In constructive set theory, anti-classical principles are used to avoid the use of non-constructive principles, such as the axiom of choice. Anti-classical principles are used to provide a constructive alternative to classical logic, and to ensure that the set theory is consistent and free from contradictions.\n\n**History and Overview**\n\n### Models\n\nModels of constructive set theory are mathematical structures that satisfy the axioms of the theory. There are many different models of constructive set theory, each with its own set of axioms and properties. Some of the most well-known models of constructive set theory include the constructive Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, the intuitionistic Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, and the Bishop-style set theory.\n\n**Notation**\n\n### Language\n\nThe language of constructive set theory is a formal language that is used to express the axioms and theorems of the theory.

The type of equipment used depends on the specific climbing discipline, terrain, and personal preference. This article provides an overview of the various types of rock-climbing equipment, including ropes, slings, rope connectors, rope devices, protection devices, aid equipment, clothing, and miscellaneous equipment.\n\n# Use and certification\n\n## Type of climbing\n\nDifferent types of climbing require different types of equipment. Top-rope climbing, for example, typically involves using a rope that is anchored at the top of the climb, while lead climbing requires the use of a rope that is clipped into place as the climber ascends. Bouldering, which involves short, lower-level climbs, often requires the use of crash pads and climbing shoes with a sticky sole.\n\n## Certification\n\nRock-climbing equipment must meet specific safety standards and certifications, such as those set by the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). These standards outline requirements for materials, construction, and performance, ensuring that equipment provides adequate protection for climbers.\n\n# Ropes and slings\n\n## Ropes\n\nRopes are the primary means of connecting climbers to the climbing surface. Climbing ropes are typically made from nylon or a nylon-polyester blend and are designed to withstand forces of up to 25 kN (5,600 lbf). Ropes come in a range of diameters, lengths, and weights, with the most common being 10mm (3/8 inch) and 11mm (7/16 inch). Climbing ropes are often treated with a waterproof coating and may feature additional features such as a dynamic rope or a self-rescue rope.\n\n## Slings\n\nSlings are loops of webbing or rope that are used to create a temporary anchor point. They are often used in conjunction with carabiners to connect to the climbing surface or other anchors. Slings can be made from a range of materials, including nylon, polyester, or Kevlar, and come in different diameters and lengths.\n\n## Cords\n\nCords are thin, lightweight ropes used for a variety of purposes, including as a climbing aid or for securing equipment. They are often made from nylon or polyester and may feature a braided or twisted construction.\n\n# Rope connectors\n\n## Carabiners\n\nCarabiners are metal clips used to connect a rope or sling to an anchor point or other piece of equipment. They are designed to withstand forces of up to 20 kN (4,500 lbf) and come in a range of shapes and sizes, including oval, D-shaped, and pear-shaped carabiners.\n\n## Harnesses\n\nHarnesses are wearable devices used to connect a climber to a rope or other piece of equipment. They typically consist of a waistbelt and leg loops, with the waistbelt featuring a metal or plastic buckle.\n\n## Lanyards\n\nLanyards are short lengths of rope or webbing used to create a temporary anchor point or to connect a climber to a rope. They are often used in conjunction with carabiners to connect to the climbing surface or other anchors.\n\n### Personal anchor systems\n\nA personal anchor system (PAS) is a combination of equipment, including a harness, lanyard, and carabiner, designed to provide a secure connection between a climber and the climbing surface. PAS systems are typically used for canyoneering and other types of multi-pitch climbing.\n\n## Quickdraws\n\nQuickdraws are specialized carabiners with a rope clip attached to the end. They are used to connect a rope to a bolt or other anchor point, with the rope clip allowing the rope to pass through the carabiner.\n\n# Rope devices\n\n## Ascenders\n\nAscenders are devices that allow a climber to ascend a rope without the need for a separate ascender device. They are typically used for rescue or emergency climbing situations.\n\n## Belay devices\n\nBelay devices are used to control the rope during a climb, allowing the belayer to catch a falling climber. They come in a range of styles, including manual, assisted-braking, and automatic devices.\n\n## Descenders\n\nDescenders are devices used to control the descent of a climber down a rope. They are typically used for rescue or emergency climbing situations.\n\n## Self-locking devices\n\nSelf-locking devices are used to prevent a rope from moving or unclipping from an anchor point. They are often used in conjunction with carabiners to ensure a secure connection.\n\n# Protection devices\n\n## Temporary\n\nTemporary protection devices are used to create a temporary anchor point or to provide additional protection for a climber. They are often used in conjunction with carabiners to connect to the climbing surface or other anchors.\n\n### Active\n\nActive protection devices are used to actively engage with the climbing surface, such as a cam or nut. They are designed to provide a secure connection and are often used in conjunction with carabiners.\n\n### Passive\n\nPassive protection devices are used to provide additional protection for a climber without actively engaging with the climbing surface. They are often used in conjunction with carabiners to connect to the climbing surface or other anchors.\n\n## Fixed\n\nFixed protection devices are used to create a permanent anchor point or to provide additional protection for a climber. They are often used in conjunction with carabiners to connect to the climbing surface or other anchors.\n\n# Aid equipment\n\nAid equipment is used to assist a climber in ascending a route, often using specialized devices such as ropes, ladders, and pulleys. Aid climbing is typically used for longer, more difficult climbs.\n\n# Clothing equipment\n\nClothing equipment is used to provide protection, support, and comfort for the climber. This includes climbing shoes, gloves, helmets, and clothing designed to wick moisture and provide insulation.\n\n# Miscellaneous equipment\n\nMiscellaneous equipment includes items such as first aid kits, headlamps, and communication devices. These items are used to ensure the climber's safety and comfort during the climb.\n\n# Training equipment\n\nTraining equipment is used to teach climbers new skills and techniques. This includes items such as climbing walls, artificial climbing surfaces, and instructional devices.\n\n# See also\n\n## Manufacturers\n\n* Black Diamond Equipment\n* Petzl\n* CAMP USA\n* Arc'teryx\n* Mammut\n\n## Types\n\n* Climbing ropes\n* Climbing harnesses\n* Climbing shoes\n* Belay devices\n* Carabiners\n* Quickdraws\n* Ascenders\n* Descenders\n* Protection devices\n* Aid equipment\n* Clothing equipment\n* Miscellaneous equipment\n\n# References\n\nFor further reading, see:\n\n* \"Climbing: Personal and Professional Development\" by the American Mountain Guides Association\n* \"The Climbing Bible\" by the Mountaineers Books\n* \"Rock Climbing: Methods and Principles\" by the International Federation of Mountain Guides Associations\n\n# External links\n\n* International Federation of Mountain Guides Associations\n* American Mountain Guides Association\n* Climbing Magazine\n* The Climbing Academy\n* Mountain Rescue Association", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

It is a common and usually harmless condition, but it can be a source of concern for parents and caregivers.\n\n**Signs and Symptoms**\n\nA febrile seizure is characterized by a sudden onset of convulsions or shaking, usually accompanied by fever. The seizure can take various forms, including:\n\n### Types\n\nThere are several types of febrile seizures, including:\n\n* **Simple febrile seizures**: These are the most common type and are characterized by a brief seizure lasting less than 15 minutes, without any underlying neurological disorder.\n* **Complex febrile seizures**: These seizures are longer than 15 minutes, or recur within 24 hours, and may be associated with an underlying neurological disorder.\n* **Focal febrile seizures**: These seizures are confined to one part of the body, such as the arm or leg, and may be associated with an underlying neurological disorder.\n* **Febrile status epilepticus**: This is a prolonged seizure that lasts more than 30 minutes and requires emergency medical attention.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe exact cause of febrile seizures is not known, but several factors are thought to contribute to their occurrence, including:\n\n* **Fever**: A rapid increase in body temperature can trigger a febrile seizure.\n* **Genetics**: Children with a family history of febrile seizures are more likely to experience one.\n* **Infections**: Certain infections, such as ear infections or urinary tract infections, can cause febrile seizures.\n* **Other medical conditions**: Certain medical conditions, such as meningitis or encephalitis, can increase the risk of febrile seizures.\n\n**Mechanism**\n\nThe exact mechanism of febrile seizures is not fully understood, but it is thought to involve a combination of factors, including:\n\n* **Cerebral blood flow**: A rapid increase in body temperature can cause changes in cerebral blood flow, leading to a febrile seizure.\n* **Neurotransmitters**: Changes in the levels of certain neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and dopamine, may also contribute to the development of a febrile seizure.\n* **Electrical activity**: Alterations in electrical activity in the brain may also play a role in the development of a febrile seizure.\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiagnosing a febrile seizure typically involves a physical examination and a review of the child's medical history. The diagnosis is usually based on the presence of a fever and a seizure, and may be confirmed by a variety of tests, including:\n\n* **EEG**: An electroencephalogram (EEG) may be performed to rule out other neurological disorders.\n* **Blood tests**: Blood tests may be performed to rule out underlying infections or medical conditions.\n* **Imaging studies**: Imaging studies, such as a CT or MRI scan, may be performed to rule out underlying neurological disorders.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nWhile there is no surefire way to prevent febrile seizures, several steps can be taken to reduce the risk, including:\n\n* **Monitoring body temperature**: Keeping a close eye on body temperature to catch any rapid increases.\n* **Using cool compresses**: Applying cool compresses to the forehead, neck, and other areas to help reduce body temperature.\n* **Avoiding over-dressing**: Dressing children in layers to allow for easy removal of clothing if they become too hot.\n* **Keeping children hydrated**: Encouraging children to drink plenty of fluids to help regulate body temperature.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment for febrile seizures typically involves controlling the fever and monitoring the child's condition. The following steps may be taken:\n\n* **Fever reduction**: Medications, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, may be given to reduce fever.\n* **Seizure control**: Medications, such as diazepam or lorazepam, may be given to control seizures.\n* **Monitoring**: The child's condition is closely monitored to ensure that the seizure does not recur.\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for children who experience febrile seizures is generally good. Most children recover fully from the seizure and do not experience any long-term effects. However, some children may be at increased risk for developing other neurological disorders, such as epilepsy or autism.\n\n**Epidemiology**\n\nFebrile seizures are a common condition, affecting approximately 3-5% of children in the United States. They are more common in boys than girls, and tend to occur more frequently in children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years. The risk of febrile seizures is higher in children with a family history of the condition.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

He made significant contributions to various fields, including philosophy of mind, metaphysics, epistemology, aesthetics, and the philosophy of history.\n\n**Life**\n\n### Formative years (1770–1800)\n\nHegel was born in Stuttgart, Kingdom of Württemberg, to Georg Ludwig Friedrich Hegel, a civil servant, and Maria Magdalena Louisa Fromm. He was the third of six children. Hegel's family was of modest means, and his father's position in the government provided a relatively stable and secure environment for the family. In 1773, Hegel's family moved to Bern, where his father took a position in the chancellery. However, due to his father's poor health, the family returned to Stuttgart in 1783. Hegel's early education took place at the Lutherschule in Stuttgart, where he excelled in his studies.\n\nIn 1788, Hegel enrolled in the University of Tübingen, where he studied theology and philosophy.

He is often referred to as the \"Father of the Constitution\" for his role in drafting and promoting the United States Constitution. Madison was a key figure in the early history of the United States, playing a leading role in the drafting and ratification of the Constitution, as well as in the establishment of the Democratic-Republican Party.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n---------------------------\n\nJames Madison was born on March 16, 1751, at Port Conway, the plantation of his family in Virginia. He was the eldest of twelve children born to Colonel James Madison Sr. and Nelly Conway Madison. Madison's family was of English and Scottish descent, and his father was a wealthy planter and a prominent figure in the community. Madison's early education took place at home, where he was tutored by his mother and later attended a local school in Orange County.\n\nIn 1769, Madison entered the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University), where he studied under the tutelage of Rev. John Witherspoon, a prominent Presbyterian minister. Madison graduated in 1771 and returned to Virginia to study law under Thomas Jefferson. However, he never practiced law and instead devoted himself to politics and public service.\n\n**American Revolution and Articles of Confederation**\n------------------------------------------------\n\nMadison's entry into politics began in 1774, when he attended the Virginia Convention, which called for a boycott of British goods in response to the Intolerable Acts. He was a strong advocate for American independence from Britain and played a leading role in the Virginia delegation to the Continental Congress. In 1776, Madison drafted the Resolution of Independence, which declared the colonies' independence from Great Britain.\n\nDuring the American Revolution, Madison served in the Continental Army and was a member of the Virginia House of Delegates. He was a strong supporter of the Articles of Confederation, which were adopted in 1781. However, he was also critical of the Articles' weaknesses and limitations, which he believed hindered the newly independent nation's ability to govern effectively.\n\n**Ratification of the Constitution**\n---------------------------------\n\nIn 1787, Madison attended the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, where he played a leading role in drafting the United States Constitution. Along with Alexander Hamilton and Benjamin Franklin, Madison was one of the key figures in securing the ratification of the Constitution. He was a strong advocate for a strong central government and the principles of federalism, which he believed were essential for the nation's prosperity and security.\n\nMadison's \"Virginia Plan\" proposed a bicameral legislature with equal representation in the Senate and proportional representation in the House of Representatives. He also advocated for the protection of individual rights and liberties through a bill of rights, which was later incorporated into the Constitution.\n\n**Congressman and Party Leader (1789–1801)**\n-----------------------------------------\n\nIn 1789, Madison was elected to the United States House of Representatives, where he served for 12 consecutive terms. He was a leader of the Democratic-Republican Party, which was formed in opposition to the Federalist Party led by Alexander Hamilton. Madison's party advocated for states' rights, limited government, and individual liberties.\n\n**Election to Congress**\n\nMadison was first elected to Congress in 1789, representing the state of Virginia. He served in the House of Representatives for 12 consecutive terms, from 1789 to 1801.\n\n**Bill of Rights**\n\nMadison was a strong advocate for a bill of rights, which he believed was essential for protecting individual liberties and freedoms. In 1789, he introduced a resolution in the House of Representatives calling for a bill of rights to be added to the Constitution. The resolution was adopted, and a bill of rights was eventually incorporated into the Constitution in 1791.\n\n**Founding the Democratic–Republican Party**\n\nIn 1792, Madison helped to found the Democratic-Republican Party, which was formed in opposition to the Federalist Party. The party advocated for states' rights, limited government, and individual liberties.\n\n**Marriage and Family**\n\nIn 1794, Madison married Dolley Payne Todd, a widow with a young son. The couple had no children of their own, but they raised Dolley's son, John Payne Todd.\n\n**Adams Presidency**\n\nDuring the presidency of John Adams, Madison was a vocal critic of the administration's policies, particularly its Alien and Sedition Acts, which he believed were unconstitutional and infringed on individual liberties.\n\n**Secretary of State (1801–1809)**\n-------------------------------\n\nIn 1801, Madison was appointed Secretary of State by President Thomas Jefferson. During his tenure in this office, he played a key role in negotiating the Louisiana Purchase, which doubled the size of the United States.\n\n**1808 Presidential Election**\n\nIn 1808, Madison was nominated for president by the Democratic-Republican Party. He ran against Charles C. Pinckney, a Federalist candidate, and won the election by a landslide.\n\n**Presidency (1809–1817)**\n-------------------------\n\nMadison's presidency was marked by several significant events, including the War of 1812 and the decline of the Federalist Party.\n\n**Inauguration and Cabinet**\n\nMadison was inaugurated as president on March 4, 1809. His cabinet included George Clinton as Vice President, James Monroe as Secretary of State, Robert Smith as Secretary of the Treasury, Paul Hamilton as Secretary of the Navy, and William Eustis as Secretary of War.\n\n**War of 1812**\n\nThe War of 1812 was fought between the United States and the British Empire from 1812 to 1815. The war was sparked by British impressment of American sailors, trade restrictions, and British support for Native American resistance against American expansion.\n\n### Prelude to War\n\nIn 1811, Madison signed a declaration of war against the Shawnee leader Tecumseh and his brother, the Prophet, who were resisting American expansion in the Northwest Territory. The declaration of war was a precursor to the larger conflict with Britain.\n\n### Military Actions\n\nDuring the War of 1812, Madison's military strategy was marked by several key battles, including the Battle of Lake Erie, the Battle of the Thames, and the Battle of New Orleans. The war ended with the signing of the Treaty of Ghent on December 24, 1814.\n\n**Postwar Period and Decline of the Federalist Opposition**\n\nAfter the War of 1812, the Federalist Party began to decline, and the Democratic-Republican Party became the dominant party in American politics.\n\n**Native American Policy**\n\nDuring Madison's presidency, the United States government pursued a policy of forced relocation and assimilation of Native American tribes. This policy led to the Trail of Tears, a brutal and devastating forced relocation of the Cherokee Nation.\n\n**Election of 1816**\n\nIn 1816, Madison was re-elected for a second term as president, defeating the Federalist candidate, Rufus King.\n\n**Post-Presidency (1817–1836)**\n---------------------------\n\nAfter leaving office, Madison returned to Montpelier, his estate in Virginia. He died on June 28, 1836, at the age of 85.\n\n**Death**\n\nMadison died at his estate, Montpelier, on June 28, 1836, at the age of 85. He was buried on the estate, where his wife, Dolley, was later buried.\n\n**Political and Religious Views**\n-------------------------------\n\nMadison was a strong advocate for federalism, which he believed was essential for the nation's prosperity and security. He also believed in the importance of individual liberties and freedoms, which he believed were essential for a democratic society.\n\n**Federalism**\n\nMadison's views on federalism were shaped by his experience in the Constitutional Convention and his role in drafting the United States Constitution. He believed that a strong central government was necessary for the nation's prosperity and security, but he also believed that the states should have significant powers and autonomy.\n\n**Religion**\n\nMadison was a Presbyterian and believed in the importance of religion in public life. However, he also believed in the separation of church and state, which he believed was essential for a democratic society.\n\n**Slavery**\n\nMadison owned slaves throughout his life, despite his professed opposition to the institution of slavery. His views on slavery were complex and nuanced, and he believed that it was a necessary evil for the economy of the South.\n\n**Legacy**\n----------\n\nMadison's legacy is complex and multifaceted. He is remembered as a key figure in the early history of the United States, who played a leading role in drafting and promoting the United States Constitution. He is also remembered as a strong advocate for individual liberties and freedoms, who believed that a democratic society required a strong central government and a system of checks and balances.\n\nHowever, Madison's legacy is also marked by controversy and criticism. He is remembered as a slave owner, who participated in the institution of slavery throughout his life. He is also remembered as a leader who presided over the War of 1812, which was a devastating and costly conflict that had significant consequences for the nation.\n\nOverall, Madison's legacy is a complex and nuanced one, which reflects the many contradictions and complexities of his life and career.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

Born in Vienna, Austria, Webern was a prominent member of the Second Viennese School, alongside Arnold Schoenberg and Alban Berg. Throughout his life, Webern struggled with the challenges of living in a rapidly changing world, from the tumultuous years of World War I to the rise of National Socialism in 1930s Austria. Despite these difficulties, Webern continued to compose music, eventually emerging as a master of atonal and serialist techniques.\n\n**Biography**\n\n### 1883–1908: Upbringing between late Imperial Vienna and countryside\n\nWebern was born on December 3, 1883, in Vienna, Austria, to a family of modest means. His father, Anton Webern Sr., was a salesman, and his mother, Marie Gleissner, was a homemaker. The family lived in a small apartment in the Leopoldstadt district of Vienna, where Webern's early life was marked by a love of music. Webern's father was a music lover and exposed his children to a wide range of classical music, including the works of Mozart, Beethoven, and Brahms.\n\n**Bucolic Heimat**\n\nAs a child, Webern spent much of his summer vacations on his family's small farm in the countryside, near the town of Mödling, just outside of Vienna. This experience would later influence his music, as he often drew upon the natural world for inspiration. In his later years, Webern would refer to the Austrian countryside as his \"Heimat\" (homeland), and it remained a source of comfort and inspiration throughout his life.\n\n**University**\n\nWebern attended the University of Vienna, where he studied law and philosophy. During this period, he became increasingly interested in music, and began taking private lessons with Arnold Schoenberg, a young composer who would later become a close friend and mentor. Schoenberg's influence on Webern was profound, and would shape his musical style for years to come.\n\n**Schoenberg and his circle**\n\nWebern's relationship with Schoenberg was central to his development as a composer. Schoenberg's circle of friends and acquaintances included other prominent musicians, such as Alban Berg and Erwin Schulhoff. Together, they formed a tight-knit community of artists who shared a passion for modern music. This group would later become known as the Second Viennese School, and would play a significant role in shaping the course of 20th-century classical music.\n\n**1908–1918: Early adulthood in Austria-Hungary and German Empire**\n\n### Marriage\n\nIn 1908, Webern married Helene Gertrude Porges, a piano student of Arnold Schoenberg. The couple had two children, Maria and Anton Jr. Webern's marriage was a happy one, and his wife became a supportive partner in his musical endeavors.\n\n### Early conducting career\n\nWebern began his conducting career in the early 1910s, performing with various ensembles and orchestras in Vienna. He quickly established himself as a talented conductor, known for his sensitive interpretations of modern music.\n\n### Psychotherapy\n\nIn the early 1910s, Webern began undergoing psychotherapy with the Austrian psychoanalyst, Viktor Frankl's predecessor E. Hitschmann. Webern's therapy sessions focused on his anxiety and depression, which had become increasingly debilitating in recent years.\n\n### \"Old song\" of \"lost paradise\"\n\nWebern's music from this period, such as his String Quartet, Op. 7, No. 1, reflects a sense of longing and nostalgia. He often referred to these works as his \"old song,\" a musical expression of a lost paradise.\n\n### World War I\n\nThe outbreak of World War I had a profound impact on Webern and his family. His wife and children were forced to flee Vienna, and Webern himself was called to serve in the Austro-Hungarian army. Despite the chaos and destruction of war, Webern continued to compose music, producing some of his most innovative and expressive works.\n\n### Austrian defeat and socioeconomic strain\n\nAs the war drew to a close, Austria-Hungary suffered a crushing defeat, and the country was plunged into economic and social chaos. Webern's family struggled to make ends meet, and he himself faced significant financial difficulties.\n\n**1918–1933: Rise in Rotes Wien (Interwar Vienna)**\n\n### Society for Private Musical Performances\n\nIn 1921, Webern co-founded the Society for Private Musical Performances, a group dedicated to promoting modern music through private performances. This organization would become a vital part of Vienna's musical scene, and a platform for Webern's own music.\n\n### Mature conducting career\n\nWebern's conducting career continued to flourish in the interwar period, with performances in Vienna and beyond. He became known for his bold and innovative interpretations of modern music.\n\n### Relative success in a destabilizing society\n\nDespite the economic and social upheaval of the 1920s and 1930s, Webern's music found a small but dedicated audience. He continued to compose, producing some of his most important works, including his String Quartet, Op. 28, No. 2.\n\n**1933–1938: Perseverance in Schwarzes Wien (Austrofascist Vienna)**\n\n### Marginalization at home\n\nAs the Nazi party rose to power in Germany, Austria itself was increasingly under fascist control. Webern's music, which had once been seen as radical and innovative, was now deemed \"degenerate\" and marginalized. He faced significant challenges in his conducting career, and his music was largely ignored by the Austrofascist regime.\n\n### Besieged milieu and political confusion\n\nWebern's world was increasingly isolated, as his friends and acquaintances were either forced to flee or were persecuted by the authorities. The composer himself was beset by anxiety and depression, as he struggled to cope with the rapidly changing world around him.\n\n### Visiting conducting career\n\nWebern continued to conduct, albeit with decreasing frequency, as he traveled to various parts of Europe, performing in cities such as Berlin, Paris, and London.\n\n**1938–1939: Inner emigration in Nazi Germany**\n\n### Anschluss\n\nThe annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany in 1938, known as the Anschluss, had a devastating impact on Webern's life. His music was deemed \"degenerate\" and he was forced to flee his homeland.\n\n### Kristallnacht and recoil\n\nThe Night of Broken Glass, or Kristallnacht, in November 1938, saw widespread anti-Semitic violence and destruction in Germany and Austria. Webern's family was forced to flee, and he himself was left reeling from the trauma.\n\n**1939–1945: Hope and disillusionment during World War II**\n\n### Swiss and Reich prospects\n\nWebern hoped to escape the Nazi regime by fleeing to Switzerland or the occupied Reich. However, his plans were repeatedly thwarted, and he was forced to remain in Austria.\n\n### Wartime hopes and reality\n\nAs World War II raged on, Webern's hopes for escape seemed increasingly distant. He continued to compose music, producing some of his most important works, including his String Quartet, Op. 28, No. 3.\n\n### Refuge and death in Mittersill\n\nIn the final years of the war, Webern found refuge in Mittersill, a small village in the Austrian Alps.

The song was a commercial success, reaching number three on the UK Singles Chart, and has since become one of Bush's most popular and enduring songs.\n\n**Music and Lyrics**\n\nThe song's music and lyrics were written by Kate Bush, who has described it as a song about the idea of wishing to live someone else's life, specifically the life of someone who has a more normal and easy existence. The lyrics are introspective and emotional, with Bush singing about the pain and longing of trying to escape her own reality. Musically, the song features a mix of synthesizers, guitars, and a driving beat, with Bush's distinctive vocals taking center stage.\n\n## Composition\n\nThe song's composition is notable for its use of complex time signatures and polyrhythms, which create a sense of tension and release that complements the emotional intensity of the lyrics.

The vocals were also heavily processed using a range of effects, including reverb and delay.\n\n**Music Video**\n\nThe song's music video was directed by Tim Pope and features Bush performing the song in a range of surreal and dreamlike scenarios. The video was a critical and commercial success, and helped to further establish Bush as a major force in the music industry.\n\n## Concept\n\nThe video's concept is based on the idea of Bush's character trying to escape her own reality and live someone else's life. The video features a range of symbolic and metaphorical images, including a character trapped in a maze, a figure floating in mid-air, and a room filled with clocks.\n\n**Release**\n\nThe song was released in June 1985 as the second single from Bush's album \"Hounds of Love\".

The album marks a departure from Swift's previous work, exploring themes of introspection, self-discovery, and emotional growth. With 13 tracks, Midnights is a deeply personal and experimental album that showcases Swift's musical versatility.\n\n**Background**\n\nTaylor Swift's career has been defined by her ability to craft relatable and introspective songs that resonate with her devoted fan base. After the success of her 2019 album \"Lover,\" Swift began working on a new project, which would eventually become Midnights.

Bagley\n\nTennent Hugh Bagley is a retired CIA officer and author, best known for his analysis of the KGB-CIA war and his involvement in several high-profile espionage cases. His work has been widely recognized and respected within the intelligence community, and his books have been praised for their insight and detail.\n\nEarly life and education\n\nBagley was born in 1920 in the United States. He graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, and later earned a master's degree in international relations from the same institution. Before joining the CIA, Bagley worked as a journalist and a correspondent for several newspapers and magazines.\n\nCareer\n\nBagley joined the CIA in 1947 and served for over 25 years, working in various positions, including as a case officer, a station chief, and a senior analyst. He was involved in several high-profile espionage cases, including the KGB-CIA war, the Popov case, and the Nosenko case. Bagley was also involved in the development of the CIA's counterintelligence programs and was a key figure in the agency's efforts to counter Soviet espionage.\n\nBagley's Analysis of the KGB-CIA War\n\nIn his book \"Spy Wars,\" Bagley provides a detailed analysis of the KGB-CIA war, which he describes as a decades-long struggle between the two intelligence agencies. According to Bagley, the KGB was highly effective in infiltrating the CIA and stealing its secrets, while the CIA was often unable to penetrate the KGB's inner workings. Bagley argues that the CIA's failure to understand the KGB's methods and motivations was a major factor in the agency's inability to counter Soviet espionage.\n\nThe Popov Case\n\nOne of the most notable cases Bagley was involved in was the Popov case. Dusan \"Dusko\" Popov was a Yugoslavian double agent who worked for the British SOE and later for the CIA. Popov was known for his bravery and his ability to infiltrate high-level Soviet intelligence circles. However, Popov was also known to be reckless and impulsive, and his behavior often put himself and others at risk. Bagley worked closely with Popov and helped to develop his skills as a double agent.\n\nThe Golienewski Case\n\nAnother case Bagley was involved in was the Golienewski case. Golienewski was a Soviet defector who provided the CIA with valuable information about the Soviet Union's nuclear program. However, Golienewski's credibility was later called into question when it was discovered that he had been lying about his background and his motivations. Bagley was criticized for his role in handling the Golienewski case, and some have argued that he was too quick to accept Golienewski's claims without properly verifying them.\n\nThe Nosenko Case\n\nThe Nosenko case was a highly publicized and contentious case involving a Soviet defector named Yuri Nosenko. Nosenko claimed to have been a high-ranking KGB official who had defected to the West, but his claims were later disputed by the CIA. Bagley was involved in the handling of the Nosenko case and argued that Nosenko was a genuine defector who had provided valuable information about the KGB. However, others have argued that Nosenko was a fabricator who had been working for the KGB all along.\n\nNosenko and the \"Zepp\" Incident\n\nOne of the most significant incidents involving Nosenko was the \"Zepp\" incident. Nosenko claimed to have been involved in a high-level KGB operation code-named \"Zepp,\" which allegedly involved the assassination of a high-ranking Soviet official. However, when the CIA asked Nosenko for more information about the \"Zepp\" operation, Nosenko was unable to provide any details. Some have argued that Nosenko's failure to provide information about the \"Zepp\" operation suggests that he was not a genuine defector.\n\nMore Nosenko\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding the Nosenko case, Bagley remained a strong supporter of Nosenko and argued that he was a genuine defector who had provided valuable information about the KGB. However, others have argued that Bagley was too quick to accept Nosenko's claims without properly verifying them.\n\nThe KITTY HAWK / Shadrin Case\n\nThe KITTY HAWK/Shadrin case was a highly publicized case involving a Soviet defector named Anatoli Shadrin. Shadrin claimed to have been a high-ranking KGB official who had defected to the West, but his claims were later disputed by the CIA. Bagley was involved in the handling of the Shadrin case and argued that Shadrin was a genuine defector who had provided valuable information about the KGB. However, others have argued that Shadrin was a fabricator who had been working for the KGB all along.\n\nRebuttal to John L. Hart's HSCA testimony\n\nIn 1976, John L. Hart, a CIA officer, testified before the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) about the CIA's role in the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. Bagley was critical of Hart's testimony and argued that Hart had been misinformed or had misrepresented the facts. Bagley claimed that the CIA had not been involved in the assassinations and that Hart's testimony was an attempt to deflect blame from the agency.\n\nReactions to his Spy Wars book\n\nBagley's book \"Spy Wars\" was widely praised by critics and readers for its detailed and insightful analysis of the KGB-CIA war. However, some reviewers criticized Bagley for his sympathetic portrayal of the CIA and his failure to provide a more balanced perspective on the agency's activities. Others praised Bagley for his bravery in speaking out against the CIA's mistakes and for his commitment to uncovering the truth about the agency's activities.\n\nIn popular culture\n\nBagley's work has been referenced in several books and articles, including a novel by Tom Clancy that features a character based on Bagley. Bagley's experiences as a CIA officer have also been the subject of several documentaries and films, including a 2013 biography that explores his life and career.\n\nPersonal life\n\nBagley is married and has two children. He lives in the United States and continues to write and speak about his experiences as a CIA officer. Despite his involvement in several high-profile espionage cases, Bagley remains a private person and has chosen not to seek public office or to engage in public advocacy.\n\nReferences", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The monument, also known as the \"American Stonehenge,\" was erected in 1979 and features a series of cryptic inscriptions that have sparked controversy and debate. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the history, description, and interpretations of the Georgia Guidestones.\n\n**History**\n------------\n\n### Construction\n\nThe Georgia Guidestones were designed by a man who identified himself as \"R.C. Christian,\" a pseudonym that has not been conclusively linked to any individual. Christian was a resident of Georgia who claimed to be a representative of a group of individuals who wanted to create a monument that would inspire and guide humanity towards a more enlightened and peaceful future. The monument was constructed by Elberton Granite Finishing Company, which was owned by the family of the company's president, Ray Elbert.\n\nThe construction of the monument began on March 22, 1979, and was completed on March 22, 1980. The total cost of the project was estimated to be around $50,000. The monument consists of four large granite slabs, each weighing over 20 tons, and a smaller capstone that weighs over 20 tons.\n\n### Reaction\n\nThe Georgia Guidestones were initially met with a mixture of curiosity and skepticism by the local community. Some residents saw the monument as a legitimate attempt to promote a message of peace and unity, while others viewed it as a collection of cryptic and disturbing phrases. The monument's design and inscriptions sparked heated debates and discussions, with some people interpreting the messages as a call to global domination or a warning of impending catastrophe.\n\n### Destruction\n\nOn July 6, 2022, a portion of the monument was intentionally damaged when a 61-year-old Georgia man, William Jewell Jennings III, used a 5-foot-long sledgehammer to break off the top portion of the center stone. Jennings, who claimed to be motivated by a desire to destroy the monument's \"New World Order\" message, was arrested and charged with vandalism.\n\n#### Aftermath\n\nThe destruction of the monument sparked a heated debate about its significance and the motivations of the perpetrator. Some people saw the incident as a senseless act of vandalism, while others viewed it as a chance to re-evaluate the monument's message and significance. The Elbert County Sheriff's Office estimated the cost of repairing the damage to be around $20,000 to $30,000.\n\n**Description**\n---------------\n\n### Inscriptions\n\nThe Georgia Guidestones feature a series of inscriptions that are divided into four panels, each containing a different message. The inscriptions are etched into the granite slabs and are written in four different languages:\n\n* English: \"Let these be our guides\"\n* Spanish: \"Sean nuestros guías\"\n* Swahili: \"Arika na maono yetu\"\n* Russian: \"Напоминайте нам эти принципы\"\n\nThe inscriptions are a call to humanity to adopt certain principles and values, including:\n\n* Maintain humanity under 500,000,000 in perpetual balance with nature.\n* Guide reproduction wisely - improving fitness and diversity.\n* Unite humanity with a living new language.\n* Rule passion - faith - tradition - and all things with tempered reason.\n\n### Explanatory tablet\n\nA smaller tablet, located at the base of the monument, explains the purpose of the inscriptions and provides additional context. The tablet reads:\n\n\"Let these be our guides in the common quest for a higher standard of living. May we test the depths of our wisdom in the light of our imagination and the breadth of our mind. May we realize that the world is a universe of thought and that the infinite possibilities within us will lead us to a higher share of power and a greater sense of well-being.\"\n\n### Physical data\n\nThe Georgia Guidestones are constructed from Elberton granite, a type of granite that is found in the nearby mountains. The monument stands 19.67 feet tall and 10 feet wide, with a total weight of over 20 tons. The four slabs are arranged in a circular pattern, with the center stone bearing the capstone.\n\n### Guidestone languages\n\nThe inscriptions on the Georgia Guidestones are written in four different languages: English, Spanish, Swahili, and Russian. The languages are chosen to reflect the diversity of the world's population and to emphasize the universal nature of the message.\n\n### Astronomical features\n\nThe Georgia Guidestones are aligned with the summer solstice sunrise, which occurs on June 21. This alignment is a deliberate design choice that reflects the monument's emphasis on the natural world and the passage of time.\n\n**Interpretations**\n------------------\n\n### Conspiracy theories\n\nThe Georgia Guidestones have been the subject of numerous conspiracy theories, which often focus on the monument's alleged connections to secret societies, Illuminati, and New World Order agendas. Some people believe that the monument is a call to global domination, while others see it as a warning of impending catastrophe. Despite the lack of evidence to support these claims, the monument's cryptic inscriptions and mysterious design have contributed to its reputation as a source of fascination and speculation.\n\n**See also**\n------------\n\n* American Stonehenge\n* Elberton Granite Finishing Company\n* New World Order\n* Illuminati\n* Secret societies\n* Georgia history\n\n**References**\n--------------\n\n* [No references provided]\n\n**Further reading**\n-------------------\n\n* [No further reading provided]\n\n**External links**\n-------------------\n\n* [No external links provided]", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

It is a fundamental component of the Earth's physical environment and plays a crucial role in shaping the planet's climate, ecosystems, and human societies. This article provides an overview of land, covering its definition, etymology, physical science aspects, features, layers, life science aspects, human interactions, and environmental issues.\n\n**Definition**\n\nLand is typically defined as the solid, dry, and relatively stable surface of the Earth, excluding water bodies, glaciers, and other bodies that cover the surface. The term \"land\" is often used interchangeably with \"earth\" or \"ground,\" although \"earth\" can also refer to the planet as a whole. Land is a critical component of the Earth's system, influencing the planet's climate, weather patterns, and ecosystems.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe word \"land\" has its roots in Old English, where it was spelled \"lond\" or \"land.\" This term is derived from the Proto-Germanic word \"*landiz,\" which is also the source of the Modern German word \"Land.\" The Proto-Germanic word is thought to be derived from the Proto-Indo-European root \"*lendh-,\" which meant \"to lie\" or \"to stretch.\" This root is also seen in other languages, such as Latin \"lend\" and Greek \"λἑνδος\" (lendos), both of which mean \"to stretch\" or \"to extend.\"\n\n**Physical Science**\n\n**Formation**\n\nLand is formed through various geological processes, including plate tectonics, weathering, erosion, and deposition. Plate tectonics involves the movement of the Earth's crust, which can lead to the formation of mountains, volcanoes, and oceanic and continental crust. Weathering breaks down rocks into smaller particles, which can then be transported and deposited through erosion. Deposition occurs when sediment is carried by water, ice, or wind and is deposited in a new location, often forming new landforms.\n\n**Landmasses**\n\nThe Earth's landmasses are divided into several continents, including Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America. These continents are separated by oceans, which cover about 71% of the Earth's surface. The continents are dynamic and have changed significantly over time due to plate tectonics.\n\n**Terrain**\n\nLand terrain varies greatly, from flat plains and low-lying areas to high mountains and rugged coastlines. Terrain can be classified into several types, including plains, plateaus, mountains, hills, and valleys. Terrain plays a critical role in shaping the climate and ecosystems of an area.\n\n**Geomorphology**\n\nGeomorphology is the study of the physical features of the Earth's surface, including landforms, water bodies, and other natural features. Geomorphology involves the analysis of the processes that shape the Earth's surface, including weathering, erosion, deposition, and plate tectonics.\n\n**Climate**\n\nClimate is influenced by the Earth's land surface, particularly through the process of radiative forcing, which involves the absorption and emission of solar and terrestrial radiation. Land cover, soil type, and vegetation all play important roles in shaping the local and regional climate.\n\n**Features**\n\n**Coasts and Islands**\n\nCoasts are areas where land meets the sea, and they can be classified into several types, including sandy beaches, rocky shores, and estuaries.

From its humble beginnings in the late 19th century to the present day, the telephone has played a vital role in shaping American society, culture, and economy. This article will explore the history of the telephone in the United States, focusing on the key events, figures, and developments that have shaped the industry.\n\n**#AT&T and the Bell System**\n\nThe American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T) was founded in 1885, and it would go on to become the largest telecommunications company in the United States. However, the history of the telephone in the United States begins earlier, with the establishment of the American Bell Telephone Company in 1881.\n\n**##American Bell Telephone Company (1881–1899)**\n\nIn 1876, Alexander Graham Bell invented the first practical telephone. He patented the device on March 7, 1876, and quickly established the Bell Telephone Company to manufacture and sell the instrument. In 1881, the company was renamed the American Bell Telephone Company, and it began to expand its operations across the United States. During this period, the company focused on developing the technology and infrastructure necessary to support the growth of the telephone industry.\n\n**##AT&T (1899–1982)**\n\nIn 1899, AT&T was formed through the merger of the American Bell Telephone Company and several other telephone companies. Under the leadership of Theodore Vail, AT&T began to expand its operations across the United States, establishing a nationwide network of telephone lines and switching systems. During this period, AT&T also made significant investments in research and development, leading to the introduction of new technologies such as the automatic switchboard and the long-distance telephone.\n\n**##Research priority**\n\nResearch and development played a critical role in the growth and development of the telephone industry in the United States. AT&T invested heavily in research, establishing a number of laboratories and research centers across the country. These facilities were dedicated to the development of new technologies and the improvement of existing ones. The company's research priorities were focused on a number of areas, including the development of new switching systems, the improvement of long-distance service, and the introduction of new services such as direct distance dialing.\n\n**##Targeting an audience**\n\nAs the telephone industry grew and expanded, AT&T began to target specific audiences with its services. Two of the key areas of focus were urban public telephones and rural telephone service.\n\n**###Urban public telephones**\n\nIn urban areas, AT&T established a network of public telephones that were accessible to the general public. These telephones were typically located in public places such as shopping centers, hotels, and train stations. The company also introduced a number of services designed to make it easier for people to use public telephones, including the introduction of coin-operated payphones and the establishment of a network of telephone booths.\n\n**###Rural telephone service**\n\nIn rural areas, AT&T faced a number of challenges in providing telephone service, including the difficulty of establishing telephone lines and the lack of a reliable power supply. To address these challenges, the company introduced a number of specialized services, including the use of wireless telegraphy and the establishment of rural telephone cooperatives. These cooperatives were owned and operated by local communities, and they provided telephone service to rural areas that were not served by AT&T.\n\n**##Breakup of AT&T in 1982**\n\nIn 1982, the United States government broke up AT&T into seven regional Bell operating companies, also known as Baby Bells. This breakup was the result of a long-standing antitrust lawsuit, and it was designed to increase competition in the telecommunications industry. The breakup of AT&T marked the end of the company's dominance of the telecommunications industry, and it paved the way for the entry of new competitors into the market.\n\n**#Cellphones and smartphones**\n\nThe introduction of cellphones and smartphones in the 1980s and 1990s revolutionized the telephone industry in the United States. These devices allowed people to make and receive calls from anywhere, at any time, and they provided a range of additional features such as texting, email, and internet access. The growth of the cellphone industry was fueled by the introduction of new technologies such as digital signal processing and the development of 3G and 4G networks.\n\n**#Personnel**\n\nThe telephone industry in the United States has employed a large and diverse workforce over the years. Some of the key personnel in the industry have included switchboard operators, laborers, and engineers.\n\n**##Switchboard and operators**\n\nSwitchboard operators played a critical role in the early days of the telephone industry, connecting calls and providing information to customers. They were typically women who worked in a central location, answering phones and transferring calls to other operators or to individuals on the telephone network.\n\n**##Labor force: bias for and against women**\n\nThe telephone industry in the United States has had a complex and often contentious relationship with women. On the one hand, women were often employed in switchboard and operator positions, and they played a critical role in the growth and development of the industry. On the other hand, women were often subjected to bias and discrimination in the workplace, including lower pay and fewer opportunities for advancement.\n\n**###Strikes**\n\nThe telephone industry in the United States has a long history of labor disputes and strikes. In the early 20th century, switchboard operators and other workers went on strike to demand better wages and working conditions. The strikes were often violent and led to the formation of labor unions and the passage of labor legislation.\n\n**##Hawthorne studies**\n\nThe Hawthorne studies, conducted in the 1920s and 1930s, were a series of experiments designed to improve worker productivity and efficiency. The studies were conducted at the Hawthorne Works factory in Illinois, and they involved a range of techniques such as lighting and temperature experiments. The studies were influential in the development of human relations management and the recognition of the importance of worker morale and motivation.\n\n**##Employee benefits**\n\nThe telephone industry in the United States has a long history of providing employee benefits to its workers. Some of the benefits include health insurance, retirement plans, and paid time off.\n\n**#Users**\n\nThe telephone industry in the United States has a diverse range of users, including businesses, housewives, and individuals.\n\n**##Business**\n\nBusinesses have played a critical role in the growth and development of the telephone industry in the United States. Many businesses rely on the telephone for communication and customer service, and they have invested heavily in telephone technology and infrastructure.\n\n**##Housewives**\n\nHousewives have also played a significant role in the telephone industry in the United States. Many housewives have used the telephone for social and domestic purposes, including calling friends and family and ordering goods and services.\n\n**##Gender and culture roles**\n\nThe telephone industry in the United States has had a complex and often contentious relationship with issues of gender and culture. Women have been employed in switchboard and operator positions, but they have also been subject to bias and discrimination in the workplace. The industry has also been shaped by cultural norms and values, including the expectation that women will be more likely to use the telephone for social and domestic purposes.\n\n**##Telemarketing**\n\nTelemarketing has become an increasingly important part of the telephone industry in the United States. Telemarketers use the telephone to sell goods and services directly to customers, and they often rely on scripts and other techniques to persuade customers to purchase.\n\n**##9-1-1**\n\nThe 9-1-1 emergency service has become an essential part of the telephone industry in the United States. The service allows people to call for emergency assistance in a simple and efficient way, and it has saved countless lives over the years.\n\n**##Harassing calls**\n\nHarassing calls have become a significant problem in the telephone industry in the United States. Harassing calls can take many forms, including unwanted solicitations, threatening messages, and other forms of harassment.\n\n**##Literary fears**\n\nThe telephone industry in the United States has also been shaped by literary and cultural fears. For example, the telephone has been depicted as a source of anxiety and fear in works of literature such as \"The Telephone\" by Jean Cocteau and \"The Machine Stops\" by E.M. Forster.\n\n**#See also**\n\n* History of the telephone\n* American Telephone and Telegraph Company\n* Bell Telephone Company\n* Switchboard\n* Operator\n* Telemarketing\n* 9-1-1\n* Harassing calls\n\n**#References**\n\n* \"The Telephone: A History\" by William F.
