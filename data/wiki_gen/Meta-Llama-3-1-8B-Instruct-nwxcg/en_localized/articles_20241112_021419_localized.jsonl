The Polish judiciary is composed of various types of courts, including common courts, military courts, the Supreme Court, administrative courts, the Constitutional Tribunal, and the State Tribunal.\n\n**Structure**\n\n### Common Courts\n\nCommon courts in Poland are the primary courts of first instance and are responsible for hearing civil and criminal cases. There are four levels of common courts in Poland: district courts, regional courts, courts of appeal, and the Supreme Court. District courts are the courts of first instance and have jurisdiction over civil, administrative, and penal cases. Regional courts are courts of appeal and have jurisdiction over cases involving disputes over property or claims for damages. Courts of appeal are the highest courts of appeal and have jurisdiction over cases on appeal from the regional courts.\n\n### Military Courts\n\nMilitary courts in Poland have jurisdiction over military personnel and are responsible for hearing cases involving military crimes and offenses. There are three levels of military courts in Poland: military district courts, military courts of appeal, and the Supreme Court.\n\n### Supreme Court\n\nThe Supreme Court of Poland is the highest court in the Polish judiciary and has jurisdiction over all cases on appeal from the courts of appeal. The Supreme Court is responsible for hearing cases involving constitutional issues, as well as cases on appeal from the courts of appeal.\n\n### Administrative Courts\n\nAdministrative courts in Poland have jurisdiction over cases involving disputes between citizens and administrative authorities. There are three levels of administrative courts in Poland: administrative courts, administrative courts of appeal, and the Supreme Court.\n\n### Constitutional Tribunal\n\nThe Constitutional Tribunal of Poland is a constitutional court that has jurisdiction over cases involving the constitutionality of laws and regulations. The Tribunal is composed of 15 judges who are appointed by the Sejm (Poland's parliament) and the President of Poland.\n\n### State Tribunal\n\nThe State Tribunal of Poland is a special court that has jurisdiction over cases involving crimes committed by public officials. The State Tribunal is composed of 15 judges who are appointed by the Sejm (Poland's parliament) and the President of Poland.\n\n**Procedure**\n\nThe procedure for cases in the Polish judiciary involves several stages, including the filing of a complaint, the investigation, and the trial. In civil cases, the plaintiff files a complaint with the court, which then conducts an investigation and schedules a trial. In criminal cases, the prosecutor files a complaint with the court, which then conducts an investigation and schedules a trial. The trial is conducted in an adversarial manner, with the prosecutor presenting evidence and the defendant presenting a defense.\n\n**Staff**\n\n### Judges and Court Assessors\n\nJudges and court assessors in Poland are responsible for hearing cases and making decisions. Judges are appointed by the National Council of the Judiciary (KRS) for a period of 6 years, while court assessors are appointed by the Minister of Justice for a period of 3 years.\n\n### National Council of the Judiciary\n\nThe National Council of the Judiciary (KRS) is a self-governing body that is responsible for appointing judges and court assessors. The KRS is composed of 25 members who are elected by the Sejm (Poland's parliament) for a period of 6 years.\n\n#### Procedure of Appointment\n\nThe procedure for appointing judges and court assessors involves several stages. The KRS reviews applications and selects candidates who meet the required qualifications. The KRS then forwards the list of candidates to the President of Poland, who makes the final selection.\n\n#### Rights and Duties\n\nJudges and court assessors have several rights and duties, including the right to independence and the duty to uphold the law. Judges and court assessors are also required to disclose any conflicts of interest and to recuse themselves from cases in which they have a personal interest.\n\n### Judges Sitting in the Tribunals\n\nJudges sitting in the tribunals in Poland are responsible for hearing cases and making decisions. Judges in the tribunals are appointed by the President of Poland for a period of 6 years.\n\n### Other Judicial Positions\n\nOther judicial positions in Poland include the President of the Supreme Court, the President of the Constitutional Tribunal, and the President of the State Tribunal. These positions are appointed by the President of Poland for a period of 6 years.\n\n### Remuneration\n\nJudges and court assessors in Poland receive a salary and other benefits, including a pension and health insurance. The salary and benefits of judges and court assessors are determined by the Minister of Justice.\n\n**Minimal Requirements**\n\nTo become a judge or court assessor in Poland, an individual must meet several minimal requirements, including:\n\n* Being a citizen of Poland\n* Being at least 25 years old\n* Having a university degree in law\n* Having at least 5 years of experience in the legal profession\n* Passing a competitive examination\n\n**Issues**\n\n### Length of Proceedings\n\nOne of the major issues in the Polish judiciary is the length of proceedings. Cases can take years to be heard, which can lead to frustration and disappointment for citizens. The length of proceedings is often caused by a lack of resources and a heavy workload.\n\n### Lack of Popular Support and Trust\n\nThe Polish judiciary is often criticized for a lack of popular support and trust. Citizens often view the judiciary as being corrupt and biased. This lack of trust can be caused by a variety of factors, including a lack of transparency and a lack of accountability.\n\n### Other Issues\n\nOther issues in the Polish judiciary include a lack of resources, a heavy workload, and a lack of modernization. The Polish judiciary is in need of modernization and reform, including the introduction of new technologies and the streamlining of procedures.\n\n### Rule of Law Concerns\n\nThe Polish judiciary is also subject to rule of law concerns, including the capture of the Constitutional Tribunal, undue influence on judges, and partisan control of the National Council of the Judiciary.\n\n#### Capture of the Constitutional Tribunal\n\nThe capture of the Constitutional Tribunal refers to the attempt by the ruling party to control the Tribunal by appointing loyal judges. The capture of the Tribunal is a major concern for the rule of law in Poland.\n\n#### Undue Influence on Judges\n\nUndue influence on judges refers to the attempt by the ruling party to influence the decisions of judges. This can include pressure from the government, the media, or other external factors.\n\n#### Partisan Control of the National Council of the Judiciary\n\nPartisan control of the National Council of the Judiciary refers to the attempt by the ruling party to control the KRS by appointing loyal members. The partisan control of the KRS is a major concern for the rule of law in Poland.\n\n#### Arbitrary Secondment of Judges\n\nThe arbitrary secondment of judges refers to the practice of transferring judges from one court to another without their consent. This practice is often used to punish judges who are deemed to be disloyal to the ruling party.\n\n### Repercussions in Poland and Abroad\n\nThe repercussions of the rule of law concerns in Poland include a loss of credibility and a decline in democracy. The Polish judiciary is no longer seen as an independent institution, but rather as a tool of the ruling party.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Judiciary\n* Constitutional Tribunal\n* Supreme Court\n* National Council of the Judiciary\n* Poland\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is intended to provide a comprehensive overview of the Polish judiciary.\n* The information in this article is based on publicly available sources and is intended to be accurate and reliable.\n* The Polish judiciary is a complex and multifaceted institution, and this article is intended to provide a general understanding of its structure, procedures, and issues.\n\n**References**\n\n* This article does not contain any references.\n\n**External links**\n\n* Polish judiciary website\n* National Council of the Judiciary website\n* Constitutional Tribunal website\n* Supreme Court website", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The incident escalated into a diplomatic crisis, with the United States and China engaging in a tense exchange over the balloon's presence in U.S. airspace and its potential surveillance capabilities.\n\n**Background**\n\n### History and Development of Reconnaissance Balloons\n\nReconnaissance balloons have been used by various countries for decades as a means of gathering intelligence from high altitudes. These balloons are designed to fly above commercial air traffic and can be equipped with a range of sensors and communication equipment to gather signals intelligence (SIGINT) and other types of data.\n\n### Past Chinese Balloons and Unidentified Objects\n\nChina has a history of launching reconnaissance balloons, which have been detected over the United States and other countries. In 2000, a Chinese balloon was spotted over the United States, and in 2015, a similar incident occurred. In recent years, China has also been accused of launching small, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to gather intelligence.\n\n### U.S.–China Tensions\n\nThe relationship between the United States and China has been tense in recent years, with disagreements over issues such as trade, security, and human rights. The two countries have also been engaged in a series of diplomatic and military competitions, including a technology war and a competition for influence in the Pacific.\n\n**Incident**\n\n### Balloon\n\nThe Chinese balloon that sparked the incident was a high-altitude balloon, approximately 200 feet tall and 60 feet wide. It was equipped with a range of sensors and communication equipment, including SIGINT capabilities. The balloon was powered by a combination of solar panels and a high-pressure gas system.\n\n### Signals Intelligence Capabilities\n\nThe balloon was likely equipped with SIGINT equipment to gather communications intelligence from the United States. SIGINT capabilities allow for the interception and analysis of communications signals, including phone calls, emails, and other forms of digital communication. The balloon's SIGINT capabilities were likely used to gather data on U.S. military communications and other sensitive information.\n\n### Detection\n\nThe Chinese balloon was first detected on January 28, 2023, by a U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM) radar system in Alaska. The balloon was tracked as it flew over Canada and into U.S. airspace, where it was detected by a range of sensors and surveillance systems.\n\n### Flight Path\n\nThe balloon's flight path took it over several U.S. states, including Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. The balloon flew at altitudes of up to 60,000 feet and was tracked by a range of U.S. military and civilian systems.\n\n### U.S. Monitoring and Counterintelligence\n\nThe U.S. military and intelligence agencies closely monitored the balloon's flight and tracked its movements. The U.S. also used a range of counterintelligence measures to try to disable or destroy the balloon.\n\n### Downing\n\nOn February 4, 2023, the U.S. military shot down the Chinese balloon off the coast of South Carolina using an F-22 fighter jet. The balloon was destroyed by a single AIM-9X missile, which was fired from the F-22 at an altitude of around 60,000 feet.\n\n### Debris Recovery\n\nThe U.S. military recovered a significant amount of debris from the downed balloon, including a large portion of the balloon's payload and a range of sensors and communication equipment.\n\n**Legality of Airspace and Downing**\n\nThe incident raised questions about the legality of the Chinese balloon's presence in U.S. airspace and the U.S. decision to shoot it down. The U.S. has a range of laws and regulations governing airspace and the use of force, including the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and the Convention on International Civil Aviation (Chicago Convention).\n\n**Response and Reactions**\n\n### United States\n\nThe U.S. government responded quickly to the incident, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken announcing that the balloon was a surveillance device and that it had been shot down. The U.S. also imposed sanctions on several Chinese companies involved in the development and launch of the balloon.\n\n### Canada\n\nCanada responded to the incident by announcing that it would be reviewing its relationship with China and considering new sanctions. Canada also expressed concerns about the balloon's presence in its airspace and the potential implications for national security.\n\n### China\n\nChina responded to the incident by denying that the balloon was a surveillance device and accusing the U.S. of overreacting. China also expressed concerns about the U.S. decision to shoot down the balloon and the implications for the relationship between the two countries.\n\n### NATO\n\nNATO responded to the incident by expressing concerns about the balloon's presence in international airspace and the potential implications for national security. NATO also called on China to explain the purpose of the balloon and to provide more information about its activities.\n\n### Australia\n\nAustralia responded to the incident by announcing that it would be reviewing its relationship with China and considering new sanctions. Australia also expressed concerns about the balloon's presence in its airspace and the potential implications for national security.\n\n### Japan\n\nJapan responded to the incident by expressing concerns about the balloon's presence in its airspace and the potential implications for national security. Japan also called on China to explain the purpose of the balloon and to provide more information about its activities.\n\n### Singapore\n\nSingapore responded to the incident by announcing that it would be reviewing its relationship with China and considering new sanctions. Singapore also expressed concerns about the balloon's presence in its airspace and the potential implications for national security.\n\n### United Kingdom\n\nThe United Kingdom responded to the incident by expressing concerns about the balloon's presence in international airspace and the potential implications for national security. The UK also called on China to explain the purpose of the balloon and to provide more information about its activities.\n\n### Venezuela\n\nVenezuela responded to the incident by announcing that it would be reviewing its relationship with China and considering new sanctions. Venezuela also expressed concerns about the balloon's presence in its airspace and the potential implications for national security.\n\n### Media Reactions\n\n#### Analysis\n\nThe incident sparked a range of analysis and commentary from media outlets around the world. Many analysts saw the balloon as a significant escalation of tensions between the U.S. and China, and raised concerns about the implications for national security and global stability.\n\n#### Satire\n\nSome media outlets used satire to comment on the incident, with many poking fun at the balloon's size and the U.S. decision to shoot it down. Others used humor to highlight the absurdity of the situation and the tensions between the two countries.\n\n**Other High-Altitude Objects in February 2023**\n\nIn addition to the Chinese balloon, there were several other high-altitude objects detected in February 2023. These included a number of small, unidentified objects and a large, unidentified balloon detected over the Pacific Ocean.\n\n**Additional Assessments of the Balloon**\n\nThe incident has sparked a range of assessments and analyses, including a review of the U.S. military's response to the balloon and the implications for national security. Many experts have raised concerns about the potential implications for the relationship between the U.S. and China and the potential for future incidents.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* **International relations**\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is a summary of the 2023 Chinese balloon incident, and is based on publicly available information.\n* The article is intended to provide a neutral and encyclopedic account of the incident, and is not intended to take a partisan or advocacy position.\n* The article is subject to revision as new information becomes available.\n* The article is intended to provide a comprehensive overview of the incident, and is not intended to be a detailed or technical analysis.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

These wells can pose significant environmental, economic, and social risks, particularly in the context of the province's oil and gas industry. This article provides an overview of the current situation regarding orphan wells in Alberta, including the context, landowners and municipalities, the Orphan Well Association, funding, the Alberta Energy Regulator, and the legal and regulatory considerations.\n\n**Current Overview**\n\nAs of 2022, it is estimated that there are over 98,000 abandoned and inactive oil and gas wells in Alberta, with approximately 12,000 of these considered orphaned. The majority of these orphan wells are located in the province's oil sands region, where the extraction of heavy oil has been a significant activity for several decades. The abandonment of these wells has been a long-standing issue in Alberta, with the province's energy regulator, the Alberta Energy Regulator (AER), estimating that it will cost tens of millions of dollars to plug and abandon the orphan wells.\n\n**Context**\n\nThe issue of orphan wells in Alberta is closely tied to the province's oil and gas industry, which has been a significant contributor to the province's economy for several decades. However, the industry's growth has also led to concerns about the environmental impacts of oil and gas extraction, including the release of greenhouse gases, the contamination of water sources, and the degradation of land. The issue of orphan wells is also closely tied to the concept of the \"polluter pays principle,\" which holds that those responsible for environmental damage should be held accountable for the costs of cleanup.\n\n**Landowners and Municipalities**\n\nLandowners and municipalities in Alberta have been affected by the issue of orphan wells in various ways. Many landowners have seen their property values decline due to the presence of abandoned wells, while municipalities have had to deal with the costs of maintaining the wells, including plugging and abandoning them. In some cases, landowners have also had to deal with the issue of fugitive gas emissions from abandoned wells, which can pose a significant risk to human health and safety.\n\n**Orphan Well Association**\n\nThe Orphan Well Association (OWA) is a non-profit organization that was established in 2018 to address the issue of orphan wells in Alberta. The OWA is responsible for identifying and plugging abandoned wells, as well as coordinating the cleanup efforts of other stakeholders. The OWA has been working closely with the AER, landowners, and municipalities to address the issue of orphan wells, and has been instrumental in raising awareness about the risks posed by abandoned wells.\n\n**OWA Funding**\n\nThe OWA is funded by a combination of federal and provincial subsidies, as well as contributions from industry stakeholders. The federal government has provided funding to the OWA through the Canada-Alberta Job Grant program, while the provincial government has provided funding through the Alberta Operating Grant program. Industry stakeholders, including oil and gas companies, have also contributed to the OWA's funding efforts.\n\n**Federal and Provincial Subsidies**\n\nThe federal government has provided significant funding to the OWA through the Canada-Alberta Job Grant program, which is designed to support job creation and skills training in the oil and gas industry. The program has provided funding to the OWA to support its operations, including the plugging and abandoning of orphan wells. The provincial government has also provided funding to the OWA through the Alberta Operating Grant program, which is designed to support the maintenance and cleanup of abandoned wells.\n\n**Alberta Energy Regulator**\n\nThe Alberta Energy Regulator (AER) is the provincial agency responsible for regulating the oil and gas industry in Alberta. The AER has been working closely with the OWA to address the issue of orphan wells, and has been responsible for overseeing the plugging and abandoning of abandoned wells. The AER has also been working to raise awareness about the risks posed by abandoned wells, and has developed guidelines for the safe abandonment of wells.\n\n**Legal and Regulatory Considerations**\n\nThe issue of orphan wells in Alberta is subject to a range of legal and regulatory considerations. The polluter pays principle is a key consideration, as it holds that those responsible for environmental damage should be held accountable for the costs of cleanup. The AER has also developed guidelines for the safe abandonment of wells, which are designed to minimize the risks posed by abandoned wells.\n\n**Polluter Pays Principle**\n\nThe polluter pays principle is a key consideration in the context of orphan wells in Alberta. The principle holds that those responsible for environmental damage should be held accountable for the costs of cleanup. The polluter pays principle is designed to ensure that those who cause environmental harm are held accountable for the costs of cleanup, rather than passing the costs on to others.\n\n**Suspended Inactive Wells**\n\nSuspended inactive wells are a type of abandoned well that has been temporarily suspended from operation. These wells are often maintained by their owners, but can pose a significant risk to human health and safety if they are not properly maintained.\n\n**Bankruptcies and Orphan Wells**\n\nBankruptcies and orphan wells are closely tied issues in Alberta. When oil and gas companies go bankrupt, their assets, including wells, can be abandoned and become orphaned. The issue of orphan wells is significant in Alberta, as many wells have been abandoned due to bankruptcy.\n\n**Strategic Packaging of Costly Liabilities with Productive Assets**\n\nThe strategic packaging of costly liabilities with productive assets is a common practice in the oil and gas industry. This involves packaging abandoned wells with productive wells in order to minimize the costs associated with plugging and abandoning the abandoned wells.\n\n**Environmental Impacts of Orphan Wells**\n\nThe environmental impacts of orphan wells in Alberta are significant. Fugitive gas emissions from abandoned wells can pose a significant risk to human health and safety, while surface casing vent flow (SCVF) and gas migration (GM) can contaminate water sources and soil.\n\n**Fugitive Gas Emissions**\n\nFugitive gas emissions from abandoned wells are a significant concern in Alberta. These emissions can pose a risk to human health and safety, and can also contribute to climate change.\n\n**Surface Casing Vent Flow (SCVF) and Gas Migration (GM)**\n\nSurface casing vent flow (SCVF) and gas migration (GM) are related issues in the context of orphan wells in Alberta. SCVF occurs when gas is released from the well casing, while GM occurs when gas migrates through the soil and contaminates water sources.\n\n**Potential Geothermal Conversion of Orphan Wells in Alberta**\n\nThe potential geothermal conversion of orphan wells in Alberta is an area of ongoing research. Geothermal conversion involves using abandoned wells to produce geothermal energy, which can provide a significant source of renewable energy. This approach can also help to minimize the environmental impacts of abandoned wells.\n\n**Responses**\n\nThe issue of orphan wells in Alberta has been met with a range of responses from stakeholders. The AER has been working to address the issue, while the OWA has been coordinating the cleanup efforts of other stakeholders. Industry stakeholders have also been working to minimize the environmental impacts of abandoned wells, including through the strategic packaging of costly liabilities with productive assets.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Alberta Energy Regulator (AER)\n* Orphan Well Association (OWA)\n* Canada-Alberta Job Grant program\n* Alberta Operating Grant program\n* Polluter pays principle\n\n**Notes**\n\nThis article has been written based on publicly available information and has not been peer-reviewed.\n\n**External Links**\n\n* Alberta Energy Regulator (AER)\n* Orphan Well Association (OWA)\n* Government of Alberta: Orphan Well Program\n* Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP): Orphan Wells\n\n**Citations**\n\n* None.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The crisis began with the liquidation of Silvergate Bank, followed by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic Bank.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe US banking system has faced numerous challenges in recent years, including the COVID-19 pandemic, rising inflation, and increasing regulatory requirements. The pandemic led to a significant increase in demand for government-backed loans, which put a strain on the banking system. Additionally, the Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates to combat inflation has reduced lending and increased borrowing costs, further weakening the banking sector.\n\n**Liquidation of Silvergate Bank**\n\n**Background**\n\nSilvergate Bank was a California-based bank that specialized in serving the cannabis industry and other specialized financial institutions. The bank had faced significant challenges in recent years, including a decline in revenue and a sharp increase in expenses. Despite efforts to diversify its business, Silvergate continued to struggle, leading to concerns about its financial stability.\n\n**Events**\n\nOn March 8, 2023, Silvergate Bank announced that it would be ceasing all operations and liquidating its assets. The bank's customers were informed that their deposits would be transferred to other banks, and that they would not be affected by the liquidation. However, the event marked the beginning of a series of bank failures that would shake the US banking system.\n\n**Collapse of Silicon Valley Bank**\n\n**Background**\n\nSilicon Valley Bank was a California-based bank that specialized in serving the technology industry. The bank had grown rapidly in recent years, fueled by the success of the tech industry and the influx of venture capital funding. However, the bank's rapid growth had also led to concerns about its financial stability, and it had been facing significant challenges in recent years.\n\n**Events**\n\nOn March 10, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank announced that it would be seeking to raise additional capital to address concerns about its financial stability. However, the bank's efforts were ultimately unsuccessful, and it was taken over by regulators on March 10. The bank's customers were informed that their deposits would be protected up to $250,000, but that the bank's shares and other assets would be sold to pay off creditors.\n\n**Collapse of Signature Bank**\n\n**Background**\n\nSignature Bank was a New York-based bank that specialized in serving the financial industry. The bank had grown rapidly in recent years, fueled by the success of the financial industry and the influx of deposits from other banks. However, the bank's rapid growth had also led to concerns about its financial stability, and it had been facing significant challenges in recent years.\n\n**Events**\n\nOn March 12, 2023, Signature Bank announced that it would be ceasing all operations and liquidating its assets. The bank's customers were informed that their deposits would be transferred to other banks, and that they would not be affected by the liquidation. However, the event marked the third bank failure in less than a week.\n\n**Collapse of First Republic Bank**\n\n**Background**\n\nFirst Republic Bank was a California-based bank that specialized in serving high-net-worth individuals and families. The bank had grown rapidly in recent years, fueled by the success of the wealth management industry and the influx of deposits from other banks. However, the bank's rapid growth had also led to concerns about its financial stability, and it had been facing significant challenges in recent years.\n\n**Events**\n\nOn March 15, 2023, First Republic Bank announced that it would be ceasing all operations and liquidating its assets. The bank's customers were informed that their deposits would be transferred to other banks, and that they would not be affected by the liquidation.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\n**Bank Term Funding Program**\n\nIn response to the bank failures, the Federal Reserve announced a Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) to provide liquidity to banks and other financial institutions. The program allows banks to borrow from the Fed at a rate of 4.75% to 5.25%, and provides up to $2.25 trillion in funding.\n\n**Government discussion of other funding**\n\nThe US government has also discussed other options for providing funding to banks and other financial institutions. These include a potential bailout of the banking system, as well as the use of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to provide insurance to depositors.\n\n**U.S. investigations**\n\nThe US government has launched investigations into the causes of the bank failures, including the actions of bank regulators, auditors, and management. The investigations are ongoing, and it is unclear what findings may be revealed.\n\n**Economic impact**\n\nThe bank failures have had a significant impact on the US economy, including a decline in stock prices and a rise in borrowing costs. The event has also led to a loss of confidence in the banking system, and has raised concerns about the stability of the financial sector.\n\n**International impact**\n\nThe bank failures have also had an impact on the global economy, including a decline in international trade and a rise in currency volatility. The event has also raised concerns about the stability of the global financial system.\n\n**See also**\n\n* List of bank failures in the United States\n* 2008 global financial crisis\n* 2020 coronavirus pandemic\n* Federal Reserve\n* Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

It is the third lunar mission of India, following Chandrayaan-1 and Chandrayaan-2. The mission aims to study the lunar surface and subsurface, and to demonstrate India's technological capabilities in lunar exploration.\n\n**History**\n\nThe idea of sending a mission to the Moon was first proposed by Vikram Sarabhai, the father of the Indian space program, in the 1960s. However, it was not until the 1990s that the Indian government began to seriously consider launching a lunar mission. In 2007, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) announced plans to launch a lunar mission, which would become Chandrayaan-1. Although Chandrayaan-1 was a success, it did not include a lunar lander. Chandrayaan-2, launched in 2019, included a lunar lander, but it failed to make a soft landing on the lunar surface.\n\nThe Chandrayaan-3 mission was announced in 2020, with the goal of landing on the Moon's south pole. The mission was designed to be more complex and ambitious than its predecessors, with a focus on lunar surface and subsurface exploration.\n\n**Objectives**\n\nThe main objectives of the Chandrayaan-3 mission are:\n\n* To study the lunar surface and subsurface using a combination of orbital and lander-based instruments\n* To demonstrate India's capability to land and operate on the lunar surface\n* To conduct scientific experiments on the lunar surface and subsurface\n* To test and validate technologies for future lunar missions\n\n**Spacecraft**\n\nThe Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft consists of three main components:\n\n### **Design**\n\nThe spacecraft is designed to be modular and flexible, with a focus on minimizing costs and maximizing scientific return. The spacecraft is composed of a propulsion module, a Vikram lander, and a rover called Pragyan.\n\n### **Propulsion module**\n\nThe propulsion module is responsible for launching the spacecraft into lunar orbit and for providing the necessary propulsion for the lander and rover to descend to the lunar surface. The propulsion module is equipped with a high-power propulsion system, which includes a liquid fuel engine and a solid fuel stage.\n\n### **Vikram lander**\n\nThe Vikram lander is designed to descend to the lunar surface and to conduct scientific experiments on the lunar surface. The lander is equipped with a range of instruments, including a terrain mapping camera, a seismometer, and a radar altimeter.\n\n### **Rover Pragyan**\n\nThe rover Pragyan is designed to explore the lunar surface and to conduct scientific experiments. The rover is equipped with a range of instruments, including a terrain mapping camera, a spectrometer, and a magnetometer.\n\n## **Payloads**\n\nThe Chandrayaan-3 mission includes a range of scientific payloads, which are designed to study the lunar surface and subsurface.\n\n### **On lander**\n\nThe Vikram lander is equipped with the following payloads:\n\n* Terrain Mapping Camera (TMC)\n* Seismometer (SEIS)\n* Radar Altimeter (RA)\n* Laser RetroReflector (LRR)\n\n### **On rover**\n\nThe rover Pragyan is equipped with the following payloads:\n\n* Terrain Mapping Camera (TMC)\n* Spectrometer (SPC)\n* Magnetometer (MAG)\n* Gamma Ray Spectrometer (GRS)\n\n### **On the propulsion module**\n\nThe propulsion module is equipped with the following payloads:\n\n* Laser Altimeter (LA)\n* Spectrometer (SPC)\n* Magnetometer (MAG)\n\n**Mission profile**\n\nThe Chandrayaan-3 mission is designed to follow a complex and ambitious trajectory.\n\n## **Launch**\n\nThe Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft was launched on July 14, 2023, from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota, India. The spacecraft was launched using a GSLV Mk III rocket.\n\n## **Orbit**\n\nAfter launch, the spacecraft entered into a highly elliptical orbit around the Earth, where it remained for several weeks. During this time, the spacecraft was used to test the propulsion system and to conduct a series of orbital maneuvers.\n\n## **Landing**\n\nAfter several weeks in orbit, the spacecraft began its descent to the lunar surface. The propulsion module was used to slow down the spacecraft and to place the lander and rover on the lunar surface.\n\n## **Surface operations**\n\nOnce on the lunar surface, the rover Pragyan began its exploration of the lunar surface. The rover was designed to operate for several weeks, during which time it conducted a range of scientific experiments.\n\n## **Propulsion module reinserted to orbit around Earth**\n\nAfter several weeks of surface operations, the propulsion module was reinserted into lunar orbit, where it remained for several months. During this time, the propulsion module was used to conduct a series of scientific experiments and to test and validate technologies for future lunar missions.\n\n## **Mission life**\n\nThe Chandrayaan-3 mission is designed to operate for several months, during which time it will conduct a range of scientific experiments and test and validate technologies for future lunar missions.\n\n**Team**\n\nThe Chandrayaan-3 mission is a complex and ambitious undertaking, which requires a large team of scientists, engineers, and technicians.

It is situated about 30 kilometers (19 miles) north of Latakia, the capital city of the governorate. With a population of over 120,000 people, Tartus is a significant urban center in Syria and a major port city.\n\nEtymology\n------------\n\nThe name \"Tartus\" is derived from the ancient Greek city of Antaradus, which was founded in the 7th century BC. The city's name has undergone several changes over the centuries, with the Romans referring to it as Antarados and the Arabs calling it Tarabalus.\n\nHistory\n--------\n\n### Phoenician Antaradus\n\nThe city of Tartus was founded by the Phoenicians in the 7th century BC, making it one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. The Phoenicians established a major trading center in Tartus, which became an important hub for the Mediterranean trade. The city was known for its advanced naval architecture and shipbuilding techniques, which enabled the Phoenicians to establish a powerful fleet that dominated the Mediterranean Sea.\n\n### Greco-Roman and Byzantine era\n\nIn the 5th century BC, Tartus was conquered by the Greeks, who renamed it Antarados. The city became an important center of Greek culture and learning, and it was home to several notable philosophers and scholars. In the 1st century AD, Tartus was conquered by the Romans, who renamed it Antarados. During the Roman era, Tartus became an important center of trade and commerce, and it was known for its beautiful architecture and stunning natural beauty.\n\n### Early Islamic era\n\nIn the 7th century AD, Tartus was conquered by the Arabs, who renamed it Tarabalus. During the early Islamic era, Tartus became an important center of Islamic learning and culture, and it was home to several notable scholars and poets.

The opera premiered in 1896 and was later withdrawn and suppressed due to its perceived nationalism and criticism of the Russian Empire. Despite this, the opera experienced a posthumous revival in the 20th century, with many considering it a masterpiece of Finnish opera. This article provides an overview of the history, structure, music, and context of The Maiden in the Tower.\n\n**History**\n\n### Composition\n\nThe Maiden in the Tower was composed between 1891 and 1896, with Sibelius drawing inspiration from the Finnish national epic, the Kalevala. The opera was written in response to a request from the Finnish National Opera, which was seeking to promote Finnish culture and music. Sibelius's work was heavily influenced by the traditions of Finnish folklore and mythology, as well as the country's struggle for independence from Russia.\n\n### Premiere\n\nThe Maiden in the Tower premiered on August 5, 1896, at the Finnish National Opera in Helsinki. The opera was well-received by the audience, but received mixed reviews from critics, who criticized its nationalism and perceived anti-Russia sentiment. The premiere was attended by many prominent figures of Finnish society, including politicians, intellectuals, and artists.\n\n### Withdrawal and suppression\n\nFollowing the premiere, The Maiden in the Tower was withdrawn from the repertoire due to its perceived nationalism and criticism of the Russian Empire. The opera's themes and symbolism were seen as a threat to the Russian authorities, who viewed it as a challenge to their authority. The opera was effectively suppressed, and it was not performed again until the 20th century.\n\n### Posthumous revival\n\nIn the 20th century, The Maiden in the Tower experienced a posthumous revival, with many considering it a masterpiece of Finnish opera. The opera's themes of Finnish identity and nationalism were seen as a powerful expression of the country's struggle for independence. The opera has since been performed and recorded numerous times, and is widely regarded as one of Sibelius's most important works.\n\n**Structure and roles**\n\nThe Maiden in the Tower is a three-act opera, with a libretto by Lönnrot and Ilmari Krohn. The opera tells the story of a young woman who is imprisoned in a tower by a wicked sorcerer. The opera features a range of characters, including the maiden, the sorcerer, and a noble knight who seeks to rescue her.\n\n**Synopsis**\n\nThe opera begins with the maiden, who is being held captive in a tower by the sorcerer. The knight arrives and attempts to rescue her, but is thwarted by the sorcerer's magic. The maiden is forced to confront the sorcerer, who ultimately reveals his true intentions: to use her magical powers for his own gain. The knight returns, and together they defeat the sorcerer and escape from the tower.\n\n**Music**\n\nThe music of The Maiden in the Tower is characterized by its use of leitmotifs, which are recurring musical themes that represent different characters or ideas. The opera features a range of musical styles, including folk influences and more traditional operatic forms. The music is widely regarded as some of Sibelius's most beautiful and expressive work.\n\n**Context and analysis**\n\n### The plot as allegory\n\nThe Maiden in the Tower can be seen as an allegory for the Finnish struggle for independence from Russia. The opera's themes of captivity and liberation are seen as a powerful expression of the country's desire for self-determination. The sorcerer can be seen as a symbol of the Russian Empire, which seeks to oppress and dominate the Finnish people.\n\n### Opera and Finland's language strife\n\nThe Maiden in the Tower was written during a time of great cultural and linguistic tension in Finland. The country was struggling to assert its independence from Russia, and the use of the Finnish language was seen as a key aspect of this struggle. The opera's use of the Finnish language was seen as a powerful expression of Finnish identity and culture.\n\n### Later opinions of Sibelius's music\n\nIn the 20th century, Sibelius's music was widely regarded as some of the most important and influential of the time. The Maiden in the Tower was seen as a masterpiece of Finnish opera, and its music was widely admired for its beauty and expressiveness.\n\n### Reasons for post-1981 neglect\n\nDespite its posthumous revival, The Maiden in the Tower experienced a period of neglect in the years following 1981. This was due in part to the opera's perceived nationalism and criticism of the Russian Empire, which made it seem out of date and irrelevant. However, in recent years, the opera has experienced a renewed interest, and is once again widely regarded as a masterpiece of Finnish opera.\n\n**Discography**\n\nThe Maiden in the Tower has been recorded numerous times, with many notable performances and recordings.

The election was the 57th general election since the election of the first Parliament of New South Wales in 1856.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Previous election\n\nThe 2022 New South Wales state election was held on Saturday, 25 March 2022, to elect the members of the 56th Parliament of New South Wales. The election saw the Liberal Party of Australia, led by Dominic Perrottet, win a majority of seats in the Legislative Assembly, defeating the Labor Party, led by Chris Minns. However, the Liberal Party's victory was short-lived, as the party's leadership was marred by controversy and infighting, leading to Perrottet's resignation as Premier in December 2022.\n\n### Change of premiership, resignations and minority government\n\nIn December 2022, Chris Minns was elected as the leader of the Labor Party and became the Premier of New South Wales, ending the Liberal Party's tenure in office. The change in government also saw the resignation of several Liberal MPs, including the Deputy Premier, Paul Toole, and several other ministers. The Labor Party formed a minority government, with the support of several independent MPs.\n\n### Possibility of a hung parliament\n\nThe 2023 election was widely anticipated to be a closely contested affair, with both the Labor Party and the Liberal Party vying for power. The possibility of a hung parliament, where no single party holds a majority of seats, was seen as a distinct possibility. This would have required the formation of a coalition government between the Labor Party and the independent MPs, or a minority government led by the Labor Party, with the support of the independents.\n\n**Campaign**\n\nThe 2023 election campaign was marked by a series of policy announcements and debates between the leaders of the major parties. The Labor Party campaigned on a platform of increased investment in public services, including healthcare and education, as well as a focus on climate change and renewable energy. The Liberal Party, on the other hand, campaigned on a platform of economic growth and job creation, with a focus on reducing taxes and deregulating industries.\n\n### Policies\n\nThe Labor Party announced several key policies during the campaign, including:\n\n* A $1 billion investment in public hospitals and healthcare services\n* A $500 million investment in schools and education infrastructure\n* A commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2030\n* A plan to increase the minimum wage to $25 per hour\n\nThe Liberal Party also announced several key policies, including:\n\n* A $1.5 billion tax cut for low and middle-income earners\n* A plan to reduce red tape and deregulate industries\n* A commitment to increase the state's economic growth by 3% per annum\n\n### Leaders' debates\n\nThe leaders of the major parties participated in several debates during the campaign, including a televised leaders' debate and a series of regional debates. The debates were widely watched and provided a forum for the leaders to discuss their policies and vision for the state.\n\n**Redistribution**\n\nPrior to the election, the electoral boundaries of New South Wales were redistributed to reflect changes in population and demographic trends. The redistribution resulted in several changes to the electoral boundaries, including the creation of new seats and the abolition of existing ones.\n\n**Registered parties**\n\nThe following parties were registered to contest the election:\n\n* Labor Party\n* Liberal Party of Australia\n* National Party of Australia\n* Greens (New South Wales)\n* Animal Justice Party\n* Shooters, Fishers and Farmers Party\n* Christian Democrats\n* One Nation\n* Climate 200\n* Sustainable Australia Party\n* Transport Workers Party\n\n**Results**\n\n### Legislative Assembly\n\nThe results of the election in the Legislative Assembly were as follows:\n\n* Labor Party: 48 seats\n* Liberal Party of Australia: 25 seats\n* National Party of Australia: 5 seats\n* Independent: 1 seat\n\n### Seats changing hands\n\nSeveral seats changed hands during the election, including:\n\n* The Labor Party gained the seats of:\n\t+ Auburn\n\t+ Bankstown\n\t+ Canterbury\n\t+ East Hills\n\t+ Granville\n\t+ Heffron\n\t+ Holsworthy\n\t+ Ryde\n* The Liberal Party lost the seats of:\n\t+ Auburn\n\t+ Bankstown\n\t+ Canterbury\n\t+ East Hills\n\t+ Granville\n\t+ Heffron\n\t+ Holsworthy\n\t+ Ryde\n\n### Legislative Council\n\nThe results of the election in the Legislative Council were as follows:\n\n* Labor Party: 16 seats\n* Liberal Party of Australia: 12 seats\n* National Party of Australia: 3 seats\n* Greens (New South Wales): 2 seats\n* Shooters, Fishers and Farmers Party: 1 seat\n* Christian Democrats: 1 seat\n* One Nation: 1 seat\n\n**Electoral pendulums**\n\n### Pre-election pendulum\n\nThe pre-election pendulum showed the following seats as being vulnerable to change:\n\n* Auburn (Liberal to Labor)\n* Bankstown (Liberal to Labor)\n* Canterbury (Liberal to Labor)\n* East Hills (Liberal to Labor)\n* Granville (Liberal to Labor)\n* Heffron (Liberal to Labor)\n* Holsworthy (Liberal to Labor)\n* Ryde (Liberal to Labor)\n\n### Post-election pendulum\n\nThe post-election pendulum showed the following seats as being vulnerable to change:\n\n* Auburn (Labor to Liberal)\n* Bankstown (Labor to Liberal)\n* Canterbury (Labor to Liberal)\n* East Hills (Labor to Liberal)\n* Granville (Labor to Liberal)\n* Heffron (Labor to Liberal)\n* Holsworthy (Labor to Liberal)\n* Ryde (Labor to Liberal)\n\n### Notes\n\nThe 2023 election was marked by a high level of voter dissatisfaction with both the Labor Party and the Liberal Party, with many voters expressing disillusionment with the performance of both parties.

Born on August 6, 1962, in Ipoh, Malaysia, she has established herself as a prominent figure in the film industry, known for her versatility and range in a wide variety of roles.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n---------------------------\n\nYeoh was born to Janet Yeoh, a philosophy and language professor, and Yeoh Kian Teik, a lawyer. Her family moved to Penang when she was two years old and later to Kuala Lumpur. Yeoh's early life was marked by a strong interest in dance, particularly ballet. She began training at the age of four and went on to study dance at the prestigious Institute of Dance in Malaysia.\n\nAfter completing her secondary education, Yeoh moved to London to pursue a degree in English literature at the University of East London. However, due to financial constraints, she was forced to drop out and instead worked as a part-time model. Her experiences as a model and dancer laid the foundation for her future career in acting.\n\n**Career**\n---------\n\n### **Early Career and First Retirement (1983–1991)**\n\nYeoh's acting career began in the 1980s, when she started landing small roles in Malaysian television dramas and films. Her breakthrough came in 1983 with the film _Highway to Hell_, a Hong Kong action comedy that showcased her martial arts skills. This led to a string of action films in the late 1980s, including _Yes, Madam_ and _Magnificent Warriors_.\n\nHowever, by the early 1990s, Yeoh began to feel disillusioned with the quality of films she was being offered. She decided to take a break from acting and pursue other interests, including real estate and philanthropy.\n\n### **Return as an Action Star (1992–2001)**\n\nYeoh returned to acting in the early 1990s, signing a contract with the Hong Kong film studio Golden Harvest. Her first film back was the action comedy _Police Story 3: Supercop_, which grossed over $100 million worldwide. This marked the beginning of a successful resurgence in Yeoh's career, with films like _Supercop 2_ and _Tomorrow Never Dies_ cementing her status as a leading action star.\n\nDuring this period, Yeoh also began to explore more dramatic roles, including the critically acclaimed film _Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon_. Her performance earned her widespread recognition and acclaim, both in the East and the West.\n\n### **Career Fluctuations (2002–2016)**\n\nThe early 2000s saw a decline in Yeoh's career, as she struggled to find suitable roles. Despite appearances in films like _The Mummy 3_ and _Kung Fu Panda 2_, she faced a period of relative quiet in the industry.\n\nHowever, Yeoh continued to work, taking on smaller roles and producing films through her own production company, Green House Productions. This period also saw her become more involved in philanthropic work, particularly in the area of women's rights and education.\n\n### **Supporting Roles (2017–2020)**\n\nYeoh's career experienced a resurgence in the late 2010s, with a series of supporting roles in high-profile films. Her performance as a school principal in the film _Crazy Rich Asians_ earned her critical acclaim and recognition from a new audience.\n\nThis was followed by roles in films like _Star Trek: Discovery_ and _Last Christmas_, which saw Yeoh working alongside some of the biggest names in the industry.\n\n### **Award Success (2021–present)**\n\nYeoh's career reached new heights in 2021, with a historic win at the 73rd Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series for her role in _The Crown_. This marked the first time a woman of Asian descent had won in the category.\n\nHer success continued with a nomination for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama at the 94th Academy Awards for her role in _Everything Everywhere All at Once_. Yeoh's performance earned her widespread critical acclaim and recognition as one of the greatest actresses of her generation.\n\n**Activism**\n------------\n\nThroughout her career, Yeoh has been an outspoken advocate for various social causes, including women's rights, education, and environmental conservation. She has worked with organizations such as the United Nations Development Programme and the Asian Development Bank to promote education and economic development in Asia.\n\nYeoh has also been a vocal critic of sexism and racism in the film industry, using her platform to highlight the underrepresentation of women and minority groups in the industry.\n\n**Personal Life**\n----------------\n\nYeoh is married to French horse racing driver and entrepreneur Jean Todt. The couple met in the early 1980s and have been together ever since. Yeoh is a Buddhist and has been open about her spiritual practices and their impact on her life and career.\n\n**Filmography**\n--------------\n\n* _Highway to Hell_ (1983)\n* _Yes, Madam_ (1985)\n* _Magnificent Warriors_ (1987)\n* _Police Story 3: Supercop_ (1992)\n* _Supercop 2_ (1993)\n* _Tomorrow Never Dies_ (1997)\n* _Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon_ (2000)\n* _The Mummy 3_ (2008)\n* _Kung Fu Panda 2_ (2011)\n* _Crazy Rich Asians_ (2018)\n* _Star Trek: Discovery_ (2019)\n* _Last Christmas_ (2019)\n* _Everything Everywhere All at Once_ (2022)\n\n**Accolades**\n------------\n\n### **Honours**\n\nYeoh has been awarded numerous honors and accolades for her contributions to the film industry and her philanthropic work.

This domain includes a vast array of complex life forms, ranging from single-celled protists to multicellular organisms such as animals, plants, and fungi. Eukaryotes are found in almost every habitat on Earth, from the freezing tundra to the hottest deserts, and are a crucial part of the planet's ecosystem.\n\n**Diversity**\n\nEukaryotes exhibit an incredible diversity of form and function, with over 1.4 million described species. This diversity is reflected in the wide range of eukaryotic life forms, including:\n\n* **Protists**: single-celled eukaryotes that lack a cell wall, such as amoebas and paramecia.\n* **Fungi**: multicellular eukaryotes that obtain their nutrients by decomposing organic matter or forming symbiotic relationships with other organisms.\n* **Animals**: multicellular eukaryotes that obtain their nutrients by consuming other organisms.\n* **Plants**: multicellular eukaryotes that produce their own food through photosynthesis.\n\n**Distinguishing features**\n\nEukaryotes have several distinguishing features that set them apart from prokaryotes, which lack a true nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles.\n\n### **Nucleus**\n\nThe nucleus is a membrane-bound organelle that contains the eukaryotic cell's genetic material, or DNA. The nucleus is typically located in the center of the cell and is surrounded by a double membrane called the nuclear envelope. The nucleus is responsible for controlling the cell's growth, metabolism, and reproduction.\n\n### **Biochemistry**\n\nEukaryotes have a complex biochemistry that is characterized by the presence of membrane-bound organelles and a wide range of biochemical pathways. These pathways include glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and fatty acid synthesis, among others. Eukaryotic cells also have a unique set of enzymes and other biomolecules that are involved in the synthesis and degradation of macromolecules.\n\n### **Internal membranes**\n\nEukaryotic cells have a complex system of internal membranes that are involved in a wide range of cellular processes, including protein synthesis, nutrient uptake, and waste removal. These membranes include the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus, and the lysosomes, among others.\n\n### **Mitochondria**\n\nMitochondria are membrane-bound organelles that are responsible for generating energy for the cell through the process of cellular respiration. Mitochondria are found in eukaryotic cells and are thought to have evolved from a group of bacteria that lived inside the cells of early eukaryotes.\n\n### **Plastids**\n\nPlastids are membrane-bound organelles that are responsible for photosynthesis in plants and other eukaryotes. Plastids are thought to have evolved from a group of cyanobacteria that lived inside the cells of early eukaryotes.\n\n### **Cytoskeletal structures**\n\nEukaryotic cells have a complex system of cytoskeletal structures that provide support, shape, and movement to the cell. These structures include microtubules, microfilaments, and intermediate filaments.\n\n### **Cell wall**\n\nEukaryotic cells have a variety of cell walls that provide support and protection to the cell. These cell walls include the cellulosic walls of plant cells, the chitinous walls of fungal cells, and the keratin-based walls of animal cells.\n\n### **Sexual reproduction**\n\nEukaryotes exhibit a wide range of reproductive strategies, including sexual reproduction. Sexual reproduction involves the fusion of two gametes, which results in the formation of a zygote that contains the genetic material of both parents.\n\n**Evolution**\n\nEukaryotes have a complex evolutionary history that dates back over 2 billion years. The earliest eukaryotes were likely single-celled organisms that lived in ancient oceans.\n\n### **History of classification**\n\nThe history of eukaryote classification dates back to the 19th century, when biologists first began to recognize the diversity of eukaryotic life forms. Over the years, eukaryotes have been classified into a variety of different kingdoms and phyla.\n\n### **Phylogeny**\n\nEukaryotes have a complex phylogeny that reflects their evolutionary history. The earliest eukaryotes were likely single-celled organisms that lived in ancient oceans. Over time, these organisms gave rise to a wide range of different eukaryotic lineages, including the animals, plants, and fungi.\n\n### **Origin of eukaryotes**\n\nThe origin of eukaryotes is not well understood, but it is thought to have occurred over 2 billion years ago. One theory is that eukaryotes evolved from a group of bacteria that lived inside the cells of ancient prokaryotes.\n\n### **Fossils**\n\nFossils of eukaryotes date back to the early Cambrian period, over 500 million years ago. These fossils include the remains of ancient plants and animals, as well as the tracks and burrows of eukaryotic organisms.\n\n**See also**\n\n* **Prokaryote**\n* **Cell biology**\n* **Biochemistry**\n* **Evolutionary biology**\n\n**References**\n\n* **None**\n\n**External links**\n\n* **National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)** - a database of eukaryotic genomes and other biological information.\n* **Eukaryote phylogeny** - a comprehensive tree of eukaryotic relationships.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

He is best known for his extensive military campaigns in Wales, Scotland, and France, as well as his significant contributions to the development of the English legal system.\n\n**Early years, 1239–1263**\n\n### Childhood and marriage\n\nEdward was born on June 17, 1239, in Westminster, London, to King Henry III and Eleanor of Provence. As the eldest son of the king, Edward was raised with the expectation of succeeding to the throne. He received a classical education, which included studies in Latin, Greek, and philosophy. In 1254, at the age of 15, Edward married Eleanor of Castile, a member of the royal family of Castile. The marriage was arranged by Edward's father, who saw the union as a way to secure an alliance with the powerful kingdom of Castile.\n\n### Early ambitions\n\nEdward's early years were marked by a desire to prove himself as a capable and ambitious prince. He was known for his military prowess and his ability to lead men in battle. In 1258, Edward participated in the Second Barons' War, a conflict between the English nobility and the crown. Although the war was ultimately unsuccessful, Edward's performance in battle earned him the respect of his contemporaries.\n\n**Civil war and crusades, 1264–1273**\n\n### Second Barons' War\n\nThe Second Barons' War was a conflict between the English nobility and the crown, which began in 1264. Edward, who had become increasingly frustrated with the limitations placed on his power by his father, saw the war as an opportunity to assert his authority. He led a successful campaign against the barons, but the war ultimately ended in defeat for the crown.\n\n### Crusade and accession\n\nIn 1269, Edward participated in the Eighth Crusade, a military campaign led by King Louis IX of France. Although the crusade was ultimately unsuccessful, Edward's participation in the campaign helped to establish him as a capable and brave leader. In 1272, Edward's father, King Henry III, died, and Edward succeeded him as king.\n\n**Early reign, 1274–1296**\n\n### Conquest of Wales\n\nOne of Edward's earliest priorities as king was to conquer Wales, which had long been a thorn in the side of the English crown. In 1277, Edward launched a military campaign against the Welsh, using a combination of force and diplomacy to secure the submission of the Welsh princes. The conquest of Wales was a significant achievement for Edward, and it helped to establish him as a powerful and effective leader.\n\n### Diplomacy and war on the Continent\n\nEdward's early reign was also marked by a series of diplomatic and military campaigns on the Continent. In 1278, he negotiated a treaty with the Holy Roman Emperor, Rudolf of Habsburg, which established a lasting peace between the two powers. However, Edward's military campaigns in Scotland and France were ultimately unsuccessful, and he was forced to conclude a peace treaty with the Scots in 1295.\n\n### Great Cause\n\nThe Great Cause was a series of legal proceedings that took place in 1292, in which Edward sought to establish his claim to the throne of Scotland. The proceedings were ultimately unsuccessful, and Edward's claim to the throne was rejected by the Scottish nobles.\n\n**Government and law**\n\n### Character as king\n\nEdward was known for his strong personality and his ability to assert his authority as king. He was a firm believer in the power of the crown, and he was willing to use force to assert his will. However, he was also a just and fair ruler, and he took great care to ensure that the law was upheld in his kingdom.\n\n### Administration and the law\n\nEdward's administration was marked by a series of significant reforms, including the establishment of a new system of taxation and the creation of a centralized court system. He also took steps to improve the administration of justice, including the establishment of a new system of trial by jury.\n\n### Finances and Parliament\n\nEdward's finances were in a precarious state when he came to power, and he was forced to establish a new system of taxation to pay for his military campaigns. In 1295, he summoned the first English Parliament, which consisted of representatives from the nobility and the clergy. The Parliament was a significant achievement for Edward, and it helped to establish him as a powerful and effective leader.\n\n### Parliament and the expulsion of the Jews\n\nIn 1290, Edward issued a royal edict expelling all Jews from England. The edict was a response to growing anti-Semitism in the kingdom, and it marked a significant turning point in the history of the English Jews.\n\n### Administration in Ireland\n\nEdward's administration in Ireland was marked by a series of significant reforms, including the establishment of a new system of taxation and the creation of a centralized court system. He also took steps to improve the administration of justice, including the establishment of a new system of trial by jury.\n\n**Later reign, 1297–1307**\n\n### Constitutional crisis\n\nIn 1297, Edward faced a constitutional crisis when his nobles refused to recognize his authority as king. The crisis was ultimately resolved through a series of compromises, including the establishment of a new system of taxation and the creation of a centralized court system.\n\n### Return to Scotland\n\nIn 1300, Edward launched a military campaign against the Scots, which was ultimately unsuccessful. He was forced to conclude a peace treaty with the Scots in 1305.\n\n### Death and burial\n\nEdward died on July 7, 1307, at Burgh-by-Sands, near Carlisle. He was buried in Westminster Abbey, where many of his predecessors had also been laid to rest.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nEdward's legacy is complex and multifaceted. He is remembered as a powerful and effective leader who played a significant role in the development of the English monarchy. He also established a new system of taxation and created a centralized court system, which helped to establish the English crown as a powerful and authoritative institution. However, he is also remembered for his role in the expulsion of the Jews and his aggressive military campaigns, which had a significant impact on the people of Scotland and Wales.\n\n**Family**\n\n### First marriage\n\nEdward's first marriage was to Eleanor of Castile, a member of the royal family of Castile. The marriage was arranged by Edward's father, who saw the union as a way to secure an alliance with the powerful kingdom of Castile.\n\n### Second marriage\n\nEdward's second marriage was to Margaret of France, a member of the royal family of France. The marriage was arranged by Edward's advisors, who saw the union as a way to secure an alliance with the powerful kingdom of France.\n\n### Genealogical table\n\nEdward's family tree is as follows:\n\n* Parents: King Henry III and Eleanor of Provence\n* Spouses:\n\t+ Eleanor of Castile (married 1254, died 1290)\n\t+ Margaret of France (married 1299, died 1305)\n* Children:\n\t+ Edward of Carnarvon (born 1284, died 1327)\n\t+ Thomas of Brotherton (born 1300, died 1338)\n\t+ Joan of Acre (born 1272, died 1307)\n\n**See also**\n\n* Edward I of England in popular culture\n* List of English monarchs\n* List of monarchs of the House of Plantagenet\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is based on a number of primary and secondary sources, including the works of historians such as Francis C.

The election was the 6th parliamentary election held since the fall of communism in Hungary and the 5th since the country's accession to the European Union.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe 2022 Hungarian parliamentary election was marked by significant changes to the electoral law and the opposition's efforts to present a united front against the ruling Fidesz party.\n\n### **Amendment of the electoral law**\n\nIn 2021, the Hungarian parliament passed an amendment to the electoral law, which introduced significant changes to the electoral system. The amendment reduced the number of single-member constituencies from 106 to 106, and introduced a system of proportional representation for the remaining seats. The amendment was widely criticized by the opposition, who argued that it was designed to favor the ruling Fidesz party.\n\n### **Creation of joint opposition list**\n\nIn response to the changes to the electoral law, the opposition parties in Hungary decided to present a joint list in the election. The joint list, known as the \"United Opposition,\" was formed by six opposition parties: the Democratic Coalition, the Hungarian Socialist Party, the green LMP party, the Dialogue party, the Momentum Movement, and the previously illegal, but since 2021 legal again, Jobbik party. The joint list was seen as a key factor in the opposition's hopes of defeating the ruling Fidesz party.\n\n### **Opposition primary**\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the election, the opposition parties in Hungary held a series of primary elections to determine the order of candidates on the joint list. The primaries were seen as an important step in consolidating the opposition's efforts and presenting a united front against the ruling Fidesz party.\n\n**Electoral system**\n\nThe 2022 Hungarian parliamentary election used a mixed-member system, in which 106 single-member constituencies elected one member each, and the remaining 93 seats were allocated using proportional representation.\n\n**Parties and coalitions**\n\nThe main parties and coalitions in the 2022 Hungarian parliamentary election were:\n\n* **Fidesz-KDNP**: The ruling coalition, led by the Fidesz party and the Christian Democratic People's Party.\n* **United Opposition**: A joint list of six opposition parties, including the Democratic Coalition, the Hungarian Socialist Party, the green LMP party, the Dialogue party, the Momentum Movement, and the Jobbik party.\n\n**Opinion polls**\n\nOpinion polls conducted in the weeks leading up to the election showed a tight race between the ruling Fidesz party and the opposition. However, the polls also showed that the opposition was gaining momentum, and that the ruling party's lead was narrowing.\n\n**Results**\n\nThe 2022 Hungarian parliamentary election was held on 3 April 2022. The results were as follows:\n\n### **Result by constituency**\n\nThe opposition won a narrow majority of seats in the single-member constituencies, taking 47 seats to the ruling party's 43.\n\n### **Party list results by county and in the diaspora**\n\nThe party list results by county and in the diaspora showed a surprising level of support for the opposition in some areas. The opposition won a majority of the party list seats in several counties, including Pest, Szabolcs-Szatmár-Bereg, and Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe 2022 Hungarian parliamentary election was widely seen as a significant event in Hungarian politics. The opposition's narrow victory was seen as a major upset, and a significant challenge to the ruling Fidesz party's dominance.\n\n### **Analysis**\n\nThe opposition's victory was seen as a result of several factors, including the joint list, the opposition primary, and the changing mood of the electorate. The election also highlighted the ongoing polarisation of Hungarian politics, with the ruling party and the opposition showing little signs of compromise or cooperation.\n\n### **Conduct**\n\nThe 2022 Hungarian parliamentary election was seen as a well-conducted election, with few reports of irregularities or electoral crimes. The election was overseen by the National Election Commission, which was widely praised for its professionalism and impartiality.\n\n### **Anomalies over postal ballots**\n\nThere were some reports of anomalies over postal ballots in the election, including allegations of voter intimidation and electoral fraud. However, these allegations were not substantiated, and the National Election Commission investigated and rejected most of them.\n\n### **International responses**\n\nThe international community responded to the 2022 Hungarian parliamentary election with a mix of congratulations and criticism. The European Union welcomed the opposition's victory, but also expressed concerns about the ongoing polarisation of Hungarian politics. The United States also welcomed the election, but urged the new government to respect human rights and democratic norms.\n\n**See also**\n\n* 2022 Hungarian local elections\n* 2020 Hungarian parliamentary election\n* 2018 Hungarian parliamentary election\n* Hungarian parliamentary election, 2014\n* Hungarian parliamentary election, 2010\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article incorporates content from the original Wikipedia article, which is released under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.\n* The text has been modified to conform to Wikipedia's neutral point of view policy and to ensure consistency with the style and tone of Wikipedia articles.\n\n**References**\n\nThis article does not include any references.

At its core, open science emphasizes the collaborative and transparent sharing of knowledge, data, and methods. The economics of open science involves the study of the costs, benefits, and regulatory frameworks that shape the production, dissemination, and use of scientific knowledge in this new paradigm.\n\n**Economic Models**\n\nOne key aspect of the economics of open science is the development of new economic models that reflect the changing nature of scientific research and knowledge production.\n\n### **Open Science Club**\n\nThe open science club is a conceptual framework that describes the benefits of open science in terms of knowledge sharing and collaboration. In this framework, researchers and scientists are seen as members of a club, where the benefits of membership (e.g., access to knowledge, collaboration, and recognition) are shared among club members.\n\n#### **Definitions of Knowledge Club**\n\nThe concept of the knowledge club is rooted in the idea of clubs as institutions that facilitate cooperation and coordination among their members. In the context of open science, the knowledge club is defined as a group of individuals who share a common interest in advancing scientific knowledge and who work together to achieve this goal.\n\n#### **Knowledge Club and Open Science**\n\nThe knowledge club and open science are closely intertwined concepts. The open science club is a manifestation of the knowledge club, where the benefits of membership (e.g., access to knowledge, collaboration, and recognition) are shared among club members. The open science club promotes the principles of open science, such as transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration, which are essential for advancing scientific knowledge.\n\n### **Open Science Market**\n\nThe open science market is a hybrid market that combines elements of traditional publishing and open access models. In this market, scientific knowledge is produced and disseminated through various channels, including traditional publishing, open access journals, and preprint servers.\n\n#### **Scientific Publishing: a Hybrid Market**\n\nThe scientific publishing market is characterized by a hybrid model, where traditional publishing (e.g., subscription-based journals) coexists with open access models (e.g., article processing charges). This model allows researchers to choose between traditional publishing and open access options, depending on their needs and preferences.\n\n#### **From Readers to Authors: Hybrid and Full Open Access**\n\nThe shift from readers to authors in the open science market reflects the changing nature of scientific publishing. With the rise of open access models, authors now have more control over the dissemination of their work, and readers have greater access to the latest research findings.\n\n#### **From Publishing to Analytics: Diversification of Revenue Streams**\n\nThe open science market has led to the diversification of revenue streams for scientific publishing. With the rise of analytics and data-driven publishing, publishers can now generate revenue through metrics and data, in addition to traditional advertising and subscription models.\n\n### **Open Science Commons**\n\nThe open science commons is a digital knowledge commons that allows researchers to share and collaborate on research findings, data, and methods.\n\n#### **The Emergence of Digital Knowledge Commons**\n\nThe open science commons emerged as a response to the need for a digital platform that facilitates the sharing and collaboration of research findings. This platform allows researchers to share their work, collaborate with others, and access the latest research findings.\n\n#### **Enclosures of Open Science Commons**\n\nThe open science commons is not without its challenges. Enclosures, such as copyright and licensing restrictions, can limit access to research findings and hinder collaboration.\n\n#### **Consolidation of the Common Ecosystem (2015-)**\n\nThe consolidation of the open science commons ecosystem has led to the development of new platforms and tools that facilitate the sharing and collaboration of research findings.\n\n**Cost**\n\nThe economics of open science also involves the study of the costs associated with this paradigm.\n\n## **Editorial Work and Evaluation**\n\nEditorial work and evaluation are essential components of the open science paradigm. Researchers and editors work together to ensure that research findings are accurate, reliable, and of high quality.\n\n## **Technical Infrastructure**\n\nThe technical infrastructure for open science includes the development and maintenance of platforms, tools, and software that facilitate the sharing and collaboration of research findings.\n\n## **Commercial Services and Prestige**\n\nCommercial services and prestige are also important considerations in the economics of open science. Researchers and institutions may need to pay for services, such as editing and formatting, and prestige may be associated with high-quality publications and recognition.\n\n**Benefits**\n\nThe benefits of open science are numerous and well-documented.\n\n## **Transaction Costs**\n\nTransaction costs, such as the costs of searching for and accessing research findings, are reduced in the open science paradigm.\n\n## **Access Costs**\n\nAccess costs, such as the costs of accessing research findings, are also reduced in the open science paradigm.\n\n## **Research Efficiency**\n\nResearch efficiency is improved in the open science paradigm, as researchers can more easily access and build upon existing research findings.\n\n## **Economic and Social Development**\n\nEconomic and social development are also promoted through the open science paradigm, as research findings are more widely disseminated and utilized.\n\n**Economic Regulation of Open Science**\n\nThe economic regulation of open science involves the development of policies and frameworks that promote the principles of open science.\n\n**References**\n\nThis article is a comprehensive overview of the economics of open science, covering the key concepts, models, and benefits of this paradigm. The article has provided a detailed discussion of the open science club, open science market, open science commons, costs, and benefits of open science, as well as the economic regulation of this paradigm.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

He grew up in Brooklyn, where he attended Lafayette High School. Koufax developed an interest in baseball at an early age and was a standout player on his high school team. He was drafted by the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1954, but chose to attend UCLA instead, where he played college baseball.\n\n**Major League tryouts**\n\nKoufax made his major league debut on June 11, 1955, for the Brooklyn Dodgers.

He was sent to the minor leagues in 1956, where he spent two seasons refining his skills. In 1958, Koufax returned to the major leagues, but still struggled to find consistency. He went 11-15 with a 4.58 ERA in 1959, but improved to 11-13 with a 3.52 ERA in 1960.\n\n**Domination (1961-1964)**\n\nKoufax's career took off in 1961, when he went 18-13 with a 2.54 ERA.

In 1963, Koufax went 25-5 with a 1.88 ERA, throwing 16 complete games and earning his third All-Star selection. He also threw two no-hitters that season.\n\n**1961 season**\n\nKoufax's 1961 season was a breakout year. He went 18-13 with a 2.54 ERA, throwing 19 complete games and pitching in 38 games. He earned his first All-Star selection and was named the National League's Rookie of the Year. Koufax's performance that season helped the Dodgers win the National League pennant.\n\n**1962 season**\n\nKoufax's 1962 season was even better than his 1961 season. He went 21-9 with a 2.54 ERA, throwing 18 complete games and pitching in 39 games. He earned his second All-Star selection and was named the National League's Cy Young Award winner. Koufax's performance that season helped the Dodgers win the National League pennant.\n\n**1963 season**\n\nKoufax's 1963 season was his best yet. He went 25-5 with a 1.88 ERA, throwing 16 complete games and pitching in 41 games.

He was seeking a $125,000 salary, but the team offered him $100,000. Koufax refused to sign a contract, and the team was forced to void his contract.

He did not appear in a single postseason game that season.\n\n**Playing in pain (1965-66)**\n\nKoufax suffered an injury in the 1965 season, which limited his effectiveness on the mound. He went 11-8 with a 1.73 ERA, throwing 5 complete games and pitching in 29 games. In 1966, Koufax was limited to 11 starts, going 8-1 with a 1.73 ERA.\n\n**1965 season**\n\nKoufax's 1965 season was his best yet.

The perfect game was a masterpiece, with Koufax striking out 10 batters and facing the minimum 27 batters.\n\n**World Series and Yom Kippur decision**\n\nKoufax's 1965 season ended with a World Series appearance.

However, he was pulled from the game in the 8th inning and the Dodgers eventually lost the game 8-0. Koufax declined to pitch in Game 5 of the World Series, citing his Jewish faith and the observance of Yom Kippur. The Dodgers eventually lost the World Series 4-3.\n\n**Holdout**\n\nIn 1966, Koufax became embroiled in a holdout dispute with the Dodgers. He was seeking a $100,000 signing bonus, but the team offered him $75,000. Koufax refused to sign a contract, and the team was forced to void his contract. The dispute lasted for several weeks, but eventually, Koufax and the Dodgers reached a settlement.\n\n**1966 season**\n\nKoufax's 1966 season was his last.
