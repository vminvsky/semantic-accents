Born on December 8, 1970, in Dublin, Ireland, O'Connor rose to international fame in the late 1980s and has since become known for her powerful voice, provocative lyrics, and unapologetic activism.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nSinéad O'Connor was born to Sean O'Connor, a musician and architect, and Joan O'Connor, a photographer and artist. Her father was a traditional Irish musician, and O'Connor credits him with introducing her to music from a young age. O'Connor's family moved frequently during her childhood, eventually settling in Dublin's city center. She attended Mount Anville College in Dublin and later moved to London, where she attended Notre Dame High School. O'Connor's early life was marked by a deep connection to her Catholic faith and a strong sense of social justice.\n\n**Music Career**\n\n#### 1980s\n\nSinéad O'Connor's music career began in the early 1980s, performing in local clubs and bars in Dublin. She released her first single, \"I Want Your (Hands on Me),\" in 1987, which gained modest success. However, it was her debut album, _The Lion and the Cobra_ (1987), that brought her to international attention.\n\n#### 1987–1989: The Lion and the Cobra\n\n_The Lion and the Cobra_ was a critically acclaimed album that combined traditional Irish folk influences with modern rock and pop. The album's lead single, \"Mandinka,\" became a hit in several countries, including the UK, where it reached number 3 on the charts. O'Connor's unique voice and poignant lyrics resonated with audiences, and she quickly gained a loyal following.\n\n#### 1990–1993: I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got\n\n_O'Connor's second album, I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got_ (1990), was a commercial and critical success. The album's lead single, \"Nothing Compares 2 U,\" became an international hit, reaching number 1 in several countries, including the US, where it stayed at the top of the Billboard Hot 100 chart for four weeks.

During the performance, O'Connor tore up a photograph of Pope John Paul II, sparking controversy and outrage. The incident sparked a heated debate about censorship, free speech, and the role of artists in society.\n\n#### 1993–2000\n\nThe 1990s were marked by a period of creative experimentation and personal turmoil for O'Connor. She released several albums, including _Am I Not Your Girl?_ (1992), _Universal Mother_ (1995), and _Faith and Courage_ (1999). O'Connor's music continued to evolve, incorporating elements of folk, rock, and electronic music. However, her personal life was marred by struggles with depression, anxiety, and addiction.\n\n#### 2000s\n\nIn the 2000s, O'Connor released several albums, including _She Who Dwells in the Secret of the Most High_ (2002), _Throw Down Your Arms_ (2005), and _Theology II: Something More Beyond_ (2008).

O'Connor has since become an advocate for mental health awareness and suicide prevention.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\n#### Marriages and children\n\nSinéad O'Connor has been married four times: to John Reynolds (1987-1988), to Nicholas Hughes (2001-2002), to Barry Herridge (2010-2011), and to Donal Lunny (2011-2012).

It is a member of the genus Torreya, which is characterized by its distinctive, twisted trunks and aromatic foliage.\n\n**Species discovery**\n\nTorreya taxifolia was first discovered by European-American botanist John Torrey in 1825. Torrey, a professor of botany at New York University, was on an expedition to the southeastern United States to collect plant specimens. He encountered the tree in the Apalachicola National Forest, in what is now Bay County, Florida.\n\n**Taxonomy and naming**\n\nTorreya taxifolia is a member of the genus Torreya, which is part of the family Taxaceae. The genus Torreya is characterized by its unique, twisted trunks and aromatic foliage. The species was named by Torrey himself, who gave it the binomial name Torreya taxifolia. The name \"taxifolia\" is derived from the Latin words \"taxus,\" meaning \"yew,\" and \"folia,\" meaning \"leaves.\"\n\n**Type species of genus Torreya**\n\nTorreya taxifolia was designated as the type species of the genus Torreya by Torrey himself. The type species is the species that is used to define the characteristics of the genus. In the case of Torreya taxifolia, it is the species that is used to define the distinctive twisted trunks and aromatic foliage of the genus.\n\n**Common names**\n\nTorreya taxifolia is commonly known by several names, including the Florida nutmeg, Florida torreya, and the Florida red cedar. The name \"nutmeg\" comes from the fact that the tree's seeds have a strong, nutmeg-like aroma. The name \"red cedar\" comes from the tree's distinctive, reddish-brown bark.\n\n**Description**\n\n**Technical description**\n\nTorreya taxifolia is a large tree, growing up to 80 feet (24 meters) in height. Its trunk is characterized by its distinctive, twisted shape, with a diameter of up to 3 feet (90 cm). The tree's foliage is aromatic, with needle-like leaves that are up to 1 inch (2.5 cm) long. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by small, red cones in the summer.\n\n**Subcanopy growth adaptations**\n\nTorreya taxifolia has several adaptations that allow it to grow in the subcanopy, where the tree receives filtered sunlight. The tree's leaves are adapted to absorb the limited sunlight available in the subcanopy, and its roots are able to grow deeper into the soil to access water and nutrients. The tree's twisted trunk also allows it to grow in a way that maximizes its exposure to sunlight.\n\n**Distribution**\n\n**Wild population**\n\nTorreya taxifolia is found in the wild only in the southeastern United States, specifically in the states of Florida and Georgia. The tree is found in the Apalachicola National Forest, the Ocala National Forest, and other protected areas.\n\n**Prehistoric distribution**\n\nFossil evidence suggests that Torreya taxifolia was once found in a wider range of habitats, including the southeastern United States and the Caribbean. The tree's prehistoric distribution is thought to have been influenced by changes in climate and sea levels.\n\n**Ecology**\n\n**Habitat**\n\nTorreya taxifolia is found in a variety of habitats, including forests, swamps, and wetlands. The tree prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade.\n\n**Seed dispersal**\n\nTorreya taxifolia produces small, red cones that contain seeds. The seeds are dispersed by wind and water, and are also eaten by animals such as birds and small mammals.\n\n**Extinction threats**\n\n**Vulnerabilities of restricted range size**\n\nTorreya taxifolia is vulnerable to extinction due to its restricted range size. The tree is found in a small area of the southeastern United States, and is dependent on a specific set of environmental conditions.\n\n**The die-off begins**\n\nIn the late 19th century, Torreya taxifolia began to die off in large numbers. The exact cause of the die-off is still unknown, but it is thought to have been influenced by a combination of factors, including habitat destruction, disease, and insect infestation.\n\n**The role of pathogens in the die-off**\n\nPathogens, such as fungi and bacteria, are thought to have played a significant role in the die-off of Torreya taxifolia. The tree is susceptible to a variety of pathogens, including those that cause canker and leaf blight.\n\n**The role of habitat deterioration in the die-off**\n\nHabitat deterioration is also thought to have contributed to the die-off of Torreya taxifolia. The tree's habitat is being degraded by human activities such as logging, agriculture, and urbanization.\n\n**Focus on a stem canker fungus**\n\nOne of the pathogens that is thought to have contributed to the die-off of Torreya taxifolia is a stem canker fungus. The fungus causes a canker-like growth on the tree's trunk, which can be fatal to the tree.\n\n**Ultimate cause of die-off still unsolved**\n\nDespite extensive research, the ultimate cause of the die-off of Torreya taxifolia is still unknown. It is thought to have been influenced by a combination of factors, including habitat destruction, disease, and insect infestation.\n\n**Conservation actions**\n\n**Protect areas in species range**\n\nConservation efforts are underway to protect the remaining habitat of Torreya taxifolia. This includes the establishment of protected areas, such as national forests and wildlife refuges.\n\n**List the species as endangered**\n\nTorreya taxifolia has been listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). This listing recognizes the tree's vulnerability to extinction and the need for conservation efforts.\n\n**In situ habitat improvement**\n\nConservation efforts are also focused on improving the tree's habitat in situ. This includes the removal of invasive species, the protection of water sources, and the restoration of degraded habitats.\n\n**Ex situ genetic safeguarding**\n\nEx situ genetic safeguarding involves the collection and conservation of Torreya taxifolia seeds and seedlings in controlled environments, such as botanical gardens and nurseries. This allows for the preservation of the tree's genetic diversity and the potential for reintroduction into the wild.\n\n**Document early horticultural plantings**\n\nEarly horticultural plantings of Torreya taxifolia have been documented, including those in the United States and Europe. These plantings provide a record of the tree's early history and its introduction to new regions.\n\n**Conservation controversies**\n\n**Assisted migration (the policy debate)**\n\nOne of the conservation controversies surrounding Torreya taxifolia is the debate over assisted migration. This involves the intentional introduction of the tree into new regions, such as areas outside of its native range. Proponents argue that this can help to prevent extinction and promote the tree's survival, while opponents argue that it can disrupt ecosystems and introduce non-native species.\n\n**Management of seeds produced ex situ**\n\nThe management of seeds produced ex situ is another conservation controversy surrounding Torreya taxifolia. This involves the collection and conservation of seeds produced in controlled environments, such as botanical gardens and nurseries. Some argue that this can help to preserve the tree's genetic diversity and provide a source of seeds for reintroduction into the wild, while others argue that it can lead to the spread of invasive species and the loss of native genetic material.\n\n###Seeds produced from official plantings\n\nSeeds produced from official plantings are those that are collected from trees that have been planted in controlled environments, such as botanical gardens and nurseries. These seeds are often used for conservation and research purposes.\n\n###Seeds accessed by citizens\n\nSeeds accessed by citizens are those that are collected from trees that have been planted in private gardens and landscapes. These seeds are often used for personal purposes, such as planting new trees or propagating the species.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

It is native to the Mediterranean region, Western Asia, and parts of Eastern Europe. The plant has a complex relationship with its environment and is known for its unique adaptations to growth, pollination, and seed dispersal.\n\nDistribution\n------------\n\nAnagyris foetida is widely distributed across the Mediterranean region, including countries such as Spain, France, Italy, Greece, Turkey, and Israel. It is also found in parts of Eastern Europe, including Bulgaria, Romania, and Ukraine. The plant thrives in areas with mild winters and hot, dry summers.\n\nHabitat\n--------\n\nAnagyris foetida grows in a variety of habitats, including dry scrublands, rocky outcrops, and coastal areas. It is often found on poor soils and can tolerate a range of pH levels. The plant can grow up to 1 meter in height and has a spreading habit, forming dense colonies.\n\nAdaptations to growth in Winter and early Spring\n------------------------------------------------\n\n### Summer leaf-fall\n\nAnagyris foetida has a unique adaptation to survive harsh winters. In the summer months, the plant produces leaves that are rich in nitrogen and other nutrients. These leaves are shed in the autumn, allowing the plant to conserve water and energy during the winter months. The leaves are also rich in chemical compounds that help to deter herbivores.\n\n### Pollination by birds\n\nAnagyris foetida is pollinated by birds, which visit the plant's flowers to feed on nectar. The flowers are rich in nectar and are a favorite of birds such as honey-eaters and sunbirds. The plant's unique pollination strategy relies on the birds to transfer pollen between flowers, allowing for successful seed set.\n\nSeed dispersal\n--------------\n\nAnagyris foetida disperses its seeds through a variety of mechanisms.\n\n### Soil seed banks\n\nThe plant's seeds are able to survive in the soil for many years, forming a soil seed bank. This allows the plant to maintain a persistent presence in the environment, even if the above-ground vegetation is disturbed or destroyed.\n\n### Olive mimicry\n\nAnagyris foetida seeds have a unique shape and color that allows them to mimic the seeds of the olive tree (Olea europaea). This mimicry helps to protect the seeds from herbivores and other seed predators that target olive seeds.\n\n### Role of sheep\n\nSheep are known to play a significant role in the dispersal of Anagyris foetida seeds. The seeds are able to adhere to the sheep's fleece, allowing them to be transported to new areas where they can germinate and establish new plants.\n\n### Other possible mammalian and avian vectors\n\nIn addition to sheep, other mammals and birds may also play a role in the dispersal of Anagyris foetida seeds. These include rodents, such as mice and rats, as well as birds such as jackdaws and rooks.\n\n### Unknown seed dispersal vector\n\nThere may be other, unknown vectors that play a role in the dispersal of Anagyris foetida seeds. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms of seed dispersal for this plant.\n\n### Tough, waterproof seed coats\n\nAnagyris foetida seeds have a tough, waterproof seed coat that helps to protect them from environmental stresses such as drought and extreme temperatures. This allows the seeds to survive for extended periods of time, even in harsh environments.\n\nValue as a nitrogen-fixing pioneer and companion plant\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnagyris foetida is a nitrogen-fixing plant that plays an important role in maintaining soil fertility. It is often used as a pioneer plant, helping to establish new communities and promote soil health. The plant's nitrogen-fixing ability makes it a valuable companion plant for other crops, helping to improve soil fertility and promote healthy plant growth.\n\nMedicinal use\n-------------\n\nAnagyris foetida has been used in traditional medicine for a variety of purposes, including the treatment of digestive issues and inflammation.

The company has gained international recognition for its innovative submersibles and its contributions to deep-sea exploration.\n\n**Background**\nThe concept of OceanGate began to take shape in the early 2000s, with a focus on providing cutting-edge submersible technology for various applications, including scientific research, tourism, and commercial exploration. The company's founders were driven by a passion for innovation and a commitment to pushing the boundaries of what is possible in the field of submersible design and operation.\n\n**History**\n\n### 2009–2013: Founding and acquisition of Antipodes\n\nOceanGate was founded in 2009 by Stockton Rush, a seasoned entrepreneur and adventurer, who had a vision for creating a company that would revolutionize the submersible industry. Initially, the company focused on developing and acquiring existing submersible designs, with the goal of refining and improving their performance. One of the first major acquisitions was the Antipodes submersible, which was a state-of-the-art vessel at the time. The acquisition of Antipodes marked a significant milestone for OceanGate, providing the company with a solid foundation for future growth and development.\n\n### 2013–2016: Construction of Cyclops and Söhnlein's departure\n\nFollowing the successful acquisition of Antipodes, OceanGate began to focus on developing its own in-house submersible designs. One of the company's most notable projects during this period was the construction of Cyclops 1, a cutting-edge submersible designed to operate in extreme environments. However, the project was not without its challenges, and in 2016, OceanGate's CEO, Stockton Rush, faced a significant setback when the company's lead engineer, Söhnlein, left the company. Despite this setback, Rush remained committed to the project, and Cyclops 1 eventually became one of the company's flagship submersibles.\n\n### 2016–2023: Expansion of fleet and dives to the Titanic\n\nThe 2016–2023 period marked a significant turning point for OceanGate, as the company expanded its fleet of submersibles and established itself as a leader in the field of deep-sea exploration. One of the company's most notable achievements during this period was the completion of several dives to the Titanic wreck site. The dives, which were conducted in partnership with various scientific organizations, provided valuable insights into the history and ecology of the Titanic site. The success of these dives marked a significant milestone for OceanGate, demonstrating the company's capabilities and expertise in operating in extreme environments.\n\n### 2023: Implosion of Titan and death of Rush\n\nIn 2023, OceanGate suffered a devastating setback when one of its submersibles, Titan, imploded during a dive to the Titanic wreck site. The incident resulted in the loss of the submersible and the death of OceanGate's CEO, Stockton Rush. The incident marked a significant blow to the company, but it has since announced plans to continue operating and exploring new frontiers.\n\n**Submersibles**\n\nOceanGate has designed and operated several submersibles over the years, each with its unique capabilities and features. Some of the company's most notable submersibles include:\n\n### Antipodes\n\nThe Antipodes is a state-of-the-art submersible that was acquired by OceanGate in 2009. The vessel is designed to operate in extreme environments and has a depth rating of up to 500 meters.\n\n### Cyclops 1\n\nCyclops 1 is a cutting-edge submersible designed by OceanGate. The vessel is capable of operating in extreme environments and has a depth rating of up to 600 meters.\n\n### Titan\n\nTitan is a state-of-the-art submersible designed by OceanGate. The vessel is designed to operate in extreme environments and has a depth rating of up to 4000 meters.\n\n**Associated entities**\n\nOceanGate has collaborated with various organizations and entities over the years, including:\n\n* The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution\n* The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)\n* The National Geographic Society\n* The Titanic International Association\n\n**See also**\n\n* Deep-sea exploration\n* Submersibles\n* Oceanography\n* Titanic wreck site\n\n**References**\n\nThis article does not include any references.\n\n**Further reading**\n\n* OceanGate's website\n* Stockton Rush's biography\n* The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution's website\n\n**External links**\n\n* OceanGate's website\n* The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution's website\n* The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s website", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

Russia, under the leadership of President Boris Yeltsin, initially recognized Ukraine's independence but later sought to exert influence over its neighbor through economic and diplomatic means.\n\n### Ukrainian Revolution, Russian Intervention in Crimea and Donbas\n\nIn 2013, Ukraine underwent a series of protests and demonstrations, known as the Euromaidan, which led to the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych and the establishment of a new government. Russia responded by annexing Crimea in March 2014, following a referendum in which the majority of Crimean residents voted to join Russia. Russia also supported separatist groups in the Donbas region, leading to a conflict between Ukrainian government forces and Russian-backed rebels.\n\n**Prelude**\n\n### Putin's Invasion Announcement\n\nOn 21 February 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a \"special military operation\" in Ukraine, citing concerns over NATO expansion and Ukraine's treatment of Russian-speaking minorities.

His father, Juan Torres, was a farmer and his mother, Ana Quevedo, was a homemaker. Torres Quevedo received his primary education in Villahormes and later moved to Logroño to attend the local secondary school. He demonstrated a keen interest in mathematics and science from an early age and was particularly drawn to the works of Euclid and Archimedes.\n\nIn 1871, Torres Quevedo enrolled in the University of Zaragoza, where he studied mathematics, physics, and chemistry. He graduated with a degree in mathematics in 1875 and began his career as a teacher at the University of Zaragoza. During this period, he became interested in the works of Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace, which sparked his interest in the development of mechanical computing machines.\n\n**Career**\n\n**Cableways**\n\nIn the late 1880s, Torres Quevedo began to work on the design and development of cableways, a type of cable-powered transportation system. His designs were influenced by the works of Gustave Eiffel and were intended to improve the efficiency and safety of cableway systems. Torres Quevedo's cableway designs were used in various locations, including the Pyrenees Mountains, and were considered to be among the most advanced of their time.\n\n**Analogue calculating machines**\n\nTorres Quevedo's interest in mechanical computing machines led him to design and build several analogue calculating machines, including the \"Torres Quevedo Machine\". These machines used a combination of gears, levers, and pulleys to perform mathematical calculations and were intended to be more efficient and accurate than traditional mechanical calculators. While these machines were not widely adopted, they represented an important step in the development of mechanical computing machines.\n\n**Aerostatics**\n\nIn the early 1900s, Torres Quevedo became interested in aerostatics, the study of gases and their behavior in relation to the surrounding environment. He designed and built a series of aerostatic engines, which were intended to be used in aircraft and other applications. Torres Quevedo's work in aerostatics was recognized by the French Academy of Sciences, which awarded him a prize for his contributions to the field.\n\n**Radio control: the Telekino**\n\nIn the 1910s, Torres Quevedo became fascinated with the concept of radio control, which involved using radio waves to control mechanical devices remotely. He designed and built the \"Telekino\", a radio-controlled boat that could be operated from a remote location. Torres Quevedo's work in radio control was recognized by the International Radio Exhibition in Paris, which awarded him a gold medal for his invention.\n\n**Formal language**\n\nTorres Quevedo was also interested in formal language, the study of the syntax and semantics of languages. He developed a formal language, known as the \"Torres Quevedo Language\", which was intended to be used in the development of mechanical computing machines. While this language was not widely adopted, it represented an important step in the development of formal language theory.\n\n**Laboratory of Automation**\n\nIn the 1920s, Torres Quevedo founded the Laboratory of Automation, a research institution dedicated to the study and development of mechanical computing machines and other automation technologies. The laboratory was a hub of activity, attracting researchers and engineers from around the world who were interested in the development of automation technologies.

The monastery has a rich history dating back to the 11th century and has been a significant cultural and spiritual center in the region. The monastery's architecture is a blend of Byzantine and Ukrainian styles, with a distinctive golden dome that has become an iconic symbol of Kiev.\n\n**#History**\n\n###**Early years**\n\nThe history of St. Michael's Monastery begins in 1108, when a small wooden church was built on the site. The church was dedicated to the Archangel Michael and was initially a small, unassuming structure. However, over the centuries, the church underwent numerous transformations and expansions, reflecting the changing fortunes of the city and the monastery.\n\n###**16th–17th centuries**\n\nIn the 16th century, the monastery underwent a significant transformation under the patronage of the Rzeczpospolita, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The monastery's architecture was influenced by Polish and Ukrainian styles, resulting in a unique blend of Byzantine and Baroque elements. The monastery's golden dome, which has become a symbol of Kiev, was first introduced during this period.\n\n###**18th century**\n\nDuring the 18th century, the monastery continued to grow in importance, with the establishment of a seminary and a printing press. The monastery's library became a significant center of learning, housing a vast collection of manuscripts and books. The monastery's architecture continued to evolve, with the addition of new buildings and the renovation of existing ones.\n\n###**19th century**\n\nIn the 19th century, the monastery underwent a significant transformation under the patronage of the Russian Empire. The monastery's architecture was influenced by Russian and Byzantine styles, resulting in a more grandiose and imposing structure. The monastery's golden dome was renovated and its interior was decorated with intricate mosaics and frescoes.\n\n###**20th century**\n\nDuring the 20th century, the monastery underwent significant changes, reflecting the tumultuous history of Ukraine. The monastery was closed during the Soviet era and was used as a warehouse and a storage facility. However, after Ukraine's independence, the monastery was restored and reopened in 1996.\n\n###**Demolition and aftermath**\n\nIn 1935, the Soviet authorities decided to demolish the monastery as part of a larger urban development project. The monastery's buildings were razed to the ground, and the site was left vacant. However, the monastery's golden dome was preserved and was later used as a model for the reconstruction of the monastery.\n\n###**Restoration**\n\nIn 1996, a team of architects and builders began the restoration of the monastery. The project was led by the Ukrainian government and was supported by international organizations and donors.\n\n###**Plans and preparatory work**\n\nThe restoration project involved a thorough analysis of the monastery's original architecture and a detailed plan for its reconstruction. The team of architects and builders worked closely with historians and conservators to ensure that the monastery was restored to its original glory.\n\n###**Rebuilding the monastery**\n\nThe rebuilding of the monastery involved the construction of new buildings, as well as the renovation of existing ones.

This phenomenon has occurred in various countries throughout history, often as a result of political upheaval, regime change, or collapse of a government.\n\nHistory\n\n### Russia (1917–1925)\n\nFollowing the Russian Revolution in 1917, the Russian government collapsed, and the Bolsheviks took control. The new government, led by Vladimir Lenin, established the Soviet Union, which marked the beginning of a new era in Russian politics. During this period, Russia's diplomatic missions around the world were affected, and some countries sent diplomatic missions to the Soviet Union without recognizing the new government.\n\n#### Diplomatic missions after 1917\n\nThe Russian Empire's diplomatic missions in Europe and other parts of the world were initially maintained by the provisional government, but after the October Revolution, these missions were taken over by the Bolsheviks. Many countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, initially refused to recognize the Soviet government, but eventually, they established diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. The Soviet government, in turn, maintained diplomatic missions in these countries, often under the guise of \"trade offices\" or \"consulates.\"\n\n#### Dissolution of the Soviet Union\n\nThe dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 marked the end of the Soviet era, and Russia's diplomatic missions around the world were transformed. The Russian government, now a federal republic, established new diplomatic missions, and many of the Soviet-era diplomatic missions were closed or re-designated. The Russian government also inherited many of the Soviet Union's international obligations, including its seat at the United Nations.\n\n### Spain (1939–1977)\n\nFollowing the Spanish Civil War, General Francisco Franco's Nationalist forces took control of Spain, establishing a dictatorship that lasted until Franco's death in 1975. During this period, Spain's diplomatic missions around the world were affected, and many countries refused to recognize the Franco regime.\n\n#### Diplomatic missions after 1939\n\nThe Spanish Republic's diplomatic missions were initially maintained by the Nationalists, but many of these missions were closed, and new diplomatic missions were established. The Franco regime also established new diplomatic missions, often with the support of fascist and authoritarian regimes in Europe and Latin America. The international community, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, initially refused to recognize the Franco regime, but eventually, they established diplomatic relations with Spain.\n\n### Poland (1939–1990)\n\nFollowing the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union in 1939, the Polish government was forced to flee, and the country was occupied by both powers. During World War II, Poland was divided between Germany and the Soviet Union, and the Polish government-in-exile was established in London. The Polish government-in-exile maintained diplomatic relations with many countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, but it did not control any territory in Poland.\n\n#### Diplomatic missions after 1939\n\nThe Polish government-in-exile established new diplomatic missions around the world, often under the guise of \"embassies\" or \"consulates.\" Many of these missions were established in countries that had declared war on Germany and were part of the Allied coalition. The Polish government-in-exile also maintained diplomatic relations with other countries, including the Soviet Union, despite the fact that the Soviet Union had invaded Poland in 1939.\n\n### Afghanistan (2021–present)\n\nFollowing the withdrawal of US and NATO forces from Afghanistan in August 2021, the Taliban, an Islamist extremist group, took control of the country. The international community, including the United Nations, initially refused to recognize the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan.\n\n#### Diplomatic missions after 2021\n\nThe Taliban established new diplomatic missions in countries that had recognized them as the legitimate government of Afghanistan, including China, Pakistan, and several countries in the Middle East. The international community, including the United States and other Western countries, has maintained diplomatic missions in Afghanistan, but these missions have been reduced in size and scope.\n\nSee also\n\n* Embassy\n* Diplomatic mission\n* Government in exile\n* International relations\n* Diplomatic recognition\n\nNotes", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The company was founded in 2019 by Sam Bankman-Fried and Gary Wang, and it quickly gained popularity among cryptocurrency traders due to its user-friendly interface and high leverage trading options. However, in November 2022, the company faced a major crisis that led to its bankruptcy and a significant impact on the cryptocurrency market.\n\nHistory\n\nFTX was founded in May 2019 by Sam Bankman-Fried, a graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and Gary Wang, a computer science major at Harvard University. The company was initially based in Hong Kong and was founded with the goal of creating a more user-friendly and accessible cryptocurrency derivatives exchange.\n\nIn the early days of FTX, the company focused on building a robust and secure platform that would allow users to trade cryptocurrencies with leverage. The company's platform was built on a custom-made trading engine that allowed for high-frequency trading and real-time risk management.\n\nFTX quickly gained popularity among cryptocurrency traders due to its user-friendly interface and high leverage trading options. The company's platform allowed users to trade cryptocurrencies with up to 101x leverage, making it one of the most popular and volatile trading platforms in the industry.\n\nNovember 2022 crisis and bankruptcy\n\nBackground: FTX and Alameda, Binance, and CoinDesk report\n\nIn November 2022, FTX faced a major crisis that led to its bankruptcy. The crisis began when a report by CoinDesk revealed that FTX had loaned billions of dollars to Alameda Research, a trading firm founded by Sam Bankman-Fried. The report sparked concern among investors and regulators, who began to question the financial health of FTX.\n\nCrisis begins: Binance FTT sale, sell-off, and withdrawn rescue bid\n\nOn November 6, 2022, Binance announced that it would sell its entire stake in FTT, the native cryptocurrency of FTX. The sale sparked a sell-off in the cryptocurrency market, with FTT prices plummeting by over 80% in a matter of hours.\n\nIn response to the crisis, Binance announced that it would provide a rescue bid to FTX, citing its commitment to the cryptocurrency industry. However, the bid was later withdrawn, and Binance announced that it would instead focus on acquiring FTX's assets.\n\nBankruptcy and unauthorized transactions\n\nOn November 11, 2022, FTX filed for bankruptcy in the United States, citing a liquidity crisis and a series of unauthorized transactions. The company's bankruptcy filing revealed that it had over $10 billion in liabilities and less than $1 billion in assets.\n\nWidening impact and contagion fears\n\nThe collapse of FTX had a significant impact on the cryptocurrency market, with many other firms facing a liquidity crisis and a loss of investor confidence. The incident sparked concerns about the stability of the cryptocurrency industry and the potential for contagion.\n\nEffects on investors\n\nThe collapse of FTX had a significant impact on investors, who lost billions of dollars in the crisis. Many investors were left with significant losses, and some were forced to sell their assets at significant discounts.\n\nEffects on other cryptocurrency firms and cryptocurrency markets\n\nThe collapse of FTX had a significant impact on other cryptocurrency firms, which faced a liquidity crisis and a loss of investor confidence. The incident sparked concerns about the stability of the cryptocurrency industry and the potential for contagion.\n\nResponses and commentary\n\nThe collapse of FTX sparked a significant response from the cryptocurrency community, with many experts and investors commenting on the incident. Some experts argued that the collapse of FTX was a result of a series of poor financial decisions, while others argued that it was a result of the volatility of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nLegal process\n\nFTX's bankruptcy filing sparked a significant legal process, with the company facing a series of lawsuits and investigations. The company's executives, including Sam Bankman-Fried, faced a series of allegations, including embezzlement and securities fraud.\n\nSponsorships\n\nFTX was a significant sponsor of various events and organizations, including the Miami Heat and the Miami Open. The company's collapse had a significant impact on its sponsorship portfolio, with many organizations suspending their relationships with FTX.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n* FTX official website\n* CoinDesk report on the collapse of FTX\n* Binance announcement on the sale of FTT\n* FTX bankruptcy filing\n* Sam Bankman-Fried's Twitter account\n* Gary Wang's LinkedIn profile", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The city of Mariupol, which is the administrative center of the Mariupol Municipality in the Donetsk Oblast, was a key strategic location in eastern Ukraine. The siege began in February 2022, when Russian forces surrounded the city, and lasted for approximately three months, resulting in significant human casualties and infrastructure damage.\n\n**Background**\n\nMariupol is a major port city with a population of approximately 500,000 people. It has been a significant industrial center in Ukraine, with a strong focus on steel production and other heavy industries. The city has a diverse economy, with a mix of heavy industry, agriculture, and services. Prior to the Russian invasion, Mariupol was a major hub for international trade, with significant connections to the Ukrainian economy and the global economy.\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine was sparked by a series of diplomatic tensions and military escalations between Russia and Ukraine, which began in 2014. In February 2022, Russia launched a large-scale military operation against Ukraine, with troops, tanks, and artillery moving towards major cities, including Mariupol. The Russian military sought to capture key territories in eastern Ukraine, including the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, and to establish a land bridge to the Crimean Peninsula.\n\n**Advances to Mariupol**\n\n### Preliminary shelling and advance on the city\n\nThe Russian military began shelling Mariupol on February 24, 2022, as part of a broader campaign against Ukrainian cities. The shelling was intense, with multiple rocket and artillery strikes hitting residential areas, hospitals, and other critical infrastructure. The Russian military also launched drone and missile attacks against Ukrainian military installations and air defenses.\n\nAs the Russian military advanced on Mariupol, the city's residents were caught in the middle of the conflict. Many fled their homes, seeking shelter in underground bunkers, schools, and other safe areas. The city's infrastructure was severely damaged, with power outages, water shortages, and communication disruptions reported throughout the city.\n\n### Mariupol surrounded\n\nBy February 27, 2022, the Russian military had completely surrounded Mariupol, with troops and tanks deployed on all sides of the city. The Ukrainian military, which was vastly outnumbered and outgunned, was unable to hold back the Russian advance. The city's residents were trapped, with limited access to food, water, and medical supplies.\n\n**Urban advances**\n\n### Russian push into the city\n\nOn March 1, 2022, the Russian military launched a push into the city of Mariupol, with troops and tanks advancing on multiple fronts. The Ukrainian military, which was vastly outnumbered and outgunned, was unable to hold back the Russian advance. The city's residents were caught in the midst of the conflict, with many reporting intense fighting and shelling.\n\nAs the Russian military advanced into the city, the Ukrainian military retreated to the Azovstal steel plant, a major industrial complex located on the city's outskirts. The plant, which was heavily fortified and equipped with Ukrainian military forces, became a key focal point in the conflict.\n\n### Final pockets of resistance\n\nBy March 15, 2022, the Russian military had largely captured the city of Mariupol, with only a few pockets of Ukrainian resistance remaining. The city's residents were trapped, with limited access to food, water, and medical supplies. The Ukrainian military, which was vastly outnumbered and outgunned, was unable to hold back the Russian advance.\n\n**Resistance in the Azovstal steel plant**\n\n### Withdrawal to Azovstal\n\nOn March 15, 2022, the Ukrainian military withdrew from the city of Mariupol, retreating to the Azovstal steel plant. The plant, which was heavily fortified and equipped with Ukrainian military forces, became a key focal point in the conflict. The Russian military, which had largely captured the city, laid siege to the plant, seeking to capture the remaining Ukrainian forces.\n\n### Siege of Azovstal\n\nThe siege of the Azovstal steel plant lasted for several weeks, with the Russian military launching intense artillery and missile strikes against the plant. The Ukrainian military, which was vastly outnumbered and outgunned, held out against the Russian advance, despite significant losses.\n\n### Evacuation of civilians\n\nOn May 3, 2022, the Russian military allowed a group of civilians to evacuate the Azovstal steel plant, with the International Red Cross facilitating the evacuation. The civilians, who were trapped in the plant for weeks, were taken to a safe location, where they received medical care and other humanitarian assistance.\n\n### Ukrainian surrender\n\nOn May 16, 2022, the Ukrainian military surrendered at the Azovstal steel plant, marking the end of the siege. The surrender came after a prolonged and intense conflict, with significant human casualties and infrastructure damage reported throughout the city.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\n### Demolition of buildings and Russification of the city\n\nFollowing the Ukrainian surrender, the Russian military began demolishing buildings and infrastructure in the city of Mariupol. The city's residents, who were forced to flee their homes during the conflict, were unable to return to their neighborhoods, as many buildings were left in ruins.\n\nThe Russian military also began a process of \"Russification\" in the city, with Russian language and culture being promoted throughout the city. The city's residents, who were largely ethnically Ukrainian, were forced to adapt to a new culture and language.\n\n### Last Ukrainian holdouts and prisoners of war\n\nFollowing the Ukrainian surrender, several Ukrainian holdouts remained in the city, including soldiers and civilians who were trapped in the Azovstal steel plant. The Russian military took these individuals into custody, holding them as prisoners of war.\n\n### City government's role\n\nThe city government of Mariupol, which was largely destroyed during the conflict, was forced to operate in exile. The government, which was led by Mayor Vadym Boychenko, worked to coordinate humanitarian efforts and provide assistance to the city's residents.\n\n### Claimed cholera outbreak\n\nIn May 2022, a reported cholera outbreak occurred in the city of Mariupol, with several cases reported. The outbreak was attributed to the city's poor sanitation and lack of access to clean water.\n\n### Ukrainian missile strikes\n\nIn June 2022, the Ukrainian military launched a series of missile strikes against Russian forces in the city of Mariupol. The strikes, which were aimed at disrupting Russian supply lines and military installations, resulted in significant damage and casualties.\n\n**Casualties**\n\n### Military casualties\n\nThe conflict in Mariupol resulted in significant military casualties, with estimates suggesting that several thousand Ukrainian soldiers were killed or wounded. The Russian military also suffered significant losses, with estimates suggesting that several thousand soldiers were killed or wounded.\n\n### Civilian casualties\n\nThe conflict in Mariupol also resulted in significant civilian casualties, with estimates suggesting that several thousand civilians were killed or wounded. The city's residents, who were trapped in the midst of the conflict, were forced to endure intense shelling and artillery strikes.\n\n**Humanitarian situation**\n\nThe humanitarian situation in Mariupol was dire, with the city's residents facing signi", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

He is best known for his circumnavigation of the globe in 1577-1580 and his raids on Spanish shipping and colonies.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nDrake was born in Tavistock, Devon, England, around 1540. His family was of relatively modest means, but his parents were well-respected members of the community. Little is known about his early life, but it is believed that he received a good education and was trained in navigation and seamanship from a young age.\n\n**Early Career at Sea**\n\nDrake's early career at sea began in the 1560s, when he sailed on a ship called the \"Mary Speedwell.\" He quickly gained a reputation as a skilled and daring sailor, and in 1567, he was appointed as the captain of a ship called the \"Swallow.\" Over the next few years, Drake participated in several voyages to the Mediterranean and the Atlantic, where he gained valuable experience and wealth.\n\n**Slave Trade**\n\nAs a young sailor, Drake was involved in the slave trade, which was a common practice among European sailors at the time. He sailed to Africa and brought back enslaved Africans to work on plantations in the Americas. This experience likely influenced his later views on colonialism and the treatment of indigenous peoples.\n\n**Expedition of 1572-1573**\n\nIn 1572, Drake sailed on an expedition to the west coast of Africa, where he traded with Portuguese colonizers and attacked several Spanish ships. This voyage helped to establish Drake's reputation as a skilled and daring sailor, and he was soon appointed to lead a new expedition to the Spanish Main.\n\n**Rathlin Island Massacre**\n\nIn 1573, Drake sailed to Ireland, where he participated in a raid on the island of Rathlin. The raid was part of a larger conflict between the English and the Irish, and it resulted in the deaths of many Irish civilians. This event was one of the first examples of Drake's willingness to engage in violence and destruction in pursuit of his goals.\n\n**Circumnavigation (1577-1580)**\n\nIn 1577, Drake set out on his most famous voyage, a circumnavigation of the globe. He sailed from Plymouth, England, with a fleet of five ships, including the \"Golden Hind.\" The expedition took over three years to complete, during which time Drake and his crew faced numerous challenges, including storms, mutinies, and encounters with hostile indigenous peoples.\n\n**Execution of Thomas Doughty**\n\nOne of the most significant events of the voyage was the execution of Thomas Doughty, a member of Drake's crew. Doughty had been accused of treason and mutiny, and he was put on trial by Drake and his officers. The trial was widely criticized as unfair, and it has been seen as an example of Drake's authoritarian leadership style.\n\n**Entering the Pacific (1578)**\n\nIn 1578, Drake and his crew sailed through the Strait of Magellan, which separated South America from the Atlantic. They then entered the Pacific Ocean, where they encountered numerous indigenous peoples and traded with some of them. This was the first time that English sailors had entered the Pacific, and it marked the beginning of a new era in exploration and colonization.\n\n**Raids on Spanish American West Coast**\n\nOver the next few months, Drake and his crew sailed up the west coast of South America, where they raided several Spanish colonies and ships. They also traded with some of the indigenous peoples, and they gathered valuable information about the Spanish colonies and their defenses.\n\n**Coast of California: Nova Albion (1579)**\n\nIn June 1579, Drake and his crew sailed up the coast of what is now California, where they claimed the land for England and named it Nova Albion. They spent several weeks exploring the coast and trading with the indigenous peoples, and they established a small settlement on the coast.\n\n**Across the Pacific and Around Africa**\n\nAfter spending several months on the west coast of North America, Drake and his crew set sail across the Pacific, where they encountered numerous challenges, including storms and encounters with hostile indigenous peoples. They eventually sailed around Africa, where they encountered the Portuguese and some of their colonies.\n\n**Return to Plymouth (1580)**\n\nIn September 1580, Drake and his crew returned to Plymouth, England, where they were greeted as heroes. They had completed a remarkable voyage, during which they had circumnavigated the globe and raided several Spanish colonies and ships.\n\n**Knighthood and Arms**\n\nFor his services to the crown, Drake was knighted in 1581 and granted a coat of arms. His arms featured a dragon, which was a reference to his nickname, \"the Dragon of the Sea.\"\n\n**Political Career**\n\nAfter his return to England, Drake was involved in several political and military campaigns, including the conflict with the Spanish Armada. He was a vocal supporter of the English monarchy and was involved in several plots to overthrow Queen Elizabeth I's successor, James I.\n\n**Great Expedition to America**\n\nIn 1585, Drake was appointed to lead a new expedition to the Spanish Main, where he was to gather intelligence and disrupt Spanish shipping. This expedition was known as the Great Expedition to America, and it marked the beginning of a new era in English colonization.\n\n**Conflict with the Spanish Armada**\n\nIn 1588, the Spanish Armada set sail from Spain, where it was to invade England and overthrow Queen Elizabeth I. Drake was appointed to lead the English fleet, which was tasked with defeating the Armada and protecting the English coast. The conflict was fierce and involved several battles, including the Battle of Gravelines, where the English defeated the Spanish.\n\n**Cádiz Raid**\n\nIn 1596, Drake was appointed to lead a new expedition to the Spanish Main, where he was to gather intelligence and disrupt Spanish shipping. This expedition included a raid on the port of Cádiz, which was a major Spanish naval base. The raid was successful, and it marked the beginning of a new era in English naval warfare.\n\n**Defeat of the Spanish Armada**\n\nIn 1588, the Spanish Armada was defeated by the English fleet, led by Drake. The defeat was a major blow to the Spanish monarchy and marked the beginning of a new era in English naval dominance.\n\n**English Armada**\n\nIn 1601, the English Armada set sail from England, where it was to invade Spain and overthrow the Spanish monarchy. Drake was appointed to lead the Armada, but he died of fever before the expedition could set sail.\n\n**Defeats and Death**\n\nDrake's later years were marked by a series of defeats and setbacks. He died of fever in 1596, at the age of 56, before he could complete his planned expedition to the Spanish Main.\n\n**Family and Heritage**\n\nDrake was married to Mary Newman, and they had a daughter together. He also had several illegitimate children, and his family continued to play an important role in English politics and society for generations.\n\n**Legacy and Honours**\n\nDrake's legacy is complex and multifaceted. He is remembered as a hero of the English monarchy and a pioneer of English exploration and colonization. He is also remembered as a skilled and daring sailor who played a significant role in the conflict with the Spanish Armada. His legacy has been the subject of numerous books, films, and other works of art.\n\n**Geographical Names**\n\nSeveral geographical features have been named after Drake, including:\n\n* Drake Bay, a bay in Costa Rica\n* Drake Passage, a strait that separates South America from Antarctica\n* Drake Island, a small island in the Falkland Islands\n\n**See Also**\n\n* English colonization of the Americas\n* Spanish colonization of the Americas\n* English navy\n* Spanish navy\n* Conflict with the Spanish Armada\n* Great Expedition to America\n* Cádiz raid\n\n**References**\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n**Bibliography**\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n**External Links**\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n*", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

These claims have been thoroughly debunked by fact-checkers and experts.\n\nDiscovery of classified documents at Mike Pence's residence\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nOn January 24, 2023, it was reported that classified documents had been discovered at the residence of former Vice President Mike Pence in Indiana. The documents were said to be from Pence's time as Vice President, and they included materials related to national security and intelligence. This development has raised questions about the handling of classified information by senior government officials and has sparked a renewed focus on the issue of classified document storage and handling.\n\nInvestigations\n--------------\n\n### Special counsel\n\nThe discovery of classified documents has led to the appointment of a special counsel to investigate the matter. The special counsel has been tasked with examining the circumstances surrounding the discovery of the documents and determining whether any laws have been broken.\n\n### Decision that charges were unwarranted\n\nOn February 23, 2023, the special counsel announced that they had completed their investigation and had determined that charges were unwarranted in the case of the discovery of classified documents at Biden's home. The special counsel stated that while the discovery of classified documents was improper, it did not appear to be intentional or motivated by any nefarious purpose.\n\n### Comments on Biden's memory\n\nIn a statement, the special counsel expressed confidence in Biden's memory and stated that the former President's recollection of events was consistent with the evidence. This statement has been seen as a reassurance to the public that Biden's integrity and cognitive abilities are not in question.\n\nCongressional\n------------\n\nThe discovery of classified documents has also sparked a range of reactions from Congressional leaders. Some have called for further investigation into the matter, while others have expressed confidence in Biden's integrity. The issue of classified document storage and handling has been raised as a concern, and some have called for reforms to ensure that classified information is handled properly.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n*   Classified documents controversy\n*   Joe Biden's presidency\n*   United States Department of Justice\n*   FBI investigation\n*   Classified information", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The battle saw a fierce engagement between the United Nations Command (UNC) forces, consisting of Australian, Canadian, and South Korean troops, and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army (PVA).\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Korean War had been raging since June 1950, with the UNC forces making significant gains in the early stages of the conflict. However, as the war entered its second year, the PVA, under the leadership of General Peng Dehuai, launched a counterattack designed to retake Seoul and drive the UNC forces back to the 38th parallel. This counterattack, known as the Chinese Spring Offensive, marked a significant turning point in the war.\n\n**Military Situation**\n\nPrior to the Chinese Spring Offensive, the UNC forces had established a defensive line along the Han River, with the Australians and Canadians holding positions in the Kapyong Valley. The PVA, meanwhile, had been massing troops along the 38th parallel, preparing for a major assault.\n\n**Chinese Spring Offensive**\n\n#### Preparations\n\nThe PVA began to prepare for the Chinese Spring Offensive in late March 1951, with General Peng Dehuai issuing a series of orders to his troops. The PVA's plan was to launch a surprise attack on the UNC forces, aiming to break through the defensive line and drive the UNC back to the 38th parallel.\n\n#### Launch of Chinese Spring Offensive\n\nOn 22 April 1951, the PVA launched its offensive, with a series of artillery bombardments and infantry assaults aimed at breaking through the Australian and Canadian positions. The initial assault was launched by the 118th Division, which made significant gains in the early stages of the battle.\n\n#### South Korean Withdrawal, 22–23 April 1951\n\nAs the PVA's assault gained momentum, the South Korean 6th Infantry Division began to withdraw from its positions in the Kapyong Valley. The South Korean troops were ordered to fall back to the east, in an attempt to avoid being encircled by the PVA.\n\n**Australian 3 RAR Defence of Hill 504, 23–24 April 1951**\n\nAs the PVA continued its assault, the Australian 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (3 RAR) found itself facing intense pressure on Hill 504. The Australians were determined to hold their position, and they fought fiercely to repel the PVA's attacks.\n\n#### Night Battle\n\nOn the night of 23 April, the PVA launched a series of night attacks on the Australian positions, in an attempt to disrupt their command and control. The Australians, however, were well-prepared and managed to repel the attacks.\n\n#### Day Battle\n\nThe following day, the PVA launched a series of infantry assaults on the Australian positions, in an attempt to break through the defensive line. The Australians fought bravely, but they were eventually forced to withdraw from Hill 504.\n\n#### 3 RAR Withdraws\n\nOn 24 April, the 3 RAR was ordered to withdraw from its positions on Hill 504, in order to regroup and reorganize. The Australians had suffered significant casualties during the battle, but they had managed to hold off the PVA's assault.\n\n**Canadian 2 PPCLI Last Stand on Hill 677, 24–25 April 1951**\n\nAs the PVA continued its assault, the Canadian 2nd Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry (2 PPCLI) found itself facing intense pressure on Hill 677. The Canadians were determined to hold their position, and they fought fiercely to repel the PVA's attacks.\n\n#### Preparations\n\nThe Canadians had prepared for the PVA's assault by digging in and establishing strong defensive positions on the hill. The Canadians were well-entrenched and had a clear view of the surrounding area.\n\n#### Night Battle\n\nOn the night of 24 April, the PVA launched a series of night attacks on the Canadian positions, in an attempt to disrupt their command and control. The Canadians, however, were well-prepared and managed to repel the attacks.\n\n#### Final 2 PPCLI Operations\n\nThe following day, the PVA launched a series of infantry assaults on the Canadian positions, in an attempt to break through the defensive line. The Canadians fought bravely, but they were eventually forced to withdraw from Hill 677.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe Battle of Kapyong was a significant turning point in the Korean War, with the UNC forces suffering heavy casualties but managing to hold off the PVA's assault. The battle marked a major shift in the balance of power on the Korean Peninsula, with the UNC forces eventually gaining the upper hand.\n\n#### Summary and Casualties\n\nThe Battle of Kapyong was fought between 22 and 25 April 1951, with the UNC forces suffering significant casualties. The Australians lost 32 killed and 95 wounded, while the Canadians lost 52 killed and 105 wounded. The PVA, meanwhile, lost an estimated 3,000 to 5,000 soldiers.\n\n#### Awards\n\nThe Battle of Kapyong was a highly decorated battle, with several recipients of the Victoria Cross. The Australians awarded the Victoria Cross to two soldiers, while the Canadians awarded the Victoria Cross to one soldier.\n\n#### Subsequent Operations\n\nFollowing the Battle of Kapyong, the UNC forces continued to push forward, eventually recapturing Seoul in March 1951. The PVA, meanwhile, continued to fight, but they were eventually forced to withdraw in disarray. The battle marked a major turning point in the Korean War, with the UNC forces gaining the upper hand and eventually achieving a stalemate.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.
