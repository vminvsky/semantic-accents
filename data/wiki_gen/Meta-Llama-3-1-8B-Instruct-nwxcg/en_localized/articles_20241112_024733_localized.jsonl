The tournament was held in Edmonton and Red Deer, Alberta, Canada, from December 26, 2021, to January 5, 2022. The tournament was organized by the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) and was the 46th edition of the World Junior Ice Hockey Championships.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe World Junior Ice Hockey Championships is an annual international ice hockey tournament held for national teams of players under the age of 20. The tournament is considered one of the premier international junior ice hockey competitions and is a key event in the development of young ice hockey players. The tournament features teams from around the world, with the top teams competing in the top division.\n\n**Preparations**\n\nPreparations for the 2022 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships began several months in advance of the tournament. The IIHF selected Edmonton and Red Deer, Alberta, Canada, as the host cities for the tournament. The host cities were chosen for their state-of-the-art ice hockey facilities and their ability to accommodate the large number of teams and spectators that would be attending the tournament.\n\n**Cancellation and rescheduling of tournament due to COVID-19**\n\nIn the fall of 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic was still affecting many countries around the world. As a result, the IIHF was forced to cancel the 2022 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships in August 2021, just a few weeks before the scheduled start of the tournament. The IIHF rescheduled the tournament for December 2021, with the hope that the pandemic would have subsided by then. However, the pandemic continued to affect many countries, and the IIHF was forced to make significant changes to the tournament in order to accommodate the safety protocols that were in place.\n\n**Sponsorship withdrawals and low attendance**\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, several major sponsors of the World Junior Ice Hockey Championships withdrew their support for the tournament. This resulted in a significant reduction in the amount of money available for the tournament, and the IIHF was forced to make significant cuts in order to stay within budget. The pandemic also resulted in low attendance at the tournament, with many spectators choosing to stay home rather than travel to the host cities.\n\n**Group A (December 2021)**\n\nThe 2022 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships featured 10 teams in the top division, divided into two groups: Group A and Group B. Group A featured the following teams:\n\n*  Canada\n*  Finland\n*  Germany\n*  Russia\n*  Slovakia\n*  Sweden\n\n**Group B (December 2021)**\n\nGroup B featured the following teams:\n\n*  Czech Republic\n*  Denmark\n*  Kazakhstan\n*  Latvia\n*  Switzerland\n*  United States\n\n**Top Division**\n\nThe top division of the 2022 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships featured 10 teams, divided into two groups: Group A and Group B.

The early crusades, which took place in the 11th and 12th centuries, were largely driven by the Catholic Church's desire to reclaim the Holy Land from Muslim rule. However, the later crusades were marked by a more complex set of motivations, including economic, political, and social factors.\n\n# Chronologies of the Crusades in Print\n\nChronologies of the Crusades have been extensively documented in various forms of literature and historical accounts. The works of medieval chroniclers such as William of Tyre and Matthew Paris provide valuable insights into the events of the Later Crusades. Additionally, the accounts of modern historians have shed further light on the complexities of the period. The chronologies of the crusades serve as a crucial tool for understanding the historical context and the sequence of events that shaped the Later Crusades.\n\n# 13th century\n\n## Prior Events\n\nThe Later Crusades were influenced by a series of prior events that set the stage for the conflicts to come. The Fourth Crusade, which took place from 1202 to 1204, saw the diversion of crusader forces to Constantinople, leading to the sack of the city and the establishment of the Latin Empire. This event had significant repercussions for the Byzantine Empire and created tensions that would persist throughout the 13th century.\n\n## 1270\n\nIn 1270, the Seventh Crusade was launched by King Louis IX of France, who sought to reclaim the Holy Land from Muslim rule. The crusade was marked by a series of military setbacks and the death of King Louis IX in Tunisia. The failure of the Seventh Crusade highlighted the challenges faced by the crusaders and the need for a more coordinated approach to the conflicts.\n\n## 1280\n\nThe late 13th century saw a significant increase in the activities of the Mamluk Sultanate, which had emerged as a major power in the Middle East. The Mamluks were a slave-soldier caste that had risen to power in Egypt and had established a network of alliances with other Muslim states. In 1280, the Mamluks defeated the Mongols at the Battle of Hulwan, marking a significant turning point in the history of the region.\n\n## 1290\n\nIn 1290, King Edward I of England launched the Ninth Crusade, which was aimed at reclaiming the Holy Land from Muslim rule. The crusade was marked by a series of military setbacks and the death of King Edward I in 1307. The failure of the Ninth Crusade highlighted the challenges faced by the crusaders and the need for a more coordinated approach to the conflicts.\n\n# 14th century\n\n## 1300\n\nThe 14th century saw a significant shift in the dynamics of the conflicts. The Black Death, which had devastated Europe in the 1340s, had a profound impact on the social and economic structures of the region. The plague led to a significant decline in the population, which in turn had a major impact on the feudal system.\n\n## 1310\n\nIn 1310, the Hospitaller Knights, a military order that had been established in the 12th century, were forced to flee from their stronghold in Acre after the Mamluks had launched a series of attacks on the city. The Hospitallers were eventually forced to abandon their stronghold and retreat to the island of Cyprus.\n\n## 1320\n\nThe 1320s saw a significant increase in the activities of the Ottoman Empire, which had emerged as a major power in the region. The Ottomans were a Turkish people who had risen to power in Anatolia and had established a network of alliances with other Muslim states. In 1326, the Ottomans captured the city of Bursa, marking a significant turning point in the history of the region.\n\n## 1330\n\nIn 1330, the Knights Templar, a military order that had been established in the 12th century, were accused of heresy and were subsequently disbanded by King Philip VI of France. The disbanding of the Templars had a significant impact on the social and economic structures of the region.\n\n## 1340\n\nThe 1340s saw a significant increase in the activities of the Mamluk Sultanate, which had emerged as a major power in the Middle East. The Mamluks were a slave-soldier caste that had risen to power in Egypt and had established a network of alliances with other Muslim states. In 1347, the Mamluks captured the city of Gaza, marking a significant turning point in the history of the region.\n\n## 1350\n\nThe 1350s saw a significant decline in the power of the Christian states in the region. The Ottoman Empire had continued to expand its territory, and the Mamluk Sultanate had emerged as a major power in the Middle East. In 1359, the Ottoman Empire captured the city of Adrianople, marking a significant turning point in the history of the region.\n\n## 1360\n\nThe 1360s saw a significant increase in the activities of the Black Death, which had devastated Europe in the 1340s. The plague led to a significant decline in the population, which in turn had a major impact on the feudal system.\n\n## 1370\n\nIn 1370, the Ottoman Empire captured the city of Gallipoli, marking a significant turning point in the history of the region. The Ottoman Empire had continued to expand its territory, and the Mamluk Sultanate had emerged as a major power in the Middle East.\n\n## 1380\n\nThe 1380s saw a significant decline in the power of the Christian states in the region. The Ottoman Empire had continued to expand its territory, and the Mamluk Sultanate had emerged as a major power in the Middle East. In 1389, the Ottoman Empire captured the city of Nicopolis, marking a significant turning point in the history of the region.\n\n## 1390\n\nIn 1390, the Ottoman Empire captured the city of Salonica, marking a significant turning point in the history of the region. The Ottoman Empire had continued to expand its territory, and the Mamluk Sultanate had emerged as a major power in the Middle East.\n\n# 15th century\n\n## 1400\n\nThe 15th century saw a significant shift in the dynamics of the conflicts. The Ottoman Empire had continued to expand its territory, and the Mamluk Sultanate had emerged as a major power in the Middle East. In 1402, the Ottoman Empire captured the city of Nicopolis, marking a significant turning point in the history of the region.\n\nThis article provides a comprehensive overview of the chronology of the Later Crusades through 1400.

Davis restructuring\n##Headquarters\n#See also\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Gulf and Western Industries\n\nGulf and Western Industries was a multinational conglomerate based in the United States. The company was formed in 1954 through the merger of three separate companies: the Continental Oil Company, the National Sugar Company, and the Equitable Life Assurance Society. Over the years, the company underwent significant changes, including a major restructuring under the leadership of Charles Bluhdorn and later Martin S. Davis.\n\n**History**\n\nGulf and Western Industries was a major player in the global market, with interests spanning a range of industries including energy, food, textiles, and entertainment. The company's history can be divided into several key periods, each marked by significant events and changes.\n\n### Bluhdorn period\n\nCharles Bluhdorn, a German-American businessman, became the CEO of Gulf and Western in 1964. Under his leadership, the company underwent a major restructuring, selling off non-core assets and focusing on its most profitable businesses. Bluhdorn's strategy was to create a more streamlined and efficient company, and he achieved significant success in this endeavor. During his tenure, Gulf and Western invested heavily in the film industry, acquiring Paramount Pictures in 1966. This move marked a significant shift in the company's focus towards entertainment, and it would go on to become a major player in the industry.\n\n### Early 1980s\n\nIn the early 1980s, Gulf and Western Industries faced significant challenges, including rising costs, increased competition, and a decline in the company's core energy business. In response to these challenges, the company underwent another major restructuring, this time under the leadership of Martin S. Davis. Davis, who had served as CEO of Gulf and Western since 1978, implemented a series of cost-cutting measures and divested several non-core businesses. The company also invested heavily in new technologies and pursued new business opportunities, including a major expansion into the gaming industry.\n\n### Martin S. Davis restructuring\n\nUnder Davis' leadership, Gulf and Western Industries underwent a significant transformation, shifting its focus towards more profitable businesses and reducing its exposure to less profitable sectors. Davis' restructuring efforts were marked by a series of significant deals, including the sale of the company's sugar business and the acquisition of a major stake in the Italian energy company Eni. The company also invested heavily in new technologies, including a major expansion into the renewable energy sector.\n\n### Headquarters\n\nGulf and Western Industries was headquartered in New York City, with major operations in several other locations around the world. The company's headquarters were located in the heart of Manhattan, and it maintained a significant presence in the city throughout its history. In addition to its New York headquarters, the company also maintained major operations in cities such as Los Angeles, London, and Rome.\n\n**See also**\n\nGulf and Western Industries was a major player in the global market, and its history and legacy continue to be felt today. Some of the key topics related to the company include:\n\n* Paramount Pictures: Gulf and Western's acquisition of Paramount Pictures in 1966 marked a significant shift in the company's focus towards entertainment.\n* Energy industry: Gulf and Western's core energy business was a major part of the company's operations for many years.\n* Martin S. Davis: Davis served as CEO of Gulf and Western Industries from 1978 until the company's demise in the late 1980s.\n* Charles Bluhdorn: Bluhdorn served as CEO of Gulf and Western from 1964 until his death in 1983.\n* Conglomerate: Gulf and Western Industries was a classic example of a conglomerate, with interests spanning a range of industries.\n* Restructuring: The company underwent two major restructuring efforts during its history, both of which were led by Martin S.

From the earliest indigenous inhabitants to the present day, Taiwan has been shaped by waves of immigration, colonization, and conflict. This article will explore the major periods and events in Taiwan's history, from prehistory to the present day.\n\n**Prehistory**\n\nThe earliest known inhabitants of Taiwan were the indigenous peoples, who migrated to the island from the Asian mainland around 10,000 years ago. These early inhabitants lived in small tribes, relying on hunting, gathering, and fishing to survive. As the climate changed and the population grew, the indigenous peoples developed more complex societies, with specialization of labor and the use of tools such as the bow and arrow.\n\n**Chinese contact and settlement**\n\nThe first recorded contact between Taiwan and the Chinese mainland dates back to the 16th century, when the Ming dynasty sent explorers to the island. The Chinese were attracted to Taiwan's natural resources, including timber, minerals, and fertile land. In the early 17th century, Chinese settlers began to arrive in Taiwan, establishing trade relationships with the indigenous peoples.\n\n**Dutch and Spanish colonies (1624–1668)**\n\nIn the early 17th century, European powers, including the Dutch and the Spanish, began to take an interest in Taiwan as a strategic location for trade. In 1624, the Dutch established their first colony on Taiwan, which they named Zeelandia. The Dutch were attracted to Taiwan's natural resources, particularly its timber and minerals.\n\n### Contact and establishment\n\nThe Dutch established their colony on Taiwan with the goal of trading with the indigenous peoples and exploiting the island's resources. They built a fort and a settlement, which they named Fort Zeelandia, and established trade relationships with the indigenous peoples. The Dutch also introduced Christianity to Taiwan, with the arrival of Jesuit missionaries in the 1620s.\n\n### Piracy\n\nDuring the Dutch period, piracy became a major problem in Taiwan. The Dutch colonizers faced opposition from the indigenous peoples, who resented the Dutch presence on their land. The indigenous peoples also formed alliances with pirates, who raided Dutch ships and settlements. The Dutch responded by establishing a naval force to protect their interests and suppress piracy.\n\n### Japanese trade\n\nIn the mid-17th century, the Japanese began to take an interest in Taiwan as a trade partner. The Japanese established trade relationships with the Dutch, who controlled the island at the time. The Japanese traded with the Dutch for goods such as sugar, rice, and silk.\n\n### Spanish Formosa\n\nIn 1626, the Spanish established their own colony on Taiwan, which they named Formosa. The Spanish colony was established with the goal of trading with the indigenous peoples and exploiting the island's resources. However, the Spanish colony was short-lived, and the Spanish were eventually driven out by the Dutch.\n\n### Dutch colonization\n\nThe Dutch established their colonization of Taiwan in 1624, with the arrival of a Dutch fleet. The Dutch colonizers faced opposition from the indigenous peoples, who resented the Dutch presence on their land. However, the Dutch were able to establish a firm grip on the island, and their colonization of Taiwan lasted for over 50 years.\n\n### Chinese settlers\n\nDuring the Dutch period, Chinese settlers began to arrive in Taiwan in large numbers. The Chinese were attracted to Taiwan's fertile land and natural resources, and they established themselves as farmers and traders. The Chinese settlers played a major role in shaping Taiwan's culture and economy, and they remained a dominant force on the island for centuries to come.\n\n### End of Dutch rule\n\nIn 1662, the Dutch were driven out of Taiwan by a Chinese fleet led by Zheng Chenggong, a pirate-turned-governor who had established his own dynasty on the island. The Dutch were defeated, and their colony was captured by the Chinese. The Chinese established their own rule on Taiwan, which lasted for over a century.\n\n**Kingdom of Tungning (1661–1683)**\n\nThe Kingdom of Tungning was a Chinese dynasty that was established on Taiwan in 1662 by Zheng Chenggong. The kingdom was established with the goal of defending Taiwan against the Dutch and other foreign powers. The kingdom was short-lived, and it was eventually absorbed into the Qing dynasty in 1683.\n\n### Conquest\n\nThe Kingdom of Tungning was established after the defeat of the Dutch on Taiwan. Zheng Chenggong, a Chinese pirate-turned-governor, led a fleet of ships to Taiwan and captured the Dutch colony. The Kingdom of Tungning was established with Zheng Chenggong as its ruler.\n\n### Retreat to Taiwan\n\nAfter the defeat of the Dutch, Zheng Chenggong retreated to Taiwan, where he established his kingdom. The kingdom was established with the goal of defending Taiwan against the Dutch and other foreign powers.\n\n### Sinicization\n\nDuring the Kingdom of Tungning, Taiwan underwent a process of sinicization, in which the island's culture and economy were shaped by Chinese traditions and values. The Chinese introduced their language, customs, and institutions to Taiwan, and the island became increasingly integrated into the Chinese world.\n\n### Shi Lang\n\nIn 1683, Shi Lang, a Chinese admiral, led a fleet to Taiwan and captured the Kingdom of Tungning. Shi Lang was a loyal servant of the Qing dynasty, and he played a key role in the conquest of Taiwan.\n\n### End of Zheng rule\n\nThe Kingdom of Tungning was eventually absorbed into the Qing dynasty in 1683, marking the end of Zheng rule on Taiwan.\n\n**Qing dynasty (1683–1895)**\n\nThe Qing dynasty was a Chinese dynasty that ruled Taiwan from 1683 to 1895. During this period, Taiwan underwent significant economic, social, and cultural changes.\n\n### Annexation\n\nTaiwan was annexed by the Qing dynasty in 1683, after the defeat of the Kingdom of Tungning. The Qing established their rule on the island, and Taiwan became a province of China.\n\n### Taiwan administration\n\nDuring the Qing period, Taiwan was administered by the Qing government in China. The island was divided into provinces and counties, and the Qing established a system of taxation and law enforcement.\n\n### Settler expansion (1684–1795)\n\nDuring the Qing period, Chinese settlers continued to arrive in Taiwan in large numbers. The settlers established themselves as farmers, traders, and artisans, and they played a major role in shaping Taiwan's economy and culture.\n\n### Administrative expansion (1796–1874)\n\nIn the late 18th century, the Qing government expanded its administrative control over Taiwan. The island was divided into smaller units, and the Qing established a system of provincial and county governments.\n\n### Expansion in reaction to crises (1875–1895)\n\nDuring the late 19th century, Taiwan faced several crises, including the Opium Wars and the Taiping Rebellion. In response to these crises, the Qing government expanded its control over Taiwan and imposed new taxes and regulations on the island.\n\n### Rebellions\n\nDuring the Qing period, Taiwan faced several rebellions, including the White Lotus Rebellion and the Paiwan Rebellion. The rebellions were led by indigenous groups who resented the Qing government's rule on the island.\n\n### Invasions\n\nTaiwan was invaded by foreign powers, including the Dutch and the British, during the Qing period. The island was also threatened by pirates and privateers.\n\n### End of Qing rule\n\nThe Qing dynasty was overthrown in 1912, marking the end of Qing rule on Taiwan.\n\n**Japanese Empire (1895–1945)**\n\nThe Japanese Empire ruled Taiwan from 1895 to 1945. During this period, Taiwan underwent significant economic, social, and cultural changes.\n\n### Armed resistance\n\nTaiwanese people resisted Japanese rule through armed resistance, including the Datong Uprising and the Taiwanese Communist Party's armed struggle.\n\n### Non-violent resistance\n\nTaiwanese people also resisted Japanese rule through non-violent means, including the Taiwanese independence movement and the women's suffrage movement.\n\n### Assimilation movement\n\nThe Japanese government attempted to assimilate the Taiwanese people into Japanese culture, through the promotion of Japanese language and education.\n\n### Education\n\nThe Japanese government established a system of education on Taiwan, which emphasized Japanese language and culture.\n\n### Japanization\n\nThe Japanese government attempted to Japanize the Taiwanese people, through the promotion of Japanese customs and traditions.\n\n### Aboriginal policies\n\nThe Japanese government had a complex relationship with Taiwan's indigenous peoples, who were subject to forced assimilation and land expropriation.\n\n### Japanese colonists\n\nThe Japanese government encouraged Japanese colonists to settle on Taiwan, which led to conflicts with Taiwanese people and indigenous groups.\n\n### Industrialization\n\nThe Japanese government invested in Taiwan's industrialization, which led to rapid economic growth and urbanization.\n\n### World War II\n\nTaiwan was invaded by Japan in 1895, during the First Sino-Japanese War. The island was occupied by Japan throughout World War II, and Taiwanese people were conscripted into the Japanese military.\n\n### End of Japanese rule\n\nJapan surrendered to the Allied Powers in 1945, marking the end of Japanese rule on Taiwan.\n\n**Republic of China (1945–present)**\n\nThe Republic of China (ROC) ruled Taiwan from 1945 to the present day.

The season premiered on July 6, 2023, on CBS and concluded on September 27, 2023. The season was hosted by Julie Chen Moonves and featured a new format, which included a twist called the \"BB Multiverse.\"\n\n**Format changes and additions**\n\nThe season introduced several changes to the Big Brother format. One of the most notable changes was the introduction of the \"BB Multiverse,\" a twist that allowed contestants to participate in alternate versions of the game. The BB Multiverse allowed contestants to switch between different versions of the game, each with its own unique challenges and twists.\n\n### **BB Break-in and BB Multiverse**\n\nThe BB Multiverse was introduced in a twist called the \"BB Break-in.\" During the break-in, contestants were given the opportunity to participate in a special challenge that would determine which version of the game they would be in. The challenge, called the \"Multiverse Gauntlet,\" was a series of physical and mental challenges that contestants had to complete in order to win a spot in one of the alternate versions of the game.\n\n### **BB Multiverse**\n\nThe BB Multiverse consisted of four different versions of the game, each with its own unique challenges and twists.\n\n#### **Comic-verse**\n\nThe Comic-verse was a humorous version of the game, where contestants had to complete challenges that were designed to be comedic.

Contestants in the Humili-verse had to complete challenges that were designed to be embarrassing, such as wearing ridiculous costumes and participating in awkward social interactions.\n\n#### **Scary-verse**\n\nThe Scary-verse was a version of the game that was designed to be frightening.

Contestants in the Scramble-verse had to complete challenges that were designed to be confusing, such as navigating a maze filled with obstacles and participating in a series of unexpected challenges.\n\n### **Smaller jury**\n\nAnother change to the Big Brother format was the introduction of a smaller jury. In previous seasons, the jury consisted of 9 members, but in Big Brother 25, the jury was reduced to 6 members. The smaller jury was seen as a way to make the game more intense and more focused on the relationships between the contestants.\n\n**Houseguests**\n\nThe houseguests in Big Brother 25 were a diverse group of individuals from different backgrounds and with different personalities.\n\n**Future appearances**\n\nSome of the houseguests from Big Brother 25 have gone on to appear in other reality television shows, including Survivor and The Challenge.\n\n**Episodes**\n\nThe season consisted of 42 episodes, including the premiere episode, the finale episode, and 40 regular episodes.\n\n**Voting history**\n\nThe voting history of the season was complex, with several twists and turns along the way. The first few episodes of the season saw a strong alliance form between several of the houseguests, but as the season progressed, the alliances began to break down and new alliances formed.\n\n**Production**\n\nThe production of Big Brother 25 was led by a team of producers who worked tirelessly to bring the season to life.\n\n### **Development**\n\nThe development of Big Brother 25 was a long process that involved a team of writers, producers, and other crew members. The team worked together to create a format that was both exciting and challenging for the contestants.\n\n### **Casting**\n\nThe casting of Big Brother 25 was a highly competitive process that involved auditioning hundreds of contestants before selecting the final 16 houseguests.\n\n### **Production design**\n\nThe production design of Big Brother 25 was a key element in creating the show's unique look and feel. The team worked to create a set that was both functional and visually appealing, and the result was a show that was both entertaining and informative.\n\n**Release**\n\nThe season premiered on July 6, 2023, on CBS and concluded on September 27, 2023. The season was also available to stream on the CBS website and on various online platforms.\n\n### **Broadcast**\n\nThe season was broadcast on CBS in the United States, and it was also available to stream on the CBS website and on various online platforms.\n\n### **Streaming**\n\nThe season was available to stream on the CBS website and on various online platforms, including Hulu and Amazon Prime Video.\n\n**Reception**\n\nThe season received a mixed reaction from critics and audiences alike.\n\n### **Critical responses**\n\nThe season was praised for its unique format and its ability to create tension and drama, but it was also criticized for its perceived lack of diversity and its handling of certain issues.\n\n### **Luke Valentine's usage of an ethnic slur**\n\nOne of the most controversy surrounding the season was the usage of an ethnic slur by one of the houseguests, Luke Valentine. The incident sparked a heated debate about the use of language and the impact it can have on marginalized communities.\n\n### **Accessibility issues for Matt Klotz**\n\nAnother issue that arose during the season was the accessibility issues faced by one of the houseguests, Matt Klotz.

It is the world's third-largest country by both area and population, and one of the world's most influential and powerful nations. The capital city is Washington, D.C., and the largest city is New York City.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe name \"United States\" comes from the 13 original colonies that declared independence from Great Britain in 1776. The term \"states\" was used to describe the newly formed colonies, which were united under a single government. The name was officially adopted in 1777, when the Continental Congress resolved to use the term \"United States\" in all official documents.\n\n**History**\n\n### Indigenous peoples\n\nThe first human presence in what is now the United States dates back to the Paleoindian period, around 15,000 years ago. The indigenous peoples of the Americas developed complex societies, including the Mississippian culture, which flourished in the Eastern Woodlands region from around 800 to 1500 CE. The native populations were diverse, with over 500 distinct tribes and languages spoken across the continent.\n\n### European settlement and conflict (1607–1765)\n\nIn 1607, the English established the Jamestown settlement in present-day Virginia, which marked the beginning of European colonization in what is now the United States. Over the next century, European powers, including the Spanish, French, and British, established colonies along the eastern seaboard. The conflict between European settlers and indigenous peoples led to the displacement and violence of native populations, as well as the introduction of European diseases that decimated native populations.\n\n### American Revolution and the early republic (1765–1800)\n\nThe American Revolution began in 1775, when the Continental Army, led by George Washington, defeated the British at the Battle of Saratoga. The Treaty of Paris, signed in 1783, recognized American independence. The early republic was marked by the adoption of the United States Constitution in 1787 and the Bill of Rights in 1791. The United States expanded its territory through the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, which doubled the country's size.\n\n### Westward expansion and Civil War (1800–1865)\n\nThe early 19th century saw a period of rapid westward expansion, as the United States acquired new territories through the Mexican-American War and the Oregon Treaty. The abolitionist movement, led by figures such as Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman, sought to end slavery, which had been established in the United States since colonial times. The American Civil War, fought from 1861 to 1865, resulted in the defeat of the Confederate States of America and the abolition of slavery.\n\n### Post–Civil War era (1865–1917)\n\nThe Reconstruction Era, following the Civil War, saw the passage of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to the Constitution, which abolished slavery and granted citizenship to former slaves. The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw the rise of industrialization, immigration, and urbanization. The United States emerged as a global power, with the Spanish-American War of 1898 marking its entry onto the world stage.\n\n### Rise as a superpower (1917–1945)\n\nThe United States entered World War I in 1917, and emerged as a global leader after the war. The Roaring Twenties, marked by economic prosperity and cultural transformation, followed. The Great Depression, which began in 1929, saw widespread economic hardship and social unrest. The United States entered World War II in 1941, and played a key role in the Allied victory.\n\n### Cold War (1945–1991)\n\nThe post-war period saw the rise of the Cold War, a decades-long conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union. The United States emerged as a superpower, with a strong economy and military. The Civil Rights Movement, led by figures such as Martin Luther King Jr., sought to end racial segregation and inequality. The Vietnam War, fought from 1955 to 1975, saw widespread protests and anti-war sentiment.\n\n### Contemporary (1991–present)\n\nThe end of the Cold War marked a period of relative peace and stability. The United States continued to expand its global influence, with the Gulf War of 1990-1991 and the War in Afghanistan of 2001-2021. The September 11 attacks of 2001 led to the War on Terror, with ongoing military interventions in the Middle East. The United States has continued to grapple with issues such as climate change, economic inequality, and social justice.\n\n**Geography**\n\n### Climate\n\nThe climate of the United States varies greatly, ranging from the tropical climate of Hawaii to the arctic climate of Alaska. The country experiences a range of weather patterns, including hurricanes, tornadoes, and blizzards.\n\n### Biodiversity and conservation\n\nThe United States is home to a diverse range of flora and fauna, including many endangered species.

The Democratic Party is generally associated with liberal policies, while the Republican Party is associated with conservative policies.\n\n### Subdivisions\n\nThe United States is divided into 50 states, a federal district, and several territories.

Wade, a landmark Supreme Court decision that established a woman's constitutional right to an abortion. The protests began in 2022 and have continued through 2024, with various groups and individuals expressing their opposition to abortion restrictions and advocating for reproductive rights.\n\n# Background\n\n## Leaked Draft Opinion\n\nIn May 2022, a leaked draft opinion from the Supreme Court of the United States revealed that the court was planning to overturn Roe v. Wade. The draft opinion, written by Justice Samuel Alito, argued that the Constitution did not explicitly protect a woman's right to an abortion and that the decision to overturn Roe v. Wade was a matter for the states to decide. The leak sparked widespread outrage and protests across the United States, with many people expressing their opposition to the potential overturning of Roe v. Wade.\n\n## Overturning of Roe v. Wade\n\nOn June 24, 2022, the Supreme Court issued its final opinion in the case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, which effectively overturned Roe v. Wade. The decision established that the Constitution did not protect a woman's right to an abortion and allowed individual states to regulate or ban abortion as they saw fit. The overturning of Roe v. Wade was seen as a major victory for anti-abortion groups and a major defeat for reproductive rights advocates.\n\n# Protests Before the Ruling\n\n## Midwest\n\nBefore the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, protests and demonstrations were already taking place across the United States. In the Midwest, protests were held in cities such as Chicago, Illinois, and Indianapolis, Indiana.

Born on January 6, 1412, in the village of Domremy, she led the French army to several victories, capturing key cities and fortifications from the English. Her bravery, conviction, and faith inspired a nation and have made her one of the most celebrated figures in French history.\n\n**Birth and Historical Background**\n\nJoan's birthplace, Domremy, was a small village in the province of Lorraine, which was under the control of the English. Her parents, Jacques and Isabelle Arc, were peasant farmers who lived a simple life on their farm. At the time, the Hundred Years' War between France and England was in its final stages, with the English ruling large parts of northern France. The French monarchy was in disarray, and the people were suffering under the English occupation.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nJoan's early life was marked by a strong sense of faith and a desire to serve France. She was raised in a devout Catholic household and was educated in the local village school. From a young age, she was known for her piety, her love of prayer, and her ability to hear voices from God. She believed that God spoke to her through these voices, guiding her on her path and giving her the strength to resist the English occupation.\n\n**Chinon**\n\nIn 1429, Joan traveled to the city of Vaucouleurs, where she petitioned the garrison commander, Robert de Baudricourt, for an escort to take her to the French court at Chinon. Baudricourt was skeptical of Joan's claims, but eventually, he agreed to provide her with a small group of soldiers to protect her on her journey.\n\nUpon arriving in Chinon, Joan was received by Charles VII, the King of France, who was impressed by her conviction and her determination to drive the English out of France. Charles VII asked Joan to lead the French army to Orléans, which was under siege by the English.\n\n**Military Campaigns**\n\n#### **Orléans**\n\nJoan's arrival at Orléans marked a turning point in the war. She led the French army in a series of attacks on the English positions, and after several weeks of fighting, the English were forced to abandon their siege. The city was liberated, and the French were able to regroup and prepare for further battles.\n\n#### **Loire Campaign**\n\nAfter the liberation of Orléans, Joan led the French army on a series of campaigns along the Loire River, capturing key cities and fortifications from the English. She also led a successful siege of the city of Jargeau, which was a major English stronghold.\n\n#### **Coronation and Siege of Paris**\n\nIn July 1429, Charles VII was crowned King of France in the Cathedral of Reims, with Joan in attendance. This marked a major victory for the French, and it was seen as a turning point in the war. However, the English were not defeated, and they continued to fight on.\n\nJoan then led the French army in a siege of the city of Paris, which was a major English stronghold. However, the siege was unsuccessful, and the English were able to defend the city.\n\n#### **Campaign against Perrinet Gressart**\n\nIn September 1429, Joan led the French army in a campaign against Perrinet Gressart, a French nobleman who had defected to the English. The campaign was successful, and Gressart was captured and executed.\n\n#### **Siege of Compiègne and Capture**\n\nIn May 1430, Joan led the French army in a siege of the city of Compiègne, which was under English control. However, the siege was unsuccessful, and Joan was captured by the Burgundians, who were allies of the English.\n\n**Trials and Execution**\n\n#### **Trial**\n\nJoan's trial began on January 23, 1431. She was charged with heresy, witchcraft, and cross-dressing, and she was subjected to intense ques", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The dynasty is said to have ruled over the region of Persia (modern-day Iran) before the advent of the Kayanian dynasty. The Pishdadian dynasty is also associated with the Zoroastrian tradition and is seen as a symbol of the ancient Persian values and culture.\n\n**Origins, Etymology and Sources**\n\nThe origins of the Pishdadian dynasty are shrouded in myth and legend. The name \"Pishdadian\" is derived from the Persian word \"Pishdad,\" which means \"first-born\" or \"ancestors.\" The dynasty is mentioned in several ancient sources, including the Shahnameh, the Tarikh al-Rusul wal-Muluk by al-Tabari, and the Persian historian Ferdowsi's book, Shahnameh.\n\n**The Shahnameh and Zoroastrian Tradition**\n\n### Overview\n\nThe Shahnameh is a Persian epic poem written by Ferdowsi in the 10th century. The poem is a comprehensive history of Persia from the mythical times to the Arab conquest in the 7th century. The Shahnameh is divided into five sections, with the Pishdadian dynasty being mentioned in the first section, called the \"Shahnameh-e Shah.\"\n\nThe Pishdadian dynasty is seen as a symbol of the ancient Persian values and culture, and is associated with the Zoroastrian tradition. The Zoroastrians believe in the dualism of good and evil, and the Pishdadian dynasty is seen as a representation of the good and just rulers who maintained the balance of the universe.\n\n### The Kings\n\nThe Pishdadian dynasty is said to have ruled over Persia for approximately 480 years, from the mythical king Jamshid to the last king, Zaw. The dynasty is divided into three generations, with the first generation being the kings from Jamshid to Faridun. The second generation includes the kings from Manuchehr to Sam. The third generation includes the kings from Zarthoshth to Zaw.\n\nThe kings of the Pishdadian dynasty are said to have been wise and just rulers, who maintained the balance of the universe and promoted the Zoroastrian values of good and evil. The kings are also associated with the creation of the Persian calendar and the establishment of the capital city of Persia, which is said to have been built by the king Jamshid.\n\n**Tabari and the Muslim Narratives**\n\n### The First Pishdadian Kings and the Conflict with Iblis\n\nAl-Tabari's book, Tarikh al-Rusul wal-Muluk, provides a different account of the Pishdadian dynasty. According to Tabari, the Pishdadian dynasty was founded by the first king, Jamshid, who was said to have been a descendant of the biblical figure, Cain. The dynasty is said to have been established after the fall of the mythical king, Iblis, who was said to have been the first ruler of Persia.\n\nThe early kings of the Pishdadian dynasty are said to have been involved in a conflict with Iblis, who was said to have been a tyrannical ruler. The conflict is said to have been resolved when the last king of the Pishdadian dynasty, Zaw, defeated Iblis and established the Kayanian dynasty.\n\n### From Jam al-Shidh to Zaw: al-Dahhak and War with the Turks\n\nAccording to Tabari, the Pishdadian dynasty continued to rule over Persia for several generations, with the last king being al-Dahhak. Al-Dahhak is said to have been a wise and just ruler, who maintained the balance of the universe and promoted the Zoroastrian values of good and evil.\n\nThe Pishdadian dynasty is said to have come to an end when al-Dahhak was defeated by the Turkish tribes, who established the Turkic dynasty in Persia. The defeat of al-Dahhak marked the end of the Pishdadian dynasty and the beginning of a new era in Persian history.\n\n**Significance**\n\nThe Pishdadian dynasty is significant in Persian mythology and history, as it represents the ancient Persian values and culture. The dynasty is associated with the Zoroastrian tradition and is seen as a symbol of the good and just rulers who maintained the balance of the universe.\n\nThe Pishdadian dynasty also played an important role in the development of the Persian calendar and the establishment of the capital city of Persia.

The counteroffensive, launched by the Ukrainian Armed Forces in September 2022, aimed to reclaim territories in the Kharkiv Oblast that had been occupied by Russian forces since the early stages of the war.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine, which began on 24 February 2022, marked the largest land war in Europe since World War II. The invasion was met with fierce resistance from the Ukrainian military, but Russian forces were able to make significant gains in the early stages of the conflict. By the summer of 2022, Russian forces had established a significant foothold in the Kharkiv Oblast, a region in northeastern Ukraine that borders Russia.\n\n**Prelude**\n\nIn the months leading up to the counteroffensive, Ukrainian forces had been conducting a series of small-scale attacks against Russian positions in the Kharkiv Oblast. These attacks, while largely unsuccessful, had allowed Ukrainian forces to gather intelligence on Russian troop movements and positions. Additionally, Ukrainian forces had been receiving significant amounts of military aid from Western countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada. This aid had helped to improve the capabilities of the Ukrainian military and had provided them with the resources necessary to launch a large-scale counteroffensive.\n\n**Counteroffensive**\n\nThe Ukrainian counteroffensive, which began on 6 September 2022, involved a series of coordinated attacks against Russian positions in the Kharkiv Oblast. The counteroffensive was launched along a 300-kilometer front, with Ukrainian forces attacking Russian positions in the north, east, and south of the region.\n\n#### **First phase (6–12 September 2022)**\n\nThe first phase of the counteroffensive saw Ukrainian forces making significant gains against Russian positions in the Kharkiv Oblast. On 6 September, Ukrainian forces launched a series of attacks against Russian positions in the Balakliya area, which had been a key stronghold for Russian forces in the region.

Ukrainian forces were able to make significant gains in the area, pushing Russian forces back and establishing a foothold in the region.\n\n##### **Breakthrough**\n\nOn 8 September, Ukrainian forces launched a series of attacks against Russian positions in the Kharkiv Oblast, breaking through Russian defenses and establishing a significant foothold in the region. Over the next 24 hours, Ukrainian forces were able to push Russian forces back and establish a significant advantage in the region.\n\n##### **Russian withdrawal from Kharkiv Oblast west of Oskil River**\n\nOn 9 September, Russian forces began to withdraw from the Kharkiv Oblast west of the Oskil River, which had been a key defensive line for Russian forces in the region. Ukrainian forces were able to pursue Russian forces, pushing them back and establishing a significant advantage in the region.\n\n##### **Other gains and casualties**\n\nOver the next 72 hours, Ukrainian forces continued to make significant gains against Russian positions in the Kharkiv Oblast. On 10 September, Ukrainian forces launched a series of attacks against Russian positions in the Kupyansk area, which had been a key stronghold for Russian forces in the region. Ukrainian forces were able to break through Russian defenses and establish a foothold in the area, pushing Russian forces back and establishing a significant advantage in the region.\n\n#### **Battle of Shevchenkove**\n\nOn 11 September, Ukrainian forces launched a series of attacks against Russian positions in the Shevchenkove area, which had been a key stronghold for Russian forces in the region. Ukrainian forces were able to break through Russian defenses and establish a foothold in the area, pushing Russian forces back and establishing a significant advantage in the region.\n\n#### **Second phase (13 September–1 October 2022)**\n\nThe second phase of the counteroffensive saw Ukrainian forces continuing to make significant gains against Russian positions in the Kharkiv Oblast. On 13 September, Ukrainian forces launched a series of attacks against Russian positions in the Lyman area, which had been a key stronghold for Russian forces in the region. Ukrainian forces were able to break through Russian defenses and establish a foothold in the area, pushing Russian forces back and establishing a significant advantage in the region.\n\n##### **Oskil River crossing**\n\nOn 14 September, Ukrainian forces launched a series of attacks against Russian positions on the eastern bank of the Oskil River, which had been a key defensive line for Russian forces in the region. Ukrainian forces were able to break through Russian defenses and establish a foothold on the eastern bank of the river, pushing Russian forces back and establishing a significant advantage in the region.\n\n##### **Encirclement and recapture of Lyman**\n\nOn 16 September, Ukrainian forces launched a series of attacks against Russian positions in the Lyman area, which had been a key stronghold for Russian forces in the region. Ukrainian forces were able to break through Russian defenses and establish a foothold in the area, pushing Russian forces back and establishing a significant advantage in the region.\n\n**Reactions**\n\n#### **Russia**\n\nThe Russian gover", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The film is the first installment in the Five Nights at Freddy's film series, based on the survival horror video game franchise of the same name. The film stars Elizabeth Lail, Josh Richards, and Piper Rubio, and follows a group of teenagers who are stalked by the vengeful animatronics from the Freddy Fazbear's Pizza restaurant.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film takes place in 1993, in the small town of Stanley, which is plagued by a series of mysterious disappearances and gruesome murders. The story centers around Heather, a high school student who is struggling to cope with the recent loss of her father. Heather's family has recently moved to Stanley, where they have taken over the local Freddy Fazbear's Pizza restaurant. The restaurant, which is a popular destination for families and children, has a dark history of accidents and fatalities.\n\nAs Heather begins to work at the restaurant, she discovers that the animatronics, including Freddy Fazbear, Bonnie the Bunny, Chica the Chicken, and Foxy the Pirate Fox, have a tendency to malfunction and become violent when no one is around. Heather soon realizes that the animatronics are not just simple machines, but are actually haunted by the vengeful spirits of children who were murdered at the restaurant.\n\nAs the night wears on, Heather and her friends are stalked by the animatronics, who seem to be determined to kill them. The group must use their wits and resourcefulness to survive the night and uncover the dark secrets behind the restaurant's deadly past.\n\n**Cast**\n\nThe film features a talented cast of young actors, including:\n\n* Elizabeth Lail as Heather, the protagonist of the film\n* Josh Richards as Mike, Heather's love interest and a fellow high school student\n* Piper Rubio as Emma, a shy and introverted high school student who becomes Heather's friend\n* Greg Bryk as William Afton, the owner of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza and a serial killer\n* Carrie-Anne Moss as Julie, a local police officer who is investigating the disappearances in Stanley\n\n**Production**\n\n### Development\n\nThe idea for the film was first conceived in 2015, when Seth Grahame-Smith and Chris McKenna began working on a script based on the Five Nights at Freddy's video game franchise. The project was initially intended to be a horror film, but it eventually evolved into a more complex and suspenseful thriller.\n\n### Casting\n\nThe casting process for the film was extensive, with the filmmakers holding auditions in several cities across the United States. Elizabeth Lail was cast as Heather after a series of chemistry reads with Josh Richards and Piper Rubio.\n\n### Filming\n\nPrincipal photography for the film took place over a period of six weeks in the summer of 2022. The film was shot on location in Ontario, Canada, with the production team using a combination of practical and CGI effects to bring the animatronics to life.\n\n### Music\n\nThe film's score was composed by Brian Tyler, who is known for his work on horror films such as The Exorcist and Halloween. The score is a haunting and atmospheric blend of electronic and orchestral elements, which perfectly captures the sense of tension and unease that pervades the film.\n\n**Release**\n\n### Marketing\n\nThe marketing campaign for the film was extensive, with the filmmakers releasing a series of teasers and trailers that hinted at the film's dark and suspenseful themes. The film's poster, which features Heather and the animatronics in a dramatic pose, was released in late 2022 and caused a stir on social media.\n\n### Home media\n\nThe film was released on DVD and Blu-ray in March 2023, with a special edition featuring behind-the-scenes footage and interviews with the cast and crew.\n\n**Reception**\n\n### Box office\n\nThe film was a commercial success, grossing over $150 million worldwide on its opening weekend. The film's success can be attributed to its well-crafted marketing campaign and its appeal to fans of the Five Nights at Freddy's video game franchise.\n\n### Critical response\n\nThe film received widespread critical acclaim, with many reviewers praising its suspenseful and atmospheric storyline, its well-developed characters, and its effective use of practical and CGI effects. The film holds a 92% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with many critics praising its ability to balance horror and suspense.\n\n### Accolades\n\nThe film was nominated for several awards, including the Saturn Award for Best Horror Film and the People's Choice Award for Favorite Horror Movie of 2023.\n\n**Sequel**\n\nA sequel to the film is currently in development, with Seth Grahame-Smith and Chris McKenna set to return as writers and producers.

The by-elections were held in 28 constituencies across the province, following the resignation of several lawmakers who had switched parties or were removed from their positions.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe by-elections were a result of the ongoing political crisis in the province, which had been plagued by defections and party switching by lawmakers in the preceding months. Several lawmakers had switched parties or resigned from their positions, leading to the need for by-elections to fill the vacant seats.\n\nThe by-elections were also seen as a test for the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, which had been facing challenges from opposition parties, particularly the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) (PML-N) and the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP).\n\n**Candidates**\n\nA total of 273 candidates contested the by-elections, representing various parties and independent candidates. The major parties contesting the by-elections included the PTI, PML-N, PPP, and the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) (JUI-F).\n\nSome notable candidates who contested the by-elections included:\n\n* Imran Khan, the former Prime Minister of Pakistan and chairman of the PTI, who contested the by-election in PP-147 Lahore.\n* Hamza Shehbaz, the leader of the opposition in the Punjab Assembly and a key figure in the PML-N, who contested the by-election in PP-123 Jhang.\n* Fawad Chaudhry, a senior leader of the PTI, who contested the by-election in PP-13 Gujrat.\n\n**Results**\n\nThe results of the by-elections were declared on 18 July 2022, with the PTI emerging as the largest winner, securing 14 seats.

They are typically found on the right side of the periodic table, with the exception of hydrogen, which is a nonmetal but is often placed in a separate category due to its unique properties.\n\n**Definition and Applicable Elements**\n\nNonmetals are defined as elements that do not exhibit the characteristic properties of metals, such as malleability, ductility, and the ability to conduct electricity. They are typically found in the p-block of the periodic table, with the exception of hydrogen, which is a nonmetal but is often placed in a separate category due to its unique properties.\n\nThe following elements are classified as nonmetals:\n\n* Hydrogen (H)\n* Carbon (C)\n* Nitrogen (N)\n* Oxygen (O)\n* Fluorine (F)\n* Neon (Ne)\n* Phosphorus (P)\n* Sulfur (S)\n* Chlorine (Cl)\n* Argon (Ar)\n* Selenium (Se)\n* Bromine (Br)\n* Krypton (Kr)\n* Tellurium (Te)\n* Iodine (I)\n* Xenon (Xe)\n\n**General Properties**\n\n### **Physical Properties**\n\nNonmetals are typically found in the p-block of the periodic table, and they exhibit a range of physical properties that distinguish them from metals.\n\n* **Molecular vs. Atomic**\n\nMost nonmetals exist as molecules, except for the noble gases, which exist as individual atoms. The molecular structure of nonmetals can vary widely, from simple molecules like hydrogen and oxygen to complex molecules like carbon dioxide and sulfuric acid.\n\n* **Phase transitions**\n\nNonmetals exhibit a range of phase transitions, including solidification, melting, and sublimation. The melting and boiling points of nonmetals can vary widely, depending on the element and its molecular structure.\n\n### **Allotropes**\n\nMany nonmetals exhibit allotropy, which is the existence of multiple forms of an element. The most well-known example of allotropy is carbon, which exists in several different forms, including diamond, graphite, and fullerenes.\n\n* **Diamond**\n\nDiamond is a crystalline form of carbon that is extremely hard and has a high melting point. It is used in a variety of applications, including cutting tools and jewelry.\n\n* **Graphite**\n\nGraphite is a soft, crystalline form of carbon that is used as a lubricant and in a variety of other applications.\n\n* **Fullerenes**\n\nFullerenes are a class of molecules that are composed of carbon atoms arranged in a spherical or cylindrical shape. They are highly stable and have a range of potential applications.\n\n**Chemical Properties**\n\nNonmetals exhibit a range of chemical properties that distinguish them from metals.\n\n* **Oxidation states**\n\nNonmetals can exhibit a range of oxidation states, from -1 to +7.

Desperate to find a cure, Morbius turns to an untested and highly experimental treatment that involves injecting a serum into his blood. The serum, which is based on the blood of a bat, has the potential to cure Morbius's disorder, but it also comes with a terrible cost.\n\nAs Morbius undergoes the treatment, he experiences a series of strange and terrifying side effects. He begins to feel an intense thirst for blood and a heightened sense of sensitivity to sunlight. Despite his growing unease, Morbius is convinced that the treatment is worth the risk, and he continues to undergo the process.\n\nHowever, as the treatment progresses, Morbius's condition worsens, and he begins to undergo a transformation. He develops fangs, claws, and a heightened sense of strength and agility.
