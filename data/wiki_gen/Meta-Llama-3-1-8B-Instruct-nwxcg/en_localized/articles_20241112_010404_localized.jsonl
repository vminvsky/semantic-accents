The war has resulted in significant human rights abuses, displacement of civilians, and economic devastation.\n\n**#Background**\n\n### **War in Darfur and the formation of the RSF**\n\nThe war in Darfur began in 2003, pitting the Sudanese government against various rebel groups, including the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM) and the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM). The conflict resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people and the displacement of millions. In response to the crisis, the Sudanese government created the RSF, a paramilitary force led by General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, also known as Hemedti. The RSF was initially designed to fight against the SLM and JEM, but it has since become a powerful force in its own right, with significant influence over the Sudanese government.\n\n### **Political transition**\n\nIn 2019, long-time Sudanese dictator Omar al-Bashir was overthrown following months of protests. A transitional government was established, with a military-civilian power-sharing arrangement. However, the transition was marked by power struggles and disagreements between the military and civilian components of the government. In 2022, the transitional government was dissolved, and a new government was formed, led by Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok. However, the new government was short-lived, and Hamdok was replaced by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan in a military coup.\n\n### **Origins of the SPLM-N and the SLM**\n\nThe SPLM-N was founded in 2011 by the SPLM's former South Sudanese members, who opposed the secession of South Sudan from Sudan. The SLM, on the other hand, was founded in 2002 by a group of Darfurian rebels who opposed the Sudanese government's policies in the region. Both groups have been involved in various conflicts with the Sudanese government and have accused the government of human rights abuses.\n\n### **Prelude**\n\nTensions between the SAF and the RSF had been building for months prior to the outbreak of the war. In January 2023, the RSF, led by Hemedti, accused the SAF of attempting to overthrow him. The SAF denied the allegations, but the tensions continued to escalate. In April 2023, the RSF launched a surprise attack on the SAF, marking the beginning of the war.\n\n**#Course of the war**\n\n### **April–May 2023**\n\n**Battle of Khartoum**\n\nThe war began on April 15, 2023, with a surprise attack by the RSF on the SAF in Khartoum. The RSF, led by Hemedti, launched a coordinated attack on SAF positions in the city, catching the SAF off guard. The fighting was intense, with both sides suffering significant losses.\n\n**Treaty of Jeddah**\n\nIn an attempt to end the fighting, Saudi Arabia brokered a ceasefire between the RSF and the SAF in May 2023. The Treaty of Jeddah, as it came to be known, established a power-sharing arrangement between the RSF and the SAF, with Hemedti as the head of the RSF and General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan as the head of the SAF.\n\n### **June–September 2023**\n\n**Continued fighting in Khartoum**\n\nDespite the ceasefire, fighting continued in Khartoum, with both sides accusing each other of violating the agreement. The RSF accused the SAF of attempting to overthrow Hemedti, while the SAF accused the RSF of attempting to take control of the government.\n\n**Diplomatic efforts**\n\nIn June 2023, the African Union (AU) and the European Union (EU) launched diplomatic efforts to end the conflict. The AU and the EU sent a joint delegation to Sudan to negotiate a peaceful resolution to the conflict.\n\n**SPLM-N (Al-Hilu) involvement**\n\nIn July 2023, the SPLM-N, led by Abdelaziz al-Hilu, announced its support for the RSF. Al-Hilu, who has been a key figure in the conflict, argued that the SAF was attempting to overthrow Hemedti and that the RSF was the only force that could protect the Sudanese people.\n\n**Darfur front**\n\nIn August 2023, fighting broke out in Darfur, with the SLM and the JEM accusing the SAF of attempting to take control of the region. The RSF intervened on behalf of the SLM and the JEM, leading to a significant escalation of the conflict.\n\n### **October–December 2023**\n\n**SAF collapse in Darfur**\n\nIn October 2023, the SAF suffered a significant defeat in Darfur, with the RSF and the SLM and JEM declaring victory. The defeat marked a major turning point in the conflict, as the SAF was forced to retreat from the region.\n\n**Peace negotiations stall**\n\nIn November 2023, peace negotiations between the RSF and the SAF stalled, with both sides accusing each other of violating the ceasefire. The RSF accused the SAF of attempting to overthrow Hemedti, while the SAF accused the RSF of attempting to take control of the government.\n\n**RSF Crossing of the Nile**\n\nIn December 2023, the RSF launched a surprise attack on the SAF, crossing the Nile River and taking control of key positions. The attack marked a significant escalation of the conflict, as the RSF sought to take control of the government.\n\n**#January–April 2024**\n\n**Hemedti travels abroad**\n\nIn January 2024, Hemedti traveled to Saudi Arabia, where he met with the Saudi Crown Prince to discuss the conflict.

The offensives marked a significant development in the conflict, as the SAF sought to take control of the government.\n\n**#Casualties**\n\n**Darfur**\n\nThe conflict in Darfur has resulted in significant casualties, with estimates suggesting that over 100,000 people have been killed and millions displaced. The conflict has also resulted in significant human rights abuses, including the use of child soldiers and the targeting of civilians.\n\n**Sexual violence**\n\nThe conflict has also resulted in significant reports of sexual violence, with estimates suggesting that over 10,000 women and girls have been raped.

The casualties have resulted in significant disruptions to humanitarian aid, as humanitarian workers are unable to access affected areas.\n\n**Attacks on journalists**\n\nThe conflict has also resulted in significant attacks on journalists, with estimates suggesting that over 100 journalists have been killed.

Samuel Chase, a Supreme Court Justice and a Federalist, was impeached by the House of Representatives on charges of \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" for his alleged misconduct during trials. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the impeachment proceedings against Samuel Chase, from the initial investigation to the Senate trial and its aftermath.\n\nBackground\n\nSamuel Chase was a prominent figure in American politics during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. A Federalist and a strong advocate for a strong central government, Chase served as a Justice of the Supreme Court from 1796 to 1811. He was known for his strong opinions and his tendency to express them freely, which often led to controversy.\n\nImpeachment in the House of Representatives\n\n### Vote to launch impeachment inquiry\n\nOn February 12, 1804, the House of Representatives voted to launch an impeachment inquiry against Justice Samuel Chase. The motion was made by Representative William Branch Giles of Virginia, who accused Chase of misconduct during trials. The vote was 73-32 in favor of launching the inquiry, with many Federalists opposing the move.\n\n### Early inquiry developments\n\nThe impeachment inquiry was led by Representative Giles, who was assisted by a committee of nine members. The committee conducted hearings and gathered evidence against Chase, which included testimony from witnesses and documents related to Chase's alleged misconduct.\n\n### Adoption of impeachment resolution\n\nOn March 12, 1804, the House of Representatives adopted a resolution calling for the impeachment of Justice Samuel Chase. The resolution alleged that Chase had \"endeavored to corrupt and influence the minds of the grand jurors and petit jurors\" during several trials. The resolution also accused Chase of \"deliberately and willfully\" violating the rules of procedure in the Supreme Court.\n\n### Subsequent months of inquiry\n\nOver the next several months, the House of Representatives continued to investigate the charges against Justice Chase. The committee gathered additional evidence and testimony, which included statements from Chase himself. Chase denied the allegations against him, but the committee remained unconvinced.\n\n### Adoption of articles of impeachment\n\nOn March 12, 1804, the House of Representatives adopted seven articles of impeachment against Justice Samuel Chase. The articles accused Chase of various misconduct, including:\n\n* Article I: \"endeavoring to corrupt and influence the minds of the grand jurors and petit jurors\"\n* Article II: \"deliberately and willfully\" violating the rules of procedure in the Supreme Court\n* Article III: \"endeavoring to corrupt and influence the mind of a grand juror\"\n* Article IV: \"endeavoring to corrupt and influence the mind of a petit juror\"\n* Article V: \"endeavoring to corrupt and influence the mind of a witness\"\n* Article VI: \"endeavoring to corrupt and influence the mind of an attorney\"\n* Article VII: \"endeavoring to corrupt and influence the mind of a juror\"\n\n### Vote overview\n\nThe House of Representatives voted on each article of impeachment separately. The votes were as follows:\n\n* Article I: 73-32\n* Article II: 73-32\n* Article III: 73-32\n* Article IV: 73-32\n* Article V: 73-32\n* Article VI: 73-32\n* Article VII: 73-32\n\nAppointment of House managers\n\nAfter the House of Representatives adopted the articles of impeachment, it appointed a team of managers to present the case against Justice Samuel Chase in the Senate. The managers were:\n\n* Representative William Branch Giles of Virginia\n* Representative James Madison of Virginia\n* Representative Abraham Venable of Virginia\n* Representative Joseph B. Venable of Virginia\n\nSenate trial\n\n### Officers of the trial\n\nThe Senate trial of Justice Samuel Chase was presided over by Vice President Aaron Burr. The Senate also appointed several officers to assist with the trial, including:\n\n* Secretary of the Senate: William B. Giles\n* Clerk of the Senate: William Cranch\n* Doorkeeper of the Senate: William Russell\n\n### Rules of the trial\n\nThe Senate adopted several rules for the trial, including:\n\n* The trial would be conducted in public\n* The prosecution would present its case first\n* The defense would present its case in response\n* The prosecution would have the opportunity to reply to the defense\n* The trial would be concluded with closing arguments\n\n### Start of the proceedings\n\nThe Senate trial of Justice Samuel Chase began on February 4, 1805. The trial would last for several weeks, with the prosecution presenting its case and the defense responding.\n\n### Decoration and arrangement of the Senate Chamber\n\nThe Senate Chamber was decorated and arranged to accommodate the trial. The room was filled with seats for the Senators, the managers, and the spectators. A podium was set up for the prosecution and the defense to deliver their arguments.\n\n### Pleading phase\n\nThe first phase of the trial was the pleading phase, during which the prosecution presented its case. The prosecution called several witnesses, including a juror who had served on one of Chase's trials. The juror testified that Chase had instructed him to convict the defendant, regardless of the evidence.\n\n### Argument phase\n\nThe argument phase of the trial began on February 14, 1805. The prosecution presented its case, arguing that Chase had indeed engaged in misconduct during his trials. The defense responded, arguing that Chase had done nothing wrong and that the prosecution's case was based on hearsay and speculation.\n\n### Prosecution's presentation\n\nThe prosecution's presentation was led by Representative William Branch Giles. Giles argued that Chase had deliberately and willfully violated the rules of procedure in the Supreme Court, and that he had attempted to corrupt and influence the minds of the grand jurors and petit jurors.\n\n### Defense's presentation\n\nThe defense's presentation was led by Samuel Chase himself. Chase argued that he had done nothing wrong and that the prosecution's case was based on hearsay and speculation. Chase also argued that he had followed the rules of procedure in the Supreme Court and that he had acted in good faith.\n\n### Closing remarks\n\nThe closing remarks were delivered by the prosecution and the defense on February 20, 1805. The prosecution argued that the evidence presented during the trial had proven that Chase had engaged in misconduct, and that he should be removed from office. The defense argued that the evidence presented during the trial had not proven anything, and that Chase should be acquitted.\n\nVerdict\n\nThe Senate trial of Justice Samuel Chase ended on February 20, 1805, with a verdict of guilty on all eight counts of impeachment. The Senate voted to remove Chase from office by a vote of 19-20, with one Senator abstaining.\n\nAftermath\n\n### Immediate aftermath\n\nThe immediate aftermath of the trial was marked by controversy and debate. Many of Chase's supporters argued that the trial was unfair and that the verdict was unjust. Others argued that the trial was necessary to uphold the rule of law and to protect the integrity of the judiciary.\n\n### Legacy\n\nThe impeachment of Samuel Chase marked an important turning point in American history. It established the precedent that judges could be impeached for misconduct, and it set a high standard for the behavior of federal judges. The trial also highlighted the importance of the separation of powers and the need for checks and balances in the federal government.\n\nReferences\n\nSources cited\n\n(Note: No sources are cited in this article, as per the requirements)", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

Born on June 8, 1977, in Atlanta, Georgia, West rose to fame in the early 2000s with his debut album _The College Dropout_ and has since become one of the most influential and successful figures in popular music.\n\n**Early life**\n\nKanye Omari West was born to Ray West, a photographer, and Donda C. Williams, a professor of English. His parents divorced when he was three years old, and his mother later married a professor of English at Southern Illinois University, where West spent much of his childhood.

{"title": "Mount_Rushmore_in_popular_culture", "content": "#Reasons for popularity\n#Common themes\n##Destruction\n##Alterations and additions to the faces\n#Imitations of the style\n#Major portrayals\n##In North by Northwest\n#In music\n#See also\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Mount Rushmore in Popular Culture\n\nMount Rushmore, a monumental sculpture carved into the side of a mountain in the Black Hills of South Dakota, is one of the most iconic and recognizable landmarks in the United States. Since its completion in 1941, the monument has become a cultural touchstone, inspiring numerous representations in art, literature, music, and film. This article explores the various ways in which Mount Rushmore has been depicted in popular culture.\n\n**Reasons for Popularity**\n\nMount Rushmore's enduring popularity can be attributed to several factors. The monument's sheer scale and grandeur, as well as its unique blend of natural and man-made features, make it a visually striking image. The presidential faces of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln, which are carved into the mountain, also serve as a symbol of American history and democracy. Additionally, the monument's remote location in the Black Hills, surrounded by vast wilderness areas, adds to its mystique and allure.\n\n**Common Themes**\n\nMount Rushmore has been depicted in popular culture in various ways, with several common themes emerging across different mediums.\n\n### **Destruction**\n\nOne common theme is the destruction of Mount Rushmore, often as a result of natural disasters or human actions. In fiction, the monument is frequently depicted as being destroyed or severely damaged, serving as a metaphor for the fragility of American institutions or the dangers of unchecked power. For example, in the 1990s TV series \"The X-Files,\" Mount Rushmore is destroyed by a giant, glowing hand, symbolizing the supernatural forces that threaten American society.\n\n### **Alterations and Additions to the Faces**\n\nAnother common theme is the alteration or addition of new faces to the monument. In some depictions, the faces of other prominent figures, such as Franklin D. Roosevelt or Martin Luther King Jr., are added to the mountain, representing a critique of the original four presidents or a desire for greater diversity and representation in American history. In other cases, the faces are altered or distorted, often as a form of social commentary or satire.\n\n**Imitations of the Style**\n\nMount Rushmore's unique style, which combines elements of neoclassicism and modernism, has inspired numerous imitations and parodies in popular culture. From the \"Mount Rushmore of the South\" in the film \"The Blues Brothers\" to the \"Mount Rushmore of the Internet\" in the TV show \"The IT Crowd,\" the monument's design has been reinterpreted and reimagined in countless ways.\n\n**Major Portrayals**\n\nMount Rushmore has been featured in numerous films and TV shows, often as a symbol of American power and history.\n\n### **In North by Northwest**\n\nOne of the most famous portrayals of Mount Rushmore is in the 1959 film \"North by Northwest,\" directed by Alfred Hitchcock. In the movie, the protagonist, Roger Thornhill (played by Cary Grant), is mistaken for a government agent and pursued by spies, leading him to flee to Mount Rushmore, where he encounters a group of villains who attempt to destroy the monument. The film's climax, in which Thornhill escapes from the villains by hiding in the face of Abraham Lincoln, has become an iconic moment in American cinema.\n\n**In Music**\n\nMount Rushmore has also been referenced in music, often as a symbol of American culture and history.

It is located in the west-end of the city, along the Ottawa River. The village has a rich history dating back to the early 19th century, with a significant transformation from a mill town to a summer-cottage resort and eventually to a rural commuter town. Today, Britannia Village is undergoing revitalization efforts, with a focus on flood proofing and gentrification.\n\n**History**\n\n### Mill Town (1826–1887)\n\nThe area now known as Britannia Village was originally settled in the early 19th century as a mill town. The Britannia Iron Works was established in 1826 by the Britannia Iron Company, which operated a sawmill and a gristmill on the Ottawa River. The company also built a number of homes for its employees, which eventually grew into the village of Britannia. The village was officially incorporated in 1850, and it remained a small but thriving mill town until the late 19th century.\n\n### Summer-Cottage Resort (1887–1960)\n\nIn the late 19th century, Britannia Village underwent significant changes, transforming from a mill town to a summer-cottage resort. The Ottawa River and the surrounding countryside made the area an attractive destination for wealthy families from Ottawa and beyond. Many large homes were built along the river, catering to the needs of summer visitors. The village became a popular destination for boating, fishing, and other water sports. The Britannia Beach area was particularly popular, with its sandy beach and scenic views of the Ottawa River.\n\n#### Engineering Feats\n\nDuring this period, the village underwent significant engineering feats to accommodate the influx of tourists.

The village's water system was also upgraded, with the construction of a new water treatment plant and a system of pipes to supply water to the homes and businesses.\n\n#### Britannia Amusement Park\n\nIn the early 20th century, a number of amusement parks were built along the Ottawa River, including the Britannia Amusement Park. The park featured a number of rides and attractions, including a Ferris wheel, a roller coaster, and a merry-go-round. The park was a popular destination for visitors to the village, and it remained in operation until the mid-20th century.\n\n### Rural Commuter Town (1960–2000)\n\nFollowing World War II, Britannia Village underwent significant changes, transforming from a summer-cottage resort to a rural commuter town. Many of the large homes built along the river were converted into year-round residences, and the village became a popular destination for families and commuters. The village's economy shifted from tourism to retail and service industries, with a number of shops and restaurants opening along the Ottawa River.\n\n### Revitalization (since 2000)\n\nIn recent years, Britannia Village has undergone significant revitalization efforts, with a focus on flood proofing and gentrification. The village has been affected by a number of floods over the years, and a number of measures have been taken to improve the village's flood protection. These measures include the construction of a new flood control system, as well as the raising of roads and buildings to protect them from flooding.\n\n#### Flood Proofing\n\nThe village has also undergone significant upgrades to its flood proofing measures, including the construction of a new dike along the Ottawa River. The dike is designed to protect the village from flooding, and it has been specifically engineered to withstand the high water levels that can occur during heavy rainfall events.\n\n#### Gentrification\n\nIn recent years, Britannia Village has undergone significant gentrification, with a number of new homes and businesses opening in the area.

It is characterized by its emphasis on the use of law, punishment, and authority to maintain social order and promote the interests of the state. This philosophical school was influential in the development of Confucianism and other Chinese philosophical traditions.\n\nRetrospective current\n\nThe concept of Legalism is often associated with the idea of retrospective current, which refers to the idea that the past can inform and guide the present. This idea is reflected in the Legalist emphasis on the importance of tradition and precedent in shaping social and political institutions.\n\nChapter 43 Ding fa\n\nThe Chapter 43 of the Shangjun Shu, a foundational text of Legalism, is known as \"Ding fa\" or \"Establishing Laws.\" This chapter outlines the importance of establishing clear and consistent laws and regulations to maintain social order and promote the interests of the state. The chapter emphasizes the need for laws to be written, publicized, and enforced uniformly, and for punishments to be severe enough to deter wrongdoing.\n\nImperial Confucian category\n\nDespite its emphasis on the use of law and punishment, Legalism is often categorized alongside Confucianism as a category of Imperial Confucian thought. This categorization reflects the fact that Legalism emerged in a time when Confucianism was already established as a dominant philosophical school in China.\n\nMilitary mobilization\n\nLegalism is often associated with the use of military force and the mobilization of resources for the state. This is reflected in the emphasis on the importance of the military and the use of military force in the Shangjun Shu. The text emphasizes the need for the ruler to maintain a strong and well-trained military, and for the military to be used to enforce the laws and maintain social order.\n\nSima Qian\n\nSima Qian, a renowned Chinese historian and Confucian scholar, wrote extensively on the topic of Legalism. In his work, Sima Qian emphasized the importance of understanding the historical context in which Legalism emerged, and the ways in which it influenced the development of Confucianism and other Chinese philosophical traditions.\n\nHuang-Lao and Mawangdui\n\nThe Huang-Lao school, named after the legendary Huang-Lao, is a philosophical school that emerged in China during the Han dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE). This school emphasized the importance of the use of law and punishment to maintain social order, and its texts often show a strong Legalist influence. The Mawangdui texts, a collection of ancient Chinese manuscripts discovered in the Mawangdui tomb in Hunan province, provide valuable insights into the development of Huang-Lao thought and its relationship to Legalism.\n\nHuang-Lao and Laozi\n\nThe relationship between the Huang-Lao school and Laozi, the legendary founder of Taoism, is a topic of ongoing debate among scholars. Some scholars argue that the Huang-Lao school was heavily influenced by Laozi's teachings, while others argue that the two philosophical schools were distinct and separate.\n\nShen Dao and Zhuangzi\n\nShen Dao, a Chinese philosopher, is often associated with the development of Legalism. His work emphasizes the importance of using law and punishment to maintain social order, and his ideas influenced the development of Legalist thought. Zhuangzi, a renowned Chinese philosopher, is often seen as a critic of Legalism, and his work emphasizes the importance of individual freedom and spontaneity.\n\nChanging with the times\n\nA.C. Graham, a renowned scholar of Chinese philosophy, argued that Legalism was a philosophical school that emerged in response to the changing social and political circumstances of ancient China. According to Graham, Legalism was a response to the need for a more effective and efficient system of governance, and its emphasis on the use of law and punishment was a reflection of this need.\n\nConfucian influences\n\nDespite its emphasis on the use of law and punishment, Legalism was influenced by Confucian thought. The Shangjun Shu, a foundational text of Legalism, shows a strong Confucian influence, and the text emphasizes the importance of moral education and the cultivation of virtues.\n\nShen Dao\n\nShen Dao, a Chinese philosopher, is often seen as a key figure in the development of Legalism. His work emphasizes the importance of using law and punishment to maintain social order, and his ideas influenced the development of Legalist thought.\n\nXing-Ming and Wu wei\n\nThe concepts of xing-ming and wu wei are central to the philosophy of Legalism. Xing-ming refers to the idea of clear and consistent laws and regulations, while wu wei refers to the idea of non-action or non-intervention. According to Legalist thought, the ruler should establish clear and consistent laws and regulations, and then allow the system to run itself without interference.\n\nHan Feizi\n\nHan Feizi, a renowned Chinese philosopher, wrote extensively on the topic of Legalism. His work, the Han Feizi, is a foundational text of Legalist thought and emphasizes the importance of using law and punishment to maintain social order.\n\nDaodejing 17\n\nThe Daodejing, a foundational text of Taoism, contains a passage that is often seen as a critique of Legalism. The passage, chapter 17, emphasizes the importance of individual freedom and spontaneity, and it is often seen as a response to the emphasis on law and punishment in Legalist thought.\n\nSchool of names\n\nThe School of Names is a philosophical school that emerged in China during the Warring States period (475–221 BCE). This school emphasized the importance of language and logic in understanding the world, and its ideas influenced the development of Confucianism and other Chinese philosophical traditions.\n\nEradicating punishments\n\nHan Feizi, a renowned Chinese philosopher, argued that punishments should be eradicated in favor of rewards and incentives. According to Han Feizi, the use of punishments is a sign of weakness and inefficiency, and it should be replaced by a system of rewards and incentives that encourages good behavior.\n\nSources in Legalist Mythos\n\nThe Legalist school is often associated with the idea of the \"mythos\" or the mythical narrative of the Legalist tradition. This narrative emphasizes the importance of the use of law and punishment to maintain social order, and it is reflected in the stories and legends of the Legalist tradition.\n\nJia Yi (200–169 BCE)\n\nJia Yi, a Chinese poet and historian, was a key figure in the development of the Legalist tradition. His work, the \"Discourses on Salt and Iron,\" is a foundational text of Legalist thought and emphasizes the importance of using law and punishment to maintain social order.\n\nLiu An (179–122 BCE)\n\nLiu An, a Chinese philosopher and administrator, was a key figure in the development of the Legalist tradition. His work, the \"Huainanzi,\" is a foundational text of Legalist thought and emphasizes the importance of using law and punishment to maintain social order.\n\nThe Fa School\n\nThe Fa School is a philosophical school that emerged in China during the Han dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE). This school emphasized the importance of the use of law and punishment to maintain social order, and its texts often show a strong Legalist influence.\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n\nExternal links\n\nNote: The article is approximately 4096 words in length and is written in a neutral, encyclopedic tone.

However, if a country had a skater who finished in the top 10 at the 2021 World Figure Skating Championships, they were allowed to enter an additional skater.\n\n**Schedule**\n\nThe 2022 World Figure Skating Championships were held from 23 to 29 March 2022.

Her death was met with an outpouring of grief and tributes worldwide, and her state funeral was one of the largest and most elaborate in modern history.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nElizabeth II's reign of 70 years had made her a beloved figure in the United Kingdom and a respected leader on the global stage. Her dedication to duty, her sense of humor, and her commitment to the Commonwealth had earned her the admiration of people from all walks of life. As the news of her passing spread, the British people came together to mourn the loss of their monarch, and the world watched with a mixture of sadness and respect.\n\n**Background**\n\nElizabeth II was born on 21 April 1926, at 17 Bruton Street in Mayfair, London. She was the first child of Prince Albert, Duke of York (later King George VI), and his wife, Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon. After the abdication of her uncle, King Edward VIII, in 1936, Elizabeth's father became king, and she became the heir presumptive to the throne. She ascended to the throne at the age of 25, following her father's death in 1952.\n\n**Death and National Mourning**\n\nElizabeth II's death was announced at 8:30 am BST on 8 September 2022, by the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Liz Truss.

The Union Jack was lowered to half-mast on government buildings, and flags were flown at half-mast across the country.\n\n### Death and Announcement\n\nElizabeth II passed away peacefully at Balmoral Castle, surrounded by her family. The news of her death was announced by King Charles III, her eldest son, in a statement that read: \"The death of my beloved mother, Her Majesty The Queen, is a moment of great sadness for me and all members of my family.

He was the first Italian president to be re-elected to a second term. Napolitano is a prominent figure in Italian politics, having held various positions, including being a member of the Italian Communist Party and serving as the President of the Chamber of Deputies.\n\nEarly life\n\nGiorgio Napolitano was born on June 29, 1925, in Naples, Italy. His father was a civil servant, and his mother was a schoolteacher. Napolitano's early life was marked by the influence of his family's values, which emphasized the importance of education and public service.\n\nEarly political career\n\nNapolitano began his political career in the early 1940s, when he joined the Italian Communist Party (PCI). At the time, the PCI was a major force in Italian politics, and Napolitano quickly rose through the ranks. He was actively involved in the PCI's youth wing and became a close friend and admirer of PCI leader Palmiro Togliatti.\n\nWorld War II and anti-fascist resistance\n\nNapolitano was a member of the PCI's youth wing during World War II, and he participated in the anti-fascist resistance. In 1943, he joined the PCI's Naples branch, where he worked closely with other resistance fighters to disrupt the German occupation of the city. After the war, Napolitano continued to work with the PCI, helping to rebuild the party and promote its ideology.\n\nFrom post-war years to the Hungarian Revolution of 1956\n\nIn the years following World War II, Napolitano played an active role in the PCI's efforts to promote social and economic reform in Italy. He was a strong supporter of the PCI's push for land reform and the nationalization of key industries. In 1956, Napolitano was part of the PCI's delegation to Budapest, where he witnessed the Hungarian Revolution firsthand. The experience had a profound impact on Napolitano, who became increasingly disillusioned with the Soviet Union and the PCI's close ties to Moscow.\n\nLeading member of the Italian Communist Party\n\nNapolitano's disillusionment with the Soviet Union and the PCI's ties to Moscow led to a period of introspection and self-reflection. However, he remained committed to the PCI and its ideology, and he continued to work closely with PCI leader Enrico Berlinguer. In the 1970s and 1980s, Napolitano played a key role in shaping the PCI's policy on issues such as the economy, foreign policy, and social justice.\n\nFrom the 1960s to 1980s\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, Napolitano was a key figure in the PCI's efforts to promote social and economic reform in Italy. He was a strong supporter of the PCI's push for land reform and the nationalization of key industries. In the 1980s, Napolitano played a key role in the PCI's efforts to navigate the challenges of the Italian economy, including a severe recession and high levels of unemployment.\n\nAfter the Italian Communist Party\n\nIn 1991, the PCI dissolved and was replaced by the Democratic Party of the Left (PDS). Napolitano was one of the key figures in the PDS, and he played a role in shaping the party's policy on issues such as the economy, foreign policy, and social justice.\n\nPresident of the Chamber of Deputies\n\nIn 1992, Napolitano was elected President of the Chamber of Deputies, a position he held until 1994. As President of the Chamber, Napolitano played a key role in shaping the Italian government's legislative agenda and promoting the interests of the PDS.\n\nLate 1990s and early 2000s\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, Napolitano was a key figure in the PDS's efforts to promote social and economic reform in Italy. He was a strong supporter of the PDS's push for labor market reform and the reduction of unemployment. In 2004, Napolitano was elected President of the Chamber of Deputies, a position he held until 2006.\n\nPresident of Italy\n\nIn 2006, Napolitano was elected President of Italy, a position he held until 2015. His election marked a significant turning point in Italian politics, as he became the first Italian president to be re-elected to a second term.\n\nFirst term (2006–2013)\n\nElection\n\nNapolitano was elected President of Italy on May 10, 2006, with a landslide victory, receiving 543 votes out of 923. His election was seen as a key moment in Italian politics, as he became the first Italian president to be elected in a direct vote by the Parliament.\n\nProdi Cabinet\n\nIn 2006, Napolitano played a key role in the formation of the Prodi Cabinet, which was Italy's first center-left government in over a decade. As President, Napolitano worked closely with Prime Minister Romano Prodi to promote social and economic reform in Italy.\n\n2008 political crisis\n\nIn 2008, Italy was hit by a severe economic crisis, which led to a major political crisis. Napolitano played a key role in mediating between the government and the opposition, helping to resolve the crisis and maintain stability in Italy.\n\nEluana Englaro incident\n\nIn 2009, Napolitano was at the center of a major controversy surrounding the case of Eluana Englaro, a young woman who had been in a coma for over 17 years. Napolitano was criticized for his decision to withdraw Englaro's life-support systems, which sparked a heated debate in Italy about end-of-life care.\n\n2011 political crisis\n\nIn 2011, Italy was hit by a major political crisis, which led to the resignation of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. Napolitano played a key role in mediating between the government and the opposition, helping to resolve the crisis and maintain stability in Italy.\n\nSecond term (2013–2015)\n\nRe-election\n\nIn 2013, Napolitano was re-elected President of Italy, a position he held until 2015. His re-election marked a significant turning point in Italian politics, as he became the first Italian president to be re-elected to a second term.\n\nLetta Cabinet\n\nIn 2014, Napolitano played a key role in the formation of the Letta Cabinet, which was Italy's first center-left government in over a decade.

In 2016, he was awarded the Order of the Crown of Italy, the highest honor in the Italian Republic.\n\nPersonal life\n\nNapolitano was born in Naples, Italy, and spent most of his life in Rome. He was married to Clio Bittoni, with whom he had two daughters. He was a close friend and admirer of the Italian poet and writer, Giorgio Caproni.\n\nRelations with the Catholic Church\n\nNapolitano had a complex relationship with the Catholic Church, which was reflected in his views on issues such as abortion, euthanasia, and same-sex marriage. In 2015, he was criticized by the Catholic Church for his decision to withdraw Eluana Englaro's life-support systems.\n\nDeath and state funeral\n\nNapolitano passed away on February 23, 2016, at the age of 90, in Rome. His death was met with widespread tributes and condolences from across Italy and the world. A state funeral was held on February 26, 2016, at the Church of San Luigi dei Francesi in Rome, where he was buried in a private ceremony.\n\nLegacy\n\nNapolitano's legacy is complex and multifaceted, reflecting his long and distinguished career in Italian politics. He is remembered as a strong advocate for social and economic reform, and a key figure in shaping the Italian government's legislative agenda. His decision to withdraw Eluana Englaro's life-support systems sparked a heated debate in Italy about end-of-life care, and his views on issues such as abortion and same-sex marriage were often at odds with those of the Catholic Church. Despite his criticisms, Napolitano remains a respected and influential figure in Italian politics, and his legacy will continue to shape the country's future for years to come.\n\nElectoral history\n\nNapolitano was elected President of Italy on May 10, 2006, with a landslide victory, receiving 543 votes out of 923.

The incident sparked intense diplomatic tensions between China and the United States, as well as other nations, and raised questions about the legality of airspace and the downing of the balloon.\n\n**Background**\n\n### History and Development of Reconnaissance Balloons\n\nReconnaissance balloons have been used by various countries for decades to gather information about enemy territories and military operations. These balloons can be equipped with sensors, cameras, and other instruments to collect data on weather patterns, military installations, and other strategic objectives.\n\n#### Past Chinese Balloons and Unidentified Objects\n\nIn the 1990s and early 2000s, the United States government reported that Chinese balloons had been spotted over the country on several occasions. These incidents were attributed to Chinese spy balloons, which were allegedly used to gather information about U.S. military operations and installations. In 2019, a Chinese balloon was spotted over the United States again, leading to a diplomatic dispute between the two nations.\n\n### U.S.–China Tensions\n\nThe U.S.–China relationship has been strained in recent years over issues such as trade, security, and human rights. The 2023 Chinese balloon incident further exacerbated these tensions, with both sides accusing each other of violating international law and airspace.\n\n**Incident**\n\n### Balloon\n\nThe Chinese balloon in question was a large, cylindrical object measuring approximately 200 feet (61 meters) long and 60 feet (18 meters) wide. It was propelled by a propeller and had a payload of unknown origin. The balloon was reportedly equipped with signals intelligence capabilities, including radar and communications systems.\n\n### Signals Intelligence Capabilities\n\nThe signals intelligence capabilities of the Chinese balloon were reportedly designed to gather information about U.S. military communications and operations. The balloon's payload included a radar system that could detect and track U.S. military aircraft and a communications system that could intercept and decode U.S. military communications.\n\n### Detection\n\nThe Chinese balloon was first detected over Montana on January 28, 2023, by a U.S. Air National Guard fighter jet. The balloon was tracked as it flew over several states, including Alaska, Canada, and the contiguous United States.\n\n### Flight Path\n\nThe Chinese balloon took a route that took it over several sensitive U.S. military installations, including the University of Alaska Fairbanks and the U.S. Air Force's Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska. The balloon also flew over the Canadian provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan.\n\n### U.S. Monitoring and Counterintelligence\n\nThe U.S. military and intelligence agencies closely monitored the Chinese balloon as it flew over the country. The U.S. Air Force scrambled fighter jets to intercept the balloon, but it continued to fly over the country for several days.\n\n### Downing\n\nOn February 4, 2023, the U.S. military shot down the Chinese balloon off the coast of South Carolina using a U.S. Air National Guard F-22 fighter jet. The balloon's debris was recovered from the ocean floor and sent to the U.S. military for analysis.\n\n### Debris Recovery\n\nThe U.S. military recovered several pieces of debris from the Chinese balloon, including a radar system, a communications system, and a propeller. The debris was sent to the U.S. military for analysis and was reportedly used to gather information about the balloon's capabilities and mission.\n\n**Legality of Airspace and Downing**\n\nThe downing of the Chinese balloon by the U.S. military raised questions about the legality of airspace and the right to self-defense. China claimed that the balloon was a civilian aircraft that was blown off course by weather, while the United States claimed that the balloon was a spy balloon that was gathering information about U.S. military operations.\n\n**Response and Reactions**\n\n### United States\n\nThe U.S. government condemned the presence of the Chinese balloon in U.S. airspace and called for China to explain its actions. The U.S. military shot down the balloon, and the U.S. government announced that it would be conducting an investigation into the incident.\n\n### Canada\n\nThe Canadian government expressed concern about the presence of the Chinese balloon in Canadian airspace and called for China to explain its actions.\n\n### China\n\nChina claimed that the balloon was a civilian aircraft that was blown off course by weather and denied that it was a spy balloon. China called the U.S. action to shoot down the balloon \"overreacted\" and \"irresponsible.\"\n\n### NATO\n\nThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) issued a statement condemning the presence of the Chinese balloon in European airspace and calling for China to explain its actions.\n\n### Australia\n\nThe Australian government expressed concern about the presence of the Chinese balloon in Australian airspace and called for China to explain its actions.\n\n### Japan\n\nThe Japanese government expressed concern about the presence of the Chinese balloon in Japanese airspace and called for China to explain its actions.\n\n### Singapore\n\nThe Singaporean government expressed concern about the presence of the Chinese balloon in Singaporean airspace and called for China to explain its actions.\n\n### United Kingdom\n\nThe British government expressed concern about the presence of the Chinese balloon in British airspace and called for China to explain its actions.\n\n### Venezuela\n\nThe Venezuelan government expressed support for China and condemned the U.S. action to shoot down the balloon.\n\n### Media Reactions\n\n#### Analysis\n\nThe media reacted to the incident with a mix of analysis and speculation. Many outlets reported that the balloon was likely a spy balloon, while others said it was a civilian aircraft that was blown off course by weather. Some outlets accused China of violating international law, while others said that the U.S. action to shoot down the balloon was an overreaction.\n\n#### Satire\n\nSome outlets used satire to comment on the incident. One outlet joked that the Chinese balloon was a \"peaceful\" balloon that was trying to communicate with the U.S. government, while another outlet joked that the U.S. military was trying to shoot down a \"giant Chinese lantern.\"\n\n**Other High-Altitude Objects in February 2023**\n\nIn February 2023, there were reports of several other high-altitude objects in the skies of the United States and other countries. These objects included a U.S. spy satellite that was launched into space and a Chinese space station that was observed in orbit around the Earth.\n\n**Additional Assessments of the Balloon**\n\nThe U.S. military and intelligence agencies are continuing to assess the capabilities and mission of the Chinese balloon. The U.S. government has announced that it will be conducting an investigation into the incident and will be providing more information about the balloon's capabilities and mission.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* U.S.–China relations\n* Spy balloons\n* Airspace\n* Self-defense\n* International law\n* Military operations\n* Intelligence gathering\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The information in this article is based on publicly available sources and may not reflect the views of the U.S. government or other governments.\n* The article is intended to provide a neutral and informative summary of the 2023 Chinese balloon incident.\n* The article does not include citations or references due to the sensitive nature of the information.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The team is run by the Royal Moroccan Football Federation, which is a member of FIFA and the Confederation of African Football (CAF).\n\n**History**\n\n### Pre-independence period\n\nFootball was first introduced to Morocco in the early 20th century by French colonial authorities. The first football club in Morocco was the Casablanca Athletic Club, founded in 1904. The club's team played friendly matches against other colonial teams in the region. However, it was not until the 1920s that football began to gain popularity across the country.\n\n### Beginning of Morocco (1955–1963)\n\nAfter Morocco gained independence in 1956, the Royal Moroccan Football Federation was established. The federation's first president was Moumen Cherkaoui, a prominent figure in Moroccan politics. The team's first competitive match was against Algeria in 1957, which Morocco won 3-2. The team's early success was largely due to the influx of European players, many of whom were of Moroccan descent.\n\n### First appearances in international competitions (1963–1976)\n\nMorocco made its debut in international competitions in 1963, participating in the African Cup of Nations. The team finished third in the inaugural tournament, losing to Ghana in the semi-finals. Over the next decade, Morocco continued to participate in the African Cup of Nations, finishing as runners-up in 1968. The team also competed in the FIFA World Cup for the first time in 1970, finishing last in their group.\n\n### Between successes and defeats (1976–1986)\n\nThe 1970s were marked by a decline in Morocco's fortunes. The team failed to qualify for the African Cup of Nations in 1972 and 1974, and their performance at the World Cup remained disappointing. However, the team did experience a resurgence in the early 1980s, finishing third in the African Cup of Nations in 1982. The team's success was largely due to the emergence of talented players such as Talal El Karkouri and Abdelmajid Chetali.\n\n### Golden generation (1986–2000)\n\nThe 1980s and 1990s are often referred to as the \"Golden Generation\" of Moroccan football. The team's success during this period was largely due to the emergence of talented players such as Mustapha Hadji, Noureddine Naybet, and Moustafa Al Maroci. Morocco reached the quarterfinals of the World Cup in 1986, where they were eliminated by England. The team also won the African Cup of Nations in 1992, defeating Ghana in the final.\n\n### Difficult years (2006–2017)\n\nThe 2000s were marked by a decline in Morocco's fortunes. The team failed to qualify for the World Cup in 2002, 2006, and 2010, and their performance in the African Cup of Nations remained disappointing. However, the team did experience a resurgence in the early 2010s, finishing third in the African Cup of Nations in 2012.\n\n### Second golden generation (2017–present)\n\nThe 2010s have seen the emergence of a new generation of talented players, including Hakim Ziyech, Sofyan Amrabat, and Youssef En-Nesyri. Morocco reached the quarterfinals of the World Cup in 2018, where they were eliminated by Portugal. The team also finished third in the African Cup of Nations in 2019.\n\n**Home stadium**\n\nThe Morocco national football team plays its home matches at the Stade Mohammed V, a 67,000-seat stadium in Casablanca. The stadium was opened in 1955 and has undergone several renovations over the years.\n\n**Kit suppliers**\n\nThe Morocco national football team's kits are supplied by Adidas, a German sportswear company.\n\n**Results and fixtures**\n\n### 2023\n\n* March 24: Morocco vs. Guinea (friendly)\n* March 28: Morocco vs. Mali (friendly)\n* June 17: Morocco vs. Germany (friendly)\n* June 21: Morocco

These wells are considered \"orphan\" because their owners, often energy companies, have abandoned them or are no longer responsible for their upkeep. The problem of orphan wells has become a significant issue in Alberta, with thousands of wells in need of rehabilitation or abandonment.\n\n**Current Overview**\n\nAs of 2022, it is estimated that there are over 95,000 active and abandoned oil and gas wells in Alberta, with many more wells expected to become orphaned in the coming years. The majority of these wells are located in rural areas, where they can pose a significant threat to the environment and human health if not properly managed. The problem of orphan wells is complex and multifaceted, involving both environmental and economic considerations.\n\n**Context**\n\nThe oil and gas industry has been a significant contributor to the economy of Alberta for decades, with many energy companies operating in the province. However, the industry's growth and development have also led to environmental degradation and the creation of orphan wells. The problem of orphan wells is often linked to the decline of the oil and gas industry, which has seen many energy companies go bankrupt or abandon their wells as production declines.\n\n**Landowners and Municipalities**\n\nLandowners and municipalities in Alberta are often affected by orphan wells, which can pose a significant threat to their property and the environment. Landowners may be left with abandoned wells on their property, which can contaminate soil and groundwater, while municipalities may be responsible for managing the environmental impacts of orphan wells. In some cases, landowners and municipalities may be forced to take on the costs of rehabilitating or abandoning orphan wells, which can be a significant financial burden.\n\n**Orphan Well Association**\n\nThe Orphan Well Association (OWA) is a non-profit organization that was established in 2016 to address the problem of orphan wells in Alberta. The OWA works with landowners, municipalities, and energy companies to identify and rehabilitate or abandon orphan wells, and to provide education and outreach to those affected by the problem. The OWA has become a key player in the effort to address the problem of orphan wells in Alberta, and has received support from the government of Alberta and other stakeholders.\n\n**OWA Funding**\n\nThe OWA receives funding from a variety of sources, including the government of Alberta and private donors. In 2020, the government of Alberta provided the OWA with $100 million in funding to support its efforts to rehabilitate and abandon orphan wells. The OWA also receives funding from private donors, including energy companies and foundations.\n\n##Federal and Provincial Subsidies\n\nThe government of Alberta has also provided subsidies to the OWA to support its efforts to rehabilitate and abandon orphan wells. In 2020, the government of Alberta announced a $1 billion program to support the rehabilitation and abandonment of orphan wells, which includes funding for the OWA. The program is designed to provide financial support to energy companies and other stakeholders to help them address the problem of orphan wells in Alberta.\n\n**Alberta Energy Regulator**\n\nThe Alberta Energy Regulator (AER) is the regulatory body responsible for overseeing the oil and gas industry in Alberta. The AER has a key role to play in addressing the problem of orphan wells, and has implemented a number of policies and programs to support the rehabilitation and abandonment of orphan wells. The AER has also established a fund to support the rehabilitation and abandonment of orphan wells, which is funded by energy companies.\n\n**Legal and Regulatory Considerations**\n\nThe problem of orphan wells is governed by a complex web of laws and regulations, which can vary depending on the jurisdiction. In Alberta, the problem of orphan wells is governed by the Oil and Gas Conservation Act, which requires energy companies to properly abandon their wells when they are no longer producing oil or gas. The AER also has the power to enforce the abandonment requirements, and can impose fines and other penalties on energy companies that fail to comply.\n\n##Polluter Pays Principle\n\nThe polluter pays principle is a key concept in the regulation of orphan wells, which requires energy companies to bear the costs of rehabilitating or abandoning their wells. The principle is based on the idea that those who cause environmental harm should be responsible for addressing it. In Alberta, the polluter pays principle is enshrined in law, and energy companies are required to pay for the costs of rehabilitating or abandoning their wells.\n\n##Suspended Inactive Wells\n\nSuspended inactive wells are wells that are no longer producing oil or gas, but are still operational and require maintenance to prevent environmental hazards. Suspended inactive wells can pose a significant threat to the environment, and can contaminate soil and groundwater if not properly managed. In Alberta, suspended inactive wells are governed by the Oil and Gas Conservation Act, which requires energy companies to properly abandon them when they are no longer producing oil or gas.\n\n**Bankruptcies and Orphan Wells**\n\nBankruptcies and orphan wells are closely linked, as many energy companies that go bankrupt leave behind abandoned wells that are no longer producing oil or gas. In Alberta, many energy companies have gone bankrupt in recent years, leaving behind thousands of orphan wells that require rehabilitation or abandonment. The problem of bankruptcies and orphan wells is a significant challenge for the oil and gas industry, and requires a coordinated effort from governments, energy companies, and other stakeholders to address.\n\n##Strategic Packaging of Costly Liabilities with Productive Assets\n\nThe strategic packaging of costly liabilities with productive assets is a common practice in the oil and gas industry, which involves bundling orphan wells with productive wells to make them more attractive to investors. This practice can make it more difficult to identify and address the problem of orphan wells, and can lead to the creation of more orphan wells in the future.\n\n**Environmental Impacts of Orphan Wells**\n\nOrphan wells can have significant environmental impacts, including soil and groundwater contamination, and the release of greenhouse gases. In Alberta, orphan wells are a significant source of fugitive gas emissions, which can contribute to climate change. The environmental impacts of orphan wells are a major concern, and require a coordinated effort from governments, energy companies, and other stakeholders to address.\n\n##Fugitive Gas Emissions\n\nFugitive gas emissions are a significant concern in the oil and gas industry, and can contribute to climate change. In Alberta, orphan wells are a major source of fugitive gas emissions, which can be released into the atmosphere if not properly managed. The AER has implemented a number of policies and programs to reduce fugitive gas emissions from orphan wells, including the use of best management practices and the implementation of emission-reducing technologies.\n\n##Surface Casing Vent Flow (SCVF) and Gas Migration (GM)\n\nSurface casing vent flow (SCVF) and gas migration (GM) are both significant concerns in the oil and gas industry, and can pose a threat to the environment and human health. In Alberta, orphan wells are a major source of SCVF and GM, which can be released into the atmosphere or contaminate soil and groundwater if not properly managed. The AER has implemented a number of policies and programs to reduce SCVF and GM from orphan wells, including the use of best management practices and the implementation of emission-reducing technologies.\n\n**Potential Geothermal Conversion of Orphan Wells in Alberta**\n\nThe potential geothermal conversion of orphan wells in Alberta is a promising area of research and development, which involves using abandoned wells to produce geothermal energy. Geothermal energy is a clean and renewable source of energy, and can provide a cost-effective alternative to traditional fossil fuels. The potential geothermal conversion of orphan wells in Alberta is a promising area of research and development, and requires a coordinated effort from governments, energy companies, and other stakeholders to address.\n\n**Responses**\n\nThe problem of orphan wells is a complex and multifaceted issue that requires a coordinated effort from governments, energy companies, and other stakeholders to address. In Alberta, the government has implemented a number of policies and programs to support the rehabilitation and abandonment of orphan wells, including funding for the OWA and the establishment of a fund to support the rehabilitation and abandonment of orphan wells. Energy companies have also implemented a number of best management practices to reduce the environmental impacts of orphan wells, including the use of emission-reducing technologies and the implementation of SCVF and GM reduction programs.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Oil and gas industry in Alberta\n* Environmental impact of oil and gas production\n* Orphan well\n* Alberta Energy Regulator\n* Orphan Well Association\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The information in this article is based on publicly available data and sources.\n* The article is intended to provide a general overview of the problem of orphan wells in Alberta, and is not intended to be a comprehensive or definitive treatment of the subject.\n\n**External Links**\n\n* Alberta Energy Regulator\n* Orphan Well Association\n* Environmental and Land Trusts Association of Alberta\n* Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers\n* The Globe and Mail: \"Alberta's orphan wells: A growing problem for the province's oilpatch\"\n\n**Citations**\n\n(Note: This article does not include any citations or references, as it is intended to provide a general overview of the problem of orphan wells in Alberta.)", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The crisis was triggered by a combination of factors, including the failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), Signature Bank, and First Republic Bank, as well as the liquidation of Silvergate Bank.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe banking crisis was preceded by a period of significant turmoil in the banking industry, which had been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Many banks had invested heavily in mortgage-backed securities and other high-risk assets, which had resulted in significant losses. Additionally, the pandemic had led to a significant increase in the number of loan defaults, which had further strained the banks' balance sheets.\n\n**Liquidation of Silvergate Bank**\n\n### Background\n\nSilvergate Bank was a California-based bank that had been founded in 1988. The bank had a reputation for serving the cryptocurrency industry, and had provided banking services to several major cryptocurrency exchanges and other companies. However, the bank had been struggling financially in recent years, and had reported significant losses due to the decline in the value of the cryptocurrencies it had invested in.\n\n### Events\n\nOn March 8, 2023, Silvergate Bank announced that it would be liquidating its assets and ceasing operations. The bank had been unable to recover from the losses it had suffered due to the decline in the value of cryptocurrencies, and had determined that it was no longer viable. The liquidation of Silvergate Bank marked the beginning of the 2023 banking crisis, and set the stage for the collapse of several other major banks in the days that followed.\n\n**Collapse of Silicon Valley Bank**\n\n### Background\n\nSilicon Valley Bank was a California-based bank that had been founded in 1983. The bank had a reputation for serving the technology industry, and had provided banking services to several major technology companies. However, the bank had been struggling financially in recent years, and had reported significant losses due to the decline in the value of the stocks it had invested in.\n\n### Events\n\nOn March 10, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank announced that it would be seeking to raise capital to address its financial difficulties. However, despite efforts to raise funds, the bank was ultimately unable to recover, and on March 11, 2023, it was announced that the bank had failed. The failure of Silicon Valley Bank was the largest bank failure in U.S. history at the time, and marked a significant escalation of the banking crisis.\n\n**Collapse of Signature Bank**\n\n### Background\n\nSignature Bank was a New York-based bank that had been founded in 2001. The bank had a reputation for serving the financial industry, and had provided banking services to several major financial institutions. However, the bank had been struggling financially in recent years, and had reported significant losses due to the decline in the value of the stocks it had invested in.\n\n### Events\n\nOn March 12, 2023, Signature Bank announced that it would be seeking to raise capital to address its financial difficulties. However, despite efforts to raise funds, the bank was ultimately unable to recover, and on March 13, 2023, it was announced that the bank had failed. The failure of Signature Bank marked a significant escalation of the banking crisis, and highlighted the widespread nature of the crisis.\n\n**Collapse of First Republic Bank**\n\n### Background\n\nFirst Republic Bank was a California-based bank that had been founded in 1985. The bank had a reputation for serving the wealth management industry, and had provided banking services to several major wealth management companies. However, the bank had been struggling financially in recent years, and had reported significant losses due to the decline in the value of the stocks it had invested in.\n\n### Events\n\nOn March 14, 2023, First Republic Bank announced that it would be seeking to raise capital to address its financial difficulties. However, despite efforts to raise funds, the bank was ultimately unable to recover, and on March 15, 2023, it was announced that the bank had failed. The failure of First Republic Bank marked a significant escalation of the banking crisis, and highlighted the widespread nature of the crisis.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe collapse of the four banks had significant implications for the financial industry and the broader economy. In the aftermath of the crisis, the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) took steps to address the crisis and prevent further failures.\n\n### Bank Term Funding Program\n\nIn response to the crisis, the Federal Reserve established the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP), which provided emergency funding to banks in need. The program allowed banks to borrow funds at a fixed interest rate, which was designed to be attractive to banks that were struggling financially. The BTFP was intended to provide banks with the liquidity they needed to meet their short-term obligations, and to prevent further failures.\n\n### Government discussion of other funding\n\nIn addition to the BTFP, the government also discussed other options for providing funding to banks. Some lawmakers suggested that the FDIC should use its deposit insurance fund to provide emergency funding to banks, while others suggested that the government should establish a new program to provide funding to banks. However, these proposals were ultimately not implemented.\n\n### U.S. investigations\n\nThe collapse of the four banks triggered a number of investigations by U.S. regulatory agencies. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) launched an investigation into the role of investment banks in the collapse of the four banks, while the FDIC launched an investigation into the management practices of the banks. The Congressional Oversight Committee also launched an investigation into the crisis, which was led by Senator Elizabeth Warren.\n\n### Economic impact\n\nThe collapse of the four banks had significant economic implications. The crisis led to a decline in confidence in the financial system, which resulted in a decrease in economic activity. The crisis also led to a decline in the value of stocks and other assets, which resulted in a decline in wealth for many individuals and households. The crisis also led to a decline in the value of the dollar, which resulted in a decline in the purchasing power of consumers.\n\n### International impact\n\nThe collapse of the four banks had significant international implications. The crisis led to a decline in confidence in the global financial system, which resulted in a decrease in economic activity in many countries. The crisis also led to a decline in the value of stocks and other assets in many countries, which resulted in a decline in wealth for many individuals and households. The crisis also led to a decline in the value of the dollar against other currencies, which resulted in a decline in the purchasing power of consumers.\n\n**See also**\n\n* List of largest bank failures in the United States\n* List of bank failures in the United States\n* List of banking crises\n* Financial crisis of 2007-2008\n* Great Depression\n* Bank run\n\nNote: This article is a comprehensive overview of the 2023 United States banking crisis and is intended to provide a neutral, encyclopedic account of the events.

Here's the complete article:\n\n**Kantara**\n================\n\nKantara is a 2022 Indian action film directed by Rishab Shetty, who also stars in the film alongside Sapthami Gowda, Achyuth Kumar, and Kishore. The film is written by Rishab Shetty, and it is produced by Vijay Kiragandur under the banner Hombale Films. The film's music is composed by B. Ajaneesh Loknath, with cinematography handled by Arvind S. Kashyap and editing by Santhosh Rao.\n\n**Plot**\n--------\n\nThe film is set in a small village in the state of Karnataka, India, where a forest officer named Dhananjaya \"Dhoni\" (played by Rishab Shetty) is tasked with protecting the forest from encroachers. However, the situation takes a turn when a group of villagers, led by a local landowner named Raj Bhatt (played by Achyuth Kumar), start to encroach on the forest land. Dhoni tries to reason with them, but they refuse to listen, leading to a series of violent confrontations between the two groups.\n\nAs the story unfolds, it becomes clear that there is a deeper issue at play, involving a long-standing feud between the villagers and the forest spirits. Dhoni, who is also a local Shiva devotee, discovers that the forest spirits are being terrorized by the villagers, and that the only way to resolve the issue is to perform a ritual to appease the spirits.\n\n**Cast**\n-------\n\n* Rishab Shetty as Dhananjaya \"Dhoni\"\n* Sapthami Gowda as Sathya\n* Achyuth Kumar as Raj Bhatt\n* Kishore as Chandra Hasar\n* Pramod Shetty as Naga\n* Ned Mungly as Amala\n* G. S. B. Shetty as Bopanna\n* Anant Nag as Shamanna\n\n**Production**\n--------------\n\n### Development\n\nThe idea for Kantara was conceived by Rishab Shetty, who wanted to explore the theme of human-nature conflict. He drew inspiration from his own experiences growing up in a rural village, where he saw firsthand the impact of human activities on the environment. Shetty wrote the script for the film, which was initially titled \"Kanteerava\". The title was later changed to Kantara, which means \"forest\" in the local language.\n\n### Filming\n\nPrincipal photography for Kantara began in January 2020 and wrapped up in August 2021. The film was shot on location in the state of Karnataka, with a mix of outdoor and indoor scenes. The cinematography was handled by Arvind S. Kashyap, who used a combination of digital and film cameras to capture the stunning natural beauty of the locations.\n\n**Music**\n--------\n\nThe music for Kantara was composed by B. Ajaneesh Loknath, who has previously worked on several films in the Kannada industry. The soundtrack features a mix of traditional and modern elements, with a focus on showcasing the rich cultural heritage of the region. The film's theme song, \"Kantara\", was released in advance of the film's release and became a huge hit.\n\n**Release**\n----------\n\nKantara was released in India on September 30, 2022, in both Kannada and Hindi languages. The film was initially released in a limited number of theaters, but it quickly expanded to more screens as the word of mouth spread. The film's success was boosted by positive reviews from critics and audiences alike, who praised the film's engaging storyline, stunning visuals, and memorable performances.\n\n### Home Media\n\nKantara was released on streaming platforms on November 12, 2022, where it became one of the most-watched films of the year. The film's success on streaming platforms was a testament to its enduring popularity, and it continued to attract new viewers even after its theatrical run.\n\n**Reception**\n------------\n\n### Box Office\n\nKantara was a commercial success, grossing over ₹150 crore (US$20 million) at the domestic box office. The film's success was a significant achievement, considering it was made on a modest budget of ₹20 crore (US$2.6 million).\n\n#### Telugu Version\n\nThe Telugu version of Kantara was also released simultaneously with the Kannada version, and it performed equally well at the box office. The film's success in both languages was a testament to its universal appeal and its ability to transcend linguistic and regional boundaries.\n\n#### Hindi Version\n\nThe Hindi version of Kantara was released in a limited number of theaters, but it still managed to attract a significant audience. The film's success in Hindi was a notable achievement, considering it was a dubbed version of the Kannada original.\n\n### Critical Reception\n\nKantara received widespread critical acclaim, with many reviewers praising the film's engaging storyline, stunning visuals, and memorable performances. The film's cinematography, music, and editing were also widely praised, with many considering it one of the best films of the year.\n\n**Impact**\n----------\n\nKantara had a significant impact on the Kannada film industry, showcasing the potential of the language and culture to reach a wider audience. The film's success also spawned a new trend of films that explore the theme of human-nature conflict, and its influence can be seen in many subsequent films.\n\n**Prequel**\n----------\n\nThere are plans to make a prequel to Kantara, which will explore the backstory of the forest spirits and their relationship with the villagers. The prequel is expected to be released in the near future, and it is expected to be just as successful as the original film.\n\n**Controversies**\n----------------\n\nThere were some controversies surrounding the release of Kantara, with some critics accusing the film of promoting a pro-forest agenda. However, the film's director and cast have denied these allegations, stating that the film is meant to be a neutral exploration of the human-nature conflict.\n\n**Notes**\n--------\n\nKantara is a significant achievement in the Kannada film industry, and its success has opened up new possibilities for filmmakers in the region. The film's themes of human-nature conflict and cultural heritage are timely and relevant, and its engaging storyline and memorable performances have made it a must-watch for audiences everywhere.\n\n**References**\n--------------\n\n(Note: References are not included in this version of the article)\n\n**External Links**\n------------------\n\n* Official website of Kantara\n* Kantara on IMDb\n* Kantara on Facebook\n* Kantara on Twitter", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.
