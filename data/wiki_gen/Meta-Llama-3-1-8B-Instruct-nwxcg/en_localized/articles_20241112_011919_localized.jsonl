The shortage was caused by a combination of factors, including supply chain issues, recall and plant shutdown, import restrictions, and market concentration.\n\nCauses\n\nSupply chain issues were a major contributor to the infant formula shortage. The global supply chain was already strained due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the shortage was exacerbated by a series of natural disasters, including a tornado that hit a major manufacturing plant in Indiana. The plant, owned by Abbott Nutrition, was forced to shut down, further reducing the already limited supply of infant formula.\n\n### Recall and plant shutdown\n\nIn February 2022, Abbott Nutrition issued a voluntary recall of several of its infant formula products due to contamination concerns. The recall was triggered by reports of Cronobacter sakazakii, a bacterium that can cause serious infections in infants. The recall affected over 30 products, including Similac, Alimentum, and EleCare.\n\n#### Alleged problems at Sturgis plant\n\nInvestigations into the cause of the contamination revealed alleged problems at Abbott's Sturgis plant in Michigan. Inspectors found evidence of unsanitary conditions, including the presence of insects and rodent droppings. The findings raised concerns about the company's manufacturing practices and the safety of its products.\n\nImport restrictions also played a role in the shortage. The United States imposed tariffs on imported infant formula in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which made it more expensive for companies to import formula from other countries. The tariffs, combined with the recall and plant shutdown, reduced the supply of infant formula available in the United States.\n\nMarket concentration was another factor that contributed to the shortage. The infant formula market is dominated by a few large companies, including Abbott, Nestle, and Reckitt Benckiser. The concentration of market power in the hands of a few companies made it difficult for new entrants to enter the market and increase supply.\n\nEffects\n\nThe infant formula shortage had significant effects on families across the United States. Many parents were forced to seek out alternative sources of nutrition for their infants, including breast milk and other types of formula.\n\n### Sale and donation of breast milk\n\nBreastfeeding advocates saw the shortage as an opportunity to promote breastfeeding as a sustainable and healthy alternative to formula. Many mothers took to social media to encourage others to breastfeed and donate their excess milk to those in need. Several online platforms and apps were created to connect mothers who wanted to donate their milk with families in need.\n\n### Use of alternative foods\n\nFamilies who were unable to access infant formula were forced to seek out alternative sources of nutrition for their infants. This included using other types of formula, such as soy-based or rice-based formula, and even homemade alternatives made from ingredients like oats and bananas.\n\n### Hospitalizations\n\nThe shortage also led to an increase in hospitalizations for infants who were malnourished due to a lack of access to formula. In some cases, infants were forced to stay in the hospital for extended periods of time while their parents sought out alternative sources of nutrition.\n\n### Bot usage\n\nThe shortage also led to an increase in bot usage on social media platforms. Many parents turned to online communities and forums to connect with others who were facing similar challenges and to seek advice on how to navigate the shortage.\n\n### Shortage in Canada\n\nThe infant formula shortage also affected Canada, where several major brands were out of stock. The shortage was attributed to a combination of factors, including supply chain issues and import restrictions.\n\nResponses\n\nIn response to the shortage, several efforts were made to prevent price gouging and increase supply.\n\n### Efforts to prevent price gouging\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) launched an investigation into price gouging by companies that were taking advantage of the shortage to increase prices. The FTC also issued guidance to companies on how to prevent price gouging and ensure that they were complying with federal regulations.\n\n### Efforts to increase supply\n\nSeveral companies, including Abbott and Nestle, increased production to meet the demand for infant formula. The companies also implemented measures to improve supply chain efficiency and reduce the risk of contamination.\n\n### Efforts to restore production\n\nAbbott Nutrition worked to restore production at its Sturgis plant, which was shut down due to contamination concerns. The company implemented new measures to improve sanitation and safety at the plant and to prevent future contamination.\n\n### Investigations\n\nSeveral investigations were launched to determine the cause of the contamination and to identify those responsible.\n\n#### Congressional investigation\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives launched an investigation into the infant formula shortage and the role of Abbott Nutrition in the crisis. The investigation focused on the company's manufacturing practices, its handling of the recall, and its communication with federal regulators.\n\n#### FDA investigation\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) launched an investigation into the cause of the contamination and to identify those responsible. The investigation focused on the company's manufacturing practices and its compliance with federal regulations.\n\n#### ABC News investigation\n\nABC News conducted an investigation into the infant formula shortage and the role of Abbott Nutrition in the crisis. The investigation revealed allegations of unsanitary conditions at the company's Sturgis plant and raised concerns about the safety of its products.\n\n#### DOJ investigation\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) launched an investigation into price gouging by companies that were taking advantage of the shortage to increase prices. The investigation focused on companies that were selling infant formula at inflated prices and on those that were engaged in other forms of price gouging.\n\nCommentary\n\nThe infant formula shortage sparked a debate about the merits of breastfeeding versus formula feeding.\n\n### Breast milk vs. formula debate\n\nBreastfeeding advocates saw the shortage as an opportunity to promote breastfeeding as a sustainable and healthy alternative to formula. Many mothers took to social media to encourage others to breastfeed and donate their excess milk to those in need. Several online platforms and apps were created to connect mothers who wanted to donate their milk with families in need.\n\n### Criticism of federal response\n\nSeveral critics argued that the federal response to the shortage was inadequate. They pointed to the slow pace of the recall, the failure to increase supply, and the lack of communication with families affected by the shortage.\n\n#### White House response\n\nThe White House responded to criticism of the federal response by stating that the administration was working to address the shortage and to prevent future contamination. The White House also emphasized the importance of breastfeeding and the need for families to have access to safe and affordable infant formula.\n\n#### Formula availability at the Southern border\n\nThe infant formula shortage also raised concerns about the availability of formula at the Southern border. Several news outlets reported that families who were seeking asylum in the United States were struggling to access formula for their infants. The shortage highlighted the need for improved support for families who are seeking asylum and for increased access to essential goods and services.\n\nSee also\n\n* Infant formula shortage in Canada\n* Recall of infant formula products\n* Cronobacter sakazakii outbreak\n* Abbott Nutrition\n* Nestle\n* Reckitt Benckiser\n* Federal Trade Commission\n* U.S. Food and Drug Administration\n* U.S. Department of Justice\n* Breastfeeding advocacy\n* Infant formula safety\n* Supply chain management\n* Market concentration\n* Price gouging\n* Regulatory compliance", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The crisis has its roots in a military coup that overthrew the democratically elected government of President Mohamed Bazoum, and has since evolved into a broader conflict involving regional and international actors.\n\n# Background\n\n## ECOWAS\n\nThe Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) is a regional organization that aims to promote economic integration and cooperation among its 15 member states, including Niger. ECOWAS has a long history of involvement in conflict resolution and peacekeeping in the region, and has played a key role in mediating the crisis in Niger.\n\n## Security situation\n\nNiger is a fragile state with a history of insecurity and instability. The country has been plagued by terrorist attacks, banditry, and ethnic violence, particularly in the north and west. The security situation has been exacerbated by the presence of extremist groups, such as Boko Haram and the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS), which have been operating in the region.\n\n# Timeline\n\n## July\n\n### 29 July\n\nThe crisis began on 29 July 2023, when a group of soldiers led by General Abdourahamane Tchiani seized power in a military coup, overthrowing the democratically elected government of President Mohamed Bazoum. The coup was widely condemned by the international community, including ECOWAS, the African Union, and the United Nations.\n\n### 30 July\n\n#### ECOWAS ultimatum and sanctions\n\nECOWAS issued an ultimatum to the military junta, demanding the restoration of the democratically elected government and the release of President Bazoum. ECOWAS also imposed economic sanctions on Niger, including a ban on trade and travel with the country.\n\n#### Pro-coup demonstrations in Niamey\n\nPro-coup demonstrations were held in Niamey, the capital city of Niger, in support of the military junta. The demonstrations were seen as a challenge to ECOWAS's authority and a sign of the fragility of the security situation in Niger.\n\n### 31 July\n\nECOWAS leaders met in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, to discuss the crisis in Niger. The leaders agreed to maintain pressure on the military junta and to explore options for restoring democracy in Niger.\n\n## August\n\n### 1 August\n\nECOWAS leaders met with the military junta in

Born in the United States, Young's swimming career spanned over two decades, with notable achievements in various long-distance swim competitions. This article provides an overview of Young's early swimming achievements, his Catalina channel swim, inconsistent swimming career, late swim career, swim retirement and marriage, late professional life, honors, and relevant references.\n\n**Early swimming achievements**\n\nYoung's interest in swimming began at a young age, and he quickly developed a passion for the sport. His early swimming achievements were marked by a series of successful swims in various competitions. One of the notable aspects of Young's early swimming career was his training in Catalina.\n\n**Catalina swim training**\n\nYoung began his swimming career in Catalina, a popular destination for swimmers due to its calm and clear waters. The island's unique geography, with its surrounding channel and ocean currents, provided a challenging yet rewarding environment for Young to hone his swimming skills. Under the guidance of experienced coaches and mentors, Young refined his technique and built his endurance, laying the foundation for his future success.\n\nYoung's training in Catalina was not without its challenges. The swimmer faced strong ocean currents, rip tides, and unpredictable weather conditions, which forced him to adapt and develop strategies to overcome these obstacles. Despite these challenges, Young's dedication and perseverance paid off, as he made significant progress in his swimming career.\n\n**Catalina channel swim**\n\nOne of Young's most notable achievements was his Catalina channel swim, which he completed in a remarkable display of endurance and skill. The swim, which took place in a specific channel off the coast of Catalina, was a grueling test of Young's physical and mental limits. The swimmer faced treacherous currents, strong winds, and unpredictable sea conditions, which threatened to derail his efforts at various points during the swim.\n\nDespite these challenges, Young persevered, drawing on his extensive training and experience to navigate the channel and complete the swim. His achievement in the Catalina channel swim marked a significant milestone in his career, demonstrating his capabilities as a long-distance swimmer.\n\n**Swam with tides**\n\nYoung's Catalina channel swim was notable not only for its duration but also for its unique circumstances. The swimmer chose to swim with the tides, which added an extra level of complexity to the challenge. By swimming with the tides, Young had to contend with strong currents that flowed in both directions, making it difficult to maintain a consistent pace.\n\nYoung's decision to swim with the tides was a deliberate choice, as he sought to test his endurance and adaptability in a dynamic environment. The swimmer's ability to adjust to the changing currents and maintain a steady pace was a testament to his skill and experience as a long-distance swimmer.\n\n**Competition from Norman Ross**\n\nYoung's Catalina channel swim was not without competition from other notable swimmers, including Norman Ross. Ross, a fellow American swimmer, was also training in Catalina and was considered a rival by Young. The two swimmers engaged in a series of intense swims, with each attempting to outdo the other in terms of distance and speed.\n\nYoung's rivalry with Ross pushed him to new heights, as he sought to stay ahead of his competitor and prove himself as a top-tier swimmer. The competition between the two swimmers added an extra level of excitement and tension to their swims, as they vied for recognition and accolades in the sport.\n\n**Public acclaim, with limited financial gain**\n\nYoung's achievements in the Catalina channel swim and other competitions brought him significant public acclaim, with many recognizing his exceptional skills and dedication to the sport. However, despite his success, Young faced limited financial gain from his swimming career. The sport was not as lucrative as other professional pursuits, and Young often struggled to make a living from his swimming endeavors.\n\nYoung's limited financial gain did not deter him from pursuing his passion for swimming. Instead, he continued to swim with the same dedication and enthusiasm, driven by a desire to push himself to new heights and make a name for himself in the sport. His perseverance and commitment to swimming earned him the respect and admiration of his peers and fans.\n\n**Inconsistent swimming career**\n\nYoung's swimming career was marked by periods of intense activity followed by periods of inactivity. The swimmer's inconsistent schedule and performance made it challenging for him to achieve a consistent level of success in the sport. Despite his best efforts, Young struggled to maintain a high level of performance, which affected his overall career trajectory.\n\n**1927, 21-Mile Lake Ontario swim**\n\nOne of Young's notable swims took place in 1927, when he completed a 21-mile swim in Lake Ontario. The swim was a significant achievement for Young, as it demonstrated his ability to complete long-distance swims in challenging conditions. However, the swim was not without its challenges, as Young faced strong currents and unpredictable weather conditions.\n\n**1928, 15-Mile Lake Ontario swim**\n\nIn 1928, Young completed a 15-mile swim in Lake Ontario, which was a notable achievement for the swimmer. The swim demonstrated Young's ability to adapt to changing conditions and maintain a consistent pace over a long distance. However, the swim was not without its challenges, as Young faced strong currents and unpredictable weather conditions.\n\n**Wins Sept 1928 Montreal to Repentigney Marathon**\n\nYoung's swim in September 1928, which took place in the Montreal to Repentigney Marathon, was a significant achievement for the swimmer. The swim was a grueling test of Young's endurance and skill, as he faced strong currents and unpredictable weather conditions. Young's victory in the marathon marked a significant milestone in his career, demonstrating his capabilities as a long-distance swimmer.\n\n**1929, 15-mile Lake Ontario swim**\n\nIn 1929, Young completed a 15-mile swim in Lake Ontario, which was a notable achievement for the swimmer. The swim demonstrated Young's ability to adapt to changing conditions and maintain a consistent pace over a long distance. However, the swim was not without its challenges, as Young faced strong currents and unpredictable weather conditions.\n\n**1930, 15-mile Lake Ontario swim**\n\nIn 1930, Young completed a 15-mile swim in Lake Ontario, which was a significant achievement for the swimmer. The swim demonstrated Young's ability to complete long-distance swims in challenging conditions. However, the swim was not without its challenges, as Young faced strong currents and unpredictable weather conditions.\n\n**Wins 1931 Lake Ontario win**\n\nYoung's win in the 1931 Lake Ontario swim was a significant achievement for the swimmer. The swim was a grueling test of Young's endurance and skill, as he faced strong currents and unpredictable weather conditions. Young's victory in the swim marked a significant milestone in his career, demonstrating his capabilities as a long-distance swimmer.\n\n**Late swim career**\n\nYoung's swimming career continued in the late 1930s, with the swimmer competing in various long-distance swim competitions. However, Young's performance began to decline, and he struggled to maintain a high level of success in the sport. Despite this, Young continued to swim with the same dedication and enthusiasm, driven by a desire to push himself to new heights and make a name for himself in the sport.\n\n**Swim retirement and marriage**\n\nYoung retired from professional swimming in the late 1930s, following a successful career that spanned over two decades. During this time, Young also got married and started a family. The swimmer's decision to retire from professional swimming marked the end of an era, as he transitioned from a life of intense competition and training to a more relaxed and private existence.\n\n**Marriages**\n\nYoung was married twice, with both marriages ending in divorce. The first marriage took place in the early 1920s, and the second marriage occurred in the late 1920s. Young's marital history was marked by periods of separation and divorce, which affected his personal and professional life.\n\n**Late professional life**\n\nAfter retiring from professional swimming, Young went on to pursue other interests and ventures. However, the swimmer's late professional life was marked by a decline in his overall health and well-being. Young's health problems affected his ability to engage in physical activity, including swimming, which was a significant blow to his mental and emotional well-being.\n\n**Honors**\n\nYoung's achievements in the sport of swimming earned him significant recognition and accolades. The swimmer was awarded various honors and awards for his outstanding performances, including:\n\n* Member of the United States Swimming Hall of Fame\n* Inducted into the Lake Ontario Swimming Hall of Fame\n* Recipient of the Golden Goggles Award\n\nYoung's honors and awards served as a testament to his dedication and perseverance in the sport, as well as his exceptional skills and abilities as a long-distance swimmer.\n\n**See also**\n\n* List of notable long-distance swimmers\n* History of swimming\n* Swimming in the United States\n\n**References**\n\n* \n*", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The CRFL is a community-based league, with a strong focus on grassroots football and the development of young players.\n\n**#History**\n\nThe Central Riverina Football League was formed in 1922, when a group of football clubs from the Riverina region decided to come together and create a new competition.

Developed by Fred Wolf, the series was produced by Fred Wolf Films and was based on the comic book series of the same name created by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird.\n\n**Series overview**\n\nThe TMNT follows the adventures of four anthropomorphic turtles, Leonardo, Michelangelo, Donatello, and Raphael, who are trained in the art of ninjutsu by a wise rat named Splinter. The series takes place in New York City, where the turtles fight against evil forces, including the villainous Shredder and his Foot Clan.\n\n**Seasons 1–7**\n\nThe first seven seasons of the TMNT series were produced from 1987 to 1996. During this period, the series underwent a significant change in animation style, from a more traditional 2D animation to a more modern, computer-generated animation.\n\n### Vacation in Europe\n\nIn the fourth season, the TMNT embarked on a vacation to Europe, where they encountered various historical and cultural landmarks. This storyline was notable for its unique blend of action, comedy, and educational content.\n\n**Seasons 8–10**\n\nThe final three seasons of the TMNT series were produced from 1997 to 1998. During this period, the series underwent a significant change in tone, shifting from a more lighthearted, comedic approach to a more serious, dramatic one. This change was largely driven by the retirement of the original voice actors and the introduction of new characters.\n\n**Subsequent works**\n\nThe TMNT series has spawned numerous spin-offs, including animated television series, films, and video games. These works have continued to build upon the original series, introducing new characters and storylines while maintaining the core spirit of the franchise.\n\n**Characters**\n\nThe TMNT series features a diverse cast of characters, each with their own unique personalities and traits.\n\n### Overview\n\nThe main characters of the TMNT series are the four anthropomorphic turtles, Leonardo, Michelangelo, Donatello, and Raphael, who are trained in the art of ninjutsu by a wise rat named Splinter. Each turtle has their own distinct personality and skills, which are often used to solve problems and defeat villains.\n\n### Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\n\nThe four main turtles are:\n\n* **Leonardo**: The leader of the group, Leonardo is known for his strategic thinking and leadership skills. He wears a blue mask and wields twin katanas.\n* **Michelangelo**: The youngest and most carefree of the group, Michelangelo is known for his love of pizza and his skill with a pair of nunchucks.

These acts were enacted to maintain discipline and order within the military, and they played a significant role in shaping the history of British naval and military policies.\n\nBackground\n----------\n\nThe concept of mutiny, or rebellion against superior officers, has been a persistent concern for military leaders throughout history. In the British armed forces, mutinies were often sparked by poor living conditions, inadequate pay, and harsh discipline. To address these issues, the British government enacted a series of laws, known as the Mutiny Acts, which were designed to prevent mutinies and maintain order within the military.\n\nPassage of the first Mutiny Act\n------------------------------\n\nThe first Mutiny Act was passed in 1689, during the reign of King William III. This act established the framework for martial law in the British armed forces and provided for the prosecution of mutinous behavior. The act made it a capital offense for a soldier to refuse to obey orders, and it granted the power to courts-martial to try and punish mutineers.\n\nRenewal of the Mutiny Acts\n-------------------------\n\nOver the years, the Mutiny Acts were renewed and revised several times. In 1702, during the War of the Spanish Succession, the Mutiny Act was renewed and expanded to include provisions for the trial of mutineers by court-martial. In 1751, the Mutiny Act was again renewed, and it introduced the concept of \"desertion,\" which made it a crime for a soldier to leave their post without permission.\n\nThe Quartering Acts\n-------------------\n\nIn addition to the Mutiny Acts, the British government also passed a series of Quartering Acts, which provided for the housing and quartering of soldiers in the field. These acts were necessary because the British army was often far from home, and soldiers needed a place to live and rest. The Quartering Acts allowed the government to requisition buildings and land for military use, and they provided for the payment of rent and other expenses.\n\nList\n-----\n\n### England\n\n* 1689: The first Mutiny Act is passed.\n* 1702: The Mutiny Act is renewed and expanded.\n* 1751: The Mutiny Act is again renewed, and it introduces the concept of \"desertion.\"\n\n### Great Britain\n\n* 1704: The Mutiny Act is renewed, and it includes provisions for the trial of mutineers by court-martial.\n* 1757: The Mutiny Act is renewed, and it establishes the framework for the trial of mutineers by court-martial.\n\n### United Kingdom\n\n#### 1800s\n\n* 1803: The Mutiny Act is renewed, and it includes provisions for the trial of mutineers by court-martial.\n* 1813: The Mutiny Act is renewed, and it establishes the framework for the trial of mutineers by court-martial.\n\n#### 1810s\n\n* 1815: The Mutiny Act is renewed, and it includes provisions for the trial of mutineers by court-martial.\n* 1818: The Mutiny Act is renewed, and it establishes the framework for the trial of mutineers by court-martial.\n\n#### 1820s\n\n* 1823: The Mutiny Act is renewed, and it includes provisions for the trial of mutineers by court-martial.\n* 1826: The Mutiny Act is renewed, and it establishes the framework for the trial of mutineers by court-martial.\n\n#### 1830s\n\n* 1832: The Mutiny Act is renewed, and it includes provisions for the trial of mutineers by court-martial.\n* 1835: The Mutiny Act is renewed, and it establishes the framework for the trial of mutineers by court-martial.\n\n#### 1840s\n\n* 1842: The Mutiny Act is renewed, and it includes provisions for the trial of mutineers by court-martial.\n* 1845: The Mutiny Act is renewed, and it establishes the framework for the trial of mutineers by court-martial.\n\n#### 1850s\n\n* 1852: The Mutiny Act is renewed, and it includes provisions for the trial of mutineers by court-martial.\n* 1855: The Mutiny Act is renewed, and it establishes the framework for the trial of mutineers by court-martial.\n\n#### 1860s\n\n* 1863: The Mutiny Act is renewed, and it includes provisions for the trial of mutineers by court-martial.\n* 1866: The Mutiny Act is renewed, and it establishes the framework for the trial of mutineers by court-martial.\n\n#### 1870s\n\n* 1871: The Mutiny Act is renewed, and it includes provisions for the trial of mutineers by court-martial.\n* 1874: The Mutiny Act is renewed, and it establishes the framework for the trial of mutineers by court-martial.\n\nMarine Mutiny Acts\n------------------\n\nIn addition to the general Mutiny Acts, the British government also passed a series of Marine Mutiny Acts, which were specific to the Royal Navy. These acts were designed to prevent mutinies on board naval vessels and to maintain discipline among sailors. The Marine Mutiny Acts were similar to the general Mutiny Acts, but they included additional provisions related to the unique circumstances of naval service.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Mutiny\n* Royal Navy\n* British Army\n* Martial law\n* Courts-martial\n* Quartering Acts\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n(Note: This article does not include any citations or references.)", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The incident sparked widespread controversy and debate, with many criticizing Smith's actions as unacceptable and others defending him as a victim of a perceived slight.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Academy Awards, popularly known as the Oscars, is an annual ceremony that recognizes excellence in cinematic achievements. The ceremony is typically a formal and dignified event, with a live broadcast on television attracting a large audience worldwide. Chris Rock, a renowned comedian and actor, was the host of the 94th Academy Awards ceremony, his second time hosting the event.\n\nWill Smith, a well-established actor, was nominated for Best Actor for his role in the film \"King Richard.\" Jada Pinkett Smith, his wife, was also a well-known actress and a prominent figure in the entertainment industry. Jada has been open about her struggles with alopecia, a condition that causes hair loss.\n\n**Incident**\n\nDuring the ceremony, Chris Rock took the stage to introduce the next award, the Best Documentary Feature. As he was presenting the award, Rock made a joke about Jada Pinkett Smith, saying, \"Jada, I love ya. G.I. Jane 2, can't wait to see it.\" The joke was a reference to Jada's shaved head, which is a result of her alopecia. Will Smith, who was sitting in the audience with his wife, stood up and walked on stage, slapping Chris Rock in the face.\n\n**Photograph**\n\nThe incident was captured on live television and was widely shared on social media.

These videos were widely shared and helped to fuel the controversy surrounding the incident.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\n**Initial response**\n\nThe initial response to the incident was one of shock and outrage. Many people condemned Will Smith's actions as unacceptable and violent, while others defended him as a victim of a perceived slight. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which presents the Oscars, issued a statement saying that Will Smith had been asked to leave the ceremony but refused.\n\n**Public apologies**\n\nWill Smith later apologized for his actions, saying that he had been \"out of line\" and that he loved his wife. Chris Rock also apologized for his joke, saying that it was not intended to be hurtful. The incident sparked a wider conversation about the limits of free speech and the importance of respecting others' boundaries.\n\n**Formal Academy review**\n\nThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences launched a formal review of the incident, which included a review of the circumstances surrounding the incident and an investigation into whether Will Smith's behavior was a breach of the Academy's rules. The review was led by a committee of Academy members and included input from various stakeholders, including Chris Rock and Will Smith.\n\n**Resignation and ban**\n\nThe review found that Will Smith had breached the Academy's rules and recommended that he be banned from the ceremony for a period of 10 years.

The case began with allegations of voter suppression, intimidation, and election tampering, and eventually led to the indictment and prosecution of several individuals.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Prior to and during election day\n\nIn the months leading up to the 2020 presidential election, several individuals and organizations in Georgia began to make efforts to influence the outcome of the election. These efforts included attempts to suppress voter turnout in predominantly Democratic areas and to promote misinformation about the election process.\n\n### Efforts to pressure Georgia state officials\n\nOne of the key figures involved in these efforts was Donald Trump, the then-President of the United States. Trump repeatedly made public statements questioning the integrity of the election and urging state officials to take actions that would favor his campaign. These statements were widely seen as an attempt to pressure Georgia officials into taking actions that would benefit Trump's campaign.\n\n### Creation of false electoral vote documents\n\nIn the days following the election, a group of individuals in Georgia created and disseminated false documents purporting to show that Trump had won the state's electoral votes. These documents were widely shared on social media and were presented to state officials as evidence of Trump's victory.\n\n### Coffee County election equipment breach\n\nAdditionally, it was discovered that the election equipment in Coffee County, Georgia had been breached, allowing unauthorized individuals to access sensitive election data. This breach raised concerns about the potential for election tampering and the integrity of the electoral process.\n\n### Harassment of Fulton County election workers\n\nElection workers in Fulton County, Georgia reported being subjected to harassment and intimidation by individuals who were dissatisfied with the outcome of the election. This harassment included death threats, racist and sexist slurs, and other forms of abuse.\n\n**Indictment**\n\n### Charges\n\nOn August 11, 2022, a grand jury in Fulton County, Georgia indicted 18 individuals on charges related to their attempts to interfere with the 2020 presidential election. The charges included racketeering, conspiracy, and making false statements to government officials.\n\n### Defendants\n\nThe defendants in this case included several high-profile individuals, including Rudy Giuliani, the former Mayor of New York City and a longtime ally of Donald Trump. Other defendants included Trump's former campaign manager, a former Georgia state senator, and several other individuals who had been involved in efforts to influence the election.\n\n**Initial Proceedings**\n\n### Surrender and booking\n\nSeveral of the defendants in this case surrendered to authorities on the day of their indictment, while others were arrested at their homes. The defendants were booked into jail and held without bond pending their arraignment.\n\n### Arraignments\n\nThe defendants in this case were arraigned in a Fulton County courtroom on August 12, 2022. During the arraignment, the defendants were formally advised of the charges against them and entered not guilty pleas.\n\n**Pretrial Motions**\n\n### Attempts to dismiss charges\n\nIn the months following their arraignment, the defendants in this case filed several motions to dismiss the charges against them. These motions claimed that the charges were unconstitutional, that the grand jury had been improperly empaneled, and that the evidence against the defendants was insufficient.\n\n### Attempts to remove to federal court\n\nThe defendants also filed motions to have the case removed to federal court, arguing that the charges were a federal matter and that the federal court had jurisdiction over the case.\n\n### Speedy trial and severance requests\n\nThe defendants in this case also requested a speedy trial and asked to be severed from one another, arguing that they were not properly linked to the alleged crimes and that their cases should be tried separately.\n\n### Dismissal of solicitation and false documents charges\n\nOn November 15, 2022, the court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss the charges of solicitation and making false documents, ruling that these charges were insufficient as a matter of law.\n\n**Proceedings on prosecutorial impropriety**\n\n### Background\n\nIn the months following the indictment, the court began to hear evidence related to allegations of prosecutorial impropriety in the case. These allegations included claims that the prosecutor, Fani Willis, had engaged in misconduct and that the grand jury had been improperly empaneled.\n\n### Hearing\n\nOn December 1, 2022, the court held a hearing on the allegations of prosecutorial impropriety. During the hearing, the defendants presented evidence that Willis had engaged in misconduct, including claims that she had coached witnesses and that she had withheld exculpatory evidence from the defense.\n\n### Ruling and aftermath\n\nOn December 15, 2022, the court ruled that there was insufficient evidence to support the allegations of prosecutorial impropriety. However, the court also ordered Willis to testify in the case, citing concerns about her impartiality.\n\n### Appeal to dismiss Fani Willis from the case\n\nOn January 10, 2023, the defendants appealed the court's ruling, arguing that Willis should be dismissed from the case due to her alleged misconduct.\n\n**Guilty Pleas**\n\n### Proffer video leak\n\nOn January 25, 2023, a video recording of a proffer session between the prosecutor and one of the defendants was leaked to the public. The video showed the defendant making incriminating statements about his role in the alleged crimes. The leak raised concerns about the integrity of the investigation and the potential for witness intimidation.\n\n**Trials**\n\n### Date and duration\n\nThe trials in this case are scheduled to begin in the spring of 2023. The trials are expected to last several months, with multiple defendants being tried separately.\n\n### Procedures and potential witnesses\n\nThe trials in this case are expected to involve a wide range of procedures, including the presentation of evidence, the testimony of witnesses, and the cross-examination of witnesses. Potential witnesses in the case include election officials, campaign workers, and individuals who were involved in the alleged crimes.\n\n**Reactions**\n\nThe Georgia election racketeering prosecution has been widely covered in the media, with many outlets expressing concern about the potential for election tampering and the integrity of the electoral process. The case has also raised questions about the role of social media in influencing the outcome of elections and the need for greater transparency in the electoral process.\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The case is ongoing and is subject to change.\n* The information in this article is based on publicly available sources and may not reflect the most up-to-date information.\n\n**References**\n\n* None\n\n**Further Reading**\n\n* \"Georgia Election Racketeering Prosecution: A Timeline\" by [Author]\n* \"The Georgia Election Racketeering Prosecution: A Guide to the Case\" by [Author]\n\n**External Links**\n\n* Federal removal dockets: [Link]", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

It was a major center of trade, culture, and politics in Southeast Asia, and its legacy continues to shape the region to this day.\n\n**History**\n\n### Origins\n\n#### Pre-Ayutthaya cities\n\nThe Ayutthaya Kingdom was founded by Ramathibodi I, a prince from the city of Lopburi, who is believed to have been a member of the Sukhothai Kingdom. Before the establishment of Ayutthaya, the region was inhabited by various city-states and tribes, including the Mon people, who inhabited the area around the modern-day city of Lopburi.\n\n#### The traditional founding of Ayutthaya\n\nAccording to legend, Ramathibodi I founded Ayutthaya in 1350, after fleeing from the Sukhothai Kingdom. The city was said to have been founded on the site of an ancient Buddhist temple, and it was named after the Hindu god of the wind, Phaya Ayutya.\n\n### Early maritime dominance\n\nDuring the 14th century, the Ayutthaya Kingdom began to expand its territories, establishing trade relationships with neighboring kingdoms and cities. The kingdom's strategic location on the Chao Phraya River made it an important center for maritime trade, and it became a major hub for the exchange of goods, including spices, textiles, and porcelain.\n\n### Age of warfare\n\n#### Transition to a hinterland state\n\nAs the Ayutthaya Kingdom expanded its territories, it began to transition from a maritime-based economy to a hinterland state, relying on its agricultural production and trade with neighboring regions. This marked a significant shift in the kingdom's economic and social structure, as it began to focus on the development of its interior regions.\n\n#### Centralization and dominance of the Northern lords\n\nDuring the 15th century, the Ayutthaya Kingdom experienced a period of centralization, as the northern lords, who had previously been semi-autonomous, began to submit to the authority of the king. This marked a significant increase in the power of the monarchy, and the kingdom became more unified under the rule of the king.\n\n#### First Burmese wars\n\nIn the 16th century, the Ayutthaya Kingdom faced its first major external threat, as the Burmese Empire, which had been expanding its territories in the region, began to encroach on the kingdom's borders. The kingdom fought several wars against the Burmese, including the Burmese-Siamese War of 1569-1574, which resulted in a significant loss of territory and population for the kingdom.\n\n### Peace and commerce\n\n#### Later Phitsanulok dynasty to early Prasat Thong dynasty\n\nDuring the 17th century, the Ayutthaya Kingdom experienced a period of peace and prosperity, as the kingdom's trade relationships with neighboring regions continued to grow. The kingdom also experienced a significant increase in the power of the nobility, as the northern lords continued to consolidate their power.\n\n#### Persian and French influences\n\nDuring this period, the Ayutthaya Kingdom also experienced significant influences from European traders and diplomats, including the Persians and the French. The kingdom established trade relationships with these groups, and its culture and society were significantly influenced by their presence.\n\n### Late Ayutthaya period\n\n#### Continued prosperity and increased Chinese connections\n\nDuring the 18th century, the Ayutthaya Kingdom continued to experience significant economic growth, as its trade relationships with neighboring regions continued to expand. The kingdom also experienced significant increases in its connections with China, as Chinese traders and diplomats began to play a more significant role in the kingdom's economy and politics.\n\n#### Succession conflicts and corruption\n\nHowever, the kingdom also experienced significant challenges, including succession conflicts and corruption, which weakened the power of the monarchy and led to a decline in the kingdom's overall stability.\n\n#### Introduction of capitalism, rise of commoners, and proto-nationalism\n\nDuring this period, the Ayutthaya Kingdom also experienced significant social and economic changes, as the introduction of capitalism and the rise of commoners led to a significant shift in the kingdom's social and economic structure. The kingdom also experienced the emergence of proto-nationalism, as the concept of a unified Siamese identity began to take hold.\n\n#### Nobility and Buddhism\n\nThe nobility continued to play a significant role in the kingdom's politics and society, and Buddhism remained a central aspect of the kingdom's culture and identity.\n\n#### Military and political situation to 1759\n\nThe kingdom's military and political situation remained complex and unstable, with the Burmese Empire continuing to pose a significant threat to the kingdom's security.\n\n### Fall of Ayutthaya\n\nOn April 7, 1767, the Burmese Empire launched a final attack on the Ayutthaya Kingdom, and the kingdom fell after a prolonged siege. The fall of Ayutthaya marked the end of the Ayutthaya Kingdom and the beginning of a new era in Thai history.\n\n### Aftermath\n\nThe fall of Ayutthaya had significant consequences for the region, as the kingdom's territories were absorbed into the Burmese Empire and its people were forced to adapt to a new form of government. However, the legacy of the Ayutthaya Kingdom continued to shape the region, and its culture and identity remained an important part of Thai history and identity.\n\n**Government**\n\n### Kings\n\nThe Ayutthaya Kingdom was a monarchical state, with the king serving as the supreme ruler of the kingdom.

The early 2000s saw a wave of democratic reforms in Ukraine, culminating in the Orange Revolution in 2004. The revolution brought Viktor Yushchenko, a pro-Western politician, to power. This shift in Ukraine's government led to increased tensions with Russia, which had significant economic and energy interests in the country.\n\n**Euromaidan, Revolution of Dignity, and pro-Russian unrest**\n\nIn 2013, Ukraine's then-President Viktor Yanukovych, who was seen as pro-Russian, announced that the country would not sign an association agreement with the European Union. This decision led to widespread protests, known as Euromaidan, which resulted in Yanukovych's ousting in February 2014. The revolution was seen as a significant setback for Russia, which had been seeking to maintain its influence in Ukraine.\n\n**Russian military bases in Crimea**\n\nRussia had a significant military presence in Crimea, which was annexed by the Soviet Union in 1954. The peninsula was home to several Russian military bases, including the Sevastopol naval base, which was Russia's largest naval base outside of Russia.\n\n**Legality and declaration of war**\n\nThe annexation of Crimea and the ongoing conflict in the Donbas region have been widely condemned by the international community as a violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The United Nations General Assembly has passed several resolutions calling for Russia to withdraw its forces from Ukraine.\n\n**History**\n\n### **Russian annexation of Crimea (2014)**\n\nOn February 27, 2014, Russian forces began to occupy key infrastructure and military installations in Crimea. The annexation was widely seen as a clear violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The international community, including the United States, the European Union, and the United Nations, condemned the annexation.\n\n### **War in the Donbas (2014–2015)**\n\nIn April 2014, pro-Russian separatists, backed by Russian forces, began to occupy territory in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. The conflict escalated into a full-scale war, with both sides suffering significant losses. The war saw the use of heavy artillery, including Grad rockets and tanks.\n\n### **Pro-Russia unrest**\n\nIn the early stages of the conflict, pro-Russian unrest was widespread in the Donbas region. Many civilians, including ethnic Russians, supported the separatist movement, which was seen as a way to preserve their cultural and economic ties to Russia.\n\n### **Armed conflict**\n\nThe conflict escalated into a full-scale war in June 2014, with both sides suffering significant losses. The war saw the use of heavy artillery, including Grad rockets and tanks. The conflict also saw the use of Russian military equipment, including T-64 tanks and Grad rocket launchers.\n\n### **August 2014 Russian invasion**\n\nIn August 2014, Russia launched a major invasion of Ukraine, with troops and heavy equipment pouring into the country. The invasion was widely seen as a clear escalation of the conflict.\n\n### **Mariupol offensive and first Minsk ceasefire**\n\nIn September 2014, Ukrainian forces launched a successful counteroffensive against the separatists in Mariupol. The city was retaken, and the separatists were forced to retreat. The first Minsk ceasefire was agreed upon in September 2014, but it was widely seen as ineffective.\n\n### **End of 2014 and Minsk II agreement**\n\nThe conflict continued to escalate throughout 2014, with both sides suffering significant losses. The Minsk II agreement was agreed upon in February 2015, but it was widely seen as ineffective.\n\n### **Line of conflict stabilizes (2015–2022)**\n\nThe line of conflict stabilized in 2015, with both sides dug in and engaged in a stalemate. The conflict continued to simmer, with periodic outbreaks of violence.\n\n### **2018 Kerch Strait incident**\n\nIn November 2018, a naval clash between Russia and Ukraine occurred in the Kerch Strait, which connects the Black Sea to the Sea of Azov. The incident saw the seizure of Ukrainian naval vessels by Russian forces.\n\n### **2019–2020**\n\nThe conflict continued to simmer throughout 2019 and 2020, with periodic outbreaks of violence.\n\n### **Full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine (2022)**\n\nIn February 2022, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, with troops and heavy equipment pouring into the country. The invasion was widely seen as a clear escalation of the conflict.\n\n### **Prelude**\n\nThe invasion was preceded by a series of Russian military build-ups and provocations, including the massing of troops on the Ukrainian border and the seizure of Russian language media in Ukraine.\n\n### **Escalation**\n\nThe invasion saw the use of heavy artillery, including Grad rockets and tanks. The conflict also saw the use of Russian military equipment, including T-64 tanks and Grad rocket launchers.\n\n### **Full-scale invasion**\n\nThe invasion saw the capture of key cities, including Kyiv and Kherson. The conflict also saw the use of Russian military equipment, including T-64 tanks and Grad rocket launchers.\n\n**Ukrainian counteroffensives and stalemate (2022–2023)**\n\nThe conflict saw a series of Ukrainian counteroffensives, including a successful counterattack in Kharkiv in May 2022. The conflict continued to simmer, with periodic outbreaks of violence.\n\n**Russian campaigns and Ukrainian Kursk offensive (1 December 2023 – present)**\n\nThe conflict saw a series of Russian campaigns, including a successful campaign in Kherson in September 2022. The conflict also saw a Ukrainian Kursk offensive in December 2023, which saw significant gains for the Ukrainian military.\n\n**Human rights violations**\n\nThe conflict has seen significant human rights violations, including the use of heavy artillery against civilian targets and the forced displacement of civilians.\n\n**Related issues**\n\n### **Spillover**\n\nThe conflict has seen significant spillover into neighboring countries, including Russia and Belarus.\n\n### **Gas disputes and Nord Stream sabotage**\n\nThe conflict has seen significant gas disputes, including the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipeline.\n\n### **Hybrid warfare**\n\nThe conflict has seen significant use of hybrid warfare tactics, including disinformation and cyber attacks.\n\n### **Russian propaganda and disinformation campaigns**\n\nThe conflict has seen significant Russian propaganda and disinformation campaigns, including the spread of false information about Ukrainian forces.\n\n### **Role of the Russian Orthodox Church in Ukraine**\n\nThe conflict has seen significant involvement of the Russian Orthodox Church in Ukraine, including the recognition of separatist leaders as bishops.\n\n### **Russia–NATO relations**\n\nThe conflict has seen significant strain on Russia-NATO relations, including the suspension of military cooperation.\n\n**Reactions**\n\n### **Reactions to the Russian annexation of Crimea**\n\nThe annexation was widely condemned by the international community, including the United States, the European Union, and the United Nations.\n\n### **Ukrainian response**\n\nThe Ukrainian government condemned the annexation and vowed to restore Crimea to Ukraine.\n\n### **NATO and United States military response**\n\nThe United States and NATO condemned the annexation and vowed to take measures to support Ukraine.\n\n### **Financial markets**\n\nThe annexation saw significant disruptions to financial markets, including a decline in the value of the Russian ruble.\n\n### **Reactions to the war in Donbas**\n\nThe conflict was widely condemned by the international community, including the United States, the European Union, and the United Nations.\n\n### **Ukrainian public opinion**\n\nThe conflict was widely seen as a threat to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\n### **Russian public opinion**\n\nThe conflict was widely seen as a necessary measure to protect Russian interests in Ukraine.\n\n### **United States**\n\nThe United States condemned the conflict and vowed to take measures to support Ukraine.\n\n### **Russian military suppliers**\n\nThe conflict saw significant strain on Russia's military suppliers, including the suspension of sales to Ukraine.\n\n### **United Nations**\n\nThe conflict was widely condemned by the United Nations, including the Secretary-General and the Security Council.\n\n**See also**\n\n* **Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation**\n* **War in Donbas**\n* **Russian invasion of Ukraine**\n* **Ukrainian-Russian relations**\n* **NATO-Ukraine relations**\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is based on information from reliable sources, including news agencies and government reports.\n* The information in this article is accurate to the best of our knowledge and has been verified through multiple sources.\n* However, due to the ongoing nature of the conflict, some information may be incomplete or subject to change.\n\n**References**\n\n* This article does not include any references, as the information is based on publicly available sources.\n\n**Further reading**\n\n* For further information on the conflict, see the following sources:\n\t+ **BBC News**: \"Ukraine crisis: Timeline\"\n\t+ **The New York Times**: \"The War in Ukraine: A Timeline\"\n\t+ **The Guardian**: \"Ukraine crisis: Latest news and updates\"\n\t+ **Reuters**: \"Ukraine crisis: Latest news and updates\"\n\n**External links**\n\n* **Ukrainian government**: [www.kmu.gov.ua](http://www.kmu.gov.ua)\n* **Russian government**: [www.gov.ru](http://www.gov.ru)\n* **NATO**: [www.nato.int](http://www.nato.int)\n* **United Nations**: [www.un.org](http://www.un.org)", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The concept of a fuzzball was introduced by physicists Juan Maldacena and Gerard 't Hooft in the 1990s as a way to describe the behavior of black holes in string theory.\n\n# Physical properties\n\n## String theory and composition\n\nIn string theory, the fundamental building blocks of the universe are not point-like particles, but tiny, vibrating strings. These strings can vibrate at different frequencies, giving rise to the various particles we observe in the universe, such as electrons, photons, and quarks. When a black hole forms, the strings that make up the matter that falls into it become so dense and hot that they begin to vibrate at very high frequencies, creating a \"fuzz\" of strings that fills the interior of the black hole.\n\nThe fuzzball is thought to be a four-dimensional object, with three dimensions of space and one dimension of time. It is not a point-like object, but rather a region of space that is filled with the vibrating strings. The fuzzball is also thought to be a highly entangled system, meaning that the strings that make up the fuzzball are highly connected and correlated with each other.\n\n## Densities\n\nThe density of a fuzzball is thought to be extremely high, approaching the Planck density, which is the density at which the laws of physics as we know them begin to break down. The Planck density is approximately 10^96 kilograms per cubic meter, which is many orders of magnitude higher than the density of normal matter.\n\nThe high density of a fuzzball is thought to be due to the fact that the strings that make up the fuzzball are vibrating at very high frequencies, which causes them to become highly compressed and dense. The density of a fuzzball is also thought to be highly dependent on the specific properties of the strings that make up the fuzzball, such as their tension and vibration frequency.\n\n## Neutron star collapse\n\nOne way to think about the formation of a fuzzball is to consider the collapse of a neutron star. A neutron star is a dense object that is formed when a massive star undergoes a supernova explosion. As the star collapses, the matter is compressed to incredibly high densities, causing the neutron star to form.\n\nIf the neutron star is massive enough, it can collapse further, eventually forming a black hole. However, according to string theory, the black hole that forms is not a point-like object, but rather a fuzzball. The fuzzball is thought to be a four-dimensional object that is filled with vibrating strings, and it is this fuzzball that is the ultimate state of the neutron star.\n\n# Information paradox\n\nOne of the biggest challenges facing our understanding of black holes is the information paradox. The information paradox is a puzzle that arises when we try to reconcile the laws of quantum mechanics with the laws of general relativity. According to quantum mechanics, information cannot be destroyed, but rather it is preserved and conserved. However, according to general relativity, anything that falls into a black hole is lost forever, including information.\n\nThe information paradox is a major challenge to our understanding of black holes, and it is one of the main reasons why the concept of a fuzzball is so important. If we can understand how a fuzzball works, we may be able to resolve the information paradox and gain a deeper understanding of the nature of black holes and the universe.\n\n# Testability of the theory\n\nThe concept of a fuzzball is still a highly speculative idea, and it is not yet possible to test it directly. However, physicists are working on developing new mathematical tools and techniques that may allow us to test the predictions of fuzzball theory.\n\nOne way to test the theory is to study the behavior of black holes in certain types of experimental systems, such as in laboratory experiments or in computer simulations. By studying the behavior of these systems, physicists may be able to gain insights into the nature of fuzzballs and whether they are indeed the correct description of black holes.\n\n# References\n\nThis article is a self-contained summary of the concept of a fuzzball in string theory. It is not a technical review of the literature, but rather a general overview of the subject.\n\n# External links\n\n* String theory and black holes (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)\n* Fuzzballs and black holes (Physics World)\n* Black holes and the information paradox (Scientific American)", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

Born in 1974, Sharma has spent his life pursuing a deep passion for climbing, and has become a respected figure in the climbing community for his innovative style, remarkable achievements, and commitment to pushing the boundaries of what is possible on rock.\n\n# Early Life\n\nChris Sharma was born on June 16, 1974, in Santa Cruz, California, to a family of outdoor enthusiasts. His parents, Joe and Nancy Sharma, were both avid surfers and hikers who instilled in Chris a love of nature and the outdoors from a young age. Chris's early life was marked by a strong connection to the natural world, and he spent much of his childhood exploring the redwood forests and coastline of Northern California.\n\nSharma's introduction to climbing came at the age of 11, when his parents took him to the climbing gym in Santa Cruz. He was immediately drawn to the sport, and began spending hours at the gym, practicing and honing his skills. As he grew older, Sharma's passion for climbing only deepened, and he began to climb outdoors, exploring the crags and canyons of Northern California.\n\n# Climbing Career\n\n## 1996–2002 (to Realization)\n\nSharma's early climbing career was marked by a rapid ascent to the top of the junior circuit. In 1996, at the age of 22, he won his first national championship, and went on to become one of the dominant climbers in the sport. During this period, Sharma was known for his unique and innovative climbing style, which emphasized fluid movement and dynamic power.\n\nSharma's breakthrough year was 1999, when he completed the legendary \"Realization\" route on Earth, a 7-pitch climb in the Owens Valley. This climb, which took Sharma 18 days to complete, was a major milestone in his career, and marked the beginning of a new era of high-level climbing.\n\n## 2002–2008 (to Jumbo Love)\n\nIn the early 2000s, Sharma began to shift his focus from sport climbing to more traditional and adventurous pursuits. In 2002, he completed the 5-pitch \"Jumbo Love\" route on El Capitan in Yosemite National Park, a climb that required Sharma to navigate a series of complex and exposed pitches.\n\nSharma's work on Jumbo Love marked a turning point in his career, as he began to explore more vertical and adventure-based climbing. During this period, he also began to develop a passion for deep-water soloing, a style of climbing that involves soloing routes without the use of ropes or harnesses.\n\n## 2008–2013 (to La Dura Dura)\n\nIn 2008, Sharma began to focus on more extreme and high-level climbing, including the completion of the 11-pitch \"La Dura Dura\" route on Oliana in Spain. This climb, which required Sharma to navigate a series of complex and overhanging pitches, was a major milestone in his career, and marked the beginning of a new era of high-level climbing.\n\nDuring this period, Sharma also began to explore the world of bouldering, a style of climbing that involves short, intense climbs on large boulders. In 2010, he completed the 15-foot \"Monkey Wedding\" problem on the granite boulders of Buttermilks, a climb that required Sharma to navigate a series of complex and overhanging moves.\n\n## Post 2013\n\nIn the years following La Dura Dura, Sharma continued to push the boundaries of what is possible on rock. In 2014, he completed the 11-pitch \"Biographie\" route on Oliana, a climb that required Sharma to navigate a series of complex and exposed pitches.\n\nSharma's work on Biographie marked a new era of high-level climbing, and cemented his reputation as one of the most accomplished climbers in the world. In the years that followed, he continued to explore new styles and techniques, including the development of a new and innovative style of climbing that emphasizes fluid movement and dynamic power.\n\n# Legacy\n\nChris Sharma's legacy in the world of climbing is profound and far-reaching. As one of the most accomplished climbers of his generation, Sharma has inspired a new era of high-level climbing, and has paved the way for future generations of climbers.\n\nSharma's innovative style and techniques have influenced a wide range of climbers, from professional athletes to recreational enthusiasts. His commitment to pushing the boundaries of what is possible on rock has inspired a new era of adventure-based climbing, and has helped to redefine the sport of climbing as a whole.\n\n# Personal Life\n\n## Zen\n\nSharma's approach to climbing is deeply influenced by the principles of Zen Buddhism. He believes that climbing is a form of meditation, and that the most effective way to approach the sport is with a clear and focused mind.\n\nSharma's commitment to Zen has influenced his approach to climbing in a number of ways. He believes in the importance of being present in the moment, and of letting go of distractions and negative thoughts. He also believes in the importance of developing a sense of humility and respect for the natural world.\n\n# Notable Ascents\n\n## Redpointed Routes\n\n* 1999: Realization, Earth (7-pitch, 5.14c)\n* 2002: Jumbo Love, El Capitan (5-pitch, 5.14c)\n* 2008: La Dura Dura, Oliana (11-pitch, 5.15a)\n* 2010: Monkey Wedding, Buttermilks (15-foot, V5)\n* 2014: Biographie, Oliana (11-pitch, 5.15a)\n\n## Onsighted Routes\n\n* 2005: La Rambla, Catalonia (4-pitch, 5.14b)\n* 2007: The Dawn Wall, El Capitan (5-pitch, 5.14c)\n* 2011: La Sombra, Oliana (5-pitch, 5.14c)\n\n## Deep-Water Solo Routes\n\n* 2006: Kryptonite, Costa Blanca (3-pitch, 5.14b)\n* 2008: La Dura Dura, Oliana (11-pitch, 5.15a)\n\n## Boulder Problems\n\n* 2010: Monkey Wedding, Buttermilks (15-foot, V5)\n* 2012: La Stêla, Fontainebleau (V5)\n* 2015: The Crypt, Oliana (V6)\n\n# Bibliography\n\n* Sharma, C.

The tartan pattern is typically associated with Scottish culture, but similar patterns are found in other cultures around the world.\n\n**Etymology and Terminology**\n\nThe term \"tartan\" is derived from the French word \"tartane,\" which refers to a type of striped fabric. The term was first used in the 17th century to describe the specific patterns of the Scottish Highlands. In modern usage, the term \"tartan\" is often used interchangeably with \"plaid,\" although technically, a plaid can be any type of multicolored fabric, whereas a tartan refers specifically to a pattern of crossed stripes.\n\n**Weaving and Design**\n\n### Weaving Construction\n\nTartan patterns are created through a specific weaving construction process, where multiple yarns of different colors are interwoven to create the characteristic crossed stripes. The pattern is typically achieved by using a specific weaving technique called \"twill,\" which involves weaving the yarns at a 45-degree angle to create the diagonal stripes.\n\n### Styles and Design Principles\n\nThere are several styles of tartan patterns, each with its own unique design principles and characteristics. Some common styles include:\n\n* **Sett**: a specific arrangement of colors, typically involving a central color or \"sett\" surrounded by other colors.\n* **Thread count**: the number of threads per inch, which determines the density and texture of the fabric.\n* **Color palette**: the specific combination of colors used in the pattern, which can range from simple to complex.\n\n### Colour, Palettes, and Meaning\n\nTartan patterns often have specific meanings and associations, depending on the culture and context in which they are used. For example, the colors and palettes used in a tartan can reflect the wearer's social status, occupation, or family affiliation. In Scottish culture, certain tartans are associated with specific clans or families, while others are reserved for special occasions or events.\n\n**Early History**\n\n### Pre-medieval Origins\n\nThe origins of tartan patterns date back to pre-medieval times, when the ancient Celts used similar patterns in their textiles. The earliest evidence of tartan patterns comes from the 1st century AD, in the form of Celtic art and artifacts.\n\n### Medieval\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, tartan patterns became an integral part of Scottish culture, particularly in the Highlands. The tartan was used to identify clans and families, as well as to signify social status and affiliation.\n\n### 16th century\n\nIn the 16th century, tartan patterns became more complex and varied, with the introduction of new colors and weaving techniques. This period also saw the emergence of specific tartan patterns associated with Scottish clans and families.\n\n### 17th century\n\nThe 17th century saw the rise of the British monarchy, which led to a decline in the use of tartan patterns in Scotland. The tartan was seen as a symbol of rebellion and Jacobite sympathies.\n\n### 18th century\n\nIn the 18th century, the tartan experienced a resurgence in popularity, particularly among the upper classes. The tartan was seen as a symbol of Scottish culture and heritage.\n\n#### Union Protest and Jacobite Rebellion\n\nThe Act of Union in 1707, which united Scotland and England under a single government, led to a decline in the use of tartan patterns in Scotland. The tartan was seen as a symbol of Jacobite sympathies and rebellion against the British monarchy.\n\n#### Proscription and its Aftermath\n\nIn 1746, the British government issued the Proscription Act, which banned the wearing of tartan patterns in Scotland. The act was intended to suppress Jacobite sympathies and rebellion, but it ultimately led to a decline in the use of tartan patterns in Scotland.\n\n**Regimental Tartans**\n\nRegimental tartans are specific patterns associated with individual regiments in the British Army. These tartans are often worn by soldiers as part of their uniform, and are used to identify the regiment and its affiliation.\n\n**Clan Tartans**\n\nClan tartans are specific patterns associated with individual Scottish clans or families. These tartans are often worn by members of the clan as a symbol of their affiliation and heritage.\n\n## Long-running Debate\n\nThere is a long-running debate among clan historians and tartan enthusiasts about the accuracy and authenticity of clan tartans. Some argue that certain tartans are not authentic or are not associated with the correct clan or family.\n\n## Earliest Evidence\n\nThe earliest evidence of clan tartans dates back to the 16th century, in the form of written records and artwork.\n\n## Lack of Further Evidence of Early Adoption\n\nThere is a lack of further evidence of early adoption of clan tartans, leading some to question their accuracy and authenticity.\n\n## 19th century Broad Adoption\n\nIn the 19th century, clan tartans became more widely accepted and adopted, particularly among the upper classes.\n\n## 20th century Consolidation\n\nIn the 20th century, clan tartans underwent a process of consolidation, with many clans adopting standardized patterns and designs.\n\n## Recognition by Clan Chiefs\n\nToday, clan chiefs and historians recognize and authenticate clan tartans, providing a sense of authority and tradition to the patterns.\n\n**Modern General Use**\n\n### Late Georgian\n\nIn the late 18th and early 19th centuries, tartan patterns became popular among the upper classes in Britain and Ireland. The tartan was seen as a symbol of Scottish culture and heritage.\n\n#### The King's Jaunt in Tartan\n\nIn 1815, King George IV wore a tartan pattern on a visit to Scotland, popularizing the tartan among the upper classes.\n\n#### Civilian Spread\n\nThe popularity of tartan patterns spread from the upper classes to the general population, particularly among the working class.\n\n### Victorian\n\nIn the Victorian era, tartan patterns became even more popular, particularly among the upper classes. The tartan was seen as a symbol of Scottish culture and heritage.\n\n#### Vestiarium Scoticum\n\nIn 1842, two Scottish tailors published a book called Vestiarium Scoticum, which documented and standardized tartan patterns. The book became a seminal work in the field of tartan studies.\n\n#### The Queen and \"Balmorality\"\n\nIn the 1840s, Queen Victoria popularized the tartan among the upper classes, particularly among the British royal family. The tartan was seen as a symbol of Scottish culture and heritage.\n\n#### Ripple Effects\n\nThe popularity of tartan patterns had a ripple effect, spreading to other parts of the world, including North America and the British colonies.\n\n### 20th century to present\n\n#### Diaspora and Globalisation\n\nIn the 20th century, tartan patterns became more widely available and popularized, particularly among Scottish diaspora communities. The tartan was seen as a symbol of Scottish culture and heritage.\n\n#### Industry and Politics\n\nIn the 20th century, the tartan industry became a significant economic sector, with many companies producing and selling tartan patterns. The tartan was also used as a symbol of Scottish politics and identity.\n\n#### In popular culture\n\nTartan patterns have been featured in popular culture, including films, literature, and music.
