The election saw 150 seats up for grabs, with all incumbents seeking re-election except for a few.\n\n# Background\n\nThe 2022 Texas House of Representatives election was part of a broader effort to reshape the Texas Legislature. The Republican Party retained a strong presence in the state, and the election saw a significant amount of money spent on various campaigns.\n\n# Redistricting\n\nThe Texas Legislature underwent redistricting in 2021, with the goal of adjusting the boundaries of the state's congressional and legislative districts. The new map, approved by the Republican-dominated legislature, was widely criticized by Democrats and voting rights advocates.\n\n## Seats without incumbents\n\nA total of 14 seats were open due to retirements or other factors. This allowed for new candidates to emerge and for the Republican Party to gain a foothold in some previously Democratic strongholds.\n\n## Double-bunked incumbents\n\nIn some cases, incumbents were paired together in the same district, forcing them to compete against each other. This occurred in districts 19, 21, and 47.\n\n# Retirements\n\nSeveral incumbents chose not to run for re-election, including:\n\n* Rep. Craig Goldman (R-Austin)\n* Rep. Gina Hinojosa (D-Austin)\n* Rep. Donna Howard (D-Austin)\n\n# Special elections\n\nA special election was held on July 27, 2022, to fill the vacant seat in District 34. The winner, Tracy King (D), won the election with 63% of the vote.\n\n# Incumbents defeated\n\nSeveral incumbents were defeated in the primary or general election.\n\n## In primaries\n\n* Rep. Jon Rosenthal (D-Houston) lost his primary bid to a new challenger.\n* Rep. Jeff Leach (R-Plano) was defeated in his primary after announcing his retirement.\n* Rep. Dade Phelan (R-Beaumont) won the primary but was later defeated in the general election.\n\n### Democrats\n\n* Rep. Jarvis Johnson (D-Houston) lost his primary bid to a new challenger.\n* Rep. Ana-Maria Ramos (D-Dallas) lost her primary bid to a new challenger.\n\n### Republicans\n\n* Rep. Matt Schaefer (R-Tyler) lost his primary bid to a new challenger.\n* Rep. Jeff Ellington (R-Houston) lost his primary bid to a new challenger.\n\n# Predictions\n\n## Statewide\n\nPolls suggested that the Republican Party would retain control of the Texas House of Representatives. According to a survey conducted by the University of Texas/Texas Tribune, 53% of likely voters supported the Republican Party, while 42% supported the Democratic Party.\n\n## Competitive districts\n\nSeveral districts were considered competitive, including Districts 1, 3, 6, 7, 9, 10, 18, 22, 25, 31, 33, 34, 37, 39, 40, 42, 45, 47, 55, 56, 58, 60, 63, 67, 70, 72, 75, 77, 79, 82, 84, 85, 87, 90, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 99, 100, 102, 103, 105, 106, 107, 108, 110, 111, 112, 113, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 121, 122, 123, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, and 150.\n\n# Summary of results\n\n## Statewide\n\nThe Republican Party retained control of the Texas House of Representatives, winning 85 seats to the Democratic Party's 64.\n\n## Close races\n\nSeveral districts were decided by a margin of less than 5 percentage points, including:\n\n* District 1: Chris Paddie (R) vs. Paul Gray (D) (55.14% to 44.86%)\n* District 3: Justin Holland (R) vs. Deanna Metzler (D) (53.36% to 46.64%)\n* District 6: Matt Schaefer (R) vs. Jason Ross (D) (52.35% to 47.65%)\n* District 7: Jay Dean (R) vs. Shannon

The team was founded in 1966 and has a rich history in both domestic and international competitions.\n\n**History**\n\n### Founding, early years & First Golden Age (1966–1988)\n\nAEL Limassol B.C. was founded in 1966 by a group of enthusiasts who wanted to promote basketball in Limassol. The team started competing in the Cypriot Second Division and quickly rose through the ranks, earning promotion to the top division in 1969. The club's early years were marked by modest success, with the team finishing as high as third in the Cypriot First Division.\n\nAEL's first golden age began in the late 1970s, with the team winning its first Cypriot championship in 1979. The team's success continued throughout the 1980s, with AEL winning three more Cypriot championships and reaching the final of the Balkan League in 1985.\n\n### Decline, relegation & return to glory (1989–2001)\n\nThe late 1980s and early 1990s saw a decline in AEL's fortunes, with the team experiencing relegation to the Cypriot Second Division in 1991. However, the team's spirit and determination remained strong, and AEL was able to bounce back to the top division in 1994.\n\nThe club's second golden age began in the late 1990s, with AEL winning its first Cypriot championship since 1987 in 1999. The team's success continued throughout the early 2000s, with AEL reaching the final of the Cypriot Cup in 2001.\n\n### Second Golden Age & various European successes (2002–2010)\n\nAEL's second golden age began in 2002, with the team winning its third Cypriot championship in five years. The team's success continued throughout the early 2000s, with AEL reaching the final of the Balkan League in 2004 and the final of the Cypriot Cup in 2005.\n\n**The initial Dragan Raca era (2002–2005)**\n\nDragan Raca, a former Yugoslavian international, was appointed as the team's head coach in 2002. Under Raca's guidance, AEL won its first Cypriot championship in five years in 2004. The team's success continued throughout the 2004-05 season, with AEL reaching the final of the Cypriot Cup.\n\n**Organising the FIBA EuroCup All-Star Day Limassol & interest to join Greek A1 Basketball League (2006–2008)**\n\nIn 2006, AEL organised the FIBA EuroCup All-Star Day Limassol, which was a major success. The event brought together some of the world's top basketball players, including NBA stars and European champions. The event was a major boost for the club, both financially and in terms of international recognition.\n\nThe club's interest in joining the Greek A1 Basketball League was also sparked during this period. AEL saw the opportunity to compete against some of the best teams in Europe and to gain more international experience. However, the move was ultimately not pursued.\n\n**Transformation from EuroChallenge contenders to EuroChallenge favourites (2008–2010)**\n\nAEL's success in the FIBA EuroChallenge in 2008 marked a major turning point for the club.

The team's success in the EuroChallenge continued throughout the 2009-10 season, with AEL finishing as one of the top teams in the competition.\n\n### Descent into obscurity, dissolution & reformation (2011–2017)\n\nThe 2010-11 season saw a decline in AEL's fortunes, with the team experiencing relegation to the Cypriot Second Division. The club's fortunes continued to decline throughout the 2010s, with AEL experiencing financial difficulties and a decline in popularity.\n\nIn 2017, the club was dissolved due to financial difficulties. However, the club's legacy lived on, and in 2018, the club was reformed and began competing in the Cypriot Division A.\n\n### Recent history (2018–present)\n\n**Return to Division A & reaching two Cup finals (2018–2022)**\n\nAEL's return to the Cypriot Division A in 2018 marked a new era for the club. The team's performance in the league was a huge success, with AEL finishing as one of the top teams in the competition. The team's success in the Cypriot Cup continued throughout the 2019-20 season, with AEL reaching the final of the competition.\n\n**Gradual improvements & participation in the Balkan League (2023–)**\n\nAEL's participation in the Balkan League in 2023 marked a major milestone for the club. The team's performance in the competition was a huge success, with AEL finishing as one of the top teams in the competition. The team's success in the Balkan League continued throughout the 2023-24 season, with AEL finishing as one of the top teams in the competition.\n\n**Stadium**\n\nAEL Limassol B.C. plays its home games at the Tassos Markou Arena, which has a seating capacity of 2,500.

The rebellion was a response to the tensions and conflicts that arose between the British colonial government and the gold miners who had flocked to the region in search of fortune. This article will explore the origins of the rebellion, the events that led up to it, the rebellion itself, and its aftermath.\n\nOrigins in the Victorian gold rush\n\nThe discovery of gold in 1851 led to a massive influx of people to the Ballarat region, with many settling in the area known as the Goldfields. The gold rush created a sense of excitement and opportunity, but it also led to conflicts between the miners and the colonial government.\n\nProtests on the goldfields: 1851–1854\n\nThe first protests on the goldfields began in 1851, when the miners demanded better working conditions and more favorable treatment from the government. The protests continued throughout the early 1850s, with the miners becoming increasingly frustrated with the government's handling of the situation.\n\n### La Trobe introduces monthly mining tax as protests begin\n\nIn 1852, Governor Charles La Trobe introduced a monthly mining tax, which further angered the miners. The tax was seen as an attempt by the government to exploit the miners and take advantage of the gold rush for its own gain.\n\n### First gold commissioner arrives in Ballarat\n\nIn 1853, the first gold commissioner, William Wright, arrived in Ballarat to oversee the goldfields. However, Wright's appointment was met with resistance from the miners, who saw him as a symbol of the government's attempts to control and exploit them.\n\n### Bendigo Petition and the Red Ribbon Movement\n\nIn 1853, a petition was presented to the government from the miners of Bendigo, which demanded reforms and better treatment from the government. The petition was known as the Bendigo Petition, and it was followed by the formation of the Red Ribbon Movement, which advocated for the rights of the miners.\n\n### Legislative Council calls for Commission of Inquiry\n\nIn 1854, the Legislative Council called for a Commission of Inquiry into the treatment of the miners and the government's handling of the goldfields. The commission was tasked with investigating the grievances of the miners and making recommendations for reform.\n\n### Hotham replaces La Trobe\n\nIn 1854, Governor Charles Hotham replaced Governor La Trobe, who had been under pressure from the miners and the government to address the growing tensions on the goldfields.\n\nTensions escalate\n\nThe tensions on the goldfields continued to escalate throughout 1854, with the miners becoming increasingly frustrated with the government's handling of the situation.\n\n### Murder of James Scobie and the burning of the Eureka hotel\n\nIn December 1854, James Scobie, a miner who had been involved in the Red Ribbon Movement, was murdered by a group of men believed to be associated with the government. The murder was seen as a provocation by the miners, and it led to the burning of the Eureka hotel, which was seen as a symbol of the government's presence on the goldfields.\n\n### Ballarat Reform League meetings\n\nIn December 1854, a series of meetings was held by the Ballarat Reform League, which was a group of miners who were advocating for reform and better treatment from the government. The meetings were seen as a call to action by the miners, and they helped to galvanize support for the rebellion.\n\n### Escalating violence as military convoy looted\n\nIn December 1854, a military convoy was sent to the goldfields to quell the growing unrest. However, the convoy was met with resistance from the miners, who looted the convoy and took control of the situation.\n\nOpen rebellion\n\nThe events of December 1854 marked the beginning of the open rebellion on the goldfields. The miners, who had been frustrated with the government's handling of the situation, took matters into their own hands and rose up against the authorities.\n\n### Paramilitary mobilisation and swearing allegiance to the Southern Cross\n\nIn December 1854, the miners mobilized a paramilitary force, which was known as the Southern Cross. The force was made up of miners who were willing to fight for their rights and their freedom. The Southern Cross was seen as a symbol of the rebellion, and it was flown by the miners as a flag.\n\n### Fortification of the Eureka lead\n\nIn December 1854, the miners fortified the Eureka lead, which was a ridge that overlooked the goldfields. The fortification was seen as a strategic move by the miners, who were preparing for battle.\n\n#### Vinegar Hill blunder: Irish dimension factors in dwindling numbers at stockade\n\nThe Eureka rebellion was also marked by a significant Irish dimension. Many of the miners who were involved in the rebellion were Irish, and they played a key role in the events that unfolded. However, the blunder at Vinegar Hill, which was a key location for the rebels, was a turning point in the rebellion. The blunder, which was made by an Irish rebel, led to a significant loss of life and a dwindling number of rebels at the stockade.\n\n#### Departing detachment of Independent Californian Rangers leaves small garrison behind\n\nIn December 1854, a detachment of Independent Californian Rangers left the goldfields, leaving behind a small garrison. The garrison was made up of soldiers who were tasked with quelling the rebellion.\n\nBattle of the Eureka Stockade\n\nThe battle of the Eureka Stockade was a pivotal event in the Eureka rebellion. The battle took place on December 3, 1854, and it was a clash between the rebels and the authorities. The battle was fierce, with both sides suffering significant losses.\n\nAftermath\n\nThe aftermath of the battle was marked by a series of trials for sedition and high treason. Many of the rebels were arrested and charged with sedition, and some were sentenced to death. However, the trials also highlighted the injustices of the system, and they helped to galvanize support for the rebellion.\n\n### Trials for sedition and high treason\n\nIn 1855, a series of trials was held for sedition and high treason. Many of the rebels were arrested and charged with sedition, and some were sentenced to death. However, the trials also highlighted the injustices of the system, and they helped to galvanize support for the rebellion.\n\n### Commission of Inquiry report\n\nIn 1855, the Commission of Inquiry report was released, which highlighted the injustices of the system and recommended reforms. The report was seen as a vindication of the rebels, and it helped to galvanize support for the rebellion.\n\n### Peter Lalor enters parliament\n\nIn 1856, Peter Lalor, one of the leaders of the Eureka rebellion, entered parliament. Lalor's election was seen as a victory for the rebellion, and it marked a significant turning point in the history of Australia.\n\nLocation of Bakery Hill and the Eureka Stockade\n\nThe Eureka Stockade was located on a ridge overlooking the goldfields, and it was close to Bakery Hill. The stockade was a fortified position that was used by the rebels during the battle.\n\nPolitical legacy\n\nThe Eureka rebellion had a significant impact on the politics of Australia. The rebellion highlighted the injustices of the system, and it led to a series of reforms. The rebellion also marked a significant turning point in the history of Australia, and it helped to galvanize support for the rebellion.\n\nCommemoration\n\nThe Eureka rebellion has been commemorated in a number of ways.

The film is a remake of the 1940 animated film of the same name by Walt Disney Productions. It is a retelling of the classic children's novel by Carlo Collodi, The Adventures of Pinocchio.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film follows the story of Geppetto, a poor and lonely woodcarver who creates a puppet boy from a piece of pine wood, naming him Pinocchio. Pinocchio is brought to life by a magical blue fairy, who warns him that he will become a real boy only if he proves himself to be brave, truthful, and unselfish. However, Pinocchio is prone to telling lies and gets into various troubles, which often lead him to get into the clutches of the villainous Coachman, who seeks to exploit children's naivety for his own gain.\n\nAs Pinocchio navigates the challenges of being a living being, he meets a cast of colorful characters, including a cricket named Jiminy who serves as his conscience, and a beautiful and kind-hearted woman named Sophia, who becomes his love interest. Along the way, Pinocchio must confront his own flaws and learn to take responsibility for his actions.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Tom Hanks as Geppetto\n* Benjamin Evan Ainsworth as Pinocchio\n* Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Jiminy Cricket\n* Cynthia Erivo as The Blue Fairy\n* Luke Evans as The Coachman\n* Keegan-Michael Key as Honest John\n* Lorraine Bracco as Sofia the Talking Cat\n* Kelsey Grammer as Stregatto\n* Chris Noth as The Emperor of the Fairies\n\n**Production**\n\n### Development\n\nThe idea of a live-action remake of Pinocchio was first discussed in the early 1990s, but it wasn't until 2015 that the project was officially announced, with Robert Zemeckis set to direct and Chris Weitz to write the screenplay. The film's production was delayed several times due to various reasons, including the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n### Casting\n\nTom Hanks was cast as Geppetto, a role that he had been attached to for several years. Benjamin Evan Ainsworth was cast as Pinocchio, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt was cast as Jiminy Cricket. The rest of the cast was rounded out by a talented ensemble of actors, including Cynthia Erivo, Luke Evans, and Kelsey Grammer.\n\n### Filming\n\nPrincipal photography for the film began in September 2020 and concluded in March 2021. The film was shot on location in Italy, with many of the scenes filmed in the picturesque town of Venice. The film's visual effects were created by Sony Pictures Imageworks, with the help of a team of over 100 artists and technicians.\n\n### Visual effects and animation\n\nThe film's visual effects were a key aspect of its production, with a team of artists and technicians working to create the fantastical world of Pinocchio. The film's animation was created using a combination of traditional animation techniques and computer-generated imagery (CGI). The result was a visually stunning film that brought the classic characters to life in a way that was both faithful to the original and entirely new.\n\n**Music**\n\nThe film's score was composed by John Williams, who has worked with Robert Zemeckis on several previous projects. The score is a sweeping and emotional work that perfectly captures the spirit of the film. The film's soundtrack also features a number of original songs, including \"This Is the Waltz\" and \"For All the Children\".\n\n**Marketing**\n\nThe film's marketing campaign was extensive, with a series of trailers and promotional materials released over several months. The film's promotional campaign included a number of tie-ins with popular brands and franchises, including Disney and Pixar. The film's marketing team also created a number of interactive experiences and promotions that allowed fans to engage with the film in new and innovative ways.\n\n**Release**\n\nThe film was released in the United States on September 17, 2022, in a number of theaters. The film was also released on streaming platforms, including Disney+ and Amazon Prime Video.\n\n**Reception**\n\n### Audience viewership\n\nThe film was a commercial success, grossing over $250 million at the box office worldwide. The film also performed well in terms of audience viewership, with many viewers praising its nostalgic value and faithfulness to the original.\n\n### Critical response\n\nThe film received generally positive reviews from critics, with many praising its visuals, performances, and faithfulness to the original. However, some critics felt that the film was too long and that the pacing was uneven. The film holds a 72% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 350 reviews, with an average rating of 6.4/10.\n\n**Accolades**\n\nThe film received a number of awards and nominations, including several Academy Award nominations. The film won the Critics Choice Movie Award for Best Visual Effects, and was nominated for several other awards, including the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Pinocchio (1940 film)\n* The Adventures of Pinocchio (novel)\n* Walt Disney Productions\n* Robert Zemeckis\n* Chris Weitz\n\n**References**\n\nN/A\n\n**External links**\n\n* Pinocchio (2022 live-action film) on IMDb\n* Pinocchio (2022 live-action film) on Disney+\n* Pinocchio (2022 live-action film) on Amazon Prime Video", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

Barry's life is turned upside down when he is struck by lightning during a storm and falls into a mysterious, yellow-lit cave. The next morning, Barry discovers that he has developed the ability to move at superhuman speeds.\n\nAs Barry struggles to understand and control his new powers, he meets Iris West, a reporter who has been investigating a series of robberies in the city. Barry soon learns that the robberies are being committed by a metahuman known as the Reverse-Flash, who is revealed to be Eobard Thawne, a time-traveling villain from the future.\n\nBarry, with the help of his friend Cisco Ramon and his mentor Joe West, sets out to stop the Reverse-Flash and learn more about his powers. Along the way, he discovers that the Reverse-Flash is using a device that allows him to travel through time and commit crimes in the past.\n\nAs the plot thickens, Barry and the Reverse-Flash engage in a series of intense battles, with Barry using his powers to try and stop the villain.

The film is a spin-off of the DC Extended Universe and serves as a companion piece to the 2019 film Shazam!. Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra and written by Adam Sztykiel, Rory Hammers, and Christian Wagener, the film stars Dwayne Johnson as the title character, alongside Aldis Hodge, Pierce Brosnan, and Sarah Shahi.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film takes place in ancient Kahndaq, where the powerful sorcerer Shazam (played by Aldis Hodge) is imprisoned by the ruling council for killing the people of the city. Shazam warns the people that if he is freed, the world will be destroyed. The film then cuts to the present day, where we see the modern-day version of Shazam, aka Adrianna Tomaz (played by Sarah Shahi), who is the daughter of a Kahndaqian warrior. Adrianna is on a mission to save her people from the evil dictator Intergang, led by the ruthless Ishmael (played by Marwan Kenzari).\n\nMeanwhile, in the United States, we see the superhero Black Adam, aka Teth-Adam (played by Dwayne Johnson), a powerful magician from ancient Kahndaq who has been awakened from his tomb by Adrianna's attempts to free her people. Black Adam soon discovers that he has been brought back to life for a reason: to exact revenge on the world that he feels has wronged him.

Mohun Bagan is one of the most successful and iconic football clubs in India, with a reputation for producing talented players and competing at the highest level.\n\n**History**\n\n### Early years (1889–99)\n\nMohun Bagan was founded in 1889 by a group of British expatriates and Indian enthusiasts, with the aim of promoting football in the city of Kolkata. The club was initially known as the \"Mohun Bagan Athletic Club\" and was named after the Bengali poet and social reformer, Mahendranath Datta, who was also known as \"Mohun Bagan\". The club's early years were marked by a focus on promoting physical education and sportsmanship, with a emphasis on rugby and athletics.\n\n### Administrative and tactical overhaul under Subedar-major Sailen Basu (1900s)\n\nIn the early 20th century, the club underwent a significant administrative and tactical overhaul under the leadership of Subedar-major Sailen Basu. Basu, who was a skilled footballer and administrator, introduced a new system of play that emphasized speed, agility, and teamwork.

Mohun Bagan's players also played a crucial role in India's successful campaign in the 1938 Asian Games, where the team won the gold medal.\n\n### Struggle with consistency (1948–1950s)\n\nIn the post-independence period, Mohun Bagan experienced a period of struggle with consistency. The club faced several challenges, including a decline in finances, a lack of infrastructure, and a shortage of talented players. Despite these challenges, the club continued to compete at the national level, participating in several tournaments and championships.\n\n### The golden team (1960-64)\n\nThe 1960s were a golden era for Mohun Bagan, as the club experienced a period of unprecedented success.

However, the club experienced a revival under the leadership of P. K. Banerjee, who took over as coach in 1965.

The exercises were a response to a visit by United States House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan in August 2022, which was widely seen as a provocation by the Chinese government. The military exercises were a significant escalation of tensions between China and Taiwan, and had implications for regional security and stability.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Incursions into Taiwan ADIZ\n\nThe Taiwan Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) is a buffer zone around Taiwan that is monitored by Taiwanese air defense systems. The ADIZ is designed to detect and respond to potential security threats from Taiwan's neighbors. In recent years, the PLA has increased its military activity around Taiwan's ADIZ, with frequent incursions by Chinese fighter jets and surveillance aircraft.\n\nIn the months leading up to the 2022 military exercises, the PLA had been conducting regular incursions into Taiwan's ADIZ, with some reports suggesting that Chinese aircraft were entering the zone on a daily basis. These incursions were seen as a challenge to Taiwan's sovereignty and a demonstration of China's military strength.\n\n### Escalation of tensions\n\nThe visit by Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan in August 2022 was a significant escalation of tensions between the United States and China. Pelosi's visit was seen as a provocation by the Chinese government, which had long opposed any official visits by high-ranking US officials to Taiwan. In response to Pelosi's visit, the PLA began conducting military exercises around Taiwan, including missile tests and air and naval patrols.\n\nThe Chinese government also imposed economic sanctions on Taiwan, banning the importation of Taiwanese goods and restricting Taiwanese exports to China. The sanctions were seen as an attempt to pressure Taiwan into accepting Chinese dominance and to undermine the island's economic stability.\n\n**Military exercises**\n\nThe PLA conducted a series of military exercises around Taiwan in August and September 2022, including missile tests and air and naval patrols. The exercises were a significant escalation of tensions between China and Taiwan, and had implications for regional security and stability.\n\n### Missile tests\n\nThe PLA conducted several missile tests around Taiwan during the military exercises, including tests of ballistic missiles and cruise missiles. The tests were seen as a demonstration of China's military capabilities and a warning to Taiwan and the United States of the potential costs of any military conflict.\n\n### Air and naval patrols\n\nThe PLA also conducted air and naval patrols around Taiwan during the military exercises, including flights by Chinese fighter jets and naval vessels. The patrols were seen as a demonstration of China's military presence in the region and a challenge to Taiwan's sovereignty.\n\n**Reactions**\n\n### Japan\n\nJapan reacted to the 2022 Chinese military exercises around Taiwan with concern, with Japanese Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi calling for calm and restraint. Japan also increased its military presence in the region, including deploying fighter jets and naval vessels to the area.\n\n### North Korea\n\nNorth Korea reacted to the 2022 Chinese military exercises around Taiwan with support, with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un congratulating China on its \"bold and courageous\" actions. North Korea also increased its military activity in the region, including tests of ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons.\n\n### Russia\n\nRussia reacted to the 2022 Chinese military exercises around Taiwan with support, with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov calling for a \"multi-polar world\" and criticizing the United States for its \"aggressive\" policies in the region. Russia also increased its military presence in the region, including deploying troops and equipment to its military bases in the Far East.\n\n### United States\n\nThe United States reacted to the 2022 Chinese military exercises around Taiwan with concern, with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken calling for calm and restraint. The US also increased its military presence in the region, including deploying fighter jets and naval vessels to the area.\n\nThe US also imposed economic sanctions on China in response to the military exercises, including restrictions on the export of US technology and goods. The sanctions were seen as an attempt to pressure China into halting its military activity around Taiwan and to undermine the island's economic stability.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe 2022 Chinese military exercises around Taiwan had significant implications for regional security and stability. The exercises were a demonstration of China's military capabilities and a challenge to Taiwan's sovereignty, and had implications for the United States and other countries in the region.\n\nThe exercises also highlighted the tensions between China and Taiwan, and the potential for military conflict between the two sides. The exercises were a reminder of the need for diplomacy and dialogue to resolve the conflict, and to prevent further escalation of tensions.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Taiwan–China relations\n* China–United States relations\n* Taiwan Strait crisis\n* People's Liberation Army\n* Taiwan Air Defense Identification Zone", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

This group is often considered a sub-group of Millennials, but with distinct characteristics shaped by their unique experiences and cultural context.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe term \"Zillennials\" is a portmanteau of \"Z\" and \"Millennials,\" with \"Z\" representing the next generation or \"zero\" (indicating a new beginning). The term was coined to describe the distinct characteristics and behaviors of this younger demographic, which is often seen as a bridge between the traditional Millennial generation and the emerging Generation Alpha.\n\n**Birth date and age range**\n\nThe exact birth dates that define the Zillennial generation are not universally agreed upon, but generally, it is considered to span from around 1997 to 2012. This places the Zillennials in the younger end of the Millennial spectrum, with some sources suggesting they are the first generation to be born entirely in the 21st century.\n\n**Characteristics**\n\nThe Zillennials are shaped by a unique blend of technological, cultural, and economic factors that distinguish them from previous generations. Some of the key characteristics of the Zillennials include:\n\n### **Arts and culture**\n\nThe Zillennials are known for their eclectic tastes in music, art, and literature. They are often drawn to independent and underground artists, and have a strong appreciation for the DIY ethos. Social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram have become essential tools for Zillennials to discover and share new music, art, and fashion trends.\n\nZillennials are also more likely to engage with traditional art forms like painting and sculpture, but with a modern twist. They often incorporate elements of technology, such as augmented reality and virtual reality, into their artistic expressions.\n\n### **Economic activity**\n\nZillennials are growing up in a time of economic uncertainty, with many facing high levels of student debt and limited job prospects. As a result, they are often more entrepreneurial and adaptable, with a strong desire to start their own businesses or side hustles.\n\nThe gig economy has become a major driver of Zillennial economic activity, with many young people choosing to work as freelancers, contractors, or part-time employees. This has led to a shift away from traditional 9-to-5 employment and towards more flexible and autonomous work arrangements.\n\n### **Health**\n\nZillennials are growing up in a time of increased awareness about mental health, with many open discussions about anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues. As a result, they are often more proactive about seeking help and support for their mental health.\n\nThe Zillennials are also more likely to prioritize physical health and wellness, with a strong focus on fitness, nutrition, and self-care. Social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok have created a culture of body positivity and self-acceptance, with many young people promoting healthy and inclusive messages.\n\n### **Personal values**\n\nZillennials are known for their strong sense of social justice and activism. They are often more likely to engage in volunteer work, activism, and community service, with a strong focus on issues like climate change, inequality, and social justice.\n\nThe Zillennials are also more likely to prioritize work-life balance and flexibility, with a strong desire for autonomy and independence. They are often more open to non-traditional relationships and family structures, with a growing acceptance of LGBTQ+ rights and identities.\n\n### **Political activity**\n\nZillennials are growing up in a time of intense political polarization, with many feeling disconnected from traditional party politics. As a result, they are often more likely to engage in grassroots activism and community organizing, with a focus on local issues and causes.\n\nThe Zillennials are also more likely to prioritize issue-based voting, with a strong focus on issues like climate change, healthcare, and education. They are often more open to new and innovative solutions, with a growing acceptance of progressive policies and ideas.\n\n### **Social life**\n\nZillennials are growing up in a time of intense social media use, with many young people spending hours each day on platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and Snapchat. As a result, they are often more connected and social, with a strong desire for community and connection.\n\nThe Zillennials are also more likely to prioritize in-person connections and relationships, with a strong focus on face-to-face interactions and experiences. They are often more open to new and diverse social experiences, with a growing acceptance of cultural and social differences.\n\n### **Technology**\n\nZillennials are growing up in a time of rapid technological change, with many young people embracing new technologies and innovations. As a result, they are often more tech-savvy and adaptable, with a strong desire to learn and explore new technologies.\n\nThe Zillennials are also more likely to prioritize digital literacy and online safety, with a growing awareness of cybersecurity and data protection issues. They are often more open to new and innovative technologies, with a growing acceptance of AI, blockchain, and other emerging technologies.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Generation Z\n* Millennial generation\n* Generation Alpha\n* Generational theory\n* Social media\n* Technology\n\n**References**\n\nNote: Due to the nature of Wikipedia, there are no specific references or citations provided in this article.\n\n**Further reading**\n\n* \"The Zillennial: A New Generation of Young Adults\" by Andrew J.

Published in 1553, the book is a comprehensive collection of images and descriptions of notable individuals from ancient and modern times. This article will provide an overview of the iconographic bases and authorship, publication history, reception, and significance of the Promptuarium Iconum Insigniorum.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe Promptuarium Iconum Insigniorum, which translates to \"Treasury of Noteworthy Images,\" is a groundbreaking work that aimed to document the lives and achievements of significant individuals from various fields, including politics, art, literature, and science. Rouillé's work was a pioneering effort in creating a visual and textual representation of historical figures, paving the way for future iconographic and biographical publications.\n\n**Iconographic bases and authorship**\n\nGuillaume Rouillé, a native of Amiens, France, studied at the University of Paris before becoming a Dominican friar. His interest in history and iconography led him to create the Promptuarium Iconum Insigniorum, which he dedicated to King Henry II of France. Rouillé drew inspiration from earlier works, such as the \"Imagines Illustrationis\" by Johannes Kameniatis, and incorporated elements from various sources, including classical texts, coins, and other visual representations.\n\nRouillé's iconographic approach was characterized by the use of woodcuts, which provided a more affordable and accessible means of disseminating images compared to engravings or paintings. The woodcuts were often crude and simplistic, but they served the purpose of conveying the essence of the individuals depicted. The author's emphasis on accuracy and detail is evident in the extensive descriptions accompanying each image, which included biographical information, achievements, and notable characteristics.\n\n**Publication history**\n\nThe Promptuarium Iconum Insigniorum was first published in 1553 by the Officina Dominica, a printing press run by the Dominicans in Paris. The initial edition consisted of two volumes, containing 355 woodcuts and descriptions of 728 notable individuals. Over the next several decades, the book underwent numerous revisions and expansions, with new editions appearing in 1563, 1580, and 1620. Each edition introduced additional images and biographical information, reflecting the ongoing interest in and expansion of the Promptuarium's scope.\n\nThe publication of the Promptuarium Iconum Insigniorum was not without controversy. The work was criticized by some for its perceived bias towards Catholic figures and its lack of representation of notable non-Catholics. Despite these criticisms, the book remained a popular and influential work throughout the 16th and 17th centuries.\n\n**Reception**\n\nThe Promptuarium Iconum Insigniorum was widely acclaimed for its innovative approach to iconography and biography. The book's success can be attributed to its comprehensive scope, which covered a wide range of historical figures and fields. The work's accessibility, made possible by the use of woodcuts, made it a valuable resource for scholars, students, and the general public.\n\nThe Promptuarium's influence extended beyond its own publication. It inspired a new generation of iconographers and biographers, who sought to create similar works that showcased the lives and achievements of notable individuals. The book's impact can be seen in the development of later iconographic and biographical publications, such as the \"Icones\" by André Thevet and the \"Vitae\" by Giorgio Vasari.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Guillaume Rouillé\n* Iconography\n* Biography\n* Woodcuts\n* Printing press\n* Dominican Order\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The Promptuarium Iconum Insigniorum is a significant work in the history of iconography and biography, showcasing the lives and achievements of notable individuals from ancient and modern times.\n* The book's innovative approach to iconography, using woodcuts to convey images, made it a valuable resource for scholars and the general public.\n* The Promptuarium's influence extended beyond its own publication, inspiring a new generation of iconographers and biographers.\n\n**References**\n\nThis article does not include any references as per the provided requirements.

Wikipedia articles have a recommended word count for each section, and I'll aim to provide a thorough and informative article within those guidelines.\n\n**Cyclone Batsirai**\n\nCyclone Batsirai was a powerful tropical cyclone that affected several countries in the southern Indian Ocean in 2022. The storm brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to the islands of Mauritius, Réunion, and Madagascar, causing significant damage and disruption.\n\n**Meteorological history**\n\nCyclone Batsirai formed on February 5, 2022, in the southern Indian Ocean, approximately 1,500 kilometers (932 miles) east of Madagascar. The system was initially classified as a tropical disturbance by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), but it quickly intensified into a tropical depression as it moved westward.\n\nOn February 7, the system intensified into a tropical storm, with maximum sustained winds of 65 km/h (40 mph). The storm continued to strengthen, reaching Category 2 intensity on February 9, with maximum sustained winds of 110 km/h (68 mph).\n\nAs the storm approached the Mascarene Islands, it began to interact with the subtropical high-pressure belt, causing it to slow down and begin a clockwise loop. This interaction also allowed the storm to intensify further, reaching Category 3 intensity on February 11, with maximum sustained winds of 155 km/h (96 mph).\n\n**Preparations**\n\n### Mauritius\n\nAs the storm approached Mauritius, the government issued a red alert, warning of strong winds, heavy rainfall, and potential flooding. Residents were advised to stay indoors and avoid traveling.\n\nThe authorities also took steps to evacuate areas prone to flooding, including low-lying coastal communities and rural areas.\n\n### Madagascar\n\nIn Madagascar, the government declared a state of emergency and issued a red alert for several regions, including the capital city, Antananarivo. The authorities also evacuated residents from coastal areas and established emergency shelters.\n\nThe International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) prepositioned emergency supplies, including food, water, and shelter materials, in anticipation of the storm's impact.\n\n**Impact**\n\n### Mauritius\n\nCyclone Batsirai made landfall on Mauritius on February 12, 2022, bringing heavy rainfall and strong winds. The storm caused widespread damage to infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and buildings.\n\nThe cyclone also disrupted communication services, with several phone and internet providers reporting outages. Power outages were also reported, affecting several thousand households.\n\n### Réunion\n\nAlthough Réunion was not directly hit by the storm, it experienced strong winds and heavy rainfall, causing some damage to buildings and infrastructure.\n\n### Madagascar\n\nIn Madagascar, the storm caused significant damage to infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and buildings. The cyclone also disrupted communication services, with several phone and internet providers reporting outages.\n\nThe storm also caused widespread flooding in several regions, including the capital city, Antananarivo. The flooding resulted in several fatalities and displaced thousands of people.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\n### Mauritius\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, the Mauritian government declared a state of emergency and launched a relief effort to assist affected communities. The government also established emergency shelters and provided food, water, and shelter materials to affected residents.\n\nThe IFRC also provided assistance, including emergency supplies and shelter materials, to affected communities.\n\n### Madagascar\n\nIn Madagascar, the government launched a relief effort to assist affected communities, including the provision of food, water, and shelter materials. The government also established emergency shelters and provided medical assistance to those affected.\n\nThe IFRC also provided assistance, including emergency supplies and shelter materials, to affected communities.\n\n**International response**\n\nThe international community responded quickly to the disaster, with several countries and organizations providing assistance to affected communities.\n\nThe European Union (EU) provided €1 million in emergency funding to assist affected communities, while the United States provided $500,000 in emergency funding.\n\nThe United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) also launched an appeal for funding to assist affected communities.\n\n**See also**\n\n* List of tropical cyclones\n* Cyclone seasons in the Indian Ocean\n* Mauritius\n* Réunion\n* Madagascar\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is based on publicly available information and has not been verified by the author.\n* The information provided is accurate to the best of the author's knowledge and is subject to change.\n\n**References**\n\nNone\n\n**External links**\n\n* Mauritius Meteorological Service\n* Madagascar Meteorological Service\n* IFRC Relief Efforts\n* OCHA Appeal for Funding", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.
