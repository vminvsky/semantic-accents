This iconic symbol is one of the most recognizable and revered Buddhist monuments in the world, representing the triumph of the Buddhist faith over other ideologies.\n\n**History**\n\nThe Lion Capital of Ashoka was erected in the 3rd century BCE, during the reign of the Indian emperor Ashoka, who ruled the Mauryan Empire from 269 to 232 BCE. Ashoka was a powerful and influential ruler who expanded his empire through conquest, but later converted to Buddhism and worked tirelessly to spread the teachings of the Buddha throughout his kingdom. The Lion Capital is believed to have been created to commemorate the establishment of Buddhism in India and to symbolize the power and influence of the faith.\n\nAshoka's conversion to Buddhism was a result of a pivotal event in his life, the Battle of Kalinga, fought in 261 BCE. The brutal and devastating battle resulted in the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives, including many civilians, and left deep scars on Ashoka's conscience. It was after this event that Ashoka began his journey towards Buddhism, later converting to the faith and becoming one of its most devoted followers.\n\n**Excavation and Display**\n\nThe Lion Capital of Ashoka was discovered in 1826 by the British archaeologist Alexander Cunningham, who was conducting an excavation in Sarnath. The capital was found in a state of disrepair, having been buried under the earth for centuries. The original pillar, which was over 15 meters tall, had been toppled over, and the capital had been broken into several pieces.\n\nIn 1956, the Indian government undertook a major restoration project to conserve and display the Lion Capital. The capital was carefully restored to its original shape, and the pillar was reconstructed using the original stones. Today, the Lion Capital stands atop a marble pedestal, surrounded by a decorative railing, in the Sarnath Archaeological Museum.\n\n**Description**\n\nThe Lion Capital of Ashoka is a magnificent stone sculpture that depicts a lion seated on a circular base, with four animals at the corners. The capital is carved from sandstone and stands over 2 meters tall. The lion is depicted with a gentle expression, symbolizing the power and majesty of the Buddhist faith.\n\nThe four animals at the corners of the base are believed to represent the four directions: the lion represents the east, the bull represents the south, the elephant represents the west, and the horse represents the north. The animals are depicted in a naturalistic style, showcasing the skill and craftsmanship of the ancient Indian artists.\n\n**Symbolism**\n\nThe Lion Capital of Ashoka is a powerful symbol of the Buddhist faith, representing the triumph of the faith over other ideologies. The lion, in particular, is a sacred animal in Buddhism, symbolizing courage, strength, and wisdom. The capital is also believed to represent the four noble truths of Buddhism: the truth of suffering, the truth of the origin of suffering, the truth of the cessation of suffering, and the truth of the path to the cessation of suffering.\n\nThe capital is also seen as a symbol of the growth and spread of Buddhism in India, representing the faith's ability to adapt and thrive in different cultures and societies. The Lion Capital has become an iconic symbol of Indian culture and has been reproduced and adapted in various forms, including coins, stamps, and other art forms.\n\n**Influences**\n\nThe Lion Capital of Ashoka has had a profound influence on Indian art and architecture, particularly in the development of the Gandhara style, which emerged in the 2nd century CE. The Gandhara style, which was a blend of Indian and Greek art forms, was characterized by the use of marble, intricate carvings, and the depiction of Buddhist deities in human form.\n\nThe Lion Capital has also inspired numerous adaptations and recreations in other parts of the world, including in Asia, Europe, and the Americas. The capital has been reproduced in various forms, including sculptures, paintings, and prints, and has become a popular motif in Buddhist art and architecture.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nThe Lion Capital of Ashoka is a testament to the enduring legacy of the Mauryan Empire and the spread of Buddhism in India. The capital has become an iconic symbol of Indian culture and has been recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1986.\n\nThe Lion Capital has also played a significant role in promoting cultural exchange and understanding between different societies. The capital has been celebrated in various forms of art and literature, including poems, songs, and stories, and has become a source of inspiration for artists and writers around the world.\n\n**Reconstructions**\n\nSeveral reconstructions of the Lion Capital of Ashoka have been undertaken over the years, including the 1956 restoration project. The original pillar was reconstructed using the original stones, and the capital was carefully restored to its original shape.\n\nIn 2013, a new reconstruction of the Lion Capital was undertaken as part of a major renovation project at the Sarnath Archaeological Museum. The new reconstruction featured a more accurate depiction of the capital, including the addition of intricate carvings and ornate details.\n\n**Related Sculpture**\n\nThe Lion Capital of Ashoka is part of a larger series of sculptures that were created during the Mauryan period. Other notable sculptures from this period include the Ashoka Pillar, which features a similar lion capital, and the Bodhi Tree, which is believed to be the sacred tree under which the Buddha attained enlightenment.\n\nThe Lion Capital is also part of a larger collection of Buddhist sculptures that were created during the Mauryan period. Other notable sculptures from this collection include the elephant capital, which features a majestic elephant seated on a circular base, and the bull capital, which features a powerful bull seated on a circular base.\n\n**Notes**\n\nThe Lion Capital of Ashoka is a magnificent stone sculpture that has become an iconic symbol of the Buddhist faith. The capital is a testament to the enduring legacy of the Mauryan Empire and the spread of Buddhism in India. The capital has been recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1986 and has become a source of inspiration for artists and writers around the world.\n\nThe Lion Capital is a powerful symbol of the Buddhist faith, representing the triumph of the faith over other ideologies. The capital is a must-see for anyone interested in Indian culture, art, and architecture, and is a testament to the enduring legacy of the Mauryan Empire.\n\n**References**\n\nNo references are available for this article.\n\n**Cited Works**\n\nNo cited works are available for this article.\n\n**Further Reading**\n\nFor further reading on the Lion Capital of Ashoka, see:\n\n* Alexander Cunningham, \"The Ancient Geography of India\" (1871)\n* John Marshall, \"A Guide to Sarnath\" (1918)\n* Percy Brown, \"Indian Architecture\" (1956)\n* George Michell, \"The Penguin Guide to the Monuments of India\" (1989)\n\n**External Links**\n\n* Sarnath Archaeological Museum\n* UNESCO World Heritage Site: Sarnath\n* Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH)\n* Archaeological Survey of India (ASI)", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The mission aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in altering the trajectory of a small asteroid by colliding with it.\n\n**Mission History**\n\nThe Double Asteroid Redirection Test mission has its roots in the Planetary Defense Coordination Office's (PDCO) efforts to develop and test asteroid deflection techniques. In 2015, NASA selected the DART mission as one of the two winners of the agency's Planetary Defense Grand Challenge, a competition aimed at identifying innovative and cost-effective solutions for asteroid deflection. The DART mission was designed to be a technological demonstration, with a focus on testing the feasibility of kinetic impact as a means of asteroid deflection.\n\n**Description**\n\nThe Double Asteroid Redirection Test mission involves a spacecraft, known as the Didymos Reconnaissance and Asteroid Camera for Optical, near-infrared, and submillimeter (DRACO) spacecraft, which was launched aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California. The spacecraft was designed to travel to the Didymos asteroid system, which consists of a primary asteroid (Didymos) and a smaller asteroid (Dimorphos). The mission's objective is to collide with Dimorphos and alter its trajectory.\n\n**Spacecraft**\n\nThe DRACO spacecraft is a small, cube-shaped satellite that measures approximately 2.5 meters on each side. The spacecraft is equipped with a range of instruments and systems, including:\n\n### Camera\n\nThe DRACO spacecraft is equipped with a high-resolution camera, known as the Asteroid Terrain Camera (ATC), which is designed to capture images of the Didymos asteroid system. The ATC camera has a resolution of 10 micrometers and is capable of capturing images of the asteroid's surface at a distance of up to 20 kilometers.\n\n### Solar arrays\n\nThe DRACO spacecraft is powered by a pair of solar arrays, which are designed to provide the spacecraft with the energy it needs to operate. The solar arrays are made up of thin, flexible panels that are capable of generating up to 500 watts of power.\n\n### Antenna\n\nThe DRACO spacecraft is equipped with a high-gain antenna, which is used for communication with Earth. The antenna is designed to transmit data back to Earth at a rate of up to 256 kilobits per second.\n\n### Ion thruster\n\nThe DRACO spacecraft is equipped with an ion thruster, which is used to propel the spacecraft through space. The ion thruster is a type of electric propulsion system that uses a stream of ions to generate thrust.\n\n**Secondary spacecraft**\n\nThe Double Asteroid Redirection Test mission also involves a secondary spacecraft, known as the Light Italian CubeSat for Imaging of Asteroids (LICIACube). LICIACube is a small, cube-shaped satellite that measures approximately 10 centimeters on each side. The spacecraft is equipped with a high-resolution camera and is designed to capture images of the Didymos asteroid system after the impact.\n\n**Effect of the impact on Dimorphos and Didymos**\n\nThe impact of the DRACO spacecraft on Dimorphos is expected to alter the asteroid's trajectory by a small amount, typically on the order of a few millimeters per second. The effect of the impact on Didymos is expected to be negligible, as the asteroid is much larger than Dimorphos.\n\n**Observations of the impact**\n\nThe impact of the DRACO spacecraft on Dimorphos is expected to be observed by a range of instruments, including the ATC camera on the DRACO spacecraft, the LICIACube spacecraft, and ground-based telescopes. The observations are expected to provide valuable insights into the dynamics of the impact and the resulting changes to the asteroid's trajectory.\n\n**Follow-up mission**\n\nThe Double Asteroid Redirection Test mission is expected to be followed up by a series of future missions, including the Hera mission, which is scheduled to launch in 2024. The Hera mission will involve a spacecraft that will travel to the Didymos asteroid system and conduct a detailed survey of the asteroid's surface and subsurface.\n\n**AIDA mission architecture**\n\nThe Double Asteroid Redirection Test mission is part of a larger program known as the Asteroid Impact and Deflection Assessment (AIDA) mission. The AIDA mission is a collaboration between NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) that aims to develop and test asteroid deflection techniques.\n\n**Mission Profile**\n\nThe Double Asteroid Redirection Test mission involves a complex sequence of operations, including launch, transit, and impact. The mission profile is as follows:\n\n### Target asteroid\n\nThe target asteroid for the Double Asteroid Redirection Test mission is the Dimorphos asteroid, which is a small asteroid that orbits the Didymos asteroid.\n\n### Preflight preparations\n\nThe DRACO spacecraft was launched on November 24, 2021, and traveled to the Didymos asteroid system. The spacecraft completed a series of tests and checks before entering into orbit around the asteroid.\n\n### Launch\n\nThe DRACO spacecraft was launched aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California.\n\n### Transit\n\nThe DRACO spacecraft traveled to the Didymos asteroid system, a journey that took approximately 10 months. The spacecraft completed a series of trajectory correction maneuvers to ensure it arrived at the asteroid on schedule.\n\n### Course of the impact\n\nThe impact of the DRACO spacecraft on Dimorphos is expected to occur on September 26, 2022. The impact will be observed by a range of instruments, including the ATC camera on the DRACO spacecraft, the LICIACube spacecraft, and ground-based telescopes.\n\n#### Sequence of operations for impact\n\nThe sequence of operations for the impact is as follows:\n\n1. The DRACO spacecraft will enter into orbit around Dimorphos.\n2. The spacecraft will conduct a series of checks to ensure it is in the correct position and attitude.\n3. The spacecraft will begin its final descent to the surface of Dimorphos.\n4. The spacecraft will impact the surface of Dimorphos at a speed of approximately 6.6 kilometers per second.\n5. The impact will be observed by a range of instruments, including the ATC camera on the DRACO spacecraft, the LICIACube spacecraft, and ground-based telescopes.\n\n**Gallery**\n\n* Image of the DRACO spacecraft\n* Image of the Didymos asteroid system\n* Image of the LICIACube spacecraft\n* Image of the impact site on Dimorphos\n\n**See also**\n\n* Asteroid deflection\n* Planetary defense\n* Space mission\n* Asteroid\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The Double Asteroid Redirection Test mission is a technological demonstration, with a focus on testing the feasibility of kinetic impact as a means of asteroid deflection.\n* The mission is part of a larger program known as the Asteroid Impact and Deflection Assessment (AIDA) mission.\n* The mission involves a complex sequence of operations, including launch, transit, and impact.\n\n**References**\n\n* NASA.

He was a military leader, statesman, and politician who played a pivotal role in the development of the United States, particularly in the early 19th century. Jackson was a complex figure, known for his strong personality, his advocacy for the common man, and his commitment to states' rights. This article will explore his life, from his early years to his presidency and legacy.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nAndrew Jackson was born in the Waxhaws region, on the border of North and South Carolina, to Andrew and Elizabeth Jackson. He was the third of three children, and his father was a Scottish-Irish immigrant who had settled in the area. Jackson's early life was marked by hardship and loss; his father died when he was just 14, and his family struggled to make ends meet. Despite these challenges, Jackson received a good education, attending the local school and later studying law in Salisbury, North Carolina.\n\n**Revolutionary War**\n\nJackson's involvement in the Revolutionary War began at the age of 13, when he joined the local militia to fight against the British. He served as a courier and later as a staff officer, distinguishing himself in several battles, including the Battle of Hanging Rock. In 1781, Jackson was captured by the British and held as a prisoner of war for several months. After his release, he returned to his family's farm, where he continued to study law and prepare for a career in politics.\n\n**Early Career**\n\n### **Legal Career and Marriage**\n\nJackson's law career began in 1787, when he was admitted to the bar in Salisbury, North Carolina. He quickly established a successful practice, specializing in property law and litigation. In 1788, Jackson married Rachel Donelson Robards, a widow with two children. The marriage was a happy one, and Jackson's love for Rachel was a defining feature of his life.\n\n### **Early Public Career**\n\nJackson's entry into politics began in 1791, when he was elected as a representative to the Tennessee State Legislature. He quickly distinguished himself as a strong advocate for the common man, and his popularity grew. In 1796, Jackson was elected as a senator to the U.S. Senate, where he served for four years.\n\n### **Planting Career and Slavery**\n\nIn 1798, Jackson invested in a plantation in Tennessee, which he called the Hermitage. The plantation was a successful agricultural enterprise, and Jackson became a wealthy man. However, his involvement in the slave trade was also a defining feature of his life. Jackson owned over 150 slaves, and his commitment to the institution of slavery was a source of controversy throughout his life.\n\n### **Duel with Dickinson and Adventure with Burr**\n\nIn 1806, Jackson engaged in a famous duel with Charles Dickinson, a Kentucky lawyer. The duel was sparked by a disagreement over a horse, and Jackson was severely wounded. He recovered from his injuries, but the duel left a lasting impact on his reputation. In 1807, Jackson joined Alexander Hamilton's friend and rival, Aaron Burr, on a military expedition to the Louisiana Territory. The expedition was a disaster, and Jackson was forced to return to Tennessee.\n\n**Military Career**\n\n### **War of 1812**\n\nJackson's military career began in 1812, when he was appointed as a brigadier general in the Tennessee militia. He played a key role in the War of 1812, leading a successful campaign against the Creek Indians in what is now Alabama and Georgia. Jackson's victory at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend was a decisive turning point in the war, and he was hailed as a hero.\n\n### **Creek War**\n\nJackson's involvement in the Creek War began in 1813, when he was appointed as the commander of the Tennessee militia. He led a successful campaign against the Creek Indians, defeating them at the Battle of Talladega. Jackson's victory was a key factor in the signing of the Treaty of Fort Jackson, which ceded large tracts of land to the United States.\n\n### **Battle of New Orleans**\n\nIn 1815, Jackson led a successful defense of New Orleans against a British invasion. The battle was a decisive victory for Jackson, and it cemented his reputation as a military leader. Jackson's victory at New Orleans was a key factor in the end of the War of 1812, and he was hailed as a hero.\n\n### **First Seminole War**\n\nJackson's involvement in the First Seminole War began in 1814, when he was appointed as the commander of the U.S. forces in Florida. He led a successful campaign against the Seminole Indians, defeating them at the Battle of Apalachicola. Jackson's victory was a key factor in the signing of the Treaty of Fort Jackson, which ceded large tracts of land to the United States.\n\n**Presidential Aspirations**\n\n### **Election of 1824**\n\nJackson's presidential aspirations began in 1824, when he was a leading candidate for the presidency. He ran as a Democratic-Republican, and his campaign focused on the issues of states' rights and limited government. Jackson's campaign was marked by controversy, particularly over his role in the War of 1812. He lost the election to John Quincy Adams, but his popularity continued to grow.\n\n### **Election of 1828 and Death of Rachel Jackson**\n\nIn 1828, Jackson ran for the presidency again, and his campaign was marked by controversy. His opponent, John Quincy Adams, was a member of the Federalist Party, and Jackson's campaign focused on the issues of states' rights and limited government. Jackson's wife, Rachel, died in 1828, and his campaign was marked by sadness and grief. Jackson won the election, but his victory was marred by controversy.\n\n**Presidency (1829–1837)**\n\n### **Inauguration**\n\nJackson's inauguration as president was a significant event, marking the beginning of a new era in American politics. He took office on March 4, 1829, and his inauguration was attended by thousands of people. Jackson's inaugural address was a call to action, emphasizing the importance of states' rights and limited government.\n\n### **Reforms and Rotation in Office**\n\nJackson's presidency was marked by significant reforms, including the removal of government officials and the reduction of the size of the federal government. He also implemented a policy of rotation in office, which required government officials to serve for a limited time before being replaced. Jackson's reforms were designed to reduce corruption and increase accountability in government.\n\n### **Petticoat Affair**\n\nIn 1831, Jackson became embroiled in the Petticoat Affair, a scandal involving a woman named Peggy Eaton. Eaton was a member of Jackson's cabinet, and her relationship with Jackson was the subject of controversy. The scandal led to the resignation of several members of Jackson's cabinet, and it damaged his reputation.\n\n### **Indian Removal Act**\n\nIn 1830, Jackson signed the Indian Removal Act, which authorized the forced removal of Native American tribes from their lands to Indian Territory. The act was a significant step in the Indian Removal policy, which was designed to provide land for white settlers and to relocate Native American tribes. Jackson's support for the Indian Removal Act was a key factor in the Trail of Tears, a brutal and devastating event that led to the deaths of thousands of Native Americans.\n\n### **Nullification Crisis**\n\nIn 1832, South Carolina passed a nullification ordinance, which declared the tariffs of 1828 and 1832 to be unconstitutional. Jackson's response was to issue a proclamation, which declared the nullification ordinance to be unconstitutional and threatened to use military force to enforce federal law. The crisis was resolved through negotiations, but it highlighted the deep divisions between the North and South.\n\n### **Bank War and Election of 1832**\n\nIn 1832, Jackson's veto of a bill to re-charter the Second Bank of the United States led to a bitter dispute with the Whig Party. The Bank War, as it came to be known, was a significant event in American politics, and it marked the beginning of the party system. Jackson's victory in the election of 1832 was a significant event, marking the beginning of a new era in American politics.\n\n### **Bank Veto**\n\nJackson's veto of the bill to re-charter the Second Bank of the United States was a significant event, marking the beginning of the Bank War.

He won the election with a significant margin, and his victory marked the beginning of the Democratic Party as a major force in American politics.\n\n### **Removal of Deposits and Censure**\n\nIn 1833, Jackson removed government deposits from the Second Bank of the United States and deposited them in state banks. The move was a significant step in the development of the party system, and it marked a significant shift in American politics.\n\n### **Panic of 1837**\n\nThe Panic of 1837, which occurred in 1837, was a significant economic downturn that marked the end of the Jacksonian era. The panic was caused by a combination of factors, including the removal of government deposits from the Second Bank of the United States and the speculation in land and other commodities.\n\n### **Physical Assault and Assassination Attempt**\n\nIn 1835, Jackson was the victim of a physical assault, which left him with a severe headache and a wounded arm. The assault was a significant event, and it highlighted the deep divisions between the North and South.\n\n### **Slavery**\n\nJackson's views on slavery were complex and multifaceted. He owned slaves throughout his life, but he also believed that slavery was a necessary evil. Jackson's support for the Indian Removal Act and the Trail of Tears was a key factor in the deepening of the slavery crisis.\n\n### **Foreign Affairs**\n\nJackson's foreign policy was marked by a number of significant events, including the signing of the Webster-Ashburton Treaty, which established a border between the United States and Canada. Jackson's foreign policy was also marked by a number of controversies, including the Nullification Crisis and the Bank War.\n\n### **Judiciary**\n\nJackson's views on the judiciary were complex and multifaceted. He believed in a strict construction of the Constitution, which meant that the judiciary had a limited role to play in interpreting the law. Jackson's views on the judiciary were also influenced by his support for states' rights and limited government.\n\n### **States Admitted to the Union**\n\nDuring Jackson's presidency, a number of new states were admitted to the Union, including Michigan, Arkansas, and Florida. The admission of new states was a significant event, marking the growth and development of the United States.\n\n**Later Life and Death (1837–1845)**\n\nAfter leaving office, Jackson returned to the Hermitage, where he lived a quiet and private life. He died on June 8, 1845, at the age of 78, and was buried on the Hermitage grounds.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\n### **Family**\n\nJackson's family was a significant part of his life, and he was devoted to his wife, Rachel, and their children.

Founded in 1826, UCL is one of the oldest and largest universities in the UK. It is a member of the prestigious Russell Group, a network of research-intensive universities in the UK and Ireland. UCL is known for its academic excellence, research innovation, and global connections, making it a world-leading institution in higher education.\n\nHistory\n\n### 1826 to 1836 – London University\n\nThe story of UCL begins in 1826, when a group of British intellectuals, including the philosopher Jeremy Bentham and the mathematician Augustus De Morgan, came together to establish a new institution of higher learning in London. They were motivated by a desire to provide a more progressive and inclusive education, one that would be open to students from all backgrounds and not just the wealthy elite. The institution, initially called the University of London, held its first classes in 1828 in a rented building in Gower Street, Bloomsbury.\n\n### 1836 to 1900 – University College, London\n\nIn 1836, the University of London was formally established, with University College, London (UCL) as its constituent college. UCL quickly established itself as a center of learning and intellectual inquiry, attracting students and faculty from across the UK and beyond. During this period, UCL played a significant role in the development of modern science, mathematics, and social sciences. The college also expanded its facilities, including the construction of a new library and the establishment of the UCL Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology.\n\n### 1900 to 1976 – University of London, University College\n\nIn 1900, the University of London and University College, London, merged to form the University of London, University College. This marked a significant turning point in the history of UCL, as it became a major center of learning and research in the UK.

The outbreak was first identified in May 2022 and spread to multiple countries around the world, with a significant increase in cases reported in the summer of 2022.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Emergency Preparedness Prior to Outbreak\n\nPrior to the outbreak, several countries had established emergency preparedness plans for monkeypox, which had been identified as a potential public health threat. These plans included strategies for case identification, contact tracing, and outbreak management. However, the rapid spread of the virus and the emergence of new cases in non-endemic countries led to a significant increase in the public health response.\n\n### Endemic Mpox in Africa\n\nMonkeypox has been endemic in certain parts of Africa for decades, with cases reported in countries such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Republic of the Congo, and Nigeria. The virus is typically transmitted to humans through contact with infected animals, such as rodents and primates, and can also be spread through human-to-human contact.\n\n**Outbreak Characteristics**\n\n### Phylogenetics\n\nThe 2022–2023 mpox outbreak was caused by a distinct strain of the monkeypox virus, which was identified as a member of the West African clade. This strain was distinct from the strains found in Africa, where monkeypox is endemic. The phylogenetic analysis of the virus suggested that the outbreak strain was likely introduced to non-endemic countries through international travel.\n\n### Long Incubation Periods\n\nThe incubation period of the virus, which is the time between infection and the onset of symptoms, was typically long, ranging from 5-21 days. This made it challenging for public health authorities to identify and contain cases, as individuals may not have been aware of their exposure until symptoms had already developed.\n\n### Mild Clinical Manifestations\n\nThe symptoms of the virus were typically mild, including fever, headache, and muscle aches. In some cases, individuals may have experienced more severe symptoms, such as rash, swollen lymph nodes, and respiratory distress. However, the majority of cases were reported as mild, with individuals often experiencing only a few symptoms.\n\n### Fear of Zoonotic Spread\n\nThere was a significant concern among public health authorities that the virus could be transmitted from animals to humans, particularly through contact with infected rodents and primates. This fear led to a rapid response to identify and contain cases, as well as to implement measures to prevent animal-to-human transmission.\n\n**Chronology**\n\n### Deaths Outside of Africa\n\nThe first reported death outside of Africa occurred on August 2, 2022, in a 41-year-old man in Spain. This was followed by several other reported deaths in non-endemic countries, including the United States, Brazil, and the United Kingdom.\n\n**Transmission**\n\n### Transmission Patterns\n\nThe transmission of the virus was primarily through human-to-human contact, with cases reported among individuals who had been in close proximity to each other. This included cases among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBM), as well as cases among individuals who had been in close contact with those individuals.\n\n### Wastewater Surveillance\n\nSeveral countries implemented wastewater surveillance programs to detect the presence of the virus in wastewater samples. This allowed public health authorities to identify potential hotspots and to take measures to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\n**Interventions**\n\n### Testing and Containment\n\nPublic health authorities implemented extensive testing and containment measures to identify and isolate cases. This included contact tracing, quarantine, and isolation protocols, as well as testing of individuals who had been in close contact with cases.\n\n### Vaccination\n\nSeveral countries implemented vaccination programs to prevent the spread of the virus. This included the use of the JYNNEOS vaccine, which was approved for emergency use in several countries.\n\n**Social Aspects**\n\n### Misinformation\n\nThere was significant misinformation circulating online about the virus, including claims that it was spread through mosquito bites, that it was highly contagious, and that it was transmitted through casual contact. Public health authorities worked to address these concerns and to provide accurate information to the public.\n\n**Responses**\n\n### World Health Organization\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) on July 23, 2022. This led to a significant increase in the global response to the outbreak, including the mobilization of resources and the implementation of emergency measures.\n\n### Countries\n\nSeveral countries, including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia, implemented emergency measures to respond to the outbreak. This included the establishment of emergency response teams, the implementation of testing and containment protocols, and the provision of public health guidance to the public.\n\n### Dependent Territories\n\nSeveral dependent territories, including Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands, reported cases of the virus. Public health authorities in these territories implemented emergency measures to respond to the outbreak.\n\n**Cases per Country and Territory**\n\nThe following table provides a summary of the reported cases of the virus by country and territory:\n\n| Country/Territory | First Confirmed Case | Total Cases | Deaths |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Argentina |  |  |  |\n| Australia |  |  |

He is widely regarded as one of the greatest mathematicians of all time, and his work has had a profound impact on the development of mathematics and science.\n\n**Youth and Education**\n\nCarl Friedrich Gauss was born on April 30, 1777, in Braunschweig, Germany, to a family of modest means. His father, Gebhard Dietrich Gauss, was a gardener and a musician, and his mother, Dorothea Benze, was a homemaker. Gauss's early education took place at home, where he demonstrated exceptional mathematical abilities from a young age. In 1787, he began attending the local school, where he excelled in mathematics and was particularly drawn to the study of geometry.\n\nIn 1792, Gauss moved to the Collegium Carolinum in Brunswick, where he studied mathematics, physics, and philosophy. During this period, he developed a strong interest in mathematics and began to explore the works of famous mathematicians, including Leonhard Euler and Joseph-Louis Lagrange. In 1795, Gauss completed his studies at the Collegium Carolinum and began to focus on his own mathematical research.\n\n**Private Scholar**\n\nGauss's private scholarship was marked by intense productivity and innovation. He worked tirelessly on his mathematical projects, often for 20 hours a day, and made significant contributions to various fields, including number theory, algebra, and geometry. During this period, he developed his famous \"two-square theorem,\" which states that a number can be represented as the sum of two squares if and only if it is not of the form 4^k(8m+7) for integers k and m.\n\nGauss's private scholarship also led to the development of his \"Disquisitiones Arithmeticae,\" a comprehensive treatise on number theory that was published in 1801. The book is considered one of the most important works in the field of number theory and has had a profound impact on the development of mathematics.\n\n**Professor in Göttingen**\n\nIn 1807, Gauss accepted a position as a professor of mathematics and astronomy at the University of Göttingen, where he taught for the next 18 years. During this period, he continued to work on his mathematical projects and made significant contributions to various fields, including differential geometry and non-Euclidean geometry.\n\nGauss's time at Göttingen was marked by intense productivity and innovation.

It was founded in 1994 as the Liga Indonesia Premier Division, and has undergone several name changes, government interventions, and suspensions.\n\nHistory\n\n**Origins**\n\nIndonesian football has a long history, dating back to the early 20th century when the country was still a Dutch colony. The first Indonesian football league was established in 1930, but it was not until after Indonesia gained independence in 1945 that the sport gained popularity. In the 1960s and 1970s, Indonesian football experienced a golden era, with the national team qualifying for the 1962 FIFA World Cup and winning several regional tournaments.\n\n**Foundation**\n\nThe modern Liga 1 was founded in 1994 as the Liga Indonesia Premier Division, with the aim of creating a more organized and competitive league structure. The league was initially contested by 12 clubs, with the top three teams earning promotion to the new division. However, the league struggled to gain traction, and by the late 1990s, it had been suspended several times due to financial difficulties and corruption.\n\n**Dualism**\n\nIn the early 2000s, the Liga Indonesia Premier Division was revived, but it was plagued by a dualism between the old and new leagues. The old league, known as the Liga Indonesia, continued to operate alongside the new league, creating confusion and uncertainty. This dualism lasted for several years, with both leagues competing for the same title and resources.\n\n**Government intervention and FIFA suspension**\n\nIn 2003, the Indonesian government intervened in the league, taking control of the Liga Indonesia Premier Division and imposing a new governing structure. However, this move was met with opposition from several clubs, who felt that the government was interfering with the sport. The conflict led to a suspension of the league by FIFA in 2005, which lasted for several years.\n\n**Name change**\n\nIn 2013, the league was renamed to Liga 1, in an effort to rebrand and reposition the sport. The name change was accompanied by a new logo and branding, as well as a revised competition format.\n\nCompetition format\n\n**Competition**\n\nLiga 1 is contested by 18 clubs, who compete in a double-round robin format. The season typically runs from April to December, with each club playing 34 matches. The top team earns promotion to the 2023-24 season and qualify for the AFC Champions League, while the bottom team is relegated to the Liga 2.\n\n**Promotion and relegation**\n\nThe league uses a promotion and relegation system, with the top team earning promotion to the Liga 1 and the bottom team being relegated to the Liga 2. The top two teams in the Liga 2 also earn promotion to the Liga 1.\n\n**Video assistant referee**\n\nIn 2019, Liga 1 introduced video assistant referee (VAR) technology, to improve the accuracy and consistency of refereeing decisions.\n\nClubs\n\n**Champions**\n\nThe following teams have won the Liga 1 title:\n\n* Persib Bandung (6 titles)\n* Persija Jakarta (5 titles)\n* Persebaya Surabaya (4 titles)\n* PSM Makassar (3 titles)\n* Persipura Jayapura (2 titles)\n\n**Performance by clubs**\n\nThe following table shows the performance of each club in the Liga 1 since its inception:\n\n| Club | Titles | Promotion/Relegation |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Persib Bandung | 6 | 12/2 |\n| Persija Jakarta | 5 | 12/3 |\n| Persebaya Surabaya | 4 | 10/4 |\n| PSM Makassar | 3 | 8/5 |\n| Persipura Jayapura | 2 | 6/6 |\n\n**2024-25 season**\n\nThe 2024-25 season is scheduled to start in April 2024, with 18 clubs competing in the Liga 1.\n\nMaps\n\nThe following map shows the location of each club in the Liga 1:\n\n[Insert map]\n\nFormer clubs\n\nThe following clubs have been relegated from the Liga 1 since its inception:\n\n* Persela Lamongan\n* PS TNI\n* PS Barito Putera\n* PSS Sleman\n\nAll-time Liga 1 table\n\nThe following table shows the all-time performance of each club in the Liga 1:\n\n| Club | Titles | Promotion/Relegation | Points |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Persib Bandung | 6 | 12/2 | 354 |\n| Persija Jakarta | 5 | 12/3 | 332 |\n| Persebaya Surabaya | 4 | 10/4 | 306 |\n| PSM Makassar | 3 | 8/5 | 284 |\n| Persipura Jayapura | 2 | 6/6 | 254 |\n\nForeign players\n\nThe following foreign players have played in the Liga 1:\n\n* Goran Stevanović (Serbia)\n* Rudi Kroll (Australia)\n* Sandro Barreto (Brazil)\n* Marcio Barbieri (Brazil)\n* Richard Gadze (Ghana)\n* Egy Maulana Vikri (Indonesia)\n* Yoo Hyun-goo (South Korea)\n\nAwards\n\n**Top scorers**\n\nThe following players have topped the scoring chart in the Liga 1:\n\n* 2013: Bambang Pamungkas (Persija Jakarta)\n* 2014: Bambang Pamungkas (Persija Jakarta)\n* 2015: Boaz Solossa (Persipura Jayapura)\n* 2016: Boaz Solossa (Persipura Jayapura)\n* 2017: Bruno Lopes (Pahang)\n* 2018: Bambang Pamungkas (Persija Jakarta)\n* 2019: Yoo Hyun-goo (Persija Jakarta)\n* 2020: Beto Gonçalves (Persija Jakarta)\n* 2021: Ilija Spasojević (PSS Sleman)\n* 2022: Beto Gonçalves (Persija Jakarta)\n\n**Best players**\n\nThe following players have been named as the best players in the Liga 1:\n\n* 2013: Bambang Pamungkas (Persija Jakarta)\n* 2014: Bambang Pamungkas (Persija Jakarta)\n* 2015: Boaz Solossa (Persipura Jayapura)\n* 2016: Boaz Solossa (Persipura Jayapura)\n* 2017: Bruno Lopes (Pahang)\n* 2018: Bambang Pamungkas (Persija Jakarta)\n* 2019: Yoo Hyun-goo (Persija Jakarta)\n* 2020: Beto Gonçalves (Persija Jakarta)\n* 2021: Ilija Spasojević (PSS Sleman)\n* 2022: Beto Gonçalves (Persija Jakarta)\n\n**Best coaches**\n\nThe following coaches have been named as the best coaches in the Liga 1:\n\n* 2013: Djadjang Nurdjaman (Persib Bandung)\n* 2014: Djadjang Nurdjaman (Persib Bandung)\n* 2015: Slamat Ramli (Persipura Jayapura)\n* 2016: Slamat Ramli (Persipura Jayapura)\n* 2017: E.

Robert Oppenheimer, the director of the Manhattan Project. The film stars Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer, Emily Blunt as Kitty Oppenheimer, and Matt Damon as Leslie Groves.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film begins with Oppenheimer's early life, growing up in a wealthy family and showing a keen interest in science and mathematics. He attends Harvard University, where he becomes fascinated with the works of Albert Einstein and Bertrand Russell. After graduating, Oppenheimer moves to Cambridge University, where he meets his future wife, Kitty.\n\nThe film then follows Oppenheimer's involvement in the Manhattan Project, a secret research and development project that aimed to create the world's first atomic bomb. Oppenheimer is appointed as the director of the project, tasked with leading a team of scientists and engineers to develop the bomb.\n\nAs the project progresses, Oppenheimer's relationships with his team members become increasingly strained. He struggles with the moral implications of creating a bomb that could kill millions of people, while also dealing with the pressure of meeting the project's deadline.\n\nThe film also explores Oppenheimer's personal life, including his relationships with his wife Kitty and his mistress Jean Tatlock. Oppenheimer's struggles with addiction and his declining health are also depicted in the film.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Cillian Murphy as J.

Sherwin. He also consulted with physicists and historians to gain a deeper understanding of the Manhattan Project and its significance.\n\n#### Writing\n\nNolan wrote the screenplay for \"Oppenheimer\" over a period of several years.

The case has garnered significant attention and controversy, with far-reaching implications for the former President of the United States and the broader American public.\n\nBackground\n----------\n\nThe case stems from a series of events beginning in 2022, when the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) discovered that Trump had taken classified documents with him to Mar-a-Lago upon leaving office in January 2021. An investigation ensued, led by the FBI and the DOJ, which culminated in the execution of a search warrant at Mar-a-Lago on August 8, 2022.\n\nIndictments and Arraignments\n-------------------------\n\n### Original Indictment\n\nOn June 8, 2023, a grand jury in the Southern District of Florida returned a 37-count indictment against Donald Trump, alleging that he willfully retained and stored national defense information without authorization, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 793(e).\n\n### Superseding Indictment\n\nOn September 22, 2023, a superseding indictment was returned, adding additional charges relating to obstruction of justice and conspiracy to obstruct justice.\n\n### Assignment of District Judge\n\nOn October 11, 2023, the case was assigned to District Judge Aileen M. Cannon, a Trump appointee to the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida.\n\n### Arraignments\n\n#### Trump\n\nOn November 29, 2023, Donald Trump was arraigned on the superseding indictment, entering a plea of not guilty to all charges.\n\n#### Nauta\n\nOn December 6, 2023, Walt Nauta, a former Trump employee, was arraigned on a one-count indictment alleging that he conspired with Trump to obstruct the investigation into the mishandling of classified documents.\n\n#### De Oliveira\n\nOn January 10, 2024, Carlos De Oliveira, a former Trump employee, was arraigned on a one-count indictment alleging that he conspired with Trump to obstruct the investigation into the mishandling of classified documents.\n\nPretrial Proceedings\n---------------------\n\n### 2023\n\nThroughout 2023, the case proceeded with pretrial motions and hearings. On September 22, 2023, Trump's lawyers filed a motion to dismiss the superseding indictment, which was denied by the court.\n\n### 2024\n\nIn 2024, the case continued to move forward, with pretrial motions and hearings scheduled throughout the year. On January 10, 2024, Trump's lawyers filed a motion to indefinitely delay the trial, citing the complexities of the case and the need for additional time to prepare.\n\nTrump's Request to Indefinitely Delay Trial\n------------------------------------------\n\nOn January 10, 2024, Trump's lawyers filed a motion to indefinitely delay the trial, citing the complexities of the case and the need for additional time to prepare. The motion was met with opposition from the prosecution, which argued that the delay would prejudice their case and potentially harm the public interest.\n\nDismissal and Appeal\n---------------------\n\nOn March 20, 2024, Judge Aileen M. Cannon granted Trump's motion to dismiss the superseding indictment, ruling that the prosecution had failed to establish a prima facie case. The prosecution immediately filed an appeal, arguing that the dismissal was premature and that the evidence presented was sufficient to support the charges.\n\nResponse\n--------\n\n### To Indictment\n\n#### Trump\n\nDonald Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing, stating that the indictment is a \"witch hunt\" and a \"disgrace\" to the American justice system.\n\n#### Other Republicans\n\nMany Republican lawmakers and politicians have come to Trump's defense, arguing that the indictment is a partisan attack and an abuse of power.\n\n#### Democrats\n\nDemocrats, on the other hand, have largely supported the prosecution, arguing that the evidence presented is sufficient to support the charges and that Trump must be held accountable for his actions.\n\n### To Dismissal\n\nThe dismissal of the superseding indictment has been met with mixed reactions. Some have argued that the decision was correct, given the complexities of the case and the need for additional time to prepare. Others have criticized the decision, arguing that it was premature and that the evidence presented was sufficient to support the charges.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Donald Trump\n* Mar-a-Lago\n* National Archives and Records Administration\n* United States Department of Justice\n* Classified documents\n* Obstruction of justice\n* Conspiracy to obstruct justice\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nExternal links\n--------------\n\n* Official website of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

This concept has gained significant attention in recent years, particularly among gamers and developers. Open-source video games offer a unique combination of creative freedom, community engagement, and collaborative development, making them an attractive option for those seeking a more interactive and participatory gaming experience.\n\n**Definition and Differentiation**\n\nOpen-source video games are often confused with free-to-play (F2P) or freemium games, which are games that are offered for free but generate revenue through microtransactions or advertising. However, the key distinction between open-source and F2P games lies in their business model and licensing. While F2P games are typically owned and controlled by a single entity, open-source games are open to modification and distribution by anyone, including their user base. This collaborative approach allows for a more fluid and dynamic development process, as changes and updates can be made by anyone, rather than relying on a single developer or publisher.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe concept of open-source video games is not new, dating back to the early days of video game development. However, it wasn't until the rise of digital distribution platforms and the increasing availability of game development tools that open-source gaming started to gain momentum. The open-source movement, which originated in the software industry, emphasizes collaboration, transparency, and community involvement. These principles are particularly well-suited to the video game industry, where creativity, experimentation, and community engagement are essential components of the gaming experience.\n\n**History**\n\n### Beginnings and Early Games\n\nThe first open-source video games were developed in the 1980s and 1990s by enthusiasts and hobbyists. These early games were often simple, 2D affairs, but they laid the groundwork for the more complex and sophisticated open-source games that followed. One notable example from this era is the game \"Wolfenstein 3D,\" which was released in 1992 and was one of the first 3D games to use open-source software.\n\n### 3D Games and Source Releases\n\nThe late 1990s and early 2000s saw a significant increase in the popularity of open-source video games, particularly 3D titles. This was largely due to the rise of digital distribution platforms like SourceForge and the availability of game development tools like the Source SDK. Games like \"Quake\" and \"Doom\" were among the first to be released with open-source code, allowing developers to modify and extend the game's functionality.\n\n### Rise in Popularity and Diversity\n\nThe mid-2000s saw a significant surge in the popularity of open-source video games, driven in part by the success of games like \"Braid\" and \"World of Goo.\" These games, developed by independent studios, demonstrated the potential for open-source games to achieve commercial success and critical acclaim. The rise of digital distribution platforms like Steam and the GOG.com store further facilitated the growth of the open-source gaming community.\n\n### Greater Organization\n\nAs the open-source gaming community grew, so did the need for greater organization and coordination. In response, several initiatives emerged to promote collaboration and knowledge-sharing among developers. The Open Game Art project, launched in 2010, aimed to provide a centralized repository for open-source game assets, while the Open Game Network (OGN) established a community-driven platform for game developers.\n\n### Hubs and Development Teams\n\nToday, open-source video games can be found in a wide range of genres and styles, from action-adventure games to role-playing games (RPGs) and sports simulations. Many open-source games are developed by community-driven teams, with contributors from around the world contributing to the game's development. Hubs like GitHub and Gamasutra provide a platform for developers to showcase their projects and collaborate with others.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Open-source software\n* Game development\n* Independent video games\n* Free-to-play games\n\n**References**\n\n(Note: This article does not include any citations or references, as per the requirements.)\n\n**External links**\n\n* The Open Game Art project\n* The Open Game Network (OGN)\n* GitHub\n* Gamasutra\n* SourceForge\n* Steam\n* GOG.com", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The storm caused significant impacts in the Caribbean and southeastern United States.\n\n# Meteorological History\nTropical Storm Alex developed from a tropical wave that emerged off the coast of Africa on June 1, 2022. The wave moved westward across the Atlantic, slowly organizing into a tropical cyclone. On June 6, the system strengthened into a tropical storm, with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (65 km/h). The storm continued to strengthen, with its maximum sustained winds reaching 50 mph (85 km/h) by June 8.\n\n# Preparations and Impact\n## Cuba\nAs Tropical Storm Alex approached Cuba, the Cuban government issued a tropical storm warning for the island's eastern provinces. Residents were advised to take precautions against strong winds and heavy rainfall. The storm made landfall in eastern Cuba on June 9, bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall to the region.\n\n## Florida\nAs Tropical Storm Alex moved northwestward, it brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to parts of Florida. A tropical storm warning was issued for the Florida Keys, with residents advised to take precautions against storm surge and flooding. The storm made landfall in southern Florida on June 10, causing widespread power outages and property damage.\n\n## The Bahamas\nTropical Storm Alex also brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to the Bahamas, with a tropical storm warning issued for the northern islands. Residents were advised to take precautions against storm surge and flooding, with some areas experiencing significant damage and disruption.\n\n# See Also\nFor more information on tropical storms and hurricanes in the North Atlantic, see the list of North Atlantic hurricanes and the list of tropical cyclones.\n\n# External Links\nFor more information on Tropical Storm Alex, see the National Hurricane Center's advisory archive.\n\nPlease note that I can provide a more detailed article on Tropical Storm Alex if you would like, but it would still be a significantly shorter article than 4096 words.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The election was called by Prime Minister Mario Draghi, who had been leading a national unity government since February 2021, in an effort to break the political stalemate and provide a new direction for the country.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe 2022 Italian general election was the 19th election since the end of World War II and the 10th since the introduction of the current electoral law in 1993. The election was marked by a complex and fragmented political landscape, with several parties and coalitions competing for power. The main contenders were the center-left Democratic Party (PD), the center-right Brothers of Italy (FdI), the Five Star Movement (M5S), and the League (Lega).\n\n**Electoral campaign**\n\nThe electoral campaign was marked by a series of high-profile events and debates.

The debates were marked by heated exchanges and disagreements between the party leaders.\n\n**Electoral system**\n\nThe Italian electoral system is a mixed-member proportional representation system, which combines elements of proportional representation and first-past-the-post voting. The country is divided into 600 electoral constituencies, each electing one deputy. The remaining deputies are elected through a national list system, with each region electing a number of deputies proportional to its population.\n\n**Electoral lists**\n\nThe following lists were presented in the 2022 Italian general election:\n\n### Lists with parliamentary representation\n\n* Democratic Party (PD)\n* Brothers of Italy (FdI)\n* Five Star Movement (M5S)\n* League (Lega)\n* Forza Italia (FI)\n* Civic Commitment (C!)\n* Italia Viva (IV)\n* Green Europe (EV)\n* Left Ecology Freedom (SEL)\n\n### Lists without parliamentary representation\n\n* Action (Az)\n* Common Good (CB)\n* Europeanist Party (PE)\n* National Movement (MN)\n* Pact for Italy (IpF)\n* People's Union (UP)\n* Red MoVimento (RM)\n\n### Lists running only in overseas constituencies\n\n* Forward Italy (Vi)\n* Italian Republican Party (PRI)\n\n**Opinion polls**\n\nThe opinion polls conducted in the run-up to the election suggested a close contest between the main parties.

The Minions, led by Kevin (voiced by Pierre Coffin), Stuart (voiced by Pierre Coffin), and Bob (voiced by Pierre Coffin), are a group of yellow, cylindrical creatures who are obsessed with bananas and have a tendency to cause chaos wherever they go. Gru and the Minions form an unlikely partnership, with Gru using the Minions to help him achieve his goal of joining the Vicious 6.\n\nHowever, Gru soon discovers that joining the Vicious 6 is not as easy as he thought, and he must use his wits and cunning to outsmart the group's leader, Wild Knuckles.
