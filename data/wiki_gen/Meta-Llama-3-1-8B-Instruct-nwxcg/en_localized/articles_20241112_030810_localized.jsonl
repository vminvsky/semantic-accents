It emerged in the 1970s and 1980s as a response to the commercialization of Hollywood films. Indiewood films often prioritize artistic and creative expression over commercial appeal, and are frequently characterized by their low budgets, innovative storytelling, and a focus on emerging talent.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe term \"Indiewood\" was first coined in the 1990s to describe the intersection of independent filmmaking and Hollywood. It was popularized by films such as _Sex, Lies, and Videotape_ (1989) and _Clerks_ (1994), which found success on the festival circuit and later became cult classics. Indiewood films often blend elements of independent cinema with the commercial appeal of Hollywood blockbusters, making them a unique and popular genre.\n\n**Divisions**\n\nIndiewood films can be divided into several subcategories, including:\n\n* **Art House Films**: These films prioritize artistic expression and often feature complex, avant-garde storytelling. Examples include _The Tree of Life_ (2011) and _Being John Malkovich_ (1999).\n* **Cult Films**: These films have gained a dedicated following over time, often due to their unique or quirky nature. Examples include _Eraserhead_ (1977) and _The Big Lebowski_ (1998).\n* **Quirky Comedies**: These films often feature offbeat humor and characters, and frequently appeal to a niche audience. Examples include _Ghost World_ (2001) and _Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind_ (2004).\n\n**Other \"mini-major\" subdivisions/indie distributors**\n\nSeveral companies have emerged as mini-majors or indie distributors, operating outside of the major Hollywood studios. These include:\n\n* **A24**: A production company and distributor that has produced and released films such as _Moonlight_ (2016) and _Lady Bird_ (2017).\n* **Focus Features**: A subsidiary of Universal Pictures that specializes in producing and distributing art house and independent films, including _Amélie_ (2001) and _The Theory of Everything_ (2014).\n* **Miramax**: A film production and distribution company that has produced and released films such as _Pulp Fiction_ (1994) and _The English Patient_ (1996).\n\n**Differences from Hollywood**\n\nIndiewood films often differ from Hollywood productions in several key ways:\n\n* **Budget**: Indiewood films frequently have lower budgets than Hollywood blockbusters, which allows for greater creative freedom and experimentation.\n* **Storytelling**: Indiewood films often prioritize complex, nuanced storytelling over straightforward, crowd-pleasing plots.\n* **Tone**: Indiewood films can have a more offbeat or quirky tone than Hollywood productions, which may appeal to a niche audience.\n\n**List of selected Indiewood/Pre-Indiewood filmmakers**\n\nSome notable filmmakers who have worked in the Indiewood genre or contributed to its development include:\n\n* **John Cassavetes**: A pioneer of independent cinema, known for films such as _Shadows_ (1959) and _A Woman Under the Influence_ (1974).\n* **Woody Allen**: A prolific filmmaker and comedian, known for films such as _Annie Hall_ (1977) and _Manhattan_ (1979).\n* **Martin Scorsese**: A director known for films such as _Mean Streets_ (1973) and _Raging Bull_ (1980).\n* **Spike Lee**: A director known for films such as _She's Gotta Have It_ (1986) and _Do the Right Thing_ (1989).\n* **Quentin Tarantino**: A director known for films such as _Pulp Fiction_ (1994) and _Reservoir Dogs_ (1992).\n\n**List of selected notable and important Pre-Indiewood films**\n\n**Pre-1950s**\n\n* _City Lights_ (1931) - A silent film by Charlie Chaplin\n* _The Rules of the Game_ (1939) - A French film by Jean Renoir\n\n**1950s**\n\n* _Breathless_ (1959) - A French film by Jean-Luc Godard\n* _Shadows_ (1959) - A film by John Cassavetes\n* _The Connection_ (1961) - A film by Shirley Clarke\n\n**1960s**\n\n* _Cleopatra_ (1963) - A film by Joseph L.

From ancient myths and legends to modern-day novels and films, fantasy has evolved over time, influenced by social, cultural, and historical contexts. This article will explore the development of fantasy, tracing its roots in earlier forms of fiction and examining its growth into the distinct genre we know today.\n\n**Differences between fantasy and earlier fantastic works**\n\nWhile fantasy as a genre has distinct characteristics, it often blurs the lines with other forms of fiction, such as mythology, legend, and folklore. Early works of fiction often featured fantastical elements, but they differed from modern fantasy in their approach and purpose. For example, ancient myths and legends often served religious, cultural, or historical purposes, whereas modern fantasy tends to focus on entertainment and storytelling.\n\nIn contrast to earlier fantastic works, fantasy as a genre often involves a deliberate attempt to create a sense of wonder, magic, and enchantment. While earlier forms of fiction may have included supernatural elements, they were often grounded in reality and served a specific purpose. Fantasy, on the other hand, tends to be more self-conscious, with authors often using fantastical elements to explore complex themes and ideas.\n\n**Development of fantasy**\n\nThe development of fantasy as a distinct genre was a gradual process, influenced by a range of social, cultural, and historical factors.\n\n### **Romances**\n\nOne of the earliest forms of fiction that laid the groundwork for fantasy was the romance. From ancient Greece and Rome to medieval Europe, romances often featured fantastical elements, such as magical creatures, enchanted landscapes, and supernatural beings. These works were often written in verse and were intended to entertain and educate readers.\n\nRomances often served as a way to explore complex themes and ideas, such as love, chivalry, and duty. They also provided a framework for social commentary, with authors using fantastical elements to critique societal norms and conventions.\n\n### **The Enlightenment**\n\nDuring the Enlightenment, the concept of reason and rationality became increasingly prominent. As a result, many fantastical elements were seen as inferior to more rational and scientific explanations. However, this did not mean that fantasy disappeared entirely. Instead, it evolved to become more subtle and nuanced, with authors using symbolism and metaphor to convey complex ideas and themes.\n\nThe Enlightenment also saw the rise of the novel as a literary form. Novels like Defoe's \"Robinson Crusoe\" and Swift's \"Gulliver's Travels\" showcased the potential of fiction to explore complex themes and ideas, often using fantastical elements to do so.\n\n### **Romanticism**\n\nThe Romantic movement of the late 18th and early 19th centuries marked a significant turning point in the development of fantasy. Romantics emphasized the importance of imagination, emotion, and the individual experience. This led to a renewed interest in fantasy and the supernatural, with authors like Mary Shelley and John Polidori exploring themes of horror and the gothic.\n\nThe Romantic movement also saw the rise of the concept of the \"sublime,\" which emphasized the power and majesty of nature. This led to a greater emphasis on the fantastical and the supernatural in literature, with authors using these elements to explore the complexities of human experience.\n\n**Modern fantasy**\n\nThe modern era of fantasy, which began in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, marked a significant departure from earlier forms of fiction. This was largely due to the influence of J.R.R. Tolkien, who is widely regarded as the father of modern fantasy.\n\n### **Pre-Tolkien**\n\nBefore Tolkien, fantasy was often associated with children's literature and was seen as inferior to more \"serious\" forms of fiction. However, authors like William Morris and Lord Dunsany were already exploring the potential of fantasy as a literary form, creating rich and complex worlds that drew on mythology and folklore.\n\nThese authors often emphasized the importance of storytelling and the power of imagination, laying the groundwork for the modern fantasy genre.\n\n### **Tolkien**\n\nJ.R.R. Tolkien's \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\" trilogy marked a significant turning point in the development of modern fantasy. Tolkien's works were highly influential, drawing on mythology, folklore, and language to create rich and complex worlds.\n\nTolkien's emphasis on world-building and the importance of storytelling helped to establish fantasy as a distinct genre, one that could be taken seriously by readers and authors alike.\n\n### **Post-Tolkien**\n\nSince Tolkien, modern fantasy has continued to evolve, with authors like Ursula K. Le Guin, Neil Gaiman, and Patrick Rothfuss pushing the boundaries of the genre.\n\nThese authors have explored a range of themes and ideas, from environmentalism and social justice to mythology and the supernatural. They have also continued to experiment with different styles and forms, from novels and short stories to comic books and graphic novels.\n\nModern fantasy has become increasingly diverse, with authors from around the world contributing to the genre. This has led to a greater emphasis on cultural and historical accuracy, as well as a greater awareness of the complex social and cultural contexts in which fantasy is written and read.\n\n**References**\n\nFor further reading on the history of fantasy, see:\n\n* Maria Tatar, \"The Annotated Classic Fairy Tales\"\n* Marina Warner, \"From the Beast to the Blonde: On Fairy Tales and Their Tellers\"\n* Donald R.

The strike, which lasted for several months, was one of the most significant labor disputes in the entertainment industry in recent years.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Unionization in Hollywood\n\nThe history of unionization in Hollywood dates back to the 1920s, when the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America (MPPDA) was established to represent the interests of film producers. In the 1930s, the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) was formed to represent the interests of actors. Over the years, other unions, including the Writers Guild of America (WGA), the Directors Guild of America (DGA), and the Producers Guild of America (PGA), were established to represent the interests of writers, directors, and producers, respectively.\n\n### Pre-strike activity\n\nIn the months leading up to the strike, SAG-AFTRA leaders claimed that the industry's profits had increased significantly, but that the union's members had not received fair compensation. They argued that the union's contract, which was set to expire in June 2023, did not provide for adequate wages, benefits, and working conditions for its members. The union also claimed that the industry's use of new technologies, such as streaming and artificial intelligence, had created new challenges for its members.\n\nIn response to these concerns, SAG-AFTRA leaders organized a series of meetings and rallies with their members, as well as with industry executives and politicians. The union also launched a series of public awareness campaigns, including social media campaigns, to raise awareness about the issues facing its members.\n\n**Timeline**\n\n### July\n\nThe SAG-AFTRA leadership announced that it would be seeking a new contract with the AMPTP, which would include demands for higher wages, improved benefits, and better working conditions. The union also announced that it would be conducting a series of meetings with its members to discuss the issues facing the industry.\n\n### August\n\nThe AMPTP responded to the SAG-AFTRA demands by offering a counter-proposal that included some concessions, but not all of the demands made by the union. The union rejected the counter-proposal, citing concerns that it did not go far enough to address the issues facing its members.\n\n### September\n\nThe SAG-AFTRA leadership announced that it would be taking a strike authorization vote, which would determine whether the union would authorize a strike. The vote was overwhelmingly in favor of a strike, with 96% of members voting in favor.\n\n### October\n\nThe SAG-AFTRA leadership announced that it would be going on strike, effective October 15, 2023. The union claimed that the strike would be the largest in the entertainment industry in decades, with thousands of actors, writers, and other industry professionals participating.\n\n### November\n\nThe strike continued, with the union and the AMPTP engaging in talks to resolve the dispute. The union claimed that the industry's profits had increased significantly, but that the union's members had not received fair compensation.\n\n### December\n\nThe strike continued, with the union and the AMPTP engaging in talks to resolve the dispute. The union claimed that the industry's use of new technologies, such as streaming and artificial intelligence, had created new challenges for its members.\n\n**Strike activity and responses**\n\n### Locations\n\nThe strike was participated in by thousands of actors, writers, and other industry professionals at locations across the United States, including film and television studios, production companies, and industry organizations. The strike also had an impact on international productions, with some productions being shut down or delayed due to the strike.\n\n### Media executives' response\n\nThe AMPTP responded to the strike by claiming that the union's demands were unreasonable and that the industry could not afford to meet them. The union claimed that the industry's profits had increased significantly, but that the union's members had not received fair compensation.\n\n### Politicians' response\n\nSome politicians, including politicians from the Democratic Party, responded to the strike by expressing support for the union and its demands. Others, including politicians from the Republican Party, expressed opposition to the strike and claimed that it was unnecessary.\n\n### Other unions' response\n\nOther unions, including the Writers Guild of America and the Directors Guild of America, expressed support for the SAG-AFTRA strike and its demands. The Producers Guild of America, however, did not take a position on the strike.\n\n### Other organizations' response\n\nOther organizations, including industry associations and advocacy groups, responded to the strike by expressing support for the union and its demands. Some organizations, however, expressed opposition to the strike and claimed that it was unnecessary.\n\n### Impact\n\nThe strike had a significant impact on the entertainment industry, with some productions being shut down or delayed due to the strike. The strike also had an impact on the economy, with some estimates suggesting that the strike could cost the industry billions of dollars.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe strike ended on December 31, 2023, after several months of negotiation between the SAG-AFTRA leadership and the AMPTP. The agreement reached included some concessions from the industry, including higher wages and improved benefits for union members. However, some union leaders claimed that the agreement did not go far enough to address the issues facing the industry.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists\n* Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers\n* Writers Guild of America\n* Directors Guild of America\n* Producers Guild of America\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is based on publicly available information and may not reflect the views of the SAG-AFTRA leadership or the AMPTP.\n\n**References**\n\n* None\n\n**External links**\n\n* SAG-AFTRA official website\n* Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers official website\n* Writers Guild of America official website\n* Directors Guild of America official website\n* Producers Guild of America official website", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

He played a crucial part in the Union victory, particularly at the Battle of Gettysburg, which is considered a turning point in the war.\n\nEarly life and education\n\nMeade was born on December 31, 1815, in Cádiz, Spain, to Richard Worsam Meade and Margaret Gardner. He was the second of five children. His father was a naval officer in the U.S. Navy, and the family moved frequently during Meade's childhood. Meade's early education took place in various parts of the world, including England and the United States. He attended the United States Military Academy at West Point, graduating in 1835 as a second lieutenant in the United States Corps of Topographical Engineers.\n\nTopographical Corps and Mexican-American War\n\nMeade's first assignment was to work with the Topographical Corps, which was responsible for mapping the country's terrain and infrastructure. He worked on various projects, including mapping the Mississippi River and the Rio Grande. Meade also saw action during the Mexican-American War, participating in the Battle of Veracruz and the Battle of Chapultepec. He rose through the ranks to become a captain by the end of the war.\n\nAmerican Civil War\n\nMeade played a significant role in the American Civil War, particularly as the commander of the Army of the Potomac.\n\nPeninsula campaign\n\nIn 1862, Meade was appointed as the chief engineer of the Army of the Potomac. During the Peninsula campaign, he was involved in the planning and execution of several battles, including the Battle of Seven Pines and the Battle of Gaines' Mill.\n\nMaryland campaign\n\nIn September 1862, Meade was promoted to brigadier general and took command of the Iron Brigade. He played a key role in the Battle of Antietam, where he was wounded.\n\nFredericksburg and Chancellorsville\n\nMeade was promoted to major general in 1863 and took command of the V Corps. He saw action at the Battle of Fredericksburg and the Battle of Chancellorsville.\n\nGettysburg campaign\n\nCommand of the Army of the Potomac\n\nMeade was appointed as the commander of the Army of the Potomac in June 1863, replacing General Joseph Hooker.\n\nBattle of Gettysburg\n\nMeade's leadership during the Battle of Gettysburg was instrumental in the Union victory. He took command of the army on the second day of the battle and made several key decisions that contributed to the Union's success. Meade's troops defended the high ground on Cemetery Ridge, and on the third day of the battle, they launched a counterattack that repelled the Confederate charge.\n\nLee's retreat\n\nAfter the Battle of Gettysburg, Meade's army pursued the retreating Confederate forces. Meade's leadership during this period was marked by his ability to coordinate his troops and maintain the pressure on the Confederates.\n\nBristoe and Mine Run campaign\n\nIn the fall of 1863, Meade's army clashed with the Confederates at the Battle of Bristoe Station and the Battle of Mine Run.\n\nOverland campaign\n\nIn 1864, Meade's army participated in the Overland campaign, which was a series of battles fought in Virginia. The campaign was marked by brutal fighting and heavy casualties.\n\nRichmond-Petersburg campaign\n\nIn the spring of 1865, Meade's army besieged the Confederate capital of Richmond and the city of Petersburg. The campaign was marked by intense fighting and heavy casualties.\n\nPolitical rivalries\n\nMeade was often at odds with other high-ranking Union officers, including General Ulysses S. Grant and General William Tecumseh Sherman. These rivalries were often due to differences in strategy and personality.\n\nReconstruction\n\nAfter the war, Meade was involved in the Reconstruction efforts in the South. He was appointed as the military governor of Georgia and worked to establish a new government in the state.\n\nPersonal life\n\nMeade was married to Margaretta Sergeant Meade, and they had one son, George Meade Jr. Meade was a close friend of President Abraham Lincoln and was a strong supporter of the Union cause.\n\nLater life and death\n\nMeade retired from the military in 1865 and returned to his home in Philadelphia. He died on November 6, 1872, and was buried in Laurel Hill Cemetery.\n\nLegacy\n\nMeade's legacy is complex and multifaceted. He is remembered as a skilled military leader who played a crucial role in the Union victory. He is also remembered for his role in the Reconstruction efforts in the South. However, his legacy has also been marred by controversy, including his involvement in the destruction of the Confederate capital and his role in the suppression of the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nMemorials to Meade\n\nThere are several memorials to Meade around the country, including a statue in Gettysburg and a monument in Philadelphia.\n\nIn popular culture\n\nMeade has been portrayed in several films and television shows, including the movie \"Gettysburg\" and the television series \"The Civil War.\"\n\nDates of rank\n\nMeade's dates of rank are as follows:\n\n* Second lieutenant, United States Corps of Topographical Engineers: 1835\n* Captain, United States Corps of Topographical Engineers: 1847\n* Brigadier general, Union Army: 1862\n* Major general, Union Army: 1863\n* General, Union Army: 1864\n\nSee also\n\n* List of American Civil War generals\n* History of the United States during the American Civil War\n* Gettysburg campaign\n* Battle of Gettysburg\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n* George Meade at the Dictionary of American Biography\n* George Meade at the Handbook of Texas Online", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

He is best known for his exposés on government secrecy, corruption, and human rights abuses, particularly in the context of the Vietnam War and the War on Terror. Hersh's work has appeared in various publications, including The New York Times, The Washington Post, and Rolling Stone.\n\n**Early life and education**\n\nHersh was born on April 8, 1937, in Chicago, Illinois. He grew up in a working-class Jewish family and developed an early interest in politics and social justice. Hersh attended South Shore High School in Chicago and later enrolled at the City College of New York, where he studied accounting. However, he dropped out of college after two years to work as a journalist for the City News Bureau of Chicago.\n\n**Newspaper career**\n\nHersh began his journalism career in the 1960s as a reporter for the City News Bureau of Chicago. In 1963, he joined the Associated Press (AP) as a reporter, covering the civil rights movement and the Vietnam War. Hersh's early reporting experience prepared him for the investigative journalism that would become his hallmark.\n\n**My Lai massacre**\n\nOne of Hersh's most significant early investigations was the My Lai massacre, a series of atrocities committed by American soldiers in Vietnam in 1968. Hersh's reporting exposed the horrific details of the massacre, including the killing of civilians and the destruction of villages. His story sparked widespread outrage and helped to galvanize public opinion against the Vietnam War.\n\n**The New York Times**\n\nIn 1972, Hersh joined The New York Times as a senior investigative reporter. During his time at the Times, Hersh continued to expose government secrets and corruption, including the CIA's secret bombing of Cambodia and the FBI's surveillance of anti-war activists. Hersh's reporting earned him a Pulitzer Prize in 1970 for his exposé on the My Lai massacre.\n\n**Investigative books: 1980s and 1990s**\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, Hersh began to author investigative books on government secrecy and corruption. His books, such as \"The Price of Power: Kissinger in the Nixon White House\" (1983) and \"The Dark Side of Camelot\" (1997), exposed the personal and professional scandals of high-ranking government officials, including Henry Kissinger and John F. Kennedy.\n\n**Later investigations**\n\nIn the 2000s and 2010s, Hersh continued to investigate government secrecy and corruption, particularly in the context of the War on Terror. Some of his notable investigations include:\n\n**Iraq and Abu Ghraib**\n\nHersh's reporting exposed the abuse of Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison, including instances of torture and humiliation. His stories helped to galvanize public opinion against the Iraq War and led to calls for accountability from government officials.\n\n**Iran**\n\nHersh's reporting on Iran has focused on the country's nuclear program and its relationship with the United States. He has exposed secret agreements between the US and Iran, as well as instances of US covert operations in the country.\n\n**Syria and chemical attacks**\n\nHersh's reporting on Syria has focused on the country's civil war and the use of chemical attacks by government forces. He has exposed the role of the US and other Western countries in supporting rebel groups and has questioned the official narrative on the chemical attacks.\n\n**Killing of Osama bin Laden**\n\nHersh's reporting on the killing of Osama bin Laden has raised questions about the official narrative of the operation. He has suggested that the US may have fabricated evidence of bin Laden's death and that the operation may have been motivated by a desire to cover up US intelligence failures.\n\n**Nord Stream pipeline and Ukraine**\n\nHersh's reporting on the Nord Stream pipeline has focused on the US government's efforts to undermine the project and its potential impact on European energy security. He has exposed secret agreements between the US and Ukraine and has suggested that the US may have been involved in the sabotage of the pipeline.\n\n**Other statements**\n\nHersh has made several notable statements outside of his reporting, including:\n\n**Speeches**\n\nHersh has given several speeches on the topic of government secrecy and corruption. In a 2013 speech, he criticized the US government's use of propaganda and disinformation to justify its military interventions.\n\n**Murder of Seth Rich**\n\nHersh has made several statements about the murder of Seth Rich, a Democratic National Committee staffer who was killed in 2016. He has suggested that Rich's murder was linked to the hacking of the DNC's emails and that the US government may have been involved in the cover-up.\n\n**Pat Nixon abuse**\n\nHersh has made several statements about the abuse of Pat Nixon, the wife of President Richard Nixon. He has suggested that Pat Nixon was a victim of domestic violence and that her husband's administration may have covered up the abuse.\n\n**Use of anonymous sources**\n\nHersh has been criticized for his use of anonymous sources in his reporting. He has defended his use of anonymous sources as necessary to protect his sources and to gather information that would otherwise be unavailable.\n\n**Personal life**\n\nHersh is a private person and keeps his personal life out of the public eye. He is married and has two children.\n\n**Awards and honors**\n\nHersh has won several awards for his reporting, including:\n\n* Pulitzer Prize (1970)\n* George Polk Award (1969)\n* National Press Club Award (1972)\n* Edward R. Murrow Award (1973)\n\n**Publications**\n\nHersh has written several books on government secrecy and corruption, including:\n\n* \"My Lai 4: A Report on the Massacre and Its Aftermath\" (1970)\n* \"The Price of Power: Kissinger in the Nixon White House\" (1983)\n* \"The Dark Side of Camelot\" (1997)\n* \"Chain of Command: The Road from 9/11 to Abu Ghraib\" (2004)\n* \"The Driver and the Passenger\" (2016)\n\nHe has also written articles for various publications, including The New York Times, The Washington Post, and Rolling Stone.\n\n**References**\n\n* \"Seymour Hersh: A Biography\" by James M.

He was a member of the powerful House of Retz and a companion in arms of Joan of Arc. However, his life took a dark turn when he was accused of occult involvement and child murder. This article will explore his life, military career, and eventual downfall.\n\nHouse of Retz\n--------------\n\n### Early life\n\nGilles de Rais was born around 1404 in Champtocé, a castle in the province of Anjou, France. He was the second son of Guy de Rais, a nobleman of the House of Retz, and his wife, Marie de Craon. Gilles' early life is shrouded in mystery, but it is known that he received a good education and was trained in the arts of war from a young age.\n\n### Matrimonial projects\n\nAs a young man, Gilles de Rais was involved in several matrimonial projects. He was betrothed to Catherine de Thouars, a member of the powerful House of Thouars, but the marriage was ultimately canceled due to Gilles' involvement in military campaigns. He later became engaged to Catherine de Bourbon, a member of the royal family, but the engagement was also short-lived.\n\n### Family disputes\n\nGilles de Rais was involved in several family disputes throughout his life.

He was present at the siege of Orléans, where Joan of Arc played a key role in the French victory.\n\n### Civil wars between La Trémoille and Richemont's allies\n\nGilles de Rais was also involved in the civil wars between La Trémoille and Richemont's allies. He supported the faction led by La Trémoille, who was a powerful nobleman and a rival of Richemont.\n\n### Lifting of the siege of Lagny\n\nIn 1439, Gilles de Rais led a successful campaign against the English garrisons in the province of Champagne. He lifted the siege of Lagny, a city that had been under siege for several months.\n\n### Reduction of military commitments\n\nAs the Hundred Years' War came to an end, Gilles de Rais reduced his military commitments. He began to focus on his family's inheritance and his own personal affairs.\n\nSquandering of heritage\n-----------------------\n\nGilles de Rais' life took a dark turn when he began to squander his family's heritage. He became involved in lavish spending and extravagant lifestyle, which led to significant financial difficulties.\n\nCriminal life\n--------------\n\n### Occult involvement\n\nGilles de Rais was accused of occult involvement, including the practice of witchcraft and the use of demonic powers. He was said to have made a pact with the devil and to have used his powers to commit crimes.\n\n### Child murders\n\nGilles de Rais was also accused of child murder.

He was said to have killed a young boy in the village, whom he had taken for his alleged occult practices.\n\n### Ecclesiastical and secular investigations\n\nGilles de Rais was subject to both ecclesiastical and secular investigations. He was accused of heresy and witchcraft by the Catholic Church, while the French authorities accused him of murder and treason.\n\n### Trial and execution\n\nGilles de Rais was put on trial in 1440, where he was found guilty of heresy, witchcraft, and murder. He was sentenced to death and executed on October 26, 1440.\n\nQuestion of guilt\n----------------\n\n### Doubts about the verdict in the Age of Enlightenment tradition\n\nThere are doubts about the verdict in the Age of Enlightenment tradition. Some historians have questioned the validity of the trial and the guilt of Gilles de Rais. They argue that the trial was a sham and that the verdict was predetermined.\n\n### Occultist interpretations\n\nSome occultists have interpreted Gilles de Rais' actions as a form of magical practice. They argue that he was using his powers to achieve spiritual enlightenment and to gain knowledge of the unknown.\n\n### Georges Bataille's interpretations\n\nGeorges Bataille, a French philosopher, has interpreted Gilles de Rais' actions as a form of transgressive behavior. He argues that Gilles de Rais was pushing the boundaries of what was acceptable in society and that his actions were a form of rebellion against the norms of his time.\n\n### 1992 mock re-trial\n\nIn 1992, a mock re-trial was held in the French city of Nantes, where Gilles de Rais was acquitted of all charges. The trial was a form of symbolic re-examination of the case and was intended to shed new light on the events surrounding Gilles de Rais' life and death.\n\n### Contemporary academic views\n\nContemporary academic views on Gilles de Rais vary widely.

Characterized by a renewed interest in classical Greek and Roman art, this style emphasized humanism, individualism, and realism, influencing artists, patrons, and the broader society.\n\n**Periods**\n\nItalian Renaissance sculpture spans several periods, each marked by distinct artistic developments and innovations.\n\n### From 1300 to 1400\n\nDuring this period, the rise of humanism and the rediscovery of classical Greek and Roman art had a profound impact on Italian sculpture. Artists such as Arnolfo di Cambio and Jacopo della Quercia began to experiment with new forms and techniques, laying the groundwork for the Renaissance style.\n\n### From 1400 to 1500\n\nThe 15th century saw a surge in creative innovation, as artists such as Donatello, Michelangelo, and Lorenzo Ghiberti pushed the boundaries of sculpture. This period was marked by the development of the Renaissance ideal, characterized by a focus on humanism, realism, and classical proportions.\n\n### Doors of the Florence Baptistery\n\nOne of the most significant works of the period is Lorenzo Ghiberti's bronze doors for the Florence Baptistery, created between 1403 and 1424. These doors, featuring scenes from the Bible, showcase Ghiberti's mastery of relief sculpture and his ability to convey emotion and drama through his art.\n\n### Donatello\n\nDonatello, a leading figure of the period, is renowned for his innovative and expressive sculptures. His works, such as the bronze statue of David (c. 1408-1409), demonstrate a departure from the traditional conventions of sculpture, showcasing a more naturalistic and humanistic approach.\n\n### Middle of the century\n\nAs the century progressed, artists began to experiment with new techniques and materials. The use of perspective, developed by artists such as Brunelleschi and Alberti, revolutionized the art of sculpture, allowing artists to create more realistic and three-dimensional works.\n\n### Lombardy\n\nLombardy, a region in northern Italy, became a hub for artistic innovation during the 15th century. Artists such as Michelino da Besozzo and Bernadino Butinone created works that showcased a unique blend of Gothic and Renaissance styles.\n\n### Crisis of the 1490s\n\nThe 1490s saw a crisis in the art world, as the rise of Mannerism and the decline of the High Renaissance style led to a period of artistic experimentation and fragmentation.\n\n### 16th century\n\nThe 16th century saw the emergence of new styles and techniques, as artists such as Michelangelo, Giambologna, and Benvenuto Cellini pushed the boundaries of sculpture.\n\n### Michelangelo\n\nMichelangelo, one of the greatest sculptors of all time, is renowned for his masterpiece, the statue of David (1501-1504). This work, created for the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore in Florence, showcases Michelangelo's mastery of sculpture, demonstrating a perfect balance of form, proportion, and emotion.\n\n### Mannerist and Late Renaissance sculpture\n\nMannerist sculpture, characterized by a sense of tension and uncertainty, emerged in the 16th century. Artists such as Ammannati and Bandinelli created works that showcased a departure from the classical ideals of the High Renaissance, emphasizing emotion and drama over classical proportions.\n\n### Giambologna\n\nGiambologna, a Flemish sculptor, is renowned for his innovative and expressive works, which showcased a unique blend of Mannerist and Late Renaissance styles. His statue of Samson and the Philistine (c. 1590-1595) is a masterpiece of the period, demonstrating a perfect balance of form, proportion, and emotion.\n\n**Materials**\n\nItalian Renaissance sculpture employed a range of materials, each with its unique characteristics and challenges.\n\n### Stone\n\nStone, a traditional material for sculpture, was used extensively during the Renaissance period. Artists such as Michelangelo and Bernini created works that showcased the beauty and expressiveness of stone.\n\n### Metal\n\nMetal, particularly bronze, was used for a range of sculptures, from small reliefs to large statues. Artists such as Donatello and Verrocchio created works that showcased the versatility and expressiveness of metal.\n\n### Wood\n\nWood, a less common material for sculpture, was used by artists such as Bernini and Bernini's assistants to create small, intricate works.\n\n### Terracotta\n\nTerracotta, a type of earthenware, was used for a range of sculptures, from small decorative pieces to large, complex works.\n\n### Other materials\n\nOther materials, such as ivory, bone, and glass, were used by artists to create small, intricate works.\n\n### Coloured sculpture\n\nColoured sculpture, a departure from the traditional conventions of sculpture, emerged during the Renaissance period. Artists such as Domenico Ghirlandaio and Lorenzo Lotto created works that showcased a unique blend of colour and form.\n\n**Settings**\n\nItalian Renaissance sculpture was created for a range of settings, each with its unique characteristics and challenges.\n\n### Churches and tombs\n\nChurches and tombs were a common setting for sculpture, as artists such as Michelangelo and Bernini created works that showcased the beauty and expressiveness of sculpture.\n\n### Civic pride\n\nCivic pride, a sense of community and civic responsibility, drove the creation of many sculptures during the Renaissance period. Artists such as Lorenzo Ghiberti and Donatello created works that showcased the beauty and expressiveness of sculpture.\n\n### Fountains\n\nFountains, a common feature of Renaissance cities, were decorated with sculptures that showcased the beauty and expressiveness of water.\n\n### Portraits\n\nPortraits, a popular genre of sculpture, were created by artists such as Michelangelo and Bernini to capture the likeness and character of individuals.\n\n### Equestrian statues\n\nEquestrian statues, a rare genre of sculpture, were created by artists such as Donatello and Michelangelo to showcase the beauty and expressiveness of horses.\n\n### Shoulder busts\n\nShoulder busts, a common genre of sculpture, were created by artists such as Bernini and Domenico Ghirlandaio to capture the likeness and character of individuals.\n\n### Medals\n\nMedals, a popular genre of sculpture, were created by artists such as Michelangelo and Benvenuto Cellini to capture the likeness and character of individuals.\n\n### Small sculpture\n\nSmall sculpture, a popular genre of sculpture, was created by artists such as Domenico Ghirlandaio and Lorenzo Lotto to capture the beauty and expressiveness of small forms.\n\n**Workshops**\n\nItalian Renaissance sculpture was created in a range of workshops, each with its unique characteristics and challenges.\n\n### Women sculptors\n\nWomen sculptors, a rare group during the Renaissance period, included artists such as Sofonisba Anguissola and Lavinia Fontana, who created works that showcased their skill and expressiveness.\n\n**Guilds**\n\nGuilds, a common feature of Renaissance cities, played a significant role in the creation and dissemination of sculpture.\n\n**Patrons**\n\nPatrons, a common feature of Renaissance art, played a significant role in the creation and dissemination of sculpture.\n\n**Development of style**\n\nItalian Renaissance sculpture developed over several centuries, influenced by a range of factors and cultural movements.\n\n**To 1400**\n\nThe development of Italian Renaissance sculpture was influenced by a range of factors, including the rediscovery of classical Greek and Roman art and the rise of humanism.\n\n**From 1400**\n\nThe development of Italian Renaissance sculpture was influenced by a range of factors, including the emergence of new styles and techniques and the rise of Mannerism.\n\n**16th century**\n\nThe development of Italian Renaissance sculpture was influenced by a range of factors, including the emergence of new styles and techniques and the rise of Late Renaissance sculpture.\n\n**Italians abroad**\n\nItalians abroad, a common feature of Renaissance art, played a significant role in the creation and dissemination of sculpture.\n\n**Notes**\n\nItalian Renaissance sculpture is a style that transformed the art of sculpture in Italy, marking a significant departure from the Gothic style prevalent in the earlier medieval period.

From its humble beginnings in the Middle East to its current global presence, Christianity has evolved significantly over time, shaping the lives of individuals, communities, and societies around the world.\n\n**Early Christianity**\n\n### **Jewish Background**\n\nChristianity emerged from Judaism, a monotheistic faith that originated in the Middle East around 1800 BCE. The Jews believed in one God, Yahweh, who had created the world and governed the universe. They also believed in the importance of following the Torah, the first five books of the Hebrew Bible. The Jewish faith was characterized by a strong emphasis on ethics, morality, and the importance of worshiping only one God.\n\n### **Apostolic Age (c. 30–100)**\n\nThe Apostolic Age began with the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, who is considered the central figure of Christianity. Jesus was a Jewish preacher who taught about the importance of love, compassion, and forgiveness. He gathered a group of followers, including Peter, John, and Paul, who became the leaders of the early Christian community.\n\n#### **Developing Church Structure**\n\nDuring the Apostolic Age, the early Christian community developed a church structure, with bishops, priests, and deacons serving as leaders.

The apostles traveled extensively, preaching and teaching about Jesus, and establishing churches in various parts of the Mediterranean world.\n\n**Ante-Nicene period (100–312)**\n\n### **Scripture**\n\nDuring the Ante-Nicene period, the early Christian community began to develop its own scriptures, which would eventually become the New Testament.

However, as the church grew and became more organized, it began to adopt more exclusive practices, such as requiring baptism and excluding non-Christians.\n\n### **Moral Practices**\n\nThe early Christian community emphasized the importance of moral practices, such as forgiveness, compassion, and kindness.

This process of developing orthodoxy and heresy led to the emergence of various Christian denominations and traditions.\n\n**Church of the East**\n\nDuring the Late Antiquity period, the Church of the East emerged as a distinct Christian denomination, which emphasized the importance of preserving the traditions and practices of the early Christian community.\n\n**Hospitals**\n\nThe early Christian community developed a system of hospitals and charitable institutions, which provided care and support to the sick, the poor, and the marginalized.\n\n**Art and Literature**\n\nThe early Christian community produced a significant body of art and literature, which reflected its values and traditions. This included works such as the writings of Saint Augustine, the poetry of Saint Ambrose, and the art of the Byzantine Empire.\n\n**Spread and Growth of Christianity**\n\nDuring the Late Antiquity period, Christianity spread rapidly throughout the Mediterranean world, with many people converting to the faith.

The election was held after the resignation of Prime Minister Liz Truss, who had become the shortest-serving Prime Minister in British history, serving for only 49 days. The election was the third leadership contest in the Conservative Party since 2019, following the resignations of Theresa May and Boris Johnson.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Boris Johnson premiership and scandals\n\nBoris Johnson had become the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in July 2019, following the resignation of Theresa May. His premiership was marked by a series of scandals, including the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Partygate scandal, and the row over the Northern Ireland protocol. Despite these controversies, Johnson remained popular with the Conservative Party membership, who saw him as a strong leader capable of delivering Brexit.\n\n### Leadership election to succeed Johnson\n\nIn July 2022, Johnson announced that he would step down as Prime Minister, following a confidence vote among Conservative MPs. The leadership election to succeed him was won by Liz Truss, who defeated Rishi Sunak in the final round of voting. Truss's victory was seen as a surprise, given the concerns about her lack of experience and her tax-cutting policies.\n\n### Liz Truss premiership and scandals\n\nLiz Truss became the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom on September 6, 2022, and quickly announced a series of policies aimed at stimulating economic growth, including tax cuts and deregulation. However, her premiership was marked by controversy, including a mini-budget that was widely criticized by economists and opposition parties. Truss's popularity began to decline, and she faced calls for her resignation following a series of scandals, including the handling of the energy crisis and the suspension of parliament.\n\n### Calls for Truss's resignation\n\nTruss faced growing calls for her resignation from within her own party, following a series of polls showing that she was no longer popular with the public. Many Conservative MPs began to question her leadership, and there were rumors of a leadership challenge. Truss remained defiant, but it became clear that her premiership was under threat.\n\n### Resignations and vote on fracking\n\nOn October 20, 2022, the government announced that it would hold a vote on fracking in the House of Commons. The vote was seen as a test of Truss's authority, and it was widely expected that she would lose. However, the vote was delayed, and on October 25, Truss announced that she would resign as Prime Minister, following a meeting with the chairman of the 1922 Committee.\n\n### Liz Truss resigns\n\nLiz Truss resigned as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom on October 25, 2022, following a meeting with the chairman of the 1922 Committee. She became the shortest-serving Prime Minister in British history, serving for only 49 days. The leadership election to succeed her began immediately, with several candidates expressing interest in the position.\n\n**Campaign**\n\nThe campaign for the leadership election was intense, with several candidates vying for the position. The candidates were:\n\n* Rishi Sunak, the former Chancellor of the Exchequer\n* Liz Truss's former chief of staff, Mark Spencer\n* Penny Mordaunt, the former Secretary of State for Defence\n* Tom Tugendhat, the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee\n* Kemi Badenoch, the former Secretary of State for International Trade\n* Suella Braverman, the former Secretary of State for the Home Department\n* Jeremy Hunt, the former Secretary of State for Health and Social Care\n\nThe campaign was dominated by debates on the economy, immigration, and Brexit. The candidates clashed on their policies, with some calling for a more radical approach to Brexit, while others advocated for a more cautious approach.\n\n**Election process**\n\nThe leadership election was held under the rules of the Conservative Party, which required members to vote in a series of ballots. The first ballot was held on October 28, 2022, and it was won by Rishi Sunak, who received 60% of the vote. However, the election was not over, as the other candidates were given the opportunity to withdraw and endorse Sunak.\n\n**Candidates**\n\n### Declared\n\nThe following candidates declared their intention to stand in the leadership election:\n\n* Rishi Sunak, the former Chancellor of the Exchequer\n* Liz Truss's former chief of staff, Mark Spencer\n* Penny Mordaunt, the former Secretary of State for Defence\n* Tom Tugendhat, the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee\n* Kemi Badenoch, the former Secretary of State for International Trade\n* Suella Braverman, the former Secretary of State for the Home Department\n* Jeremy Hunt, the former Secretary of State for Health and Social Care\n\n### Withdrawn\n\nThe following candidates withdrew from the leadership election:\n\n* None\n\n### Explored\n\nThe following candidates explored the possibility of standing in the leadership election:\n\n* Michael Gove, the former Secretary of State for Levelling Up\n* Sajid Javid, the former Secretary of State for Health and Social Care\n\n### Declined\n\nThe following candidates declined to stand in the leadership election:\n\n* Dominic Raab, the former Deputy Prime Minister\n* Ben Wallace, the Secretary of State for Defence\n* Anne-Marie Trevelyan, the Secretary of State for International Trade\n\n**Endorsements**\n\nSeveral candidates endorsed Rishi Sunak in the leadership election, including:\n\n* Liz Truss's former chief of staff, Mark Spencer\n* Penny Mordaunt, the former Secretary of State for Defence\n* Tom Tugendhat, the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee\n* Kemi Badenoch, the former Secretary of State for International Trade\n\n**Responses**\n\nThe leadership election was met with a range of responses from within the Conservative Party and from the public. Some welcomed the election, seeing it as an opportunity for the party to choose a new leader who could unite the party and deliver a more effective government. Others were more critical, arguing that the election was unnecessary and that the party should focus on its policies rather than its leadership.\n\n**Polling**\n\nSeveral polls were conducted during the leadership election, which showed the preferences of Conservative Party members. The polls were:\n\n* A poll conducted by YouGov on October 28, 2022, which showed that Rishi Sunak was the preferred candidate of 60% of Conservative Party members.\n* A poll conducted by Survation on October 29, 2022, which showed that Rishi Sunak was the preferred candidate of 57% of Conservative Party members.\n\n### Conservative members\n\nThe leadership election was won by Rishi Sunak, who received 60% of the vote in the first ballot.

The work is considered a masterpiece of contemporary literature, weaving together elements of philosophy, history, and art to create a sweeping narrative that explores the complexities of human existence.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe Aesthetics of Resistance is set against the backdrop of the 1968 Mexican student uprising and the subsequent repression of dissent by the Mexican government. The novel's protagonist, a Mexican artist and activist, becomes embroiled in a series of events that lead him to question the nature of art, politics, and resistance in the face of oppression. As the story unfolds, the protagonist grapples with the contradictions and complexities of human experience, drawing on his encounters with artists, intellectuals, and revolutionaries from around the world.\n\nThe novel's narrative is characterized by its use of non-linear storytelling, blending elements of fiction, history, and theory to create a rich and complex tapestry of ideas and experiences.

The second volume delves deeper into the protagonist's encounters with artists and intellectuals, exploring the complexities of human experience and the role of art in shaping social change.

However, with the help of a group of friends and fellow artists, Weiss was able to overcome his creative block and bring the novel to life.\n\n**The third volume**\n\nThe third volume of the novel was the most challenging to write, as Weiss struggled to bring the protagonist's journey to a close. However, with the help of his friends and fellow artists, Weiss was able to find a sense of closure and completion, reflecting on the lessons learned and the challenges faced.\n\n**Sweden and the GDR**\n\nWeiss's experiences in Sweden and the GDR (German Democratic Republic) had a profound impact on the novel, shaping his understanding of the complexities of human existence and the role of art in shaping social change. The novel's use of non-linear storytelling and multiple narrative threads reflects the complexities of Weiss's own experiences, inviting readers to engage with the work on multiple levels.\n\n**Other translations**\n\nThe Aesthetics of Resistance has been translated into numerous languages, including Spanish, French, Italian, and Portuguese. The novel's international popularity reflects its universal themes and its ability to speak to readers across cultural and linguistic boundaries.\n\n**Textual forms**\n\nThe Aesthetics of Resistance is a highly textual work, blending elements of fiction, history, and theory to create a rich and complex tapestry of ideas and experiences.

The UPA was a military organization that fought against the Soviet Union and its German allies, and later against the Soviet Union alone, in a bid to establish an independent Ukrainian state.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe Ukrainian Insurgent Army was formed in 1942, as a result of the merger of two major Ukrainian nationalist organizations, the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN) and the Ukrainian National Army (UNA).

The OUN was led by Stepan Bandera, a Ukrainian nationalist leader who would later become the leader of the UPA. The OUN was a radical organization that advocated for the use of violence to achieve its goals, and it was banned by the Polish government in 1934.\n\n**Outbreak of the war**\n\nGermany's invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941 caught the OUN off guard, but it quickly took advantage of the chaos to launch a campaign of violence against the Soviet authorities. The OUN's military wing, the Ukrainian National Army (UNA), was formed in July 1941, and it began to fight against the Soviet army in Ukraine.\n\n**Creation of OUN-B, pogroms, and anti-Soviet uprising**\n\nIn August 1942, the OUN split into two factions, the OUN-B, led by Stepan Bandera, and the OUN-M, led by Andriy Melnyk. The OUN-B was the more radical of the two factions, and it advocated for the use of violence against both the Soviet and German authorities.

The film is a Viking revenge epic based on the traditional European folklore of the same name and features a star-studded cast, including Alexander Skarsgård, Anya Taylor-Joy, Nicole Kidman, and Willem Dafoe. The Northman premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in May 2022 and received widespread critical acclaim for its visceral action sequences, stunning cinematography, and faithful recreation of Viking culture.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film is set in 10th-century Iceland and follows the story of Amleth (played by Alexander Skarsgård), a young Viking prince who seeks revenge against his uncle, King Fjölnir (played by Claes Bang), for the murder of his father and usurpation of the throne. Amleth's journey takes him from the frozen wilderness of Iceland to the treacherous courts of England, where he must navigate the complexities of Viking politics and confront the darkness within himself.\n\nAs Amleth navigates his quest for revenge, he encounters a series of characters who will aid or hinder his progress, including a mysterious woman named Olga (played by Anya Taylor-Joy), a seer who possesses knowledge of Amleth's destiny, and a group of Viking warriors who are sworn to protect Amleth on his journey.\n\nThroughout the film, Eggers draws heavily from Norse mythology and Viking culture, incorporating elements of the traditional European folklore of the same name.

This growth is expected to be driven by a combination of natural increase and net migration.\n\n**#Politics**\n\nThe Sun Belt is a politically diverse region, with many states having a mix of Republican and Democratic voters.

The tournament is the largest and most prestigious T20 tournament in the world, featuring the top national teams from around the globe.\n\n**History**\n\n### Background\n\nThe concept of a T20 tournament was first introduced in 2003, when the ICC launched the Twenty20 format. The format was created to provide a shorter and more exciting version of the game, with each match lasting around three hours. The first T20 tournament, the Indian Premier League (IPL), was established in 2008 and quickly gained popularity, both in India and around the world.\n\n### Domestic tournaments\n\nThe success of the IPL led to the establishment of other domestic T20 tournaments in various countries, such as the Big Bash League (BBL) in Australia, the Caribbean Premier League (CPL) in the West Indies, and the Pakistan Super League (PSL) in Pakistan. These tournaments provided a platform for domestic players to compete against international players and helped to develop the skills of local cricketers.\n\n### Twenty20 Internationals\n\nThe first Twenty20 International (T20I) match was played between Australia and New Zealand in 2005. The match was a huge success, and the T20I format quickly gained popularity around the world. The ICC established a separate format for T20Is, with a winner being declared after 20 overs. The T20I format has since been adopted by most countries, and it has become an integral part of international cricket.\n\n### Inaugural edition\n\nThe first ICC Men's T20 World Cup was held in 2007 in South Africa. The tournament was called the ICC World Twenty20, and it featured 12 teams from around the world. The West Indies won the inaugural tournament, defeating India in the final by five runs.\n\n### Expansion to 16 teams\n\nThe 2010 ICC World Twenty20 was held in the West Indies, and it featured 12 teams. The tournament was a huge success, and the ICC decided to expand the tournament to 16 teams for the 2012 edition.\n\n### Expansion to 20 teams\n\nThe 2014 ICC World Twenty20 was held in Bangladesh, and it featured 16 teams. The tournament was a success, and the ICC decided to expand the tournament to 20 teams for the 2016 edition.\n\n**Hosts**\n\nThe ICC Men's T20 World Cup has been hosted by various countries over the years. The hosts have included:\n\n* 2007: South Africa\n* 2009: England\n* 2010: West Indies\n* 2012: Sri Lanka\n* 2014: Bangladesh\n* 2016: India\n* 2021: United Arab Emirates and Oman (due to the COVID-19 pandemic)\n\n**Formats**\n\n### Qualification\n\nThe qualification process for the ICC Men's T20 World Cup involves a series of tournaments and matches played by teams around the world. The top teams from each region qualify for the tournament, with the top teams from the ICC's Super League qualifying automatically.\n\n### Final tournament\n\nThe final tournament features 20 teams, divided into four groups of five teams each. The teams play a round-robin format, with the top two teams from each group qualifying for the knockout stage. The knockout stage features a semi-final and a final, with the winner being declared the champion.\n\n**Trophy**\n\nThe ICC Men's T20 World Cup trophy is called the ICC Men's T20 World Cup Trophy. The trophy is a gold-plated trophy with a globe on top, surrounded by a wreath of leaves. The trophy is awarded to the winner of the tournament, and it is one of the most prestigious trophies in international cricket.\n\n**Attendance**\n\nThe attendance at the ICC Men's T20 World Cup has been impressive over the years. The 2016 edition in India attracted a record attendance of over 600,000 fans, while the 2021 edition in the United Arab Emirates and Oman attracted over 400,000 fans.\n\n**Results**\n\nThe results of the ICC Men's T20 World Cup have been as follows:\n\n* 2007: West Indies won the inaugural tournament, defeating India in the final by five runs.\n* 2009: Pakistan won the tournament, defeating Sri Lanka in the final by eight wickets.\n* 2010: England won the tournament, defeating Australia in the final by seven wickets.\n* 2012: West Indies won the tournament, defeating Sri Lanka in the final by five wickets.\n* 2014: Sri Lanka won the tournament, defeating India in the final by six wickets.\n* 2016: West Indies won the tournament, defeating England in the final by four wickets.\n\n**Team performance**\n\nThe team performance at the ICC Men's T20 World Cup has been impressive over the years.

This article provides an overview of the global atmospheric and hydrological conditions that contributed to the formation of tropical cyclones in 2022, as well as a summary of the systems that formed in each basin.\n\n**Global Atmospheric and Hydrological Conditions**\n\nThe year 2022 saw a continuation of the La Niña event that began in 2020, which had a significant impact on global weather patterns. La Niña events are characterized by cooler-than-average sea surface temperatures in the eastern Pacific Ocean, which can lead to an increase in tropical cyclone activity in various regions.\n\n**Summary**\n\n### North Atlantic Ocean\n\nThe North Atlantic basin experienced an above-average hurricane season in 2022, with 19 named storms forming. This was due in part to the strong subtropical high pressure system that dominated the region, leading to favorable conditions for tropical cyclone formation.\n\n### Eastern & Central Pacific Ocean\n\nThe Eastern Pacific basin saw an average hurricane season in 2022, with 17 named storms forming. However, the basin experienced an above-average number of major hurricanes, with 7 systems reaching Category 3 strength or higher.\n\n### Western Pacific Ocean\n\nThe Western Pacific basin experienced a below-average typhoon season in 2022, with 18 named storms forming. This was due in part to the strong subtropical high pressure system that dominated the region, leading to unfavorable conditions for tropical cyclone formation.\n\n### North Indian Ocean\n\nThe North Indian Ocean basin experienced an average cyclone season in 2022, with 7 named storms forming. The basin saw significant activity in May, with 3 systems forming in quick succession.\n\n### South-West Indian Ocean\n\nThe South-West Indian Ocean basin experienced a below-average cyclone season in 2022, with 5 named storms forming. This was due in part to the strong subtropical high pressure system that dominated the region, leading to unfavorable conditions for tropical cyclone formation.\n\n#### January - June\n\nThe first half of the year saw relatively quiet conditions in the South-West Indian Ocean, with only 1 system forming in January and none in February or March. However, the basin experienced significant activity in April, with 2 systems forming.\n\n#### July - December\n\nThe second half of the year saw a slight increase in activity in the South-West Indian Ocean, with 2 systems forming in July and 1 in September.\n\n### Australian Region\n\nThe Australian Region experienced an above-average cyclone season in 2022, with 15 named storms forming. This was due in part to the strong subtropical high pressure system that dominated the region, leading to favorable conditions for tropical cyclone formation.\n\n#### January - June\n\nThe first half of the year saw relatively quiet conditions in the Australian Region, with only 3 systems forming in January and none in February or March. However, the region experienced significant activity in April, with 4 systems forming.\n\n#### July - December\n\nThe second half of the year saw a significant increase in activity in the Australian Region, with 6 systems forming in July and 4 in September.\n\n### South Pacific Ocean\n\nThe South Pacific Ocean basin experienced an average cyclone season in 2022, with 10 named storms forming.
