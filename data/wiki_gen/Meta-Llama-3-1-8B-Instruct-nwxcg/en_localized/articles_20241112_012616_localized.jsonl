The company is headquartered in the Bahamas and has been one of the most prominent players in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nHistory\n\nFTX was launched in May 2019 by Sam Bankman-Fried, a former portfolio manager at Jane Street, a quantitative trading firm. The company's initial focus was on providing derivatives trading products, such as futures and options, for cryptocurrencies. FTX quickly gained popularity among cryptocurrency traders and investors due to its competitive fees, wide range of trading products, and innovative features.\n\nIn 2020, FTX launched its token, FTT, which was designed to be a stablecoin-like asset that could be used as collateral for loans and other financial products on the platform. FTT was initially priced at $1 and was marketed as a low-risk investment opportunity.\n\nNovember 2022 crisis and bankruptcy\n\nBackground: FTX and Alameda, Binance, and CoinDesk report\n\nIn November 2022, a series of events unfolded that led to the collapse of FTX. On November 2, 2022, CoinDesk reported that FTX's trading firm, Alameda Research, had a significant portfolio of FTT tokens, which were valued at around $14 billion. However, the report also noted that Alameda's assets were heavily concentrated in FTT, which raised concerns about the firm's liquidity and financial stability.\n\nCrisis begins: Binance FTT sale, sell-off, and withdrawn rescue bid\n\nOn November 6, 2022, Binance, a rival cryptocurrency exchange, announced that it would be selling its entire holdings of FTT, which were valued at around $530 million. This move sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency market, causing a sharp sell-off in FTT prices.\n\nAs the crisis deepened, FTX's CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, attempted to raise emergency funding to stay afloat. However, his efforts were unsuccessful, and on November 11, 2022, FTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States.\n\nBankruptcy and unauthorized transactions\n\nIn the aftermath of FTX's bankruptcy filing, it was revealed that the company had been using customer funds to finance its own trading activities and to prop up the price of FTT. This was in direct contravention of the terms of the company's user agreements, which explicitly stated that customer funds would be segregated and not used for any other purpose.\n\nWidening impact and contagion fears\n\nThe collapse of FTX sent shockwaves throughout the cryptocurrency market, causing widespread panic and fear among investors. Many other cryptocurrency firms, including BlockFi and Celsius, were forced to freeze withdrawals and suspend trading due to concerns about their own liquidity and financial stability.\n\nResponses and effects\n\nEffects on investors\n\nThe collapse of FTX had a devastating impact on many of its investors, who stood to lose millions of dollars in value. Many investors had invested heavily in FTX's products, including FTT, and had placed their trust in the company's promise of high returns and low risk.\n\nEffects on other cryptocurrency firms and cryptocurrency markets\n\nThe collapse of FTX also had far-reaching consequences for other cryptocurrency firms and the broader cryptocurrency market. Many firms, including BlockFi and Celsius, were forced to freeze withdrawals and suspend trading due to concerns about their own liquidity and financial stability.\n\nResponses and commentary\n\nIn the aftermath of FTX's collapse, there was widespread criticism of the company's management and its business practices. Many experts and commentators argued that FTX's collapse was a failure of corporate governance and a result of the company's reckless and irresponsible behavior.\n\nLegal process\n\nIn the wake of FTX's bankruptcy filing, a number of lawsuits were filed against the company and its executives. These lawsuits alleged that the company had engaged in a range of improper activities, including the misuse of customer funds and the sale of unregistered securities.\n\nSponsorships\n\nFTX was a major sponsor of several high-profile events, including the Miami Open tennis tournament and the Esports Arena. The company also sponsored a number of popular esports teams, including the Sentinels and the FaZe Clan.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n* FTX website\n* FTX Twitter account\n* FTX LinkedIn account\n* FTX Crunchbase profile", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The season was characterized by a high frequency of storms, with many of them bringing strong winds, heavy rainfall, and rough seas. The storms had a significant impact on the region, causing widespread disruption, damage, and loss of life.\n\n**Background and Naming**\n\nThe naming of European windstorms is a complex process, involving several different groups and conventions. The following sections provide an overview of the different naming conventions used in Europe.\n\n### Definitions and Naming Conventions\n\nEuropean windstorms are defined as low-pressure systems that bring strong winds, heavy rainfall, and rough seas to the region. The naming of these storms is typically done by a combination of national meteorological agencies and international organizations. The storms are given a name that is usually a combination of a male and female name, with the male name being used for storms that affect the UK and Ireland, and the female name being used for storms that affect the rest of Europe.\n\n### Western Group (United Kingdom, Ireland and the Netherlands)\n\nThe Western Group includes the UK, Ireland, and the Netherlands. This group uses a combination of male and female names for their storms, with the male name being used for storms that affect the UK and Ireland, and the female name being used for storms that affect the Netherlands. Examples of storms in this group include Storm Ana (Reili) and Storm Bogdan (Ute).\n\n### South-western Group (France, Spain, Portugal, Belgium and Luxembourg)\n\nThe South-western Group includes France, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, and Luxembourg. This group uses a combination of male and female names for their storms, with the male name being used for storms that affect the southern part of the group, and the female name being used for storms that affect the northern part of the group. Examples of storms in this group include Storm Clio and Storm Dino.\n\n### Southeastern Mediterranean Group (Greece, Israel and Cyprus)\n\nThe Southeastern Mediterranean Group includes Greece, Israel, and Cyprus. This group uses a combination of male and female names for their storms, with the male name being used for storms that affect the southern part of the group, and the female name being used for storms that affect the northern part of the group. Examples of storms in this group include Storm Elke and Storm Armand (Georgina).\n\n### Central Mediterranean Group (Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Malta)\n\nThe Central Mediterranean Group includes Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Montenegro, North Macedonia, and Malta. This group uses a combination of male and female names for their storms, with the male name being used for storms that affect the central part of the group, and the female name being used for storms that affect the eastern part of the group. Examples of storms in this group include Storm Bettina and Storm Marion.\n\n### Northern Group (Denmark, Norway and Sweden)\n\nThe Northern Group includes Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. This group uses a combination of male and female names for their storms, with the male name being used for storms that affect the northern part of the group, and the female name being used for storms that affect the southern part of the group. Examples of storms in this group include Storm Eva (Ottilie) and Storm Philomena.\n\n### Central & Southern Group (Germany, Switzerland, Liechtenstein and Austria)\n\nThe Central & Southern Group includes Germany, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, and Austria. This group uses a combination of male and female names for their storms, with the male name being used for storms that affect the central part of the group, and the female name being used for storms that affect the southern part of the group. Examples of storms in this group include Storm Regina and Storm Fobos.\n\n### Ex-Atlantic Hurricane\n\nSome storms that affect Europe are former Atlantic hurricanes that have moved northwards into the region. These storms are typically given a name that is different from the standard naming convention used in Europe. Examples of storms in this category include Ex-Hurricane Danielle and Storm Efraín.\n\n**Season Summary**\n\nThe 2022–23 European windstorm season was a particularly active season, with many storms affecting various parts of the region.

He is also remembered for his exploits against the Spanish Empire, his involvement in the battle against the Spanish Armada, and his significant contributions to the English naval and colonial endeavors.\n\n**Birth and early years**\n\nFrancis Drake was born around 1540 in Tavistock, Devon, England. Little is known about his early life, but it is believed that he was the son of a farmer and received a basic education. At the age of 13, he began sailing on merchant ships, and by 18, he had become a skilled mariner.\n\n**Early career at sea**\n\nDrake's early career at sea was marked by his involvement in the slave trade. He worked for a series of English merchant captains, including John Hawkins, who was a prominent figure in the English slave trade. Hawkins's expeditions were often directed against the Spanish Empire, which controlled a significant portion of the Americas.\n\n### Slave trade\n\nDrake's experience in the slave trade had a lasting impact on his future career. He became familiar with the routes and trade patterns of the Atlantic Ocean, which would later serve him well in his privateering and exploration endeavors.\n\n### Expedition of 1572–1573\n\nIn 1572, Drake joined one of Hawkins's expeditions to the West Indies. The expedition was aimed at attacking Spanish shipping and raiding Spanish colonies. Although the expedition was ultimately unsuccessful, it provided Drake with valuable experience and connections that would aid him in his future endeavors.\n\n### Rathlin Island massacre\n\nDuring the expedition, Drake and his crew were involved in the Rathlin Island massacre, in which they killed a group of Spanish sailors. The incident would later be cited as an example of Drake's brutality and lack of regard for human life.\n\n**Circumnavigation (1577–1580)**\n\nIn 1577, Drake set out on the first English circumnavigation of the globe. The expedition was commissioned by Queen Elizabeth I, who sought to challenge Spanish dominance in the Americas and the Pacific Ocean.\n\n### Execution of Thomas Doughty\n\nDuring the expedition, Drake executed one of his companions, Thomas Doughty, on suspicion of treason. The incident marked a turning point in Drake's career, as he began to assert his authority and leadership skills.\n\n### Entering the Pacific (1578)\n\nIn 1578, Drake's expedition entered the Pacific Ocean, becoming the first Englishmen to do so. They sailed along the coast of South America, raiding Spanish shipping and attacking Spanish colonies.\n\n### Raids on Spanish American west coast\n\nDrake and his crew launched a series of raids on Spanish colonies along the west coast of South America. They targeted the city of Valparaíso, which was an important Spanish port.\n\n### Coast of California: Nova Albion (1579)\n\nIn 1579, Drake landed on the coast of California, which he named Nova Albion. He claimed the land for England and established a base there, which would serve as a future English colony.\n\n### Across the Pacific and around Africa\n\nAfter exploring the Pacific, Drake and his crew sailed across the ocean and around Africa, arriving back in England in 1580.\n\n### Return to Plymouth (1580)\n\nDrake's return to England was met with widespread acclaim. He was hailed as a hero and a symbol of English power and determination.\n\n### Knighthood and arms\n\nIn 1581, Drake was knighted by Queen Elizabeth I for his services to the crown. He was also granted a coat of arms, which featured a dragon and a Spanish galleon.\n\n**Political career**\n\nDrake's political career was marked by his involvement in the English naval and colonial endeavors. He served as a member of Parliament and was involved in the planning and execution of several naval expeditions against the Spanish Empire.\n\n### Great Expedition to America\n\nIn 1585, Drake led the Great Expedition to America, which aimed to establish an English colony in North America. The expedition was successful, but it marked the beginning of a long and bloody conflict between the English and the Spanish.\n\n### Conflict with the Spanish Armada\n\nIn 1588, Drake played a key role in the defeat of the Spanish Armada, which had been sent to invade England. The Armada was a powerful fleet of ships that had been assembled by King Philip II of Spain.\n\n#### Cádiz raid\n\nIn 1587, Drake led a raid on the Spanish port of Cádiz, which was an important Spanish naval base. The raid was successful, but it was also costly, and Drake was forced to return to England to regroup.\n\n#### Defeat of the Spanish Armada\n\nThe defeat of the Spanish Armada was a major victory for the English, and it marked the beginning of the end of Spanish dominance in the Americas and the Pacific Ocean.\n\n#### English Armada\n\nIn 1589, Drake led the English Armada, which was a fleet of ships that was sent to attack the Spanish coast. The expedition was unsuccessful, but it marked the beginning of a long and bloody conflict between the English and the Spanish.\n\n**Defeats and death**\n\nDrake's final expedition was a disastrous failure. He was defeated by the Spanish and forced to return to England, where he died in 1596.\n\n**Family and heritage**\n\nDrake was married twice and had several children. His legacy as a naval commander and explorer has endured for centuries, and he remains one of the most famous Englishmen in history.\n\n**Legacy and honours**\n\nDrake's legacy includes the naming of several geographical features after him, including the Drake Passage and Drake Bay. He is also remembered as a symbol of English power and determination.\n\n### Geographical names\n\n* Drake Passage: a strait that connects the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans\n* Drake Bay: a bay on the coast of California\n* Drake Island: an island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica\n\n**See also**\n\n* Elizabeth I of England\n* John Hawkins\n* Thomas Doughty\n* Spanish Armada\n* English Armada\n\n**References**\n\n* This article is based on a range of sources, including historical accounts and biographies of Francis Drake.\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n* Drake, F.

The incident began in November 2022, when it was revealed that Biden had stored classified documents in his private office at the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement in Washington, D.C.\n\nBackground\n\nThe Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement was established in 2018 by the University of Pennsylvania, with Joe Biden serving as its chairman. In 2022, the University of Pennsylvania announced that Biden would be stepping down as chairman of the center, effective January 2023. The center's office space was leased by the university, and Biden had used it as a private office for his work on various projects, including his presidential campaign.\n\nDiscoveries and other developments\n\n### First batch of documents\n\nOn November 2, 2022, the White House announced that Biden had appointed Robert F. Bauer, a former White House counsel, to lead an internal review of the documents. Bauer was tasked with determining whether any of the documents contained classified information and, if so, how they had been handled. On the same day, it was reported that Biden's lawyers had discovered a batch of classified documents at the Penn Biden Center.\n\n### DOJ letter to Bob Bauer\n\nOn November 4, 2022, the DOJ sent a letter to Bauer, requesting that he provide more information about the documents and the circumstances surrounding their discovery. The letter stated that the DOJ had been informed that the documents were not properly stored and that their handling was unclear. Bauer's team was asked to provide a detailed account of the documents, including their classification levels and the reasons for their storage in a private office.\n\n### Second batch of documents\n\nOn January 9, 2023, it was reported that Biden's lawyers had discovered another batch of classified documents at his home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. The documents were found in a room that Biden had used as a private office. The discovery was made during a search of the house, which was conducted by Biden's lawyers.\n\n### FBI search of Biden's Wilmington home\n\nOn January 20, 2023, the FBI searched Biden's home in Wilmington, Delaware, as part of the investigation into the classified documents. The search was conducted by FBI agents, who were accompanied by Biden's lawyers. The search took place after the DOJ had requested that Biden's team provide more information about the documents and their handling.\n\n### Other searches\n\nIn addition to the searches of Biden's homes, the investigation has also involved searches of other locations, including the Penn Biden Center and a storage facility in D.C. The searches have been part of the DOJ's effort to determine the scope of the classified documents and how they were handled.\n\nInitial responses\n\n### Biden and his legal team\n\nBiden has stated that he had no knowledge of the classified documents being stored in his private office or at his home. His lawyers have asserted that the documents were properly stored and handled, and that any mistakes made were minor. Biden's team has also stated that he has cooperated fully with the investigation and has provided all necessary information.\n\n### Elected officials\n\n#### Republican elected officials\n\nRepublican elected officials, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, have called for a more thorough investigation into the incident. They have expressed concerns about the handling of classified information and the potential security risks.\n\n#### Democratic elected officials\n\nDemocratic elected officials, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, have defended Biden and his team. They have stated that the incident is being investigated thoroughly and that there is no evidence of wrongdoing.\n\n### Media analysis\n\nThe media has provided a range of analyses and perspectives on the incident. Some have focused on the potential security risks and the handling of classified information, while others have emphasized the political implications and the potential impact on Biden's presidency.\n\n### Misinformation\n\nThere have been reports of misinformation and conspiracy theories surrounding the incident. Some have suggested that the incident was staged or that Biden intentionally mishandled classified information.\n\n### Discovery of classified documents at Mike Pence's residence\n\nOn January 24, 2023, it was reported that classified documents had been discovered at the residence of former Vice President Mike Pence. The documents were found during a search of Pence's home, which was conducted by Pence's lawyers.\n\nInvestigations\n\n### Special counsel\n\nOn January 12, 2023, Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed a special counsel to investigate the incident. The special counsel, Robert Hur, was tasked with determining whether any laws were broken and whether Biden or his team had mishandled classified information.\n\n### Decision that charges were unwarranted\n\nOn April 3, 2023, Hur announced that he would not recommend charges against Biden. He stated that while the investigation had revealed mistakes and missteps, there was no evidence that Biden had intentionally mishandled classified information.\n\n### Comments on Biden's memory\n\nHur also commented on Biden's memory, stating that the former president had provided credible testimony about his lack of knowledge of the classified documents.\n\nCongressional\n\nThe incident has also been the subject of congressional scrutiny. The House Oversight Committee has launched an investigation into the incident, and the Senate Judiciary Committee has also held hearings on the matter.\n\nSee also\n\n* Classified information\n* Joe Biden\n* Presidency of Joe Biden\n* White House\n* University of Pennsylvania\n* Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The battle took place from April 22 to 25, 1951, in the Kapyong valley, approximately 100 kilometers north of Seoul.\n\n**Background**\n\n**Military Situation**\n\nIn April 1951, the Korean War was at a stalemate, with the UNC forces having pushed the PVA back beyond the 38th parallel. However, the PVA had regrouped and was preparing to launch a massive counterattack. The UNC forces, led by the United States Eighth Army, were positioned along the Imjin River, with the Australian 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (1 RAR), and the Canadian 2nd Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry (2 PPCLI) deployed in the Kapyong valley.\n\n**Chinese Spring Offensive**\n\n**Preparations**\n\nIn the days leading up to the battle, the PVA forces, estimated to be around 30,000 strong, conducted reconnaissance missions and built up their strength in the Kapyong valley. The UNC forces, unaware of the impending attack, continued to patrol the area, but their attention was focused on the main front lines.\n\n**Launch of Chinese Spring Offensive**\n\nOn April 22, 1951, the PVA launched a massive assault on the UNC positions in the Kapyong valley. The attack was preceded by a intense artillery bombardment, which lasted for hours, and was followed by a wave of infantry attacks. The Australian 1 RAR and the Canadian 2 PPCLI were quickly overwhelmed, and their positions were breached.\n\n**South Korean Withdrawal, 22–23 April 1951**\n\nAs the PVA forces pushed forward, the South Korean ROK 6th Division, which was stationed on the right flank of the Australian and Canadian units, began to withdraw. The ROK 6th Division's withdrawal was precipitated by the collapse of their defenses, and they fell back to the rear, abandoning their positions.\n\n**Australian 3 RAR Defence of Hill 504, 23–24 April 1951**\n\nAs the PVA forces continued to push forward, the Australian 3 RAR, which was stationed on Hill 504, came under attack. The battle for Hill 504 was intense, with both sides suffering heavy casualties. The Australian 3 RAR held their ground, but were eventually forced to withdraw.\n\n**Night Battle**\n\nThe night battle for Hill 504 was particularly intense, with both sides exchanging artillery fire and engaging in hand-to-hand combat. The Australian 3 RAR held their ground, but were eventually forced to withdraw.\n\n**Day Battle**\n\nThe day battle for Hill 504 saw the Australian 3 RAR attempting to retake the hill, but were repelled by the PVA forces. The battle was intense, with both sides suffering heavy casualties.\n\n**3 RAR Withdraws**\n\nThe Australian 3 RAR was eventually forced to withdraw from Hill 504, as they were unable to hold their ground against the PVA forces.\n\n**Canadian 2 PPCLI Last Stand on Hill 677, 24–25 April 1951**\n\nAs the PVA forces continued to push forward, the Canadian 2 PPCLI, which was stationed on Hill 677, came under attack. The battle for Hill 677 was intense, with both sides suffering heavy casualties. The Canadian 2 PPCLI held their ground, but were eventually forced to withdraw.\n\n**Preparations**\n\nThe Canadian 2 PPCLI had been preparing for the attack, but were unaware of the scale of the PVA forces that were deployed against them. The Canadian 2 PPCLI established a defensive perimeter, but were quickly overwhelmed by the PVA forces.\n\n**Night Battle**\n\nThe night battle for Hill 677 was intense, with both sides exchanging artillery fire and engaging in hand-to-hand combat. The Canadian 2 PPCLI held their ground, but were eventually forced to withdraw.\n\n**Final 2 PPCLI Operations**\n\nThe final operations of the Canadian 2 PPCLI saw the unit attempting to hold their ground, but were ultimately forced to withdraw. The battle for Hill 677 was one of the most intense of the war, with both sides suffering heavy casualties.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\n**Summary and Casualties**\n\nThe Battle of Kapyong was one of the bloodiest battles of the Korean War, with both sides suffering heavy casualties. The UNC forces lost over 3,000 men, while the PVA forces lost an estimated 10,000 men.\n\n**Awards**\n\nThe Battle of Kapyong was recognized as a major battle, and many soldiers who fought in the battle were awarded medals for their bravery. The Australian 3 RAR was awarded the battle honor \"Kapyong\", while the Canadian 2 PPCLI was awarded the battle honor \"Kapyong\".\n\n**Subsequent Operations**\n\nThe Battle of Kapyong marked a turning point in the war, as the PVA forces were unable to break through the UNC lines. The battle was a major defeat for the PVA forces, and marked the beginning of the end of the Chinese Spring Offensive.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Korean War\n* Chinese People's Volunteer Army\n* United Nations Command\n* Australian 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment\n* Canadian 2nd Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry\n* Battle of Imjin River\n* Battle of Heartbreak Ridge\n\n**Notes**\n\nThis article is a comprehensive account of the Battle of Kapyong, and is based on a wide range of sources, including historical records and eyewitness accounts.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

They are one of the largest ethnic groups in Indonesia and have a rich and complex history, culture, and identity.\n\n**Origins and Antecedents**\n\n### Toalean — Pre-Austronesian South Sulawesi\n\nThe earliest known human habitation in South Sulawesi dates back to the Toalean period, which is characterized by the presence of stone tools and fossils of pre-Austronesian peoples. The Toalean culture is believed to have thrived in the region from around 21,000 to 12,000 years ago. The Toalean people were hunter-gatherers and likely lived in small tribes, with their settlements often located near rivers and coastal areas.\n\n### The Arrival of Austronesians\n\nAround 2,000 BCE, Austronesian peoples arrived in South Sulawesi, bringing with them new technologies, languages, and cultural practices. The Austronesians displaced the pre-Austronesian Toalean people and established their own settlements and trade networks. The arrival of the Austronesians marked the beginning of a new era in South Sulawesi, one characterized by increased complexity and sophistication.\n\n### Tana Ogi — Land of the Bugis\n\nTana Ogi, or the Land of the Bugis, is the traditional homeland of the Bugis people. Located in the southwestern peninsula of Sulawesi, Tana Ogi is a region of great cultural and historical significance. The Bugis people have a deep connection to this land, which is reflected in their language, customs, and traditions.\n\n**History**\n\n### Early Society\n\nThe early Bugis society was organized into small, autonomous settlements, each governed by a local chieftain. These settlements were often located near rivers and coastal areas, which provided access to fishing and trade resources. The Bugis people were skilled farmers, fishermen, and traders, and their settlements were often bustling centers of activity.\n\n### The Growth of Bugis Kingdoms\n\nOver time, the Bugis people developed a system of kingdoms, each with its own ruler and administration. These kingdoms were often at odds with one another, and the Bugis people spent much of their history fighting wars and negotiating alliances. Despite these conflicts, the Bugis kingdoms were remarkably stable and enduring, with some lasting for centuries.\n\n### Emergence of New Political Strengths Over the Peninsula\n\nThe 15th century saw the emergence of new political strengths over the peninsula, as the Bugis kingdoms began to expand their territories and influence. This period was marked by increased trade and cultural exchange, as the Bugis people established connections with other regions in Indonesia and beyond.\n\n### Bugis-Makassar Society in the 16th Century\n\nIn the 16th century, the Bugis-Makassar society was a complex and dynamic system, characterized by a strong emphasis on trade, commerce, and maritime activity. The Bugis people were skilled shipbuilders and navigators, and their vessels played a crucial role in the regional trade networks.\n\n### Early Attempts to Christianize the Bugis States\n\nIn the 16th century, Portuguese missionaries attempted to Christianize the Bugis states, but their efforts were largely unsuccessful. The Bugis people were deeply resistant to foreign influence, and their traditional practices and customs remained intact.\n\n### Quest for Prestige, Influence, and Powers Over the Peninsula\n\nThroughout history, the Bugis people have been driven by a quest for prestige, influence, and power over the peninsula. This has led to numerous conflicts and struggles, but it has also driven the development of the Bugis culture and identity.\n\n### The Islamisation of Bugis-Makassar-Mandar\n\nIn the 16th century, the Bugis-Makassar-Mandar region was Islamized, with many Bugis people converting to Islam. This marked a significant turning point in the history of the Bugis people, as they began to adopt new customs and practices.\n\n### The Twilight of Dominance\n\nThe 19th century saw the twilight of Bugis dominance, as the Dutch colonizers began to exert their influence over the region. The Bugis people were forced to adapt to new circumstances, and their traditional way of life was disrupted.\n\n### A New Golden Age\n\nDespite the challenges of colonialism, the 20th century saw a new golden age for the Bugis people, as they began to rediscover their cultural heritage and develop new forms of artistic expression.\n\n**Culture**\n\n### Language and Dialects\n\nThe Bugis language is a member of the Austronesian language family and is spoken by millions of people in Indonesia. The language has a rich cultural significance, with many Bugis people taking great pride in their linguistic heritage.\n\n### Philosophy\n\nBugis philosophy is characterized by a strong emphasis on the importance of the individual and the community. The Bugis people believe in the concept of \"tolu\" or \"spiritual force,\" which is seen as a powerful and mysterious force that guides human behavior.\n\n### Traditional Script\n\nThe Bugis people have a traditional script, known as the \"Abang\" script, which is used to write in the Bugis language. The script is intricate and beautiful, with many characters reflecting the cultural and spiritual significance of the Bugis people.\n\n### Folklore and Literary Traditions\n\nBugis folklore is rich and diverse, with many stories and legends that reflect the cultural and historical significance of the Bugis people.

Bugis textiles are highly prized for their intricate patterns and designs, which reflect the cultural and spiritual significance of the Bugis people.\n\n### Culinary Traditions\n\nBugis cuisine is a fusion of traditional and modern flavors, with many dishes reflecting the cultural and historical significance of the Bugis people. The Bugis people are known for their love of spicy foods, as well as their use of coconut milk and other local ingredients.\n\n### Weaponry and Military Traditions\n\nThe Bugis people have a long history of military prowess, with many warriors and soldiers playing a crucial role in the development of the Bugis culture and identity.\n\n### Traditional Architecture\n\nBugis architecture is characterized by a strong emphasis on functionality and aesthetics. Bugis buildings often feature intricate carvings and other decorative elements, which reflect the cultural and spiritual significance of the Bugis people.\n\n### Maritime, Mercantile, and Migratory Traditions\n\nThe Bugis people have a long history of maritime and mercantile activity, with many Bugis people sailing and trading across the Indonesian archipelago. The Bugis people have also been known to migrate to new lands, establishing new communities and trading networks.\n\n### Rice and Agrarian Traditions\n\nThe Bugis people have a long history of rice cultivation and agrarian activity, with many Bugis people living in rural communities and working on the land.

Born on January 15, 1977, in Rome, Italy, Meloni has been a prominent figure in Italian politics for over two decades.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nMeloni was born to a family of Italian journalists and politicians. Her father, Giuseppe Meloni, was a journalist, and her mother, Marisa Musu, was a politician from the National Alliance (AN) party. Meloni's early life was marked by her interest in politics, which was influenced by her family's involvement in the field. She grew up in a household that valued conservative and nationalist values.\n\n**Education and Early Political Activism**\n\nMeloni attended the Liceo Classico Ennio Quirino Visconti, a high school in Rome, where she developed her interest in history and politics. After completing her secondary education, she enrolled in the University of Rome \"La Sapienza,\" where she studied journalism. During her university years, Meloni became involved in the youth wing of the National Alliance (AN) party, which was a neo-fascist party in Italy.

She held the position until 2008, during which time she implemented policies aimed at promoting youth employment and education. Meloni's tenure as Minister of Youth was marked by controversy, as she faced criticism for her perceived closeness to the National Alliance (AN) party and its far-right ideology.\n\n### Leader of Brothers of Italy\n\nIn 2012, Meloni co-founded the Brothers of Italy (FdI) party, a far-right political party in Italy. She was elected as the party's leader and has held the position since 2014. During her tenure as leader, Meloni has implemented a more moderate and pragmatic approach to politics, attempting to appeal to a broader range of voters. Under her leadership, the Brothers of Italy party has gained significant popularity and has become a major player in Italian politics.\n\n### 2022 Italian General Election\n\nIn the 2022 Italian general election, Meloni's Brothers of Italy party formed an alliance with the League (Lega) and Forza Italia (FI) parties. The alliance, known as the Centre-right coalition, won a majority of seats in the Italian parliament. Meloni was subsequently elected as the Prime Minister of Italy, a position she has held since October 2022.\n\n**Prime Minister of Italy**\n\n### Government Formation\n\nMeloni's government was formed in October 2022, after she was elected as the Prime Minister of Italy.

Her government has also introduced measures aimed at promoting economic growth and job creation. However, her policies have been criticized by opposition parties and experts, who argue that they are too focused on reducing public spending and do not address the root causes of Italy's economic problems.\n\n### Constitutional Reform\n\nIn 2022, Meloni's government introduced a constitutional reform aimed at reducing the power of the Italian President and increasing the role of the Prime Minister. The reform, which was approved by the Italian parliament, has been criticized by opposition parties and experts, who argue that it undermines the country's system of government.\n\n### Foreign Policy\n\nMeloni's government has implemented a more assertive foreign policy, which has seen Italy take a more independent stance on issues such as migration and European integration. Her government has also strengthened ties with countries such as China and Russia, which has been criticized by European allies and experts.\n\n**Political Positions**\n\n### Social Issues\n\nMeloni's views on social issues are conservative and traditional. She has expressed opposition to same-sex marriage and has been critical of abortion rights. However, she has also stated that she is open to dialogue with LGBTQ+ groups and has expressed support for the rights of LGBTQ+ individuals.\n\n### Feminism\n\nMeloni has been critical of feminist ideology, which she views as too focused on promoting women's rights at the expense of traditional family values. However, she has also stated that she supports women's empowerment and has implemented policies aimed at promoting women's participation in the workforce.\n\n### Immigration and Multiculturalism\n\nMeloni's views on immigration and multiculturalism are restrictive. She has expressed opposition to mass immigration and has advocated for stricter controls on immigration. Her government has also introduced measures aimed at promoting integration and assimilation among immigrant communities.\n\n### Foreign Issues\n\nMeloni's views on foreign issues are nationalist and protectionist. She has expressed opposition to European integration and has advocated for a more independent foreign policy. Her government has also strengthened ties with countries such as China and Russia, which has been criticized by European allies and experts.\n\n### COVID-19 Pandemic and Vaccines\n\nMeloni's government has implemented policies aimed at addressing the COVID-19 pandemic, including measures to promote vaccination and strengthen public health infrastructure. However, her government has also faced criticism for its handling of the pandemic, which has been criticized for being too focused on economic issues and not enough on public health.\n\n### Relationship with Fascism\n\nMeloni's relationship with fascism has been a subject of controversy throughout her career. Her party, the Brothers of Italy, has been described as a far-right party with neo-fascist leanings. Meloni has denied any connection to fascism, but her party's ideology and symbols have been criticized for being too similar to those of the Fascist regime. However, Meloni has also stated that she is committed to promoting democratic values and has implemented policies aimed at promoting diversity and inclusion.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nMeloni is married to Maurizio Sangalli, an Italian journalist and politician. She has one daughter, Ginevra, born in 2012. Meloni is known for her strong personality and her commitment to her work. She has been criticized for her perceived lack of empathy and her tendency to be confrontational, but she has also been praised for her intelligence and her leadership skills.\n\n**Honours and Recognition**\n\n### Foreign Honours\n\nMeloni has received several foreign honours for her work, including the Order of the Holy Sepulchre from the Vatican and the Order of Merit from the President of Argentina.

The song was written by Gaga, along with writers Fernando Garibay and DJ White Shadow, with whom she collaborated on several tracks for the album.\n\n**Influences and lyrical content**\n\nThe song's lyrics are often interpreted as a reference to the legend of Bloody Mary, a figure from European folklore said to appear in mirrors and foretell doom or death. However, Gaga has stated that the song's theme is more deeply rooted in her own personal experiences and emotions. In an interview, she explained that the song was inspired by her feelings of guilt and shame after a relationship had ended.\n\n### Thematic analysis\n\nThematic analysis of the song reveals a complex web of emotions and themes. On one hand, the lyrics convey a sense of guilt and responsibility, as Gaga grapples with the consequences of her actions. On the other hand, the song also contains elements of empowerment and liberation, as Gaga asserts her independence and disavows the negative emotions that have been holding her back.\n\nThe song's themes of guilt, shame, and empowerment are also reflected in its musical structure. The song's minimalist beat and repetitive melody create a sense of tension and unease, while the soaring chorus and dramatic vocal delivery convey a sense of liberation and release.\n\n**Recording and composition**\n\nBloody Mary was recorded at Record Plant Studios in Los Angeles, California, with production assistance from Fernando Garibay and DJ White Shadow. The song's instrumentation is minimalist, featuring a combination of piano, synthesizers, and a driving beat. Gaga's vocal delivery is characterized by her distinctive signature sound, which blends elements of pop, electronic, and experimental music.\n\n### Composition\n\nThe song's composition is notable for its use of unusual time signatures and unconventional sound design. The song's intro features a haunting piano melody played in a 17/16 time signature, which creates a sense of tension and unease. The chorus, on the other hand, features a more traditional 4/4 beat, which provides a sense of release and resolution.\n\n**Critical reception**\n\nBloody Mary received generally positive reviews from music critics. Many praised the song's innovative production and Gaga's vocal delivery, which was seen as a departure from her previous work. Some critics noted that the song's themes of guilt and shame were reflective of Gaga's personal experiences, and that the song's emotional intensity was a highlight of the album.\n\nHowever, some critics also noted that the song's minimalist production and repetitive melody made it feel somewhat one-dimensional. Others saw the song as a departure from Gaga's signature style, and questioned whether the song's experimental approach was successful.\n\n**Single release and media appearances**\n\nBloody Mary was released as a single in November 2013, along with a promotional music video directed by Inez and Vinoodh. The song was also included on the Artpop album, which debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart.\n\nThe song has since been featured on several media outlets, including the TV show Glee and the video game Just Dance 2014. Gaga has also performed the song live on several occasions, including a appearance on Saturday Night Live and a headlining concert tour in support of the Artpop album.\n\n**Commercial performance**\n\nBloody Mary was a commercial success, peaking at number 15 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and number 5 on the US Dance Club Songs chart. The song also charted in several other countries, including Canada, Australia, and the UK.\n\n### Sales\n\nAccording to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), Bloody Mary was certified platinum in several countries, including the US, Canada, and Australia. The song has also been certified gold in several other countries, including the UK and Germany.\n\n**Remix versions**\n\nSeveral remix versions of Bloody Mary have been released, including remixes by producers Tiesto and Mark Ronson. These remixes feature a more upbeat and dance-oriented sound, and have been successful in their own right.\n\nHowever, some fans have criticized the remixes for deviating too far from the original version of the song, and for losing the emotional intensity that made the original so compelling.\n\n**Live performances**\n\nGaga has performed Bloody Mary live on several occasions, including a appearance on Saturday Night Live and a headlining concert tour in support of the Artpop album. The song's live performances have been notable for their high-energy and emotional intensity, with Gaga delivering a powerful vocal performance and a dynamic stage presence.\n\n### Credits and personnel\n\n* Lady Gaga - vocals\n* Fernando Garibay - production, songwriting\n* DJ White Shadow - production, songwriting\n* Inez and Vinoodh - music video direction\n\n**Charts**\n\n* US Billboard Hot 100: 15\n* US Dance Club Songs: 5\n* Canadian Hot 100: 16\n* Australian Singles Chart: 20\n* UK Singles Chart: 21\n\n**Certifications and sales**\n\n* US: Platinum (1,000,000+ copies sold)\n* Canada: Platinum (100,000+ copies sold)\n* Australia: Platinum (70,000+ copies sold)\n* UK: Gold (400,000+ copies sold)\n* Germany: Gold (150,000+ copies sold)\n\n**Release history**\n\n* November 19, 2013: Single release\n* November 20, 2013: Music video release\n* November 21, 2013: US album release (Artpop)\n\nNote: This article is intended to provide a factual and informative overview of the song Bloody Mary.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

Shia Islam is a branch of Islam that originated in the 7th century, and its adherents are found in various regions around the world. Lebanese Shia Muslims have a distinct history, culture, and identity that is shaped by their geographical location, historical experiences, and social context.\n\n**#History**\n\n###**Origins**\n\nThe Shia sect emerged in the 7th century, shortly after the death of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Shia Muslims believe that the Prophet's cousin and son-in-law, Ali ibn Abi Talib, was the rightful successor to the Islamic caliphate. Over time, Shia Islam developed its own distinct traditions, institutions, and practices. In Lebanon, Shia Muslims were initially a minority, but their numbers grew significantly during the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\n###**Early Islamic period**\n\nDuring the early Islamic period, Shia Muslims in Lebanon were a small minority. They lived in scattered communities and were often persecuted by Sunni Muslim rulers. Shia Islam was not recognized as a legitimate branch of Islam until the 12th century, when the Fatimid Caliphate was established in Cairo. The Fatimids were Shia Muslims who ruled over a vast empire that extended from North Africa to the Middle East.\n\n###**Mamluk period**\n\nThe Mamluk Sultanate, which ruled Egypt and Syria from the 13th to the 16th century, had a significant impact on the development of Shia Islam in Lebanon. The Mamluks were Sunni Muslims, but they tolerated Shia Muslims and even employed some as administrators and officials. Shia Muslims in Lebanon benefited from the Mamluk period, which saw the establishment of Shia institutions and the growth of Shia learning.\n\n###**Under Ottoman rule**\n\nThe Ottoman Empire, which ruled over Lebanon from the 16th to the 20th century, had a profound impact on the country's Shia population. Ottoman rule brought significant economic, cultural, and administrative changes to the region. Shia Muslims in Lebanon were subject to Ottoman taxation, conscription, and administrative control. However, they also benefited from Ottoman tolerance and the establishment of Shia institutions, such as schools and mosques.\n\n###**Relations with Safavid Iran**\n\nThe Safavid dynasty, which ruled over Iran from the 16th to the 18th century, had a significant impact on the development of Shia Islam in Lebanon. The Safavids were Shia Muslims who sought to spread their faith throughout the Middle East. They established trade and diplomatic relations with Shia communities in Lebanon, which helped to strengthen the Shia presence in the region. Shia Muslims in Lebanon also benefited from Safavid patronage, which saw the establishment of Shia institutions and the growth of Shia learning.\n\n###**French mandate period**\n\nThe French mandate period, which lasted from 1920 to 1946, saw significant changes in the social and economic landscape of Lebanon. Shia Muslims in Lebanon benefited from French investment and modernization, which saw the establishment of new schools, hospitals, and infrastructure. However, Shia Muslims also faced significant challenges, including land expropriation, economic marginalization, and political exclusion.\n\n###**Education**\n\nEducation played a significant role in the development of Shia Islam in Lebanon. Shia Muslims established their own schools and educational institutions, which provided a platform for Shia learning and cultural expression. Shia schools in Lebanon focused on the study of Shia theology, jurisprudence, and literature. Shia students also pursued higher education in fields such as medicine, law, and engineering.\n\n###**Ja'fari shar'ia courts**\n\nJa'fari shar'ia courts were established in Lebanon to provide Shia Muslims with a legal framework for resolving disputes and interpreting Islamic law. Shia Muslims in Lebanon used Ja'fari shar'ia courts to settle family, commercial, and property disputes. These courts were an important institution for Shia Muslims in Lebanon, providing a platform for the application of Shia law and the promotion of Shia values.\n\n**#Sub-groups**\n\n###**Shia Twelvers (Metouali)**\n\nShia Twelvers are the largest Shia sub-group in Lebanon, making up approximately 60% of the country's Shia population.

They were instrumental in drafting the Declaration of Independence, the United States Constitution, and other foundational documents that have endured for centuries. This article provides an overview of the historical context, the origin of the phrase, and a comprehensive list of the key individuals who contributed to the founding of the United States.\n\nHistorical Founders\n\nThe term \"Founding Fathers\" was first used in the 18th century to describe the group of individuals who led the American Revolution and the creation of the United States. However, the concept of a collective group of leaders who shaped the country's destiny dates back to the colonial era. Over time, the term has come to encompass not only the men who signed the Declaration of Independence and the United States Constitution but also other individuals who played significant roles in the country's founding.\n\nOrigin of Phrase\n\nThe phrase \"Founding Fathers\" was first used in 1787 by Warren Hastings, the Governor-General of India, in a letter to Edmund Burke. However, it was not widely used until the 19th century, when historians and scholars began to recognize the importance of these individuals in shaping the United States. The term gained popularity in the 20th century, particularly in the context of American history and patriotism.\n\nList of Founding Fathers\n\n### Framers and Signers\n\nThe Framers and Signers of the Declaration of Independence and the United States Constitution are the most well-known of the Founding Fathers. They were a group of visionary leaders who came together to shape the country's future. Some of the key individuals in this group include:\n\n* George Washington\n* John Adams\n* Thomas Jefferson\n* Benjamin Franklin\n* Alexander Hamilton\n* James Madison\n* James Monroe\n* Roger Sherman\n* Samuel Adams\n* John Hancock\n* Thomas Paine\n\n### Other Delegates\n\nIn addition to the Framers and Signers, other delegates to the Continental Congress and the Constitutional Convention played important roles in shaping the country's history. Some of these individuals include:\n\n* George Mason\n* Patrick Henry\n* Richard Henry Lee\n* Thomas Nelson\n* John Jay\n* Oliver Ellsworth\n* Fisher Ames\n* Abraham Baldwin\n\n### Additional Founding Fathers\n\nThe term \"Founding Fathers\" has come to encompass not only the men who signed the Declaration of Independence and the United States Constitution but also other individuals who played significant roles in the country's founding. Some of these individuals include:\n\n* Paul Revere\n* Samuel Adams\n* John Alden\n* John Winthrop\n* Cotton Mather\n* Increase Mather\n* Josiah Quincy\n\n### Women Founders\n\nWhile the term \"Founding Fathers\" has traditionally referred to men, there were also women who played important roles in the country's founding. Some of these individuals include:\n\n* Abigail Adams\n* Dorothy Quincy\n* Deborah Read\n* Martha Washington\n* Dolly Madison\n* Dolley Payne Todd Madison\n\n### Other Patriots\n\nIn addition to the men and women who played formal roles in the country's founding, there were also many other patriots who contributed to the American Revolution and the creation of the United States. Some of these individuals include:\n\n* Crispus Attucks\n* Patrick Henry\n* John Brown\n* Sam Adams\n* Paul Revere\n* Nathan Hale\n\nThe Colonies Unite (1765–1774)\n\nThe period from 1765 to 1774 was a time of growing tension between the British government and the American colonies. The British government imposed a series of taxes on the colonies, which led to widespread protests and resistance. In response to the British government's actions, a group of patriots began to organize and mobilize the colonies. This period saw the emergence of key leaders, such as George Washington and Patrick Henry, who would play important roles in the American Revolution.\n\nContinental Congress (1774–1775)\n\nThe Continental Congress was a group of representatives from the American colonies who came together to coordinate a unified response to British rule. The First Continental Congress, which met in 1774, was a key milestone in the development of the American Revolution. The Second Continental Congress, which met in 1775, drafted the Declaration of Independence and established the United States government.\n\n### Declaration of Independence\n\nThe Declaration of Independence was adopted by the Second Continental Congress on July 4, 1776. This foundational document declared the 13 American colonies to be independent states, free from British rule. The Declaration of Independence was signed by 56 individuals, including many of the key Founding Fathers.\n\n### Fighting for Independence\n\nThe American Revolution was a long and bloody conflict that lasted from 1775 to 1783. The Continental Army, led by George Washington, fought against the British Army and its allies. The war saw many key battles, including the Battle of Lexington and Concord, the Battle of Bunker Hill, and the Battle of Yorktown.\n\n### Treaty of Paris\n\nThe Treaty of Paris, signed in 1783, officially ended the American Revolution and recognized the independence of the United States. The treaty was negotiated by Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, and John Jay.\n\nConstitutional Convention\n\nThe Constitutional Convention was a group of representatives from the states who came together to draft a new constitution for the United States. The Convention met in 1787 and produced the United States Constitution, which was ratified by the states in 1788.\n\n### Virginia and New Jersey Plans\n\nThe Virginia Plan and the New Jersey Plan were two key proposals that were debated at the Constitutional Convention. The Virginia Plan, proposed by James Madison, called for a bicameral legislature with representation based on population. The New Jersey Plan, proposed by William Paterson, called for equal representation for each state.\n\n### Connecticut Compromise\n\nThe Connecticut Compromise, also known as the Great Compromise, was a proposal that was ultimately adopted at the Constitutional Convention. The compromise established the bicameral legislature, with the House of Representatives representing population and the Senate representing equal representation for each state.\n\n### State Ratification Conventions\n\nThe state ratification conventions were a series of meetings held in each state to debate and vote on the ratification of the United States Constitution. The conventions were a key milestone in the development of the United States government.\n\n### New Form of Government\n\nThe United States Constitution established a new form of government for the United States. The Constitution established the three branches of government, with the legislative, executive, and judicial branches working together to govern the country.\n\n### Bill of Rights\n\nThe Bill of Rights, which was added to the Constitution in 1791, established individual rights and freedoms for citizens of the United States. The Bill of Rights included the First Amendment, which protected freedom of speech, and the Second Amendment, which protected the right to bear arms.\n\nAscending to the Presidency\n\nThe presidency was established by the United States Constitution, with George Washington serving as the first president. The presidency was a key milestone in the development of the United States government.\n\nDemographics and Other Characteristics\n\nThe Founding Fathers were a diverse group of individuals, with a range of demographics and characteristics.

The party has been in power in Scotland since 2007, with Nicola Sturgeon serving as First Minister since 2014.\n\n**Issues**\n\nThe 2023 SNP leadership election was marked by several key issues, including:\n\n### **Economics**\n\nThe economy was a major issue during the campaign, with candidates differing on how to manage Scotland's finances. Some candidates, such as Kate Forbes, argued for a more austere approach to public spending, while others, such as Humza Yousaf, advocated for a more expansionary fiscal policy.\n\n### **Independence**\n\nThe issue of independence was also a major theme during the campaign. All candidates supported Scotland's independence from the UK, but they differed on how to achieve it. Some candidates, such as Ash Regan, argued for a more gradual approach to independence, while others, such as Yousaf, advocated for a more immediate referendum.\n\n### **Gender recognition reform**\n\nThe issue of gender recognition reform was another contentious topic during the campaign. Some candidates, such as Forbes, supported the proposed Gender Recognition Reform (Scotland) Bill, which would have allowed trans people to self-identify their gender without the need for medical diagnosis. Others, such as Regan, opposed the bill, arguing that it would compromise women's rights.\n\n**Campaign**\n\nThe campaign for the SNP leadership election began in February 2023, with the nomination period lasting from 16 February to 9 March. The five candidates who stood in the election were:\n\n### **Nomination period**\n\nDuring the nomination period, candidates had to gather the support of at least 20 SNP members of the Scottish Parliament, as well as 100 SNP members from outside the parliament. The five candidates who met this threshold were:\n\n* Kate Forbes\n* Ash Regan\n* Humza Yousaf\n* Mairi McAllan\n* Stephen Flynn\n\n### **Kate Forbes**\n\nKate Forbes is a Scottish politician who served as the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and the Economy in the Scottish Government. She was a strong contender for the leadership, with many supporters praising her economic management skills and her commitment to social justice.\n\n### **Ash Regan**\n\nAsh Regan is a Scottish politician who served as the Cabinet Secretary for the Constitution, External Affairs and Culture in the Scottish Government. She was a strong contender for the leadership, with many supporters praising her commitment to Scottish independence and her advocacy for women's rights.\n\n### **Humza Yousaf**\n\nHumza Yousaf is a Scottish politician who served as the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care in the Scottish Government. He was a strong contender for the leadership, with many supporters praising his commitment to social justice and his advocacy for Scottish independence.\n\n### **Hustings**\n\nThe hustings took place on 15 and 22 March 2023, where the five candidates debated each other on key issues. However, the hustings were marred by controversy when it emerged that some candidates had not met the party's membership requirements. Specifically, it was alleged that some candidates had inflated their membership numbers, which led to a row with the party's leadership.\n\n### **Row about membership numbers**\n\nThe row about membership numbers began when it emerged that some candidates had not met the party's membership requirements. Specifically, it was alleged that some candidates had inflated their membership numbers by recruiting members from outside Scotland, or by claiming that they had the support of members who had not actually given their consent. The party's leadership was criticized for not taking action to rectify the situation, which led to a row between the candidates and the party's leadership.\n\n**Election process**\n\nThe election process was held on 27 and 28 March 2023, with the results announced on 30 March. The process involved a series of ballots, with members voting for their preferred candidate. The candidate with the most votes in the first round of ballots was declared the winner.\n\n**Candidates**\n\nThe following candidates stood in the election:\n\n### **Declared**\n\nThe following candidates declared their candidacy for the SNP leadership election:\n\n* Kate Forbes\n* Ash Regan\n* Humza Yousaf\n* Mairi McAllan\n* Stephen Flynn\n\n### **Declined**\n\nThe following candidates declined to stand in the election:\n\n* Nicola Sturgeon\n* John Swinney\n* Shona Robison\n* Michael Russell\n\n### **Endorsements**\n\nThe following candidates received endorsements from other SNP politicians:\n\n### **Kate Forbes**\n\nKate Forbes received endorsements from:\n\n* Stephen Kerr\n* Liam Kerr\n* Ross Greer\n\n### **Ash Regan**\n\nAsh Regan received endorsements from:\n\n* Mairi Gouge\n* Neil Findlay\n* Mary Fee\n\n### **Humza Yousaf**\n\nHumza Yousaf received endorsements from:\n\n* Anas Sarwar\n* Richard Leonard\n* Clare Haughey\n\n### **Declined to endorse**\n\nThe following SNP politicians declined to endorse any of the candidates:\n\n* Nicola Sturgeon\n* John Swinney\n* Shona Robison\n\n**Debates**\n\nThe debates took place on 15 and 22 March 2023, where the five candidates debated each other on key issues.\n\n**Hustings**\n\nThe hustings took place on 15 and 22 March 2023, where the five candidates debated each other on key issues.\n\n**Opinion polling**\n\nThe following opinion polls were conducted during the campaign:\n\n### **SNP membership**\n\nThe following opinion polls were conducted among SNP members:\n\n* A poll by the SNP's membership survey in February 2023 found that Kate Forbes was the most popular candidate, with 31% of the vote.\n* A poll by the SNP's membership survey in March 2023 found that Humza Yousaf was the most popular candidate, with 34% of the vote.\n\n### **2021 SNP voters**\n\nThe following opinion polls were conducted among SNP voters in the 2021 Scottish Parliament election:\n\n* A poll by Survation in February 2023 found that Kate Forbes was the most popular candidate, with 28% of the vote.\n* A poll by Survation in March 2023 found that Humza Yousaf was the most popular candidate, with 30% of the vote.\n\n### **Scottish public**\n\nThe following opinion polls were conducted among the Scottish public:\n\n* A poll by Survation in February 2023 found that 24% of respondents supported Kate Forbes for SNP leader.\n* A poll by Survation in March 2023 found that 27% of respondents supported Humza Yousaf for SNP leader.\n\n**Results**\n\nThe results of the election were announced on 30 March 2023, with Humza Yousaf declared the winner.\n\n### **Preference votes by candidate**\n\nThe following table shows the preference votes cast for each candidate:\n\n| Candidate | First preference votes | Second preference votes | Third preference votes | Total votes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Humza Yousaf | 54,751 | 24,119 | 11,167 | 90,037 |\n| Kate Forbes | 44,854 | 23,321 | 12,247 | 80,422 |\n| Ash Regan | 21,383 | 13,011 | 6,497 | 40,891 |\n| Mairi McAllan | 6,528 | 3,562 | 2,359 | 12,449 |\n| Stephen Flynn | 3,991 | 2,349 | 1,585 | 7,925 |\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe election of Humza Yousaf as SNP leader was seen as a surprise by many, given the strong campaign run by Kate Forbes. However, Yousaf's victory was hailed by many as a new beginning for the SNP, with Yousaf promising to continue the party's commitment to Scottish independence and social justice.\n\nThe election also highlighted the divisions within the SNP, with some members expressing disappointment at the outcome. However, the party's leadership was quick to congratulate Yousaf on his victory, and to pledge their support for his leadership.\n\nThe election of Humza Yousaf as SNP leader also raised questions about the future of the party, and its prospects in the 2026 Scottish Parliament election. However, with Yousaf at the helm, the SNP is likely to continue to be a major force in Scottish politics, and to remain a key player in the debate about Scottish independence.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

{"title": "Lists_of_feature_films_with_LGBT_characters", "content": "#See also\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Lists of feature films with LGBT characters\n\nThe representation of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) characters in feature films has become increasingly prominent in recent years. This article provides an overview of lists of feature films that feature LGBT characters, including films that have been widely recognized for their portrayal of LGBT themes and characters.\n\n**Early Representation**\n\nThe earliest examples of LGBT characters in feature films date back to the early 20th century. However, these representations were often limited to stereotypes and marginalization. One of the earliest examples of a feature film with an LGBT character is the 1931 film \"A Woman of Paris,\" directed by Charles Chaplin. The film features a romantic subplot between two women, but it is not explicitly depicted as a same-sex relationship.\n\n**Golden Age of Hollywood**\n\nDuring the 1930s to 1960s, Hollywood's \"Golden Age,\" LGBT characters continued to appear in films, often in coded or subtle ways. Films such as \"The Women\" (1939), \"Now, Voyager\" (1942), and \"Rebel Without a Cause\" (1955) featured characters who were implied to be gay or lesbian, but these portrayals were often ambiguous and open to interpretation.\n\n**New Wave and Underground Cinema**\n\nThe 1960s and 1970s saw the rise of the French New Wave and underground cinema, which often featured more explicit and experimental portrayals of LGBT characters. Films such as \"Jules et Jim\" (1962), \"Muriel\" (1963), and \"Scorpio Rising\" (1964) pushed the boundaries of mainstream cinema and paved the way for future generations of LGBT filmmakers.\n\n**Mainstream Breakthrough**\n\nThe 1980s saw a significant increase in mainstream films featuring LGBT characters, including \"Making Love\" (1982), \"An Early Frost\" (1985), and \"Parting Glances\" (1986). These films helped to break down barriers and challenge societal norms surrounding LGBT issues.\n\n**Contemporary Era**\n\nIn recent years, there has been a significant increase in the number of films featuring LGBT characters, including \"Brokeback Mountain\" (2005), \"Milk\" (2008), \"Moonlight\" (2016), and \"Call Me By Your Name\" (2017). These films have received widespread critical acclaim and have helped to promote greater understanding and acceptance of LGBT issues.\n\n**Lists of Films**\n\nThe following is a list of notable films that feature LGBT characters:\n\n### Films from the 1930s to 1960s\n\n* \"A Woman of Paris\" (1931)\n* \"The Women\" (1939)\n* \"Now, Voyager\" (1942)\n* \"Rebel Without a Cause\" (1955)\n* \"Jules et Jim\" (1962)\n* \"Muriel\" (1963)\n* \"Scorpio Rising\" (1964)\n\n### Films from the 1970s to 1980s\n\n* \"Scarecrow\" (1973)\n* \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\" (1975)\n* \"Midnight Cowboy\" (1969)\n* \"Making Love\" (1982)\n* \"An Early Frost\" (1985)\n* \"Parting Glances\" (1986)\n\n### Films from the 1990s to 2000s\n\n* \"Philadelphia\" (1993)\n* \"The Birdcage\" (1996)\n* \"Boys Don't Cry\" (1999)\n* \"Mulholland Drive\" (2001)\n* \"Far from Heaven\" (2002)\n* \"Brokeback Mountain\" (2005)\n\n### Films from the 2010s to present\n\n* \"Milk\" (2008)\n* \"The Kids Are All Right\" (2010)\n* \"Beginners\" (2010)\n* \"Moonlight\" (2016)\n* \"Call Me By Your Name\" (2017)\n* \"The Miseducation of Cameron Post\" (2018)\n\n**See Also**\n\n* List of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender-related films\n* List of films featuring a gay character\n* List of films featuring a lesbian character\n* List of films featuring a bisexual character\n* List of films featuring a transgender character", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

However, his peaceful life is disrupted when he is approached by his goddaughter, Helena Shaw (Phoebe Waller-Bridge), who has discovered a cryptic map that leads to the Dial of Destiny. The Dial, created by the ancient German philosopher and mystic, Immanuel Kant, is said to have the power to manipulate time and space.\n\nAs Indiana and Helena embark on their quest, they are joined by a young and ambitious journalist, Jádola (Mads Mikkelsen), who has his own motives for retrieving the Dial. The trio soon finds themselves in a treacherous game of cat and mouse, as they navigate through the streets of Italy, the Swiss Alps, and the deserts of Egypt. Along the way, they must confront treacherous villains, including the enigmatic and ruthless adversary, Wilhelm (Thomas Kretschmann), who will stop at nothing to claim the Dial for himself.\n\nAs Indiana and his companions draw closer to their goal, they begin to unravel the secrets of the Dial and the true purpose of Kant's creation. Along the way, Indiana must confront his own mortality and the changing world around him, as he realizes that his adventures are coming to an end.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones\n* Phoebe Waller-Bridge as Helena Shaw\n* Thomas Kretschmann as Wilhelm\n* Mads Mikkelsen as Jádola\n* Boyd Holbrook as Antonius Drella\n* Shaunette Renée Wilson as Dr. Sophie Blank\n* Toby Jones as Basil Shaw\n\n**Production**\n\n### Development\n\nThe idea for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny was first conceived in the early 2000s, shortly after the release of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
