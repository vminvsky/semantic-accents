Night Shyamalan, who co-wrote the screenplay with Guy Busick. The film stars Dave Bautista, Jonathan Groff, Ben Aldridge, Nikki Amuka-Bird, Abby Quinlan, and Rupert Grint.\n\nThe film follows a group of four friends who are forced to make a difficult decision when a stranger appears at their remote cabin, demanding they make a choice between sacrificing one of their own or risking the end of the world.\n\nPlot\n--------\n\nThe film begins with a group of four friends, Redmond (Jonathan Groff), Sabrina (Nikki Amuka-Bird), Eric (Ben Aldridge), and Andrew (Rupert Grint), arriving at a remote cabin in the woods. They have been friends since college and have planned this trip to reconnect and rekindle their friendships. However, their trip is interrupted by a stranger, Leonard (Dave Bautista), who appears at the cabin with a gun and demands they make a choice.\n\nLeonard explains that the world is about to end and that they have a choice to make: either sacrifice one of their own, or risk the end of the world. The group is shocked and divided, with some members wanting to make the difficult choice and others refusing to do so. As the situation deteriorates, the group begins to turn on each other, leading to a series of tense and violent confrontations.\n\nAs the group struggles to come to a decision, they begin to uncover the truth about Leonard's motivations and the nature of the apocalypse. They also discover that Leonard is not the only one who has been affected by the impending disaster, and that there are others who are also struggling to cope with the consequences.\n\nCast\n-----\n\nThe film features a talented cast, including:\n\n* Dave Bautista as Leonard\n* Jonathan Groff as Redmond\n* Ben Aldridge as Eric\n* Nikki Amuka-Bird as Sabrina\n* Abby Quinn as Andrew\n* Rupert Grint as Andrew\n\nProduction\n-----------\n\n### Development\n\nThe film was first announced in 2020, with M. Night Shyamalan set to direct and co-write the screenplay with Guy Busick. The film was originally set to be a thriller, but Shyamalan has said that he became interested in incorporating elements of horror into the story. The film's script was written in just a few weeks, with Shyamalan and Busick working closely together to develop the story.\n\n### Casting\n\nThe casting process for the film was extensive, with Shyamalan and his team auditioning a number of actors for the lead roles. Dave Bautista was chosen for the role of Leonard, while Jonathan Groff and Ben Aldridge were cast as Redmond and Eric, respectively. Nikki Amuka-Bird and Abby Quinn were cast as Sabrina and Andrew, and Rupert Grint rounded out the cast as Andrew.\n\n### Filming\n\nFilming for the film took place in Pennsylvania, with Shyamalan and his team using a combination of location shooting and studio work to bring the story to life. The film's budget was reportedly around $20 million, which was relatively modest compared to some of Shyamalan's other films. Despite the low budget, the film's visual effects and production design were praised by critics, who noted that the film's use of practical effects added to its sense of realism.\n\nRelease\n--------\n\nThe film was released on February 3, 2023, in the United States, where it was distributed by Universal Pictures. The film's release was accompanied by a number of promotional activities, including a red carpet premiere and a number of interviews with the cast and crew.\n\n### Home Media\n\nThe film was released on home media on April 18, 2023, where it was available on DVD, Blu-ray, and digital download. The home media release included a number of special features, including a behind-the-scenes look at the film's production and a number of deleted scenes.\n\nReception\n----------\n\nThe film received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised its tense and suspenseful storyline and its well-developed characters. The film holds a 72% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with many critics praising its use of practical effects and its sense of realism.\n\n### Box Office\n\nThe film performed well at the box office, grossing over $100 million worldwide on its opening weekend. The film's success was seen as a surprise by many, given its relatively modest budget and its release in a crowded marketplace. However, the film's strong word-of-mouth and its positive reviews helped it to sustain its box office performance over the course of its run.\n\n### Critical Response\n\nThe film received praise from critics for its tense and suspenseful storyline, as well as its well-developed characters. Many critics noted that the film's use of practical effects added to its sense of realism, and that the film's visual effects were impressive. However, some critics noted that the film's pacing was slow in places, and that the film's climax was not as satisfying as it could have been.\n\n### Accolades\n\nThe film received a number of awards and nominations in 2023, including a nomination for Best Thriller at the MTV Movie Awards and a nomination for Best Visual Effects at the Visual Effects Society Awards. The film's cast and crew also received a number of nominations for their work on the film, including a nomination for Best Director for M.

The monument has become a source of fascination and controversy, attracting visitors and sparking debates about its meaning and purpose.\n\n**History**\n\n### Construction\n\nThe Georgia Guidestones were commissioned by an individual who wished to remain anonymous, and were built by a local granite company, Elberton Granite Finishing Company. The monument was designed by an architect who was also not identified. The construction of the Guidestones began in 1979 and was completed in 1980. The monument is made of six large granite stones, each weighing around 20 tons, and is surrounded by a circular wall.\n\n### Reaction\n\nThe Georgia Guidestones were met with a mixture of curiosity and suspicion when they were first unveiled. Some people saw them as a valuable public art installation, while others viewed them as a strange and potentially threatening monument. The monument's enigmatic message and the fact that the person who commissioned it remained anonymous only added to the mystery and intrigue surrounding it.\n\n### Destruction\n\nOn July 6, 2022, the Georgia Guidestones were severely damaged in an explosion. The blast destroyed the top third of the monument, leaving the remaining stones intact. The incident has been the subject of much speculation and debate, with some people suggesting that the destruction was a deliberate act of vandalism, while others have speculated about the possibility of a more sinister motive.\n\n### Aftermath\n\nThe destruction of the Georgia Guidestones has sparked a lively debate about the monument's significance and the impact on the local community.

The tablet also provides a brief history of the monument's construction and the meaning of the inscriptions.\n\n### Physical data\n\nThe Georgia Guidestones are made of six large granite stones, each weighing around 20 tons. The stones are arranged in a circular pattern, with the first stone bearing the first three guidelines, the second stone bearing the next three guidelines, and so on. The inscriptions are engraved on the stones using a laser cutting technique, and are visible from a distance.\n\n### Guidestone languages\n\nThe Georgia Guidestones are engraved with a set of ten guidelines, known as the Guidestones, which are written in eight different languages: English, Spanish, Swahili, Hindi, Hebrew, Arabic, Chinese, and Russian.

It is the foundation of human civilization, providing the resources and habitat necessary for life to thrive. Land encompasses a vast array of physical and biological characteristics, shaped by geological processes and influenced by climate, human activity, and other factors.\n\n**Definition**\n\nLand is often distinguished from water, which covers approximately 71% of the Earth's surface. However, this distinction is not absolute, as land and water are closely intertwined, with coastlines and riverbanks serving as transitional zones between the two. In addition, land can be further classified into various types, including continents, islands, mountains, and plains.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe word \"land\" is derived from the Old English word \"lande,\" which referred to the earth or soil. This term has evolved over time to encompass a broader range of meanings, including the physical surface of the Earth, real estate, and the natural environment.\n\n**Physical Science**\n\nLand is a complex and dynamic system, shaped by geological processes that have unfolded over billions of years. Key aspects of land include:\n\n### **Formation**\n\nLand formation begins with the creation of the Earth's crust, which is composed of various rock types, including granite, basalt, and sandstone. These rocks are formed through a combination of volcanic, tectonic, and metamorphic processes. Over time, erosion and weathering break down the rocks, creating a diverse range of landforms, from mountains to valleys.\n\n### **Landmasses**\n\nThe Earth's surface is divided into several major landmasses, including continents, islands, and archipelagos. These landmasses are separated by oceans and seas, which play a crucial role in shaping the climate and ecosystems of the surrounding regions.\n\n### **Terrain**\n\nTerrain refers to the physical characteristics of land, including its elevation, slope, and relief. Terrain can range from flat plains to rugged mountain ranges, and influences the distribution of climate, vegetation, and wildlife.\n\n### **Geomorphology**\n\nGeomorphology is the study of the shape and form of land. It encompasses a range of topics, including the creation and erosion of landforms, the movement of sediment, and the impact of human activity on the landscape.\n\n### **Climate**\n\nClimate is a critical factor in shaping the characteristics of land. It influences the distribution of temperature, precipitation, and wind patterns, which in turn affect the growth of vegetation, the formation of soil, and the distribution of wildlife.\n\n**Features**\n\nLand is characterized by a diverse range of features, including:\n\n### **Coasts and Islands**\n\nCoasts and islands are transitional zones between land and water. They are shaped by a combination of geological and oceanic processes, including erosion, sedimentation, and tidal action.\n\n### **Mountains and Plateaus**\n\nMountains and plateaus are elevated landforms that are formed through a combination of tectonic and volcanic processes. They can be characterized by steep slopes, rugged terrain, and unique ecosystems.\n\n### **Plains and Valleys**\n\nPlains and valleys are low-lying landforms that are often formed through erosion or sedimentation. They can be characterized by flat or gently sloping terrain, and may support a range of ecosystems, including grasslands and wetlands.\n\n### **Caves and Craters**\n\nCaves and craters are unique landforms that are formed through a combination of geological and biological processes. They can provide important habitats for a range of organisms, including microorganisms, insects, and mammals.\n\n**Layers**\n\nLand is composed of a range of layers, including:\n\n### **Land Cover**\n\nLand cover refers to the physical surface of the land, including vegetation, soil, and other features. It can be characterized by a range of parameters, including the type and density of vegetation, the distribution of soil types, and the presence of other land features.\n\n### **Soil**\n\nSoil is a critical component of land, providing the foundation for plant growth, filtering water, and storing carbon. It can be characterized by a range of parameters, including texture, structure, and fertility.\n\n### **Continental Crust**\n\nThe continental crust is the outermost layer of the Earth's surface, comprising the rocks and sediments that make up the continents. It is a dynamic system, influenced by a range of geological processes, including tectonic activity and weathering.\n\n**Life Science**\n\nLand is home to a diverse range of ecosystems, including:\n\n### **Land Biomes**\n\nLand biomes are large regions of land characterized by a unique combination of climate, vegetation, and wildlife. Examples include tropical rainforests, temperate grasslands, and arctic tundras.\n\n### **Fauna and Flora**\n\nFauna and flora refer to the animal and plant life that inhabits land. They are adapted to a range of environments, from the driest deserts to the wettest rainforests, and play critical roles in shaping the ecosystems of land.\n\n**Humans and Land**\n\nHumans have a complex relationship with land, shaped by a range of factors, including:\n\n### **Culture**\n\nCulture refers to the social and economic systems that humans develop on land. It encompasses a range of topics, including agriculture, architecture, and art.\n\n### **Travel**\n\nTravel refers to the movement of humans across land, often for recreational or economic purposes.

From its early beginnings to the present day, the telephone has evolved significantly, transforming the way people communicate and interact with one another. This article will explore the history of the telephone in the United States, focusing on the key events, individuals, and innovations that shaped the industry.\n\n**#AT&T and the Bell System**\n\nThe history of the telephone in the United States is closely tied to the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T) and the Bell System. The Bell System was a monopoly that dominated the telecommunications industry for over a century.\n\n**##American Bell Telephone Company (1881â1899)**\n\nThe American Bell Telephone Company was founded in 1881 by Alexander Graham Bell, the inventor of the telephone. Bell's invention was the first device to transmit the human voice over wires, revolutionizing long-distance communication. The company quickly grew, and by the late 1880s, it had established a network of telephone exchanges throughout the United States. In 1899, American Bell Telephone Company was incorporated, and its name was changed to AT&T.\n\n**##AT&T (1899â1982)**\n\nIn 1899, AT&T was formed after the merger of American Bell Telephone Company and the American Telephone and Telegraph Company. Under the leadership of Theodore Vail, AT&T expanded its services, introducing direct distance dialing and long-distance service. The company also developed the first telephone switchboards, which enabled operators to connect calls across the country. By the mid-20th century, AT&T had become a monopoly, controlling over 90% of the telecommunications market.\n\n**##Research priority**\n\nResearch and development were a priority for AT&T, with the company investing heavily in emerging technologies. In the 1960s and 1970s, AT&T developed the first digital switching systems, which enabled faster and more efficient communication. The company also explored satellite communication, launching the first commercial communications satellite in 1965.\n\n**##Targeting an audience**\n\nAT&T targeted several key audiences, including urban public telephones and rural telephone service.\n\n**###Urban public telephones**\n\nIn the early 20th century, AT&T introduced public telephone booths in cities across the United States. These booths were designed to be easy to use and accessible to the public, revolutionizing the way people communicated in urban areas.\n\n**###Rural telephone service**\n\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, AT&T expanded its services to rural areas, introducing rural telephone exchanges and cooperative telephone companies. These services enabled rural communities to access long-distance communication, transforming the way people lived and worked in these areas.\n\n**##Breakup of AT&T in 1982**\n\nIn 1982, AT&T was broken up into seven regional Bell operating companies (RBOCs), as a result of a government antitrust lawsuit. This breakup marked the end of the Bell System monopoly and paved the way for competition in the telecommunications industry.\n\n**#Cellphones and smartphones**\n\nThe 1980s saw the introduction of cellphones, which revolutionized personal communication. In the 1990s and 2000s, smartphones emerged, enabling users to access email, the internet, and a wide range of applications.\n\n**#Personnel**\n\nThe telephone industry has a long history of employing women in key roles, including switchboard operators and labor force.\n\n**##Switchboard and operators**\n\nSwitchboard operators played a crucial role in the early days of the telephone industry, connecting calls and providing customer service. Many women worked as switchboard operators, and their work was often characterized as a \"pink-collar\" job.\n\n**##Labor force: bias for and against women**\n\nThe telephone industry has faced controversy over its treatment of women workers. In the 1960s and 1970s, women made up a significant portion of the labor force, but they often faced bias and stereotypes. Women were often limited to lower-paying jobs and were excluded from senior positions.\n\n**###Strikes**\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, women telephone workers organized strikes to demand better working conditions and equal pay. These strikes, including the 1975 AT&T strike, highlighted the struggles faced by women in the industry.\n\n**##Hawthorne studies**\n\nThe Hawthorne studies, conducted by Elton Mayo in the 1920s and 1930s, investigated the effects of working conditions on employee productivity. The studies found that social factors, including relationships with coworkers and supervisors, played a significant role in employee satisfaction and motivation.\n\n**##Employee benefits**\n\nThe telephone industry has a long history of providing employee benefits, including health insurance, retirement plans, and education programs. These benefits have helped to attract and retain employees, and have contributed to the industry's low turnover rates.\n\n**#Users**\n\nThe telephone industry has a diverse range of users, including businesses, housewives, and individuals.\n\n**##Business**\n\nBusinesses have used the telephone for decades, relying on it for long-distance communication and customer service. The rise of the internet and email has reduced the need for traditional phone services, but businesses still use the phone for critical functions, such as customer service and sales.\n\n**##Housewives**\n\nHousewives have also relied on the telephone for communication, using it to stay in touch with family and friends. The rise of mobile phones has made it easier for housewives to stay connected, and many use their phones for social media and online shopping.\n\n**##Gender and culture roles**\n\nThe telephone has played a significant role in shaping gender and culture roles. In the early 20th century, women were often seen as the primary users of the telephone, and were expected to manage household communication. As the industry has evolved, men and women have shared responsibilities, and the telephone has become a tool for communication, rather than a symbol of domesticity.\n\n**##Telemarketing**\n\nTelemarketing has been a major function of the telephone industry, with companies using the phone to sell products and services. The rise of the internet and email has reduced the need for telemarketing, but it remains an important tool for businesses.\n\n**##9-1-1**\n\nThe telephone industry has played a critical role in the development of emergency services, including 9-1-1. The first 9-1-1 call was made in 1968, and since then, the service has expanded to include text messaging and online reporting.\n\n**##Harassing calls**\n\nThe telephone industry has faced controversy over harassing calls, including telemarketing and prank calls. The Do Not Call Registry was established in 2003 to help consumers block unwanted calls.\n\n**##Literary fears**\n\nThe telephone has been the subject of literary fears, including the concept of a \"phone booth\" in the classic film \"The Exorcist.\" The telephone has also been used as a tool for horror, including in the film \"Answer the Phone\" (1999).\n\n**#See also**\n\n* History of the Telephone\n* AT&T\n* Bell System\n* Switchboard operators\n* Telemarketing\n* 9-1-1\n\n**#References**\n\n* AT&T Corporation.

Born on December 8, 1970, in Dublin, Ireland, O'Connor has released several critically acclaimed albums throughout her career, earning her a reputation as one of the most innovative and influential artists of her generation.\n\n**Early life and education**\n\nSinÃ©ad O'Connor was born to John and Sean O'Connor, a teenage mother and a 25-year-old father, respectively. Her mother's age at the time of her birth has been reported as 15 or 16, but this has not been confirmed. O'Connor's early life was marked by poverty and instability, with her family often relying on social services for support.\n\nDespite these challenges, O'Connor's parents encouraged her love of music from an early age. She began singing in a local church choir and later attended Mount Anville Secondary School, where she was exposed to a wide range of musical influences. O'Connor's early musical tastes were shaped by artists such as Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, and Stevie Wonder, and she later developed a passion for Irish traditional music.\n\n**Music career**\n\n### 1980s\n\nO'Connor's music career began in the late 1980s, when she formed a band called Ton Ton Macoute. The band released a single, \"Take Your Sister for a Ride,\" but it failed to achieve commercial success. Undeterred, O'Connor continued to work on her craft, developing her unique vocal style and writing songs that reflected her own experiences and emotions.\n\n### 1987â1989: The Lion and the Cobra\n\nO'Connor's debut solo album, The Lion and the Cobra, was released in 1987 to critical acclaim. The album featured a mix of rock, pop, and Irish traditional music influences, and included the hit single \"Mandinka.\" While the album was not a commercial success at the time, it has since been recognized as a groundbreaking work that helped establish O'Connor as a major talent.\n\n### 1990â1993: I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got\n\nO'Connor's second album, I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got, was released in 1990 to widespread critical acclaim. The album featured a more stripped-down and introspective sound than its predecessor, and included the hit singles \"Nothing Compares 2 U\" and \"Three Babies.\" The album's success was fueled in part by O'Connor's high-profile appearance on Saturday Night Live, during which she famously tore up a photograph of Pope John Paul II.\n\n### Saturday Night Live protest\n\nOn October 3, 1992, O'Connor appeared on Saturday Night Live, where she sang her hit single \"Nothing Compares 2 U\" in a rendition that was widely praised for its emotional intensity. However, the performance was also marked by controversy, as O'Connor tore up a photograph of Pope John Paul II that had been presented to her during the broadcast. The gesture was seen as a protest against the Catholic Church's handling of child abuse allegations, and sparked a heated debate about the role of art and politics.\n\n### 1993â2000\n\nO'Connor's subsequent albums, including 1993's Am I Not Your Girl?, 1994's Jian, and 1996's Faith and Courage, continued to explore themes of love, loss, and social justice. While the albums received critical acclaim, they were not as commercially successful as her earlier work. O'Connor's personal life was also marked by turmoil during this period, including a highly publicized marriage to musician John Reynolds and a struggle with addiction.\n\n### 2000s\n\nO'Connor's 2000 album Faith and Courage was her first to achieve commercial success in several years, thanks in part to the hit single \"Faith and Courage.\" The album marked a new direction for O'Connor, incorporating more electronic and dance influences into her sound. However, the album was also criticized for its perceived lack of depth and nuance.\n\n### 2010s\n\nO'Connor's subsequent albums, including 2010's The Lion and the Cobra (a reissue of her 1987 album) and 2012's How About I Be Me (And You Be You?), continued to explore themes of love, loss, and social justice. While the albums received critical acclaim, they were not as commercially successful as her earlier work. O'Connor's personal life was also marked by turmoil during this period, including a highly publicized marriage to musician Steve Cooney and a struggle with addiction.\n\n### 2020â2023: Memoir and death of son\n\nIn 2020, O'Connor published a memoir, The Lion's Share, which detailed her early life and career. The book was widely praised for its honesty and vulnerability. However, the book was also marked by controversy, as O'Connor's son Shane O'Connor died in 2020 at the age of 17. O'Connor has since spoken publicly about her grief and struggle to cope with the loss of her son.\n\n**Personal life**\n\nO'Connor has been married four times: to John Reynolds, Steve Cooney, Barry Herridge, and Donal Lunny. She has four children: Jake Reynolds, Roisin Lunny, Shane O'Connor, and Yeshua Boni.\n\n**Marriages and children**\n\nO'Connor's relationships with her partners have been marked by controversy and drama. Her marriage to John Reynolds was highly publicized, and the couple had two children together. However, the marriage ended in divorce, and O'Connor has since spoken publicly about the abuse she suffered at the hands of her former partner.\n\n**Other relationships**\n\nO'Connor has also been in relationships with several other men, including musician Iarla Ã LionÃ¡ird and writer David Mullen. However, these relationships were not as publicized as her marriages, and O'Connor has not spoken publicly about the details of these relationships.\n\n**Homes**\n\nOConnor has lived in several different homes throughout her career. She currently resides in County Wicklow, Ireland, with her family.\n\n**Sexuality**\n\nO'Connor has been open about her attraction to men and women, and has identified as bisexual. However, she has also stated that she is not interested in labeling her sexuality, and prefers to focus on her music and activism.\n\n**Politics**\n\nO'Connor has been involved in several high-profile controversies throughout her career, including her criticism of the Catholic Church and her support for the Palestinian people. She has also been a vocal advocate for social justice and human rights.\n\n**Religion**\n\nO'Connor was raised as a Catholic, but has since become increasingly critical of the Church. She has stated that she no longer identifies as a Catholic, and has spoken publicly about the abuse she suffered at the hands of Catholic clergy.\n\n**Health**\n\nO'Connor has struggled with addiction and mental health issues throughout her career. She has been open about her experiences, and has used her platform to raise awareness about these issues.\n\n**Death**\n\nOn July 26, 2023, O'Connor passed away at the age of 52. Her death was confirmed by her family, and tributes poured in from fans and fellow musicians around the world.\n\n**Tributes**\n\nO'Connor's death was met with an outpouring of tributes from fans and fellow musicians. Many of her colleagues and friends praised her talent, passion, and commitment to social justice. She is remembered as a trailblazing artist who used her platform to speak truth to power and challenge the status quo.\n\n**In popular culture**\n\nO'Connor's music and image have been referenced and parodied in popular culture. Her iconic performance on Saturday Night Live is widely regarded as one of the most memorable moments in the show's history.\n\n**Discography**\n\n* The Lion and the Cobra (1987)\n* I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got (1990)\n* Am I Not Your Girl?

The species has been of great interest to botanists and naturalists for its unique features and its potential uses.\n\n**Species discovery**\n\nTorreya taxifolia was first described by botanist and explorer John Torrey in 1853. The species was initially known as Torreya taxifolia var. floridana, but it was later elevated to species status by botanists due to its distinct characteristics.\n\n**Taxonomy and naming**\n\nThe genus Torreya is a group of conifers in the family Taxaceae. The name Torreya is derived from the surname of John Torrey, the botanist who first described the species. The species epithet taxifolia refers to the plant's leaves, which resemble those of the yew (Taxus).\n\n**Type species of genus Torreya**\n\nTorreya taxifolia is the type species of the genus Torreya. The species has been used as a reference point for the identification of other species in the genus.\n\n**Common names**\n\nTorreya taxifolia is commonly known as the Florida nutmeg tree or the Florida torreya. The plant is also referred to as the Florida nutmeg because of its edible seeds, which resemble nutmeg in appearance and flavor.\n\n**Description**\n\n**Technical description**\n\nTorreya taxifolia is a small to medium-sized tree that grows up to 30 feet (9 meters) in height. The plant has a conical shape, with a straight trunk and a narrow, pointed crown. The bark is grayish-brown and scaly, with deep furrows and ridges.\n\n**Subcanopy growth adaptations**\n\nTorreya taxifolia has adaptations that allow it to grow and thrive in the subcanopy layer of forests. The plant's small size and narrow crown allow it to grow beneath the canopy of larger trees, where it can receive filtered light and maintain a stable temperature.\n\n**Distribution**\n\n**Wild population**\n\nTorreya taxifolia is found in the wild in only a few locations in the southeastern United States. The plant is endemic to the state of Florida, where it grows in the Panhandle region. The largest population of Torreya taxifolia is found in the Apalachicola National Forest, where the plant grows in a unique ecosystem known as the \"torreya garden\".\n\n**Prehistoric distribution**\n\nFossil evidence suggests that Torreya taxifolia was once more widely distributed in the southeastern United States. Fossils of the species have been found in the state of Georgia, where the plant is now extinct.\n\n**Ecology**\n\n**Habitat**\n\nTorreya taxifolia grows in a variety of habitats, including forests, woodlands, and scrublands. The plant prefers areas with well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade.\n\n**Seed dispersal**\n\nTorreya taxifolia seeds are dispersed by birds, which eat the seeds and then deposit them in new locations. The seeds are also dispersed by other animals, such as squirrels and deer.\n\n**Extinction threats**\n\nTorreya taxifolia is threatened by a number of factors, including habitat loss and degradation, climate change, and disease.\n\n**Vulnerabilities of restricted range size**\n\nThe plant's restricted range size makes it vulnerable to extinction. Torreya taxifolia is found in only a few locations in the southeastern United States, and its populations are fragmented and isolated.\n\n**The die-off begins**\n\nThe die-off of Torreya taxifolia began in the 1990s, when the plant's populations in the Apalachicola National Forest began to decline rapidly.\n\n**The role of pathogens in the die-off**\n\nPathogens are believed to have played a significant role in the die-off of Torreya taxifolia. The plant is susceptible to a number of diseases, including a stem canker fungus that has been linked to the plant's decline.\n\n**The role of habitat deterioration in the die-off**\n\nHabitat deterioration is also believed to have contributed to the die-off of Torreya taxifolia. The plant's habitat in the Apalachicola National Forest has been degraded over the years, due to factors such as logging and climate change.\n\n**Focus on a stem canker fungus**\n\nA stem canker fungus has been identified as a major contributor to the die-off of Torreya taxifolia. The fungus, which is believed to be caused by a species of Phoma, has been found on the plant in high concentrations.\n\n**Ultimate cause of die-off still unsolved**\n\nDespite efforts to identify the cause of the die-off, the ultimate cause of the decline of Torreya taxifolia remains unknown.\n\n**Conservation actions**\n\n**Protect areas in species range**\n\nConservation efforts are underway to protect areas within the range of Torreya taxifolia. The Apalachicola National Forest has been designated as a protected area, and efforts are being made to restore the plant's habitat.\n\n**List the species as endangered**\n\nTorreya taxifolia has been listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List.\n\n**In situ habitat improvement**\n\nEfforts are being made to improve the habitat of Torreya taxifolia in situ. This includes the removal of invasive species and the restoration of the plant's native habitat.\n\n**Ex situ genetic safeguarding**\n\nEx situ genetic safeguarding is also being used to protect Torreya taxifolia. Seeds from the plant are being collected and stored in a seed bank, where they can be used to establish new populations.\n\n**Document early horticultural plantings**\n\nEarly horticultural plantings of Torreya taxifolia are being documented, in order to track the plant's growth and development in a controlled environment.\n\n**Conservation controversies**\n\n**Assisted migration (the policy debate)**\n\nThere is ongoing debate about the use of assisted migration to help restore Torreya taxifolia populations. Some argue that the practice is necessary to help the plant adapt to changing climate conditions, while others argue that it is a form of \"genetic pollution\" that can harm the plant's evolutionary integrity.\n\n**Management of seeds produced ex situ**\n\nThere is also controversy over the management of seeds produced ex situ. Some argue that seeds should be managed in a way that prioritizes the genetic diversity of the plant, while others argue that seeds should be managed in a way that prioritizes the plant's reproductive potential.\n\n**Seeds produced from official plantings**\n\nSeeds produced from official plantings of Torreya taxifolia are being used to establish new populations. However, there is controversy over the management of these seeds, with some arguing that they should be used to establish new populations in the plant's native range, and others arguing that they should be used to establish new populations in areas with suitable climate conditions.\n\n**Seeds accessed by citizens**\n\nSeeds accessed by citizens are being used to establish new populations of Torreya taxifolia. However, there is controversy over the management of these seeds, with some arguing that they should be used to establish new populations in the plant's native range, and others arguing that they should be used to establish new populations in areas with suitable climate conditions.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

It is native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Western Asia. This article provides an in-depth overview of the plant's distribution, habitat, adaptations, and various uses.\n\n**Distribution**\n\nAnagyris foetida is widely distributed across the Mediterranean region, including countries such as Spain, France, Italy, Greece, Turkey, and Israel. It can also be found in parts of Western Asia, including Iran and Iraq. The plant is typically found in areas with well-drained soils and a Mediterranean climate.\n\n**Habitat**\n\nAnagyris foetida thrives in a variety of habitats, including rocky outcrops, scrublands, and open woodlands. It is often found in areas with poor soil quality, where other plants may struggle to grow. The plant's ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions makes it an ideal pioneer species in areas where the soil has been disturbed or degraded.\n\n**Adaptations to growth in Winter and early Spring**\n\nAnagyris foetida has several adaptations that allow it to grow and thrive during the winter and early spring months.\n\n### Summer leaf-fall\n\nOne of the unique characteristics of Anagyris foetida is its ability to shed its leaves during the summer months. This process, known as summer leaf-fall, allows the plant to conserve water and protect itself from extreme temperatures. The leaves typically fall in July and August, and the plant remains dormant until the following spring.\n\n### Pollination by birds\n\nAnagyris foetida is pollinated by birds, particularly those that feed on nectar and insects. The plant's flowers are rich in nectar, which attracts a variety of bird species. In return for the nectar, the birds transfer pollen between flowers, allowing the plant to reproduce.\n\n**Seed dispersal**\n\nAnagyris foetida has several mechanisms for seed dispersal, including soil seed banks, olive mimicry, and the role of sheep and other mammals and birds.\n\n### Soil seed banks\n\nAnagyris foetida seeds can remain dormant in the soil for several years, forming a seed bank. This allows the plant to continue growing and thriving even in areas where the soil has been disturbed or degraded.\n\n### Olive mimicry\n\nThe seeds of Anagyris foetida resemble those of the olive tree, making them difficult to distinguish from one another. This mimicry allows the seeds to be dispersed by humans and animals, who may mistake them for olive seeds.\n\n### Role of sheep\n\nSheep have been observed to play a significant role in the dispersal of Anagyris foetida seeds. The seeds are often found in the digestive system of sheep, where they are dispersed through their droppings.\n\n### Other possible mammalian and avian vectors\n\nIn addition to sheep, other mammals and birds may also contribute to the dispersal of Anagyris foetida seeds. These include deer, goats, and various bird species that feed on the plant's seeds.\n\n### Unknown seed dispersal vector\n\nThere may be additional, unknown vectors that contribute to the dispersal of Anagyris foetida seeds. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms of seed dispersal in this plant.\n\n### Tough, waterproof seed coats\n\nThe seeds of Anagyris foetida have a tough, waterproof coating that allows them to survive for extended periods in the soil. This coating also helps to protect the seed from extreme temperatures and other environmental stressors.\n\n**Value as a nitrogen-fixing pioneer and companion plant**\n\nAnagyris foetida has several values as a nitrogen-fixing pioneer and companion plant. Its ability to fix nitrogen from the air makes it an ideal crop for areas with poor soil quality. The plant also provides a habitat for a variety of beneficial insects and microorganisms, making it a valuable companion plant for other crops.\n\n**Medicinal use**\n\nAnagyris foetida has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes, including the treatment of fever, rheumatism, and skin conditions. The plant's roots and leaves are rich in alkaloids, which have been shown to have antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties.\n\n**Toxicity**\n\nAnagyris foetida is toxic to humans and animals, particularly in large quantities. The plant's alkaloids can cause a range of symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.\n\n### Alkaloid anagyrine a cause of birth defects\n\nThe alkaloid anagyrine has been shown to cause birth defects in animal studies. This has led to concerns about the safety of Anagyris foetida for human consumption.\n\n### Danger to children\n\nChildren are particularly susceptible to the toxic effects of Anagyris foetida. Ingestion of the plant's seeds or leaves can cause serious harm or even death.\n\n### Hazardous tainting of milk products\n\nAnagyris foetida can contaminate milk products, making them hazardous to human consumption. The plant's alkaloids can be ingested through contaminated milk, which can cause a range of symptoms.\n\n### Case of accidental poisoning in Algeria\n\nA case of accidental poisoning by Anagyris foetida was reported in Algeria. The incident resulted in serious harm to several individuals, highlighting the need for caution when handling the plant.\n\n**Cultural references: Anagyris and Anagyrous**\n\nAnagyris and Anagyrous are names that have been associated with Anagyris foetida in various cultures.\n\n### Lysistrata\n\nIn the ancient Greek comedy Lysistrata, the character of Lysistrata is said to be compared to Anagyris foetida.\n\n### Persistence of name\n\nThe name Anagyris has persisted through various cultures and historical periods, highlighting the plant's significance and enduring presence.\n\n**Gallery**\n\nAnagyris foetida is a plant with a unique appearance, which can be seen in the following images.\n\n### Anagyris foetida\n\n[Image of Anagyris foetida]\n\n### Avian pollinators\n\n[Image of avian pollinators visiting Anagyris foetida]\n\n### Avian nectar thief\n\n[Image of an avian nectar thief visiting Anagyris foetida]\n\n### Insect pollinators\n\n[Image of insect pollinators visiting Anagyris foetida]\n\n**See also**\n\n* List of Fabaceae genera\n* List of plants of the Mediterranean region\n* List of plants of Western Asia", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The season premiered on September 19, 2022, and concluded on December 22, 2022, on the Globo network. The show was hosted by Rafinha Bastos and Buffy.\n\n### The game\n\nBig Brother Brasil 23 was a competition where 24 contestants, known as housemates, lived together in a custom-built house with cameras and microphones recording their every move 24/7. The goal was to be the last housemate standing and win the grand prize of R$1.5 million.\n\n#### Final prize change throughout the season\n\nThe final prize of R$1.5 million was increased to R$2.5 million halfway through the season, due to the show's high ratings and popularity. This change was announced on the show's live broadcast, and it sparked a lot of excitement among the housemates and viewers.\n\n#### Super HoH\n\nSuper HoH, or \"Super Head of Household,\" was a special twist introduced in the season. The Super HoH was a competition that took place every two weeks, where the winner would gain immunity from nomination and would also have the power to nominate two housemates for eviction. The Super HoH competition was won by housemate Aline, who went on to win the season.\n\n#### Withdrawal Button\n\nThe Withdrawal Button was a twist introduced in the early stages of the season. The button was located in the kitchen, and if a housemate pressed it, they would be given the opportunity to leave the game voluntarily. However, if they decided to leave, they would be ineligible to win the grand prize. The Withdrawal Button was pressed by two housemates, Leandro and Mariana, but they both decided not to leave the game.\n\n#### FeedBBB\n\nFeedBBB was a live feed of the housemates' activities, which was available to viewers who subscribed to the show's online platform. The live feed provided a behind-the-scenes look at the housemates' daily lives, and it was a popular feature among fans of the show.\n\n#### Selective Collection\n\nSelective Collection was a twist introduced in the mid-season. Housemates were given the opportunity to nominate which housemates they wanted to participate in a competition, and the selected housemates would compete against each other for a prize. The twist was designed to create more drama and tension in the house.\n\n#### Evicted's Message\n\nEvicted's Message was a twist where a evicted housemate would leave a message for the remaining housemates before they left the house.

The invasion has led to a significant escalation of violence, displacement of people, and economic disruption in the region.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Post-Soviet Relations\n\nThe relationship between Russia and Ukraine has been complex and often tense since the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. Ukraine's independence was recognized by Russia, but the two countries have had differing views on issues such as NATO membership, European integration, and the status of the Crimean Peninsula. In 2014, Ukraine's pro-Russian president, Viktor Yanukovych, was ousted in a revolution, and Russia responded by annexing Crimea and supporting separatist movements in eastern Ukraine.\n\n### Ukrainian Revolution, Russian Intervention in Crimea and Donbas\n\nThe Ukrainian revolution, also known as the Euromaidan protests, began in November 2013 in response to Yanukovych's decision to reject a trade agreement with the European Union. The protests escalated into a full-blown revolution, and Yanukovych was forced to flee the country in February 2014. In response, Russia annexed Crimea, a peninsula in southern Ukraine with a majority Russian-speaking population, and began to support separatist movements in eastern Ukraine, particularly in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.\n\n**Prelude**\n\n### Putin's Invasion Announcement\n\nOn 24 February 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a \"special military operation\" in Ukraine, stating that the invasion was necessary to protect Russian-speaking populations in eastern Ukraine.

His work on aerostatics led to a greater understanding of the behavior of gases and the development of new materials.\n\n### **Radio control: the Telekino**\n\nIn the early 20th century, Torres Quevedo became interested in radio control, which was a new technology at the time. He designed and built the \"Telekino\", a radio-controlled ship that was capable of navigating through water. His work on radio control laid the foundation for later developments in robotics and automation.\n\n### **Formal language**\n\nTorres Quevedo was also interested in formal language, which is the study of the structure and syntax of language. He developed a system of formal language that was later adopted by other researchers. His work on formal language laid the foundation for later developments in computer science and artificial intelligence.\n\n### **Laboratory of Automation**\n\nIn the 1920s, Torres Quevedo established a laboratory for automation, where he and his team developed and tested various automated systems. The laboratory was a hub for innovation and experimentation, and it played a significant role in the development of automation and robotics.\n\n### **Chess automaton: El Ajedrecista**\n\nOne of Torres Quevedo's most famous inventions was a chess automaton called \"El Ajedrecista\", which was capable of playing chess against humans. The automaton was powered by a system of pulleys and levers, and it was able to move its pieces across the board in a way that mimicked human movement. El Ajedrecista was a groundbreaking invention that demonstrated the potential of automation and robotics.\n\n### **Essays on Automatics**\n\nTorres Quevedo wrote several essays on automation, which were collected and published in a book called \"Essays on Automatics\". The book provides a comprehensive overview of the field of automation and robotics, and it includes many of Torres Quevedo's most important contributions to the field.\n\n#### **Analytical machines**\n\nIn the essays, Torres Quevedo discusses the development of analytical machines, which are machines that are capable of solving complex mathematical problems. He describes the design and development of several analytical machines, including the \"analizador\", which was capable of solving complex mathematical problems.\n\n## **Naval projects**\n\nTorres Quevedo was also interested in naval projects, and he designed and built several ships and submarines. His work on naval projects led to the development of new materials and techniques, which were later applied to other fields.\n\n## **Other inventions and miscellaneous activities**\n\nIn addition to his work on cableways, analogue calculating machines, aerostatics, radio control, and formal language, Torres Quevedo made significant contributions to several other fields, including:\n\n### **Esperantist**\n\nTorres Quevedo was a fluent speaker of Esperanto, a language that was developed in the late 19th century. He was an active advocate for the use of Esperanto, and he wrote several articles and books on the subject.\n\n### **Spanish-American Technological Dictionary**\n\nTorres Quevedo compiled a dictionary of technological terms, which was intended to facilitate communication between Spanish-speaking and American-speaking engineers and scientists. The dictionary was published in several editions and became a standard reference work in the field.\n\n**Distinctions**\n\nTorres Quevedo was a fellow of the Royal Academy of Sciences and Arts of Barcelona, and he was awarded several honors and awards for his contributions to science and technology. He was also a member of the Spanish Royal Society of Physics and Chemistry, and he served as president of the society on several occasions.\n\n**Personal life, religious beliefs and death**\n\nTorres Quevedo was a devout Catholic, and he believed that science and technology should be used for the benefit of humanity. He was married to a woman named Mercedes, and they had several children together. Torres Quevedo died on December 18, 1936, at the age of 84.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nTorres Quevedo's legacy is a testament to the power of innovation and experimentation. His contributions to cableways, analogue calculating machines, aerostatics, radio control, and formal language laid the foundation for later developments in automation and robotics.

It is one of the most important architectural and cultural landmarks in Ukraine, and its history dates back to the 12th century. The monastery has undergone several significant transformations throughout its history, including destruction, restoration, and rebuilding.\n\n**History**\n\n### Early years\n\nThe history of St. Michael's Monastery begins with the foundation of the Golden-Domed Church in 1108, during the reign of Yaroslav the Wise. The church was built as a commemoration of the Byzantine Emperor Constantine's victory in 1054. Initially, the church was a small wooden structure that stood near the Dnipro River.\n\n### 16thâ17th centuries\n\nIn the 16th century, the monastery became a significant center of learning and spirituality in Ukraine.

The Golden-Domed Church was rebuilt in the Baroque style, and a new bell tower was added. The monastery also became a place of pilgrimage, attracting visitors from across Ukraine.\n\n### 19th century\n\nDuring the 19th century, the monastery underwent significant transformations as a result of the Ukrainian national awakening movement. The monastery became a symbol of Ukrainian culture and national identity, and it played an important role in the development of Ukrainian nationalism.\n\n### 20th century\n\nIn the 20th century, the monastery suffered significant damage during World War II, and it was later demolished by the Soviet authorities. The monastery was rebuilt in the 1990s, and it has since become a major cultural and spiritual center in Ukraine.\n\n### Demolition and aftermath\n\nIn 1936, the Soviet authorities demolished the Golden-Domed Monastery as part of a larger campaign to destroy Ukraine's cultural and historical heritage. The monastery was seen as a symbol of Ukrainian national identity and a threat to Soviet power. The demolition of the monastery was widely condemned by Ukrainian intellectuals and artists.\n\n### Restoration\n\nIn the 1990s, the Ukrainian government began a major restoration project to rebuild the Golden-Domed Monastery. The project was led by a team of architects and engineers who worked closely with local communities and cultural experts.\n\n### Plans and preparatory work\n\nThe restoration project was launched in 1992, with a team of experts conducting a thorough assessment of the site and developing a detailed plan for the reconstruction. The plan included the rebuilding of the Golden-Domed Church, the bell tower, and other buildings on the monastery complex.\n\n### Rebuilding the monastery\n\nThe rebuilding of the monastery was a complex and challenging process that involved the use of traditional techniques and materials. The team of experts worked closely with local craftsmen and artists to ensure that the reconstruction was faithful to the original design.\n\n### Metropolitan see\n\nIn 1998, the monastery was elevated to the status of a metropolitan see by the Ukrainian Orthodox Church. This marked a significant milestone in the history of the monastery, as it became a major center of spiritual and cultural activity in Ukraine.\n\n**Architecture**\n\n### Dates, styles and architects\n\nThe Golden-Domed Monastery was built in several stages, reflecting the changing architectural styles of the time.

It was rebuilt in the 16th century and features a striking golden dome that has become a symbol of Kiev. The cathedral is a masterpiece of Renaissance architecture, with intricate stone carvings and ornate frescoes.\n\n### Rebuilt cathedral\n\nThe rebuilt cathedral was completed in 2000 and features a stunning golden dome that has become a symbol of Kiev.

This phenomenon has occurred in various contexts throughout history, often as a result of a country's dissolution, collapse, or significant changes in its political landscape.\n\n# History\n\n## Russia (1917â1925)\n\nThe Russian Empire was overthrown in the February Revolution of 1917, leading to the establishment of the Provisional Government. However, this government was short-lived, and the Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin, seized power in the October Revolution. The Bolsheviks renamed the country the Soviet Union, marking the beginning of a new era in Russian history.\n\n### Diplomatic missions after 1917\n\nFollowing the October Revolution, the new Soviet government faced significant challenges in maintaining diplomatic relations with other countries. The Russian diplomatic corps was largely disbanded, and many embassies and consulates were closed. However, the Soviet government recognized the importance of maintaining diplomatic channels and continued to operate some embassies and consulates.\n\nIn 1918, the Soviet government established the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, which became responsible for managing the country's diplomatic relations. Despite the challenges, the Soviet government managed to maintain diplomatic relations with several countries, including Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Turkey.\n\n### Dissolution of the Soviet Union\n\nThe Soviet Union dissolved on December 26, 1991, marking the end of the Cold War and the end of a 74-year period of Soviet rule. The dissolution of the Soviet Union led to the establishment of the Russian Federation, which became a recognized sovereign state. However, the legacy of the Soviet Union continued to affect international relations, and many countries maintained diplomatic relations with the now-defunct Soviet Union.\n\n## Spain (1939â1977)\n\nFollowing the Spanish Civil War, General Francisco Franco's Nationalist forces emerged victorious, establishing a dictatorship that lasted until Franco's death in 1975. The Nationalist government was recognized by many countries, but it was not recognized by the international community as the legitimate government of Spain.\n\n### Diplomatic missions after 1939\n\nDespite the lack of international recognition, Spain maintained diplomatic relations with several countries, including Germany, Italy, and Portugal. The Nationalist government also continued to operate diplomatic missions in many countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and France.\n\nHowever, many countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom, maintained relations with the Spanish government in exile, which was led by Republican president JosÃ© MarÃ­a Gil Robles. The government in exile was recognized by many countries, including France, and maintained diplomatic relations until Franco's death in 1975.\n\n## Poland (1939â1990)\n\nPoland was invaded by Nazi Germany in 1939, and the country was occupied for much of World War II. The Polish government-in-exile, led by President WÅadysÅaw Raczkiewicz, continued to function and maintain diplomatic relations with many countries, including the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nHowever, the Polish government-in-exile was not recognized by the Soviet Union, which maintained a puppet government in Poland. The Soviet Union's puppet government, led by BolesÅaw Bierut, was recognized by the international community as the legitimate government of Poland.\n\n### Diplomatic missions after 1939\n\nDespite the lack of recognition by the Soviet Union, Poland maintained diplomatic relations with many countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and France. The Polish government-in-exile also continued to operate diplomatic missions in many countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and France.\n\nHowever, many countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom, maintained relations with the Soviet Union's puppet government in Poland. The Soviet Union's puppet government was recognized by many countries, including France, and maintained diplomatic relations until the end of World War II.\n\n## Afghanistan (2021âpresent)\n\nThe Taliban seized power in Afghanistan in August 2021, following the withdrawal of US and NATO forces from the country. The Taliban established a new government, which was recognized by many countries, including China and Pakistan.\n\nHowever, the new government was not recognized by the international community as the legitimate government of Afghanistan. Many countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom, maintained diplomatic relations with the previous government, which was led by President Ashraf Ghani.\n\n### Diplomatic missions after 2021\n\nDespite the lack of recognition by the international community, Afghanistan maintained diplomatic relations with many countries, including China, Pakistan, and Iran. The new government also continued to operate diplomatic missions in many countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and France.\n\nHowever, many countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom, maintained relations with the previous government in exile, which was led by President Ghani. The government in exile was recognized by many countries, including France, and maintained diplomatic relations until the new government was recognized by the international community.\n\n# See also\n\n* Diplomatic immunity\n* Diplomatic relations\n* International law\n* Sovereignty\n\n# Notes", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.
