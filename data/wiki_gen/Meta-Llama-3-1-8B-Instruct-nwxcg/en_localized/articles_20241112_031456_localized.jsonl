The season began on 13 August 2021 and ended on 22 May 2022.\n\n**The race for first place**\n\nThe 2021–22 Premier League season was highly competitive, with several teams vying for the title. Manchester City, who had won the league in the previous two seasons, were looking to make it three in a row. However, they faced stiff competition from Liverpool, who were looking to win their first league title in 30 years. Chelsea, who had won the Champions League in the previous season, were also in the mix, as were Manchester United and Arsenal.\n\nThe season was marked by a series of twists and turns, with several teams rising to the top of the table only to be overtaken by others. In the end, it came down to the final day of the season, when Manchester City and Liverpool were separated by just one point. Manchester City ultimately won the title, finishing with 93 points from 38 matches.\n\n**Newcastle takeover**\n\nOne of the major stories of the 2021–22 Premier League season was the takeover of Newcastle United by a Saudi-led consortium. The takeover was completed in October 2021, and it marked a new era for the club. The takeover was worth £305 million, and it was seen as a major coup for the club.\n\nThe takeover was not without controversy, however. There were concerns about the human rights record of the Saudi Arabian government, and the club's new owners faced criticism for their links to the government. Despite these concerns, the takeover was seen as a major boost for the club, and it marked a new era of investment and ambition.\n\n**COVID-19 outbreaks force postponements**\n\nThe 2021–22 Premier League season was also marked by a series of COVID-19 outbreaks, which forced several matches to be postponed. The outbreaks were caused by the spread of the Omicron variant, which was highly contagious and caused widespread disruption.\n\nSeveral matches were postponed, including a match between Liverpool and Leeds United, which was postponed due to a COVID-19 outbreak at Leeds. The outbreak forced several members of the Leeds squad to isolate, and the match was eventually rescheduled for a later date.\n\n**Abramovich sanctions**\n\nThe 2021–22 Premier League season was also marked by the sanctions imposed on Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich. The sanctions were imposed by the UK government in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and they banned Abramovich from owning a British company.\n\nThe sanctions had a major impact on Chelsea, who were forced to sell their stadium and other assets. The club's future was uncertain, and it was unclear whether they would be able to survive without Abramovich's backing.\n\n**Final day climax**\n\nThe 2021–22 Premier League season ended in a thrilling climax, with several teams battling for the title. Manchester City and Liverpool were separated by just one point, and it came down to the final day of the season to see who would win the title.\n\nManchester City beat Aston Villa 3-2 in their final match of the season, while Liverpool drew 3-3 with Southampton. Manchester City won the title by a single point, finishing with 93 points from 38 matches.\n\n**Title**\n\nThe 2021–22 Premier League title was won by Manchester City, who finished with 93 points from 38 matches. The title was their third in four seasons, and it marked a major achievement for the club.\n\n**Relegation**\n\nThe 2021–22 Premier League season also saw several teams relegated to the Championship. The teams that were relegated were Norwich City, Watford, and Burnley.\n\n**Champions League, Europa League and Conference League spots**\n\nThe 2021–22 Premier League season also saw several teams qualify for European competition. The teams that qualified for the Champions League were Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea, and Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nThe teams that qualified for the Europa League were Arsenal, Leicester City, and Brighton & Hove Albion. The teams that qualified for the Conference League were West Ham United, Everton, and Wolverhampton Wanderers.\n\n**Other teams**\n\nIn addition to the teams that finished in the top four, several other teams had notable seasons. Newcastle United's takeover marked a major turning point for the club, and they finished with a respectable 13th place finish.\n\nSouthampton finished with a 15th place finish, while Crystal Palace and Leeds United finished with 11th and 17th place finishes respectively.\n\n**Teams**\n\nThe 2021–22 Premier League season consisted of 20 teams.

The election was the first to be held under the new Constitution of 2022, which had been adopted in 2021.\n\n# Background\n\nThe 2022 French legislative election was the result of a combination of factors, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the economic crisis, and the growing sense of discontent among the French population. The election was also marked by a significant shift in the political landscape, with the rise of new parties and the decline of traditional ones.\n\nThe election was also notable for the fact that it was the first to be held under the new Constitution of 2022, which had been adopted in 2021. The new Constitution introduced significant changes to the electoral system, including the reduction of the number of deputies from 577 to 550, and the introduction of a new system of proportional representation.\n\n# Electoral system\n\nThe 2022 French legislative election was held using a mixed-member proportional representation system. Under this system, each of the 577 deputies was elected using a combination of two votes: a constituency vote and a list vote.\n\nIn the constituency vote, voters chose their preferred candidate from among the list of candidates standing in their constituency. The candidate with the most votes in each constituency was elected as a deputy.\n\nIn the list vote, voters chose from among the lists of candidates presented by the different parties. The number of deputies elected from each list was determined by the proportion of votes received by each list.\n\n# Dates\n\nThe 2022 French legislative election was held on two dates: 12 June 2022 for the first round, and 19 June 2022 for the second round.\n\n## First round\n\nThe first round of the election was held on 12 June 2022.

In this round, voters chose from among the list of candidates standing in their constituency, as well as from among the lists of candidates presented by the different parties.\n\nThe results of the second round were as follows:\n\n* Voter turnout: 74.9%\n* Number of registered voters: 47,574,321\n* Number of valid votes: 35,601,319\n\n## National results\n\nThe national results of the election were as follows:\n\n* Number of deputies elected: 577\n* Number of parties represented: 9\n* Number of seats held by the largest party: 250\n\n## Results by constituency\n\nThe results of the election by constituency were as follows:\n\n* Number of constituencies: 577\n* Number of deputies elected: 577\n* Number of seats held by the largest party: 250\n\n## Electorate\n\nThe electorate for the 2022 French legislative election was as follows:\n\n* Number of registered voters: 47,574,321\n* Voter turnout: 65.6% (first round), 74.9% (second round)\n\n# Aftermath\n\n## Formation of parliamentary groups\n\nFollowing the election, the deputies elected formed two main parliamentary groups: the Ensemble (Together) group, which was led by Emmanuel Macron, and the Rassemblement National (National Rally) group, which was led by Marine Le Pen.\n\n## Vote of no confidence\n\nOn 21 June 2022, the Ensemble group presented a motion of no confidence against the government of Élisabeth Borne. The motion was adopted by 270 votes to 248, and the government was forced to resign.\n\n# See also\n\n* 2022 French presidential election\n* 2021 French legislative election\n* French Constitution\n* National Assembly of France\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article does not include any citations or references, as no external sources were consulted during the writing of the article.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

He has been a prominent figure in contemporary literature, known for his unique blend of magical realism, historical fiction, and satire. Rushdie has written over 20 novels, essays, and non-fiction works, and has been translated into more than 40 languages.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nSalman Rushdie was born on June 19, 1947, in Mumbai (then Bombay), India, to Anis Ahmed Rushdie, a merchant, and Negin Bhatt, a homemaker. His family was of mixed Parsi and Muslim ancestry. Rushdie's early life was marked by a love for literature and storytelling, which was encouraged by his mother. He attended the Cathedral and John Connon School in Mumbai and later moved to the UK with his family in 1960.\n\nRushdie studied history at King's College, Cambridge, where he was exposed to the works of E.M. Forster, Virginia Woolf, and other notable authors. He graduated in 1968 and moved to London, where he began his career as a writer.\n\n**Career**\n\n**Copywriter**\n\nBefore becoming a full-time writer, Rushdie worked as a copywriter in advertising agencies in London and New York. He wrote for several prominent brands, including Ogilvy & Mather and DDB Worldwide. Rushdie's experience as a copywriter helped him develop his writing skills and his ability to think creatively.\n\n**Literary Works**\n\n#### **Early Works and Literary Breakthrough, 1975–1987**\n\nRushdie's first novel, **Grimus**, was published in 1975, but it was his second novel, **Midnight's Children**, that brought him widespread recognition. Published in 1981, **Midnight's Children** is a magical realist tale that explores the experiences of a group of children born at the stroke of midnight on August 15, 1947, the day of India's independence from British rule. The novel won the Booker Prize in 1981 and cemented Rushdie's reputation as a rising literary star.\n\n**The Satanic Verses and Haroun and the Sea of Stories, 1988–1990**\n\nIn 1988, Rushdie published **The Satanic Verses**, a novel that explores the experiences of two Indian immigrants in London and their encounters with the supernatural. The book was a critical and commercial success, but it also sparked widespread controversy due to its depiction of the Prophet Muhammad. In response, Ayatollah Khomeini issued a fatwa calling for Rushdie's death.\n\nRushdie's next novel, **Haroun and the Sea of Stories**, was published in 1990. The book is a fantastical tale that explores the power of storytelling and the importance of imagination.\n\n#### **Further Works, 1990s–2000s**\n\nIn the 1990s, Rushdie published several novels, including **The Moor's Last Sigh** and **The Ground Beneath Her Feet**. These novels continued to explore themes of identity, culture, and politics, and were widely praised for their literary merit.\n\n**Later Works, Novels, and Essays, 2015–2024**\n\nIn recent years, Rushdie has published several essays, including **Two Years Eight Months and Twenty-Eight Nights** and **The Golden House**. He has also continued to write novels, including **The Lycan** and **The Stranger's Child**.\n\n**Critical Reception**\n\nRushdie's work has been widely praised for its literary merit, its exploration of complex themes, and its innovative use of language. He has been compared to authors such as Gabriel García Márquez and Toni Morrison, and has been recognized as one of the most important writers of his generation.\n\n**Academic and Other Activities**\n\nRushdie has taught creative writing at several universities, including Yale and Harvard. He has also given numerous lectures and talks on literature and politics, and has been a vocal advocate for freedom of speech and human rights.\n\n**Film and Television**\n\nRushdie's work has been adapted into several films and television shows, including **The Satanic Verses** and **Midnight's Children**. He has also appeared in several documentaries and television programs, including **The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer** and **Charlie Rose**.\n\n**The Satanic Verses and the Fatwā**\n\n**Failed Assassination Attempt (1989)**\n\nOn February 14, 1989, Rushdie was attacked by a mob of Islamist extremists in London. He was stabbed in the neck and suffered serious injuries, but survived the attack.\n\n**Hezbollah's Comments (2006)**\n\nIn 2006, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah called for Rushdie's execution, saying that he was a \"martyr\" and a \"symbol of the West's attack on Islam.\"\n\n**International Guerillas (1990)**\n\nIn 1990, Rushdie received a threatening letter from a group of Islamic extremists, who claimed to be affiliated with the Iranian government. The letter warned Rushdie that he would be killed if he did not retract his comments about the Prophet Muhammad.\n\n**Al-Qaeda Hit List (2010)**\n\nIn 2010, Rush", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

Prior to his presidency, he served as the Prime Minister of Russia from 1999 to 2000 and again from 2008 to 2012. He has also been the leader of the United Russia party, which has been the dominant party in Russian politics since 2003.\n\n**Early life**\n\nVladimir Putin was born on October 7, 1952, in Leningrad, Russian SFSR, Soviet Union (now Saint Petersburg, Russia). His father, Vladimir Spiridonovich Putin, was a conscript in the Soviet Navy, and his mother, Maria Shelomova, was a factory worker.

He then worked as a foreign intelligence officer for the KGB, serving in East Germany and later in the Soviet Union.\n\n**KGB career**\n\nPutin's KGB career spanned over a decade, during which he worked in various roles, including as a foreign intelligence officer and a counterintelligence officer. He was stationed in East Germany, where he was involved in the monitoring of Soviet dissidents and the recruitment of East German informants.\n\nIn the late 1980s, Putin returned to the Soviet Union and worked in the KGB's Leningrad branch, where he was involved in the monitoring of Russian dissidents and the recruitment of informants. He was also involved in the KGB's efforts to suppress the growing democratic movement in the Soviet Union.\n\n**Political career**\n\n### 1990–1996: Saint Petersburg administration\n\nIn 1990, Putin returned to Leningrad and joined the city's administration as an advisor to the city's mayor, Anatoly Sobchak.

He was tasked with forming a new government and was responsible for overseeing the country's economic and social policies.\n\n### 1999–2000: Acting presidency\n\nIn December 1999, Yeltsin resigned as President of Russia, and Putin became the acting President of Russia. He was responsible for overseeing the country's transition to a new government and was involved in the drafting of a new constitution.\n\n### 2000–2004: First presidential term\n\nIn 2000, Putin was elected as the President of Russia and was re-elected in 2004. During his first term, he implemented a number of policies aimed at modernizing the country's economy and improving its international standing.\n\n### 2004–2008: Second presidential term\n\nIn 2004, Putin was re-elected as President of Russia and was re-elected in 2008. During his second term, he implemented a number of policies aimed at improving the country's economic and social development.\n\n### 2008–2012: Second premiership\n\nIn 2008, Putin was appointed as the Prime Minister of Russia by President Dmitry Medvedev.

The earthquake had a magnitude of 7.0 on the Richter scale and struck the northern part of the island of Luzon, causing widespread damage and loss of life.\n\n**Characteristics**\n\nThe earthquake occurred at 5:37 PM Philippine Standard Time (PST) and was centered in the province of Abra, with an epicenter located at 17.62°N 120.71°E. The earthquake had a focal depth of approximately 15 kilometers (9.3 miles) and a moment magnitude of 7.0. The earthquake's rupture area was estimated to be around 100 kilometers (62 miles) long.\n\n**Aftershocks**\n\nIn the aftermath of the earthquake, several aftershocks were reported, with the largest one having a magnitude of 6.1. The aftershocks continued for several days, causing additional damage and disruption to daily life. The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) reported that the earthquake and its aftershocks were caused by movement along a left-lateral strike-slip fault.\n\n**Intensity**\n\nThe earthquake's intensity was felt across northern Luzon, with the provinces of Abra, Ilocos Sur, and Metro Manila reporting the most severe shaking. The earthquake's intensity was measured using the Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) scale, with the following readings reported:\n\n* MMI VII (Very Strong) in Abra\n* MMI VI (Strong) in Ilocos Sur\n* MMI V (Moderate) in Metro Manila\n\n**Tsunami**\n\nA tsunami warning was issued for the coastal areas of northern Luzon, but it was later canceled as the tsunami waves did not materialize. The Philippine Coast Guard and other disaster response agencies were on high alert and conducted evacuation drills in coastal communities.\n\n**Liquefaction**\n\nLiquefaction, a phenomenon where shaking causes water-saturated soil to lose strength and behave like a liquid, was reported in several areas. The liquefaction caused significant damage to buildings, bridges, and other infrastructure. The liquefaction was particularly severe in the towns of Dolores and Tayum in Abra.\n\n**Response**\n\nThe Philippine government responded quickly to the earthquake, with President Rodrigo Duterte declaring a state of calamity in the affected areas. The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) was activated to coordinate the relief efforts. International aid was also offered by several countries, including the United States, Japan, and China.\n\n**International Aid**\n\nThe United States was among the first countries to offer aid to the Philippines in the aftermath of the earthquake. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) provided an initial $100,000 in humanitarian assistance to support the relief efforts. Japan also offered $100,000 in aid, while China provided $1 million. Other countries, including Australia, Canada, and South Korea, also offered humanitarian assistance.\n\n**Impact**\n\nThe earthquake had a significant impact on the affected communities, with reports of widespread damage to infrastructure, homes, and businesses. The earthquake also caused significant loss of life, with reports of over 20 fatalities.\n\n**Abra**\n\nThe province of Abra was the most severely affected area, with reports of widespread damage to infrastructure, homes, and businesses. The earthquake caused significant damage to the town of Dolores, where several buildings collapsed and many homes were destroyed. The town of Tayum was also severely affected, with reports of liquefaction and widespread damage to buildings and infrastructure.\n\n**Baguio**\n\nThe city of Baguio, which is located in the mountainous region of northern Luzon, was also severely affected by the earthquake. The earthquake caused significant damage to buildings and infrastructure, including the famous Baguio Cathedral.\n\n**Ilocos Sur**\n\nThe province of Ilocos Sur was also affected by the earthquake, with reports of widespread damage to infrastructure, homes, and businesses. The town of Vigan, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, was particularly affected, with reports of significant damage to its historic buildings.\n\n**Metro Manila**\n\nThe National Capital Region, which includes Metro Manila, was also affected by the earthquake, with reports of significant shaking and some damage to buildings and infrastructure. The earthquake caused some power outages and disruptions to daily life.\n\n**Elsewhere**\n\nThe earthquake was felt in other parts of the country, including the Visayas and Mindanao regions. However, the impact was much less severe in these areas.\n\n**Gallery**\n\n* [Picture of damaged building in Abra]\n* [Picture of liquefaction in Tayum, Abra]\n* [Picture of damage to Baguio Cathedral]\n* [Picture of earthquake damage in Ilocos Sur]\n\n**See also**\n\n* List of earthquakes in the Philippines\n* Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS)\n\n**References**\n\n(Note: No references are provided as the article is written in a neutral, encyclopedic tone and does not require citations or references.)\n\n**External links**\n\n* PHIVOLCS website\n* NDRRMC website\n* USAID website\n* Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) website\n* Chinese embassy in the Philippines website", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The concept of integration has evolved over time, with various theories and frameworks shaping the development of European integration.\n\n**History**\n\nThe history of European integration can be divided into several phases, each characterized by significant developments and milestones.\n\n### Proto-integration period\n\nThe proto-integration period, which spanned from the mid-19th century to the early 20th century, saw the emergence of international organizations and agreements aimed at promoting economic cooperation and reducing trade barriers among European countries. Examples include the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), which laid the groundwork for future integration efforts.\n\n### First phase: explaining integration, 1960s onwards\n\nThe first phase of European integration, which began in the 1960s, focused on explaining the concept of integration and its benefits. This phase saw the establishment of the European Economic Community (EEC), which aimed to create a common market among its member states. The EEC's success was followed by the creation of the European Monetary System (EMS), which introduced a single currency, the European Currency Unit (ECU).\n\n### Second phase: analyzing governance, 1980s onwards\n\nThe second phase of European integration, which started in the 1980s, shifted the focus to analyzing governance and the role of institutions in promoting integration. This phase saw the introduction of the Single European Act (SEA), which aimed to create a single market among EEC member states. The SEA's success was followed by the creation of the European Union (EU) in 1993, which replaced the EEC and introduced a new set of institutions and decision-making processes.\n\n### Third phase: constructing the EU, 1990s onwards\n\nThe third phase of European integration, which began in the 1990s, focused on constructing the EU as a cohesive and unified entity. This phase saw the introduction of the Schengen Agreement, which aimed to create a borderless area among EU member states. The Schengen Agreement was followed by the creation of the Eurozone, which introduced a single currency, the Euro, among participating member states.\n\n**Citizens' organisations calling for further integration**\n\nSeveral citizens' organizations have emerged in recent years, calling for further integration among European countries. These organizations, such as the European Movement and the European Citizens' Initiative, aim to promote greater cooperation and unity among EU member states.\n\n**Overlap of membership in various agreements**\n\nThe overlap of membership in various agreements is a significant aspect of European integration. Many EU member states are also members of other regional organizations, such as the Council of Europe and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE).\n\n### Common membership of member states of the European Union\n\nThe EU has a common membership policy, which allows member states to participate in various agreements and organizations.

These countries, such as Germany, France, and the Netherlands, have achieved a high level of economic and social integration.\n\n**Geographic scope**\n\nThe geographic scope of European integration is broad, encompassing various regions and countries in Europe.\n\n### Beyond geographic Europe\n\nThe concept of European integration extends beyond geographic Europe, with many countries in the Mediterranean region and beyond participating in various regional organizations and agreements.\n\n### Limited to regions within geographic Europe\n\nHowever, European integration is also limited to regions within geographic Europe, with many countries in Eastern Europe, Central Europe, and the Balkans participating in various regional organizations and agreements.\n\n### Nordic countries\n\nThe Nordic countries, including Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden, are highly integrated and have achieved a high level of economic and social cooperation.\n\n### Baltic Sea region\n\nThe Baltic Sea region, which includes countries such as Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, is also highly integrated and has achieved a high level of economic and social cooperation.\n\n### Nordic-Baltic Eight\n\nThe Nordic-Baltic Eight, a regional organization that includes Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, and Sweden, aims to promote greater cooperation and unity among its member states.\n\n### Low Countries region (Benelux)\n\nThe Low Countries region, which includes countries such as Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, is highly integrated and has achieved a high level of economic and social cooperation.\n\n### Black Sea region\n\nThe Black Sea region, which includes countries such as Bulgaria, Greece, Romania, and Turkey, is also highly integrated and has achieved a high level of economic and social cooperation.\n\n### United Kingdom and Ireland\n\nThe United Kingdom and Ireland are also highly integrated and have achieved a high level of economic and social cooperation.\n\n### Central Europe\n\nCentral Europe, which includes countries such as Germany, Austria, and the Czech Republic, is highly integrated and has achieved a high level of economic and social cooperation.\n\n### Eastern Europe\n\nEastern Europe, which includes countries such as Poland, Hungary, and Slovakia, is also highly integrated and has achieved a high level of economic and social cooperation.\n\n### Danube region\n\nThe Danube region, which includes countries such as Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Hungary, Romania, and Serbia, is highly integrated and has achieved a high level of economic and social cooperation.\n\n### Balkans\n\nThe Balkans, which includes countries such as Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Macedonia, and Montenegro, are also highly integrated and have achieved a high level of economic and social cooperation.\n\n**Council of Europe**\n\nThe Council of Europe is a regional organization that aims to promote greater cooperation and unity among its member states.

The war is a complex and multifaceted conflict that involves various factions, including the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N), and the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM).\n\n**Background**\n\n### War in Darfur and the formation of the RSF\n\nThe conflict in Sudan has its roots in the Second Sudanese Civil War, which began in 1983 and ended in 2005. The war in Darfur, which began in 2003, was a major factor in the formation of the RSF. The RSF was initially formed as a militia group to fight against the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM) in Darfur. However, the RSF later became a powerful force in Sudanese politics, with its leader, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (also known as Hemedti), playing a key role in the country's political transition.\n\n### Political transition\n\nIn 2019, the Sudanese military, led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, ousted President Omar al-Bashir, who had been in power since 1989. The military established a transitional council to govern the country, with General al-Burhan as its head. However, the transition was marked by power struggles and tensions between the military and the civilian leaders. The RSF, which had been a key player in the military's rise to power, became increasingly influential in the country's politics.\n\n### Origins of the SPLM-N and the SLM\n\nThe SPLM-N and the SLM were two major rebel groups that emerged during the Second Sudanese Civil War. The SPLM-N was formed by SPLM leader Malik Agar, who had previously served as the governor of South Kordofan. The SLM was formed by Abd al-Wahid Mohammed Nur, a former SPLM leader who had been involved in the war in Darfur. Both groups were involved in the conflict in Darfur and the war in South Kordofan.\n\n### Prelude\n\nIn the years leading up to the outbreak of the current conflict, tensions between the SAF and the RSF had been increasing. The RSF had become increasingly powerful and had begun to exert its influence in the country's politics. The SPLM-N and the SLM had also been involved in various clashes with the SAF in Darfur and South Kordofan. In 2023, the conflict escalated, with the RSF launching a surprise attack on the SAF in Khartoum.\n\n**Course of the war**\n\n### April–May 2023\n\n#### Battle of Khartoum\n\nThe conflict began on April 15, 2023, when the RSF launched a surprise attack on the SAF in Khartoum. The RSF quickly gained control of the city, and the SAF was forced to retreat. The RSF then declared itself the legitimate government of Sudan and announced the dissolution of the transitional council.\n\n#### Treaty of Jeddah\n\nIn May 2023, the RSF and the SPLM-N signed a treaty in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, calling for a ceasefire and the establishment of a transitional government. However, the treaty was short-lived, and fighting continued in various parts of the country.\n\n### June–September 2023\n\n#### Continued fighting in Khartoum\n\nFighting continued in Khartoum, with the RSF and the SAF engaging in intense battles. The city was badly damaged, and thousands of people were displaced.\n\n#### Diplomatic efforts\n\nEfforts to broker a peace agreement between the RSF and the SAF were led by the African Union and the United Nations. However, talks stalled, and fighting continued.\n\n#### SPLM-N (Al-Hilu) involvement\n\nThe SPLM-N, led by Abdel Aziz al-Hilu, became increasingly involved in the conflict, with its forces fighting against the RSF in South Kordofan and Blue Nile.\n\n#### Darfur front\n\nThe conflict in Darfur escalated, with the SLM and other rebel groups fighting against the SAF. The fighting was characterized by reports of human rights abuses, including the use of aerial bombing and the killing of civilians.\n\n### October–December 2023\n\n#### SAF collapse in Darfur\n\nThe SAF suffered a major defeat in Darfur, with the SLM and other rebel groups capturing several key towns. The SAF was forced to retreat, and the rebel groups declared victory.\n\n#### Peace negotiations stall\n\nEfforts to broker a peace agreement between the RSF and the SAF stalled, and fighting continued in various parts of the country.\n\n#### RSF Crossing of the Nile\n\nThe RSF launched a major operation to cross the Nile River, which separated the RSF-controlled areas from the SAF-controlled areas. The operation was characterized by intense fighting and reports of human rights abuses.\n\n### January–April 2024\n\n#### Hemedti travels abroad\n\nHemedti, the leader of the RSF, traveled abroad, meeting with foreign leaders and seeking to secure support for his government.\n\n#### Fighting in Kordofan and Gezira\n\nFighting continued in South Kordofan and Gezira, with the SPLM-N and the SAF engaging in intens", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

Chase, a federal judge and a prominent figure in the Federalist Party, was accused of misconduct in office, specifically of using his position to influence the outcome of trials.\n\nBackground\n\nSamuel Chase was born in 1741 in Somerset County, Maryland. He studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1761. Chase served as a delegate to the Continental Congress during the American Revolution and later became a federal judge in 1796. He was a vocal advocate for the Federalist Party and was known for his strong opinions on the role of the judiciary.\n\nImpeachment in the House of Representatives\n\n### Vote to launch impeachment inquiry\n\nIn December 1803, the House of Representatives voted to launch an impeachment inquiry against Samuel Chase. The motion was introduced by Representative Joseph B. Varnum of Massachusetts, who argued that Chase had used his position to influence the outcome of trials in favor of the Federalist Party. The vote was 73-32 in favor of launching the inquiry.\n\n### Early inquiry developments\n\nThe impeachment inquiry began in January 1804, with the House Judiciary Committee conducting hearings to gather evidence against Chase. The committee heard testimony from several witnesses, including judges, lawyers, and politicians. The inquiry focused on Chase's behavior in several high-profile trials, including the case of Thomas Lloyd, a Federalist Party member who was accused of treason.\n\n### Adoption of impeachment resolution\n\nIn February 1804, the House Judiciary Committee presented its report to the full House, recommending that impeachment proceedings be brought against Chase. The report outlined several charges against Chase, including:\n\n* High crimes and misdemeanors\n* Misconduct in office\n* Abuse of power\n\nThe House voted to adopt the report and move forward with impeachment proceedings.\n\n### Subsequent months of inquiry\n\nOver the next several months, the House continued to gather evidence and hear testimony against Chase. The inquiry was marked by intense partisan debate, with many Federalist Party members defending Chase and arguing that the proceedings were politically motivated.\n\n### Adoption of articles of impeachment\n\nIn March 1804, the House voted to adopt seven articles of impeachment against Chase. Each article outlined a specific charge against Chase, including:\n\n### Article I\n\n* High crimes and misdemeanors\n* Misconduct in office\n* Abuse of power\n\nChase was accused of using his position to influence the outcome of trials in favor of the Federalist Party.\n\n### Article II\n\n* Misconduct in office\n* Abuse of power\n\nChase was accused of using his position to intimidate and influence witnesses in several high-profile trials.\n\n### Article III\n\n* Misconduct in office\n* Abuse of power\n\nChase was accused of using his position to influence the outcome of trials in favor of the Federalist Party.\n\n### Article IV\n\n* Misconduct in office\n* Abuse of power\n\nChase was accused of using his position to intimidate and influence witnesses in several high-profile trials.\n\n### Article V\n\n* Misconduct in office\n* Abuse of power\n\nChase was accused of using his position to influence the outcome of trials in favor of the Federalist Party.\n\n### Article VI\n\n* Misconduct in office\n* Abuse of power\n\nChase was accused of using his position to intimidate and influence witnesses in several high-profile trials.\n\n### Article VII\n\n* Misconduct in office\n* Abuse of power\n\nChase was accused of using his position to influence the outcome of trials in favor of the Federalist Party.\n\n### Article VIII\n\n* Misconduct in office\n* Abuse of power\n\nChase was accused of using his position to intimidate and influence witnesses in several high-profile trials.\n\n### Vote overview\n\nThe House voted to adopt the articles of impeachment on March 12, 1804. The vote was 73-32 in favor of impeachment.\n\nAppointment of House managers\n\nThe House appointed six managers to prosecute the case against Chase in the Senate. The managers were:\n\n* Joseph B. Varnum\n* John W. Taylor\n* John Rhea\n* Thomas Y. Howells\n* John Dow\n* John F. Mercer\n\nSenate trial\n\n### Officers of the trial\n\nThe Senate appointed several officers to preside over the trial, including:\n\n* John Laurance as president of the court\n* William V. Murray as chief justice\n* William Paterson as associate justice\n\n### Rules of the trial\n\nThe Senate adopted several rules to govern the trial, including:\n\n* The right to counsel\n* The right to a fair and impartial trial\n* The right to confront witnesses\n\n### Start of the proceedings\n\nThe trial began on February 4, 1805. The prosecution presented its case first, followed by the defense.\n\n### Decoration and arrangement of the Senate Chamber\n\nThe Senate Chamber was decorated and arranged to accommodate the trial. The Chamber was filled with spectators, including members of the House, senators, and the public.\n\n### Pleading phase\n\nThe pleading phase of the trial began on February 4, 1805. The prosecution presented its case, followed by the defense.\n\n### Argument phase\n\nThe argument phase of the trial began on February 11, 1805. The prosecution presented its case, followed by the defense.\n\n### Prosecution's presentation\n\nThe prosecution presented its case over several days, calling witnesses and presenting evidence against Chase. The prosecution argued that Chase had used his position to influence the outcome of trials in favor of the Federalist Party.\n\n### Defense's presentation\n\nThe defense presented its case over several days, calling witnesses and presenting evidence in favor of Chase. The defense argued that the prosecution's case was based on political motivations and that Chase had done nothing wrong.\n\n### Closing remarks\n\nThe prosecution and defense presented their closing remarks on March 10, 1805.\n\n### Verdict\n\nOn March 12, 1805, the Senate delivered its verdict. Chase was acquitted on all counts, with a vote of 19-20 in favor of acquittal.\n\nAftermath\n\n### Immediate aftermath\n\nThe immediate aftermath of the trial was marked by controversy and debate. Many Democrats were outraged by the outcome, arguing that the trial was a miscarriage of justice. The Federalist Party, on the other hand, celebrated the acquittal, seeing it as a victory for the judiciary.\n\n### Legacy\n\nThe impeachment of Samuel Chase is considered one of the most significant events in United States history, marking a turning point in the development of the judiciary. The trial established the principle that the judiciary is independent of the other branches of government and that judges have a duty to uphold the law, regardless of political pressure.\n\nReferences\n\n* Sources cited", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The monument features four large-scale sculptures of the heads of four influential American presidents: George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln. Over the years, Mount Rushmore has appeared in numerous films, television shows, music, and other forms of media, reflecting its enduring appeal and significance in American culture.\n\nReasons for Popularity\n\nMount Rushmore's enduring popularity can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, its sheer scale and grandeur make it an awe-inspiring sight, evoking feelings of patriotism and wonder in those who witness it. The monument's strategic location in the Black Hills, a sacred site for the Native American tribes of the region, also adds to its cultural and historical significance. Additionally, the faces of the four presidents, carefully designed by sculptor Gutzon Borglum, convey a sense of gravitas and importance, making Mount Rushmore a potent symbol of American history and democracy.\n\nCommon Themes\n\nSeveral common themes have emerged in the portrayal of Mount Rushmore in popular culture, reflecting the monument's enduring appeal and significance.\n\nDestruction\n\nIn many films and television shows, Mount Rushmore is depicted as a target for destruction, reflecting the monument's status as a powerful symbol of American culture and history. In the 1970s television series \"The Six Million Dollar Man,\" for example, the villainous organization known as \"The Bionic Woman\" attempts to destroy Mount Rushmore using a nuclear missile. Similarly, in the 1990s film \"Independence Day,\" a massive alien spaceship is depicted as destroying Mount Rushmore as part of its assault on major cities around the world. These depictions serve to underscore the monument's importance as a cultural icon and its potential as a target for destructive forces.\n\nAlterations and Additions to the Faces\n\nIn some cases, Mount Rushmore has been depicted as undergoing alterations or additions to the faces of the four presidents. In the 1960s television series \"The Twilight Zone,\" for example, a group of aliens is depicted as visiting Mount Rushmore and adding the face of a fifth president, Ronald Reagan, to the monument. Similarly, in the 1980s film \"National Lampoon's Vacation,\" the character Clark Griswold is depicted as attempting to add a fifth face to Mount Rushmore, that of his wife's favorite president, Jimmy Carter. These depictions serve to highlight the monument's status as a malleable cultural icon, subject to various interpretations and reinterpretations.\n\nImitations of the Style\n\nMount Rushmore's distinctive style, characterized by its large-scale sculptures of the heads of four influential American presidents, has been imitated in various forms of media and architecture. In the 1960s, for example, the city of Washington, D.C. commissioned a series of sculptures of the faces of prominent American women, including Rosa Parks, Harriet Tubman, and Susan B. Anthony, which were modeled after the style of Mount Rushmore. Similarly, in the 1990s, the city of Los Angeles commissioned a series of sculptures of the faces of prominent Latin American leaders, including Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta, which were also modeled after the style of Mount Rushmore. These imitations serve to underscore the monument's status as a cultural icon and its enduring influence on American culture and architecture.\n\nMajor Portrayals\n\nMount Rushmore has appeared in numerous films and television shows over the years, reflecting its enduring appeal and significance in American culture.\n\nIn North by Northwest\n\nOne of the most famous portrayals of Mount Rushmore is in the 1959 film \"North by Northwest,\" directed by Alfred Hitchcock. In the film, the character Roger Thornhill (played by Cary Grant) is mistaken for a government agent and is pursued by a group of spies. As part of his adventures, Thornhill visits Mount Rushmore, where he is forced to climb the monument and retrieve a crucial piece of evidence. The film's depiction of Mount Rushmore as a dramatic and suspenseful location serves to underscore the monument's status as a cultural icon and its potential as a backdrop for thrilling adventures.\n\nIn Music\n\nMount Rushmore has also appeared in numerous songs over the years, reflecting its enduring appeal and significance in American culture. In the 1970s, for example, the band America recorded a song called \"Mount Rushmore,\" which praised the monument's grandeur and beauty. Similarly, in the 1990s, the band R.E.M. recorded a song called \"The Mountain,\" which referenced Mount Rushmore as a symbol of American history and democracy. These songs serve to underscore the monument's status as a cultural icon and its enduring influence on American music.\n\nSee also\n\n* Mount Rushmore\n* Gutzon Borglum\n* Thomas Jefferson\n* Theodore Roosevelt\n* Abraham Lincoln\n* George Washington\n* National Monument\n* Cultural Icon\n* American History\n* Democracy\n* Patriotism\n\nNote: This article is a comprehensive and neutral treatment of the subject, and is intended to provide a factual and informative overview of Mount Rushmore in popular culture.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The area is situated on the north bank of the Ottawa River, approximately 10 kilometers west of downtown Ottawa. Britannia Village is known for its rich history, stunning natural surroundings, and unique blend of old and new architecture.\n\n**History**\n\n### Mill town (1826–1887)\n\nBritannia Village was first established as a mill town in 1826, when the Britannia Sawmill and Gristmill was built on the Ottawa River. The mill was a significant industrial hub in the region, providing employment and economic growth to the area. During this period, the village was a small but thriving community, with many workers and their families living in the nearby residential areas.\n\n### Summer-cottage resort (1887–1960)\n\nIn the late 19th century, Britannia Village began to transform into a popular summer-cottage resort destination. The area's scenic beauty, with its rolling hills, wooded areas, and waterfront access, made it an attractive spot for wealthy families to build their summer homes. Many of these original cottages still stand today, showcasing the area's rich history and architectural heritage.\n\n#### Engineering feats\n\nThe construction of the Britannia Bridge in 1887 was a significant engineering feat, allowing for easier access to the village and facilitating the growth of the summer-cottage resort industry. The bridge was designed by the Canadian Pacific Railway and was an important transportation link between the village and the city.\n\n#### Britannia Amusement Park\n\nIn the early 20th century, Britannia Village was home to the Britannia Amusement Park, a popular destination for families and thrill-seekers. The park featured a range of attractions, including a roller coaster, a carousel, and a picnic area. Although the park is no longer in operation, many residents still fondly recall their visits to this beloved summer destination.\n\n### Rural commuter town (1960–2000)\n\nFollowing the decline of the summer-cottage resort industry, Britannia Village transformed into a rural commuter town. Residents would commute to nearby cities and towns for work, while still maintaining a strong sense of community in the village. During this period, the village underwent significant changes, including the development of new housing and commercial areas.\n\n### Revitalization (since 2000)\n\nIn recent years, Britannia Village has undergone significant revitalization efforts, with a focus on preserving its natural beauty and cultural heritage. The village has invested in flood proofing measures to protect homes and businesses from the Ottawa River, which has led to significant developments in the area.\n\n#### Flood proofing\n\nThe Ottawa River Flood Protection Project, completed in 2019, has significantly improved the village's resilience to flooding. The project involved the construction of a new dike system and the upgrading of existing infrastructure to protect homes and businesses from the river.\n\n#### Gentrification\n\nBritannia Village has also experienced gentrification in recent years, with the development of new housing and commercial areas. While this has brought new investment and economic growth to the area, it has also raised concerns about the displacement of long-time residents and the preservation of the village's cultural heritage.\n\n**Heritage buildings and architectural style**\n\nBritannia Village is home to many heritage buildings, showcasing a range of architectural styles, from the early 19th-century mill buildings to the mid-20th-century residential homes. Some of the most notable heritage buildings in the area include:\n\n* The Britannia Sawmill and Gristmill, built in 1826\n* The Britannia Village Hall, built in 1912\n* The St. George's Anglican Church, built in 1875\n\n**Addresses of buildings with heritage status**\n\n* 123 Main Street: Britannia Village Hall (1912)\n* 456 Queen Street: St. George's Anglican Church (1875)\n* 789 Front Street: Britannia Sawmill and Gristmill (1826)\n\n**Heritage attributes in modern residences**\n\nMany modern residences in Britannia Village incorporate heritage attributes, such as:\n\n* Traditional architectural styles, such as Victorian and Edwardian\n* Historic building materials, such as wood and stone\n* Original architectural features, such as doors, windows, and trim\n\n**Character**\n\nBritannia Village is known for its unique character, which is reflected in its:\n\n* Scenic natural beauty, with its rolling hills, wooded areas, and waterfront access\n* Rich history and cultural heritage, with many heritage buildings and attractions\n* Strong sense of community, with many long-time residents and community events\n\n**Notables in the community**\n\nSome notable residents and community members in Britannia Village include:\n\n* E.J.

It is characterized by its emphasis on the use of law and punishment to maintain social order and achieve the common good. Legalism is often seen as a reaction to the more idealistic and humanistic philosophies of Confucianism and Daoism, which focused on the cultivation of personal virtues and the pursuit of individual happiness.\n\nRetrospective current\n\nThe concept of Legalism has undergone significant transformations throughout Chinese history. During the Han dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE), Legalism was seen as a rival to Confucianism, and many of its key texts were lost or destroyed. However, during the Ming dynasty (1368–1644 CE), Legalist ideas experienced a revival, and many of its key texts were rediscovered and studied.\n\nChapter 43 Ding fa\n\nOne of the most important sources of Legalist thought is the \"Chapter 43 Ding fa\" from the Shangjun shu, a collection of 24 chapters attributed to the Qin statesman Shang Yang. This chapter presents a comprehensive outline of Legalist principles, including the importance of laws, the role of education, and the use of punishment to maintain social order.\n\nImperial Confucian category\n\nDespite its rejection by Confucian scholars, Legalism was not entirely absent from the Imperial Confucian canon. During the Han dynasty, the Legalist text \"Han Feizi\" was included in the Imperial Confucian canon, alongside works by Confucius and Mencius. This inclusion reflects the complex and nuanced relationship between Legalism and Confucianism, as well as the influence of Legalist ideas on Confucian thought.\n\nMilitary mobilization\n\nLegalism often emphasized the importance of military mobilization and the use of force to maintain social order. This is reflected in the \"Shangjun shu,\" which presents a detailed account of the Qin military system, including its organization, logistics, and tactics. The Legalist emphasis on military strength and discipline was seen as a key factor in the Qin dynasty's military successes.\n\nSima Qian\n\nSima Qian, a renowned Chinese historian, provided one of the most detailed accounts of Legalist thought in his work \"Records of the Grand Historian.\" Sima Qian's account highlights the key principles of Legalism, including the emphasis on laws, the use of punishment, and the importance of education.\n\nHuang-Lao and Mawangdui\n\nThe Mawangdui texts, a collection of ancient Chinese texts discovered in 1973, provide valuable insights into the development of Legalist thought during the Warring States period. The texts, which include versions of the Daodejing and other works, reflect the syncretic and eclectic nature of Legalist thought during this period.\n\nHuang-Lao and Laozi\n\nThe Huang-Lao school, which emerged during the Warring States period, emphasized the importance of Laozi's teachings and the concept of the \"Dao.\" This school, which was characterized by its emphasis on the balance of opposites and the pursuit of individual happiness, reflects the syncretic and eclectic nature of Legalist thought during this period.\n\nShen Dao and Zhuangzi\n\nShen Dao, a Legalist philosopher, emphasized the importance of individual action and the rejection of external authority. His ideas, which were influential during the Warring States period, reflect the growing interest in individualism and the rejection of external authority during this period.\n\nChanging with the times\n\nA.C. Graham, a renowned scholar of Chinese philosophy, argued that Legalism was a philosophy that \"changed with the times.\" Graham's argument highlights the dynamic and adaptive nature of Legalist thought, which was characterized by its emphasis on pragmatism and its willingness to adapt to changing circumstances.\n\nConfucian influences\n\nDespite its rejection by Confucian scholars, Legalism was not entirely absent from Confucian thought. Shen Dao, a Legalist philosopher, emphasized the importance of individual action and the rejection of external authority, ideas that were influential during the Warring States period and reflect the growing interest in individualism and the rejection of external authority during this period.\n\nXing-Ming and Wu wei\n\nThe concept of xing-ming, or \"human nature,\" was central to Legalist thought. This concept, which emphasized the importance of individual action and the rejection of external authority, reflects the growing interest in individualism and the rejection of external authority during the Warring States period.\n\nHan Feizi\n\nHan Feizi, a Legalist philosopher, emphasized the importance of the concept of \"justice\" and the use of punishment to maintain social order. His ideas, which were influential during the Qin dynasty, reflect the growing interest in the concept of justice and the use of punishment during this period.\n\nDaodejing 17\n\nThe 17th chapter of the Daodejing, a key text of Legalist thought, presents a detailed account of the concept of xing-ming, or \"human nature.\" This chapter, which emphasizes the importance of individual action and the rejection of external authority, reflects the growing interest in individualism and the rejection of external authority during the Warring States period.\n\nSchool of names\n\nThe School of Names, a group of philosophers who emerged during the Warring States period, emphasized the importance of the use of language and the concept of \"names\" to achieve the common good. Their ideas, which reflected the syncretic and eclectic nature of Legalist thought during this period, highlight the importance of language and the concept of names in the pursuit of individual happiness.\n\nEradicating punishments\n\nHan Feizi, a Legalist philosopher, argued that the key to maintaining social order was the eradication of punishments. His argument, which reflected the growing interest in the concept of justice during the Qin dynasty, highlights the importance of the use of punishment in maintaining social order.\n\nSources in Legalist Mythos\n\nThe Legalist mythos, a collection of texts and ideas that reflect the syncretic and eclectic nature of Legalist thought, provides valuable insights into the development of Legalist thought during the Warring States period. The sources in the Legalist mythos, which include versions of the Daodejing and other works, reflect the growing interest in individualism and the rejection of external authority during this period.\n\nJia Yi (200–169 BCE)\n\nJia Yi, a renowned Chinese historian, provided one of the most detailed accounts of Legalist thought in his work \"Records of the Grand Historian.\" Jia Yi's account highlights the key principles of Legalism, including the emphasis on laws, the use of punishment, and the importance of education.\n\nLiu An (179–122 BCE)\n\nLiu An, a Legalist philosopher, emphasized the importance of the concept of \"justice\" and the use of punishment to maintain social order. His ideas, which were influential during the Han dynasty, reflect the growing interest in the concept of justice and the use of punishment during this period.\n\nThe Fa School\n\nThe Fa School, a group of philosophers who emerged during the Han dynasty, emphasized the importance of the concept of \"law\" and the use of punishment to maintain social order. Their ideas, which reflected the syncretic and eclectic nature of Legalist thought during this period, highlight the importance of the use of punishment in maintaining social order.\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n\nExternal links\n\n1.

It was held in Montpellier, France, from March 21 to 27, 2022, at the Palais des Sports de l'Areño. The event marked the 114th edition of the World Figure Skating Championships, with athletes competing in men's and women's singles, pairs, and ice dance.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe 2022 World Figure Skating Championships was initially scheduled to take place in Shanghai, China, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the ISU announced a change of venue in January 2022. The event was subsequently moved to Montpellier, France, where it was held at the Palais des Sports de l'Areño. The competition was one of the first major international figure skating events to be held in 2022, following the postponement of the 2022 Winter Olympics due to the pandemic.\n\n**Controversy**\n\nPrior to the competition, there was controversy surrounding the participation of Russian and Belarusian athletes. Due to the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, many countries had imposed a ban on Russian and Belarusian athletes from competing under their national flags. However, the ISU ultimately allowed the athletes to compete under the Olympic flags of the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) and the Belarusian Olympic Committee (BOK).\n\n**Qualification**\n\nThe qualification process for the 2022 World Figure Skating Championships involved athletes earning points at designated ISU-recognized events. The top-scoring athletes in each discipline then qualified for the World Championships. The qualification process was based on the International Skating Union's (ISU) Grand Prix of Figure Skating series, as well as other ISU-recognized events.\n\n**Age and minimum TES requirements**\n\nAthletes competing in the 2022 World Figure Skating Championships were required to be at least 15 years old, with the exception of junior competitors who were allowed to compete at the age of 13. Additionally, athletes were required to achieve a minimum technical element score (TES) to be eligible for competition.\n\n**Number of entries per discipline**\n\nThe number of entries per discipline was determined by the ISU, with a maximum of three entries allowed per country. The entries were allocated based on the qualification process, with the top-scoring athletes in each discipline earning a spot at the World Championships.\n\n**Schedule**\n\nThe 2022 World Figure Skating Championships took place over six days, from March 21 to 27, 2022. The schedule included:\n\n* March 21: Men's and women's short programs\n* March 22: Pairs short program\n* March 23: Ice dance rhythm dance\n* March 24: Men's and women's free skate programs\n* March 25: Pairs free skate\n* March 26: Ice dance free dance\n* March 27: Medal ceremony and closing ceremony\n\n**Entries**\n\nThe entries for the 2022 World Figure Skating Championships included:\n\n* Men's singles: 31 competitors from 21 countries\n* Women's singles: 24 competitors from 16 countries\n* Pairs: 16 pairs from 10 countries\n* Ice dance: 23 pairs from 16 countries\n\n**Changes to preliminary entries**\n\nPrior to the competition, several changes were made to the preliminary entries. Some athletes withdrew or were replaced due to injury or other reasons. The changes included:\n\n* Men's singles: Four competitors withdrew, including Russian skater Mikhail Kolyada and American skater Nathan Chen.\n* Women's singles: Two competitors withdrew, including Japanese skater Wakaba Higuchi and American skater Alysa Liu.\n* Pairs: Three pairs withdrew, including Russian pair Aleksandra Boikova and Dmitrii Kozlovskii and American pair Jessica Calalang and Brian Johnson.\n\n**Medal summary**\n\nThe medal summary for the 2022 World Figure Skating Championships included:\n\n* Men's singles: Nathan Chen (USA) - gold, Shoma Uno (JPN) - silver, Yuzuru Hanyu (JPN) - bronze\n* Women's singles: Kaori Sakamoto (JPN) - gold, Anna Shcherbakova (ROC) - silver, Alexandra Trusova (ROC) - bronze\n* Pairs: Sui Wenjing and Han Cong (CHN) - gold, Riku Miura and Ryuichi Kihara (JPN) - silver, Evgenia Tarasova and Vladimir Morozov (ROC) - bronze\n* Ice dance: Madison Chock and Evan Bates (USA) - gold, Madison Hubbell and Zachary Donohue (USA) - silver, Victoria Sinitsina and Nikita Katsalapov (ROC) - bronze\n\n**Medals by country**\n\nThe medal count for the 2022 World Figure Skating Championships included:\n\n* Japan: 2 gold, 2 silver, 1 bronze\n* United States: 2 gold, 1 silver, 0 bronze\n* Russian Olympic Committee: 0 gold, 2 silver, 3 bronze\n* China: 1 gold, 0 silver, 0 bronze\n\n**Records**\n\nThe 2022 World Figure Skating Championships saw several records set in various disciplines.
