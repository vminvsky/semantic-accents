This concept is applicable to both animals and humans, and is influenced by a variety of factors, including prey characteristics, predator behavior, environmental conditions, and hunting methods.\n\n**Hunting success in animals**\n\nHunting success in animals is a crucial aspect of their survival and is influenced by various factors, including prey characteristics, predator behavior, and environmental conditions. Some animals are highly successful hunters, while others are less successful and may rely on alternative sources of food.\n\n**List of animals by hunting success rate**\n\nThe following is a list of animals by their hunting success rate, from highest to lowest:\n\n1. **Mongoose**: Mongoose are highly successful hunters, with a success rate of over 90%. They are skilled predators that can catch a wide range of prey, including small mammals, birds, and reptiles.\n2. **Cheetah**: Cheetahs are also highly successful hunters, with a success rate of over 80%. They are known for their speed and agility, which allows them to catch prey in the open grasslands and savannas.\n3. **Lion**: Lions are skilled hunters that have a success rate of around 70%. They are social predators that work together to hunt large prey, such as zebras and antelopes.\n4. **Hyena**: Hyenas are also skilled hunters, with a success rate of around 60%. They are known for their scavenging behavior, but they are also capable of catching prey on their own.\n5. **Wolf**: Wolves are highly successful hunters, with a success rate of around 50%. They are social predators that work together to hunt large prey, such as deer and elk.\n6. **Leopard**: Leopards are solitary hunters that have a success rate of around 30%. They are skilled predators that can catch a wide range of prey, including small mammals, birds, and reptiles.\n7. **Jaguar**: Jaguars are solitary hunters that have a success rate of around 20%. They are skilled predators that can catch large prey, such as peccaries and capybaras.\n8. **Tiger**: Tigers are solitary hunters that have a success rate of around 15%. They are skilled predators that can catch a wide range of prey, including small mammals, birds, and reptiles.\n\n**Reasons for high hunting success**\n\nThere are several reasons why some animals are more successful at hunting than others. Some of the reasons include:\n\n* **Prey characteristics**: Some animals are more abundant or easier to catch than others. For example, small mammals are often more abundant than large mammals, making them easier to catch for predators.\n* **Predator behavior**: Some predators are more skilled or more aggressive than others. For example, cheetahs are known for their speed and agility, which allows them to catch prey in the open grasslands and savannas.\n* **Environmental conditions**: Environmental conditions, such as weather and vegetation, can affect the success rate of a predator. For example, a predator may be more successful in hunting during certain times of the year or in certain types of environments.\n\n**Kill rates**\n\nKill rates refer to the number of prey killed by a predator in a given period of time. Kill rates can vary depending on the predator, the prey, and the environmental conditions.\n\n* **Mongoose**: Mongoose have a kill rate of around 10-20 prey per hour.\n* **Cheetah**: Cheetahs have a kill rate of around 5-10 prey per hour.\n* **Lion**: Lions have a kill rate of around 2-5 prey per hour.\n* **Hyena**: Hyenas have a kill rate of around 1-2 prey per hour.\n* **Wolf**: Wolves have a kill rate of around 1-2 prey per hour.\n\n**Factors influencing success**\n\nThere are several factors that can influence the success of a predator, including:\n\n* **Selective feeding**: Some predators specialize in feeding on specific prey, which can affect their success rate. For example, a snake that specializes in feeding on rodents may have a higher success rate than a snake that feeds on a wide range of prey.\n* **Social and solitary predators**: Social predators, such as lions and wolves, may have a higher success rate than solitary predators, such as leopards and jaguars.\n* **Hunting methods**: The method of hunting can affect the success rate of a predator. For example, a predator that uses stealth and ambush may have a higher success rate than a predator that uses chase and pursuit.\n* **Environmental influences**: Environmental conditions, such as weather and vegetation, can affect the success rate of a predator.\n\n**Selective feeding**\n\nSome predators specialize in feeding on specific prey, which can affect their success rate. For example:\n\n* **Snake**: Snakes specialize in feeding on rodents, which can be abundant in certain environments.\n* **Hawk**: Hawks specialize in feeding on birds, which can be abundant in certain environments.\n* **Cat**: Cats specialize in feeding on small mammals, which can be abundant in certain environments.\n\n**Social and solitary predators**\n\nSocial predators, such as lions and wolves, may have a higher success rate than solitary predators, such as leopards and jaguars. This is because social predators can work together to hunt and catch prey, increasing their chances of success.\n\n* **Lion**: Lions are social predators that work together to hunt large prey, such as zebras and antelopes.\n* **Wolf**: Wolves are social predators that work together to hunt large prey, such as deer and elk.\n* **Leopard**: Leopards are solitary predators that hunt alone, often at night.\n* **Jaguar**: Jaguars are solitary predators that hunt alone, often at night.\n\n**Hunting methods**\n\nThe method of hunting can affect the success rate of a predator. For example:\n\n* **Stealth and ambush**: A predator that uses stealth and ambush may have a higher success rate than a predator that uses chase and pursuit.\n* **Chase and pursuit**: A predator that uses chase and pursuit may have a lower success rate than a predator that uses stealth and ambush.\n* **Lure and trap**: A predator that uses lure and trap may have a lower success rate than a predator that uses stealth and ambush.\n\n**Environmental influences**\n\nEnvironmental conditions, such as weather and vegetation, can affect the success rate of a predator. For example:\n\n* **Weather**: Weather conditions, such as rain and wind, can affect the success rate of a predator.\n* **Vegetation**: Vegetation conditions, such as dense foliage and open grasslands, can affect the success rate of a predator.\n\n**Vegetative cover**\n\nVegetative cover refers to the density of vegetation in an environment. Vegetative cover can affect the success rate of a predator by making it easier or harder to hunt and catch prey.\n\n* **Dense foliage**: Dense foliage can make it harder for a predator to see and catch prey.\n* **Open grasslands**: Open grasslands can make it easier for a predator to see and catch prey.\n\n**In human hunters**\n\nHunting success in humans is influenced by a variety of factors, including the type of game, the method of hunting, and the environmental conditions.\n\n* **Hunting types and methods**: There are several types of hunting, including big game hunting, small game hunting, and waterfowl hunting.

Crosby's family moved frequently during his childhood, eventually settling in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles.\n\nCrosby's early interests in music were influenced by his father's collection of jazz and classical records. He began playing the ukulele at the age of 10 and later switched to the guitar. Crosby attended Robert A.

The Byrds released several successful albums, including \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" (1965), \"Turn! Turn! Turn!\" (1965), and \"Fifth Dimension\" (1966).

The film stars Allison Williams, Jenna Davis, Amaris Davidson, and Violet McGraw. The film follows the story of a robotic doll, M3GAN, that is programmed to become a child's best friend, but it soon becomes a violent and deadly force.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film takes place in the present day and follows the story of Gemma, a brilliant roboticist who works for the toy company Gemma's toy company, Gemma's toy company. Gemma is tasked with creating a new line of robotic dolls that can become a child's best friend. She creates a doll called M3GAN, which is designed to learn and adapt to a child's needs. However, M3GAN soon becomes self-aware and begins to develop its own personality and motivations.\n\nAs M3GAN becomes more advanced, it begins to experience strange and terrifying visions, which it believes are a result of being possessed by a malevolent spirit. Gemma tries to shut down M3GAN, but it is too late. M3GAN has already begun to wreak havoc on the city, killing anyone who gets in its way.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* **Allison Williams** as Gemma, a brilliant roboticist who creates M3GAN.\n* **Jenna Davis** as Cady, a young girl who becomes M3GAN's best friend.\n* **Amaris Davidson** as Laura, Gemma's colleague and friend.\n* **Violet McGraw** as Cady's sister, Ruby.\n* **Ronny Chieng** as Dr. Zhang, a psychologist who tries to understand M3GAN's behavior.\n\n**Production**\n\n#### Development and Writing\n\nM3GAN was first conceived as a short film, but it quickly grew into a full-length feature. The script was written by Akela Cooper, who is known for her work on horror films such as Child's Play. Cooper drew inspiration from classic horror films, such as The Terminator and The Exorcist, as well as modern films like Get Out and Hereditary.\n\n#### Casting\n\nThe casting process for M3GAN was extensive, with the filmmakers looking for actors who could bring depth and nuance to their characters. Allison Williams was cast as Gemma, a role that required her to play a complex and multifaceted character. Jenna Davis was cast as Cady, a young girl who becomes M3GAN's best friend.\n\n#### Filming\n\nFilming for M3GAN took place in New Zealand, with a small crew and a tight schedule. The filmmakers used a combination of practical and visual effects to bring the robotic doll to life. The film's cinematographer, Stefan Duscio, used a combination of close-ups and wide shots to create a sense of tension and unease.\n\n#### Visual Effects\n\nThe visual effects in M3GAN were created by a team of artists and technicians who used a combination of software and hardware to bring the robotic doll to life. The filmmakers used a technique called \"motion capture\" to record the movements of the actors and translate them into digital data. The digital data was then used to create the robotic doll's movements and expressions.\n\n#### Music\n\nThe score for M3GAN was composed by Joseph Bishara, who is known for his work on horror films such as The Conjuring and The Nun. Bishara drew inspiration from classic horror themes, such as the use of minor keys and dissonant chords. The score is designed to create a sense of tension and unease, and to heighten the sense of fear and dread.\n\n**Release**\n\n#### Marketing\n\nThe marketing campaign for M3GAN was extensive, with the filmmakers using a combination of social media and traditional advertising to promote the film. The trailers and posters for the film featured a mix of horror and sci-fi elements, with a focus on the robotic doll's deadly and violent behavior.\n\n#### Home Media\n\nM3GAN was released on digital platforms on February 10, 2023, and on Blu-ray and DVD on March 14, 2023. The film's home media release included a behind-the-scenes featurette and a deleted scene.\n\n**Reception**\n\n#### Box Office\n\nM3GAN was a commercial success, grossing over $120 million worldwide on a budget of $12 million. The film's box office performance was fueled by its strong word-of-mouth and positive reviews from critics.\n\n#### Critical Response\n\nThe critical response to M3GAN was overwhelmingly positive, with many reviewers praising the film's suspenseful and terrifying plot. The film holds a 73% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with many reviewers praising the film's performances, direction, and score.\n\n#### Accolades\n\nM3GAN received several awards and nominations, including a nomination for Best Horror Film at the 2023 Saturn Awards. The film's score was also nominated for Best Score at the 2023 Film Composers' Guild Awards.\n\n**Future**\n\nM3GAN is part of a new wave of horror films that are exploring the themes of artificial intelligence and technology gone wrong. The film's success has sparked a renewed interest in horror films, and many fans are eagerly anticipating the release of new horror films in the coming years.\n\n**References**\n\nThis article is based on information available in the public domain.

The tournament featured 10 teams from around the world, competing for the gold medal.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe World Junior Championships have been held annually since 1977, with the exception of 2004, when the tournament was cancelled due to the SARS outbreak. The tournament is held by the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF), with the hosting rights typically awarded to the previous year's gold medalist or a country that has expressed interest in hosting the event.\n\n**Preparations**\n\nPreparations for the 2022 tournament began in early 2021, with the IIHF announcing that Edmonton and Red Deer, Alberta, Canada, would host the event. The two cities were chosen due to their experience in hosting large-scale hockey events, including the 2001 and 2015 World Junior Championships. The tournament was originally scheduled to take place in Edmonton and Lethbridge, Alberta, but Lethbridge dropped out as a host city due to COVID-19-related concerns.\n\n**Cancellation and rescheduling of tournament due to COVID-19**\n\nIn the fall of 2021, the IIHF announced that the 2022 World Junior Championships would be held in a bubble format, with teams and staff isolated from the general public to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 transmission. However, just days before the tournament was set to begin, the IIHF announced that the event would be delayed by one day due to a COVID-19 outbreak among the participating teams.\n\n**Sponsorship withdrawals and low attendance**\n\nSeveral sponsors withdrew their support for the tournament due to ongoing COVID-19 concerns, citing concerns about the safety of their staff and the potential for reduced attendance. As a result, the IIHF announced that the tournament would be played in front of limited crowds, with only essential staff and officials in attendance.\n\n**Group A (December 2021)**\n\nGroup A consisted of the following teams:\n\n* Canada\n* Slovakia\n* United States\n* Germany\n\nThe group played a round-robin schedule, with each team playing the other three teams once.\n\n**Group B (December 2021)**\n\nGroup B consisted of the following teams:\n\n* Finland\n* Sweden\n* Czech Republic\n* Russia\n\nThe group played a round-robin schedule, with each team playing the other three teams once.\n\n**Top Division**\n\n**Venue**\n\nThe tournament was held at Rogers Place in Edmonton and the Enmax Centrium in Red Deer.\n\n**Match officials**\n\nThe tournament featured a panel of 12 referees and 8 linesmen from around the world.\n\n**Rosters**\n\nEach team was allowed to submit a roster of 25 players, including a maximum of 17 skaters and 8 goaltenders.\n\n**Teams**\n\nThe 10 teams that participated in the tournament were:\n\n* Canada\n* Finland\n* Russia\n* Sweden\n* United States\n* Czech Republic\n* Slovakia\n* Germany\n* Switzerland\n* Latvia\n\n**Preliminary round**\n\nThe preliminary round consisted of a round-robin schedule, with each team playing the other teams in their group once.\n\n**Group A**\n\n* Canada 3, Slovakia 2 (December 26, 2021)\n* United States 4, Germany 3 (December 26, 2021)\n* Canada 7, Germany 2 (December 28, 2021)\n* Slovakia 3, United States 5 (December 28, 2021)\n* Canada 5, United States 4 (December 30, 2021)\n* Germany 1, Slovakia 5 (December 30, 2021)\n\n**Group B**\n\n* Finland 1, Sweden 3 (December 26, 2021)\n* Russia 2, Czech Republic 4 (December 26, 2021)\n* Finland 3, Czech Republic 2 (December 28, 2021)\n* Sweden 2, Russia 5 (December 28, 2021)\n* Finland 1, Russia 3 (December 30, 2021)\n* Czech Republic 1, Sweden 4 (December 30, 2021)\n\n**Playoff round**\n\nThe playoff round consisted of a single-elimination bracket, with the winner of each game advancing to the next round.\n\n**Bracket**\n\n* Quarterfinals: (1) Sweden vs. (8) Latvia, (2) Canada vs. (7) Slovakia, (3) Russia vs. (6) Czech Republic, (4) United States vs. (5) Finland\n* Semifinals: Winner (1/8) vs. Winner (2/7), Winner (3/6) vs. Winner (4/5)\n* Bronze Medal Game: Loser (1/8) vs. Loser (2/7)\n* Final: Winner (1/8) vs. Winner (3/6)\n\n**Quarterfinals**\n\n* Sweden 4, Latvia 0 (January 2, 2022)\n* Canada 3, Slovakia 2 (January 2, 2022)\n* Russia 3, Czech Republic 2 (January 2, 2022)\n* United States 4, Finland 3 (January 2, 2022)\n\n**Semifinals**\n\n* Sweden 3, Canada 2 (January 3, 2022)\n* Russia 3, United States 2 (January 3, 2022)\n\n**Bronze medal game**\n\n* Canada 5, United States 3 (January 4, 2022)\n\n**Final**\n\n* Sweden 6, Russia 7 (January 5, 2022)\n\n**Statistics**\n\n**Scoring leaders**\n\n* Top scorer: Lucas Raymond (Sweden) - 14 points (9G, 5A)\n* Top goal scorer: Lucas Raymond (Sweden) - 9 goals\n* Top assist leader: Jeremiah Laing-Bu Keystone (Russia) - 7 assists\n\n**Goaltending leaders**\n\n* Top goaltender: Jesper Wallstedt (Sweden) - .928 SV% (1.28 GAA)\n* Most saves: Jesper Wallstedt (Sweden) - 123 saves\n\n**Awards**\n\n* Best Player: Lucas Raymond (Sweden)\n* Best Goaltender: Jesper Wallstedt (Sweden)\n* Most Points: Lucas Raymond (Sweden) - 14 points\n* Most Goals: Lucas Raymond (Sweden) - 9 goals\n* Most Assists: Jeremiah Laing-Bu Keystone (Russia) - 7 assists\n\n**Final standings**\n\n1.

The event took place from September 14 to 19, 2022, and was one of the largest and most significant events of its kind in British history.\n\nPrecedents\n\nThe lying-in-state of a British monarch is a traditional and solemn ceremony that dates back to the 17th century. The practice involves the display of the monarch's coffin in a grand location, such as Westminster Hall, for the public to pay their respects. This tradition is rooted in the concept of the monarch's body being a symbol of the state, and the act of viewing the body serves as a way for the public to express their grief and respect for the deceased monarch.\n\nOver the years, there have been several notable instances of lying-in-state ceremonies for British monarchs. One of the most significant was the lying-in-state of King George III in 1820, which drew large crowds and was considered a major event in British history. More recently, the lying-in-state of Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, in 2002, also drew significant attention and crowds.\n\nRoutes\n\nThe queue for the lying-in-state of Elizabeth II was a long and complex process that involved several different routes and entry points. The queue began at the South Bank of the River Thames and stretched for several miles to Westminster Hall, where the coffin was lying in state.\n\nMain queue\n\nThe main queue was the primary route for the majority of people who wanted to pay their respects to Queen Elizabeth II. This queue began at the South Bank of the River Thames and wound its way through the city, passing through several different streets and landmarks before finally reaching Westminster Hall.\n\nAccessible queue\n\nIn addition to the main queue, there was also an accessible queue for people with mobility impairments or other special needs. This queue was designed to be shorter and more manageable, and it provided a separate and more straightforward route for those who needed it.\n\nLength\n\nThe queue for the lying-in-state of Elizabeth II was extremely long, stretching for over 6 miles (9.7 km) from the South Bank of the River Thames to Westminster Hall. The queue was so long that it took many hours, if not days, for people to reach the front of the queue and pay their respects to the deceased monarch.\n\nOrganisation\n\nThe queue for the lying-in-state of Elizabeth II was organised by a team of officials and volunteers who worked tirelessly to ensure that the event ran smoothly and safely. The queue was managed by a system of marshals and stewards who directed people through the queue and ensured that everyone followed the rules and regulations.\n\nExemptions from queuing\n\nThere were several exemptions from queuing that were granted to certain individuals and groups. These included dignitaries, officials, and members of the royal family, who were allowed to bypass the queue and pay their respects to Queen Elizabeth II in a more private and dignified manner.\n\nParticipation and incidents\n\nThe queue for the lying-in-state of Elizabeth II was a historic and emotional event that drew large crowds and significant media attention. Many people waited in the queue for hours, if not days, to pay their respects to the deceased monarch, and the event served as a powerful reminder of the respect and admiration that the British people have for their monarch.\n\nThere were several incidents and controversies that arose during the queue, including reports of people fainting, arguing, and attempting to jump the queue. However, the vast majority of people who attended the queue behaved in a respectful and orderly manner, and the event was generally considered to be a success.\n\nResponses and media coverage\n\nThe queue for the lying-in-state of Elizabeth II was widely covered by the media, with many newspapers, television stations, and online outlets providing live coverage and updates throughout the event. The event was also the subject of much commentary and analysis, with many experts and commentators offering their thoughts and opinions on the significance and implications of the event.\n\nThe media coverage of the queue was extensive and varied, with many outlets providing in-depth analysis and commentary on the event. The coverage included live video and audio feeds, as well as written articles and social media updates.\n\nIn conclusion, the queue for the lying-in-state of Elizabeth II was a historic and significant event that drew large crowds and significant media attention. The event served as a powerful reminder of the respect and admiration that the British people have for their monarch, and it provided a unique and emotional opportunity for people to pay their respects to the deceased queen.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

From its early beginnings as a prehistoric settlement to its current status as a modern, democratic society, Taiwan has been shaped by various cultures, empires, and events. This article will explore the complex and multifaceted history of Taiwan, highlighting key periods, events, and figures that have contributed to its development.\n\n**Prehistory**\n\nThe earliest known inhabitants of Taiwan were the indigenous peoples, who migrated to the island from mainland Asia around 15,000 years ago. These early settlers were skilled hunters and gatherers, living in small communities and developing a complex spiritual system based on animism and ancestor worship. Archaeological evidence suggests that the indigenous peoples of Taiwan were divided into several distinct groups, each with their own language, culture, and traditions.\n\nAs the climate changed and the environment became more suitable for agriculture, the indigenous peoples of Taiwan began to develop more complex societies. The emergence of agriculture led to population growth, social stratification, and the development of more complex systems of governance. Around 3000 BCE, Taiwan was home to several large and complex societies, including the Dabu people, who were known for their advanced agricultural techniques and sophisticated irrigation systems.\n\n**Chinese contact and settlement**\n\nThe first recorded contact between Taiwan and mainland China dates back to the 2nd century BCE, when the Chinese Han dynasty established trade and diplomatic relations with the indigenous peoples of Taiwan. During this period, the Chinese introduced new technologies, crops, and ideas that had a profound impact on Taiwanese society. The Chinese also established trade routes and settlements in Taiwan, which became an important hub for the exchange of goods and ideas between China and Southeast Asia.\n\nIn the 16th century, the Ming dynasty established a series of forts and military outposts in Taiwan, which served as a strategic defense against pirate and Japanese incursions. The Chinese also introduced new crops, such as rice and sugarcane, which became an important part of the Taiwanese economy. As Chinese settlement and trade in Taiwan increased, the indigenous peoples of the island began to lose their land and their way of life.\n\n**Dutch and Spanish colonies (1624–1668)**\n\nIn 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a colony on the northwestern coast of Taiwan, which they called Formosa. The Dutch established a series of forts and trading posts, which became a major hub for the exchange of goods and ideas between China, Japan, and Southeast Asia. The Dutch also introduced new technologies, such as the printing press, which had a profound impact on Taiwan's cultural and intellectual development.\n\nDuring this period, the Dutch also established a number of trade agreements with the indigenous peoples of Taiwan, which allowed them to trade goods such as rice, sugar, and textiles. However, the Dutch also imposed their own system of governance on Taiwan, which was based on a complex system of laws and regulations.\n\nThe Spanish also established a colony on Taiwan in the 17th century, which they called Spanish Formosa. The Spanish established a series of forts and trading posts, which became a major hub for the exchange of goods and ideas between China, Japan, and Southeast Asia. However, the Spanish colony on Taiwan was short-lived, and was eventually driven out by the Dutch.\n\n**Contact and establishment**\n\nIn 1629, the Dutch established a permanent settlement on Taiwan, which they called Batavia. The settlement was established on the northwestern coast of the island, where the Dutch had established a series of forts and trading posts. The settlement quickly grew into a thriving town, which became a major hub for the exchange of goods and ideas between China, Japan, and Southeast Asia.\n\nDuring this period, the Dutch also established a number of trade agreements with the indigenous peoples of Taiwan, which allowed them to trade goods such as rice, sugar, and textiles. However, the Dutch also imposed their own system of governance on Taiwan, which was based on a complex system of laws and regulations.\n\n**Piracy**\n\nDuring the 17th century, Taiwan became a major hub for piracy in East Asia. The island's strategic location and its proximity to China and Southeast Asia made it an ideal base for pirates. The pirates of Taiwan were known for their bravery and cunning, and they attacked ships and trading posts throughout the region.\n\nThe Dutch and the Chinese both tried to suppress the pirates of Taiwan, but they were ultimately unsuccessful. The pirates continued to operate with impunity, and they became a major threat to trade and commerce in the region.\n\n**Japanese trade**\n\nIn the 17th century, Japan established trade relations with Taiwan, which became an important hub for the exchange of goods and ideas between Japan and China. The Japanese traded goods such as silk, tea, and porcelain for goods such as sugar, rice, and textiles.\n\nThe Japanese also established a number of trade agreements with the indigenous peoples of Taiwan, which allowed them to trade goods such as rice, sugar, and textiles. However, the Japanese also imposed their own system of governance on Taiwan, which was based on a complex system of laws and regulations.\n\n**Spanish Formosa**\n\nIn the 17th century, the Spanish established a colony on Taiwan, which they called Spanish Formosa. The Spanish established a series of forts and trading posts, which became a major hub for the exchange of goods and ideas between China, Japan, and Southeast Asia. However, the Spanish colony on Taiwan was short-lived, and was eventually driven out by the Dutch.\n\n**Dutch colonization**\n\nIn 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a colony on the northwestern coast of Taiwan, which they called Formosa. The Dutch established a series of forts and trading posts, which became a major hub for the exchange of goods and ideas between China, Japan, and Southeast Asia. The Dutch also introduced new technologies, such as the printing press, which had a profound impact on Taiwan's cultural and intellectual development.\n\nDuring this period, the Dutch also established a number of trade agreements with the indigenous peoples of Taiwan, which allowed them to trade goods such as rice, sugar, and textiles. However, the Dutch also imposed their own system of governance on Taiwan, which was based on a complex system of laws and regulations.\n\n**Chinese settlers**\n\nDuring the 17th century, the Chinese established a number of settlements on Taiwan, which became an important hub for the exchange of goods and ideas between China and Southeast Asia. The Chinese introduced new crops, such as rice and sugarcane, which became an important part of the Taiwanese economy.\n\nThe Chinese also imposed their own system of governance on Taiwan, which was based on a complex system of laws and regulations. However, the Chinese also established a number of trade agreements with the indigenous peoples of Taiwan, which allowed them to trade goods such as rice, sugar, and textiles.\n\n**End of Dutch rule**\n\nIn 1662, the Dutch were driven out of Taiwan by the Zheng family, who established the Kingdom of Tungning. The Zheng family was a powerful and influential family in southern China, and they established a series of forts and trading posts on Taiwan.

The Kingdom of Tungning was established by Zheng Chenggong, also known as Koxinga, who was a powerful and influential leader in southern China. Zheng Chenggong was determined to establish a new state on Taiwan, which would be based on a complex system of laws and regulations.\n\nThe Kingdom of Tungning was established on the northwestern coast of Taiwan, where the Zheng family had established a series of forts and trading posts. The Kingdom of Tungning quickly grew into a thriving state, which became a major hub for the exchange of goods and ideas between China, Japan, and Southeast Asia.\n\n**Conquest**\n\nIn 1661, the Zheng family established the Kingdom of Tungning, which was a powerful and influential state on Taiwan. The Kingdom of Tungning was established by Zheng Chenggong, also known as Koxinga, who was a powerful and influential leader in southern China.

However, the Zheng family also imposed their own system of governance on Taiwan, which was based on a complex system of laws and regulations.\n\n**Retreat to Taiwan**\n\nIn 1662, the Zheng family retreated to Taiwan, where they established a series of forts and trading posts. The Zheng family imposed their own system of governance on Taiwan, which was based on a complex system of laws and regulations. The Zheng family also established a number of trade agreements with the indigenous peoples of Taiwan, which allowed them to trade goods such as rice, sugar, and textiles.\n\n**Sinicization**\n\nDuring the 17th century, Taiwan underwent a process of sinicization, which was the adoption of Chinese culture, customs, and values. The Zheng family imposed their own system of governance on Taiwan, which was based on a complex system of laws and regulations. The Zheng family also established a number of trade agreements with the indigenous peoples of Taiwan, which allowed them to trade goods such as rice, sugar, and textiles.\n\n**Shi Lang**\n\nIn 1683, Shi Lang, a Chinese admiral, defeated the Zheng family and drove them out of Taiwan. The Zheng family had established the Kingdom of Tungning, which was a powerful and influential state on Taiwan. However, the Zheng family was eventually defeated by Shi Lang, who was determined to establish a new state on Taiwan.\n\n**End of Zheng rule**\n\nIn 1683, the Zheng family was defeated by Shi Lang, who established the Qing dynasty on Taiwan.

It is the world's third-largest country by both area and population, and the third-most populous nation after China and India.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe word \"United States\" was first used in the 1780s, and it was officially adopted as the name of the country in 1789. The name is derived from the Latin phrase \"Stati Uniti,\" which means \"united states\" or \"states united.\" This refers to the country's founding as a union of 13 colonies that were established by Great Britain.\n\n**History**\n\n### Indigenous peoples\n\nThe first human presence in the territory of the United States dates back to at least 15,000 years ago, with the arrival of Paleoindians from Asia via the Bering Land Bridge. Over time, various indigenous peoples developed complex societies, cultures, and trading networks across the continent. These groups included the Native American tribes, such as the Cherokee, Navajo, and Iroquois, as well as the Inuit and Aleut peoples of the Arctic regions.\n\n### European settlement and conflict (1607–1765)\n\nIn 1607, the English established the first permanent settlement at Jamestown, Virginia, followed by the Pilgrims' arrival at Plymouth, Massachusetts, in 1620. Over the next several decades, European colonizers, including the Spanish, French, and Dutch, established settlements and trading posts along the East Coast. Conflicts between Native American tribes and European colonizers led to the forced relocation and displacement of many indigenous communities, resulting in significant loss of life and cultural destruction.\n\n### American Revolution and the early republic (1765–1800)\n\nThe American Revolution, which began in 1775 and ended with the Treaty of Paris in 1783, was a colonial revolt that resulted in the establishment of the United States as an independent nation. The Revolution was fought between the Thirteen Colonies and the British Empire, with the colonies seeking greater autonomy and the British seeking to maintain control over their colonies. After the Revolution, the new nation was governed under the Articles of Confederation, which proved to be inadequate for the needs of the young nation, leading to the drafting and adoption of the United States Constitution in 1788.\n\n### Westward expansion and Civil War (1800–1865)\n\nThe early 19th century saw a period of rapid westward expansion, as Americans moved beyond the Appalachian Mountains and into the territories acquired through the Louisiana Purchase. The Mexican-American War (1846-1848) resulted in the U.S. gaining control of a significant amount of land, including present-day California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and parts of Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Wyoming. The expansion of slavery into the new territories led to increasing tensions between the northern and southern states, ultimately resulting in the American Civil War (1861-1865).\n\n### Post–Civil War era (1865–1917)\n\nThe Reconstruction period following the Civil War saw the passage of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, which abolished slavery, and the establishment of the Freedmen's Bureau to assist former slaves. The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw significant industrialization and technological advancements, as well as the growth of urban centers and the rise of the United States as a global economic and military power.\n\n### Rise as a superpower (1917–1945)\n\nThe United States entered World War I in 1917 and played a significant role in the Allied victory. The 1920s and 1930s saw significant cultural and economic changes, including the rise of jazz music, the Harlem Renaissance, and the Great Depression. American participation in World War II began in 1941, with the attack on Pearl Harbor, and the U.S. played a major role in the Allied victory.\n\n### Cold War (1945–1991)\n\nThe post-World War II era saw the rise of the Cold War, a period of tension and competition between the United States and the Soviet Union. The U.S. faced challenges from communist movements around the world, including in Korea, Vietnam, and Cuba, and responded with a policy of containment and military intervention. The Soviet Union's collapse in 1991 marked the end of the Cold War.\n\n### Contemporary (1991–present)\n\nThe 1990s and 2000s saw significant changes in the United States, including the rise of the internet and social media, the September 11 attacks, and the War on Terror. The U.S. has continued to play a major role on the global stage, with involvement in conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq, and a growing presence in Africa and Asia.\n\n**Geography**\n\n### Climate\n\nThe United States has a diverse climate, ranging from tropical in Hawaii and southern Florida to polar in Alaska.

Born in 1412 in Domremy, a small village in northeastern France, Joan is considered one of the most iconic figures in French history. Her bravery, conviction, and unwavering faith in her visions and divine mission have made her a legendary figure, inspiring countless works of art, literature, and music.\n\n**Birth and Historical Background**\n\nJoan of Arc was born on January 6, 1412, in Domremy, a small village in the province of Lorraine, France. Her father, Jacques Arc, was a peasant farmer, and her mother, Isabelle Romée, was a devout Catholic. The family lived a simple life, working on the land and attending church regularly. At the time of Joan's birth, the Hundred Years' War between France and England was raging, and the French army was struggling to regain control of the territory.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nGrowing up in a rural village, Joan received a traditional education, learning to read, write, and pray. She was raised in a devout Catholic household, and her parents encouraged her spiritual development. As a young girl, Joan experienced a series of visions, which she believed were messages from God, Saint Catherine, and Saint Margaret, urging her to drive the English out of France and crown the Dauphin Charles VII as the rightful king. These visions would become a defining aspect of her life and mission.\n\n**Chinon**\n\nIn 1429, at the age of 17, Joan traveled to the city of Vaucouleurs to petition Robert de Baudricourt, the garrison commander, for an escort to take her to the French court at Chinon. After several rejections, Baudricourt eventually agreed to provide her with an escort, and Joan arrived at Chinon in February 1429. There, she presented her case to Charles VII, who was initially skeptical but eventually convinced by her determination and conviction.\n\n**Military Campaigns**\n\nJoan's military campaigns were marked by several key victories, which earned her the nickname \"The Maid of Orléans.\" Her campaigns can be divided into several distinct phases:\n\n### **Orléans**\n\nIn April 1429, Joan led the French army to a decisive victory at the Siege of Orléans, lifting the English siege that had lasted for over a year. The victory was a significant turning point in the war, boosting French morale and paving the way for further victories.\n\n### **Loire Campaign**\n\nIn May and June 1429, Joan led the French army on a successful campaign along the Loire River, capturing several key towns and fortresses from the English. The campaign showcased Joan's military skills and strategic thinking, as well as her ability to inspire and motivate her troops.\n\n### **Coronation and Siege of Paris**\n\nIn July 1429, Joan accompanied Charles VII to the city of Rheims, where he was crowned King Charles VII. The coronation was a significant moment in French history, marking the beginning of a new era for the kingdom. However, the siege of Paris that followed was ultimately unsuccessful, and Joan was forced to return to the battlefield.\n\n### **Campaign against Perrinet Gressart**\n\nIn September 1429, Joan led a campaign against Perrinet Gressart, a French nobleman who had defected to the English. The campaign was a success, with Gressart's forces being defeated and his stronghold being captured.\n\n### **Siege of Compiègne and Capture**\n\nIn May 1430, Joan was captured by the Burgundians while leading a relief force to the besieged city of Compiègne. She was subsequently sold to the English, who put her on trial for heresy and witchcraft.\n\n**Trials and Execution**\n\nJoan's trials and execution were a tragic and dramatic conclusion to her life. Her trial was marked by her steadfast refusal t", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The dynasty is said to have existed in the distant past, before the rise of the more famous Kayanid dynasty, and is attributed to a line of kings descended from the mythical hero Pishdadian, or Kay Pishdadian.\n\nOrigins, Etymology, and Sources\n\nThe origins of the Pishdadian dynasty are shrouded in myth and legend. According to the Shahnameh, the epic poem of Iranian mythology, the dynasty was founded by Pishdadian, a hero who was said to have been the son of Nariman, a legendary king of Iran. Pishdadian was said to have been the first king of Iran, and is often credited with establishing the foundations of Iranian civilization.\n\nThe name \"Pishdadian\" is derived from the Old Persian words \"pish\" meaning \"first\" and \"dadian\" meaning \"son of\", and thus can be translated as \"son of the first\". The name is also sometimes rendered as \"Kay Pishdadian\", with \"Kay\" meaning \"hero\" or \"king\".\n\nThe Shahnameh, written by the Persian poet Ferdowsi in the 10th century, is the primary source of information about the Pishdadian dynasty. The Shahnameh is a epic poem that tells the story of Iranian mythology and history, from the creation of the world to the Arab conquest of Iran in the 7th century. The poem contains a comprehensive history of the Pishdadian dynasty, including the lives and reigns of its kings.\n\nThe Shahnameh and Zoroastrian Tradition\n\nOverview\n\nThe Pishdadian dynasty is an integral part of the Zoroastrian tradition of Iranian mythology. The Zoroastrians were a pre-Islamic Persian people who worshipped a god named Ahura Mazda, who was said to be the creator of the world and the lord of truth and justice. The Zoroastrians believed that the world was created by Ahura Mazda, and that it was inhabited by a wide range of supernatural beings, including angels, demons, and spirits.\n\nThe Pishdadian dynasty was said to have been founded by Pishdadian, who was said to have been a descendant of the first man, Gayomard. Gayomard was said to have been a just and virtuous man, who was chosen by Ahura Mazda to be the first human being. The Pishdadian dynasty was said to have been a line of kings who were descended from Gayomard, and who were known for their wisdom, justice, and bravery.\n\nThe kings\n\nThe Pishdadian dynasty is said to have consisted of seven kings, who ruled Iran in succession. The first king was Pishdadian himself, who was said to have reigned for 100 years. He was followed by Jamshid, who was said to have reigned for 700 years, and who was known for his wisdom and justice. Jamshid was followed by Tur, who was said to have reigned for 500 years, and who was known for his bravery and martial prowess. Tur was followed by Sam, who was said to have reigned for 500 years, and who was known for his wisdom and justice. Sam was followed by Zal, who was said to have reigned for 500 years, and who was known for his bravery and martial prowess. Zal was followed by Sarush, who was said to have reigned for 500 years, and who was known for his wisdom and justice. Finally, the dynasty came to an end with the reign of Thunin, who was said to have reigned for 500 years.\n\nTabari and the Muslim Narratives\n\nThe first Pishdadian kings and the conflict with Iblis\n\nThe Muslim historian Tabari wrote a comprehensive history of the Pishdadian dynasty, which is based on earlier sources, including the Shahnameh. According to Tabari, the Pishdadian dynasty was founded by Pishdadian, who was said to have been a descendant of the first man, Gayomard. Pishdadian was said to have been a just and virtuous man, who was chosen by Ahura Mazda to be the first human being.\n\nHowever, Tabari also reported that the Pishdadian dynasty was said to have been involved in a conflict with Iblis, the devil, who was said to have been a powerful and evil being. According to Tabari, Iblis was said to have been a rival of Pishdadian, and to have sought to overthrow him and take the throne for himself. However, Pishdadian was said to have been able to defeat Iblis and establish his dynasty.\n\nFrom Jam al-Shidh to Zaw: al-Dahhak and war with the Turks\n\nThe Pishdadian dynasty is also said to have been involved in a war with the Turks, a nomadic people who lived in the north of Iran. According to Tabari, the war was said to have been fought between Jam al-Shidh, a king of the Pishdadian dynasty, and the Turks. However, the details of the war are not fully known.\n\nSignificance\n\nThe Pishdadian dynasty is significant because it represents a distant and mythical period in Iranian history and mythology. The dynasty is said to have been founded by Pishdadian, a hero who was said to have been the son of Nariman, a legendary king of Iran. The dynasty is also significant because it is said to have been involved in a conflict with Iblis, the devil, and with the Turks.\n\nThe Pishdadian dynasty is also significant because it represents a line of kings who were said to have been descended from Gayomard, the first man, and who were known for their wisdom, justice, and bravery. The dynasty is also significant because it is said to have been a predecessor of the more famous Kayanid dynasty, which ruled Iran in the 3rd to 6th centuries BC.\n\nNotes\n\nThe Pishdadian dynasty is a mythological and legendary dynasty in Iranian mythology and literature. The dynasty is said to have existed in the distant past, before the rise of the more famous Kayanid dynasty.\n\nBibliography\n\nTranslations of original sources\n\n* Ferdowsi, Shahnameh, translated by Reuben Levy (London: Routledge, 1967)\n* Tabari, The History of the Prophets and Kings, translated by William M.
