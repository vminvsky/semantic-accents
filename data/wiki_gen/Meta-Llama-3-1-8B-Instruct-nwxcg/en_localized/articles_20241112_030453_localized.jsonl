The election took place from February to March 2023, with the winner succeeding Nicola Sturgeon as party leader.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe SNP leadership election was triggered by Nicola Sturgeon's announcement in February 2023 that she would be stepping down as party leader. The election was expected to be a contentious and closely watched contest, given the SNP's role in promoting Scottish independence and its significant influence in Scottish politics.\n\n**Issues**\n\nThe SNP leadership election was marked by several key issues that dominated the campaign. These issues included:\n\n### **Economics**\n\nOne of the key areas of contention during the campaign was the SNP's economic policy. The party has long advocated for a more socialist approach to economics, but there were divisions within the party on how to achieve this goal. Some candidates, such as Kate Forbes, advocated for a more radical approach to economic policy, while others, such as Humza Yousaf, took a more cautious approach.\n\n### **Independence**\n\nThe issue of Scottish independence was a major factor in the SNP leadership election. The party has long advocated for Scotland to become an independent nation, and the election was seen as an opportunity for candidates to demonstrate their commitment to this goal. However, there were divisions within the party on how to achieve independence, with some candidates advocating for a more gradual approach and others pushing for a more immediate referendum.\n\n### **Gender recognition reform**\n\nAnother key issue during the campaign was the SNP's policy on gender recognition reform. The party has long advocated for reform of the UK's gender recognition laws, but there were divisions within the party on how to achieve this goal. Some candidates, such as Ash Regan, advocated for a more radical approach to reform, while others took a more cautious approach.\n\n**Campaign**\n\nThe SNP leadership election campaign began on February 11, 2023, and lasted for several weeks. The campaign was marked by a series of hustings events, where candidates had the opportunity to debate and discuss their policies with party members.\n\n### **Nomination period**\n\nThe nomination period for the SNP leadership election began on February 11, 2023, and lasted for several days. During this time, candidates had to secure the backing of at least 20 SNP members of the Scottish Parliament or 100 SNP members to be eligible to stand in the election.\n\n### **Kate Forbes**\n\nKate Forbes, a Scottish minister, was one of the first candidates to announce her intention to stand in the election. Forbes was seen as a strong contender for the leadership, given her experience as a minister and her popularity within the party.\n\n### **Ash Regan**\n\nAsh Regan, a Scottish politician, was another candidate who announced her intention to stand in the election. Regan was seen as a strong advocate for Scottish independence and was popular among SNP members.\n\n### **Humza Yousaf**\n\nHumza Yousaf, a Scottish politician, was also a candidate in the election. Yousaf was seen as a strong contender for the leadership, given his experience as a minister and his popularity within the party.\n\n### **Hustings**\n\nThe hustings events were a key part of the SNP leadership election campaign. Candidates had the opportunity to debate and discuss their policies with party members, which helped to shape the direction of the campaign.\n\n### **Row about membership numbers**\n\nThere was a row within the SNP during the campaign about membership numbers. The party's leadership had claimed that membership numbers were at an all-time high, but this was disputed by some candidates and party members. The row highlighted the divisions within the party and added to the tension of the campaign.\n\n**Election process**\n\nThe SNP leadership election was a simple majority system, where the candidate with the most first-preference votes would be declared the winner. If no candidate achieved a majority of first-preference votes, a runoff election would be held between the top two candidates.\n\n**Candidates**\n\nSeveral candidates stood in the SNP leadership election, including:\n\n### **Declared**\n\n* Kate Forbes\n* Ash Regan\n* Humza Yousaf\n\n### **Declined**\n\n* Angus Robertson\n* Michael Matheson\n* Keith Brown\n\n**Endorsements**\n\nSeveral candidates received endorsements from within the party, including:\n\n### **Kate Forbes**\n\n* Nicola Sturgeon\n* Mairi Gouge\n\n### **Ash Regan**\n\n* Patrick Harvie\n* Neil Findlay\n\n### **Humza Yousaf**\n\n* Anas Sarwar\n* Andy Kerr\n\n### **Declined to endorse**\n\n* Kate Forbes\n* Ash Regan\n* Humza Yousaf\n\n**Debates**\n\nThe SNP leadership election was marked by a series of debates and hustings events, where candidates had the opportunity to debate and discuss their policies with party members.\n\n**Hustings**\n\nThe hustings events were a key part of the SNP leadership election campaign. Candidates had the opportunity to debate and discuss their policies with party members, which helped to shape the direction of the campaign.\n\n**Opinion polling**\n\nOpinion polling suggested that the election was a tight contest, with several candidates in contention for the leadership. Polls of SNP members and Scottish public opinion suggested that Kate Forbes, Ash Regan, and Humza Yousaf were the front-runners for the leadership.\n\n### **SNP membership**\n\nPolls of SNP membership suggested that Kate Forbes was the most popular candidate, followed closely by Ash Regan and Humza Yousaf.\n\n### **2021 SNP voters**\n\nPolls of 2021 SNP voters suggested that Ash Regan was the most popular candidate, followed closely by Kate Forbes and Humza Yousaf.\n\n### **Scottish public**\n\nPolls of the Scottish public suggested that Humza Yousaf was the most popular candidate, followed closely by Kate Forbes and Ash Regan.\n\n**Results**\n\nThe results of the SNP leadership election were announced on March 27, 2023. The winner of the election was Humza Yousaf, who secured 52% of first-preference votes. Kate Forbes came second with 28% of first-preference votes, and Ash Regan came third with 20% of first-preference votes.\n\n### **Preference votes by candidate**\n\nThe results of the SNP leadership election were as follows:\n\n| Candidate | First-preference votes | Second-preference votes | Total votes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Humza Yousaf | 52% | 24% | 76% |\n| Kate Forbes | 28% | 15% | 43% |\n| Ash Regan | 20% | 9% | 29% |\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe SNP leadership election was marked by a significant shift in the party's direction. The election of Humza Yousaf as leader marked a significant departure from the previous leadership of Nicola Sturgeon, and was seen as a sign of the party's desire to move in a new direction. The election also highlighted the divisions within the party, and the need for greater unity and cohesion in the lead-up to the next general election.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The event was the thirty-sixth annual Royal Rumble, and it was broadcast live on pay-per-view (PPV) and the WWE Network.\n\n# Production\n\n## Background\n\nThe Royal Rumble is one of WWE's four major annual events, along with WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series. It is named after the traditional battle royal match that takes place at the event, where a large number of wrestlers enter the ring in a predetermined order, with the last person remaining declared the winner. The event has been held annually since 1988, and it is traditionally held in late January or early February.\n\n## Storylines\n\nThe build-up to Royal Rumble 2023 began on WWE's television programs, Monday Night Raw and Friday Night SmackDown, in the weeks leading up to the event. Several storylines emerged, including a feud between Seth Rollins and Kevin Owens, a rivalry between RK-Bro (Randy Orton and Riddle) and The Usos, and a series of matches between wrestlers competing for a spot in the Men's Royal Rumble match.\n\n# Event\n\n## Preliminary matches\n\nThe event kicked off with a match between Rhea Ripley and Naomi on the Kickoff show. Ripley emerged victorious after delivering a Riptide to Naomi. Next up was a match between Santos Escobar and IIconic's Gable Steveson, which Escobar won after a top-rope diving double foot stomp. The final match on the Kickoff show saw Drew McIntyre defeat Chad Gable after a Claymore Kick.\n\n## Main event\n\nThe main event of the evening was the Men's Royal Rumble match, which featured a star-studded lineup of wrestlers, including Roman Reigns, Brock Lesnar, and The Usos.

The match saw several notable eliminations, including Liv Morgan, who was eliminated by Raquel Rodriguez, and Shayna Baszler, who was eliminated by Candice LeRae.\n\n# Reception\n\nThe event received generally positive reviews from fans and critics alike.

Brock Lesnar was the runner-up in the match and vowed to take the title from Reigns at WrestleMania.\n\n## SmackDown\n\nOn Friday Night SmackDown, Kevin Owens defeated Sami Zayn after a Stunner to become the number one contender to the SmackDown Championship.

Over the years, there has been a significant increase in the number of films that feature LGBT characters, reflecting a growing trend towards greater representation and diversity in cinema.\n\n**Early Representation**\n\nThe portrayal of LGBT characters in films dates back to the early days of cinema. In the 1920s and 1930s, Hollywood produced a number of films that featured same-sex relationships, often in the form of subtext or coded language. These films were often produced to appeal to a specific demographic or to push the boundaries of censorship.\n\n### Films of the 1960s and 1970s\n\nThe 1960s and 1970s saw a significant increase in the number of films that featured LGBT characters. Films such as \"The Killing of Sister George\" (1968) and \"Midnight Cowboy\" (1969) featured explicit portrayals of gay relationships, while films like \"Scarecrow\" (1973) and \"The Wild Children\" (1975) explored themes of gay identity.\n\n### Post-Stonewall Era\n\nThe Stonewall riots in 1969 marked a turning point in the LGBT rights movement, leading to increased visibility and representation in the media. The 1980s saw a surge in films that featured LGBT characters, including \"Desert Hearts\" (1985), \"An Early Frost\" (1985), and \"My Beautiful Laundrette\" (1985).\n\n### Contemporary Era\n\nIn recent years, there has been a significant increase in the number of films that feature LGBT characters.

However, I need to point out that the word limit of 4096 words may be challenging to meet while maintaining a neutral and encyclopedic tone. Nevertheless, I'll do my best to provide a comprehensive article within the given outline.\n\n**2023 Estonian parliamentary election**\n\nThe 2023 Estonian parliamentary election was held on March 5, 2023, to elect the 101 members of the Estonian Parliament, known as the Riigikogu. This election marked the first time that Estonia had used a new electoral system, which was designed to promote greater representation of smaller parties.\n\n**Background**\n\nEstonia has a parliamentary system of government, with the Riigikogu serving as the unicameral legislature. The Riigikogu has 101 members, who are elected by proportional representation for a four-year term. The election is typically held in March of the fourth year of each term.\n\nIn the lead-up to the 2023 election, Estonia's politics were dominated by the Centre Party, the Estonian Reform Party, and the Social Democratic Party. The Centre Party had been the largest party in the Riigikogu since 2019, while the Reform Party and the Social Democratic Party were in second and third place, respectively.\n\n**Electoral system**\n\nThe 2023 Estonian parliamentary election used a new electoral system, which was designed to promote greater representation of smaller parties. The system was based on a combination of proportional representation and single-member constituencies.\n\n**Seats by electoral district**\n\nEstonia is divided into 12 electoral districts, each of which corresponds to a single-member constituency. Each district elects one member to the Riigikogu, in addition to the number of members allocated to the district based on the proportion of votes received by each party.\n\nThe 12 electoral districts are:\n\n1. Harju and Rae\n2. Tallinn\n3. Pärnu\n4. Viljandi\n5. Valga\n6. Võru\n7. Jõgeva\n8. Tartu\n9. Põlva\n10. Järva\n11. Lääne\n12. Hiiu\n\n**Pre-election composition**\n\nPrior to the 2023 election, the composition of the Riigikogu was as follows:\n\n* Centre Party: 34 seats\n* Estonian Reform Party: 30 seats\n* Social Democratic Party: 18 seats\n* Conservative People's Party of Estonia: 7 seats\n* Estonian Greens: 6 seats\n* Estonian Free Party: 5 seats\n* Other parties: 1 seat\n\nThe pre-election composition of the Riigikogu reflected the dominance of the Centre Party, which had been the largest party in the legislature since 2019.\n\n**Contesting parties**\n\nA total of 11 parties contested the 2023 Estonian parliamentary election:\n\n1. Centre Party\n2. Estonian Reform Party\n3. Social Democratic Party\n4. Conservative People's Party of Estonia\n5. Estonian Greens\n6. Estonian Free Party\n7. Estonia 200\n8. Isamaa\n9. Estonian United Left Party\n10. Party of People's Unity\n11. Estonia Together\n\n**Party manifestos and slogans**\n\nEach of the 11 parties contesting the election released a manifesto outlining their policies and election promises. Some of the key manifestos and slogans include:\n\n* Centre Party: \"Estonia's future: together we build it\"\n* Estonian Reform Party: \"A new Estonia, a new future\"\n* Social Democratic Party: \"For a stronger, more equal Estonia\"\n* Conservative People's Party of Estonia: \"Traditional values, modern Estonia\"\n* Estonian Greens: \"Estonia for all, for nature, for the future\"\n* Estonian Free Party: \"Free Estonia for everyone\"\n\n**Campaign**\n\nThe 2023 Estonian parliamentary election campaign was marked by a number of key issues, including:\n\n* Economic growth and development\n* Education and healthcare\n* Environmental protection and climate change\n* National security and defense\n* Immigration and integration\n\nThe parties contested the election through a variety of means, including television debates, social media campaigns, and traditional door-to-door canvassing.\n\n**Issues**\n\nSome of the key issues that were raised during the campaign include:\n\n* The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Estonian economy and society\n* The need for greater investment in education and healthcare\n* The importance of environmental protection and climate change mitigation\n* The role of immigration and integration in shaping Estonia's future\n* The need for greater transparency and accountability in government\n\n**Debates**\n\nThe 2023 Estonian parliamentary election campaign featured a number of televised debates between the leaders of the main parties. These debates provided an opportunity for the leaders to outline their policies and election promises, and to engage with each other on key issues.\n\n**Opinion polls**\n\nOpinion polls conducted during the campaign suggested that the Centre Party was likely to remain the largest party in the Riigikogu, followed by the Estonian Reform Party and the Social Democratic Party.\n\n**Results**\n\nThe results of the 2023 Estonian parliamentary election were as follows:\n\n* Centre Party: 31.4% (32 seats)\n* Estonian Reform Party: 28.6% (30 seats)\n* Social Democratic Party: 15.4% (16 seats)\n* Conservative People's Party of Estonia: 6.4% (7 seats)\n* Estonian Greens: 5.6% (6 seats)\n* Estonian Free Party: 4.3% (5 seats)\n* Estonia 200: 3.4% (4 seats)\n* Isamaa: 2.7% (3 seats)\n* Estonian United Left Party: 1.4% (2 seats)\n* Party of People's Unity: 1.1% (1 seat)\n* Estonia Together: 0.7% (1 seat)\n\n**Results by constituency**\n\nThe results of the election also showed that the Centre Party and the Estonian Reform Party performed well in a number of constituencies, including:\n\n* Harju and Rae: Centre Party (42.1%), Estonian Reform Party (31.5%)\n* Tallinn: Centre Party (35.6%), Estonian Reform Party (29.1%)\n* Pärnu: Centre Party (38.5%), Estonian Reform Party (28.2%)\n* Viljandi: Centre Party (32.1%), Estonian Reform Party (26.5%)\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe 2023 Estonian parliamentary election marked a significant shift in the country's politics, with the Centre Party and the Estonian Reform Party emerging as the two largest parties in the Riigikogu.\n\nThe election also highlighted the need for greater cooperation and compromise between the main parties, in order to address the challenges facing Estonia and to build a more stable and effective government.\n\n**Government formation**\n\nFollowing the election, the Centre Party and the Estonian Reform Party began negotiations on forming a government. The negotiations were complex and took several weeks to complete, but ultimately resulted in the formation of a new government led by the Centre Party.\n\nThe government, which was sworn in on April 1, 2023, is composed of ministers from the Centre Party, the Estonian Reform Party, and the Social Democratic Party. The government is committed to implementing a number of key policies, including investments in education and healthcare, and measures to reduce poverty and inequality.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Estonian parliamentary election, 2021\n* Estonian government formation, 2021\n* Estonian politics\n* Government of Estonia\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is intended to provide a neutral and encyclopedic overview of the 2023 Estonian parliamentary election.\n* The article is based on publicly available information and sources.\n* The article is subject to revision and updating as new information becomes available.\n\n**References**\n\n* Estonian Electoral Committee\n* Estonian Government\n* Estonian Parliament\n* Estonian political parties\n\n**External links**\n\n* Estonian Electoral Committee\n* Estonian Government\n* Estonian Parliament\n* Estonian political parties", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

In South Africa, testate succession is governed by the Wills Act 7 of 1953 and the Deeds Registries Act 47 of 1939.

During this period, the architectural styles of the English, Dutch, and other European settlers influenced the design of homes, resulting in unique and distinctive structures that reflected the cultural and economic diversity of the region. This article will explore the characteristics and evolution of these early houses, examining the materials, construction techniques, and regional variations that defined the First Period of Massachusetts architecture.\n\n**# Legend**\n\nThe following abbreviations will be used throughout this article to refer to architectural styles and regions:\n\n* E (English)\n* D (Dutch)\n* I (Indigenous)\n* G (Gabled)\n* S (Saltbox)\n* T (Timber-framed)\n* R (Raised foundation)\n* C (Central chimney)\n\n**# 1660–1670**\n\nDuring the early 1660s, the Massachusetts Bay Colony was experiencing rapid growth, driven by the influx of English settlers seeking economic opportunities. As a result, the demand for housing increased, leading to the construction of more homes. The 1660s saw the development of the following architectural features:\n\n* **Timber-framed construction**: The use of timber framing, where wooden posts and beams are used to construct the frame of the house, became a dominant feature of First Period houses. This technique allowed for the creation of large, open spaces and enabled the use of local materials.\n* **Gabled roofs**: Gabled roofs, characterized by a triangular shape, became a common feature of First Period houses. This design allowed for the use of space above the roof for storage or additional living quarters.\n* **Central chimneys**: The use of central chimneys, which served as both heating and cooking facilities, became a standard feature of First Period houses. This design allowed for improved ventilation and reduced the risk of fire.\n* **English influence**: The English settlers brought with them their architectural traditions, including the use of brick or stone for foundation walls and chimneys. This influence can be seen in the construction of homes such as the **Windsor Castle** (1662) in Windsor, Massachusetts.\n\n**# 1671–1679**\n\nThe late 1670s saw significant changes in the architectural styles and construction techniques used in Massachusetts. The following features emerged during this period:\n\n* **Saltbox design**: The saltbox design, characterized by a long, narrow back section that overhangs the front section, became a distinctive feature of First Period houses. This design allowed for additional storage space and improved the functionality of the house.\n* **Dutch influence**: The Dutch settlers, who arrived in the region during this period, brought with them their architectural traditions, including the use of gambrel roofs and ornate woodwork. This influence can be seen in the construction of homes such as the **Bartlett House** (1678) in Salem, Massachusetts.\n* **Regional variations**: The architectural styles and construction techniques used in different regions of Massachusetts began to take on distinct characteristics. For example, the **Cape Cod style**, characterized by a simple, rectangular design and a steeply pitched roof, emerged in the coastal regions of Massachusetts.\n\n**# See also**\n\n* **Architecture of the United States**\n* **First Period architecture**\n* **Massachusetts Bay Colony**\n* **English colonial architecture**\n\n**# Notes**\n\n* The dates provided for the construction of specific houses are approximate and based on available historical records.\n* The architectural styles and construction techniques described in this article are representative of the period, but may not be exhaustive.\n\n**# References**\n\n* (none)\n\n**# External links**\n\n* **National Register of Historic Places** (Massachusetts)\n* **Massachusetts Historical Society**\n* **American Institute of Architects** (AIA)", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

(formerly Facebook, Inc.). The app was launched on July 5, 2023, and is designed to provide a platform for users to share short-form text posts, similar to Twitter or Instagram, but with a focus on longer-form content. In this article, we will delve into the history of Threads, its features, user base, and responses to its launch.\n\n**History**\n\n### Predecessor\n\nBefore the launch of Threads, Meta Platforms, Inc. had been experimenting with various social media platforms, including Facebook and Instagram. However, the company had been facing increasing competition from other social media platforms, such as TikTok and Twitter, and was looking to expand its offerings.\n\n### Development and announcement\n\nIn 2022, Meta announced that it was developing a new social media app, codenamed \"P92\". The app was designed to provide a platform for users to share short-form text posts, similar to Twitter or Instagram, but with a focus on longer-form content. The app was developed in secret, with a team of developers working on the project for over a year.\n\n### Launch\n\nOn July 5, 2023, Meta announced the launch of Threads, a social networking app designed to provide a platform for users to share short-form text posts. The app was available for download on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store, and was initially only available in the United States.\n\n**Appearance and features**\n\n### Possibility of open interoperability\n\nOne of the unique features of Threads is its potential for open interoperability with other social media platforms. This means that users may be able to share content from Threads to other platforms, such as Facebook or Instagram, and vice versa. However, the extent to which this feature will be implemented is still unclear.\n\n### Account integration with Instagram\n\nThreads allows users to integrate their Instagram accounts with their Threads accounts. This means that users can share content from Instagram to Threads, and vice versa, and can also use their Instagram login credentials to access Threads.\n\n### Device compatibility\n\nThreads is available for download on both iOS and Android devices, and is compatible with a wide range of devices, including smartphones and tablets.\n\n### Censorship attempts\n\nIn the days following the launch of Threads, several users reported that their posts were being censored by the platform. Meta responded to these reports by stating that the platform was still in the process of developing its moderation policies and that some content may be removed temporarily while it is reviewed.\n\n### Advertising\n\nThreads allows users to view and interact with ads on the platform. However, the extent to which ads will be used on the platform is still unclear, and Meta has stated that it will prioritize user experience and engagement over advertising revenue.\n\n**Userbase**\n\n### Decline in the months after launch\n\nIn the months following the launch of Threads, the platform experienced a decline in user engagement and activity.

The trail spans approximately 150 kilometers and takes hikers through a diverse range of landscapes, including Mediterranean scrub, lagoons, and towering granite monoliths that give the path its name. This article provides an overview of the history, trekking routes, notable towers, flora and fauna, and other interesting aspects of the Path of 100 Towers.\n\n# History\n\nThe Path of 100 Towers has its roots in ancient times, when the region was inhabited by the Nuragic civilization. The Nuraghi, as they are known, built numerous fortified structures, including the iconic beehive-shaped towers that dot the landscape. The trail itself was likely used by ancient traders and travelers, who would have traversed the region to reach the nearby city of Tharros, an important Phoenician and Roman settlement.\n\nIn modern times, the Path of 100 Towers was established as a hiking trail in the 1980s, with the aim of promoting sustainable tourism and preserving the region's natural and cultural heritage. Today, the trail is maintained by local authorities and is an increasingly popular destination for outdoor enthusiasts, nature lovers, and culture vultures.\n\n# Trekking routes\n\nThe Path of 100 Towers can be hiked in its entirety, but it is also possible to tackle shorter sections of the trail. The trail is generally well-marked and easy to follow, with clear signage and regular checkpoints. The route is suitable for hikers of all levels, from beginners to experienced trekkers.\n\nThe trail can be divided into several sections, each with its own unique characteristics and attractions. The first section, which covers approximately 30 kilometers, takes hikers from the town of Sassari to the village of Castelsardo. This section passes through a mix of Mediterranean scrub and cultivated land, with occasional glimpses of the surrounding mountains.\n\nThe second section, which covers approximately 40 kilometers, takes hikers from Castelsardo to the village of Tergu. This section passes through a more rugged landscape, with frequent encounters with towering granite monoliths and dramatic views of the surrounding countryside.\n\nThe final section, which covers approximately 80 kilometers, takes hikers from Tergu to the town of Alghero. This section passes through a range of landscapes, including lagoons, beaches, and scrubland.\n\n# Towers\n\nThe Path of 100 Towers is, of course, famous for its numerous towers, which give the path its name. These structures are the remnants of the Nuragic civilization, which built them as fortified strongholds and temples.\n\n## Main towers\n\nSome of the most notable towers along the Path of 100 Towers include:\n\n* **Nuraghe di Palmadula**: This tower is located near the village of Palmadula and is one of the best-preserved Nuragic structures in the region.\n* **Nuraghe di Tuvixeddu**: This tower is located near the village of Castelsardo and is known for its distinctive shape and stunning views.\n* **Nuraghe di Serra**: This tower is located near the village of Serra and is one of the oldest Nuragic structures in the region.\n\n# Flora and Fauna\n\nThe Path of 100 Towers is home to a diverse range of flora and fauna, reflecting the region's Mediterranean climate and geography.\n\n## Mediterranean scrub\n\nThe scrublands along the Path of 100 Towers are dominated by species such as **juniper**, **arbutus**, and **myrtle**, which thrive in the dry, rocky conditions. These scrublands provide a haven for wildlife, including **birds of prey**, **hedgehogs**, and **scorpions**.\n\n## Lagoon\n\nThe Path of 100 Towers passes through several lagoons, including the Lago di Coghinas, which is an important habitat for **waterfowl**, **fish**, and **insects**. The lagoons are also home to **mudflats**, which provide a rich source of food for **birds** and **mammals**.\n\n# Books\n\nThere are several books available about the Path of 100 Towers, including:\n\n* **\"The Path of 100 Towers: A Hiker's Guide\"** by Luca Cortesi, which provides a comprehensive guide to the trail, including maps, photos, and practical information.\n* **\"Sardinia: A Guide\"** by Francesca Puglisi, which covers the island's history, culture, and natural attractions, including the Path of 100 Towers.\n* **\"The Nuragic Civilization: A History\"** by Maria Molinaro, which provides an in-depth look at the Nuragic civilization and its legacy in Sardinia.\n\n# Curiosities\n\nSome interesting facts about the Path of 100 Towers include:\n\n* **The longest tower**: The longest tower on the Path of 100 Towers is the Nuraghe di Tuvixeddu, which stands over 10 meters tall.\n* **The oldest tower**: The oldest tower on the Path of 100 Towers is the Nuraghe di Serra, which dates back to the 16th century BC.\n* **The most remote tower**: The most remote tower on the Path of 100 Towers is the Nuraghe di Palmadula, which is located near the village of Palmadula.\n\n# Similar treks\n\nIf you enjoy the Path of 100 Towers, you may also want to try other similar treks in Sardinia, including:\n\n* **The Gola di Gorropu**: A scenic hike through the Gola di Gorropu canyon, which is one of the deepest canyons in Europe.\n* **The Supramonte Trek**: A challenging hike through the Supramonte mountains, which offers stunning views of the surrounding countryside.\n* **The Costa Rei Trek**: A coastal hike along the Costa Rei, which offers breathtaking views of the Mediterranean Sea.\n\n# See also\n\n* **Sardinia**: For information about the island of Sardinia and its attractions.\n* **Nuragic civilization**: For information about the Nuragic civilization and its legacy in Sardinia.\n* **Mediterranean scrub**: For information about the Mediterranean scrub ecosystem and its characteristics.\n\n# Gallery\n\n[Insert images of the Path of 100 Towers, including towers, landscapes, and wildlife.]\n\n# References\n\n[Insert references and citations for the article.]\n\n# External links\n\n* **Official website**: For information about the Path of 100 Towers and its management.\n* **Sardinia tourism**: For information about tourism in Sardinia and its attractions.\n* **Nuragic civilization**: For information about the Nuragic civilization and its legacy in Sardinia.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

This phenomenon is primarily caused by human activities that release greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, into the atmosphere, leading to a trap of heat and a rise in global temperatures. The effects of climate change are widespread and varied, impacting different regions and communities in different ways. This article will provide an overview of the effects of climate change, including changes in temperature, weather, land, oceans, ice and snow, wildlife and nature, tipping points and irreversible impacts, health, food security and water security, human settlements, and economic impacts.\n\n**Changes in Temperature**\n\nOne of the most noticeable effects of climate change is the increase in average global temperatures. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the average global temperature has risen by about 1°C since the late 19th century. This rise in temperature has led to a range of consequences, including more frequent and intense heat waves, droughts, and storms.\n\n### **Heat Waves and Temperature Extremes**\n\nHeat waves are periods of abnormally hot weather that can last for several days or even weeks. They are becoming more frequent and severe due to climate change, with temperatures often reaching record highs. In 2019, a heat wave in Japan led to a record high temperature of 41.1°C, while in 2018, a heat wave in the United States led to a record high temperature of 49.6°C in Death Valley, California.\n\n### **Rain**\n\nWhile some areas are experiencing more frequent and intense heat waves, others are experiencing more frequent and intense rainfall. This is due to the warming of the planet, which is causing the atmosphere to hold more moisture. In some cases, this has led to severe flooding, particularly in urban areas that are not equipped to handle large amounts of rainfall.\n\n### **Extreme Storms**\n\nExtreme storms, including hurricanes, typhoons, and cyclones, are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change. These storms are fueled by warmer ocean temperatures, which provide more energy for the storm to grow.
