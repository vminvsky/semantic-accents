From its origins in ancient civilizations to its modern-day forms, rock climbing has evolved into a global sport with a massive following. This article explores the history of rock climbing, from its early beginnings to the present day.\n\n**Origins**\n\nThe earliest recorded evidence of rock climbing dates back to ancient Egypt, where climbers used ropes and ladders to ascend the steep walls of the Nile River. Similarly, in ancient Greece, climbers would scale the cliffs of Mount Olympus to reach the mythical home of the gods. In Asia, the art of rock climbing was practiced by Buddhist monks, who would climb the Himalayas as a form of spiritual discipline.\n\n**19th century**\n\nIn the 19th century, rock climbing became a popular activity among the upper classes in Europe. Climbers such as George Mallory and A.H. Bruce began to explore the mountains of the Alps and the British Isles, developing new techniques and equipment. The first recorded ascent of a major peak, the Matterhorn, was made by Edward Whymper and his team in 1865.\n\n**1900s**\n\nThe early 20th century saw the development of modern rock climbing as we know it today. The first climbing club, the Alpine Club, was founded in London in 1857, but it was not until the early 1900s that climbing became a popular sport. The first climbing guidebook, \"The Climbers' Guide to the Alps,\" was published in 1907, and the first climbing magazine, \"The Climber,\" was launched in 1909.\n\n**1910s**\n\nIn the 1910s, rock climbing began to take on a more adventurous and exploratory form. Climbers such as Walter Middlebrook and Ernest Carter began to explore the mountains of Africa and Asia, pushing the boundaries of what was thought possible. The first ascent of Mount Kenya, the highest peak in Africa, was made by Hans Meyer and Ludwig Purtscheller in 1899, but it was not until 1910 that the first ascent of Mount Kilimanjaro, the highest peak in Africa, was made by Hans Meyer and Ludwig Purtscheller.\n\n**1920s**\n\nIn the 1920s, rock climbing became more formalized, with the development of climbing clubs and the establishment of climbing competitions. The first climbing competition, the Alpine Club's annual climbing competition, was held in 1911, and the first international climbing competition, the Inter-Country Climbing Competition, was held in 1920. The 1920s also saw the development of new climbing techniques, such as free climbing and aid climbing.\n\n**1930s**\n\nThe 1930s were a significant period in the history of rock climbing, with the development of new climbing techniques and the establishment of climbing clubs and competitions. The first ascent of Mount Everest, the highest peak in the world, was made by Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay in 1953, but it was not until 1933 that the first ascent of the Eiger Nordwand, a difficult and notorious climb, was made by Anderl Heckmair and his team.\n\n**1940s**\n\nIn the 1940s, rock climbing became more accessible to the general public, with the development of new climbing equipment and the establishment of climbing clubs and competitions. The first climbing competition for women, the British Women's Climbing Competition, was held in 1946, and the first international climbing competition for women, the Inter-Country Climbing Competition for Women, was held in 1950.\n\n**1950s**\n\nThe 1950s were a significant period in the history of rock climbing, with the development of new climbing techniques and the establishment of climbing clubs and competitions. The first ascent of Mount Denali, the highest peak in North America, was made by Bradford Washburn and his team in 1951, and the first ascent of the Grand Teton, a difficult and notorious climb, was made by Bob and Ed Burgener in 1953.\n\n**1960s**\n\nThe 1960s saw the development of new climbing techniques, such as free climbing and aid climbing, and the establishment of climbing clubs and competitions. The first climbing competition for youth, the British Youth Climbing Competition, was held in 1964, and the first international climbing competition for youth, the Inter-Country Climbing Competition for Youth, was held in 1970.\n\n**1970s**\n\nThe 1970s were a significant period in the history of rock climbing, with the development of new climbing techniques and the establishment of climbing clubs and competitions. The first climbing competition for disabled climbers, the British Disabled Climbing Competition, was held in 1971, and the first international climbing competition for disabled climbers, the Inter-Country Climbing Competition for Disabled Climbers, was held in 1975.\n\n**1980s**\n\nThe 1980s saw the development of new climbing techniques, such as sport climbing and competition climbing, and the establishment of climbing clubs and competitions. The first climbing competition for indoor climbing, the British Indoor Climbing Competition, was held in 1985, and the first international climbing competition for indoor climbing, the Inter-Country Climbing Competition for Indoor Climbing, was held in 1990.\n\n**1990s**\n\nThe 1990s were a significant period in the history of rock climbing, with the development of new climbing techniques and the establishment of climbing clubs and competitions. The first climbing competition for ice climbing, the British Ice Climbing Competition, was held in 1992, and the first international climbing competition for ice climbing, the Inter-Country Climbing Competition for Ice Climbing, was held in 1995.\n\n**2000s**\n\nThe 2000s saw the development of new climbing techniques, such as bouldering and speed climbing, and the establishment of climbing clubs and competitions. The first climbing competition for bouldering, the British Bouldering Competition, was held in 2003, and the first international climbing competition for bouldering, the Inter-Country Climbing Competition for Bouldering, was held in 2005.\n\n**2010s**\n\nThe 2010s saw the development of new climbing techniques, such as competition climbing and indoor climbing, and the establishment of climbing clubs and competitions. The first climbing competition for competition climbing, the British Competition Climbing Competition, was held in 2012, and the first international climbing competition for competition climbing, the Inter-Country Climbing Competition for Competition Climbing, was held in 2015.\n\n**2020s**\n\nIn the 2020s, rock climbing continues to evolve and grow, with the development of new climbing techniques and the establishment of climbing clubs and competitions. The International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC) has become the governing body for sport climbing, and the first Olympic sport climbing competition was held in 2020.\n\n**See also**\n\n* List of notable rock climbers\n* List of climbing competitions\n* List of climbing clubs\n* List of climbing organizations\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is a general overview of the history of rock climbing and does not include every detail or event.\n* The history of rock climbing is complex and multifaceted, and this article is intended to provide a general understanding of the subject.\n* The terminology used in this article is based on the most commonly used terms in the climbing community.\n\n**References**\n\n* This article does not include any citations or references.\n\n**External links**\n\n* International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC)\n* Union of European Alpine Clubs (UEAC)\n* American Alpine Club (AAC)\n* Alpine Club (UK)\n* Climbing.com\n* Rockandice.com", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The film stars R. Madhavan and Vijay Sethupathi in the lead roles. The movie follows the story of a police officer, Vikram (played by R. Madhavan), who is tasked with capturing a notorious gangster, Vedha (played by Vijay Sethupathi).\n\nPlot\n\nThe film begins with an introduction to Vikram, a dedicated police officer who is determined to rid the city of crime. Vikram is a law-abiding citizen who follows the rules and regulations. Vedha, on the other hand, is a ruthless gangster who has no qualms about killing anyone who gets in his way. The two men have a history, with Vedha having killed Vikram's wife and daughter.\n\nAs Vikram is tasked with capturing Vedha, he decides to use unconventional means to bring him down. He meets with Vedha and tells him that he is willing to let him go if he can justify the killing of his family. Vedha, who has a philosophical approach to life, agrees to tell Vikram a story that will justify his actions.\n\nThe film then cuts to a series of flashbacks, where Vedha recounts the story of a farmer who kills his son for the greater good. The farmer's actions are justified by Vedha, who argues that the ends justify the means. Vikram is torn between his duty as a police officer and his desire for revenge.\n\nAs the story unfolds, Vikram and Vedha engage in a cat-and-mouse game, with each trying to outsmart the other. The film takes a dark and twisted turn, with Vikram's obsession with revenge consuming him. In the end, Vikram is forced to confront the reality of his actions and the true nature of justice.\n\nCast\n\nThe film features a talented cast, including:\n\n* R. Madhavan as Vikram\n* Vijay Sethupathi as Vedha\n* Shraddha Srinath as Priya\n* Kathir as Veera\n* Payal Rajput as Preethi\n* Varalaxmi Sarathkumar as Priya's sister\n\nProduction\n\n### Development\n\nVikram Vedha was first announced in 2017, with Pushkar and Gayathri set to direct the film. The screenplay was written by the duo, who drew inspiration from the 2011 Malayalam film of the same name. The film was initially set to star R. Madhavan and Vijay Sethupathi, with the duo's on-screen chemistry being a major draw for the project.\n\n### Casting\n\nThe casting process for Vikram Vedha was a lengthy one, with Pushkar and Gayathri taking their time to find the perfect actors for the roles. R.

The art of pottery dates back thousands of years and has been a vital part of human culture, playing a significant role in the development of civilizations and societies.\n\n**Main types**\n\nPottery can be broadly classified into three main types: earthenware, stoneware, and porcelain. Each type has distinct characteristics and is used for specific purposes.\n\n### **Earthenware**\n\nEarthenware is a type of pottery that is made from a type of clay that is often mixed with other materials, such as sand and straw. It is fired at a relatively low temperature, typically between 1000°C to 1200°C. Earthenware is frequently used for functional items, such as plates, bowls, and cups, as well as for decorative pieces.\n\nEarthenware is known for its porous and breathable nature, which allows it to absorb and release moisture easily. This makes it a popular choice for items that need to be lightweight and easy to clean. However, earthenware is also more prone to cracking and breaking than other types of pottery.\n\n### **Stoneware**\n\nStoneware is a type of pottery that is made from a type of clay that is denser and more durable than earthenware. It is fired at a higher temperature, typically between 1200°C to 1400°C. Stoneware is known for its strength, durability, and resistance to moisture.\n\nStoneware is frequently used for functional items, such as cups, bowls, and plates, as well as for decorative pieces. It is also used for items that require a high level of strength and durability, such as tableware and cookware.\n\n### **Porcelain**\n\nPorcelain is a type of pottery that is made from a type of clay that is extremely fine and pure. It is fired at a very high temperature, typically between 1250°C to 1400°C. Porcelain is known for its whiteness, translucency, and strength.\n\nPorcelain is frequently used for decorative pieces, such as vases, figurines, and tableware. It is also used for functional items, such as cups, bowls, and plates, that require a high level of strength and durability.\n\n**Archaeology**\n\nArchaeology is the study of the past through the examination of artifacts, including pottery. Pottery is a valuable source of information for archaeologists, as it can provide clues about the culture, technology, and ways of life of ancient civilizations.\n\n### **Fabric analysis**\n\nFabric analysis is the process of examining the physical properties of pottery to determine its composition, age, and origin. This can include examining the texture, color, and weight of the pottery, as well as analyzing its chemical and mineral composition.\n\n**Clay bodies and raw materials**\n\nClay bodies and raw materials are the starting point for making pottery. Clay is a type of fine-grained earth material that is often mixed with other materials, such as sand and straw, to create a workable mixture.\n\nClay bodies can be classified into several types, including:\n\n* **Earthenware clay**: a type of clay that is often mixed with other materials, such as sand and straw.\n* **Stoneware clay**: a type of clay that is denser and more durable than earthenware clay.\n* **Porcelain clay**: a type of clay that is extremely fine and pure.\n\nRaw materials can also be classified into several types, including:\n\n* **Kaolin**: a type of clay that is often used in porcelain production.\n* **Feldspar**: a type of mineral that is often used in ceramic production.\n* **Quartz**: a type of mineral that is often used in ceramic production.\n\n**Production**\n\nPottery production involves several stages, including shaping, drying, firing, and decorating.\n\n### **Shaping**\n\nShaping is the process of creating the desired shape and form of the pottery. This can be done by hand or using a machine.\n\nThere are several types of shaping techniques, including:\n\n* **Hand-building**: the process of shaping pottery by hand using techniques such as coiling, pinching, and throwing.\n* **Throwing**: the process of shaping pottery using a potter's wheel.\n* **Slip-casting**: the process of shaping pottery using a mold and a liquid clay mixture.\n\n### **Drying**\n\nDrying is the process of removing excess moisture from the pottery. This can be done by air drying or using a drying oven.\n\n### **Firing**\n\nFiring is the process of heating the pottery to a high temperature to achieve the desired properties. This can be done in a kiln or a furnace.\n\n#### **Temperature**\n\nThe temperature of the firing process can vary depending on the type of pottery being produced. For example:\n\n* **Low-fire** pottery is fired at a temperature of around 1000°C.\n* **High-fire** pottery is fired at a temperature of around 1400°C.\n\n#### **Atmosphere**\n\nThe atmosphere of the firing process can also affect the properties of the pottery. For example:\n\n* **Reducing atmosphere**: a type of atmosphere that is low in oxygen and high in carbon monoxide.\n* **Oxidizing atmosphere**: a type of atmosphere that is high in oxygen and low in carbon monoxide.\n\n#### **Methods**\n\nThere are several methods of firing pottery, including:\n\n* **Electric kiln**: a type of kiln that uses electricity to heat the pottery.\n* **Gas kiln**: a type of kiln that uses gas to heat the pottery.\n* **Wood-fired kiln**: a type of kiln that uses wood to heat the pottery.\n\n#### **Stages**\n\nThe firing process can be divided into several stages, including:\n\n* **Bisque firing**: the first stage of firing, where the pottery is fired at a low temperature to remove excess moisture.\n* **Glost firing**: the second stage of firing, where the pottery is fired at a higher temperature to achieve the desired glaze.\n\n### **Decorating**\n\nDecorating is the process of adding color, texture, and pattern to the pottery. This can be done using a variety of techniques, including:\n\n* **Glazing**: the process of applying a layer of glaze to the pottery.\n* **Slip-trailing**: the process of applying a liquid clay mixture to the pottery to create a design.\n* **Underglaze painting**: the process of painting a design onto the pottery using a liquid clay mixture.\n\n### **Methods**\n\nThere are several methods of decorating pottery, including:\n\n* **Hand-painting**: the process of painting a design onto the pottery by hand.\n* **Machine-printing**: the process of printing a design onto the pottery using a machine.\n* **Transfer printing**: the process of transferring a design onto the pottery using a transfer paper.\n\n**Glazing**\n\nGlazing is the process of applying a layer of glaze to the pottery. This can be done using a variety of techniques, including:\n\n* **Dipping**: the process of dipping the pottery into a glaze.\n* **Spraying**: the process of spraying the pottery with a glaze.\n* **Brushing**: the process of brushing a glaze onto the pottery.\n\n**Health and environmental issues**\n\nPottery production can have health and environmental impacts, including:\n\n* **Dust**: the process of creating and handling clay can release dust into the air, which can be a health hazard.\n* **Chemicals**: the use of chemicals in the glazing process can release toxic fumes and harm the environment.\n* **Energy**: the process of firing pottery can be energy-intensive and contribute to greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n**History**\n\nThe history of pottery dates back thousands of years and spans across the globe.\n\n### **Early pottery**\n\nThe earliest evidence of pottery dates back to around 9000 BC, in the Fertile Crescent region of the Middle East.\n\n### **History by region**\n\nPottery has been produced in various regions of the world, including:\n\n* **East Asia**: the earliest evidence of pottery in East Asia dates back to around 18,000 BC, in China.\n* **South Asia**: the earliest evidence of pottery in South Asia dates back to around 10,000 BC, in India.\n* **Southeast Asia**: the earliest evidence of pottery in Southeast Asia dates back to around 10,000 BC, in Thailand.\n* **West Asia**: the earliest evidence of pottery in West Asia dates back to around 9000 BC, in the Fertile Crescent region.\n* **Europe**: the earliest evidence of pottery in Europe dates back to around 6000 BC, in the Balkans.\n* **United Kingdom**: the earliest evidence of pottery in the United Kingdom dates back to around 4000 BC, in the Neolithic period.\n* **Arabic pottery**: the earliest evidence of Arabic pottery dates back to around 600 AD, in the Middle East.\n* **Americas**: the earliest evidence of pottery in the Americas dates back to around 3000 BC, in Mexico.\n* **Africa**: the earliest evidence of pottery in Africa dates back to around 2000 BC, in Egypt.\n* **Oceania**: the earliest evidence of pottery in Oceania dates back to around 1000 BC, in Papua New Guinea.\n\n**See also**\n\n* **Ceramics**\n* **Glass**\n* **Metalsmithing**\n* **Weaving**\n* **Textiles**\n\n**References**\n\n* **Bibliography**: a list of sources used in the creation of this article.\n* **Online resources**: a list of online resources used in the creation of this article.\n\n**Further reading**\n\n* **Books**: a list of books related to pottery and ceramics.\n* **Articles**: a list of articles related to pottery and ceramics.\n* **Websites**: a list of websites related to pottery and ceramics.\n\n**External links**\n\n* **Pottery websites**: a list of websites related to pottery and ceramics.\n* **Pottery communities**: a list of online communities related to pottery and ceramics.\n* **Pottery courses**: a list of online courses and tutorials related to pottery and ceramics.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

Heard\n\nThe Depp v. Heard case refers to a highly publicized defamation lawsuit filed by American actor Johnny Depp against his former wife, actress Amber Heard, in 2019. The lawsuit stemmed from an op-ed article written by Heard for The Washington Post, in which she described herself as a survivor of domestic abuse. Depp claimed that the article implied he was a domestic abuser, despite him not being named in the article.\n\nBackground\n\n### Depp and Heard's relationship\n\nJohnny Depp and Amber Heard met on the set of the 2011 film \"The Rum Diary,\" in which they both starred. They began dating in 2012 and got married in 2015. However, their marriage was short-lived, and they separated in 2016. The couple's divorce was finalized in 2017.\n\n### Depp v News Group Newspapers Ltd\n\nDepp had previously sued News Group Newspapers Ltd, the publisher of The Sun, over an article that called him a \"wife beater.\" The lawsuit was settled out of court in 2018, with Depp agreeing to pay the newspaper's costs.\n\n### Heard's op-ed in The Washington Post\n\nIn December 2018, Heard wrote an op-ed article for The Washington Post titled \"I spoke up against sexual violence – and faced our culture's wrath. That has to change.\" In the article, she described herself as a survivor of domestic abuse, but did not mention Depp by name. However, Depp's lawyers claimed that the article implied he was the abuser.\n\n### Waldman's comments in the Daily Mail\n\nIn an interview with The Daily Mail, Heard's lawyer, Eric George, stated that Depp's lawsuit was an attempt to silence Heard and other domestic abuse survivors. However, Depp's lawyer, Adam Waldman, responded by calling Heard's op-ed article \"a clear case of defamation\" and stating that Depp had \"never been charged with any crime\" related to domestic violence.\n\nCivil action\n\n### Pre-trial developments\n\nThe lawsuit was filed in Virginia in 2019 and was initially scheduled to go to trial in March 2020. However, the trial was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the meantime, Depp's lawyers filed several motions to dismiss the case, but the judge denied them.\n\n### Trial\n\nThe trial finally began in April 2022, with Depp's lawyers presenting their case first. They called several witnesses, including former employees of Depp's who testified that they had never seen him physically abuse Heard. Depp himself also took the stand and denied ever hitting Heard.\n\n#### Opening statements\n\nDepp's lawyer, Adam Waldman, delivered the opening statement for the defense, saying that Heard's op-ed article was \"a clear case of defamation\" and that Depp had \"never been charged with any crime\" related to domestic violence.

The election was part of the 2022 United States elections.\n\nBackground\n------------\n\nThe Texas House of Representatives is the lower house of the Texas Legislature, with 150 members representing districts across the state. The election was held to fill all 150 seats in the House, with members serving two-year terms.\n\nRedistricting\n-------------\n\nPrior to the election, the Texas Legislature underwent a redistricting process to redraw the boundaries of the House districts. The process involved the creation of new districts, the elimination of existing districts, and the adjustment of district boundaries to reflect changes in population.\n\n### Seats without incumbents\n\nA total of 29 House districts were up for election without incumbents. These districts included seats that were newly created by the redistricting process, as well as seats that were previously held by incumbents who chose not to seek re-election.\n\n### Double-bunked incumbents\n\nIn some cases, multiple incumbents were paired in the same district due to the redistricting process. This meant that voters in these districts would be choosing between two or more incumbents.\n\nRetirements\n------------\n\nA total of 44 incumbents chose not to seek re-election, including some who had been in office for decades. This created opportunities for new candidates to run for office and potentially shake up the political landscape in Texas.\n\nSpecial elections\n-----------------\n\nIn addition to the regular election, several special elections were held to fill vacancies in the House. These elections were held to fill seats that became vacant due to the death or resignation of an incumbent.\n\nIncumbents defeated\n------------------\n\nA total of 11 incumbents were defeated in the election, including some who had been in office for many years. This marked a significant shift in the composition of the House and created new opportunities for new leaders to emerge.\n\n### Democrats\n\nA total of 7 Democratic incumbents were defeated in the election, including:\n\n* District 21: Rep. Treviño lost to Republican challenger, Mayes Middleton\n* District 34: Rep. Abel Herrero lost to Republican challenger, Elianor Figueroa\n* District 36: Rep. Josey Garcia lost to Republican challenger, Alex Dominguez\n* District 37: Rep. Jon Rosenthal lost to Republican challenger, Justin Holland\n* District 42: Rep. Gina Hinojosa lost to Republican challenger, Ben Curtis\n* District 63: Rep. Alex Dominguez lost to Republican challenger, Alex Garza\n* District 65: Rep. Trey Martinez Fischer lost to Republican challenger, William Hayward\n\n### Republicans\n\nA total of 4 Republican incumbents were defeated in the election, including:\n\n* District 22: Rep. Rick Miller lost to Democratic challenger, Gina Hinojosa\n* District 38: Rep. Steve Toth lost to Democratic challenger, Stephen Vinton\n* District 57: Rep. Will Metcalf lost to Democratic challenger, Gayle Keating\n* District 87: Rep. Craig Goldman lost to Democratic challenger, Richard Young\n\nPredictions\n------------\n\nPrior to the election, several analysts predicted that the Republicans would retain control of the House, but with a reduced majority. This prediction was based on a combination of factors, including the redistricting process, the performance of Republican incumbents in previous elections, and the strength of the Democratic ticket.\n\n### Statewide\n\nThe Republicans retained control of the House, but with a reduced majority. They won 83 seats to the Democrats' 67.\n\n### Competitive districts\n\nA total of 30 districts were considered competitive, with both parties having a strong chance of winning. These districts included seats that were newly created by the redistricting process, as well as seats that were previously held by incumbents who chose not to seek re-election.\n\nSummary of results\n-------------------\n\nThe Republicans retained control of the House, but with a reduced majority. They won 83 seats to the Democrats' 67.\n\n### Statewide\n\nThe Republicans won 83 seats to the Democrats' 67.\n\n### Close races\n\nA total of 20 districts were decided by a margin of less than 10 percentage points, with several districts being decided by a margin of less than 5 percentage points.\n\nResults by district\n-------------------\n\nHere are the results by district:\n\n### District

The club was founded in 1966 and has a rich history in Cypriot and European basketball.\n\n#History\n\n##Founding, early years & First Golden Age (1966–1988)\n\nAEL Limassol B.C. was founded in 1966 by a group of basketball enthusiasts in Limassol, Cyprus. The club's early years were marked by modest success, with the team competing in the Cyprus Basketball Division A. In the late 1970s, AEL Limassol began to experience its first period of success, winning several regional titles and earning a reputation as one of the top teams in Cyprus.\n\nThe team's first golden age began in the early 1980s, when AEL Limassol started to attract top talent from Cyprus and abroad. This period saw the team win several national championships, including the Cypriot Basketball Championship in 1983 and 1984. AEL Limassol also began to make a name for itself in European competitions, competing in the FIBA European Champions Cup and the FIBA European Cup.\n\n##Decline, relegation & return to glory (1989–2001)\n\nIn the late 1980s, AEL Limassol began to experience a decline in fortunes, struggling to maintain its position in the top division of Cypriot basketball. The team was relegated to the second division in 1991, where it spent several seasons before returning to the top division in 1998.\n\nThe team's return to the top division marked the beginning of a new period of success for AEL Limassol. The team won several regional titles, including the Cypriot Basketball Championship in 2000 and 2001. AEL Limassol also began to make a name for itself in European competitions, competing in the FIBA Saporta Cup and the FIBA Korać Cup.\n\n##Second Golden Age & various European successes (2002–2010)\n\nThe early 2000s saw the beginning of AEL Limassol's second golden age. The team won several national championships, including the Cypriot Basketball Championship in 2003, 2004, and 2005. AEL Limassol also began to experience significant success in European competitions, competing in the FIBA EuroLeague and the FIBA EuroCup.\n\n###The initial Dragan Raca era (2002–2005)\n\nIn 2002, AEL Limassol hired Serbian coach Dragan Raca, who would go on to lead the team to several national and European titles. Under Raca's guidance, AEL Limassol won the Cypriot Basketball Championship in 2003, 2004, and 2005. The team also reached the semifinals of the FIBA EuroCup in 2005, finishing fourth in the competition.\n\n###Organising the FIBA EuroCup All-Star Day Limassol & interest to join Greek A1 Basketball League (2006–2008)\n\nIn 2006, AEL Limassol organized the FIBA EuroCup All-Star Day Limassol, which brought together some of the top players in European basketball. The event was a huge success, attracting a large crowd and generating significant attention for the club.\n\nDuring this period, AEL Limassol also expressed interest in joining the Greek A1 Basketball League. The team's owners believed that competing in the Greek league would provide a new challenge and help to improve the team's profile in European basketball.\n\n###Transformation from EuroChallenge contenders to EuroChallenge favourites (2008–2010)\n\nIn 2008, AEL Limassol began to experience a significant transformation, shifting from a EuroChallenge contender to a EuroChallenge favourite. The team won the Cypriot Basketball Championship in 2009 and 2010, and reached the semifinals of the FIBA EuroChallenge in 2009.\n\n##Descent into obscurity, dissolution & reformation (2011–2017)\n\nIn the early 2010s, AEL Limassol began to experience a decline in fortunes, struggling to maintain its position in the top division of Cypriot basketball. The team was relegated to the second division in 2012, where it spent several seasons before returning to the top division in 2016.\n\nIn 2017, AEL Limassol underwent a major reformation, with the club's owners and management team working to rebuild the team and restore its reputation in Cypriot and European basketball.\n\n##Recent history (2018–present)\n\n###Return to Division A & reaching two Cup finals (2018–2022)\n\nIn 2018, AEL Limassol returned to the top division of Cypriot basketball, competing in Division A. The team reached the finals of the Cypriot Basketball Cup in 2019 and 2020, finishing as runner-up in both competitions.\n\n###Gradual improvements & participation in the Balkan League (2023–)\n\nIn 2023, AEL Limassol began to experience gradual improvements, winning several regional titles and competing in the Balkan League. The team has expressed interest in returning to European competitions, with a view to competing in the FIBA EuroLeague or the FIBA EuroCup in the near future.\n\n#Stadium\n\nAEL Limassol B.C. plays its home games at the Ammochostos Indoor Hall, a 4,000-seat indoor arena located in Limassol, Cyprus. The arena is one of the largest in Cyprus and provides a state-of-the-art facility for the team to compete in.\n\n#Supporters & rivalries\n\nAEL Limassol B.C. has a strong following in Limassol and across Cyprus, with the team's supporters known for their passion and dedication. The team's main rivals are Apollon Limassol B.C. and Enosis Neon Paralimniou B.C., with whom they contest the Cypriot Basketball Championship.\n\n#Colours & crest history\n\nAEL Limassol B.C.'s colours are red, white, and blue, and the team's crest features a lion, which is the club's mascot. The team's current crest was introduced in 2018, following the club's reformation.\n\n#Mascot\n\n##Leontas (\"Lion\")\n\nAEL Limassol B.C.'s mascot is Leontas, a lion who has been a part of the team's branding since the early 2000s.

It was a complex and multifaceted conflict, involving a combination of social, economic, and political factors. The rebellion was characterized by a series of protests, skirmishes, and ultimately, a fierce battle between gold miners and the colonial authorities.\n\n**Origins in the Victorian gold rush**\n\nThe Victorian gold rush began in 1851, with the discovery of gold at Ballarat, a small town in western Victoria. The gold rush attracted thousands of prospectors and miners from all over the world, including Australia, Europe, and North America. The influx of people put a strain on the local infrastructure, and the government was forced to impose taxes on the miners to finance the construction of roads, bridges, and other public works.\n\n**Protests on the goldfields: 1851–1854**\n\nThe first protests on the goldfields began in 1851, as miners responded to the imposition of taxes and the lack of security on the goldfields. The protests were largely peaceful, but they laid the groundwork for the more violent confrontations that would follow.\n\n#### La Trobe introduces monthly mining tax as protests begin\n\nIn 1851, the Governor of Victoria, Sir Charles La Trobe, introduced a monthly mining tax of 30 shillings per month, which was payable by all miners. The tax was highly unpopular, and it sparked a series of protests and demonstrations on the goldfields.\n\n#### First gold commissioner arrives in Ballarat\n\nIn 1853, the first gold commissioner, Henry H. Lonsdale, arrived in Ballarat. Lonsdale was a senior police officer, and his arrival marked the beginning of a more formalized system of government on the goldfields.\n\n#### Bendigo Petition and the Red Ribbon Movement\n\nIn 1853, a petition was circulated in Bendigo, a town in central Victoria, calling for the abolition of the mining tax. The petition was successful, and it marked the beginning of the Red Ribbon Movement, a campaign to reform the government's policies on the goldfields.\n\n#### Legislative Council calls for Commission of Inquiry\n\nIn 1853, the Legislative Council, the upper house of the Victorian parliament, passed a motion calling for a Commission of Inquiry into the treatment of miners on the goldfields. The inquiry was established, and it reported in 1854, recommending significant reforms to the government's policies on the goldfields.\n\n#### Hotham replaces La Trobe\n\nIn 1854, La Trobe was replaced as Governor of Victoria by Sir Charles Hotham. Hotham was a more conservative governor, and his appointment marked a shift in the government's policies on the goldfields.\n\n**Tensions escalate**\n\nThe tensions between the miners and the government continued to escalate throughout 1854. The miners were dissatisfied with the government's policies, and they began to organize themselves into a more formalized movement.\n\n#### Murder of James Scobie and the burning of the Eureka hotel\n\nIn December 1854, a miner named James Scobie was murdered in a dispute over a gold claim. The murder sparked a wave of violence on the goldfields, and the Eureka Hotel was burned to the ground.\n\n#### Ballarat Reform League meetings\n\nIn the months leading up to the rebellion, the Ballarat Reform League, a group of miners who were determined to reform the government's policies on the goldfields, held a series of meetings and rallies. The meetings were well-attended, and they helped to galvanize the miners and build support for the rebellion.\n\n#### Escalating violence as military convoy looted\n\nIn January 1855, a military convoy was sent to the goldfields to quell the violence. However, the convoy was looted by a group of miners, and the soldiers were forced to retreat.\n\n**Open rebellion**\n\nThe open rebellion began on December 3, 1854, when a group of miners, led by Peter Lalor, a young Irishman who had arrived in Australia in 1853, occupied a stockade on the Eureka lead. The stockade was a fortified position, and it marked the beginning of the Eureka Rebellion.\n\n#### Paramilitary mobilisation and swearing allegiance to the Southern Cross\n\nThe paramilitary mobilisation was a key feature of the rebellion. The miners were organized into a series of groups, each with its own leader, and they were equipped with a range of arms, including rifles, pistols, and swords. The miners swore allegiance to the Southern Cross, a symbol of their rebellion against the government.\n\n#### Fortification of the Eureka lead\n\nThe Eureka lead was a narrow ridge that ran through the heart of the goldfields. The miners fortified the lead, building a series of defensive positions and stockades to protect themselves from the government's forces.\n\n#### Vinegar Hill blunder: Irish dimension factors in dwindling numbers at stockade\n\nThe Vinegar Hill blunder was a key tactical error made by the miners. The blunder involved a group of Irish miners leaving the stockade to attack a group of government soldiers. The attack was unsuccessful, and the soldiers were able to regroup and launch a counterattack. The blunder marked a turning point in the rebellion, and it helped to weaken the miners' position.\n\n#### Departing detachment of Independent Californian Rangers leaves small garrison behind\n\nIn the months leading up to the rebellion, a detachment of Independent Californian Rangers arrived in Australia. The Rangers were a group of American soldiers who were hired by the government to quell the rebellion. The detachment left a small garrison behind, which was tasked with holding the Eureka lead.\n\n**Battle of the Eureka Stockade**\n\nThe Battle of the Eureka Stockade was a fierce and bloody conflict that took place on December 3, 1854. The battle was sparked by a group of government soldiers who were tasked with disarming the miners and arresting their leaders. The miners put up a fierce resistance, and the battle raged on for several hours. In the end, the government's forces emerged victorious, and the stockade was overrun.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe aftermath of the rebellion was marked by a series of trials and executions. The government's forces arrested and charged a group of miners with sedition and high treason. The trials were widely criticized, and they helped to galvanize public opinion against the government.\n\n#### Trials for sedition and high treason\n\nThe trials for sedition and high treason were a key feature of the aftermath of the rebellion. The government's forces arrested and charged a group of miners with treason, and the trials were widely criticized.\n\n#### Commission of Inquiry report\n\nIn 1855, a Commission of Inquiry was established to investigate the rebellion. The commission reported on the causes and consequences of the rebellion, and it made a number of recommendations for reform.\n\n#### Peter Lalor enters parliament\n\nIn 1856, Peter Lalor, one of the leaders of the rebellion, was elected to the Victorian parliament. Lalor's election marked a significant shift in the politics of the goldfields, and it helped to pave the way for the development of a more democratic and representative government.\n\n**Location of Bakery Hill and the Eureka Stockade**\n\nBakery Hill is a small hill located in the heart of the goldfields. The Eureka Stockade was built on the hill, and it was the site of the Battle of the Eureka Stockade.\n\n**Political legacy**\n\nThe Eureka Rebellion had a significant impact on the politics of the goldfields and the wider Australian community. The rebellion helped to galvanize public opinion against the government, and it paved the way for the development of a more democratic and representative government.\n\n**Commemoration**\n\nThe Eureka Rebellion has been commemorated in a number of ways over the years. The Eureka Flag, a symbol of the rebellion, has been displayed at a number of events and exhibitions. The Eureka Stockade has been rebuilt and is now a popular tourist destination.\n\n#### 19th century\n\nIn the 19th century, the Eureka Rebellion was remembered as a symbol of resistance against tyranny and oppression. The rebellion was celebrated in a number of songs and poems, and it was seen as a key moment in the development of Australian democracy.\n\n#### 20th century\n\nIn the 20th century, the Eureka Rebellion was commemorated in a number of ways. The Eureka Flag was displayed at a number of events and exhibitions, and the Eureka Stockade was rebuilt and restored.\n\n#### 21st century\n\nIn the 21st century, the Eureka Rebellion has been commemorated in a number of ways. The Eureka Flag has been displayed at a number of events and exhibitions, and the Eureka Stockade has been restored and preserved.\n\n**Popular culture**\n\nThe Eureka Rebellion has been featured in a number of songs, poems, and works of fiction over the years. The rebellion has been celebrated in a number of songs, including the famous Eureka song, which was written by a group of miners in the 1850s.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Eureka Stockade\n* Eureka Flag\n* Peter Lalor\n* Ballarat Reform League\n* James Scobie\n* Vinegar Hill\n* Independent Californian Rangers\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The Eureka Rebellion was a pivotal event in Australian history, taking place in 1854, during the Victorian gold rush.\n* The rebellion was characterized by a series of protests, skirmishes, and ultimately, a fierce battle between gold miners and the colonial authorities.\n* The Eureka Rebellion had a significant impact on the politics of the goldfields and the wider Australian community.\n\n**References**\n\n* Nieuwenhuizen, J.

Born on January 23, 1991, in Russia, Sorokin moved to the United States with her family at a young age. Her early life and experiences would shape her into the cunning and manipulative individual she became.\n\n## Early Life\n\nSorokin's family moved to Germany and then to the United States, where she grew up in Queens, New York. Her parents, Dmitry and Ljubov Sorokin, were both Soviet-era immigrants who struggled to make a living in the United States. Despite their financial difficulties, they instilled in Sorokin a sense of luxury and high-end living, often taking her to upscale restaurants and hotels.\n\nSorokin's parents encouraged her to pursue a career in finance, and she studied at the German International School in New York City. However, she dropped out of college and began working as a waitress and a hostess to make ends meet. Her early experiences in the service industry would later influence her ability to blend in with wealthy socialites and create elaborate personas.\n\n## Fraud\n\nSorokin's descent into a life of deception began in her early 20s. She created the alias \"Anna Delvey,\" a name that would become synonymous with luxury and sophistication. Using her fake identity, she began to make connections in the New York City social scene, befriending wealthy individuals and influential people in the fashion and art worlds.\n\nSorokin's schemes involved posing as a wealthy heiress, claiming to have a trust fund and a lavish lifestyle. She would use this persona to manipulate others into financing her lavish spending habits, staying in luxury hotels, and eating at high-end restaurants. Her victims included a Manhattan hotel concierge, a billionaire's son, and a wealthy socialite.\n\nOne of Sorokin's most brazen schemes involved convincing a hotel concierge to upgrade her to a suite and pay for her stay, even though she had no intention of paying for it. When the concierge asked for payment, Sorokin claimed that she had forgotten her credit card and needed to return to her apartment to retrieve it. When she failed to return, the concierge was left with a large bill and no payment.\n\n## Indictment and Arrest\n\nSorokin's antics eventually caught up with her, and she was indicted on multiple charges of grand larceny and theft of services. In October 2017, she was arrested and charged with multiple counts of grand larceny, theft of services, and attempted grand larceny. Her arrest marked the beginning of the end of her elaborate scheme.\n\n## Trial, Conviction, and Sentence\n\nSorokin's trial began in February 2019, and she was found guilty of multiple counts of grand larceny and theft of services. The trial was highly publicized, with many of her victims taking the stand to testify against her. In April 2019, Sorokin was sentenced to four to 12 years in prison.\n\n## ICE Custody\n\nIn 2020, Sorokin was transferred to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody, where she was held as a \"priority for removal\" due to her visa being revoked. Her time in ICE custody was marked by reports of poor living conditions and inadequate medical care.\n\n## Media Representation\n\nSorokin's story has been the subject of numerous media outlets, including The New York Times, CNN, and Forbes. Her story has also been adapted into a Netflix series, \"Inventing Anna,\" which premiered in February 2022.\n\n## After Prison\n\nSorokin was released from prison in 2021 and has since spoken publicly about her experiences. In an interview with The New York Times, she expressed regret for her actions and acknowledged the harm she caused to her victims.\n\n### Art Shows\n\nIn 2022, Sorokin's art was featured in a show at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles. The show, titled \"Anna's World,\" featured a collection of Sorokin's paintings and sculptures.\n\n### Non-Fungible Tokens\n\nSorokin has also ventured into the world of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), creating her own digital art and selling it online. Her NFTs have been met with mixed reviews, with some critics praising her creativity and others criticizing her lack of technical skill.\n\n### Fashion\n\nSorokin has also made a name for herself in the fashion world, launching her own clothing line and collaborating with high-end designers. Her fashion brand has been met with both praise and criticism, with some critics accusing her of cultural appropriation and others praising her unique style.\n\n## Personal Life\n\nSorokin's personal life has been the subject of much speculation, with many wondering about her relationships and motivations. In an interview with The New York Times, she revealed that she had been in a romantic relationship with a woman, but declined to provide further details.\n\n## See Also\n\n* Inventing Anna (TV series)\n* Anna Delvey (Netflix series)\n* The New York Times\n* CNN\n* Forbes\n\n## External Links\n\n* Anna Sorokin's official website\n* Inventing Anna (TV series) on Netflix\n* Anna Delvey (Netflix series) on Netflix\n* The New York Times article on Anna Sorokin", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

This can occur due to various reasons, including ischemia, anemia, histotoxic hypoxia, and other conditions. Hypoxia can affect different parts of the body, leading to a range of signs and symptoms, from mild to severe.\n\nClassification\n\n### By cause\n\nHypoxia can be classified based on its cause into several categories.\n\n#### Ischemia\n\nIschemia is a condition where the blood flow to a particular region of the body is restricted, leading to a decrease in oxygen supply. This can occur due to various reasons, such as atherosclerosis, cardiac arrest, or shock.\n\n#### Hypoxemic hypoxia\n\nHypoxemic hypoxia occurs when the blood's oxygen-carrying capacity is reduced, leading to a decrease in oxygen supply to the body's tissues. This can occur due to various reasons, including carbon monoxide poisoning, altitude, hypoxic breathing gases, and other conditions.\n\n##### Carbon monoxide poisoning\n\nCarbon monoxide poisoning occurs when carbon monoxide binds to hemoglobin in the blood, reducing its oxygen-carrying capacity. This can occur due to exposure to carbon monoxide from combustion sources, such as fires or faulty gas appliances.\n\n##### Altitude\n\nAltitude-induced hypoxia occurs when the body is exposed to high altitudes, where the air pressure is lower and the oxygen levels are lower. This can occur in individuals who ascend to high altitudes without acclimatization.\n\n##### Hypoxic breathing gases\n\nHypoxic breathing gases are gases that have a lower oxygen content than air. This can occur in individuals who breathe in gases that are not adequately oxygenated, such as those in a diving helmet or oxygen tank.\n\n#### Anemia\n\nAnemia is a condition where the body's red blood cell count or hemoglobin levels are lower than normal, leading to a decrease in oxygen-carrying capacity.\n\n#### Histotoxic hypoxia\n\nHistotoxic hypoxia occurs when the body's tissues are poisoned by substances that interfere with oxygen utilization, leading to a decrease in oxygen supply.\n\n### By extent\n\nHypoxia can be classified based on its extent into several categories.\n\n#### Generalized hypoxia\n\nGeneralized hypoxia occurs when the entire body is affected by hypoxia.\n\n#### Localized hypoxia\n\nLocalized hypoxia occurs when a specific region of the body is affected by hypoxia.\n\n### By affected tissues and organs\n\nHypoxia can affect different tissues and organs in the body, leading to a range of signs and symptoms.\n\n#### Cerebral hypoxia\n\nCerebral hypoxia occurs when the brain is deprived of adequate oxygen supply. This can occur due to various reasons, such as cardiac arrest, stroke, or shock.\n\n#### Corneal hypoxia\n\nCorneal hypoxia occurs when the cornea is deprived of adequate oxygen supply. This can occur due to various reasons, such as contact lens wear or exposure to toxic substances.\n\n#### Intrauterine hypoxia\n\nIntrauterine hypoxia occurs when the fetus is deprived of adequate oxygen supply in the womb.\n\n#### Tumor hypoxia\n\nTumor hypoxia occurs when cancer cells are deprived of adequate oxygen supply, leading to a reduction in their growth and spread.\n\n#### Vestibular system\n\nVestibular system hypoxia occurs when the vestibular system, responsible for balance and spatial orientation, is affected by hypoxia.\n\nSigns and symptoms\n\nHypoxia can cause a range of signs and symptoms, from mild to severe.\n\n### Complications\n\nComplications of hypoxia can include respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, and death.\n\nCauses\n\nHypoxia can be caused by various factors, including ischemia, hypoxemic hypoxia, anemia, and histotoxic hypoxia.\n\n### Ischemia\n\nIschemia is a condition where the blood flow to a particular region of the body is restricted, leading to a decrease in oxygen supply.\n\n### Hypoxemic hypoxia\n\nHypoxemic hypoxia occurs when the blood's oxygen-carrying capacity is reduced, leading to a decrease in oxygen supply to the body's tissues.\n\nMechanism\n\nHypoxia occurs when the body's tissues are deprived of adequate oxygen supply.\n\n### Physiological responses\n\nThe body responds to hypoxia by increasing respiration, cardiac output, and peripheral vasodilation.\n\n### Acute\n\nAcute hypoxia occurs when the body is suddenly deprived of adequate oxygen supply.\n\n### Chronic\n\nChronic hypoxia occurs when the body is consistently deprived of adequate oxygen supply.\n\n### Pathological responses\n\nPathological responses to hypoxia can include cerebral ischemia, myocardial ischemia, and tumor angiogenesis.\n\nDiagnosis\n\nDiagnosis of hypoxia can be made through physical examination, history, and tests.\n\n### Physical examination and history\n\nPhysical examination and history can help diagnose hypoxia by identifying signs and symptoms.\n\n### Tests\n\nTests can help diagnose hypoxia by measuring oxygen saturation, blood pressure, and other parameters.\n\n### Differential diagnosis\n\nDifferential diagnosis can help diagnose hypoxia by ruling out other conditions.\n\nPrevention\n\nPrevention of hypoxia can be achieved through various means, including prevention of altitude-induced hypoxia.\n\n### Prevention of altitude-induced hypoxia\n\nPrevention of altitude-induced hypoxia can be achieved through acclimatization, medications, and oxygen therapy.\n\nTreatment and management\n\nTreatment and management of hypoxia can be achieved through various means, including oxygen therapy, medications, and surgical interventions.\n\n### Treatment of acute and chronic cases\n\nTreatment of acute and chronic cases of hypoxia can involve different approaches, including oxygen therapy, medications, and surgical interventions.\n\nOutcomes\n\nOutcomes of hypoxia can be severe and include respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, and death.\n\nEpidemiology\n\nEpidemiology of hypoxia can be studied by examining the prevalence, incidence, and risk factors of hypoxia.\n\n### Silent hypoxia\n\nSilent hypoxia occurs when individuals are unaware of their hypoxia due to a lack of symptoms.\n\nHistory\n\nHistory of hypoxia can be studied by examining the etymology and evolution of the concept of hypoxia.\n\n### Etymology\n\nEtymology of hypoxia can be studied by examining the origins of the term \"hypoxia\".\n\nSee also\n\nHypoxia can be related to various other conditions and concepts, including anemia, ischemia, and respiration.\n\nNotes\n\nHypoxia can be a serious condition that requires prompt medical attention.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

Goyer and based on the DC Comics character of the same name. The film is a spin-off of the 2013 film Man of Steel and is part of the DC Extended Universe (DCEU). The movie follows the story of Barry Allen, a crime scene investigator who gains superhuman speed after being struck by lightning.\n\nPlot\n\nThe film begins with Barry Allen, a Central City crime scene investigator, whose mother was killed in a house fire when he was a child. Barry's father, Henry Allen, is wrongly accused of the crime and is sent to prison. Barry grows up to become a crime scene investigator, driven by a desire to uncover the truth behind his mother's death.\n\nWhen a particle accelerator is activated in Central City, a massive storm hits the city, and Barry is struck by lightning. He is rushed to the hospital, where he is found to have gained superhuman speed.\n\nAs Barry struggles to understand and control his new powers, he becomes the Flash, a superhero who uses his speed to protect Central City from various threats. Barry teams up with his police chief, Nora Allen (played by Laura Vandervoort), and a scientist, Harrison Wells (played by John Wesley Shipp), to uncover the truth behind his mother's death and the particle accelerator.\n\nCast\n\n* Ezra Miller as Barry Allen / The Flash\n* John Wesley Shipp as Harrison Wells\n* Laura Vandervoort as Nora Allen\n* Kiefer Sutherland as Tom Curry\n* Rick Cosnett as Eddie Thawne\n* Tom Cavanagh as Eobard Thawne / The Reverse-Flash\n\nProduction\n\nDevelopment\n\nThe idea of a Flash film was first conceived in the early 2010s, with writer and director David S. Goyer attached to the project. Goyer was a fan of the character and wanted to create a film that would be more grounded and realistic than other superhero movies.\n\nEarly attempts\n\nIn 2012, it was announced that a Flash film was in development, with Goyer writing the script and Ryan Gosling set to star as the title character. However, the project stalled due to budget issues and Gosling's scheduling conflicts.\n\nDC Extended Universe\n\nIn 2013, Warner Bros. announced that a Flash film would be part of the DC Extended Universe (DCEU), a shared universe that would bring together various DC Comics characters. Goyer was still attached to the project, and the film would be a spin-off of the 2013 film Man of Steel.\n\nPre-production\n\nPre-production on the film began in 2013, with Goyer writing the script and director Andy and David S. Goyer attached to the project. The film would be a more grounded and realistic take on the character, with a focus on Barry's personal life and relationships.\n\nFilming\n\nFilming on the film began in April 2014 and wrapped in July 2014. The film was shot on location in Toronto, Canada, and featured a mix of practical and visual effects.\n\nPost-production\n\nPost-production on the film began in August 2014 and lasted several months. The film's visual effects were created by a team of artists and technicians at Warner Bros. and Animal Logic.\n\nMusic\n\nThe film's soundtrack was composed by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL. The soundtrack features a mix of electronic and orchestral elements, with a focus on Barry's theme.\n\nMarketing\n\nThe film's marketing campaign began in 2014, with a focus on building anticipation and excitement for the film. The campaign included a series of trailers and TV spots, as well as promotional tie-ins with various brands and partners.\n\nRelease\n\nTheatrical\n\nThe film was released in the United States on November 6, 2014, and in other countries in the following weeks. The film opened at number one at the box office, grossing over $100 million in its opening weekend.\n\nHome media\n\nThe film was released on DVD and Blu-ray in January 2015, and was a commercial success. The film's home video release included a number of bonus features, including deleted scenes and behind-the-scenes footage.\n\nReception\n\nBox office\n\nThe film was a commercial success, grossing over $360 million worldwide. The film's box office performance was seen as a success, given the challenges of launching a new superhero franchise.\n\nCritical response\n\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics, with some praising its visuals and action sequences, while others criticized its plot and characters. The film holds a 56% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 5.5 out of 10.\n\nAccolades\n\nThe film was nominated for several awards, including a Saturn Award for Best Superhero Film and a Fangoria Chainsaw Award for Best Makeup Effects.\n\nFuture\n\nIn 2016, it was announced that a sequel to the film was in development, with David S.

He was a prominent figure in the late 19th-century socialist and freethought movements in the United Kingdom. Aveling was a prolific writer, lecturer, and playwright, known for his advocacy of social and scientific reform.\n\n**Early years**\n\nEdward Aveling was born on July 3, 1849, in London, England. Little is known about his early life, but it is believed that he came from a working-class family. Aveling's early education was limited, and he began working as a factory worker at the age of 14. Despite his humble beginnings, Aveling was drawn to education and self-improvement, and he eventually secured a place at University College London (UCL).\n\n**University College London**\n\nAt UCL, Aveling studied science and literature, developing a strong interest in comparative anatomy. He was particularly influenced by the work of Thomas Henry Huxley, a leading British scientist and advocate of evolution. Aveling's time at UCL laid the foundation for his future career as a science writer and lecturer.\n\n**Cambridge**\n\nIn 1870, Aveling traveled to Cambridge to attend the first International Scientific Congress, where he met prominent scientists and intellectuals, including Charles Darwin. Aveling's encounter with Darwin had a profound impact on his worldview and shaped his future writing and activism.\n\n**College of Preceptors**\n\nAfter his time at Cambridge, Aveling returned to London and enrolled at the College of Preceptors, a training institution for teachers. He graduated with honors, which enabled him to secure a position as a lecturer on comparative anatomy at the London Hospital.\n\n**First marriage**\n\nAveling married Eleanor Marx, the daughter of Karl Marx, in 1884. The marriage was a tumultuous one, marked by periods of separation and infidelity. Despite their troubled relationship, the Avelings remained committed to their shared socialist and freethought ideals.\n\n**Lecturer on Comparative Anatomy at London Hospital**\n\nAveling's position at the London Hospital allowed him to develop his skills as a lecturer and science writer. He delivered numerous lectures on comparative anatomy, which were well-received by his audiences. Aveling's writing and lectures during this period demonstrate his early interest in popularizing scientific knowledge and promoting social reform.\n\n**New College, London**\n\nIn 1885, Aveling became a member of the Council of New College, London, a freethought organization dedicated to promoting scientific and social progress. His involvement with New College marked a significant shift in his career, as he began to focus more on social and political activism.\n\n**Professorship of English**\n\nAveling was appointed Professor of English at New College in 1886. Although his tenure as professor was short-lived, his appointment reflects his growing reputation as a scholar and intellectual.\n\n**Aveling's secularist credo**\n\nAveling was a committed secularist, and his writing and lectures often reflected his skepticism of traditional Christianity. He believed in the importance of reason and science in shaping human knowledge and society. Aveling's secularist credo was deeply influenced by his encounter with Darwin and his conviction in the power of natural selection.\n\n**National Secular Society and the Hall of Science**\n\nIn 1885, Aveling joined the National Secular Society, an organization dedicated to promoting secularism and social reform. He became a regular contributor to the society's publications and participated in its activities, including the construction of the Hall of Science in London.\n\n**Aveling as interim editor of Foote's Progress and The Freethinker**\n\nAveling served as interim editor of Foote's Progress and The Freethinker, two prominent freethought journals. During his tenure, he published numerous articles and essays on science, politics, and literature, cementing his reputation as a progressive intellectual.\n\n**Political career**\n\nAveling's involvement in politics began in the late 1880s, when he became active in the Social Democratic Federation (SDF). He was a vocal advocate for socialism and democratic reform, and he delivered numerous speeches and lectures on these topics.\n\n**The American journey of agitation 1886**\n\nIn 1886, Aveling embarked on a journey to the United States, where he delivered a series of lectures on socialism and democracy. His American tour was a significant milestone in his career, as he met prominent American intellectuals and politicians, including Henry George.\n\n**Second American journey of 1888**\n\nAveling returned to the United States in 1888, where he continued his advocacy of socialism and democracy. His second American tour was marked by controversy, as he clashed with his hosts and critics.\n\n**Aveling as a Playwright**\n\nIn addition to his writing and lecturing, Aveling was a talented playwright. He wrote several plays, including \"The Illustrious Prince\" and \"The Master of the Paris Commune.\" Aveling's plays reflect his interest in drama and his commitment to social and political reform.\n\n**The Avelings and Ibsen**\n\nAveling was a great admirer of Henrik Ibsen, the Norwegian playwright. He was particularly drawn to Ibsen's use of drama to explore social and political issues. Aveling's own plays were influenced by Ibsen's work, and he often incorporated Ibsen's themes and ideas into his writing.\n\n**Aveling and Darwin**\n\nAveling's relationship with Darwin was complex and multifaceted. He was deeply influenced by Darwin's work on evolution and natural selection, and he often incorporated Darwin's ideas into his writing and lectures. Despite their differences, Aveling and Darwin maintained a cordial relationship until Darwin's death in 1882.\n\n**Aveling and Haeckel**\n\nAveling was also influenced by Ernst Haeckel, a German biologist and philosopher. Haeckel's work on evolution and natural selection was widely admired by Aveling, who often incorporated Haeckel's ideas into his writing and lectures.\n\n**Aveling's publication of Darwin's letter to Marx**\n\nIn 1886, Aveling published a letter from Darwin to Marx, which revealed a previously unknown letter from Darwin to the famous socialist. Aveling's publication of the letter was a significant event in the history of socialism and Darwinism.\n\n**Later life, death and legacy**\n\nAveling's later life was marked by personal and professional turmoil. He continued to write and lecture, but his health began to decline. He died on August 29, 1898, at the age of 49. Aveling's legacy as a socialist, atheist, and science writer was cemented by his contributions to the freethought and socialist movements.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nEdward Aveling's legacy extends beyond his writing and lecturing. He was a pioneering figure in the history of socialism and Darwinism, and his contributions to the freethought movement helped shape modern intellectual discourse. Aveling's commitment to reason and science continues to inspire scholars and intellectuals today.\n\n**Publications by Edward Aveling**\n\n**Selected writings**\n\n* \"The Illustrious Prince\" (play, 1887)\n* \"The Master of the Paris Commune\" (play, 1888)\n* \"The Darwin-Marx Letters\" (1886)\n* \"The Aveling-Haeckel Correspondence\" (1889)\n\n**Scientific writings**\n\n* \"On the Origin of Species, by Charles Darwin\" (1887)\n* \"The Descent of Man, by Charles Darwin\" (1888)\n* \"The Expression of Emotions in Man and Animals, by Charles Darwin\" (1889)\n\n**Writings coauthored with Eleanor**\n\n* \"The Woman Question\" (1888)\n* \"The Labour Movement\" (1889)\n\n**Translations**\n\n* \"The Communist Manifesto, by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels\" (1887)\n* \"The Origin of Species, by Charles Darwin\" (1888)\n\n**Notes**\n\nAveling's life and work are a testament to the power of reason and science in shaping human knowledge and society.
