The concept of anti-Zionism has evolved over time, influenced by various factors, including the rise of nationalism, socialism, and Islamism.\n\n**Anti-Zionism before 1948**\n\n### Early Jewish anti-Zionism\n\nThe early days of Zionism saw opposition from within the Jewish community. Some Jews, such as the Hovevei Zion, advocated for a Jewish homeland in Palestine, but with a more gradual approach. Others, like the Jewish secularist and socialist movement, rejected the idea of a Jewish state, arguing that it would perpetuate Jewish nationalism and segregation. This early Jewish anti-Zionism was often linked to the rejection of Jewish nationalism and the emphasis on assimilation into European societies.\n\n### Early Arab anti-Zionism\n\nThe Arab population in Palestine, predominantly Muslim and Christian, had long inhabited the region. Before the rise of Zionism, they had their own nationalist aspirations, which were often linked to the idea of Arab unity. When Zionism emerged, Arab leaders and intellectuals began to view it as a threat to their own national identity and interests. This early Arab anti-Zionism was driven by concerns about land ownership, economic exploitation, and the perceived threat to Arab culture and traditions.\n\n### Reactions to the Balfour Declaration\n\nIn 1917, the British government issued the Balfour Declaration, which expressed support for the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. This document was met with widespread condemnation from the Arab population, who saw it as a betrayal of British promises to protect their rights and interests in the region. The Arab Revolt of 1916-1918, led by Sharif Hussein, was a direct response to the Balfour Declaration and the Zionist movement.\n\n### Anti-Zionism in the 1920s–1930s\n\nIn the interwar period, anti-Zionism continued to grow in strength, particularly among Arab nationalist movements. The Mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Amin al-Husseini, became a prominent figure in the anti-Zionist movement, advocating for the Palestinian cause and opposing Jewish immigration to Palestine. Meanwhile, Jewish anti-Zionist groups, such as the Jewish National Workers' Alliance, continued to argue that a Jewish state would be a backward step for Jewish people and that they should focus on building a socialist society in Palestine.\n\n### The Biltmore programme and its anti-Zionism fall-out\n\nIn 1942, the Zionist movement adopted the Biltmore programme, which called for the establishment of a Jewish state in all of Palestine, including the partition of Arab lands. This move was widely seen as a provocation by the Arab population and led to increased anti-Zionist sentiment. The Biltmore programme also sparked a split within the Jewish community, with some groups opposing the idea of a Jewish state and others embracing it.\n\n### Religious\n\nVarious religious groups have held anti-Zionist views, often based on interpretations of scripture and tradition. Some Christian denominations, such as the Greek Orthodox Church, have historically opposed the idea of a Jewish state, seeing it as a threat to Christian interests and rights in the region. Similarly, some Islamic leaders have argued that the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine would be a betrayal of Islamic principles and a challenge to the rights of Muslim populations.\n\n**Anti-Zionism after World War II and the creation of Israel**\n\n### 1947–1948\n\nThe creation of the State of Israel in 1948 was met with widespread condemnation from Arab states and leaders, who saw it as an illegal occupation of Palestinian land. The Arab-Israeli War of 1948-1949 was a direct response to the establishment of Israel, with many Arab countries participating in the conflict.\n\n### Soviet Union\n\nThe Soviet Union was a key player in the international affairs of the Middle East during the Cold War. While the Soviet Union supported the creation of Israel in 1948, it later became a vocal critic of Israeli policy, particularly with regards to the treatment of Palestinian refugees. The Soviet Union saw Israel as a Western-backed state and a threat to Soviet interests in the region.\n\n### Arab and Palestinian anti-Zionism\n\nArab and Palestinian anti-Zionism has continued to be a dominant theme in regional politics, with many leaders and intellectuals advocating for the rights of the Palestinian people and the rejection of Israeli occupation. The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) has been a key player in the anti-Zionist movement, advocating for Palestinian self-determination and the establishment of a Palestinian state.\n\n### Perception of Zionism as racism\n\nSome critics of Zionism have argued that it is a racist ideology, perpetuating the idea of a Jewish supremacy over non-Jewish populations. This view is often linked to the notion that Zionism is a form of colonialism, in which a minority group seeks to dominate and exploit a majority population.\n\n### During the Cold War\n\nDuring the Cold War, anti-Zionism became a key aspect of Soviet foreign policy, with the Soviet Union advocating for the rights of Arab and Palestinian populations and condemning Israeli actions. This led to a significant increase in anti-Zionist sentiment among socialist and communist groups around the world.\n\n### After the Cold War\n\nIn the post-Cold War era, anti-Zionism has continued to evolve, with many critics of Zionism focusing on issues such as human rights, land rights, and the treatment of Palestinian refugees. The Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement, launched in 2005, has been a key player in the anti-Zionist movement, advocating for boycotts of Israeli products and companies.\n\n### Islamic perspectives\n\nIslamic perspectives on Zionism vary widely, with some Muslim leaders and intellectuals advocating for a peaceful resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and others promoting a more radical anti-Zionist stance. The Iranian government, for example, has been a vocal critic of Zionism and has called for the destruction of the State of Israel.\n\n### Left-wing politics\n\nLeft-wing politics have long been associated with anti-Zionism, with many socialist and communist groups advocating for the rights of the Palestinian people and the rejection of Israeli occupation. The BDS movement, for example, has been driven by left-wing activists and has gained significant support from progressive groups around the world.\n\n### Christian anti-Zionism\n\nChristian anti-Zionism has a long history, with some Christian denominations and leaders opposing the idea of a Jewish state in Palestine. The Catholic Church, for example, has historically been critical of Zionism and has called for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\n#### Protestants\n\nProtestant churches have also been critical of Zionism, with some leaders arguing that it is a form of colonialism and a threat to Christian interests in the region. The Presbyterian Church, for example, has called for boycotts of Israeli products and companies.\n\n#### Catholics\n\nThe Catholic Church has a long history of criticism of Zionism, with Pope Pius XI calling for the establishment of a Jewish homeland in 1920. However, the Vatican has also called for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and has criticized Israeli actions in the region.\n\n### Haredi Judaism\n\nHaredi Judaism, a branch of Orthodox Judaism, has also been associated with anti-Zionism, with some Haredi leaders and intellectuals rejecting the idea of a Jewish state in Palestine. The Satmar Hasidic dynasty, for example, has been critical of Zionism and has advocated for a more traditionalist approach to Jewish identity and community.\n\n**Allegations of antisemitism**\n\n### Jewish right to a state\n\nCritics of anti-Zionism have argued that it is often linked to antisemitism, with some anti-Zionist activists advocating for the rejection of Jewish identity and the erasure of Jewish culture. This view is often linked to the notion that anti-Zionism is a form of \"new antisemitism,\" in which Jewish people are viewed as a threat to non-Jewish populations and are subjected to hatred and discrimination.\n\n### Equating and correlating anti-Zionism with antisemitism\n\nSome critics of anti-Zionism have argued that it is often used as a euphemism for antisemitism, with some anti-Zionist activists advocating for the rejection of Jewish identity and the erasure of Jewish culture. This view is often linked to the notion that anti-Zionism is a form of \"new antisemitism,\" in which Jewish people are viewed as a threat to non-Jewish populations and are subjected to hatred and discrimination.\n\n### View that the two are not interlinked\n\nOthers have argued that anti-Zionism and antisemitism are not necessarily linked, with some anti-Zionist activists advocating for the rights of the Palestinian people and the rejection of Israeli occupation without promoting hatred or discrimination against Jewish people. This view is often linked to the notion that anti-Zionism is a legitimate form of critique of Israeli policy and a defense of Palestinian rights.\n\n### Shifting positions on the Zionist/Anti-Zionist spectrum\n\nThe relationship between anti-Zionism and antisemitism has been the subject of much debate and controversy, with some critics of anti-Zionism arguing that it is a form of antisemitism and others arguing that it is a legitimate form of critique of Israeli policy. The shifting positions on the Zionist/Anti-Zionist spectrum have been influenced by a range of factors, including the rise of nationalism, socialism, and Islamism, as well as the changing nature of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\n### Far-right politics\n\nFar-right politics have often been associated with anti-Zionism, with some far-right groups advocating for the rejection of Jewish identity and the erasure of Jewish culture. This view is often linked to the notion that Jewish people are viewed as a threat to non-Jewish populations and are subjected to hatred and discrimination.\n\n### Conspiracy theories\n\nConspiracy theories have also been associated with anti-Zionism, with some anti-Zionist activists advocating for the rejection of Jewish identity and the erasure of Jewish culture. This view is often linked to the notion that Jewish people are viewed as a threat to non-Jewish populations and are subjected to hatred and discrimination.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Zionism\n* Israel\n* Palestine\n* Arab-Israeli conflict\n* Jewish identity\n* Jewish nationalism\n* Jewish diaspora\n* Jewish anti-Zionism\n* Arab anti-Zionism\n* Islamic anti-Zionism\n* Christian anti-Zionism\n* Haredi Judaism\n* Satmar Hasidic dynasty\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is a summary of the history and evolution of anti-Zionism, including its various forms and manifestations.\n* The article is written in a neutral and encyclopedic tone, with a focus on providing factual information and avoiding personal opinions or biases.\n* The article is divided into sections and subsections, with headings and subheadings to provide clarity and organization.\n* The article includes references to various sources and citations, but these are not included in this version of the article.\n* The article is intended to provide a comprehensive overview of anti-Zionism, but it is not exhaustive and may not cover all aspects or perspectives on the topic.\n\n**Sources**\n\n* This article is a summary of various sources, including:\n\t+ Books and academic papers on the history and evolution of anti-Zionism\n\t+ News articles and reports on anti-Zionism and its various forms and manifestations\n\t+ Online resources and websites dedicated to the topic of anti-Zionism\n\t+ Primary sources, including speeches, letters, and other documents from key figures and events in the history of anti-Zionism.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The recognition of the DPR and LPR has been a highly controversial and complex issue, with different countries and organizations taking different stances.\n\n**History**\n\nThe Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic were declared independent on April 7, 2014, by their respective leaders, Denis Pushilin and Igor Plotnitsky. The declarations followed the ousting of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych and the subsequent conflict between Ukrainian authorities and the pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. The conflict escalated into a full-blown war, with the Ukrainian government launching military operations against the DPR and LPR.\n\nIn response to the declarations of independence, the Russian government recognized the DPR and LPR as independent states on February 21, 2019. This move was seen as a major escalation of the conflict and sparked international condemnation.\n\n**Aftermath of Russian Recognition**\n\nThe recognition of the DPR and LPR by Russia sparked a diplomatic crisis between Russia and Ukraine, with the Ukrainian government accusing Russia of violating Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The international community also responded with condemnation, with many countries and organizations calling for a peaceful resolution to the conflict.\n\nThe recognition of the DPR and LPR by Russia also led to an increase in tensions between Russia and Western countries, with the United States and European Union imposing sanctions on Russia in response.\n\n**Countries and Entities that Recognized the DPR and LPR as Independent States**\n\n### UN Member States\n\n* Russia recognized the DPR and LPR as independent states on February 21, 2019.\n* Nicaragua recognized the DPR and LPR as independent states on May 25, 2018.\n* Venezuela recognized the DPR and LPR as independent states on May 9, 2018.\n\n### Non-UN States\n\n* The Syrian Arab Republic recognized the DPR and LPR as independent states on June 30, 2018.\n* The Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, a self-declared state in Azerbaijan, recognized the DPR and LPR as independent states on June 30, 2018.\n\n**Positions by Other Countries**\n\n### Countries and Entities that Supported Recognizing the DPR and LPR as Independent States\n\n#### UN Member States\n\n* Belarus has been critical of Ukraine's actions in eastern Ukraine and has called for a peaceful resolution to the conflict.\n* Kazakhstan has also called for a peaceful resolution to the conflict and has expressed support for the DPR and LPR.\n\n### Countries and Entities that Did Not Support Recognizing the DPR and LPR as Independent States\n\n#### UN Member States\n\n* The United States has consistently condemned the actions of the DPR and LPR and has called for a peaceful resolution to the conflict.\n* Canada has also condemned the actions of the DPR and LPR and has expressed support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n* The United Kingdom has also condemned the actions of the DPR and LPR and has expressed support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\n#### Non-UN States\n\n* Georgia has also condemned the actions of the DPR and LPR and has expressed support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\n#### International and Regional Organizations\n\n* The European Union has condemned the actions of the DPR and LPR and has called for a peaceful resolution to the conflict.\n* The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) has also condemned the actions of the DPR and LPR and has called for a peaceful resolution to the conflict.\n* The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has also condemned the actions of the DPR and LPR and has called for a peaceful resolution to the conflict.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Conflict in Eastern Ukraine\n* Ukrainian-Russian crisis\n* Annexation of Crimea by Russia\n* History of Ukraine\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is based on publicly available information and has not been verified by independent sources.\n* The information provided is subject to change and may not reflect the current situation.\n* The article is intended to provide a neutral and informative overview of the international recognition of the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

Rowling, is a British novelist, screenwriter, and philanthropist best known for writing the Harry Potter fantasy series. Born on July 31, 1965, in Yate, Gloucestershire, England, Rowling's life has been marked by both personal struggles and professional success, which has made her one of the most popular and successful authors of all time.\n\n**Life and Career**\n\n### Early Life and Family\n\nJoanne Kathleen Rowling was born to Peter and Anne Rowling, a Rolls-Royce aircraft engineer and a science technician, respectively. Her family moved to Winterbourne, near Bristol, when she was a year old. Rowling's early life was marked by a close relationship with her parents, particularly her mother, who instilled in her a love for reading and writing. Rowling has described her childhood as \"blissful\" and has credited her parents with providing her with a stable and supportive environment.\n\n### Secondary School and University\n\nRowling attended St. Michael's Primary School in Winterbourne and later went to Wyedean Comprehensive School in Gloucestershire. She developed a love for writing during her school years, and her first story, \"Rabbit,\" was written at the age of six. After completing her secondary education, Rowling attended the University of Exeter, where she studied French and Classics. However, she dropped out of university in her third year due to financial constraints.\n\n### Inspiration and Mother's Death\n\nRowling's mother, Anne, died of multiple sclerosis in 1990, which had a profound impact on her life. The loss of her mother inspired Rowling to create the character of Harry Potter, who also lost his parents at a young age. Rowling has stated that her mother's death was a significant turning point in her life, and it motivated her to pursue a career in writing.\n\n### Marriage, Divorce, and Single Parenthood\n\nRowling married Portuguese journalist Jorge Arantes in 1992, and they had a daughter, Jessica, in 1993. However, the couple divorced in 1995 due to financial difficulties. Rowling struggled to make ends meet as a single mother, relying on welfare benefits and teaching English as a foreign language to make a living.\n\n### Publishing Harry Potter\n\nRowling's big break came in 1995 when Bloomsbury agreed to publish her manuscript for Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. The book was a moderate success upon its release in 1997, but it was the subsequent books in the series that catapulted Rowling to international fame. The Harry Potter series has since become a cultural phenomenon, with the books being translated into over 80 languages and sold more than 500 million copies worldwide.\n\n### Films\n\nThe Harry Potter film series, produced by Warner Bros., was a massive commercial success, grossing over $7.7 billion at the box office. Rowling was closely involved in the production of the films, serving as a producer and screenwriter. The series won numerous awards, including several Academy Awards, BAFTAs, and Golden Globes.\n\n### Religion, Wealth, and Remarriage\n\nRowling has stated that she is an atheist, but she has also expressed her respect for other religions. She has been open about her struggles with poverty and her experiences as a single mother. Rowling's wealth has enabled her to establish the Volant Charitable Trust, which supports various charitable causes, including multiple sclerosis research, literacy programs, and women's rights.\n\n### Adult Fiction and Robert Galbraith\n\nRowling published her first adult novel, The Casual Vacancy, in 2012, which received mixed reviews from critics. However, her subsequent novels, including The Cuckoo's Calling and Career of Evil, written under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith, have been highly praised for their complexity and depth.\n\n### Later Harry Potter Works\n\nRowling has continued to write in the Harry Potter universe, publishing several companion books, including Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them and The Tales of Beedle the Bard. She has also written a play, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, which premiered in London's West End in 2016.\n\n### Children's Stories\n\nRowling has written several children's stories, including The Ickabog, which was published in 2020. The story follows the adventures of a young boy and his friends as they navigate a magical kingdom.\n\n**Influences**\n\nRowling's work has been influenced by a wide range of sources, including mythology, folklore, and fairy tales. She has cited authors such as J.R.R. Tolkien, Philip Pullman, and Roald Dahl as inspirations for her writing. Rowling's love of mythology and folklore is evident in the richly detailed world-building that is characteristic of the Harry Potter series.\n\n**Style and Themes**\n\n### Style and Allusions\n\nRowling's writing style is characterized by its accessibility, wit, and depth. She has a unique ability to blend complex themes and ideas with engaging storytelling. Rowling's use of allusions to mythology, folklore, and fairy tales adds depth and richness to her stories, making them feel both familiar and new.\n\n### Themes\n\nRowling's work explores a wide range of themes, including friendship, love, prejudice, and power. The Harry Potter series, in particular, explores the struggle between good and evil, with the ultimate triumph of love and friendship over hatred and intolerance. Rowling's stories often feature complex, nuanced characters, and her exploration of themes is both subtle and profound.\n\n**Reception**\n\n### Gender and Social Division\n\nRowling's work has been praised for its portrayal of strong, independent female characters and its exploration of themes related to social division and prejudice. The Harry Potter series, in particular, has been credited with helping to break down social barriers and promote greater understanding and tolerance.\n\n### Religious Reactions\n\nRowling's work has been subject to various religious criticisms, with some arguing that her portrayal of magic and the supernatural is sacrilegious. However, Rowling has stated that she is an atheist and that her work is not intended to promote any particular religious agenda.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nRowling's legacy as a writer and philanthropist is impressive, with her stories and characters becoming an integral part of popular culture. Her work has inspired countless readers and writers around the world, and her philanthropic efforts have made a significant impact on various charitable causes.\n\n**Legal Disputes**\n\nRowling has been involved in several high-profile lawsuits, including a dispute with her former agent and a lawsuit against a fan who created a fake Harry Potter encyclopedia. However, these disputes have not detracted from her reputation as a respected and accomplished author.\n\n**Philanthropy**\n\nRowling's philanthropic efforts have been focused on various charitable causes, including multiple sclerosis research, literacy programs, and women's rights. Her Volant Charitable Trust has made significant contributions to these causes, and her generosity has inspired others to follow in her footsteps.\n\n**Views**\n\n### Politics\n\nRowling has expressed her views on various political issues, including poverty, inequality, and human rights. However, she has stated that she is not a politician and does not intend to engage in partisan politics.\n\n### Press\n\nRowling has been the subject of various media scrutiny, with some critics accusing her of being overly sensitive and others praising her for her dedication to her craft. However, she has maintained a professional demeanor throughout, and her commitment to her work has earned her widespread respect.\n\n### Transgender People\n\nRowling has been a vocal supporter of transgender rights, and her views on the issue have been widely reported. However, she has also faced criticism from some in the LGBTQ+ community for her comments on the issue.\n\n**Awards and Honours**\n\nRowling has received numerous awards and honors for her work, including the Order of the British Empire, the National Book Award, and the Hugo Award.

The trial is centered around allegations of tax evasion, falsification of business records, and other financial crimes.\n\n**Background**\n\n#### Stormy Daniels–Donald Trump scandal\n\nThe Stormy Daniels–Donald Trump scandal involved adult film actress Stormy Daniels, who alleged that she had an affair with Trump in 2006. Daniels claimed that Trump's personal attorney, Michael Cohen, paid her $130,000 in hush money to keep the affair quiet. The scandal led to a lawsuit against Trump, which was eventually settled out of court.\n\n#### Manhattan DA investigation and grand jury\n\nIn 2022, the Manhattan District Attorney's office, led by Alvin Bragg, began investigating Trump's business dealings, including his use of tax write-offs and other financial practices. The investigation led to the formation of a grand jury, which indicted Trump on multiple charges in April 2023.\n\n#### Eligibility for president\n\nThere has been controversy over whether Trump's indictment and potential conviction would affect his eligibility to run for president in future elections. Some argue that a conviction on federal charges would disqualify him from holding public office, while others argue that state-level charges would not have the same effect.\n\n**Initial Proceedings**\n\n#### Indictment and charges\n\nOn April 4, 2023, Trump was indicted by a grand jury on multiple charges, including tax evasion, falsification of business records, and conspiracy.

JWST is the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope and is designed to observe the universe in infrared light, with a primary mirror that is 21.3 feet (6.5 meters) in diameter.\n\n**Features**\n\n### Location and Orbit\n\nJWST is located in a halo orbit around the second Lagrange point (L2), which is about 1.5 million kilometers (932,000 miles) from Earth. This location allows the telescope to maintain a stable temperature and observe the universe with minimal interference from the Earth's atmosphere.\n\n### Sunshield Protection\n\nTo protect the telescope's sensitive optics from the intense heat of the Sun, JWST is equipped with a sunshield made of a thin, lightweight material. The sunshield is designed to reflect the Sun's radiation away from the telescope, maintaining a temperature of around 40 K (-233°C) in the observatory's science instruments.\n\n### Optics\n\nJWST's primary mirror is a segmented, hexagonal mirror made of 18 beryllium panels. The mirror is designed to collect light from distant objects and focus it onto the telescope's science instruments. The primary mirror is 21.3 feet (6.5 meters) in diameter and has a total surface area of about 25 square meters (270 square feet).\n\n### Scientific Instruments\n\nJWST is equipped with four science instruments:\n\n* **NIRCam (Near-Infrared Camera)**: a high-resolution camera that will observe the universe in the near-infrared spectrum.\n* **NIRSpec (Near-Infrared Spectrograph)**: a spectrograph that will analyze the light from distant stars and galaxies.\n* **MIRI (Mid-Infrared Instrument)**: a camera and spectrograph that will observe the universe in the mid-infrared spectrum.\n* **FGS/NIRISS (Fine Guidance Sensor/Near-Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph)**: a camera and spectrograph that will provide high-resolution images of the universe in the near-infrared spectrum.\n\n### Spacecraft Bus\n\nThe spacecraft bus is the structure that carries the telescope's science instruments and supports the sunshield. The spacecraft bus is made of a lightweight material and is designed to be highly stable and precise.\n\n### Servicing\n\nJWST is designed to be serviced by astronauts, who will be able to perform routine maintenance and repairs on the telescope. The telescope is equipped with a robotic arm that will allow astronauts to access and manipulate the science instruments.\n\n### Software\n\nJWST's software is designed to control the telescope's operations and provide data to the science instruments. The software is based on a modular architecture that allows for easy updating and customization.\n\n**Comparison with other telescopes**\n\nJWST is the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope and is designed to observe the universe in infrared light, whereas Hubble observes the universe in visible light. JWST is also more sensitive and has a larger primary mirror than Hubble.\n\n**Development history**\n\n### Background (development to 2003)\n\nThe development of JWST began in the early 1990s, with a project definition study that was completed in 1994.

This article explores notable sets that achieve this feat, composers who wrote multiple sets, variants, and historical contexts.\n\nNotable sets that cover all 24 keys\n\nSeveral composers have written sets of music that cover all 24 keys. These sets often take the form of suites, collections of pieces, or large-scale instrumental works. Some notable examples include:\n\n* Johann Sebastian Bach's _Das Wohltemperierte Klavier_ (The Well-Tempered Clavier), a set of 48 preludes and fugues for harpsichord, each written in a different key.\n* Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's _Eine Kleine Gigue in G major_ (K. 574), a single piece that modulates through all 24 keys.\n* Felix Mendelssohn's _Songs without Words_ (Lieder ohne Worte), a set of six piano pieces, each written in a different key.\n* Arnold Bax's _Three Preludes_ (Op. 33), a set of three piano pieces, each written in a different key.\n\nComposers who wrote multiple sets\n\nSeveral composers have written multiple sets of music that cover all 24 keys. Some notable examples include:\n\n* Johann Sebastian Bach, who wrote several sets, including _Das Wohltemperierte Klavier_ and _Clavier-Übung_ (The Well-Tempered Clavier, Part 2).\n* Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, who wrote several sets, including _Eine Kleine Gigue in G major_ and _Theme and Variations_ (K. 502).\n* Felix Mendelssohn, who wrote several sets, including _Songs without Words_ and _Lieder ohne Worte_ (Op. 19).\n\nVariants\n\nThere are several variants of music written in all major or minor keys. Some notable examples include:\n\n* Single pieces that modulate through many keys: These are pieces that start in one key and modulate through several other keys before returning to the original key. Examples include Mozart's _Eine Kleine Gigue in G major_ and Beethoven's _Piano Sonata No. 13 in E flat major_ (Op. 27, No. 1).\n* Works covering all eight church modes: These are pieces that use all eight church modes, which are the ancient modes used in Gregorian chant. Examples include Bach's _The Well-Tempered Clavier_ and Mendelssohn's _Songs without Words_.\n* Other sets of 24 pieces: These are sets that consist of 24 pieces, each written in a different key. Examples include the _24 Preludes and Fugues_ by Johann Sebastian Bach and the _24 Preludes_ by Alexander Scriabin.\n\nKeys\n\nThe 24 keys of the chromatic scale are:\n\nC major, C# minor, Db major, D minor, D# major, Eb minor, E major, F minor, F# major, G minor, G# major, Ab minor, A major, Bb minor, B major, C minor, C major, C# minor, Db major, D minor, D# major, Eb minor, E major, F minor.\n\nThe order of keys in published works is often determined by the composer's intention or by the historical context in which the work was written. For example, Bach's _Das Wohltemperierte Klavier_ is organized by key, with each book containing 24 preludes and fugues, each written in a different key.\n\nHistory\n\nMusic written in all major or minor keys has a long history, dating back to the Renaissance period. Some notable milestones include:\n\nBach and his precursors\n\nJohann Sebastian Bach was a key figure in the development of music written in all major or minor keys. His _Das Wohltemperierte Klavier_ is a seminal work that sets the standard for this type of composition. Bach's precursors, such as Frescobaldi and Froberger, also wrote music that covered all 24 keys.\n\nAfter Bach\n\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, music written in all major or minor keys became more widespread. Composers such as Mozart, Beethoven, and Chopin wrote music that covered all 24 keys, often in the form of suites or collections of pieces. The 20th century saw a decline in this type of composition, but it experienced a resurgence in the latter half of the century.\n\n18th and 19th centuries\n\nIn the 18th century, composers such as Mozart and Haydn wrote music that covered all 24 keys. Mozart's _Eine Kleine Gigue in G major_ is a notable example, while Haydn's _Piano Sonata No. 52 in E minor_ (Hob. XVI: 35) also covers all 24 keys.\n\n1851–1900\n\nIn the 19th century, composers such as Chopin and Brahms wrote music that covered all 24 keys. Chopin's _Piano Sonata No. 3 in B minor_ (Op. 58) is a notable example, while Brahms's _Piano Sonata No. 3 in F minor_ (Op. 5) also covers all 24 keys.\n\n20th century\n\nIn the 20th century, music written in all major or minor keys experienced a decline, but it experienced a resurgence in the latter half of the century. Composers such as Stravinsky, Shostakovich, and Bartok wrote music that covered all 24 keys, often in the form of instrumental works or large-scale compositions.\n\n1901–1950\n\nIn the early 20th century, composers such as Stravinsky and Bartok wrote music that covered all 24 keys. Stravinsky's _Piano Sonata No. 1_ (1917) is a notable example, while Bartok's _Piano Sonata No. 1_ (1926) also covers all 24 keys.\n\n1951–2000\n\nIn the latter half of the 20th century, composers such as Shostakovich and Messiaen wrote music that covered all 24 keys. Shostakovich's _Piano Sonata No. 2_ (1950) is a notable example, while Messiaen's _Vingt Regards sur l'Enfant-Jésus_ (1944) also covers all 24 keys.\n\n21st century\n\nIn the 21st century, music written in all major or minor keys continues to be written by composers such as Kaija Saariaho, Arvo Pärt, and Thomas Adès. These composers often use new technologies and innovative techniques to create music that covers all 24 keys.\n\nNotes\n\n* Music written in all major or minor keys is often used in film and video game soundtracks to create a sense of drama and tension.\n* The use of all 24 keys can create a sense of musical satiation, as the listener is exposed to a wide range of musical ideas and emotions.\n* Music written in all major or minor keys can also be used to create a sense of musical unity, as the different pieces and sections are all connected by a common key or musical theme.\n\nReferences\n\n* Bach, J.

The reform has sparked intense debate and controversy in Israel, with proponents arguing that it will increase the power of the elected branches and opponents claiming that it will undermine the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe Israeli judicial system has a long history of controversy and debate, dating back to the 1992 Constitutional Revolution, which saw the introduction of a new Basic Law that enshrined the principles of democracy and the rule of law. However, in recent years, there have been growing tensions between the judiciary and the elected branches, particularly the government and the Knesset. The 2023 judicial reform is the latest chapter in this ongoing saga, and its implications are far-reaching and profound.\n\n**Israeli Supreme Court and Judicial Review**\n\nThe Israeli Supreme Court is the highest court in the land, with the power to review and strike down any law or government act that is deemed unconstitutional or unreasonable. The court has been a key institution in Israeli democracy, providing a check on the power of the elected branches and ensuring that the rights of citizens are protected.\n\nHowever, the court has also been the subject of controversy and criticism, particularly from some politicians and interest groups who have accused it of being too liberal or too interventionist. Some have argued that the court has overstepped its bounds and has become too politicized, while others have claimed that it has failed to adequately protect the rights of certain groups, such as ultra-Orthodox Jews.\n\n**1992 Constitutional Revolution and its Discontents**\n\nThe 1992 Constitutional Revolution was a major turning point in Israeli history, marking a shift towards a more liberal and democratic system. The new Basic Law enshrined the principles of democracy, equality, and human rights, and provided for the establishment of an independent judiciary.\n\nHowever, the revolution was not without its discontents. Some politicians and interest groups felt that the new system was too liberal or too secular, and that it did not adequately protect the interests of certain groups, such as ultra-Orthodox Jews. These criticisms were fueled by the fact that the new system gave the judiciary a significant role in shaping the country's laws and policies.\n\n**2018–2022 Israeli Political Crisis and 2022 Legislative Election**\n\nThe 2018–2022 Israeli political crisis was a major turning point in the country's history, marked by a series of elections, government collapses, and intense controversy. The crisis saw the rise of a new right-wing government, led by the Likud party, which was determined to implement a series of reforms to the judicial system.\n\nThe 2022 legislative election saw the Likud party win a majority of seats in the Knesset, and the new government was formed under the leadership of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The new government was determined to implement a series of reforms to the judicial system, including the 2023 judicial reform.\n\n**Legislative History**\n\nThe 2023 judicial reform was first introduced in the Knesset in 2023, as a series of bills aimed at reforming the judicial system. The bills were sponsored by the Likud party and its allies, and were designed to give the elected branches greater power over the judiciary.\n\nThe first bill, HCJ 5658/23, was submitted to the Knesset in 2023, and was aimed at reforming the process of judicial selection. The bill proposed to give the government greater control over the appointment of judges, and to limit the power of the Supreme Court to review and strike down laws and government acts.\n\n**HCJ 5658/23 Movement for Quality Government in Israel v. Knesset (2024)**\n\nIn 2024, the Movement for Quality Government in Israel, a non-profit organization, challenged the constitutionality of the bill in the Supreme Court. The court ruled that the bill was unconstitutional, but the ruling was later overturned by the Knesset.\n\n**Proposed Changes**\n\nThe 2023 judicial reform proposes a series of changes to the judicial system, including:\n\n**Judicial Selection**\n\n### Current System\n\nUnder the current system, judges are appointed by the President of Israel, on the recommendation of the Judicial Selection Committee. The committee is composed of representatives from the government, the Knesset, and the judiciary.\n\n### Proposed System\n\nUnder the proposed system, judges would be appointed by the government, on the recommendation of the Minister of Justice. The Minister would have the power to veto any appointment, and the President would have limited power to review and approve appointments.\n\n### Arguments in Favor of the Reform\n\nProponents of the reform argue that it will increase the power of the elected branches and ensure that the judiciary is more accountable to the people. They claim that the current system is too liberal or too secular, and that it has failed to protect the rights of certain groups, such as ultra-Orthodox Jews.\n\n### Arguments Against the Reform\n\nOpponents of the reform argue that it will undermine the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law. They claim that the current system is designed to protect the rights of all citizens, regardless of their background or beliefs. They also argue that the proposed system will give too much power to the government and the Minister of Justice, and that it will create a culture of cronyism and corruption.\n\n**Government Legal Advisors**\n\nThe 2023 judicial reform also proposes to give the government more control over the appointment of government legal advisors. The advisors would be appointed by the Minister of Justice, and would have the power to advise the government on legal matters.\n\n**Constitutional Review**\n\nThe reform also proposes to limit the power of the Supreme Court to review and strike down laws and government acts. The court would only be able to review laws and acts that are deemed unconstitutional or unreasonable.\n\n**Override Clause**\n\nThe reform also proposes to introduce an override clause, which would allow the Knesset to override any ruling of the Supreme Court. The clause would be triggered if the Knesset passes a law by a two-thirds majority.\n\n**Abolition of \"Unreasonableness\" Grounds**\n\nThe reform also proposes to abolish the grounds of \"unreasonableness\" as a basis for judicial review. The grounds would be replaced by a more limited set of criteria, such as a violation of the constitution or a breach of human rights.\n\n### Arguments in Favor of the Reform\n\nProponents of the reform argue that the grounds of \"unreasonableness\" are too broad and too subjective, and that they create uncertainty and unpredictability in the legal system. They claim that the proposed reforms will create a more predictable and more efficient system.\n\n### Arguments Against the Reform\n\nOpponents of the reform argue that the grounds of \"unreasonableness\" are a vital part of the judicial system, and that they provide a check on the power of the elected branches. They claim that the proposed reforms will create a system that is more arbitrary and more subject to the whims of the government and the Minister of Justice.\n\n**Status of the Attorney-General**\n\nThe 2023 judicial reform also proposes to give the Attorney-General greater powers and greater autonomy. The Attorney-General would be responsible for advising the government on legal matters, and would have the power to make decisions on behalf of the government.\n\n**Reactions**\n\nThe 2023 judicial reform has sparked a range of reactions and responses from various groups and individuals.\n\n**National**\n\nThe reform has been widely criticized by opposition parties and civil society organizations, who have accused the government of attempting to undermine the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law. The reform has also been opposed by some members of the judiciary, who have expressed concerns about the impact of the reform on the legitimacy and credibility of the court.\n\n**International**\n\nThe reform has been widely criticized by international organizations and governments, who have expressed concerns about the impact of the reform on the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary. The reform has been condemned by the European Union, the United Nations, and the United States, among others.\n\n**Connection to the Israeli–Palestinian Conflict**\n\nThe 2023 judicial reform has also been linked to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, with some arguing that the reform is part of a broader effort by the Israeli government to undermine the rights and interests of the Palestinian people.\n\n**Suspension and Overruling**\n\nIn 2023, the Supreme Court suspended the 2023 judicial reform, citing concerns about the impact of the reform on the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary. However, the Knesset later overturned the court's ruling, and the reform was implemented.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Israeli Supreme Court\n* Judicial review\n* Rule of law\n* Independence of the judiciary\n* Israeli–Palestinian conflict\n\n**References**\n\n(Note: This article does not include any citations or references.)\n\n**External Links**\n\n* Israeli Ministry of Justice\n* Supreme Court of Israel\n* Movement for Quality Government in Israel\n* European Union\n* United Nations\n* United States Department of State", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The country's strict dress code, known as hijab, is enforced by the morality police, which is responsible for arresting women who do not wear the hijab properly. Women who are arrested by the morality police are often subjected to physical and psychological abuse, and may be imprisoned for periods of up to several months.\n\n### Protest movements under the Islamic Republic\n\nIran has a long history of protest movements, including the 2009 Green Movement, which was sparked by allegations of electoral fraud and was brutally suppressed by the government. The 2019-2020 protests, which were sparked by a hike in fuel prices, were also violently suppressed by the government. Despite the risks, protests have continued to take place in Iran, often sparked by issues such as economic hardship, corruption, and human rights abuses.\n\n### Mahsa Amini's arrest and death in custody\n\nMahsa Amini was arrested by the morality police in Tehran on September 13, 2022, for allegedly not wearing the hijab properly. She was taken to a police station, where she was subjected to physical and psychological abuse, including beatings and insults. Amini was then transferred to a hospital, where she died on September 16, 2022, after falling into a coma. The cause of her death was disputed, with her family claiming that she had been beaten to death, while the government claimed that she had died of a heart attack.\n\n**Protests**\n\n### Slogans and grievances\n\nThe protests that began in Iran in September 2022 were sparked by Amini's death in custody, but quickly grew into a broader movement against the government's human rights abuses, economic policies, and corruption. Protesters chanted slogans such as \"Women, Life, Freedom\" and \"Death to the Dictator,\" and called for the resignation of the government and the establishment of a democratic system.\n\n### Iranian public opinion\n\nPublic opinion in Iran was divided over the protests, with some people expressing support for the protesters and others condemning them as \"rioters.\" However, many Iranians, including women, expressed outrage over Amini's death in custody and called for greater freedoms and human rights.\n\n### Protest techniques\n\nProtesters used a variety of techniques, including street protests, sit-ins, and online activism, to express their grievances and demand change. Some protesters also used social media to spread information and coordinate their activities.\n\n### Civil boycotts\n\nSome Iranian citizens, including shopkeepers and business owners, participated in civil boycotts, refusing to sell goods to government supporters and calling for the government to resign.\n\n### Media Western coverage\n\nThe protests received widespread coverage in Western media, including CNN, BBC, and The New York Times, which highlighted the government's human rights abuses and the bravery of the protesters.\n\n**Casualties, government response**\n\n### Casualties\n\nThe protests were marked by violence, with both protesters and government supporters using deadly force. According to reports, at least 50 people were killed and hundreds were injured during the protests.\n\n### Government casualties\n\nThe government reported that several of its officials and security forces we", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

This article explores the history of women's cinema, its impact on society, and its evolution across various regions and cultures.\n\n**Famous Women in Film History**\n\nThroughout the history of cinema, there have been numerous women who have made significant contributions to the industry. Some of the most famous women in film history include:\n\n### **Silent Films**\n\nDuring the silent era, women played a crucial role in the development of cinema. One of the most iconic women of this era was **Alice Guy-Blaché**, a French filmmaker who directed over 700 films between 1896 and 1920. Another notable woman was **Lois Weber**, an American filmmaker who directed and wrote many films, including the influential 1916 film \"Shoes.\" These women not only broke down barriers for women in film but also paved the way for future generations of female filmmakers.\n\n### **Classical Hollywood**\n\nIn the classical Hollywood era, women continued to play a vital role in the industry. **Irene Dunne**, a popular actress, was also a skilled producer and writer. **Ida Lupino**, a British-American actress and director, was one of the first women to direct films in Hollywood. Her 1949 film \"The Hitch-Hiker\" was a groundbreaking thriller that showcased her unique visual style and narrative approach.\n\n### **Experimental and Avant-Garde Cinema**\n\nIn the mid-20th century, women began to experiment with avant-garde and experimental cinema. **Maya Deren**, a Bulgarian-American filmmaker, was a key figure in this movement. Her 1943 film \"Meshes of the Afternoon\" was a pioneering work of avant-garde cinema that explored the relationship between time and space. **Carolee Schneemann**, an American artist and filmmaker, was another influential woman in this movement. Her 1964 film \"Meat Joy\" was a provocative exploration of the relationship between the body and nature.\n\n**Impact on Society**\n\nWomen's cinema has had a significant impact on society, reflecting and shaping the experiences and perspectives of women. Some of the key areas where women's cinema has had an impact include:\n\n### **Impact of Second-Wave Feminism**\n\nThe second-wave feminist movement of the 1960s and 1970s had a profound impact on women's cinema. Films such as **Martha Coolidge's** 1978 film \"Valentine\" and **Barbara Loden's** 1970 film \"Wanda\" reflected the changing attitudes towards women's roles in society. These films explored themes of female empowerment, identity, and social justice.\n\n### **Representing Sexuality**\n\nWomen's cinema has often explored themes of sexuality and the body. Films such as **Jane Campion's** 1993 film \"The Piano\" and **Pedro Almodóvar's** 1999 film \"All About My Mother\" showcased the complexities and nuances of female desire. These films challenged traditional representations of women and sex, offering more nuanced and empowering portrayals.\n\n### **Fear of Entering Cinematography**\n\nDespite the many achievements of women in film, there are still significant barriers to women entering cinematography. According to a 2020 report, women make up only 20% of cinematographers in the film industry. This lack of representation and opportunity has led to a dearth of female perspectives in cinema.\n\n### **Statistics**\n\nThe lack of representation of women in film is reflected in the statistics. According to a 2020 report, women make up only 21% of directors, 22% of producers, and 32% of writers in the film industry. These numbers highlight the significant barriers to women's participation in film.\n\n### **Documentaries**\n\nDocumentaries have been an essential part of women's cinema, offering a platform for women's voices and experiences. **Shirin Neshat's** 2005 documentary \"Looking for Oum Kulthum\" was a powerful exploration of the life and legacy of the famous Egyptian singer. **Julie Dash's** 1991 documentary \"Daughters of the Dust\" was a groundbreaking work that explored the lives of African American women.\n\n### **Female Filmmakers as Feminists**\n\nMany women filmmakers have used their work to explore and challenge feminist ideals. **Lynne Ramsay's** 2002 film \"Morvern Callar\" was a powerful exploration of female identity and desire. **Agnès Varda's** 1962 film \"Cléo from 5 to 7\" was a pioneering work of feminist cinema that explored the relationship between the body and politics.\n\n### **Celluloid Ceiling**\n\nThe concept of the \"celluloid ceiling\" refers to the lack of opportunities and representation for women in film. According to a 2020 report, women make up only 24% of the top 100 grossing films of 2019. This lack of representation and opportunity has led to a dearth of female perspectives in cinema.\n\n**North America**\n\nWomen's cinema in North America has a rich and diverse history.

The collapse had far-reaching consequences, affecting customers, shareholders, and the broader financial system. This article provides an in-depth examination of the events leading up to the collapse, the impact of the collapse, and the reactions of various stakeholders.\n\n**Background**\n\nSilicon Valley Bank was founded in 1983 and was headquartered in Santa Clara, California. The bank focused on providing financial services to the technology and venture capital industries, earning it a reputation as a leading financial institution in the region. Over the years, the bank expanded its operations, opening branches in several states and offering a range of financial products and services. By 2023, Silicon Valley Bank had grown to become one of the largest banks in the United States, with over $200 billion in assets.\n\n**Collapse**\n\nThe collapse of Silicon Valley Bank began in early 2023, when the bank's financial situation began to deteriorate. The bank had invested heavily in the technology industry, which had experienced a downturn in 2022. As a result, the bank's assets had declined in value, leaving it with significant losses. The bank's management attempted to address the issue by raising capital and reducing expenses, but the efforts were unsuccessful.\n\n**Losses**\n\nThe bank's losses were significant, totaling over $10 billion in 2022 alone. The losses were attributed to a combination of factors, including the decline in technology stocks, the rise of interest rates, and the bank's aggressive lending practices. The bank's management had invested heavily in the technology industry, hoping to capitalize on the sector's growth. However, the downturn in the industry had left the bank with significant losses.\n\n**Instability**\n\nThe bank's financial situation became increasingly unstable as the year progressed. The bank's management attempted to address the issue by raising capital and reducing expenses, but the efforts were unsuccessful. The bank's stock price began to decline, and the bank's credit rating was downgraded. The bank's customers began to withdraw their funds, fearing that the bank was on the brink of collapse.\n\n**Receivership**\n\nIn March 2023, the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) placed Silicon Valley Bank under receivership. The bank's assets were seized, and the DFPI took control of the bank's operations. The move was intended to protect the bank's customers and prevent a wider collapse of the financial system.\n\n**Acquisition**\n\nIn the days following the bank's collapse, several financial institutions expressed interest in acquiring the bank's assets. The FDIC, which had taken over the bank's operations, solicited bids from several interested parties. In the end, the bank's assets were acquired by a consortium of investors, led by First Republic Bank. The acquisition was intended to preserve the bank's assets and prevent a wider collapse of the financial system.\n\n**Effects**\n\nThe collapse of Silicon Valley Bank had far-reaching consequences, affecting customers, shareholders, and the broader financial system.\n\n**Customers**\n\nThe collapse of the bank had a significant impact on its customers. The bank's customers were left without access to their funds, and many were forced to seek alternative banking arrangements. The collapse also had a negative impact on small businesses and entrepreneurs, who relied on the bank for financial services.\n\n**Shareholders**\n\nThe collapse of the bank had a significant impact on its shareholders. The bank's stock price declined significantly, and many shareholders lost a significant portion of their investment.\n\n**Financial system**\n\nThe collapse of the bank had a significant impact on the broader financial system. The bank's failure raised concerns about the stability of the financial system and the potential for a wider collapse.\n\n**Legal actions**\n\nThe collapse of the bank also raised several legal concerns. The bank's management was accused of reckless lending practices and failure to disclose the bank's financial situation to regulators. Several lawsuits were filed against the bank's management, alleging that they had engaged in insider trading and other forms of financial misconduct.\n\n**Reactions**\n\nThe collapse of Silicon Valley Bank raised a range of reactions from various stakeholders.\n\n**Official responses**\n\nThe collapse of the bank was met with official responses from regulators and government agencies. The FDIC and the OCC praised the bank's management for their efforts to address the bank's financial situation, but acknowledged that the efforts were ultimately unsuccessful.\n\n**Debate over government intervention**\n\nThe collapse of the bank raised questions about the role of government intervention in the financial system. Some argued that the government should have intervened earlier to prevent the bank's collapse, while others argued that the government's efforts were sufficient.\n\n**Debate about causes**\n\nThe collapse of the bank also raised questions about the causes of the bank's failure. Some argued that the bank's management was responsible for the bank's collapse, while others argued that the bank's failure was due to external factors, such as the decline in technology stocks.\n\n**See also**\n\n* List of largest bank failures in the United States\n* Silicon Valley Bank\n* FDIC\n* OCC\n* California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation\n* First Republic Bank", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

With a storied career spanning over three decades, Harding has participated in numerous expeditions and ventures that have taken him to the farthest reaches of the globe, from the depths of the ocean to the highest mountains.\n\n**Early life and education**\n\nHamish Harding was born in 1958 in the United Kingdom. Little is known about his early life, but it is reported that he developed an early interest in exploration and adventure. Harding attended the University of London, where he studied economics and business administration. After completing his education, Harding worked for several years in the financial sector before becoming involved in the world of exploration and adventure.\n\n**Career and adventures**\n\nHarding's career as an explorer and adventurer began in the early 1990s, when he joined the team of Sir Ranulph Fiennes, a renowned British explorer, on an expedition to the North Pole. Harding's experience on this expedition marked the beginning of a long and distinguished career in exploration, during which he would go on to participate in numerous expeditions and adventures around the world.\n\nHarding's early career was marked by a series of high-profile expeditions, including a 1993 attempt to reach the summit of Mount Everest via the North Ridge. Although this expedition was unsuccessful, Harding's experience and skills as a mountaineer and explorer were soon in high demand, and he went on to participate in a number of other expeditions, including a 1995 expedition to the South Pole.\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, Harding became increasingly involved in the world of deep-sea exploration, participating in several high-profile expeditions to the ocean floor. In 2002, Harding joined the team of filmmaker James Cameron on an expedition to the wreck of the Titanic, which would later prove to be one of the most significant expeditions of his career.\n\n**Titan expedition and death**\n\nIn 2022, Harding joined the team of filmmaker James Cameron on a deep-sea submersible expedition to the wreck of the Titanic. The expedition, which aimed to explore the wreck of the ship in unprecedented detail, was conducted using a state-of-the-art submersible vessel capable of reaching depths of over 12,000 meters.\n\nOn July 18, 2022, Harding and his fellow expedition members, including Paul-Henri Nargeolet, a French deep-sea explorer, and Shahzada Dawood, a British businessman, prepared to dive to the wreck of the Titanic in the submersible vessel. However, during the dive, the vessel experienced a catastrophic failure, resulting in the loss of all three lives.\n\nThe incident was widely reported in the media, and an investigation was launched to determine the cause of the accident. The incident marked a tragic end to Harding's illustrious career as an explorer and adventurer.\n\n**Personal life**\n\nLittle is known about Hamish Harding's personal life, and he is said to have kept his family life private. However, it is reported that he was married with children and was known to be close to his family.\n\n**Awards and recognition**\n\nThroughout his career, Hamish Harding received numerous awards and recognition for his contributions to exploration and adventure. He was a member of the Royal Geographical Society and the Explorers Club, and was awarded several honors for his services to exploration and conservation.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Sir Ranulph Fiennes\n* James Cameron\n* Titanic\n* Deep-sea exploration\n* Mount Everest\n\n**References**\n\n(Note: This article does not include any citations or references, as per the requirements)\n\n**External links**\n\n* Hamish Harding's website\n* Hamish Harding on Twitter\n* Hamish Harding on LinkedIn", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The blockade began in 1989 and has continued to the present day, with periods of increased tension and violence.\n\nBackground\n\n### First blockade (1989–2023) and isolation from Armenia (1989–1992)\n\nThe first blockade of Nagorno-Karabakh was initiated by Azerbaijan in 1989, following the Karabakh movement, a nationalist movement advocating for the unification of Nagorno-Karabakh with Armenia. The blockade was aimed at cutting off the region from Armenia, which was then part of the Soviet Union. The blockade resulted in the isolation of Nagorno-Karabakh from Armenia, leading to severe humanitarian and economic consequences for the region's population.\n\n### Threats to public utility infrastructure and entry\n\nThroughout the blockade, there have been repeated threats to the public utility infrastructure and entry points to Nagorno-Karabakh. These threats have resulted in the destruction of critical infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and power lines. The blockade has also made it increasingly difficult for humanitarian aid to reach the region, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis.\n\n### Prelude\n\nIn recent years, tensions between Armenia and Azerbaijan have escalated, with repeated clashes along the Line of Contact, the de facto border between the two countries. The escalation of tensions has resulted in increased humanitarian needs, including food, medicine, and shelter.\n\nBlockade timeline\n\n### 2022 events\n\nIn 2022, the blockade of Nagorno-Karabakh reached a critical point, with repeated attempts by Azerbaijan to cut off the region's access to Armenia. The blockade resulted in severe shortages of food, medicine, and other essential supplies, leading to widespread hunger and malnutrition among the population.\n\n### 2023 events\n\nIn 2023, the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh continued to deteriorate, with repeated reports of violence and destruction along the Line of Contact. The blockade remained in place, with Azerbaijan continuing to restrict access to the region.\n\nHumanitarian crisis\n\n### Lack of access to supplies and medical care\n\nThe blockade of Nagorno-Karabakh has resulted in a severe humanitarian crisis, with widespread shortages of food, medicine, and other essential supplies. The region's population has been left without access to basic necessities, including healthcare, leading to a significant increase in mortality rates.\n\n### Limited supplies transported by the Red Cross and the Russian peacekeepers\n\nDespite the efforts of the Red Cross and the Russian peacekeepers to transport supplies into the region, the blockade has remained in place, severely limiting the amount of aid that can reach the population. The limited supplies have been insufficient to meet the needs of the population, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis.\n\nDamage to infrastructure\n\nThe blockade has resulted in significant damage to the infrastructure of Nagorno-Karabakh, including roads, bridges, and power lines. The destruction of critical infrastructure has made it increasingly difficult for the population to access basic necessities, including food, water, and healthcare.\n\nGenocide risk factors\n\nThe blockade of Nagorno-Karabakh has resulted in significant humanitarian needs, including food, medicine, and shelter. The prolonged blockade has led to a significant increase in mortality rates, with widespread hunger and malnutrition among the population. The humanitarian crisis has been exacerbated by the destruction of critical infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and power lines.\n\nInaction of the Russian peacekeepers\n\nThe Russian peacekeepers have been deployed in Nagorno-Karabakh since 2020, but have failed to effectively address the humanitarian crisis. The peacekeepers have been criticized for their inaction, which has allowed the blockade to continue, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis.\n\nProposed solutions\n\nSeveral proposed solutions have been put forward to address the humanitarian crisis in Nagorno-Karabakh, including the establishment of a humanitarian corridor to facilitate the delivery of aid. However, these proposals have been met with resistance from Azerbaijan, which has continued to restrict access to the region.\n\nAuthenticity of the environmental activism claims\n\nThe blockade of Nagorno-Karabakh has been justified by Azerbaijan as a response to environmental concerns, including the alleged pollution of the region's air and water. However, the authenticity of these claims has been questioned by many, including independent journalists and NGOs.\n\n### Involvement of the Azerbaijani government\n\nThe Azerbaijani government has been accused of fabricating the environmental concerns as a pretext for the blockade. The government has been criticized for its handling of the humanitarian crisis, including its failure to provide adequate aid to the population.\n\n### Involvement of state employees and civil servants\n\nState employees and civil servants have been accused of being involved in the blockade, including the destruction of critical infrastructure. The involvement of government officials has been criticized as a clear indication of the Azerbaijani government's intention to exacerbate the humanitarian crisis.\n\n### Inaccessibility of Nagorno-Karabakh to the public and independent journalists\n\nThe blockade has made it increasingly difficult for the public and independent journalists to access Nagorno-Karabakh, making it impossible to verify the claims of environmental concerns. The inaccessibility of the region has been criticized as a clear indication of the Azerbaijani government's intention to conceal the true extent of the humanitarian crisis.\n\n### Scrutiny of the \"protesters\" and their alleged environmental concerns\n\nThe \"protesters\" who have been involved in the blockade have been criticized for their lack of transparency and accountability. The scrutiny of the protesters and their alleged environmental concerns has been met with resistance from the Azerbaijani government, which has continued to restrict access to the region.\n\nLawsuits\n\n### International Court of Justice\n\nSeveral lawsuits have been filed at the International Court of Justice, including a case brought by Armenia against Azerbaijan for the blockade of Nagorno-Karabakh.\n\n### European Court of Human Rights\n\nSeveral cases have been brought to the European Court of Human Rights, including a case brought by the residents of Nagorno-Karabakh against Azerbaijan for the destruction of their homes and the blockade of the region.\n\nReactions\n\n### Involved parties\n\nThe blockade of Nagorno-Karabakh has been met with widespread condemnation from the international community, including the United Nations, the European Union, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.\n\n### International\n\nThe international community has been critical of the Azerbaijani government's handling of the humanitarian crisis, including its failure to provide adequate aid to the population.\n\n### Supranational\n\nThe supranational organizations, including the European Union and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, have been critical of the Azerbaijani government's handling of the humanitarian crisis.\n\n### Non-governmental organizations\n\nSeveral non-governmental organizations, including the Red Cross and the Human Rights Watch, have been critical of the Azerbaijani government's handling of the humanitarian crisis.\n\nSee also\n\n* Nagorno-Karabakh conflict\n* Azerbaijan–Armenia relations\n* Humanitarian crisis in Nagorno-Karabakh\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nWorks cited\n\n* \"Nagorno-Karabakh Conflict\".

It is the largest land carnivore and one of the most iconic and well-studied species in the animal kingdom. Polar bears are known for their distinctive white coats and impressive physical characteristics, which enable them to thrive in the harsh Arctic environment.\n\nNaming\n--------\n\nThe polar bear has been referred to by various names throughout history. In Inuit languages, the polar bear is known as \"nanuk\" or \"nanook,\" while in other Arctic cultures, it is referred to as \"bua\" or \"ursus.\" The scientific name \"Ursus maritimus\" was given to the polar bear by Carl Linnaeus in 1758, with \"Ursus\" meaning \"bear\" in Latin and \"maritimus\" meaning \"of the sea.\"\n\nTaxonomy\n---------\n\nPolar bears belong to the family Ursidae and are closely related to other bear species, including the brown bear and the black bear. However, they are distinct from these species due to their unique adaptations to the Arctic environment. The polar bear's closest relative is the spectacled bear, with which it shares a common ancestor dating back to the Pleistocene era.\n\nEvolution\n---------\n\nPolar bears evolved from a common ancestor with other bear species during the late Pliocene era, approximately 2.5 million years ago. As the climate changed and the Arctic environment became more inhospitable, the polar bear's ancestors adapted to the new conditions by developing a thick layer of fat and a white coat to blend in with the snow and ice. Over time, these adaptations allowed polar bears to become specialized predators in the Arctic ecosystem.\n\nCharacteristics\n------------\n\nPolar bears possess several distinctive physical characteristics that enable them to thrive in the Arctic environment. Their white coats are made up of two layers: a thick undercoat and a longer, guard hair layer that reflects sunlight and helps to camouflage them in the snow. Adult polar bears can weigh up to 1,700 pounds (770 kg) and reach lengths of up to 9 feet (2.7 meters), making them the largest land carnivores on Earth.\n\nDistribution and Habitat\n----------------------\n\nPolar bears are found in the Arctic Circle, including Alaska, Canada, Greenland, and Norway. They inhabit areas with sea ice, where they hunt for prey and breed. As the climate changes, polar bears are forced to adapt to new habitats, including land and freshwater environments. However, these areas are often limited and fragmented, leading to conflicts between polar bears and humans.\n\nBehaviour and Ecology\n-------------------\n\n### Social Life\n\nPolar bears are generally solitary animals, only coming together for mating or when there is a food source. Female polar bears often give birth to twins, but the cubs will often remain with their mother for several years, learning essential survival skills. Polar bears have been observed showing signs of playfulness and curiosity, particularly in younger individuals.\n\n### Diet and Hunting\n\nPolar bears are carnivorous mammals, primarily feeding on ringed seals and other marine mammals. They have an excellent sense of smell, which helps them detect prey in the snow and ice. In the summer months, when sea ice is scarce, polar bears will hunt for other prey, including fish and birds.\n\n### Reproduction and Development\n\nFemale polar bears typically give birth to two cubs, which are blind and toothless at birth. The cubs will nurse for several months, during which time they will learn essential survival skills from their mother. Polar bears reach reproductive maturity at around 4-5 years of age, although this can vary depending on various factors.\n\n### Mortality\n\nPolar bears face various mortality threats, including starvation, drowning, and human-caused mortality. Climate change is also a significant threat, as it reduces the availability of sea ice and forces polar bears to adapt to new habitats. According to estimates, up to 30% of polar bears may die due to climate change by 2050.\n\nConservation Status\n-----------------\n\nThe polar bear is listed as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), with estimates suggesting that there are around 22,000-31,000 individuals remaining in the wild. The main threats to polar bears are climate change, habitat loss, and human-caused mortality.\n\nRelationship with Humans\n----------------------\n\n### Exploitation\n\nPolar bears have been hunted for their meat, fur, and other body parts, including their skin and teeth. This has led to significant declines in polar bear populations, particularly in the 19th and 20th centuries. However, hunting regulations have been implemented to protect polar bears and their habitats.\n\n### Conflicts\n\nPolar bears and humans often come into conflict, particularly in areas where their habitats overlap. This can lead to property damage, injuries, and fatalities, as well as stress and anxiety for both humans and polar bears.\n\n### Captivity\n\nPolar bears are often kept in captivity for scientific research, conservation efforts, and entertainment purposes. However, this can be a stressful and unnatural environment for the animals, and many organizations are working to phase out captivity and promote more humane alternatives.\n\n### Cultural Significance\n\nPolar bears have significant cultural and symbolic importance in many Arctic communities, where they are often revered as a symbol of strength, resilience, and adaptation. They are also an important part of Arctic folklore, appearing in stories and legends as a powerful and mysterious creature.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Ursidae\n* Polar bear habitat\n* Climate change and polar bears\n* Polar bear conservation\n* Polar bear hunting\n\nNotes\n------\n\n* The polar bear is also known as the \"sea bear\" or \"ice bear.\"\n* Polar bears are excellent swimmers, with some individuals recorded swimming for up to 60 miles (97 km) without rest.\n* The polar bear's sense of smell is estimated to be up to 7 times more sensitive than that of a bloodhound.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n* Linnaeus, C.
