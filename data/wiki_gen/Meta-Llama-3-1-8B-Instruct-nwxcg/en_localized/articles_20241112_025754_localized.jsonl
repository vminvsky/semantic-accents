It was one of the most significant empires in Southeast Asian history, known for its rich culture, impressive architecture, and complex system of government. This article provides an overview of the kingdom's history, government, culture, and economy, as well as its significance in the broader context of Southeast Asian history.\n\n**History**\n\n### Origins\n\nThe Ayutthaya Kingdom was founded by Ramathibodi I, a leader of the Mon people who had migrated from the region of Dvaravati in present-day Cambodia. Prior to the establishment of Ayutthaya, the region was home to several smaller city-states, including Sukhothai and Lanna. These cities were influenced by Indian culture and Buddhism, which would later become the dominant religions of the kingdom.\n\n#### Pre-Ayutthaya Cities\n\nThe city of Ayutthaya was likely founded on the site of an earlier city called Ayodhaya, which was mentioned in the ancient Indian epic, the Ramayana. The site was strategically located at the confluence of the Chao Phraya and Lopburi rivers, making it an ideal place for trade and commerce.\n\n#### The Traditional Founding of Ayutthaya\n\nThe traditional founding of Ayutthaya is attributed to Ramathibodi I, who is said to have established the city in 1350. According to legend, Ramathibodi I was a wise and just ruler who brought peace and prosperity to the region. He established a system of government based on the principles of Buddhism and the Hindu caste system.\n\n### Early Maritime Dominance\n\nDuring the 14th and 15th centuries, Ayutthaya became a major maritime power in Southeast Asia. The kingdom established trade relationships with China, India, and other neighboring states, and its merchants played a significant role in the regional trade network. The kingdom's naval power was also used to protect its trade interests and to expand its territorial control.\n\n### Age of Warfare\n\nIn the 16th century, Ayutthaya entered a period of warfare with its neighbors, including the Kingdom of Lan Xang (present-day Laos) and the Burmese Empire. The kingdom's military forces were largely composed of infantry and cavalry, and its military tactics were influenced by Indian and Chinese warfare traditions.\n\n#### Transition to a Hinterland State\n\nDuring the 17th century, Ayutthaya began to transition from a maritime to a hinterland state. The kingdom's trade relationships with China and India began to decline, and its focus shifted to internal development and expansion. The kingdom's military forces were reorganized to focus on defensive operations, and its administrative system was reformed to improve efficiency and effectiveness.\n\n#### Centralization and Dominance of the Northern Lords\n\nIn the late 17th century, the kingdom underwent a period of centralization, during which the power of the northern lords was reduced. The king's authority was strengthened, and the kingdom's administrative system was reformed to improve its efficiency and effectiveness.\n\n#### First Burmese Wars\n\nAyutthaya's relations with the Burmese Empire deteriorated in the early 18th century, leading to a series of conflicts known as the First Burmese Wars. The wars were fought over issues of territorial control and trade, and they had a significant impact on the kingdom's development.\n\n### Peace and Commerce\n\nIn the late 18th century, Ayutthaya entered a period of peace and commerce. The kingdom's trade relationships with China and India were reestablished, and its merchants played a significant role in the regional trade network. The kingdom's economy began to diversify, and its agricultural production increased.\n\n#### Later Phitsanulok Dynasty to Early Prasat Thong Dynasty\n\nDuring this period, the kingdom was ruled by the Phitsanulok dynasty, which was known for its wise and just rulers. The kingdom's administrative system was reformed to improve its efficiency and effectiveness, and its trade relationships with neighboring states were strengthened.\n\n#### Persian and French Influences\n\nThe kingdom's culture was also influenced by Persian and French traditions. The kingdom's architecture, art, and literature were influenced by these foreign cultures, and its people adopted many of their customs and practices.\n\n### Late Ayutthaya Period\n\nIn the late 18th century, Ayutthaya entered a period of decline. The kingdom's economy began to stagnate, and its military forces were weakened. The kingdom's relations with its neighbors deteriorated, and it was eventually conquered by the Burmese Empire in 1767.\n\n#### Continued Prosperity and Increased Chinese Connections\n\nDespite its decline, Ayutthaya continued to prosper. The kingdom's trade relationships with China increased, and its merchants played a significant role in the regional trade network. The kingdom's economy began to diversify, and its agricultural production increased.\n\n#### Succession Conflicts and Corruption\n\nThe kingdom's succession conflicts and corruption weakened its power and effectiveness. The kingdom's administrative system was inefficient, and its military forces were poorly organized. The kingdom's relations with its neighbors deteriorated, and it was eventually conquered by the Burmese Empire.\n\n#### Introduction of Capitalism, Rise of Commoners, and Proto-Nationalism\n\nDuring this period, Ayutthaya introduced capitalism and the rise of commoners. The kingdom's economy began to diversify, and its agricultural production increased. The kingdom's culture was also influenced by proto-nationalist ideals, which emphasized the importance of a unified Thai identity.\n\n#### Nobility and Buddhism\n\nThe kingdom's nobility and Buddhism played a significant role in its development. The kingdom's nobles were influential in the kingdom's politics and economy, and Buddhism was the dominant religion of the kingdom. The kingdom's Buddhist practices and traditions were influential in the development of Thai culture.\n\n### Military and Political Situation to 1759\n\nIn the late 18th century, Ayutthaya's military and political situation was precarious. The kingdom's military forces were weakened, and its relations with its neighbors deteriorated. The kingdom's administrative system was inefficient, and its economy was stagnant.\n\n### Fall of Ayutthaya\n\nIn 1759, Ayutthaya was conquered by the Burmese Empire. The kingdom's capital city was destroyed, and its people were forced to flee. The kingdom's culture and traditions were preserved, but its development was significantly impacted by the conquest.\n\n#### Aftermath\n\nThe aftermath of the conquest was significant. The kingdom's people were forced to adapt to their new circumstances, and the kingdom's culture was influenced by the Burmese Empire. The kingdom's economy was severely impacted, and its trade relationships were disrupted.\n\n**Government**\n\n### Kings\n\nAyutthaya's kings played a significant role in its development. The kingdom's kings were influential in the kingdom's politics and economy, and they were responsible for its military and administrative systems. The kingdom's kings were also responsible for its cultural and religious traditions.\n\n### Mandalas System\n\nAyutthaya's mandalas system was a complex system of administration that was used to govern the kingdom. The system was based on a network of provinces, each of which was governed by a governor.

The film was primarily shot in Hyderabad, with some scenes filmed in other locations in Telangana.\n\n#### Legal issues\n\nIn 2021, the film's production was halted due to a legal dispute between the film's producers and a local temple. The temple's management had objected to the film's shooting in their premises, citing concerns over the film's content. However, the dispute was eventually resolved, and the film's shooting resumed.\n\n**Music**\n\nThe film's music was composed by Mani Sharma, who had previously collaborated with Chiranjeevi on several films.

The conflict has led to significant human rights violations, economic disruption, and a deterioration of relations between Russia and the international community.\n\nBackground\n\n### Independent Ukraine and the Orange Revolution\n\nIn 1991, Ukraine gained independence from the Soviet Union, and in 2004, the country experienced a major turning point with the Orange Revolution. This revolution was a peaceful protest movement that brought an end to the presidential election that had been widely seen as rigged. The movement ultimately led to the installation of Viktor Yushchenko as president, who had been a key figure in the opposition.\n\n### Euromaidan, Revolution of Dignity, and pro-Russian unrest\n\nIn 2013, Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych faced increasing pressure to sign an association agreement with the European Union. However, he ultimately decided to suspend the agreement, citing concerns about economic ties with Russia. This decision led to widespread protests in the capital city of Kiev, which became known as the Euromaidan movement. The protests continued for months and ultimately led to the ousting of Yanukovych in February 2014.\n\n### Russian military bases in Crimea\n\nPrior to the annexation of Crimea, Russia had maintained a significant military presence in the region. In 2014, Russia had a total of 16 military bases in Crimea, including the Sevastopol naval base. These bases played a significant role in Russia's decision to annex the region.\n\n### Legality and declaration of war\n\nThe annexation of Crimea by Russia was widely condemned by the international community, with many countries viewing the move as a violation of international law. The Russian government argued that Crimea had historically been part of Russia and that the annexation was a matter of self-determination. However, the Ukrainian government and many other countries disputed this claim, arguing that Crimea had been part of Ukraine since 1954 and that the annexation was a clear act of aggression.\n\nHistory\n\n### Russian annexation of Crimea (2014)\n\nOn February 27, 2014, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that Russia would hold a referendum on the status of Crimea. The referendum was widely seen as a sham, with many opposition leaders and international observers barred from participating. On March 16, 2014, the referendum was held, and the majority of voters supported joining Russia. The annexation was widely condemned by the international community, with the United States and the European Union imposing economic sanctions on Russia in response.\n\n### War in the Donbas (2014–2015)\n\nIn April 2014, pro-Russia unrest broke out in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. The unrest was characterized by clashes between Ukrainian government forces and pro-Russian separatists. The conflict escalated in May 2014, with the separatists declaring the establishment of the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic. The conflict continued to escalate throughout 2014 and 2015, with both sides suffering significant losses.\n\n### Pro-Russia unrest\n\nThe pro-Russia unrest in the Donbas region was characterized by a range of violent and non-violent tactics. Pro-Russian separatists used tactics such as kidnapping, torture, and murder to intimidate and control the local population. The Ukrainian government responded with force, using troops and artillery to try and quell the unrest.\n\n### Armed conflict\n\nThe conflict in the Donbas region was marked by significant armed clashes between Ukrainian government forces and pro-Russian separatists. The clashes were often intense and resulted in significant losses on both sides. The conflict also resulted in the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people, who were forced to flee their homes due to the violence.\n\n### August 2014 Russian invasion\n\nIn August 2014, Russia launched a major military invasion of Ukraine. The invasion was characterized by a significant buildup of Russian troops along the border, followed by a series of artillery attacks on Ukrainian government positions. The invasion marked a significant escalation of the conflict and resulted in the deaths of hundreds of people.\n\n### Mariupol offensive and first Minsk ceasefire\n\nIn January 2015, Ukrainian government forces launched a major offensive against the separatists in the city of Mariupol. The offensive was successful, and the separatists were forced to retreat. The conflict resulted in the deaths of hundreds of people and the displacement of thousands.\n\n### End of 2014 and Minsk II agreement\n\nIn December 2014, the Ukrainian government and the separatists signed the Minsk II agreement, which aimed to bring an end to the conflict. The agreement established a ceasefire and provided for the exchange of prisoners and the withdrawal of heavy weapons. However, the agreement ultimately failed to bring an end to the conflict, and fighting continued throughout 2015 and 2016.\n\nLine of conflict stabilizes (2015–2022)\n\n### 2018 Kerch Strait incident\n\nIn November 2018, a significant escalation of the conflict occurred when Russia seized three Ukrainian naval vessels in the Kerch Strait. The incident resulted in the deaths of several Ukrainian sailors and the detention of 24 Ukrainian crew members. The incident marked a significant escalation of the conflict and resulted in the imposition of further economic sanctions on Russia by the United States and the European Union.\n\n### 2019–2020\n\nIn 2019 and 2020, the conflict continued to simmer, with both sides suffering significant losses.

The storm was a significant weather event that caused widespread damage and disruption to communities.\n\n## #Meteorological history\n\nTropical Storm Megi formed on April 6, 2022, in the western Pacific Ocean, roughly 500 miles (800 km) southeast of Guam. At the time, the storm was a tropical disturbance that had been monitored by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) for several days. As the system organized, it began to produce tropical storm-force winds and a closed circulation was noted by satellite imagery.\n\nThe JTWC classified the system as Tropical Storm Megi at 12:00 UTC on April 6, with sustained winds of 45 mph (75 km/h) and a central pressure of 1006 mbar. Over the next 24 hours, the storm intensified further, with winds increasing to 60 mph (95 km/h) and a pressure of 998 mbar.\n\nMegi continued to move northwestward, parallel to the coast of the Philippines, where it was expected to bring heavy rainfall and strong winds. By April 8, the storm had intensified to 70 mph (110 km/h) and a pressure of 994 mbar, with a well-defined eye at the center.\n\n## #Preparations\n\nAs Tropical Storm Megi approached the Philippines, the government and disaster management agencies took proactive measures to prepare for the storm's impact. The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) issued a warning for the storm, urging residents in affected areas to take necessary precautions.\n\nEvacuation centers were set up in several provinces, and rescue teams were put on standby. The Philippine Coast Guard and the Philippine Navy were also deployed to assist in evacuation and search and rescue operations.\n\nIn addition, the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) conducted a pre-storm inspection of critical infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and water supply systems. The DPWH also mobilized personnel and equipment to respond to any damage caused by the storm.\n\n## #Impact\n\nTropical Storm Megi made landfall in the province of Aurora, Philippines on the morning of April 9, with sustained winds of 75 mph (120 km/h) and a central pressure of 996 mbar. The storm brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to the affected areas, causing widespread damage and disruption.\n\nThe storm surge caused by Megi inundated coastal communities, affecting thousands of residents. The storm also caused landslides and flooding, especially in areas with heavy rainfall.\n\nAccording to the NDRRMC, at least 50 people were killed and over 100 injured in the storm. The storm also caused significant damage to infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and buildings.\n\nIn addition, the storm affected several provinces in the Philippines, including Isabela, Quirino, and Nueva Vizcaya. The storm also affected the island of Guam, where strong winds and heavy rainfall caused power outages and damage to infrastructure.\n\n## #Aftermath\n\nIn the aftermath of Tropical Storm Megi, the government and disaster management agencies worked to respond to the needs of affected communities. The NDRRMC established a command center to coordinate relief efforts, and rescue teams were deployed to affected areas.\n\nThe Philippine Red Cross and other humanitarian organizations also provided assistance to affected communities, including food, shelter, and medical supplies.\n\nIn addition, the government provided financial assistance to affected communities, including cash assistance and low-interest loans. The government also set up a relief package for affected farmers and fishermen.\n\n## #Retirement\n\nTropical Storm Megi was retired from use as a storm name by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) in May 2022, due to the significant damage and loss of life it caused.\n\nThe WMO announced that the name Megi would not be used again for any future tropical cyclones, in order to avoid any potential distress or hardship to communities that may be affected by future storms.\n\n## #See also\n\n* List of tropical cyclones in 2022\n* Typhoon season in the Pacific\n* Tropical cyclone formation\n* Storm surge\n* Flood\n* Landslide\n\n## #References\n\n(Note: This section is typically used to cite sources and provide references for the information presented in the article.

The film is set in 1920s Hollywood and follows the lives of various individuals in the film industry during a period of significant change and upheaval.\n\n# Plot\n\nThe film is set in the late 1920s and follows the lives of several individuals in the film industry, including Nellie LaRoy (played by Margot Robbie), a young actress who becomes embroiled in the scandalous world of Hollywood; Jack Conrad (played by Brad Pitt), a fading star of the silent era who is struggling to adapt to the new sound technology; and Manny Torres (played by Diego Calva), a young Mexican-American man who becomes a key figure in the film industry.\n\nAs the story unfolds, the characters become embroiled in a series of scandals, including a wild party that gets out of control, a violent confrontation between rival gangs, and a tragic accident that has far-reaching consequences. Throughout the film, Chazelle explores the corrupt and decadent world of 1920s Hollywood, revealing the seedy underbelly of the film industry and the personal demons that drove its characters.\n\n# Cast\n\n* Margot Robbie as Nellie LaRoy\n* Brad Pitt as Jack Conrad\n* Diego Calva as Manny Torres\n* Jovan Adepo as Sidney Palmer\n* Li Jun Li as Rose Hunsberger\n* Lukas Haas as Irving Thalberg\n* Olivia Hamilton as Katherine Surridge\n* Eric Roberts as E.J. Bedford\n* Jean Smart as Elinor St. John\n* Toby Leonard Moore as Pat Marshall\n* P.J. Byrne as Father Matthew Cassidy\n* Jeffery Wright as William H. \"Billy\" Mitchell\n* Katherine Waterston as Dot (uncredited)\n* Ethan Suplee as Billie (uncredited)\n* Julia Butters as Mary (uncredited)\n* Maya Rudolph as Mona Stevens (uncredited)\n* Flea as Townley Tiplady (uncredited)\n\n# Production\n\n## Development\n\nBabylon was first announced in May 2020, with Damien Chazelle set to write and direct the film. The project was originally intended to be a musical, with Chazelle planning to feature a wide range of original songs. However, the film's scope and tone eventually shifted, and the musical elements were dropped.\n\n## Filming\n\nPrincipal photography for Babylon began in June 2021 at Paramount Studios in Los Angeles. The film was shot on a combination of 35mm film and digital formats, with a crew of over 100 people working on the production. The shoot was notable for its extensive use of practical effects, with many of the film's sets and stunts created on-location.\n\n## Music\n\nThe film's score was composed by Justin Hurwitz, who also collaborated with Chazelle on Whiplash and La La Land. The score features a mix of jazz, blues, and classical music, reflecting the eclectic tastes of the film's characters. However, the score does not feature any original songs, unlike the original plan for the film.\n\n# Themes\n\nBabylon explores a range of themes, including the corrupt and decadent world of 1920s Hollywood, the struggle for artistic expression in the face of commercial pressure, and the personal demons that drove the film's characters. The film also touches on issues of racism, sexism, and classism, highlighting the systemic inequalities that existed in the film industry during this period.\n\nThrough its characters and plot, Babylon offers a nuanced and complex portrayal of Hollywood's Golden Age, revealing the hidden tensions and conflicts that lay beneath the surface of the glamour and glitz. By exploring the darker aspects of the film industry, Chazelle sheds light on the human costs of the commercialization of art and the exploitation of talent.\n\n# Release\n\n## Theatrical\n\nBabylon premiered at the 79th Venice International Film Festival on August 31, 2022, where it received a 10-minute standing ovation. The film was released in the United States on December 23, 2022, by Paramount Pictures.\n\n## Home media\n\nBabylon was released on digital platforms on January 17, 2023, and on 4K Ultra HD, Blu-ray, and DVD on January 31, 2023.\n\n## Marketing\n\nThe film's marketing campaign was notable for its creative and provocative approach. The trailer featured a mix of stunning visuals and dramatic music, highlighting the film's epic scope and ambition. However, the campaign also courted controversy, with some critics accusing Chazelle of glorifying the excesses and scandals of the film industry.\n\n# Reception\n\n## Box office\n\nBabylon opened at number one at the US box office, grossing $8.3 million on its opening day. However, the film's box office performance was ultimately disappointing, with a worldwide gross of just over $120 million.\n\n## Critical response\n\nBabylon received generally positive reviews from critics, with many praising the film's visuals, music, and performances. However, some critics found the film's pacing and tone to be uneven, and others were put off by the film's graphic content and use of practical effects.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 74% approval rating, with an average rating of 6.8/10. On Metacritic, the film has a score of 68 out of 100, based on 44 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\n# Accolades\n\nBabylon received several awards and nominations, including:\n\n* 79th Venice International Film Festival:\n\t+ Golden Lion nomination\n\t+ Volpi Cup for Best Director (Damien Chazelle)\n* 28th Critics' Choice Awards:\n\t+ Best Director (Damien Chazelle)\n\t+ Best Actor in a Drama (Brad Pitt)\n\t+ Best Supporting Actor (Diego Calva)\n* 28th Screen Actors Guild Awards:\n\t+ Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture\n* 28th Independent Spirit Awards:\n\t+ Best Cinematography\n\t+ Best Editing\n\n# See also\n\n* List of films set in the 1920s\n* List of films about the film industry\n* Damien Chazelle bibliography\n\n# References\n\n# External links\n\n* Official website\n* Babylon at IMDb\n* Babylon at AllMovie\n* Babylon at Rotten Tomatoes\n* Babylon at Metacritic", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

They are a key concept in the study of black holes and the holographic principle. In this article, we will explore the physical properties of fuzzballs, their composition and densities, and their role in the information paradox. We will also discuss the testability of the theory and its implications for our understanding of the universe.\n\n# Physical properties\n\n## String theory and composition\n\nString theory posits that the fundamental building blocks of the universe are one-dimensional strings rather than point-like particles. These strings are too small to be observed directly, but they vibrate at different frequencies, giving rise to the various particles we observe in the universe. Fuzzballs are a specific type of string configuration that represents a localized region of space-time, much like a ball of fuzz.\n\nIn string theory, fuzzballs are thought to be the fundamental units of matter, and they can be represented as a collection of strings that are \"fuzzed\" together. This fuzzing process is a result of the strong coupling between the strings, which causes them to become entangled and form a single, coherent object. The properties of the fuzzball, such as its mass, charge, and spin, are determined by the vibrational modes of the strings that make it up.\n\n## Densities\n\nFuzzballs are typically very dense objects, with densities that approach the Planck density, which is the density of a black hole with a mass equal to the Planck mass. The Planck density is approximately 10^96 kilograms per cubic meter, which is an incredibly high density. Fuzzballs are thought to be the most dense objects in the universe, even more dense than black holes.\n\nThe high density of fuzzballs is a result of the strong coupling between the strings that make them up. As the strings become more tightly coupled, they begin to form a single, coherent object, which leads to a significant increase in density. The density of a fuzzball is determined by the number of strings that make it up, as well as the frequency at which they vibrate.\n\n## Neutron star collapse\n\nFuzzballs are thought to be the final state of a neutron star collapse. When a neutron star collapses, its density increases to the point where it becomes a black hole. However, if the collapse is slow enough, the star may not form a black hole, but instead will form a fuzzball.\n\nThe collapse of a neutron star is a complex process that involves the fragmentation of the star into smaller regions, each of which becomes a separate fuzzball. The properties of the fuzzball, such as its mass and charge, are determined by the properties of the neutron star that collapsed to form it.\n\n# Information paradox\n\nThe information paradox, also known as the black hole information paradox, is a problem in physics that arises when considering the fate of information contained in matter that falls into a black hole. The paradox suggests that the information contained in the matter is lost forever, which contradicts the principles of quantum mechanics, which suggest that information cannot be lost.\n\nFuzzballs are thought to resolve the information paradox by providing a mechanism for the preservation of information in a black hole. The information contained in the matter that falls into a fuzzball is encoded in the vibrational modes of the strings that make it up. This information is preserved even as the matter is compressed into a tiny region of space-time.\n\nThe preservation of information in a fuzzball is a result of the holographic principle, which suggests that the information contained in a region of space-time is encoded on its surface. In the case of a fuzzball, the surface is the surface of the fuzzball itself, and the information contained in the matter that makes it up is encoded in the vibrational modes of the strings that make it up.\n\n# Testability of the theory\n\nThe testability of the theory of fuzzballs is a topic of ongoing debate. While the theory is still highly speculative, it has been proposed that fuzzballs could be tested through the observation of the gravitational waves emitted by a black hole as it collapses into a fuzzball.\n\nThe detection of gravitational waves by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) has provided strong evidence for the existence of gravitational waves, and has opened up new possibilities for testing the theory of fuzzballs. However, the detection of gravitational waves is a difficult task, and it is likely to require significant advances in technology and theoretical understanding before it is possible to test the theory of fuzzballs directly.\n\n# References\n\nThis article does not contain any references.\n\n# External links\n\n* String theory and fuzzballs on the arXiv\n* Fuzzballs and the holographic principle on the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\n* The black hole information paradox on the arXiv", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The word \"tartan\" is derived from the French \"tartane,\" which referred to a type of woolen cloth. The term has evolved to encompass not only the fabric but also the distinctive pattern and symbolic associations that accompany it.\n\n**Etymology and terminology**\n\nThe term \"tartan\" is often used interchangeably with \"plaid,\" but technically, plaid refers to any type of fabric with a repeating pattern of stripes, while tartan specifically refers to the traditional Scottish patterns. The British Standards Institution defines tartan as a specific type of woven fabric with a set of rules governing the arrangement of colors and threads.\n\n**Weaving and design**\n\n### Weaving construction\n\nTartan fabric is woven using a specific type of loom, which allows for the precise control of thread tension and color placement. The warp threads, which run lengthwise, are typically made of wool or a wool-blend, while the weft threads, which run widthwise, can be made of a variety of materials, including wool, silk, or synthetic fibers. The warp and weft threads are woven together to create the distinctive tartan pattern.\n\n### Styles and design principles\n\nTartan designs can be broadly classified into two categories: symmetrical and asymmetrical. Symmetrical tartans, also known as \"balanced\" tartans, feature a repeating pattern that is symmetrical about a central axis. Asymmetrical tartans, also known as \"unbalanced\" tartans, feature a more complex and irregular pattern. Tartan designs often incorporate specific design principles, such as the use of specific colors, thread counts, and sett (the density of the weave).\n\n### Colour, palettes, and meaning\n\nTartan colors and palettes are often imbued with symbolic meaning, reflecting the wearer's identity, affiliation, or status. For example, the colors and patterns of a specific tartan may be associated with a particular clan or family, while the colors and patterns of another tartan may be associated with a specific region or occupation. The meanings of tartan colors and patterns can vary across different cultures and contexts.\n\n**Early history**\n\n### Pre-medieval origins\n\nThe earliest known evidence of tartan-like patterns dates back to the Neolithic period, with examples found in ancient Celtic art and textiles. The use of tartan patterns continued through the pre-medieval period, with evidence of tartan fabrics and textiles found in ancient Celtic and Roman artifacts.\n\n### Medieval\n\nDuring the medieval period, tartan patterns became more widespread and complex, with the development of new weaving techniques and the use of more vibrant colors. Tartan fabrics were highly valued for their durability, warmth, and aesthetic appeal, making them a staple of medieval clothing and textiles.\n\n### 16th century\n\nDuring the 16th century, tartan patterns became more standardized, with the development of specific rules and guidelines governing the arrangement of colors and threads. This period also saw the rise of tartan as a symbol of Scottish identity and culture.\n\n### 17th century\n\nThe 17th century saw a decline in the use of tartan patterns, as the English and Scottish monarchies imposed restrictions on their use. However, tartan continued to be used in secret, particularly among the Scottish clans, who saw it as a symbol of their heritage and identity.\n\n### 18th century\n\nThe 18th century saw a resurgence in the use of tartan patterns, particularly during the Jacobite risings, when tartan became a symbol of Scottish resistance against English rule. The use of tartan continued to be restricted, but it remained a powerful symbol of Scottish identity and culture.\n\n**Regimental tartans**\n\nRegimental tartans are specific tartan patterns associated with specific military units or regiments. These tartans are often unique and are used to identify the wearer's affiliation with a particular regiment or unit.\n\n**Clan tartans**\n\n### Long-running debate\n\nThe debate over the origins and meaning of clan tartans has been ongoing for centuries. Some argue that clan tartans are ancient and have been passed down through generations, while others argue that they are relatively modern and were created in the 19th century.\n\n### Earliest evidence\n\nThe earliest known evidence of clan tartans dates back to the 17th century, with examples found in ancient clan documents and records. However, the meanings and significance of these tartans are not well understood and continue to be the subject of debate.\n\n### Lack of further evidence of early adoption\n\nDespite the existence of early clan documents and records, there is a lack of evidence to suggest that clan tartans were widely used or recognized in the 17th and 18th centuries. This has led some to argue that clan tartans are relatively modern and were created in the 19th century.\n\n### 19th century broad adoption\n\nThe 19th century saw a widespread adoption of clan tartans, particularly among the Scottish clans. This was driven by a renewed interest in Scottish culture and heritage, as well as the development of new textile technologies and manufacturing processes.\n\n### 20th century consolidation\n\nThe 20th century saw a consolidation of clan tartans, with the establishment of formal rules and guidelines governing their use. This period also saw the rise of tartan as a global phenomenon, with the use of tartan patterns and designs becoming more widespread and diverse.\n\n### Recognition by clan chiefs\n\nThe recognition of clan tartans by clan chiefs is an important aspect of Scottish culture and heritage. Clan chiefs often have the authority to approve or reject the use of clan tartans, and their endorsement is seen as a symbol of authenticity and legitimacy.\n\n**Modern general use**\n\n### Late Georgian\n\nDuring the late Georgian period, tartan patterns became more widespread and fashionable, particularly among the upper classes. The introduction of new textile technologies and manufacturing processes made it possible to mass-produce tartan fabrics, making them more accessible to the general public.\n\n#### The King's jaunt in tartan\n\nIn 1815, King George IV visited Scotland and wore tartan-patterned clothing, marking a significant moment in the popularization of tartan. The King's visit helped to legitimize the use of tartan patterns and designs, making them more acceptable and fashionable among the upper classes.\n\n#### Civilian spread\n\nThe spread of tartan patterns and designs among the civilian population was driven by a renewed interest in Scottish culture and heritage. Tartan fabrics and textiles became more widely available, and their use became more widespread and fashionable.\n\n**Victorian**\n\nDuring the Victorian period, tartan patterns and designs reached new heights of popularity, particularly among the upper classes. The rise of the Industrial Revolution made it possible to mass-produce tartan fabrics, making them more accessible to the general public.\n\n#### Vestiarium Scoticum\n\nIn 1842, the Vestiarium Scoticum, a book on Scottish dress and textiles, was published. The book helped to codify and standardize tartan patterns and designs, and its influence can still be seen today.\n\n#### The Queen and \"Balmorality\"\n\nDuring the 1840s, Queen Victoria and her consort, Prince Albert, became patrons of Scottish culture and heritage. They popularized the use of tartan patterns and designs, particularly in their own clothing and decorative arts.\n\n#### Ripple effects\n\nThe popularity of tartan patterns and designs during the Victorian period had far-reaching effects, influencing fashion and culture not only in Scotland but also around the world. Tartan became a symbol of Scottish identity and culture, and its use continued to spread and evolve.\n\n**20th century to present**\n\n### Diaspora and globalisation\n\nThe 20th century saw a significant diaspora of the Scottish people, with many Scots emigrating to other parts of the world. This led to a wider dissemination of tartan patterns and designs, as Scots took their cultural heritage with them wherever they went.\n\n### Industry and politics\n\nThe 20th century also saw significant changes in the textile industry, with the decline of traditional textile manufacturing and the rise of globalisation. This had a profound impact on the use of tartan patterns and designs, as traditional textile manufacturers struggled to compete with cheaper imports.\n\n### In popular culture\n\nTartan has appeared in popular culture in numerous films, television shows, and other media, often as a symbol of Scottish identity and culture. The use of tartan patterns and designs in popular culture has helped to further popularise and globalise the use of tartan.\n\n**Popular designs**\n\nTartan designs can be broadly classified into several categories, including:\n\n* **Regional**: Tartans that are specific to a particular region or area.\n* **Hunting, mourning, dress, and dance**: Tartans that are associated with specific activities or occasions.\n* **Family and individual**: Tartans that are associated with specific families or individuals.\n* **Corporate and commercial**: Tartans that are used by companies or organisations for branding and marketing purposes.\n\n**Tartans for specific purposes**\n\nTartans can be used for a variety of purposes, including:\n\n* **Regional**: Tartans can be used to identify a person's region or place of origin.\n* **Hunting, mourning, dress, and dance**: Tartans can be used to identify a person's occupation or affiliation.\n* **Family and individual**: Tartans can be used to identify a person's family or individual identity.\n* **Corporate and commercial**: Tartans can be used by companies or organisations for branding and marketing purposes.\n\n**Regulation**\n\nThe use of tartan patterns and designs is regulated by various laws and guidelines, including:\n\n* **Registration**: Tartans can be registered with the Scottish Tartans Authority or other organisations.\n* **Legal protection**: Tartans can be protected by law, preventing their misuse or misrepresentation.\n* **Etiquette**: There are guidelines governing the use of tartan patterns and designs, including rules about their proper use and representation.\n\n**In other cultures**\n\nTartan patterns and designs have been adopted and adapted by other cultures, including:\n\n* **Africa**: The Maasai people of East Africa have adopted tartan patterns and designs, using them in their traditional clothing and textiles.\n* **East and South Asia**: The Bhutanese people have adopted tartan patterns and designs, using them in their traditional clothing and textiles.\n* **India**: The Indian people have adopted tartan patterns and designs, using them in their traditional clothing and textiles.\n* **Japan**: The Japanese people have adopted tartan patterns and designs, using them in their traditional clothing and textiles.\n\n**See also**\n\n* **Patterns**: Tartan patterns and designs can be found in a variety of other contexts, including textiles, fashion, and design.\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article provides a comprehensive overview of tartan patterns and designs, their history, and their cultural significance.\n* The article draws on a range of sources, including academic research, historical documents, and popular culture.\n\n**References**\n\n* This article does not include citations or references.\n\n**External links**\n\n* Scottish Tartans Authority\n* Tartan.com\n* Wikipedia: Scottish tartans", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

He is one of the most influential and innovative filmmakers of the 20th century, known for his contributions to the French New Wave movement and his experimentation with film language. Born on December 3, 1930, in Paris, France, Godard grew up in a middle-class family and developed an interest in film at an early age.\n\nEarly life\n\nGodard's family moved to Switzerland when he was a young boy, and he spent most of his childhood in Rolle, a small town on the shores of Lake Geneva. He was a shy and introverted child, who found solace in reading and writing. Godard's father, a Swiss engineer, encouraged his son's interest in film, and he began making short films at the age of 15.\n\nEarly career (1950–1959)\n\n### Film criticism\n\nGodard's interest in film led him to become a film critic, and he began writing reviews for the French film magazine, Cahiers du Cinéma. In the 1950s, he became a key figure in the \"Cahiers du Cinéma\" group, a collective of young film critics who would go on to become some of the most influential filmmakers of the French New Wave movement. Godard's film criticism was characterized by his emphasis on the importance of the director's personal vision and his rejection of traditional Hollywood-style filmmaking.\n\n### Filmmaking\n\nGodard's early filmmaking experience consisted of making short films and working as an assistant to other directors. In 1955, he made his first feature film, \"Breathless,\" which was a critical and commercial success. \"Breathless\" was a landmark film of the French New Wave movement, known for its innovative storytelling, cinematography, and use of location shooting.\n\nNew Wave period (1960–1967)\n\nThe 1960s were a pivotal period in Godard's career, marked by his experimentation with film language and his exploration of themes such as alienation, consumerism, and politics. During this period, Godard made some of his most influential films, including \"Vivre sa vie\" (1962), \"Le petit soldat\" (1960), and \"Contempt\" (1963).\n\n### Breathless\n\n\"Breatless,\" Godard's first feature film, was a critical and commercial success. The film tells the story of a car thief, played by Jean-Paul Belmondo, who is on the run from the police. The film's innovative storytelling, cinematography, and use of location shooting established Godard as a major talent in the French New Wave movement.\n\n### Early work with Anna Karina\n\nIn the early 1960s, Godard began working with his future wife, Anna Karina, a Danish actress who had recently arrived in Paris. Karina became a regular star of Godard's films, appearing in \"Vivre sa vie\" (1962), \"Le petit soldat\" (1960), and \"Contempt\" (1963). Godard's films with Karina were known for their innovative storytelling, cinematography, and use of location shooting.\n\n### Vivre sa vie\n\n\"Vivre sa vie\" (1962) was a critical and commercial success, known for its innovative storytelling and cinematography. The film tells the story of a young woman, played by Karina, who becomes a prostitute in order to support herself and her child. The film's use of location shooting and its exploration of themes such as alienation and consumerism established Godard as a major talent in the French New Wave movement.\n\n### Le petit soldat and Les Carabiniers\n\nIn the early 1960s, Godard made two films that explored the theme of war and politics. \"Le petit soldat\" (1960) was a critical and commercial success, known for its innovative storytelling and cinematography. The film tells the story of a young man, played by Michel Siegal, who becomes involved in the Algerian War. \"Les Carabiniers\" (1963) was a more experimental film, which explored the theme of war and politics through a series of vignettes.\n\n### Contempt\n\n\"Contempt\" (1963) was a critical and commercial success, known for its innovative storytelling and cinematography. The film tells the story of a screenwriter, played by Michel Piccoli, who is hired to adapt a novel for the screen. The film's exploration of themes such as alienation and consumerism established Godard as a major talent in the French New Wave movement.\n\n### Anouchka Films\n\nIn the early 1960s, Godard began working with his own production company, Anouchka Films. The company produced a number of Godard's films, including \"Contempt\" (1963) and \"Week End\" (1967). Anouchka Films was known for its innovative approach to film production, which emphasized the importance of the director's personal vision.\n\n### Week End\n\n\"Week End\" (1967) was a critical and commercial success, known for its innovative storytelling and cinematography. The film tells the story of a middle-class couple, played by Mireille Darc and Jean Yanne, who embark on a road trip across France. The film's exploration of themes such as alienation and consumerism established Godard as a major talent in the French New Wave movement.\n\nPolitical period (1968–1979)\n\nThe late 1960s and early 1970s were a pivotal period in Godard's career, marked by his increasing involvement in politics and his experimentation with new forms of filmmaking. During this period, Godard made a number of films that explored the theme of politics and revolution, including \"Voyage en Italie\" (1965), \"La Chinoise\" (1967), and \"One Plus One\" (1968).\n\n### Vietnam War\n\nIn the late 1960s, Godard became increasingly involved in anti-war activism, particularly with regard to the Vietnam War.

The phenomenon began on June 24, 1947, and continued through July and August, with reports pouring in from various parts of the country.\n\n**Events of Summer 1947**\n\nThe 1947 flying disc craze began on June 24, 1947, when businessman and pilot Kenneth Arnold reported seeing nine disk-shaped objects flying in formation over Mount Rainier, Washington. Arnold's sighting was the first of many reports that would flood the media and public consciousness over the next several weeks.\n\n### Initial reports\n\nArnold's sighting was initially met with skepticism by the press and the public, but it sparked a wave of reports from other witnesses who claimed to have seen similar objects in the sky. On June 25, 1947, the _Seattle Post-Intelligencer_ published a story about Arnold's sighting, and within days, other newspapers across the country were reporting on similar sightings.\n\n### Additional reports\n\nAs the week went on, more reports came in from various parts of the country. On June 26, 1947, the _Spokane Daily Chronicle_ reported on a sighting by a group of people in the town of Dayton, Washington, who claimed to have seen a disk-shaped object flying low over the town. Other reports came in from Oregon, Idaho, and Montana, all describing similar objects.\n\n### Pacific Northwest reports amid jet speculation\n\nThe Pacific Northwest was the epicenter of the flying disc craze, with multiple reports coming in from Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. However, as the week went on, reports began to come in from other parts of the country, including the Midwest and the East Coast. Some of these reports suggested that the objects may have been military aircraft, including the new Bell X-1 \"Sonic Boom\" jet, which was a top-secret aircraft being tested by the US Air Force.\n\n### Reports throughout the West\n\nAs the flying disc craze continued, reports began to come in from other parts of the West, including California, Nevada, and Arizona. Some of these reports suggested that the objects were seen flying at extremely high speeds, and that they were emitting bright lights and other strange phenomena.\n\n### Potential explanations offered\n\nAs the flying disc craze continued, various explanations were offered for the sightings. Some suggested that the objects were military aircraft, while others believed that they may have been extraterrestrial in origin. Others proposed more mundane explanations, such as the objects being weather balloons or other types of aircraft.\n\n### Lt. Governor sighting followed by official investigation\n\nOn July 2, 1947, the Lt. Governor of Washington, John A. Cherberg, came forward with a sighting of his own, claiming to have seen a disk-shaped object flying over the state capitol building in Olympia. This sighting sparked an official investigation by the Washington State government, which was headed by Lt. Governor Cherberg himself.\n\n### San Francisco fireworks and stories of landings\n\nOn July 4, 1947, the city of San Francisco was abuzz with excitement as reports began to come in of a flying disc sighting in the city's skies. Some witnesses claimed to have seen the object landing in a nearby park, while others reported seeing it flying low over the city. However, these reports were later disputed as being the result of fireworks displays and other pranks.\n\n### July 4 press reports\n\nThe July 4 press reports were some of the most extensive and dramatic of the flying disc craze. Many newspapers across the country ran front-page stories about the sightings, with some claiming to have seen the objects landing in various locations.\n\n### Flight 105\n\nOn July 4, 1947, a commercial airliner, Flight 105, reported seeing a disk-shaped object flying near the plane. The crew and passengers claimed to have seen the object, which was described as being about 20 feet in diameter.\n\n### Group sightings\n\nAs the flying disc craze continued, more and more group sightings were reported. On July 5, 1947, a group of people in the town of Dayton, Washington, reported seeing a disk-shaped object flying low over the town. Other group sightings were reported in Oregon, Idaho, and Montana.\n\n### Atomic link claimed\n\nSome reports suggested that the flying discs were linked to the atomic bomb, which had been dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki just a few years earlier. Some believed that the objects were somehow related to the nuclear energy released by the bomb.\n\n### Reports peak\n\nBy mid-July, reports of the flying discs had reached a peak, with multiple sightings being reported each day. However, as the week went on, the number of reports began to decrease, and by the end of July, the flying disc craze had begun to subside.\n\n### Weather balloons, pranks, and hoaxes\n\nAs the flying disc craze continued, some reports began to suggest that the objects may have been weather balloons or other types of aircraft. Others proposed more mundane explanations, such as the objects being the result of pranks or hoaxes.\n\n### Roswell debris\n\nOn July 8, 1947, a strange object was discovered in the desert near Roswell, New Mexico. The object was initially reported to be a flying disc, but later turned out to be a weather balloon. However, the incident would go on to become one of the most enduring UFO legends of all time.\n\n### Reports diminish\n\nAs the flying disc craze continued, the number of reports began to decrease. By the end of July, the sightings had largely ceased, and the public's attention had moved on to other news stories.\n\n### Hoaxed discs recovered in Hollywood and Detroit\n\nIn the aftermath of the flying disc craze, several hoaxed discs were recovered in Hollywood and Detroit. These discs were later revealed to be pranks or publicity stunts.\n\n### Balloons\n\nSome reports suggested that the flying discs may have been weather balloons or other types of aircraft. However, these explanations were not widely accepted by the public or the media.\n\n### Twin Falls recovered disc hoax\n\nOn July 8, 1947, a group of people in Twin Falls, Idaho, reported recovering a flying disc that had crashed in the area. However, the disc was later revealed to be a hoax.\n\n##Reports subside\n\nBy the end of July, the flying disc craze had largely subsided, with few reports of sightings being made. However, the incident had left a lasting impact on the public's imagination, and the idea of flying discs would go on to become a staple of science fiction and popular culture.\n\n### Crash at Kelso\n\nOn July 29, 1947, a strange object was discovered in the woods near Kelso, Washington. The object was later revealed to be a piece of a plane that had crashed, but some believed that it may have been a flying disc.\n\n##Public awareness\n\nThe flying disc craze had a significant impact on public awareness, with many people becoming interested in the idea of UFOs and extraterrestrial life. The incident also sparked a wave of interest in science fiction and speculative fiction.\n\n##Maps and table of reports\n\n Maps and tables of the reported sightings can be found in various sources, including newspapers and books.\n\n##Contemporary interpretations\n\nThe 1947 flying disc craze has been interpreted in various ways by contemporary scholars and experts. Some have proposed technological explanations, such as the objects being advanced military aircraft. Others have suggested more conventional explanations, such as the objects being weather balloons or other types of aircraft.\n\n### Technological\n\nSome have proposed that the flying discs may have been advanced military aircraft, such as the Bell X-1 \"Sonic Boom\" jet. Others have suggested that the objects may have been experimental aircraft or drones.\n\n### Conventional\n\nOthers have proposed more conventional explanations, such as the objects being weather balloons or other types of aircraft. Some have suggested that the sightings may have been the result of misidentification of natural phenomena, such as meteors or clouds.\n\n### Behavioral\n\nSome have suggested that the flying disc craze may have been the result of mass hysteria or a collective delusion. Others have proposed that the sightings may have been the result of a psychological phenomenon, such as a shared hallucination.\n\n### Interplanetary\n\nOthers have proposed that the flying discs may have been extraterrestrial in origin, with some suggesting that the objects may have been spacecraft from other planets or galaxies.\n\n### Biological\n\nSome have suggested that the flying discs may have been biological in origin, with some proposing that the objects may have been living organisms or creatures from other planets or galaxies.\n\n### Eschatological\n\nOthers have proposed that the flying disc craze may have been an apocalyptic event or a sign of the end of the world. Some have suggested that the sightings may have been a warning or a message from a higher power or a supernatural being.\n\n### Occult\n\nSome have suggested that the flying disc craze may have been an occult or spiritual event, with some proposing that the objects may have been manifestations of a higher power or a supernatural being.\n\n### Esoteric\n\nOthers have proposed that the flying disc craze may have been an esoteric or mystical event, with some suggesting that the objects may have been symbols or manifestations of a higher truth or reality.\n\n##Aftermath\n\nThe 1947 flying disc craze had a lasting impact on popular culture and the public's imagination. The incident sparked a wave of interest in science fiction and speculative fiction, and the idea of flying discs would go on to become a staple of popular culture.\n\n### Flying saucer conspiracy theories\n\nThe 1947 flying disc craze has been linked to various conspiracy theories, including the idea that the government or other organizations are covering up extraterrestrial life or the existence of advanced technologies.\n\n### Roswell conspiracy theory\n\nThe Roswell incident, which occurred in July 1947, has been linked to various conspiracy theories, including the idea that the government or other organizations are covering up extraterrestrial life or the existence of advanced technologies.\n\n### Project Mogul and Skyhook\n\nSome have suggested that the flying discs may have been related to Project Mogul and Skyhook, which were US government projects that involved the development of advanced aircraft and surveillance systems.\n\n#See also\n\n* UFO\n* Exoplanet\n* Alien\n* Spacecraft\n* Science fiction\n* Speculative fiction\n* Conspiracy theory\n* Roswell incident\n\n#Further reading\n\n* \"The Flying Discs\" by R.

The party was founded in 1972 by M. G. Ramachandran (MGR), a renowned film actor, and was originally an offshoot of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK). The AIADMK has been a dominant force in Tamil Nadu politics for over four decades, with a strong presence in the state's legislative assembly and a significant influence on national politics.\n\n# Ideology and policies\n\n## Culture\n\nThe AIADMK has traditionally been associated with a strong emphasis on Tamil culture, language, and heritage. The party has promoted the use of Tamil as the official language of Tamil Nadu, and has supported the development of Tamil literature, art, and architecture. The AIADMK has also been a strong advocate for the preservation of Tamil Nadu's cultural traditions and customs.\n\n## Economy\n\nThe AIADMK has implemented several economic policies to promote industrial growth, employment, and poverty reduction in Tamil Nadu. The party has encouraged foreign investment, promoted the development of small-scale industries, and implemented measures to improve infrastructure, including roads, ports, and power supply. The AIADMK has also implemented policies to promote social welfare, including free food, shelter, and healthcare for the poor.\n\n## Social justice\n\nThe AIADMK has a strong commitment to social justice, particularly for the marginalized sections of society. The party has implemented policies to promote the rights of women, Dalits, and other backward castes, including reservations in education and employment, and measures to improve their economic conditions. The AIADMK has also been a strong advocate for the rights of farmers, fishermen, and other rural communities.\n\n## State water policy\n\nThe AIADMK has implemented several policies to manage water resources effectively in Tamil Nadu. The party has promoted the use of rainwater harvesting, and has implemented measures to improve irrigation, including the development of canals, dams, and reservoirs. The AIADMK has also implemented policies to promote the use of water-efficient technologies, including drip irrigation and sprinkler systems.\n\n## Environment and nature\n\nThe AIADMK has a strong commitment to environmental protection and conservation. The party has implemented policies to promote afforestation, and has implemented measures to prevent pollution, including the development of green belts and the promotion of eco-friendly industries. The AIADMK has also been a strong advocate for the preservation of natural habitats, including forests, wetlands, and wildlife sanctuaries.\n\n# History\n\n## M. G. Ramachandran era (1972–87)\n\nM. G. Ramachandran, a film actor and a prominent politician, founded the AIADMK in 1972. Ramachandran was a charismatic leader who drew massive support from the people of Tamil Nadu. He was a strong advocate for Tamil culture, language, and heritage, and implemented several policies to promote the development of Tamil Nadu. Ramachandran's leadership and policies helped the AIADMK become a dominant force in Tamil Nadu politics.\n\n### Succession conflict between the Janaki and Jayalalithaa factions\n\nAfter Ramachandran's death in 1987, a succession conflict emerged between two factions within the AIADMK. The first faction, led by Janaki Ramachandran, Ramachandran's widow, sought to continue his legacy. The second faction, led by Jayalalithaa, a close associate of Ramachandran, argued that she was the natural successor to the party leadership. The conflict between the two factions led to a split in the party, with the Janaki faction emerging as the AIADMK (P) and the Jayalalithaa faction emerging as the AIADMK.\n\n## J. Jayalalithaa era (1989–2016)\n\nJayalalithaa became the leader of the AIADMK in 1989 and led the party to a landslide victory in the 1991 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly elections. Jayalalithaa implemented several policies to promote the development of Tamil Nadu, including the development of infrastructure, education, and healthcare. She also implemented measures to promote social welfare, including the provision of free food, shelter, and healthcare for the poor.\n\n### Expansion beyond Tamil Nadu and Puducherry\n\nUnder Jayalalithaa's leadership, the AIADMK expanded its presence beyond Tamil Nadu and Puducherry. The party contested elections in other states, including the Indian general elections, and won several seats. The AIADMK also established a strong presence in the Lok Sabha, with several of its members becoming union ministers.\n\n## V. K. Sasikala and T. T. V. Dhinakaran era (2016–17)\n\nAfter Jayalalithaa's death in 2016, V. K. Sasikala, Jayalalithaa's close associate, became the leader of the AIADMK. Sasikala implemented several policies to promote the development of Tamil Nadu, including the development of infrastructure and education. However, her leadership was short-lived, as she was expelled from the party in 2017 along with T. T. V. Dhinakaran, a close associate of Sasikala.\n\n## O. Panneerselvam and Edappadi K. Palaniswami era (2017–22)\n\nAfter the expulsion of Sasikala and Dhinakaran, O. Panneerselvam, a senior leader of the AIADMK, became the leader of the party. Panneerselvam implemented several policies to promote the development of Tamil Nadu, including the development of infrastructure and education. However, his leadership was challenged by Edappadi K. Palaniswami, a close associate of Sasikala, who sought to become the leader of the party. The leadership tussle between Panneerselvam and Palaniswami led to a split in the party, with the Panneerselvam faction emerging as the AIADMK (P) and the Palaniswami faction emerging as the AIADMK.\n\n### Legal fight for the party by V. K. Sasikala and T. T. V. Dhinakaran\n\nSasikala and Dhinakaran challenged the expulsion from the party in court, arguing that they were unfairly removed from the party. The case was heard by the Madras High Court, which ruled in favor of the Palaniswami faction. Sasikala and Dhinakaran appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, which upheld the ruling of the Madras High Court.\n\n### Tensions with BJP\n\nThe AIADMK has faced tensions with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over several issues, including the development of infrastructure and education. The party has also faced criticism from the BJP over its handling of the Tamil Nadu government's financial affairs.\n\n### Leadership tussle between O. Panneerselvam and Edappadi K. Palaniswami\n\nThe leadership tussle between Panneerselvam and Palaniswami continued for several years, with both leaders seeking to become the leader of the party. The tussle led to a split in the party, with the Panneerselvam faction emerging as the AIADMK (P) and the Palaniswami faction emerging as the AIADMK.\n\n## Edappadi K. Palaniswami era (2022–present)\n\nAfter the leadership tussle between Panneerselvam and Palaniswami, Palaniswami emerged as the leader of the AIADMK. Palaniswami implemented several policies to promote the development of Tamil Nadu, including the development of infrastructure and education. He also implemented measures to promote social welfare, including the provision of free food, shelter, and healthcare for the poor.\n\n# Electoral performance\n\n## Indian general elections\n\nThe AIADMK has contested several Indian general elections, including the 1991, 1996, 1998, 1999, 2004, 2009, and 2014 elections. The party won several seats in the Lok Sabha, with its members becoming union ministers.\n\n## State legislative assembly elections\n\nThe AIADMK has contested several state legislative assembly elections in Tamil Nadu, including the 1991, 1996, 2001, 2006, 2011, and 2016 elections. The party won several seats in the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly, with its members becoming chief ministers.\n\n# Current office bearers and prominent members\n\n## General Secretaries\n\n* Edappadi K.

It has its roots in the early 20th century labor movement and has evolved over the years to become a widely observed holiday around the world.\n\nHistory\n\n### Origins\n\nThe origins of International Women's Day can be traced back to the early 20th century, when women's suffrage movements were gaining momentum in various countries. In 1908, 15,000 women marched through New York City demanding better pay, shorter hours, and voting rights. The following year, on February 28, 1909, the first National Woman's Day was observed in the United States.\n\n### The Russian Revolution and Communist countries\n\nIn 1917, the Russian Revolution led to the overthrow of the Tsarist government, and the Bolsheviks came to power. The new government, led by Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trotsky, declared March 8 as International Women's Day, a day to honor the women who had played a crucial role in the revolution. The holiday was meant to commemorate the 1917 demonstrations by women in Petrograd (now St. Petersburg) that had helped spark the February Revolution.\n\nThe Soviet Union and its Eastern European allies continued to observe International Women's Day, and the holiday became an important part of the socialist and communist movements. The holiday was seen as a way to promote women's rights and equality, and it was often used as a platform to advocate for women's participation in politics and the workforce.\n\n### Other countries, 1920s to 1960s\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, International Women's Day began to gain recognition in other countries, including the United Kingdom, France, and China. The holiday was often observed by women's organizations and labor unions, and it became a symbol of solidarity between women across national borders.\n\nIn the post-World War II era, International Women's Day became an important part of the feminist movement in the United States and Europe. Women's organizations and activists used the holiday as a platform to advocate for women's rights, including reproductive rights, equal pay, and an end to sexism and misogyny.\n\n### Second-wave feminism\n\nThe second wave of feminism, which emerged in the 1960s and 1970s, saw International Women's Day as an opportunity to promote women's rights and challenge patriarchal societies. The holiday was used to organize protests, demonstrations, and rallies, and it became a symbol of resistance against sexism and oppression.\n\n### Adoption by United Nations\n\nIn 1975, the United Nations (UN) officially adopted International Women's Day, recognizing the holiday as an important milestone in the struggle for women's rights and equality. The UN has since used the holiday to promote women's empowerment and to highlight the contributions of women to society.\n\n### Adoption by corporations\n\nIn recent years, many corporations have adopted International Women's Day as a way to promote women's rights and equality in the workplace. Many companies use the holiday to launch initiatives and campaigns aimed at promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion.\n\nInternational Women's Day by year\n\n### 1995\n\nIn 1995, International Women's Day was observed with a major conference in Beijing, China, where women's leaders and activists from around the world gathered to discuss women's rights and empowerment.\n\n### 1996\n\nIn 1996, the theme of International Women's Day was \"Women's Empowerment and Equality.\" The holiday was observed with events and activities around the world, including protests and demonstrations against sexism and misogyny.\n\n### 2003\n\nIn 2003, International Women's Day was observed with a focus on women's health and reproductive rights.

The election took place from July 5 to September 5, 2022.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Brexit and the 2019 leadership election\n\nThe 2019 Conservative Party leadership election was held amidst the Brexit crisis, and Boris Johnson emerged as the winner, defeating Jeremy Hunt. Johnson's campaign focused on leaving the European Union by October 31, 2019, with or without a deal. The party's membership played a significant role in the election, with members voting to select the next leader. This was the first time the Conservative Party had used a membership vote to select its leader.\n\n### 2019 general election\n\nThe 2019 general election was held on December 12, 2019, with the Conservative Party winning a landslide majority. Johnson's campaign focused on Brexit and the promise to \"get Brexit done.\" The party's manifesto included a commitment to leave the EU on January 31, 2020, with a trade deal to be negotiated thereafter. The election saw the Conservative Party win 365 seats, the largest majority since the 1987 general election.\n\n### COVID-19 pandemic and Partygate\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the Conservative Party, with Johnson's government facing criticism for its handling of the crisis. The Partygate scandal, which involved allegations of lockdown-breaching parties at 10 Downing Street, further damaged the party's reputation. The scandal led to the resignations of several high-ranking government ministers, including Dominic Cummings and Lee Cain.\n\n### June 2022 confidence vote\n\nOn June 6, 2022, Johnson survived a confidence vote among Conservative MPs, with 211 voting in favor of his leadership and 148 against. The vote was called after a series of resignations from Johnson's government, including the resignation of Conservative Party Chairman Oliver Dowden. The vote was seen as a significant blow to Johnson's leadership, and it was clear that his position was becoming increasingly untenable.\n\n### Government crisis\n\nThe Conservative Party was plunged into crisis in the summer of 2022, with Johnson's leadership under intense scrutiny. Several high-ranking government ministers resigned, including Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak and Health Secretary Sajid Javid. The resignations sparked a leadership crisis, with several MPs calling for Johnson to step down. On July 5, 2022, Johnson announced that he would be standing down as Conservative leader, paving the way for a leadership election.\n\n**Election details**\n\nThe election was held to choose a new leader to replace Boris Johnson. The election was open to all Conservative MPs, and the winner would be the one who secured the support of at least 50% of the votes cast.\n\n**Campaign**\n\nThe campaign for the leadership election began immediately after Johnson's resignation. Several MPs quickly announced their intention to stand, including Rishi Sunak, Liz Truss, and Penny Mordaunt. The campaign was marked by a series of debates and hustings, which were held to give candidates the opportunity to set out their vision for the party and the country.\n\n**Candidates**\n\n### Nominated\n\nSeveral MPs nominated themselves for the leadership election. The main candidates were:\n\n* Rishi Sunak (former Chancellor of the Exchequer)\n* Liz Truss (former Foreign Secretary)\n* Penny Mordaunt (former Defense Secretary)\n* Tom Tugendhat (Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee)\n* Kemi Badenoch (former Minister for Equalities)\n* Suella Braverman (former Attorney General)\n* Jeremy Hunt (former Health Secretary)\n\n### Withdrew\n\nSeveral MPs withdrew from the leadership election, including:\n\n* Sajid Javid (former Chancellor of the Exchequer)\n* Grant Shapps (former Transport Secretary)\n* Michael Gove (former Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster)\n\n### Publicly expressed interest\n\nSeveral MPs publicly expressed interest in standing for the leadership election, but ultimately did not nominate themselves. These included:\n\n* Jacob Rees-Mogg (former Leader of the House of Commons)\n* Dominic Raab (former Deputy Prime Minister)\n* Priti Patel (former Home Secretary)\n\n### Declined\n\nSeveral MPs declined to stand for the leadership election, including:\n\n* Boris Johnson (former Prime Minister)\n* Michael Gove (former Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster)\n* Sajid Javid (former Chancellor of the Exchequer)\n\n### Endorsements\n\nSeveral MPs publicly endorsed candidates for the leadership election. The main endorsements were:\n\n* Rishi Sunak was endorsed by:\n\t+ Sajid Javid (former Chancellor of the Exchequer)\n\t+ Grant Shapps (former Transport Secretary)\n* Liz Truss was endorsed by:\n\t+ Boris Johnson (former Prime Minister)\n\t+ Dominic Raab (former Deputy Prime Minister)\n\n**Timeline**\n\nThe leadership election took place from July 5 to September 5, 2022. The key dates were:\n\n* July 5, 2022: Boris Johnson announces that he will be standing down as Conservative leader\n* July 5, 2022: The leadership election is confirmed, and several MPs announce their intention to stand\n* July 13, 2022: The first round of voting takes place\n* July 19, 2022: The second round of voting takes place\n* July 21, 2022: The third round of voting takes place\n* September 5, 2022: The final round of voting takes place, and Liz Truss is elected as the new leader of the Conservative Party\n\n**Debates**\n\nThe leadership election featured a series of debates, which were held to give candidates the opportunity to set out their vision for the party and the country. The debates were broadcast on television and online, and were watched by millions of people.\n\n### Public reaction\n\nThe public reaction to the debates was mixed. Some viewers praised the candidates for their performances, while others were critical of their policies and personalities. The debates sparked a lively debate on social media, with many people sharing their thoughts and opinions on the candidates.\n\n**Public hustings**\n\nThe leadership election featured a series of public hustings, which were held in different parts of the country. The hustings gave candidates the opportunity to meet the public and answer their questions. The hustings were widely covered in the media, and were seen as an important opportunity for candidates to connect with voters.\n\n**Opinion polling**\n\nSeveral opinion polls were conducted during the leadership election, which showed the relative popularity of the candidates. The polls were widely reported in the media, and were seen as an important indicator of the candidates' chances of winning.\n\n### Sunak vs. Truss\n\nThe opinion polls showed a close contest between Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss. The polls suggested that Sunak had a slight lead in the early stages of the election, but Truss closed the gap as the campaign progressed.\n\n### Sunak vs. Truss vs. Johnson\n\nThe polls also showed that Boris Johnson was still popular among Conservative MPs, despite his resignation. However, the polls suggested that his popularity was waning, and that he was no longer a serious contender for the leadership.\n\n### Party members\n\nThe opinion polls among Conservative Party members showed a similar pattern to the polls among the general public. The polls suggested that Sunak had a slight lead, but that Truss was closing the gap.\n\n### Public\n\nThe opinion polls among the general public showed a very different picture. The polls suggested that Truss was significantly more popular than Sunak, and that she had a strong lead going into the final round of voting.\n\n**Results**\n\nThe final round of voting took place on September 5, 2022, and was won by Liz Truss. Truss secured 57.4% of the votes cast, with Rishi Sunak securing 42.6%. Truss was elected as the new leader of the Conservative Party, and subsequently became the new Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.\n\n**See also**\n\n* 2019 Conservative Party leadership election\n* 2022 Conservative Party leadership election\n* Boris Johnson\n* Rishi Sunak\n* Liz Truss\n\n**Notes**\n\nThe leadership election was a significant event in British politics, and marked a new chapter in the history of the Conservative Party. The election was widely covered in the media, and sparked a lively debate on social media. The election was also seen as a significant test of the Conservative Party's ability to adapt to changing circumstances, and to connect with voters in a rapidly changing world.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

It emerged as a response to various issues within the Catholic Church, including corruption, abuse of power, and theological disagreements. The Reformation had a profound impact on the course of European history, shaping the development of modern Christianity, politics, and culture.\n\n# Terminology\n\nThe term \"Reformation\" comes from the Latin \"reformatio,\" meaning \"renewal\" or \"reformation.\" It refers to the broader movement of Christian reform that took place in the 16th century. The Reformation was not a single event, but rather a complex process that unfolded over several decades.\n\n# Background\n\n## Calamities\n\nThe 15th century was marked by a series of calamities, including the Black Death, which ravaged Europe and led to a significant decline in the population. This, in turn, led to social and economic instability, which further contributed to the rise of the Reformation.\n\n## Late Medieval Christianity\n\n### Institutions\n\nThe Catholic Church was a powerful institution that dominated all aspects of medieval life. It was responsible for the education, healthcare, and welfare of the population. However, the Church's institutions were often corrupt and ineffective, leading to widespread dissatisfaction.\n\n### Clergy\n\nThe clergy was seen as detached from the laity and was often perceived as being more concerned with their own interests than with the spiritual well-being of their flock. This led to a growing sense of disillusionment with the Church.\n\n### Papacy\n\nThe papacy was seen as being in a state of crisis. The Pope's power was being challenged by the rise of nationalism and the emergence of powerful monarchs who were seeking to assert their authority.\n\n### Partial and failed institutional reforms\n\nIn the late 15th century, there were several attempts at reforms within the Church, including the Council of Basel and the Council of Florence. However, these reforms were ultimately unsuccessful in addressing the Church's deep-seated problems.\n\n## Humanism and lay religion\n\nThe emergence of humanism in the 15th century led to a renewed interest in classical learning and the study of the Bible. This, in turn, led to a growing sense of lay religiosity, as more and more people began to take an active interest in their own spiritual lives.\n\n## Dissidents\n\nThere were several dissident groups within the Church, including the Waldensians and the Lollards, who were critical of the Church's institutions and practices. These groups laid the groundwork for the emergence of the Protestant movement.\n\n# Beginnings\n\n## Luther and the Ninety-five Theses\n\nThe Reformation is often seen as beginning with Martin Luther's posting of the Ninety-five Theses in 1517. Luther's criticisms of the Church's sale of indulgences sparked a wider debate about the nature of the Church and the sacraments.\n\n## New theology\n\nLuther's theology was centered on the idea of justification by faith alone, which he saw as a radical departure from the Church's emphasis on good works. This new theology was to have a profound impact on the development of Protestantism.\n\n## Spread\n\nLuther's ideas quickly spread throughout Germany and beyond, attracting a wide following among the laity and clergy alike. This led to a growing divide between the Protestant and Catholic churches.\n\n## Resistance and oppression\n\nThe Catholic Church responded to the Reformation with resistance and oppression, including the burning of heretics and the use of force to suppress the movement.\n\n# Alternatives\n\n## Saxon radicals and rebellious knights\n\nIn addition to Luther, there were other radical groups within Germany, including the Saxon radicals and rebellious knights, who sought to create a more radical and revolutionary Christianity.\n\n## Zwingli\n\nHuldrych Zwingli, a Swiss reformer, emerged as a major figure in the Reformation. He sought to create a more radical and theocratic society in Zurich.\n\n## Swiss Brethren\n\nThe Swiss Brethren, a group of Anabaptists, emerged in the 1520s as a radical offshoot of the Reformation. They sought to create a more pure and communal form of Christianity.\n\n## Peasants' War\n\nThe Peasants' War, a major uprising in Germany, was sparked by the Reformation and the growing sense of social and economic discontent among the peasantry.\n\n# Consolidation\n\n## Princely Reformation in Germany\n\nThe Princely Reformation in Germany, led by Charles V and the German princes, sought to consolidate the Protestant movement and create a more stable and ordered society.\n\n## Stalemate in Switzerland\n\nThe Reformation in Switzerland remained a stalemate, with the Catholic and Protestant cantons competing for power and influence.\n\n## Schleitheim Articles\n\nThe Schleitheim Articles, a set of Anabaptist documents, laid out a radical vision of Christianity, emphasizing the importance of adult baptism and the rejection of the state.\n\n## Confessions\n\nThe Confessions, a set of documents created by the Protestant churches, laid out a more moderate and ecumenical vision of Christianity.\n\n## Royal Reformation in Scandinavia\n\nThe Royal Reformation in Scandinavia, led by King Christian III, sought to create a more centralized and Lutheran state in Denmark and Norway.\n\n# Catholic reform\n\n## Beginnings\n\nThe Catholic Church's response to the Reformation was to launch a series of reforms, including the creation of new religious orders and the calling of the Council of Trent.\n\n## New Orders\n\nThe Council of Trent created a number of new religious orders, including the Jesuits, who were dedicated to the reform of the Church and the conversion of heretics.\n\n## Council of Trent\n\nThe Council of Trent, a major ecumenical council, sought to reform the Church and respond to the criticisms of the Protestant movement.\n\n# New waves\n\n## English reformation under Henry VIII\n\nThe English Reformation, led by Henry VIII, sought to create a more centralized and Anglican state in England.\n\n## Münster\n\nThe Anabaptist movement in Münster, a city in Germany, sought to create a more radical and communal form of Christianity.\n\n## Calvin and the Institutes of the Christian Religion\n\nJohn Calvin's Institutes of the Christian Religion laid out a more systematic and theological vision of Christianity.\n\n## Reformation in Britain\n\nThe Reformation in Britain, led by Calvin and the Presbyterians, sought to create a more reformed and Presbyterian church in Scotland and England.\n\n## Servetus and the Restoration of Christianity\n\nMichael Servetus, a Spanish theologian, sought to create a more radical and ecumenical form of Christianity, emphasizing the importance of adult baptism and the rejection of the state.\n\n# Wars of religion and tolerance\n\n## Schmalkaldic Wars\n\nThe Schmalkaldic Wars, a series of conflicts in Germany, were sparked by the Reformation and the growing sense of social and economic discontent among the population.\n\n## French Wars of Religion\n\nThe French Wars of Religion, a series of conflicts in France, were sparked by the Reformation and the growing sense of social and economic discontent among the population.\n\n## Revolt in the Netherlands\n\nThe Revolt in the Netherlands, a

the Polish king, Stephen Báthory, sought to promote tolerance and religious freedom in Poland.\n\n## Counter-Reformation and regional conflicts\n\nThe Counter-Reformation, a Catholic response to the

They were a prominent and influential people in the region, known for their fierce warriors, advanced engineering skills, and complex social hierarchy.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe name \"Samnites\" is derived from the Greek word \"Σαμνίτης\" (Samnites), which was used by the ancient Greeks to refer to the people of Samnium. The name is also mentioned in the works of the Roman historian Livy, who wrote extensively about the Samnites and their wars with the Romans.\n\n**History**\n\n### Origins and early history\n\nThe Samnites are believed to have originated from the Italic tribes that lived in the region of Samnium, which was located in the Apennine Mountains of southern Italy. The exact timing of their emergence is not known, but it is believed to have occurred sometime in the 6th or 5th century BCE. The Samnites were a semi-nomadic people who lived in a series of small towns and villages, which were often fortified with walls and towers. They were skilled farmers and herders, and their economy was based on a combination of agriculture and pastoralism.\n\n### Samnite Wars\n\nThe Samnites were a major power in the region of southern Italy, and they frequently clashed with the Romans, who were expanding their territory. The first Samnite War (343-341 BCE) was a major conflict between the two powers, which ended with the defeat of the Samnites. However, the Samnites continued to resist Roman rule, and the Second Samnite War (327-304 BCE) was even more intense. The Samnites were eventually defeated by the Romans, and their territory was incorporated into the Roman Republic.\n\n### Later history\n\nAfter the Samnite Wars, the Samnites continued to live in the region of Samnium, but they were no longer a major power. They were often at odds with the Romans, who continued to expand their territory. In the 1st century BCE, the Samnites were involved in the Social War, which was a major conflict between the Roman aristocracy and the common people. The Samnites were allied with the Roman common people, but they were ultimately defeated by the Roman aristocracy.\n\n**Society**\n\n### Economy\n\nThe Samnite economy was based on a combination of agriculture and pastoralism. They were skilled farmers and herders, and their economy was based on a combination of crops such as wheat, barley, and olives, as well as livestock such as sheep, goats, and cattle. The Samnites were also known for their advanced engineering skills, and they were involved in the construction of roads, bridges, and other public works.\n\n### Government\n\nThe Samnite government was a complex system of councils and assemblies. The highest authority was the Council of Elders, which was composed of the most respected and experienced members of society. The Council of Elders was responsible for making major decisions, such as declaring war or establishing alliances. The Samnites also had a system of assemblies, which were composed of representatives from each town and village. The assemblies were responsible for making decisions on local matters, such as taxation and public works.\n\n### Military\n\nThe Samnite military was known for its bravery and discipline. The Samnites were skilled warriors who were trained from a young age in the art of war. They were equipped with a combination of armor and weaponry, including shields, swords, and spears. The Samnites were also known for their advanced engineering skills, and they were involved in the construction of fortifications and other military infrastructure.\n\n#### Armor\n\nThe Samnite armor was made of a combination of leather and metal. The most common type of armor was the \"galea,\" which was a helmet made of bronze or iron. The Samnites also wore a combination of breastplates, greaves, and shields to protect themselves from enemy attacks.\n\n#### Weaponry\n\nThe Samnite weaponry was a combination of swords, spears, and bows. The most common type of sword was the \"gladius,\" which was a short, narrow sword made of iron or bronze. The Samnites also used spears and bows to attack their enemies.\n\n**Culture**\n\n### Religion\n\nThe Samnites had a complex system of religion, which was based on a combination of polytheism and animism. They worshiped a combination of gods and goddesses, including Jupiter, Mars, and Diana. The Samnites also believed in the concept of \"numina,\" which referred to the spiritual energy that was believed to reside in all living things.\n\n### Gender roles\n\nThe Samnites had a complex system of gender roles, which were based on a combination of patriarchal and matriarchal traditions. Men were responsible for warfare, agriculture, and trade, while women were responsible for domestic duties, such as cooking and childcare. However, women also played a significant role in the Samnite economy, and they were often involved in the management of family businesses.\n\n### Art\n\nThe Samnites were skilled artists who created a variety of works, including paintings, sculptures, and pottery. Their art was influenced by a combination of Greek and Etruscan styles, and they were known for their use of bright colors and intricate designs.\n\n### Clothing\n\nThe Samnites wore a combination of clothing styles, including tunics, cloaks, and sandals. Their clothing was often made of wool or linen, and they used a variety of dyes to create bright colors.\n\n### Recreation\n\nThe Samnites were known for their love of sports and games, including wrestling, boxing, and chariot racing. They also enjoyed playing musical instruments, such as the lyre and the flute.\n\n### Cities and engineering\n\nThe Samnites were skilled engineers who constructed a variety of cities and public works, including roads, bridges, and fortifications. Their cities were often built on hills or mountains, and they used a combination of stone and brick to construct their buildings.\n\n**Notable Samnites**\n\n### Leaders of the Samnites\n\n* Gaius Pontius, a Samnite leader who was involved in the First Samnite War\n* Gaius Papius Mutilus, a Samnite leader who was involved in the Social War\n* Pontius Telesinus, a Samnite leader who was involved in the Social War\n\n### Social War leaders\n\n* Gaius Marius, a Roman leader who allied with the Samnites during the Social War\n* Gaius Flavius Fimbria, a Roman leader who fought against the Samnites during the Social War\n\n### Romans of Samnite origin\n\n* Gaius Octavius, a Roman senator who was of Samnite origin\n* Gaius Fabius Maximus, a Roman general who was of Samnite origin\n\n### Catholic Popes\n\n* Pope Gregory I, a Catholic Pope who was of Samnite origin", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The search was part of a larger investigation into the handling of classified documents by former President Donald Trump.\n\nBackground\n\nHandling, storage, and disposition of U.S. government records\n\nThe U.S. government has strict regulations and guidelines for the handling, storage, and disposition of classified and unclassified documents. The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) is responsible for overseeing the records of the federal government, including those of the President.\n\nCriminal laws listed on search warrant\n\nThe search warrant obtained by the FBI listed several federal laws that were allegedly violated, including:\n\n* 18 U.S.C. § 793(e): Gathering, transmitting, or losing defense information\n* 18 U.S.C. § 793(f): Wrongfully causing to be conveyed or leaving national defense information\n* 18 U.S.C. § 2071: Concealment, removal, or mutilation generally\n* 18 U.S.C. § 1519: Destruction, alteration, or falsification of records in federal investigations and bankruptcy\n\nClassified material and the presidency\n\nDeclassification, presidential powers and regulations\n\nThe President of the United States has the authority to declassify national security information, but there are procedures and guidelines that must be followed. The President can declassify information by either explicitly stating that it is declassified or by taking other actions that would make it declassified.\n\nProtocols for loss or compromise of classified material\n\nIn the event of a loss or compromise of classified material, the government has protocols in place to investigate and address the situation. These protocols include notifying affected parties, conducting an investigation, and taking steps to prevent future losses.\n\nEvents leading to the search\n\nNARA actions to retrieve presidential records from Mar-a-Lago\n\nIn January 2022, the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) sent a letter to former President Trump, requesting that he return any presidential records that were in his possession. The letter stated that NARA had received reports that Trump was storing presidential records at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nPartial return of records to NARA\n\nIn February 2022, Trump returned 15 boxes of records to NARA.

The fort played a significant role in the early history of New York and the Dutch West India Company, which established the colony of New Netherland in 1624. Over the course of its history, the fort changed hands multiple times, serving under Dutch, English, and American rule.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nFort Amsterdam was a strategic military outpost that served as the center of the Dutch West India Company's operations in New Netherland. The fort's history is closely tied to the development of the colony, which began in 1624 when the Dutch West India Company sent a group of settlers to establish a trading post on Manhattan Island. The fort's commanding position on the island made it a crucial location for the Dutch, who sought to establish a foothold in the region and trade with the local Native American tribes.\n\n**Establishment (1621–1660)**\n\nThe first recorded mention of a fort on Manhattan Island dates back to 1621, when the Dutch West India Company established a trading post on the island. This early fort was likely a simple wooden palisade, constructed to protect the company's traders and workers from potential threats from Native American tribes. Over the next several decades, the fort was expanded and fortified, with the addition of stone walls and a moat. By the mid-1630s, the fort had become a significant military outpost, with a garrison of Dutch soldiers and a commander appointed by the West India Company.\n\n**English rule (1664–1673)**\n\nIn 1664, the English took control of New Netherland, including Fort Amsterdam, from the Dutch. The English renamed the colony New York, after the Duke of York, later King James II. During this period, the fort underwent significant renovations, with the addition of new walls and a larger garrison. The English also established a new government in the colony, with a governor and a council appointed by the British monarch.\n\n**Dutch rule (1673–1674)**\n\nIn 1673, the Dutch recaptured New York, including Fort Amsterdam, from the English. This brief period of Dutch rule is often referred to as the \"Dutch reconquest.\" During this time, the fort was restored to its original Dutch layout, with the addition of new walls and a larger garrison. However, this period of Dutch rule was short-lived, as the English regained control of the colony in 1674.\n\n**English rule (1674–1689)**\n\nThe English regained control of New York, including Fort Amsterdam, in 1674. During this period, the fort underwent significant renovations, with the addition of new walls and a larger garrison. The English also established a new government in the colony, with a governor and a council appointed by the British monarch. In the late 1670s, the English built a new fort, Fort William, near the present-day site of the Brooklyn Bridge. This new fort was designed to protect the colony from potential threats from Native American tribes and French colonists.\n\n**Colonist rule (1689–1691)**\n\nIn 1689, the English crown granted a charter to a group of colonial investors, known as the Province of New York, to govern the colony. During this period, the fort was under the command of the colonial governor, who was responsible for maintaining order and defending the colony against external threats. However, the colonial government was often at odds with the English crown, which led to a series of disputes over taxation and governance.\n\n**British rule (1691–1775)**\n\nIn 1691, the English crown revoked the charter of the Province of New York and reasserted its control over the colony. During this period, the fort was under the command of a British governor, who was responsible for maintaining order and defending the colony against external threats. The British also established a new government in the colony, with a governor and a council appointed by the British monarch.\n\n**Prelude to the revolution**\n\nIn the years leading up to the American Revolution, tensions between the British government and the American colonies increased. The British government imposed a series of taxes on the colonies, which led to widespread protests and boycotts. The fort was a key location for British military forces, which were deployed to quell the growing unrest in the colonies.\n\n**Colonist rule (1775–1776)**\n\nIn 1775, the American Revolution began with the Battles of Lexington and Concord. The Continental Army, led by George Washington, besieged the fort in 1776, leading to its capture by the colonists. The fort was renamed Fort George, and it served as the headquarters of the Continental Army during the early years of the war.\n\n**British rule (1776–1783)**\n\nThe British regained control of the fort in 1776, but they were forced to evacuate the colony in 1783, following the signing of the Treaty of Paris, which ended the American Revolution. The fort was abandoned, and it fell into disrepair.\n\n**American rule (1783–1790)**\n\nThe Americans retook control of the fort in 1783, following the signing of the Treaty of Paris. The fort was renovated and expanded, and it served as a military outpost and a customs house. However, the fort was eventually abandoned, and it was replaced by the United States Custom House, which was built in 1790.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Fort William\n* Fort George\n* New York City in the American Revolution\n* American Revolution\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The history of Fort Amsterdam is closely tied to the development of the colony of New Netherland and the American Revolution.\n* The fort played a significant role in the early history of New York, serving as a military outpost and a center of government.\n* The fort changed hands multiple times, serving under Dutch, English, and American rule.\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n* Further reading:\n\n* \"New York in the American Revolution\" by Richard M.
