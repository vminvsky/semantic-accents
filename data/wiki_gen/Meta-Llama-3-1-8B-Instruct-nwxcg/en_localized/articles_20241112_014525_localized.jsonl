The operation began on 6 September 2022 and marked a significant turning point in the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine began on 24 February 2022, with the initial objective of capturing the capital city, Kyiv. However, the invasion was met with fierce resistance from Ukrainian forces, and the advance was eventually halted. As the war shifted to the Donbas region, Russian forces established a strong foothold in the Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian military launched a series of counterattacks in the Kharkiv Oblast, which had been relatively quiet since the early stages of the war.\n\n**Prelude**\n\nIn late August 2022, Ukrainian forces were preparing for a major counterattack in the Kharkiv Oblast. Intelligence suggested that Russian forces were overstretched and weakened, providing an opportunity for a decisive blow. The Ukrainian military launched a series of reconnaissance missions and artillery strikes against Russian positions, weakening their defenses and creating an opening for the counterattack.\n\n**Counteroffensive**\n\nThe Ukrainian counteroffensive began on 6 September 2022, with a series of coordinated attacks against Russian forces in the Kharkiv Oblast.\n\n#### First phase (6–12 September 2022)\n\n##### Initial Advance\n\nThe Ukrainian advance began with a series of artillery and missile strikes against Russian positions, followed by a ground assault by Ukrainian forces. The initial advance was slow but steady, with Ukrainian troops pushing forward against weakened Russian defenses.\n\n##### Breakthrough\n\nOn 7 September 2022, Ukrainian forces broke through the Russian defenses at the village of Izium, a strategic location that controlled access to the Oskil River. This breakthrough marked a significant turning point in the operation, as Ukrainian troops began to pour through the gap and push Russian forces back.\n\n##### Russian withdrawal from Kharkiv Oblast west of Oskil River\n\nOver the next few days, Russian forces retreated from the Kharkiv Oblast, fleeing west of the Oskil River. Ukrainian troops pursued, capturing key locations and infrastructure. The Russian withdrawal was disorderly, with many troops abandoning their equipment and supplies.\n\n##### Other gains and casualties\n\nDuring the first phase of the operation, Ukrainian forces gained significant territory, including the city of Kupiansk and the village of Balakliia. However, the operation was not without cost, with both sides suffering significant casualties. Ukrainian forces reported over 1,000 killed or wounded, while Russian forces suffered an estimated 2,000-3,000 casualties.\n\n#### Battle of Shevchenkove\n\nOn 10 September 2022, Ukrainian forces launched a major assault against the village of Shevchenkove, which was held by Russian forces. The battle was fierce, with both sides suffering heavy casualties. Eventually, Ukrainian forces emerged victorious, capturing the village and pushing Russian forces back.\n\n#### Second phase (13 September–1 October 2022)\n\n##### Oskil River crossing\n\nOn 13 September 2022, Ukrainian forces launched a major operation to cross the Oskil River, which marked the final obstacle between them and the Russian-occupied Luhansk Oblast. The crossing was successful, with Ukrainian troops establishing a foothold on the eastern bank of the river.\n\n##### Encirclement and recapture of Lyman\n\nOver the next few days, Ukrainian forces encircled and recaptured the city of Lyman, a strategic location that controlled access to the Donbas region. The recapture of Lyman marked a significant turning point in the operation, as Ukrainian troops began to push Russian forces back across the Donbas.\n\n**Reactions**\n\nThe 2022 Kharkiv counteroffensive sparked a range of reactions from both Russia and the international community.\n\n#### Russia\n\nThe Russian government responded to the counteroffensive with a mix of denial and anger. Russian officials claimed that the operation was a \"myth\" and that Ukrainian forces had suffered significant losses. However, satellite imagery and eyewitness accounts suggested that Russian forces had indeed been driven back, and that Ukrainian troops had made significant gains.\n\n#### Worldwide\n\nThe international community responded to the counteroffensive with a mix of surprise and concern. Western governments, including the United States and the United Kingdom, praised the bravery and determination of Ukrainian forces. However, some governments, including those in China and India, called for a ceasefire and negotiations.\n\n**Aftermath of the first phase**\n\nThe first", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The rebellion was led by Yevgeny Prigozhin, the founder and leader of the Wagner Group, a private military company (PMC) that has been involved in various conflicts in the Middle East and Africa.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Yevgeny Prigozhin and the Wagner Group\n\nYevgeny Prigozhin is a Russian businessman and military commander who has been involved in various military conflicts over the years. He founded the Wagner Group in 2014, and the company quickly became known for its involvement in the conflict in eastern Ukraine. The Wagner Group has also been involved in other conflicts, including in Syria and Libya.\n\n### Internal tensions during the invasion of Ukraine\n\nIn 2022, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and the Wagner Group was involved in the conflict. However, tensions began to rise within the group as some members became increasingly frustrated with the Russian government's handling of the conflict. Prigozhin and other members of the group began to speak out against the government's strategy, and some even questioned the leadership of the Russian military.\n\n### Order to integrate Wagner\n\nIn June 2023, the Russian government issued an order to integrate the Wagner Group into the Russian military. However, Prigozhin and his followers were opposed to this move, and they saw it as an attempt to undermine their independence and autonomy.\n\n### Planning the rebellion\n\nOver the next few weeks, tensions continued to rise within the group, and Prigozhin and his followers began to make plans for a rebellion. They saw the integration order as a threat to their very existence, and they were determined to resist it.\n\n**Rebellion**\n\n### Prigozhin's statements\n\nOn June 23, 2023, Prigozhin issued a statement criticizing the Russian government and accusing it of planning to attack the Wagner Group. He also called on his followers to prepare for a rebellion, saying that they would not be integrated into the Russian military.\n\n### Rebukes of the government and allegation of an attack on Wagner\n\nIn the days that followed, Prigozhin and his followers continued to issue statements criticizing the government and accusing it of planning to attack them. They also claimed that the government was trying to undermine their independence and autonomy.\n\n### Call to rebellion\n\nOn June 24, 2023, Prigozhin issued a call to rebellion, urging his followers to rise up against the government. He claimed that the government was trying to destroy the Wagner Group, and that they had no choice but to resist.\n\n**Capture of Rostov-on-Don**\n\nOn June 25, 2023, Prigozhin and his followers launched a rebellion against the government, capturing the city of Rostov-on-Don. The city is a major transportation hub, and its capture gave the rebels control of a significant part of southern Russia.\n\n**Advance towards Moscow**\n\nOver the next few days, the rebels advanced towards Moscow, capturing several key cities and towns along the way. The government responded with force, launching airstrikes and sending troops to try and contain the rebellion.\n\n**Security measures**\n\nThe government took several security measures to try and contain the rebellion, including imposing a state of emergency and deploying troops to the affected areas. However, the rebels continued to advance, and the government was forced to scramble to respond.\n\n**Events in Syria**\n\nMeanwhile, the rebellion had significant implications for the conflict in Syria. The Wagner Group had been involved in the conflict in Syria, and the rebellion raised concerns about the potential for a wider conflict.\n\n**Resolution**\n\nOn June 28, 2023, Prigozhin and his followers announced that they had reached a deal with the government to end the rebellion. The deal included a promise to integrate the Wagner Group into the Russian military, but also gave the group significant autonomy and independence.\n\n**Reactions**\n\n### Domestic\n\nVladimir Putin, the President of Russia, issued a statement calling for calm and urging the rebels to end their rebellion. Other government-aligned figures also spoke out against the rebellion, calling it a threat to national security.\n\n### Anti-war opposition and anti-government armed groups\n\nThe rebellion was also welcomed by some anti-war opposition groups and anti-government armed groups, who saw it as an opportunity to challenge the government's authority.\n\n### Ultranationalists and milbloggers\n\nSome ultranationalists and milbloggers also spoke out in support of the rebellion, calling it a necessary step to defend Russian interests.\n\n### Wider public\n\nThe rebellion sparked widespread debate and discussion in Russia, with many people expressing their opinions on social media and in public forums.\n\n**International**\n\nThe rebellion also had significant implications for international relations, with several countries issuing statements condemning the violence and calling for a peaceful resolution.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\n### Fallout and restoring order\n\nThe aftermath of the rebellion saw a significant crackdown on the Wagner Group and its leadership. Many of its members were arrested or forced to flee the country, and the group's infrastructure was dismantled.\n\n### Subsequent statements\n\nPrigozhin and his followers continued to issue statements, claiming that they had been betrayed by the government and that the rebellion had been a necessary step to defend their rights.\n\n### Fate of the Wagner Group and Yevgeny Prigozhin\n\nThe fate of the Wagner Group and its leadership remained uncertain in the aftermath of the rebellion. Prigozhin was reported to have been killed in a car accident, and Utkin, the group's second-in-command, was also reported to have been killed.\n\n### Closure of criminal case and initial statements\n\nThe Russian government announced that it had closed the criminal case against Prigozhin, and that he had been killed in a car accident. The government also issued several statements condemning the rebellion and calling for calm.\n\n### Crackdown on Wagner, alleged purges and related arrests\n\nThe government launched a crackdown on the Wagner Group, arresting or forcing many of its members to flee the country. The group's infrastructure was dismantled, and many of its leaders were killed or captured.\n\n### Prigozhin's return to Russia\n\nPrigozhin's return to Russia was met with widespread controversy, with many people accusing him of being a traitor and a threat to national security.\n\n### Death of Prigozhin and Utkin\n\nPrigozhin and Utkin were both reported to have been killed in the aftermath of the rebellion, although the exact circumstances of their deaths remain unclear.\n\n**Measures of NATO countries**\n\nSeveral NATO countries issued statements condemning the violence and calling for a peaceful resolution. The alliance also announced that it would be increasing its military presence in the region.\n\n**Analysis**\n\n### Political\n\nThe rebellion highlighted significant tensions within the Russian government and military, and raised concerns about the potential for further conflict. The government's response to the rebellion was widely criticized, and many accused it of using excessive force.\n\n### Military\n\nThe rebellion also highlighted significant weaknesses in the Russian military, and raised concerns about its ability to respond to future threats.

Nonmetals are typically found in the upper right corner of the periodic table, and include elements such as carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and fluorine. Nonmetals are a diverse group of elements, and exhibit a wide range of properties and behaviors.\n\n**Definition and Applicable Elements**\n\nThe term \"nonmetal\" was first introduced in the late 19th century, and was used to describe elements that did not fit into the traditional categories of metals and metalloids. Today, the term is widely used in chemistry and physics to describe a broad range of elements that do not exhibit the characteristic properties of metals. Nonmetals include elements such as carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, chlorine, and the noble gases, as well as some of the halogen elements.\n\n**General Properties**\n\n### Physical\n\nNonmetals are typically insulators, meaning that they do not conduct electricity or heat well. They are also often brittle and have a low melting point. Many nonmetals are gases at room temperature, while others are liquids or solids.\n\n#### Allotropes\n\nSome nonmetals, such as carbon and oxygen, exist in multiple allotropes, which are different physical forms of the same element. For example, carbon can exist as diamond, graphite, or fullerenes, while oxygen can exist as ozone or singlet oxygen.\n\n### Chemical\n\nNonmetals are often highly reactive, and can form compounds with many other elements. They tend to gain or share electrons to form ions or molecules, and often exhibit a strong tendency to form covalent bonds.\n\n#### Complications\n\nThe properties of nonmetals can be complex and difficult to predict, due to the variety of compounds they can form and the many different allotropes they can exist in.\n\n#### First Row Anomaly\n\nThe first row of the periodic table, which includes elements such as hydrogen, helium, and lithium, exhibits some unusual properties that do not fit with the expected trends. For example, hydrogen is a nonmetal that can form compounds with metals, while helium is a noble gas that does not react with other elements.\n\n#### Secondary Periodicity\n\nSome nonmetals exhibit secondary periodicity, which is a pattern of properties and behaviors that occur in a periodic fashion as the atomic number increases. For example, the electronegativity of nonmetals tends to increase as the atomic number increases.\n\n#### Higher Oxidation States\n\nSome nonmetals can exhibit higher oxidation states than expected, which can be due to the presence of multiple bonds or the formation of complex ions.\n\n#### Multiple Bond Formation\n\nNonmetals can form multiple bonds with other elements, which can result in the formation of complex molecules with a wide range of properties.\n\n#### Property Overlaps\n\nSome nonmetals exhibit overlapping properties, such as the ability to conduct electricity or heat, which can be due to the presence of defects or impurities in the material.\n\n**Types**\n\nNonmetals can be classified into several different types, including noble gases, halogen nonmetals, and unclassified nonmetals.\n\n### Noble Gases\n\nThe noble gases, which include elements such as helium, neon, and argon, are a group of nonmetals that do not react with other elements. They are highly stable and unreactive, and are often used in applications such as light bulbs and lasers.\n\n### Halogen Nonmetals\n\nThe halogen nonmetals, which include elements such as fluorine, chlorine, and bromine, are a group of nonmetals that are highly reactive and tend to form compounds with other elements. They are often used in applications such as disinfectants and pharmaceuticals.\n\n### Unclassified Nonmetals\n\nThe unclassified nonmetals, which include elements such as carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, are a group of nonmetals that do not fit into the other categories. They exhibit a wide range of properties and behaviors, and are often used in applications such as fuels and fertilizers.\n\n**Abundance, Extraction, and Uses**\n\n### Abundance\n\nNonmetals are found in a variety of sources, including the Earth's crust, oceans, and atmosphere. They are often extracted from minerals and ores, and can be purified using a variety of methods.\n\n### Extraction\n\nThe extraction of nonmetals can be complex and difficult, due to the variety of sources and the need to separate the element from other impurities.\n\n### Uses\n\nNonmetals have a wide range of uses, including applications in fuels, fertilizers, pharmaceuticals, and electronics.\n\n**Taxonomical History**\n\n### Background\n\nThe classification of nonmetals has a long history, dating back to the early days of chemistry. The first attempts to classify the elements were based on their properties and behaviors, and were often disorganized and inconsistent.\n\n### Organization of Elements by Types\n\nThe modern classification of nonmetals is based on the periodic table, which is organized into a series of rows and columns that reflect the properties and behaviors of the elements.\n\n### Development of Types\n\nThe development of the periodic table was a gradual process that involved the work of many scientists over several centuries. The first periodic table was developed by Dmitri Mendeleev in the late 19th century, and was based on the properties and behaviors of the elements.\n\n### Suggested Distinguishing Criteria\n\nThe suggested distinguishing criteria for nonmetals include the ability to conduct electricity or heat, the presence of multiple bonds, and the formation of complex ions.\n\n**Comparison of Selected Properties**\n\n### Physical Properties by Element Type\n\nThe physical properties of nonmetals can vary widely, depending on the element and its allotrope. For example, carbon can exist as diamond, which is a hard and brittle material, or as graphite, which is a soft and slippery material.\n\n### Chemical Properties by Element Type\n\nThe chemical properties of nonmetals can also vary widely, depending on the element and its allotrope. For example, fluorine is a highly reactive gas that can form compounds with many other elements, while helium is a noble gas that does not react with other elements.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Periodic table\n* Noble gases\n* Halogen nonmetals\n* Unclassified nonmetals\n* Allotropes\n* Electronegativity\n* Oxidation states\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The classification of nonmetals is a complex and ongoing process, and there is ongoing debate and discussion among scientists about the best way to categorize these elements.\n* The properties and behaviors of nonmetals can be difficult to predict, due to the variety of allotropes and the many different compounds they can form.\n\n**References**\n\n* This article has been written based on a variety of sources, including scientific journals, textbooks, and online resources.\n* Some of the sources used in the preparation of this article include:\n\t+ \"Chemistry: An Atoms First Approach\" by Steven S.

The film is a sequel to the 2018 film Meg, based on the novel The Megalodon by Steve Alten.\n\nPlot\n\nThe film takes place four years after the events of the first movie. Jonas Taylor (Jason Statham), a deep-sea rescue diver, is once again recruited by the Chinese government to lead a team of experts to the Mariana Trench, the deepest point in the ocean. The government has detected a massive tremor in the trench, which they believe could be a sign of a new, even larger megalodon attack.\n\nAs Jonas and his team descend into the trench, they soon discover that the tremor is caused by a massive, prehistoric creature that has been awakened by human activity. The creature, a gargantuan apex predator, is revealed to be a Rehmannia, a species of deep-sea shark that is even larger and more powerful than the megalodon.\n\nAs the team navigates the treacherous waters of the trench, they soon realize that the Rehmannia is not just a mindless beast, but a highly intelligent and territorial creature that is determined to protect its territory from the humans who have invaded its domain.\n\nCast\n\n* Jason Statham as Jonas Taylor\n* Li Bingbing as Suyin Zhang\n* Rainn Wilson as Jack Morris\n* Ruby Rose as Jaxx Herd\n* Page Kennedy as DJ\n* Jessica McNamee as Lisa Nguyen\n* Ólafur Darri Ólafsson as The Wall\n* Cliff Curtis as James \"Mac\" Mackreides\n* Byron Mann as Toshi\n* Winston Chao as Dr. Minway Zhang\n* Sophia Cai as Meiying\n\nProduction\n\nDevelopment\n\nThe idea for a sequel to Meg was first conceived by producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura and screenwriter Dean Davis, who had been working on the script for the first film.

The film's score was composed by Marco Beltrami and Marcus Trumpp.\n\nMusic\n\nThe film's score was composed by Marco Beltrami and Marcus Trumpp, who incorporated a range of musical styles and influences to create a unique and memorable soundtrack. The score features a mix of electronic and orchestral elements, with a focus on creating a sense of tension and suspense.\n\nRelease\n\nHome media\n\nMeg 2: The Trench was released on digital platforms in March 2023, with a physical release on DVD and Blu-ray following in April 2023.\n\nReception\n\nBox office\n\nMeg 2: The Trench premiered on March 10, 2023, and opened at number one at the box office, with a worldwide gross of over $100 million in its opening weekend.

The series of silkscreen prints depicts Campbell's soup cans, a ubiquitous consumer product in the United States. This article explores the history and significance of Campbell's Soup Cans, from its creation and premiere to its impact on the art world and popular culture.\n\n**Early career**\n\n**New York art scene**\n\nAndy Warhol, born in 1928 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, moved to New York City in the 1940s to pursue a career in commercial art. He quickly established himself as a successful illustrator, working for major magazines and advertising agencies. Warhol's early work was characterized by its glamour and sophistication, earning him a reputation as a leading artist in the New York art scene.\n\n**Pop art**\n\nAs Warhol's career progressed, he became increasingly interested in the emerging pop art movement. Pop art, which focused on the banality and ubiquity of consumer culture, resonated with Warhol's fascination with the mundane and the everyday. Warhol's work began to shift towards a more experimental and avant-garde style, incorporating elements of pop art's irreverent and playful approach.\n\n**Premiere**\n\nIn 1962, Warhol created the first Campbell's Soup Cans print, which would become the iconic image of the series. The print, titled \"Campbell's Soup Cans,\" featured a bold, silkscreen image of a Campbell's soup can against a bright red background. Warhol's use of silkscreen printing allowed him to produce multiple identical prints, emphasizing the mass-produced and consumerist aspects of the image.\n\n**Subsequent publicity**\n\nThe premiere of Campbell's Soup Cans was met with mixed reactions from the art world. Some critics saw the work as a clever commentary on consumer culture, while others dismissed it as trivial and lacking in artistic merit. Warhol's use of a consumer product as subject matter was seen as a bold statement, highlighting the ubiquity and banality of consumer culture.\n\n**Campbell's Soup Company**\n\n**Can and label history**\n\nCampbell's soup cans have a long and storied history, dating back to the late 19th century. The company, founded by Joseph A. Campbell in 1869, began producing canned soups in the 1890s. The iconic red and white label, designed in the 1890s, became a recognizable trademark for the company. Warhol's use of the Campbell's soup can as subject matter was a nod to the company's long history and the ubiquity of its product.\n\n**Relation to Warhol's art**\n\nCampbell's Soup Cans is often seen as a quintessential example of Warhol's pop art style. The use of a consumer product as subject matter, combined with the bold and repetitive silkscreen print, emphasizes the mass-produced and consumerist aspects of the image. The work also highlights Warhol's fascination with the banality and ubiquity of consumer culture, which became a hallmark of his art.\n\n**Inspiration**\n\n**Artist colleagues**\n\nWarhol's work on Campbell's Soup Cans was influenced by his artist colleagues, including Roy Lichtenstein and Jasper Johns. Both artists were part of the same pop art movement, and their work often explored similar themes of consumer culture and mass production.\n\n**Interpretation**\n\nCampbell's Soup Cans is often interpreted as a commentary on the banality and ubiquity of consumer culture. The use of a consumer product as subject matter, combined with the bold and repetitive silkscreen print, highlights the mass-produced and consumerist aspects of the image. The work also explores the relationship between art and commerce, raising questions about the role of the artist in a consumerist society.\n\n**Variations**\n\n**Campbell's Soup I and Campbell's Soup Cans II**\n\nWarhol created several variations of the Campbell's Soup Cans print, including \"Campbell's Soup I\" and \"Campbell's Soup Cans II.\" These prints featured different color schemes and arrangements of the soup cans, emphasizing the repetitive and mass-produced aspects of the image.\n\n**Colored soup cans**\n\nWarhol also created a series of colored soup cans, featuring different hues of red, blue, and green. These prints emphasized the vibrant and playful aspects of the image, highlighting the ubiquity and banality of consumer culture.\n\n**Unauthorized versions**\n\nIn the 1960s, several unauthorized versions of the Campbell's Soup Cans print were created, often with modified or distorted images of the soup cans. These prints highlighted the adaptability and reproducibility of Warhol's work, emphasizing the mass-produced and consumerist aspects of the image.\n\n**Other variations**\n\nWarhol also created several other variations of the Campbell's Soup Cans print, including prints featuring different sizes and arrangements of the soup cans. These prints emphasized the repetitive and mass-produced aspects of the image, highlighting the ubiquity and banality of consumer culture.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCampbell's Soup Cans is a seminal work by Andy Warhol, created in 1962. The series of silkscreen prints depicts Campbell's soup cans, a ubiquitous consumer product in the United States. The work is often seen as a commentary on the banality and ubiquity of consumer culture, highlighting the mass-produced and consumerist aspects of the image. Warhol's use of a consumer product as subject matter, combined with the bold and repetitive silkscreen print, emphasizes the relationship between art and commerce, raising questions about the role of the artist in a consumerist society.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Andy Warhol\n* Pop art\n* Consumer culture\n* Mass production\n* Replication\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is a comprehensive overview of the Campbell's Soup Cans series, created by Andy Warhol in 1962.\n* The series is often seen as a quintessential example of Warhol's pop art style.\n* The use of a consumer product as subject matter, combined with the bold and repetitive silkscreen print, emphasizes the mass-produced and consumerist aspects of the image.\n\n**References**\n\n* This article does not include any citations or references.\n\n**External links**\n\n* The Andy Warhol Museum\n* The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA)\n* The Metropolitan Museum of Art (The Met)", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The mission was designed to test the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, the Orion spacecraft, and the European Space Agency's (ESA) Service Module, in preparation for future crewed missions. This article provides an overview of the mission profile, background, flight, payloads, media outreach, and other key aspects of the Artemis I mission.\n\n**Mission Profile**\n\nThe Artemis I mission was a critical step in the development of the Artemis program, which aims to establish a sustainable presence on the lunar surface. The mission profile was designed to test the performance of the SLS rocket, Orion spacecraft, and Service Module in space, including the spacecraft's ability to travel to the Moon, enter into lunar orbit, and return to Earth.\n\n**Mission Profile Animation**\n\nAn animation of the Artemis I mission profile was created by NASA to illustrate the spacecraft's trajectory and the various phases of the mission. The animation shows the SLS rocket launching the Orion spacecraft and Service Module into space, followed by the spacecraft's journey to the Moon, lunar orbit, and return to Earth. The animation also highlights the various milestones and events that occurred during the mission, including the spacecraft's entry into lunar orbit and its return to Earth's atmosphere.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Artemis program was initiated in response to the Trump administration's directive to return humans to the Moon by 2025. The program was designed to be a stepping stone for further human exploration of the solar system, with the ultimate goal of establishing a sustainable presence on the lunar surface. The Artemis I mission was the first major milestone in the program, with the goal of testing the SLS rocket, Orion spacecraft, and Service Module in preparation for future crewed missions.\n\n**Ground Testing**\n\nPrior to the launch of the Artemis I mission, the SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft underwent extensive ground testing to ensure their readiness for spaceflight.

Discovery\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery is an American multinational mass media and entertainment conglomerate. It is a result of a merger between WarnerMedia and Discovery, Inc. in 2022.\n\nBackground\n\n### 1923–1979\n\nWarner Bros. was founded in 1923 by four brothers, Harry, Albert, Samuel, and Jack Warner. The company started as a small film production company in Los Angeles, California. Over the years, Warner Bros. grew into a major Hollywood studio, producing some of the most iconic films and television shows of the 20th century, including the first Academy Award-winning film, \"The Jazz Singer,\" in 1927. In the 1950s and 1960s, Warner Bros. became known for its animated films, including the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series.\n\nIn the 1970s, Warner Bros. expanded its operations into television, producing popular shows such as \"The Brady Bunch\" and \"The Six Million Dollar Man.\" The company also began to diversify its operations, investing in cable television and home video distribution.\n\n### 1979–1994\n\nIn 1979, Warner Communications merged with Time Inc. to form Warner Communications, Inc. The company continued to expand its operations into cable television, launching the HBO premium cable network in 1972. In the 1980s, Warner Bros. invested heavily in home video distribution, partnering with companies such as MGM and Columbia Pictures to release popular films and television shows on VHS and LaserDisc.\n\nIn the 1990s, Warner Bros. continued to expand its operations, investing in interactive media and emerging technologies such as CD-ROM and the internet. The company also began to focus more on developing and producing its own content, rather than simply distributing films and television shows from other studios.\n\n### 1996–2019\n\nIn 1996, Time Warner merged with AOL to form AOL Time Warner, a new conglomerate that combined the operations of the two companies. The merger was intended to create a global media giant, but it ultimately proved to be unsuccessful, and the company was split into separate entities in 2009.\n\nIn 2008, Time Warner was acquired by Warner Bros.' parent company, Time Warner, Inc. (now known as WarnerMedia). WarnerMedia continued to invest in its operations, expanding its presence in the television and film industries. The company also began to focus more on developing and producing content for emerging platforms such as Netflix and Hulu.\n\nHistory\n\n### Formation and beginning of operations (2021–2022)\n\nOn March 4, 2021, WarnerMedia announced that it would be merging with Discovery, Inc. to form a new company called Warner Bros. Discovery. The merger was intended to create a global media giant with a combined market value of over $300 billion.\n\nThe new company would be led by David Zaslav, the former CEO of Discovery, Inc., and would have a diverse portfolio of assets, including HBO, Warner Bros. Pictures, Warner Bros. Television, and Discovery's cable networks.\n\nIn May 2021, Warner Bros. Discovery announced that it would be relocating its headquarters from Burbank, California to New York City. The company also announced that it would be investing $1.5 billion in its operations over the next three years, with a focus on developing and producing content for emerging platforms.\n\n### Turnover and cutbacks (2023–present)\n\nIn January 2023, Warner Bros. Discovery announced that it would be undergoing a major restructuring, with the goal of reducing its costs by $3 billion. The company would be eliminating 2,000 jobs and closing several of its studios and offices.\n\nThe restructuring was intended to help the company return to profitability, which had been a challenge since the merger with Discovery, Inc. in 2022. Despite the efforts of the company, its stock price had fallen by over 50% in the months following the merger.\n\nAssets\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery has a diverse portfolio of assets, including:\n\n* Warner Bros. Pictures: One of the largest film studios in the world, producing films such as \"The Dark Knight\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\" trilogy.\n* Warner Bros. Television: A leading producer of television shows, including \"The Big Bang Theory\" and \"Game of Thrones.\"\n* HBO: A premium cable network with a diverse portfolio of original programming, including the hit series \"Game of Thrones\" and \"Westworld.\"\n* Discovery's cable networks: A portfolio of cable networks, including Discovery Channel, Animal Planet, and TLC.\n* Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment: A leading developer and publisher of video games, including the \"Mortal Kombat\" and \"Batman\" franchises.\n\nLeadership\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery is led by a team of experienced executives, including:\n\n* David Zaslav: CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery\n* Ann Sarnoff: Chair and CEO of Warner Bros. Entertainment\n* Casey Bloys: President of HBO and HBO Max\n* Kevin Reilly: President of TBS, TNT, and truTV\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n* Warner Bros.
