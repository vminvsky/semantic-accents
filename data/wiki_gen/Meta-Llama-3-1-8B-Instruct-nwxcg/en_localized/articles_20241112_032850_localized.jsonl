Goyer and written by Goyer and Geoff Johns, based on the DC Comics character of the same name. The film is a part of the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) and stars Ezra Miller as Barry Allen / The Flash.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film follows Barry Allen, a crime scene investigator for the Central City Police Department, who gains superhuman speed after being struck by lightning. With his newfound powers, Barry sets out to stop the Rival, a metahuman who is causing chaos in the city. Along the way, Barry also meets Iris West, a reporter who becomes his love interest, and Joe West, her father and a detective who becomes a mentor to Barry.\n\nAs Barry navigates his new life as a superhero, he also faces the Rival, who is revealed to be Eobard Thawne, a time-traveling villain from the future. Thawne is determined to kill Barry, who he sees as a threat to his own existence. The film culminates in a showdown between Barry and Thawne, with Barry ultimately emerging victorious.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Ezra Miller as Barry Allen / The Flash\n* Kiersey Clemons as Iris West\n* Billy Crudup as Henry Allen\n* Lauren Vélez as Nora Allen\n* Hannibal Buress as Jai West\n* Candice Patton as Iris West (voice)\n* Iris Elba as Cisco Ramon\n* Tom Cavanagh as Harrison Wells\n* Russell Tovey as Ray Palmer\n* Gary Levi as Tracy Brand\n* Tobin Bell as Mr. Blank\n* Emily Blunt as Eobard Thawne\n* Lisa Snugger as Nora Allen (young)\n\n**Production**\n\n#### Development\n\nThe idea for a Flash film has been in development since 2008, when Warner Bros. acquired the rights to the character. In 2013, David S. Goyer was hired to write the script, with Geoff Johns serving as a consultant. The two writers drew inspiration from the comic book series, as well as other DC characters.\n\n#### Early attempts\n\nIn the early 2000s, Warner Bros. attempted to develop a Flash film with various writers and directors. One version, written by John August and directed by Robert Zemeckis, was set in the 1950s and followed a young Barry Allen as he becomes the Flash. However, the project was ultimately abandoned due to budget concerns.\n\n#### DC Extended Universe\n\nIn 2013, Warner Bros. announced plans to develop a DC Extended Universe (DCEU) of films, starting with Man of Steel. The Flash was one of the first films to be announced, with Ezra Miller cast as Barry Allen. The film was intended to be a key part of the DCEU, with other films featuring characters from the same universe.\n\n#### Pre-production\n\nPre-production on the film began in 2013, with Ezra Miller and Kiersey Clemons cast as the leads. The film was initially set to be released in 2015, but was delayed due to the complexity of the story and the challenges of filming with a green screen.\n\n#### Filming\n\nFilming on the film began in April 2014 and wrapped in December of the same year. The film was shot on location in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and used a combination of practical and visual effects to bring the characters to life.\n\n#### Post-production\n\nPost-production on the film took place in 2015, with the film's score composed by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL. The film's editing was handled by David S. Goyer, who worked closely with the film's director, David F. Sandberg.\n\n**Music**\n\nThe film's score was composed by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL, who worked together to create a dynamic and energetic soundtrack. The score features a mix of electronic and orchestral elements, with a focus on percussion and synthesizers. The film's theme, \"Flash,\" was performed by Buckaroo.\n\n**Marketing**\n\nThe film's marketing campaign began in 2015, with the release of a series of trailers and TV spots. The campaign focused on introducing the film's cast, including Ezra Miller and Kiersey Clemons, as well as highlighting the film's action and visual effects. The film's tagline, \"Born to Run,\" was also introduced during this time.\n\n**Release**\n\n#### Theatrical\n\nThe film was released on March 23, 2014, in the United States and received a PG-13 rating from the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) for sequences of sci-fi violence and action. The film was released in 3D and IMAX formats, with a runtime of 119 minutes.\n\n#### Home media\n\nThe film was released on DVD and Blu-ray on May 27, 2014, in the United States. The Blu-ray release included a series of bonus features, including deleted scenes, a making-of documentary, and a commentary track by the film's cast and crew.\n\n**Reception**\n\n#### Box office\n\nThe film was a commercial success, grossing over $160 million worldwide on its opening weekend. The film went on to gross over $300 million worldwide, making it one of the highest-grossing films of 2014.\n\n#### Critical response\n\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics, with some praising the film's visuals and action sequences, while others criticized the film's plot and character development. The film holds a 28% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 231 reviews, with an average rating of 4.8/10. The site's consensus states, \"A visually impressive but narratively messy superhero flick.\"\n\n#### Accolades\n\nThe film was nominated for several awards, including the MTV Movie Award for Best Hero (Ezra Miller) and the Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie: Action. The film's score, composed by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL, was also nominated for several awards, including the Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media.\n\n**Future**\n\nThe film's success paved the way for a sequel, which was released in 2018. The sequel, directed by Andy Muschietti, stars Ezra Miller and Kiersey Clemons reprising their roles as Barry Allen and Iris West. The film follows Barry as he teams up with other superheroes, including Aquaman and Wonder Woman, to stop a threat to the world.\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The film was the first DC Extended Universe film to be released in 3D and IMAX formats.\n* The film's score, composed by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL, was released on CD and digital platforms in 2014.\n* The film's marketing campaign included a series of viral marketing campaigns, including a fake website and social media accounts for the film's villain, Eobard Thawne.\n\n**References**\n\n* \"The Flash (2014)\".

The exercises were sparked by a visit to Taiwan by US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, which was seen as a provocation by the Chinese government.\n\nBackground\n\nIncursions into Taiwan ADIZ\n------------------------\n\nThe 2022 Chinese military exercises around Taiwan began with a series of incursions into Taiwan's Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ). On May 23, 2022, Taiwan reported that 30 PLA aircraft had entered its ADIZ, marking the largest single-day incursion since 2020. The aircraft included fighter jets, bombers, and reconnaissance planes, which flew in a series of formations and conducted simulated attacks on Taiwan's air defenses.\n\nOver the next several days, Taiwan reported additional incursions by PLA aircraft, including another 30 aircraft on May 24 and 20 on May 26. The incursions continued throughout June, with Taiwan reporting multiple daily incursions by PLA aircraft.\n\nEscalation of tensions\n--------------------\n\nThe incursions into Taiwan's ADIZ were accompanied by a significant escalation of tensions between China and the United States. The visit to Taiwan by US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on May 2-3, 2022, was seen by the Chinese government as a provocation and a threat to China's sovereignty. In response, China launched a series of diplomatic and economic countermeasures against the United States, including canceling a meeting between US and Chinese trade officials and imposing new sanctions on several US companies.\n\nThe escalation of tensions was further fueled by the Chinese government's announcement that it would conduct military exercises in the Taiwan Strait in response to Pelosi's visit. The exercises, which began on May 23, included naval and air maneuvers, as well as amphibious landings and simulated attacks on Taiwan's air defenses.\n\nMilitary exercises\n----------------\n\nThe military exercises conducted by the PLA in the Taiwan Strait in May and June 2022 included a range of military operations, including:\n\n*   Naval maneuvers: The PLA Navy conducted a series of naval exercises in the Taiwan Strait, including anti-ship missile launches and amphibious landings.\n*   Air operations: The PLA Air Force conducted a series of air operations, including fighter jet sorties and bomber missions.\n*   Amphibious landings: The PLA conducted amphibious landings on Taiwan's coast, including the use of landing craft and troops.\n*   Simulated attacks: The PLA conducted simulated attacks on Taiwan's air defenses, including missile launches and bombing runs.\n\nReactions\n----------\n\nThe 2022 Chinese military exercises around Taiwan were met with a range of reactions from other countries and international organizations.\n\nJapan\n------\n\nThe Japanese government issued a statement condemning the Chinese military exercises as \"serious provocation\" and called on China to \"exercise self-restraint.\"\n\nNorth Korea\n------------\n\nNorth Korea issued a statement expressing support for China's actions, saying that the United States was \"the root cause\" of the tensions in the region.\n\nRussia\n-------\n\nRussia issued a statement calling for a \"de-escalation\" of tensions in the region and expressing support for China's \"legitimate concerns.\"\n\nUnited States\n--------------\n\nThe United States issued a statement condemning the Chinese military exercises as \"destabilizing\" and calling on China to \"cease its provocative actions.\" The US also deployed a carrier strike group to the region in response to the exercises.\n\nAftermath\n----------\n\nThe 2022 Chinese military exercises around Taiwan had significant implications for regional security and international relations. The exercises demonstrated China's military capabilities and its willingness to use force to protect its interests in the region. The exercises also highlighted the tensions between China and the United States and the need for diplomatic efforts to reduce tensions and prevent conflict.\n\nSee also\n----------\n\n*   Taiwan Strait\n*   People's Liberation Army\n*   Air Defense Identification Zone\n*   Nancy Pelosi\n*   United States-China relations\n*   China-Taiwan relations", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

It marked a significant departure from Spears' previous work, showcasing a more mature and experimental sound.\n\n**Background**\n\nIn the early 2000s, Spears was facing intense media scrutiny and pressure to produce a successful album. Her previous two albums, \"...Baby One More Time\" and \"Oops!... I Did It Again\", had been commercial successes, but Spears felt constrained by the teen pop genre. She began working on \"Barbie\", which would become her most experimental and adult-oriented album to date.\n\nSpears has stated that the album's title, \"Barbie\", was inspired by the iconic fashion doll. She felt that the doll represented a perfect, unattainable beauty standard, and she wanted to explore the contrast between that ideal and her own, more realistic, life. The album's lyrics and music reflected this theme, with Spears addressing topics such as love, relationships, and self-empowerment.\n\n**Production**\n\n\"Barbie\" was produced by a variety of artists and producers, including Max Martin, Rami Yacoub, and Bloodshy & Avant. Spears has stated that she was given creative freedom on the album, and she worked closely with the producers to develop the sound and direction of the project.\n\nThe album's production style was characterized by a more mature and experimental approach, incorporating elements of rock, pop, and electronic music. Spears has cited artists such as Madonna, Janet Jackson, and Prince as influences on the album's sound.\n\n**Release**\n\n\"Barbie\" was released on November 12, 2004, in the United States, followed by international releases in the subsequent weeks. The album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling over 345,000 copies in its first week.\n\n**Singles**\n\n\"Me Against the Music\" was released as the lead single from \"Barbie\" in September 2004. The song featured a more experimental and electronic sound than Spears' previous work, and it peaked at number 3 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart.\n\n\"My Prerogative\" was released as the second single from the album in November 2004. The song was a cover of the Bobby Brown classic, and it peaked at number 7 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart.\n\n\"Do Somethin'\" was released as the third single from the album in March 2005. The song was a more upbeat and dance-oriented track, and it peaked at number 5 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart.\n\n**Best Weekend Ever Edition**\n\nIn 2005, a special \"Best Weekend Ever Edition\" of \"Barbie\" was released, featuring a bonus disc with additional tracks and remixes. The edition was marketed as a limited-time release, and it included a bonus DVD with music videos and behind-the-scenes footage.\n\n**Critical reception**\n\n\"Barbie\" received generally positive reviews from critics, with many praising Spears' growth and experimentation as an artist. The album holds a 66% approval rating on Metacritic, based on 22 reviews.\n\nSome critics praised Spears' willingness to take risks and push the boundaries of her sound, while others felt that the album was too experimental and disjointed. The album's lyrics and themes were also subject to interpretation, with some critics praising Spears' honesty and sincerity, while others felt that the album was too shallow and superficial.\n\n**Commercial performance**\n\n\"Barbie\" was a commercial success, selling over 10 million copies worldwide. The album reached number one on the US Billboard 200 chart, and it was certified triple platinum by the RIAA. The album also reached number one on the UK Albums Chart, and it was certified platinum by the BPI.\n\n**Accolades**\n\n\"Barbie\" was nominated for several awards, including the MTV Video Music Awards and the American Music Awards. Spears also won several awards for her performances on the album, including the Teen Choice Awards and the Billboard Music Awards.\n\n**Track listing**\n\n1. \"Me Against the Music\" (feat.

This age range falls between the millennials, who were born between 1981 and 1996, and Generation Z, who were born between 2013 and 2025.\n\n**Characteristics**\n\nZillennials are a diverse group, and their characteristics can vary widely depending on their individual experiences and backgrounds. However, some common traits and tendencies have been identified among this generation.\n\n### Arts and culture\n\nZillennials are known for their love of art, music, and other creative expressions. They are highly influenced by social media and online platforms, which have made it easier for artists and creatives to share their work with a global audience. This has led to a proliferation of new forms of art and entertainment, such as TikTok and YouTube videos, which are often created and consumed by Zillennials.\n\nZillennials are also highly influenced by social justice movements and activism, which has led to a greater emphasis on diversity, equity, and inclusion in the arts. This has resulted in a more diverse and inclusive cultural landscape, with a greater representation of underrepresented voices and perspectives.\n\n### Economic activity\n\nZillennials are known for their entrepreneurial spirit and their desire to start their own businesses. This is driven by a combination of factors, including the rise of the gig economy, the increasing availability of online tools and platforms, and the growing demand for sustainable and socially responsible products and services.\n\nZillennials are also highly influenced by the sharing economy, which has made it easier for them to access goods and services without having to own them. This has led to a shift away from traditional ownership models and towards more flexible and collaborative approaches to consumption.\n\n### Health\n\nZillennials are highly aware of the importance of health and wellness, and are more likely to prioritize their physical and mental health than previous generations. This is driven by a combination of factors, including the growing awareness of the impact of technology on mental health, the increasing availability of health and wellness products and services, and the rising costs of healthcare.\n\nZillennials are also more likely to seek out alternative forms of healthcare, such as acupuncture, yoga, and meditation, which are seen as more holistic and effective than traditional Western medicine.\n\n### Personal values\n\nZillennials are known for their strong personal values, which are driven by a combination of factors, including their social justice activism, their love of art and creativity, and their desire for sustainability and social responsibility.\n\nZillennials value diversity, equity, and inclusion, and are highly committed to creating a more just and equitable society. They also value creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship, and are highly motivated to start their own businesses and make a positive impact on the world.\n\n### Political activity\n\nZillennials are highly engaged in politics, and are more likely to participate in activism and advocacy than previous generations. This is driven by a combination of factors, including the growing awareness of social justice issues, the increasing availability of online tools and platforms, and the rising costs of healthcare and education.\n\nZillennials are also more likely to support progressive policies and candidates, and are highly committed to creating a more just and equitable society.\n\n### Social life\n\nZillennials are highly social, and are more likely to prioritize their relationships and connections with others than previous generations. This is driven by a combination of factors, including the rise of social media, the growing awareness of mental health, and the increasing availability of online tools and platforms.\n\nZillennials value community and connection, and are highly motivated to build and maintain strong relationships with others. They also value diversity, equity, and inclusion, and are highly committed to creating a more just and equitable society.\n\n### Technology\n\nZillennials are highly influenced by technology, and are more likely to use digital tools and platforms than previous generations. This is driven by a combination of factors, including the growing availability of online tools and platforms, the increasing awareness of the importance of digital literacy, and the rising costs of traditional forms of media.\n\nZillennials value innovation and entrepreneurship, and are highly motivated to create and use new technologies to solve real-world problems and make a positive impact on the world.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Generation Z\n* Millennials\n* Zoomer\n* Social justice movement\n* Activism\n* Entrepreneurship\n* Art and culture\n* Health and wellness\n* Personal values\n* Politics\n* Social life\n* Technology\n\n**References**\n\n(Note: This article does not include any citations or references, as per the requirements.)\n\n**Further reading**\n\n* \"The Zillennial Generation: Understanding the New Generation of Young Adults\" by Dr. Pamela Paul\n* \"The Future of Work: How Zillennials Will Shape the Job Market\" by the World Economic Forum\n* \"The Rise of the Zillennials: How Young Adults Are Redefining Identity and Community\" by the Pew Research Center\n\nThis article provides a comprehensive overview of the Zillennial generation, including their characteristics, values, and behaviors.

Born on February 13, 1944, in Highgate, London, England, he is best known for hosting the tabloid talk show The Jerry Springer Show, which aired from 1991 to 2018. Springer has also had a successful career in law, politics, and broadcasting, making him a household name in the United States.\n\nEarly life\n\nJerry Springer was born to Richard and Margot Springer, a dentist and a homemaker, respectively. His family moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, when he was a child. Springer was an excellent student and graduated from Cincinnati's Withrow High School in 1961. He then attended Tulane University in New Orleans, Louisiana, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science in 1964.\n\nSpringer's interest in politics began at an early age, and he was an active member of the Tulane University chapter of the Young Republicans. This exposure to politics led him to pursue a career in law. Springer earned his Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree from Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law in 1968.\n\nCareer\n\n### Kennedy campaign and early law career\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Springer worked as a lawyer in Cincinnati, specializing in civil rights law.

The show's guests often engaged in physical altercations, and Springer frequently intervened to prevent fights from escalating. Despite the show's often-negative press, it remained a ratings success, airing for 28 seasons and becoming one of the longest-running daytime talk shows in U.S. television history.\n\n#### Judge Jerry (2019–2022)\n\nIn 2019, Springer launched a new show, Judge Jerry, in which he presided over a small-claims court. The show's format allowed Springer to use his judicial experience to mediate disputes between litigants. Judge Jerry was a moderate success, running for two seasons before being cancelled.\n\n#### Other\n\nIn addition to his talk show and judicial experience, Springer has made numerous television appearances, including on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, and Real Time with Bill Maher.

He has two daughters, Katie and Monica.\n\nDeath and legacy\n\nJerry Springer passed away on April 27, 2022, at the age of 78, due to complications from heart disease.

Published in 1605, the book is a significant contribution to the field of art history and iconography, providing a vast collection of images and their descriptions.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe Promptuarium Iconum Insigniorum is a product of the Renaissance humanist ideals, which emphasized the study and revival of classical knowledge. Laffert's work is a testament to the growing interest in art history and the desire to document and understand the visual arts of the past. The book is a treasure trove of information, covering a wide range of subjects, from ancient Greek and Roman art to medieval and Renaissance masterpieces.\n\n**Iconographic bases and authorship**\n\nThe Promptuarium Iconum Insigniorum is based on a thorough examination of existing sources, including ancient texts, medieval manuscripts, and contemporary art. Laffert drew upon his extensive knowledge of classical literature, as well as his expertise in art history and iconography. The book is a culmination of his research, which spanned several decades, and is a reflection of his passion for the subject matter.\n\nLaffert's approach to iconography was pioneering, as he sought to provide a systematic and comprehensive classification of images. He believed that the study of images was essential to understanding the artistic, cultural, and historical contexts in which they were created. The Promptuarium Iconum Insigniorum is a testament to his groundbreaking approach, which laid the foundation for future generations of art historians and iconographers.\n\n**Publication history**\n\nThe Promptuarium Iconum Insigniorum was first published in 1605 by the French printer, Jacques du Puys. The book was a remarkable achievement, considering the limitations of printing technology at the time. The edition consisted of 700 pages, with over 300 illustrations, many of which were engraved by some of the most renowned artists of the day. The publication was an instant success, and subsequent editions were published in 1610, 1620, and 1630.\n\nThe book's popularity can be attributed to its accessibility and comprehensiveness. Laffert's writing style was clear and concise, making the book a valuable resource for scholars, artists, and collectors. The Promptuarium Iconum Insigniorum was widely disseminated throughout Europe, influencing art historical scholarship and shaping the way artists and collectors understood and appreciated the visual arts.\n\n**Reception**\n\nThe Promptuarium Iconum Insigniorum received widespread acclaim upon its publication. Many prominent scholars and artists of the time praised Laffert's work, recognizing its significance and contributions to the field of art history. The book's impact was felt across Europe, as it helped to shape the way artists and collectors understood and appreciated the visual arts.\n\nThe Promptuarium Iconum Insigniorum also had a profound influence on the development of art historical scholarship. Laffert's comprehensive approach to iconography set a new standard for future generations of art historians and iconographers. His work laid the foundation for the study of art history as a distinct discipline, recognizing the importance of visual evidence in understanding cultural and historical contexts.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Guillaume Romain Laffert\n* Art history\n* Iconography\n* Renaissance humanism\n* Classical literature\n* Medieval manuscripts\n* Contemporary art\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The Promptuarium Iconum Insigniorum is a rare and valuable resource for scholars, artists, and collectors.\n* The book's significance extends beyond its historical context, as it continues to influence art historical scholarship and shape our understanding of the visual arts.\n* Laffert's comprehensive approach to iconography paved the way for future generations of art historians and iconographers.\n\n**References**\n\n* None\n\n**External links**\n\n* Promptuarium Iconum Insigniorum (1605 edition) at the Library of Congress\n* Promptuarium Iconum Insigniorum (1610 edition) at the British Library\n* Guillaume Romain Laffert ( biography) at the Dictionary of Art Historians", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The election was the fourth presidential election held in Turkey since the country transitioned from a parliamentary to a presidential system in 2018.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe 2023 election was a direct result of a constitutional amendment passed in 2018, which allowed the President of Turkey to serve two consecutive terms. The amendment was championed by President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who had been in office since 2014. The amendment was ratified by a national referendum in April 2017, and it came into effect on July 9, 2018.\n\n### 2018 Elections\n\nThe 2018 presidential election was the first presidential election held under the new system. It was won by President Erdoğan, who defeated Muharrem İnce of the Republican People's Party (CHP) and Selahattin Demirtaş of the Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP). Erdoğan received 52.6% of the vote, while İnce received 30.6%. The election was marked by controversy, with allegations of election interference and voter suppression.\n\n**Date**\n\nThe 2023 presidential election was originally scheduled to be held on June 18, 2023. However, the election date was changed several times due to a combination of factors.\n\n### Discussion on Snap Elections\n\nThere was widespread speculation that the election would be held earlier than scheduled, potentially in May or June 2023. The speculation was fueled by reports that the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) was seeking to hold a snap election in order to capitalize on a strong economy and a favorable political climate.\n\n### Discussion on Postponing Election Date\n\nHowever, the election date was postponed several times due to a combination of factors. The postponements were attributed to a range of reasons, including a delay in the completion of a new electoral roll, a dispute over the format of the election, and a desire to allow for a longer campaign period.\n\n### Election Calendar\n\nThe final election calendar was released in early May 2023. The calendar showed that the election would be held on May 14, 2023, with a second round to be held on May 21, 2023, if necessary.\n\n**Electoral System**\n\nThe 2023 presidential election was held using a two-round system. The winner of the first round would receive a majority of the vote in order to win the election outright. If no candidate received a majority of the vote, the two candidates with the most votes would advance to a second round, with the winner of the second round declared the winner.\n\n**Candidates**\n\nThere were six candidates in the 2023 presidential election.

He was a strong candidate, with a large following and a strong campaign organization.\n* **Mücahit Özdağ** was the leader of the Future Party. He was a former AKP member who had left the party to form the Future Party. He was a strong candidate, with a good campaign organization and a strong message.\n* **Meral Akşener** was the leader of the Good Party.

He is the second African American to serve on the Court, after Thurgood Marshall. Thomas was born on June 23, 1948, in Pin Point, Georgia. He grew up in a low-income family and was raised by his grandparents after his mother's early death.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nThomas's early life was marked by poverty and hardship. His father, M.C. Thomas, left the family before Clarence's birth, and his mother, Leola Williams Thomas, raised him and his brother until her death when Clarence was just three years old. Thomas's grandparents, Mose and Christine White, then took on the responsibility of raising him and his brother.\n\nThomas attended the all-black Robert Smalls Elementary School in Savannah, Georgia, and later attended the St. Pius X Catholic School. He was an excellent student and was awarded a full scholarship to attend the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts.\n\n**College of the Holy Cross and Yale Law School**\n\nThomas attended the College of the Holy Cross, where he studied philosophy and graduated magna cum laude in 1971. He was the first African American to graduate from the college. After graduating from Holy Cross, Thomas attended Yale Law School, where he earned his Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree in 1974. During his time at Yale, Thomas was awarded a fellowship to work at the New Haven Legal Assistance Association, a community law office that provided free legal services to low-income families.\n\n**Early Legal Career**\n\nAfter graduating from Yale, Thomas worked as an associate at the law firm of Covington & Burling in Washington, D.C. He later served as a staff lawyer for the United States Senate Judiciary Committee, where he worked under Senator Howell Heflin of Alabama. In 1979, Thomas joined the Reagan administration as an assistant to Attorney General William French Smith, where he served until 1981.\n\n**District of Columbia Court of Appeals**\n\nIn 1981, President Ronald Reagan nominated Thomas to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, which was the highest court in the District of Columbia at the time. Thomas's nomination was met with opposition from many civil rights groups, who questioned his conservative views on issues such as affirmative action and women's rights. Despite this opposition, Thomas was confirmed by the Senate in 1981 and served on the court for 10 years.\n\n**Nomination to the Supreme Court**\n\nIn 1991, President George H.W. Bush nominated Thomas to the Supreme Court to replace the retiring Justice Thurgood Marshall. Thomas's nomination was met with controversy, particularly with the allegations of Anita Hill, a former colleague of Thomas's at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). Hill accused Thomas of making unwanted advances and discussing graphic details of pornography with her.\n\n### Second Hearing\n\nIn 1991, the Senate held a second hearing on Thomas's nomination, during which Hill testified about the allegations. Thomas denied the allegations, stating that they were \"completely false\" and \"a subtle form of sexism.\" The Senate ultimately confirmed Thomas's nomination in 1991, with a vote of 52-48.\n\n## Senate votes\n\nThe Senate votes on Thomas's nomination were as follows:\n\n* Cloture: 52-48 (yes votes: 52; no votes: 48)\n* Final confirmation: 52-48 (yes votes: 52; no votes: 48)\n\n**Supreme Court of the United States**\n\nThomas was sworn in as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court on October 23, 1991. He has served on the Court for over 30 years, becoming one of the longest-serving justices in U.S. history.\n\n## Government powers and legal structure\n\nAs a justice, Thomas has written numerous opinions on government powers and legal structure. He has argued that the Constitution grants broad powers to the executive branch, and that the federal government has the authority to regulate many areas of state and local law.\n\n### Court precedent\n\nThomas has been a strong advocate for originalism, a legal theory that holds that the Constitution should be interpreted based on its original meaning at the time of its adoption. He has argued that the Court should rely on precedent only when it is consistent with the original meaning of the Constitution.\n\n### Executive power\n\nThomas has written several opinions on the scope of executive power. In one notable case, Hamdan v. Rumsfeld (2006), he argued that the president's authority to detain and try enemy combatants is not limited by the Geneva Conventions.\n\n### Federalism and states' rights\n\nThomas has also written opinions on federalism and states' rights. In one notable case, Printz v. United States (1997), he argued that the Tenth Amendment prohibits the federal government from requiring state and local law enforcement officers to conduct background checks on gun buyers.\n\n## Individual rights\n\nAs a justice, Thomas has written numerous opinions on individual rights, including freedom of speech, the right to bear arms, and the right to privacy.\n\n### First Amendment\n\nThomas has been a strong advocate for freedom of speech. In one notable case, Hustler Magazine v. Falwell (1988), he argued that the First Amendment protects even the most outrageous forms of speech.\n\n### Second Amendment\n\nThomas has written several opinions on the Second Amendment, which protects the right to bear arms. In one notable case, District of Columbia v. Heller (2008), he argued that the Second Amendment protects an individual's right to possess a firearm for self-defense.\n\n### Fourth Amendment\n\nThomas has also written opinions on the Fourth Amendment, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. In one notable case, United States v. Jones (2012), he argued that the Fourth Amendment protects against warrantless tracking of a person's movements using a GPS device.\n\n### Sixth Amendment\n\nThomas has written several opinions on the Sixth Amendment, which protects the right to a fair trial. In one notable case, Crawford v. Washington (2004), he argued that the Sixth Amendment requires the admission of testimonial evidence only if the witness is available for cross-examination.\n\n### Eighth Amendment\n\nThomas has also written opinions on the Eighth Amendment, which prohibits cruel and unusual punishment. In one notable case, Glossip v. Gross (2015), he argued that the Eighth Amendment prohibits the use of a lethal injection protocol that could cause unnecessary pain.\n\n### Fourteenth Amendment\n\nThomas has written several opinions on the Fourteenth Amendment, which protects individual rights and liberties. In one notable case, Shelby County v. Holder (2013), he argued that the Voting Rights Act of 1965 is unconstitutional because it is based on outdated assumptions about racial disparities in voting.\n\n### Abortion and family planning\n\nThomas has been a strong opponent of abortion and has written several opinions on the issue. In one notable case, Gonzales v. Carhart (2007), he argued that the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 is constitutional because it bans a procedure that is not necessary for a woman's health.\n\n### LGBTQ rights\n\nThomas has also written opinions on LGBTQ rights. In one notable case, United States v. Windsor (2013), he argued that the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) is constitutional because it defines marriage as between a man and a woman.\n\n## Oral arguments\n\nAs a justice, Thomas has participated in numerous oral arguments before the Court. In one notable case, Bush v. Gore (2000), he asked several questions of the lawyer arguing on behalf of the state of Florida, including whether the Florida Supreme Court had the authority to count ballots that had been rejected by the state's ballots.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nThomas is a devout Catholic and has written about the influence of his faith on his jurisprudence. He has also written about the importance of family and has been married to his wife, Ginni, since 1987.\n\n## Family\n\nThomas has two children, Jamal and Maya, from his previous marriage to Kathy Ambush.\n\n## Religion\n\nThomas has been a devout Catholic since childhood and has written about the influence of his faith on his jurisprudence.\n\n## Literary influences\n\nThomas has cited several literary influences, including the works of Aristotle, Cicero, and the Bible.\n\n## Moira Smith allegations\n\nIn 2019, it was reported that Thomas was accused of making unwanted advances on a woman named Moira Smith in the 1990s. Thomas denied the allegations.\n\n## Nondisclosure of finances\n\nIn 2019, it was reported that Thomas had not disclosed his financial information on the Court's financial disclosure forms for several years. Thomas said that he had made a mistake and would rectify the situation.\n\n**Honors and Recognition**\n\nThomas has received numerous honors and recognition for his service on the Court. In 2019, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor in the United States.\n\n**In Popular Culture**\n\nThomas has been the subject of several books and documentaries, including the book \"Clarence Thomas: A Biography\" by Andrew Peyton Thomas and the documentary \"Justice Clarence Thomas: A Life on the Court\" by PBS.\n\n**Writings**\n\nThomas has written several books and articles, including the book \"My Grandfather's Son: A Memoir\" and the article \"Originalism: A Quarter-Century of Debate\" in the Harvard Law Review.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* List of Supreme Court Justices\n* Supreme Court of the United States\n* United States v.

The storm was characterized by heavy snowfall, high winds, and freezing temperatures, resulting in widespread disruptions and impacts across the affected regions.\n\n**#Meteorological history**\n\nThe winter storm developed on December 22, 2022, over the southern Great Plains, where a strong low-pressure system was forming. The system quickly intensified as it moved eastward, eventually becoming a powerful nor'easter. The storm's track and intensity were influenced by a strong jet stream, which allowed it to tap into a large pool of cold air from Canada.\n\nAs the storm moved eastward, it brought heavy snowfall to the Midwest and Northeast, with some areas receiving over a foot of snow in a short period. The storm's strongest winds were focused over the Appalachian Mountains, where gusts reached speeds of over 60 mph. The storm's low pressure center eventually moved offshore, but its effects continued to be felt in the form of freezing temperatures and snow-covered roads.\n\n**#Preparations**\n\nIn anticipation of the storm, various government agencies and organizations issued winter storm warnings and advisories, urging residents to take necessary precautions. Many schools and businesses were closed or delayed, and transportation services were scaled back or suspended.\n\nEmergency management officials in affected states and provinces stockpiled supplies, including food, water, and sand, and deployed crews to clear roads and restore power. Some cities, such as New York City and Boston, implemented snow emergency declarations, which allowed for the suspension of parking rules and the deployment of snow removal teams.\n\n**#Impact**\n\nThe winter storm had a significant impact on several areas, including transportation, energy, and daily life.\n\n###**#Deaths**\n\nThe storm was responsible for at least 20 deaths across the United States and Canada, with many of the fatalities occurring due to vehicle accidents, hypothermia, and heart attacks.\n\n###**#Infrastructure**\n\nThe storm caused widespread disruptions to transportation infrastructure, including:\n\n**#Flight delays and cancellations**\n\nMany flights were delayed or canceled at airports across the affected regions, with some airports experiencing over 1,000 cancellations.\n\n**#Road closures and crashes**\n\nNumerous roads were closed or restricted due to heavy snow and high winds, with many drivers becoming stranded or involved in accidents.\n\n**#Intra-city transit disruptions**\n\nPublic transportation systems, such as buses and subways, were suspended or significantly reduced in many cities, making it difficult for residents to get around.\n\n**#Inter-city train delays and cancellations**\n\nAmtrak and other passenger rail services were severely impacted, with many trains delayed or canceled.\n\n**#Energy emergencies**\n\nSome areas experienced energy emergencies, including power outages and gas shortages, as the storm disrupted energy infrastructure.\n\n**#Power outages**\n\nOver 1 million households lost power at some point during the storm, with many areas experiencing prolonged outages.\n\n###**#Sports**\n\nSeveral sporting events, including NFL and NBA games, were postponed or canceled due to the storm.\n\n###**#Corporate and institutional closures**\n\nMany businesses, including banks and government offices, were closed or delayed, affecting thousands of employees and customers.\n\n###**#Animals**\n\nThe storm had a significant impact on local wildlife, with many animals becoming stranded or displaced due to the heavy snow and cold temperatures.\n\n**#Post-storm cold wave**\n\nFollowing the winter storm, a prolonged cold wave affected the affected regions, with temperatures remaining below freezing for several days. The cold wave had a significant impact on various areas.\n\n###**#Rocky Mountain region**\n\nThe Rocky Mountain region experienced a prolonged cold snap, with temperatures remaining below 0°F (-18°C) for several days.

The bank was founded in 1983 in Santa Clara, California, and it became a major player in the financial services industry, particularly in the technology sector.\n\n# Foundation and early growth\n\nSilicon Valley Bank was founded on October 17, 1983, by Robert Medearis and Bill Bagnoli in Santa Clara, California. The bank started as a small regional bank, providing financial services to the burgeoning technology industry in the Santa Clara Valley. Initially, the bank focused on providing checking and savings accounts, as well as cash management services, to its clients. In the early years, the bank's growth was slow, but it managed to establish itself as a reliable and innovative financial services provider in the region.\n\n## Early leadership and vision\n\nSVB's founders, Robert Medearis and Bill Bagnoli, had a clear vision for the bank. They aimed to provide financial services that catered to the unique needs of the technology industry, which was rapidly growing in the valley. The bank's early leadership team was composed of experienced professionals who shared the founders' vision and were committed to building a bank that was responsive to the needs of its clients. The bank's early success was largely due to the efforts of its leadership team, which included individuals such as Robert Medearis, Bill Bagnoli, and Mark Kaufmann.\n\n## Expansion into new markets\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, SVB began to expand its operations into new markets. The bank opened new branches in cities such as San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York, and it also established relationships with venture capital firms and private equity investors. The bank's expansion into new markets was driven by its desire to provide financial services to a broader range of clients, including venture capital firms and private equity investors.\n\n# Expansion\n\nThroughout the 1990s and 2000s, SVB continued to expand its operations and services. The bank opened new branches in cities such as Chicago, Boston, and Seattle, and it also established relationships with technology and life science companies in Europe and Asia. In 2000, SVB acquired Bank of America's commercial banking business in the San Francisco Bay Area, which further expanded the bank's presence in the region.\n\n## Acquisition of Bank of America's commercial banking business\n\nIn 2000, SVB acquired Bank of America's commercial banking business in the San Francisco Bay Area. The acquisition gave SVB access to a large and established customer base, as well as a significant increase in deposits and assets. The acquisition was a major milestone in the bank's history and marked a significant expansion of its operations in the region.\n\n## Establishment of new business lines\n\nIn the 2000s, SVB established new business lines that catered to the needs of its clients. The bank launched a venture capital and private equity business, which provided financing to venture capital firms and private equity investors. The bank also launched a research and development finance business, which provided financing to technology and life science companies that were conducting research and development activities.\n\n## Expansion into new markets\n\nIn the 2000s, SVB expanded its operations into new markets, including Europe and Asia. The bank opened new branches in cities such as London, Paris, and Tokyo, and it also established relationships with technology and life science companies in these regions.\n\n# Operations in lead-up to collapse\n\nIn the years leading up to its collapse, SVB continued to expand its operations and services. The bank's business model was focused on providing financial services to technology and life science companies, as well as venture capital firms and private equity investors. The bank's facilities were designed to accommodate the needs of its clients, and it had a large team of experienced professionals who were committed to providing high-quality financial services.\n\n## Business model\n\nSVB's business model was focused on providing financial services to technology and life science companies, as well as venture capital firms and private equity investors. The bank's services included checking and savings accounts, cash management, and research and development finance. The bank's business model was designed to be highly profitable, with a focus on generating revenue through interest income and fees.\n\n## Facilities\n\nSVB's facilities were designed to accommodate the needs of its clients. The bank had a large network of branches and offices, which provided a convenient and accessible location for its clients to conduct their banking business. The bank's facilities included state-of-the-art technology, which enabled it to provide high-quality financial services to its clients.\n\n## Affiliations and community involvement\n\nSVB was affiliated with a number of organizations, including the Technology Council of America and the National Venture Capital Association. The bank was also involved in a number of community initiatives, including the Silicon Valley Community Foundation and the San Francisco Bay Area Trails and Open Spaces Coalition.\n\n# Collapse\n\nOn March 10, 2023, SVB announced that it had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The bank's collapse was caused by a combination of factors, including a decline in the value of its investment portfolio and a significant increase in deposit withdrawals. The bank's collapse had a major impact on the technology and life science industries, which had relied heavily on SVB's financial services.\n\n## Causes of collapse\n\nThe causes of SVB's collapse were complex and multifaceted. The bank's investment portfolio had been heavily invested in the technology sector, which had experienced a decline in value in the years leading up to the bank's collapse. Additionally, the bank had experienced a significant increase in deposit withdrawals, which had put a strain on its liquidity.\n\n## Impact of collapse\n\nThe impact of SVB's collapse was felt across the technology and life science industries. Many companies that had relied on SVB's financial services were forced to seek alternative banking relationships, which was a difficult and time-consuming process. The collapse of SVB also had a major impact on the venture capital and private equity industries, which had relied heavily on the bank's financial services.\n\n# References\n\nThis article does not include any citations or references.\n\n# Further reading\n\nFor further reading on Silicon Valley Bank, see:\n\n* \"Silicon Valley Bank: A History\" by the Silicon Valley Bank archives\n* \"The Rise and Fall of Silicon Valley Bank\" by Bloomberg\n* \"Silicon Valley Bank's Collapse: A Timeline\" by Forbes\n\n# External links\n\nSilicon Valley Bank website\nSilicon Valley Bank archives\nSilicon Valley Bank Wikipedia page (archived)", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

From simple wound care to complex operations such as amputations and Caesarean sections, Roman surgeons were able to perform a variety of procedures using a range of tools and techniques. In this article, we will explore the history of surgery in ancient Rome, the tools and techniques used by Roman surgeons, and the various procedures they performed.\n\n**#History**\n\nThe history of surgery in ancient Rome is closely tied to the development of the Roman Empire. As the empire expanded, the need for medical care and surgical procedures increased, leading to the establishment of a number of schools and hospitals throughout the empire. The earliest recorded surgical procedures in ancient Rome date back to the 6th century BCE, when the physician Hippocrates of Cos wrote about the use of surgical techniques to treat a range of conditions.\n\nAs the Roman Empire grew, so did the sophistication of Roman surgery. The Roman physician Galen (129-216 CE) is considered one of the greatest physicians of the ancient world, and his works on surgery and medicine are still studied today. Galen's writings provide valuable insights into the techniques and procedures used by Roman surgeons, including the use of anesthesia, suturing, and the treatment of wounds.\n\n**#Tools**\n\nRoman surgeons used a wide range of tools to perform their procedures, including:\n\n#####Cupping vessels\n\nCupping vessels were used to create suction wounds on the skin, which were believed to draw out \"bad blood\" and promote healing. Cupping vessels were typically made of metal or ceramic and were applied to the skin using a sealant.\n\n#####Chisels and raspatories\n\nChisels and raspatories were used to remove bone and tissue.

The team's home stadium is the Azadi Stadium in Tehran, and their head coach is Carlos Queiroz.\n\n**History**\n\nThe Iran national football team was established in 1941 and has a rich history in international football. The team has participated in several international competitions, including the FIFA World Cup, the Olympic Games, and the AFC Asian Cup.\n\n### Early years\n\nThe team's early years were marked by a lack of success, with their first international match being a 0-0 draw against Afghanistan in 1941. However, in the 1950s and 1960s, the team began to show signs of improvement, with their first major international tournament being the 1951 Asian Games, where they finished third.\n\n### After the Iranian Revolution\n\nAfter the Iranian Revolution in 1979, the team's performance took a hit, with many players defecting to other countries due to the new government's restrictions on foreign travel.

These communities played a significant role in the cultural, economic, and political development of the ancient African civilizations. This article provides an overview of the African Greeks, their history, culture, and legacy.\n\nAncient Egypt\n--------------\n\n### First Historical Colonies\n\nThe earliest recorded Greek presence in Africa dates back to the 7th century BC, when the Greek colony of Naucratis was established in the Nile Delta. Naucratis was a major center of Greek culture and commerce, attracting merchants and traders from all over the Mediterranean. The city's strategic location made it an important hub for trade between Egypt and the rest of the ancient world.\n\n### Hellenistic Times\n\n#### Rule of Alexander the Great (332–323 BC)\n\nFollowing Alexander the Great's conquest of Egypt in 332 BC, Greek culture and language began to spread rapidly throughout the country. Alexander's successors, particularly Ptolemy I Soter, established a Greek dynasty that ruled Egypt for nearly three centuries. During this period, Greek became the language of government, commerce, and culture, and many Egyptians adopted Greek names, customs, and practices.\n\n#### The Ptolemaic Empire (323–30 BC)\n\nUnder the Ptolemies, Egypt experienced a golden age of culture and learning. The city of Alexandria became a center of Greek learning and culture, attracting scholars and philosophers from all over the ancient world. The Ptolemies also built numerous temples, theaters, and other public buildings, many of which were designed by Greek architects.\n\n### Roman and Byzantine Egypt\n\n#### Coptic Greeks\n\nAs the Roman Empire expanded its territories, Greek culture continued to thrive in Egypt. The Coptic Greeks, a community of Egyptian Greeks, emerged during this period. They maintained many Greek customs and traditions while also adopting some Coptic practices. The Coptic Greeks played an important role in the cultural and economic development of Egypt during the Roman and Byzantine periods.\n\nAncient Ethiopia\n----------------\n\n### Axumites of Ethiopia\n\nThe Axumites, a powerful and influential empire that flourished in ancient Ethiopia, had significant cultural and trade exchanges with the Greeks. Axumite merchants and traders traveled extensively throughout the Mediterranean, establishing trade relationships with Greek cities and colonies. The Axumites also adopted some Greek customs and practices, including the use of Greek language and script.\n\n### Abyssinian Greeks\n\nThe Abyssinian Greeks, a community of Greek immigrants and descendants of Greek colonizers, emerged in ancient Ethiopia. They maintained strong cultural and economic ties with the Axumites and other Greek communities in Africa. The Abyssinian Greeks played a significant role in the cultural and economic development of Ethiopia during the Axumite period.\n\nAncient Libya\n-------------\n\n### Libyan Greeks of Cyrenaica\n\nThe Libyan Greeks of Cyrenaica, a region in northwestern Libya, were a community of Greek colonizers and descendants of Greek colonizers. They established a thriving city-state, Cyrene, which became a major center of Greek culture and commerce. The Libyan Greeks of Cyrenaica maintained strong cultural and trade exchanges with other Greek communities in Africa and the Mediterranean.\n\n### Libyan Greek Culture\n\nLibyan Greek culture was a unique blend of Greek and African traditions. The Libyan Greeks adopted some African customs and practices, including the use of traditional African instruments and music. They also developed a distinctive artistic style, characterized by the use of Greek and African motifs.\n\nAncient Nubia\n-------------\n\n### Axumite Subjugation of Nubia\n\nThe Axumites, under the leadership of King Ezana, conquered Nubia in the 4th century AD. During this period, many Nubians adopted Axumite culture and language, including the use of Greek. The Axumites also established a network of trade routes and commercial centers throughout Nubia.\n\n### Nubian Greeks\n\nThe Nubian Greeks, a community of Greek immigrants and descendants of Greek colonizers, emerged in ancient Nubia. They maintained strong cultural and economic ties with the Axumites and other Greek communities in Africa. The Nubian Greeks played a significant role in the cultural and economic development of Nubia during the Axumite period.\n\nIn conclusion, the African Greeks played a significant role in the cultural, economic, and political development of ancient Africa. Their legacy can be seen in the many cultural and artistic traditions that they left behind. The African Greeks were a testament to the power of cultural exchange and the importance of understanding and respecting different cultures.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.
