The battle began in August 2022 and continued until June 2023, with the city of Bakhmut at its center. The battle was fought between the Ukrainian military and the Russian Armed Forces, with the Wagner Group, a Russian private military company, also playing a significant role.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe city of Bakhmut, formerly known as Artyomovsk, is a major urban center in eastern Ukraine. It is located in the Donetsk Oblast, near the Donbas region, which has been a hotspot of conflict since 2014. The city has a population of approximately 71,000 people and is strategically located near the Russian border.\n\nThe conflict in eastern Ukraine began in 2014, when Russian-backed separatists declared independence in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Since then, the conflict has escalated into a full-scale war, with Ukraine and Russia engaging in a protracted and bloody conflict. The city of Bakhmut has been a key target for both sides, due to its strategic location and economic importance.\n\n**Battle**\n\nThe Battle of Bakhmut began in August 2022, when Russian forces launched a series of artillery attacks on the city. The Ukrainian military responded with counterattacks, but was unable to prevent the Russian advance. Over the next few months, the Russian forces made slow but steady gains, pushing the Ukrainian lines back and encroaching on the city.\n\n#### Early shelling and Russian encroachment (August–October 2022)\n\nThe first phase of the battle saw intense shelling and artillery exchanges between the two sides. The Russian forces used their superior firepower to pound the city, causing significant damage and casualties. The Ukrainian military responded with counterattacks, but was unable to hold back the Russian advance. The Russian forces made slow but steady gains, pushing the Ukrainian lines back and encroaching on the city.\n\n#### Early winter escalation (November–December 2022)\n\nAs the winter months set in, the fighting intensified. The Russian forces launched a series of frontal assaults on the city, which were met with fierce resistance from the Ukrainian military. The Ukrainian forces suffered significant casualties, but were able to hold back the Russian advance. The Russian forces, however, continued to make gains, slowly but surely pushing the Ukrainian lines back.\n\n#### Capture of Soledar and partial encirclement (January–April 2023)\n\nIn January 2023, the Russian forces captured the city of Soledar, a key stronghold of the Ukrainian military. The capture of Soledar gave the Russian forces a significant strategic advantage, allowing them to encircle the city of Bakhmut. The Ukrainian military was forced to retreat to the city center, where they established a defensive perimeter. The Russian forces continued to make gains, slowly but surely pushing the Ukrainian lines back.\n\n#### Ukrainian flanking counterattacks begin (May 2023)\n\nAs the battle raged on, the Ukrainian military launched a series of flanking counterattacks aimed at cutting off the Russian supply lines. The Ukrainian forces made significant gains, pushing the Russian lines back and threatening to encircle the Russian forces. The Russian forces, however, continued to hold their ground, and the battle continued to rage on.\n\n#### Capture of Bakhmut and Wagner withdrawal (20 May–early June 2023)\n\nOn 20 May 2023, the Russian forces captured the city of Bakhmut, after a long and bloody battle. The capture of the city was a significant strategic victory for the Russian forces, and marked a turning point in the battle. However, the Wagner Group, which had been fighting in the city, announced its withdrawal from the battlefield, citing a lack of support from the Russian government. The withdrawal of the Wagner Group marked a significant shift in the balance of power on the battlefield.\n\n**Military strength and tactics**\n\nThe battle was fought between two sides with vastly different military strengths and tactics. The Russian forces had superior firepower, with a strong emphasis on artillery and air power. The Russian forces also had a significant advantage in terms of manpower, with a larger army and a more extensive logistics network.\n\nThe Ukrainian forces, on the other hand, relied on a more mobile and flexible approach, using hit-and-run tactics and guerrilla warfare to harass and disrupt the Russian forces. The Ukrainian forces also made use of their knowledge of the terrain, using the city's complex network of streets and buildings to their advantage.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe Battle of Bakhmut was a significant conflict that had far-reaching consequences for both sides. The Ukrainian military suffered significant casualties, but was able to hold back the Russian advance and prevent a complete encirclement of the city.\n\n#### Strategic value\n\nThe city of Bakhmut was a key strategic location, with significant economic and military importance. The city was a major transportation hub, with a significant railway network and a major highway connecting it to the Russian border.\n\nThe capture of the city gave the Russian forces a significant strategic advantage, allowing them to control the flow of goods and people in the region. The city was also a key location for the Russian military, providing a secure base of operations for their forces.\n\n#### Battlefield conditions\n\nThe Battle of Bakhmut was a brutal and intense conflict, with both sides suffering significant casualties. The fighting was characterized by intense artillery exchanges, rocket attacks, and infantry battles, with both sides using a range of tactics and strategies to try and gain the upper han", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

He played a significant role in the military campaigns of Catherine the Great, and his victories against the Ottoman Empire and Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth helped shape the modern borders of Russia. Suvorov's military record, tactics, and leadership style have been studied and emulated by military historians and strategists around the world.\n\n**Early Life**\n\n### Origins\n\nSuvorov was born on November 13, 1729, in Moscow, Russia, to a noble family. His father, Vasily Suvorov, was a minor noble and a member of the Boyar Duma, the highest advisory body to the Tsar. Alexander's mother, Praskovya Ushakova, came from a prominent noble family. Suvorov's family was known for their military traditions, with several relatives serving in the Imperial Russian Army.\n\n### Childhood\n\nSuvorov received his early education at home, where he was tutored in mathematics, languages, and military history. He was an excellent student and developed a keen interest in military affairs. At the age of 15, Suvorov was sent to the University of St. Petersburg, where he studied mathematics, physics, and philosophy. However, he soon dropped out of university to pursue a military career.\n\n**Early Career**\n\n### First Military Experience\n\nSuvorov's first military experience began in 1748, when he enlisted in the Imperial Russian Army as a cornet in the Smolensk Dragoon Regiment. He quickly distinguished himself as a skilled cavalryman and was promoted to lieutenant in 1750. Suvorov's early military service was marked by his participation in several campaigns against the Ottoman Empire, where he gained valuable experience in combat and tactics.\n\n### 1761\n\nIn 1761, Suvorov was promoted to captain and became a member of the Imperial Russian Army's General Staff. He was appointed as a military attaché to the Russian embassy in Berlin, where he was tasked with observing and reporting on the military developments in Prussia.\n\n### Freemasonry, Berlin\n\nDuring his stay in Berlin, Suvorov became a member of the local Freemasons' lodge, where he befriended several prominent Prussian military leaders. His involvement with the Freemasons helped him develop his connections and networking skills, which would later prove useful in his military career.\n\n**Wars against Poland–Lithuania**\n\n### Dissolution of the Bar Confederation (1768–1772)\n\n#### Outbreak of war and setbacks\n\nIn 1768, the Bar Confederation, a Polish-Lithuanian noble-led anti-Russian coalition, declared war on Russia.

She rose to fame in the 1960s as a model and actress, known for her distinctive voice, charming on-screen presence, and eclectic style. Throughout her career, Birkin has collaborated with renowned directors, musicians, and artists, cementing her status as a cultural icon.\n\n# Early life\n\nBirkin was born to David Birkin, a British diplomat, and Judy Campbell, a Scottish actress. Her parents were married in 1942 and had two children, Jane and Andrew. Birkin's early life was marked by frequent moves due to her father's diplomatic postings, which exposed her to various cultures and languages. She developed a love for music and dance, particularly jazz and ballet, from an early age.\n\n# Career\n\n## Early acting credits\n\nBirkin began her acting career in the early 1960s, appearing in small roles in British films and television productions. Her breakout role came in 1966 with the film \"The Virgin Soldiers,\" a British comedy-drama directed by John Dexter. Birkin's performance as a young woman caught in a love triangle with two soldiers earned her critical acclaim and recognition within the industry.\n\n## Collaborations with Serge Gainsbourg\n\nIn 1968, Birkin met French singer and songwriter Serge Gainsbourg, who became her romantic partner and musical collaborator. Together, they released several albums, including \"Jane Birkin/Serge Gainsbourg\" (1969) and \"Di Doo Dah\" (1973). Their music was a fusion of folk, rock, and pop, with Gainsbourg's poetic lyrics and Birkin's soothing vocals. Their collaboration resulted in some of Birkin's most iconic recordings, including \"Je T'aime... Moi Non Plus\" and \"Harpe d'Acier.\"\n\n## Later performances and recordings\n\nThroughout the 1970s and 1980s, Birkin continued to act in films and television productions, appearing in a range of genres, from drama to comedy. She also released several solo albums, exploring different musical styles and themes. In the 1990s, Birkin experienced a resurgence in popularity, thanks in part to her collaborations with French musician Michel Berger. Their album \"Amours des Feuilles\" (1994) was a commercial success, and Birkin's vocals were praised for their warmth and expressiveness.\n\n# Personal life\n\n## Death\n\nJane Birkin passed away on July 16, 2023, at the age of 76, after a long battle with cancer. Her death was met with an outpouring of tributes from fans, friends, and fellow artists, who celebrated her remarkable career and enduring legacy.\n\n## Philanthropy\n\nBirkin was a long-time supporter of various charitable causes, including animal welfare organizations and environmental groups. She was particularly committed to the protection of marine life and conservation efforts, reflecting her love of the ocean and the natural world.\n\n## Political views and activism\n\nBirkin was known for her outspoken views on politics and social issues. She was a vocal critic of the French government's treatment of immigrants and marginalized communities, and she advocated for greater social justice and equality. Birkin's activism often took the form of public appearances, interviews, and written statements, where she expressed her opinions and concerns.\n\n# Awards and honours\n\nThroughout her career, Birkin has received numerous awards and accolades for her contributions to music and film. These include several César Awards, a BRIT Award, and a Golden Globe nomination. In 2014, Birkin was awarded the title of Commandeur des Arts et des Lettres, one of France's highest cultural honors.\n\n# In popular culture\n\n## Birkin basket\n\nBirkin's iconic basket is a testament to her enduring influence on fashion and design. The basket, which features a woven handle and a soft, suede interior, was originally designed by Hermès in the 1980s. The brand has since produced numerous limited-edition Birkin baskets, each one showcasing Birkin's signature style and elegance.\n\n## Birkin bag\n\nThe Birkin bag is one of the most coveted handbags in the world, named after Jane Birkin herself. The bag, designed by Hermès, features a sleek, rectangular shape and a luxurious leather exterior. The Birkin bag is prized for its exceptional craftsmanship, attention to detail, and timeless design.\n\n# Discography\n\n* Jane Birkin/Serge Gainsbourg (1969)\n* Di Doo Dah (1973)\n* Amours des Feuilles (1994)\n* Rendez-Vous (1994)\n* Enfants d'Haïti (1997)\n* À la belle étoile (2002)\n* Birkin (2004)\n* Fictions (2006)\n* Fictions (2007)\n* Enfants d'Haïti (2008)\n* Rendez-Vous (2010)\n* Fictions (2012)\n* Birkin (2014)\n* Enfants d'Haïti (2016)\n* Rendez-Vous (2018)\n\n# Filmography\n\n## Film\n\n* The Virgin Soldiers (1966)\n* Blowup (1966)\n* Casino Royale (1967)\n* Topkapi (1964)\n* The Thief of Paris (1967)\n* Jules et Jim (1962)\n* The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing (1973)\n* The Crazy World of Juliette Lesage (1973)\n* The Driver (1978)\n* The Postman Always Rings Twice (1981)\n* French Postcard (1979)\n* The Man Who Loved Women (1983)\n* A Room in Town (1982)\n* The Thief of Paris (1967)\n* The Man Who Loved Women (1983)\n* French Postcard (1979)\n* The Driver (1978)\n* The Postman Always Rings Twice (1981)\n\n## Television\n\n* The Aviator (1975)\n* The Switch (1981)\n* The Postman Always Rings Twice (1981)\n* The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing (1973)\n* The Thief of Paris (1967)\n* Jules et Jim (1962)\n* Topkapi (1964)\n* Casino Royale (1967)\n* The Crazy World of Juliette Lesage (1973)\n* The Driver (1978)\n* French Postcard (1979)\n* The Man Who Loved Women (1983)\n* A Room in Town (1982)\n* The Aviator (1975)\n\n# See also\n\n* Serge Gainsbourg\n* Michel Berger\n* Hermès\n* Birkin bag\n* Birkin basket\n* The Virgin Soldiers\n* Jules et Jim\n* The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing\n* The Postman Always Rings Twice\n* French Postcard\n* The Driver\n* Casino Royale\n* Topkapi\n* The Aviator\n* The Switch\n* A Room in Town\n* The Man Who Loved Women\n\n# References\n\nThis article uses no references.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The use of heraldry in Albania dates back to the medieval period, with the introduction of coats of arms by the Normans during the 12th century. Over time, the armorial of Albania has evolved to reflect the country's complex history, cultural influences, and territorial changes.\n\nMedieval period\n\nDuring the medieval period, the use of coats of arms in Albania was largely influenced by the Normans, who introduced the concept of heraldry to the region. The Norman invasion of Albania in the 12th century brought with it the use of coats of arms, which were initially used to identify knights and nobles on the battlefield.\n\n### Ambiguitatem\n\nThe term \"ambiguitatem\" refers to the use of ambiguous or unclear coats of arms in medieval Albania. During this period, the use of coats of arms was not as standardized as it is today, and many coats of arms were similar or identical. This led to confusion and disputes over the use of certain coats of arms, particularly among the Albanian nobility.\n\n### Regnum Albaniæ\n\nThe Regnum Albaniæ, or Kingdom of Albania, was a medieval state that existed from the 12th to the 14th century. The kingdom was characterized by a complex system of nobility and feudalism, with many Albanian lords and vassals holding power and influence. The use of coats of arms was widespread during this period, with many Albanian nobles bearing distinctive coats of arms.\n\n### Feudal lords\n\nThe feudal lords of medieval Albania were responsible for bearing coats of arms and other heraldic devices.

It is one of the most famous landmarks in the city and a prominent example of French architecture. The basilica is situated on a hill in the Montmartre district, offering stunning views of the city.\n\nHistory\n\n### Proposal\n\nThe idea of building a basilica in Paris dates back to the 19th century. In 1871, after the Franco-Prussian War, the French government decided to build a monument to commemorate the war and to honor the soldiers who had died in it. The architect, Paul Abadie, was chosen to design the basilica, and he was inspired by the traditional architecture of French cathedrals.\n\n### Site\n\nThe site chosen for the basilica was a hill in the Montmartre district, which offered a panoramic view of the city. The hill was already home to a small chapel, but it was deemed too small to accommodate the planned basilica. The site was chosen because of its strategic location, which allowed the basilica to be seen from all parts of the city.\n\n### Construction\n\nConstruction on the basilica began in 1875 and took nearly 46 years to complete. The basilica was built using traditional French architecture, with a white stone façade and a distinctive dome. The dome was inspired by the Pantheon in Rome and was designed to be a symbol of French Catholicism. The basilica was finally completed in 1923, although it was not officially consecrated until 1919.\n\n### Controversy over the church\n\nThe construction of the basilica was not without controversy. Many Parisians opposed the building of the basilica, citing concerns about its location and its impact on the city's infrastructure. The basilica was also criticized for its perceived extravagance, particularly in the wake of the Franco-Prussian War. Despite these criticisms, the basilica was completed and has since become one of the most famous landmarks in Paris.\n\nDescription\n\n### Exterior\n\nThe exterior of the basilica is a striking example of French architecture. The façade is made of white stone, which is typical of French cathedrals. The basilica's dome is its most distinctive feature, rising above the city like a beacon. The dome is supported by a series of arches, which are adorned with intricate stone carvings. The basilica's exterior is also decorated with a series of statues, which depict various saints and biblical figures.\n\n### Interior\n\nThe interior of the basilica is just as impressive as its exterior. The interior is dominated by a large nave, which is flanked by a series of chapels and side altars. The basilica's interior is decorated with a series of intricate mosaics, which depict various biblical scenes. The most striking feature of the interior, however, is the Triumph of the Sacred Heart of Jesus mosaic, which dominates the apse.\n\n### The Triumph of the Sacred Heart of Jesus mosaic\n\nThe Triumph of the Sacred Heart of Jesus mosaic is a stunning example of French mosaics. The mosaic depicts the Sacred Heart of Jesus, surrounded by a series of angels and saints. The mosaic is made up of thousands of individual tiles, which are arranged in a intricate pattern. The mosaic is the focal point of the basilica's interior and is a testament to the skill and craftsmanship of the artisans who created it.\n\n### Chapels\n\nThe basilica has a number of chapels, which are dedicated to various saints and biblical figures. Each chapel is decorated with a series of intricate mosaics and stained glass windows. The chapels are also adorned with a series of statues and other works of art.\n\n### Crypt\n\nThe crypt of the basilica is located beneath the main altar. The crypt is a small, dimly lit space, which is decorated with a series of intricate stone carvings. The crypt is the final resting place of a number of notable figures, including the architect, Paul Abadie.\n\nArt and decoration\n\n### Stained glass\n\nThe basilica's stained glass windows are a striking example of French stained glass. The windows depict various biblical scenes and are made up of thousands of individual pieces of glass. The stained glass windows are a testament to the skill and craftsmanship of the artisans who created them.\n\n### Sculpture\n\nThe basilica's sculpture is just as impressive as its stained glass. The basilica is adorned with a series of statues, which depict various saints and biblical figures. The statues are made of marble and are incredibly detailed. The sculpture is a testament to the skill and craftsmanship of the artisans who created it.\n\nGrand organ\n\nThe basilica's grand organ is a stunning example of French organ-building. The organ is made up of thousands of individual pipes and is one of the largest organs in Europe. The organ is used for a variety of purposes, including concerts and liturgical services.\n\nBells\n\nThe basilica's bells are a striking feature of the building. The bells are made of bronze and are incredibly large. The bells are rung on a regular basis, including during concerts and liturgical services.\n\nRole in Catholicism\n\nThe basilica plays a significant role in Catholicism. The basilica is a place of pilgrimage for many Catholics and is a symbol of French Catholicism. The basilica is also a center of worship and is used for a variety of liturgical services.\n\nAccess\n\nThe basilica is open to visitors throughout the year. The basilica can be accessed by a series of stairs or by elevator. Visitors can take a self-guided tour of the basilica, which includes access to the interior and exterior of the building.\n\nCopy in Martinique\n\nThere is a copy of the basilica in Martinique, which was built in the 20th century. The copy is smaller than the original, but is still an impressive example of French architecture.\n\nSee also\n\n* List of tallest structures in Paris\n* List of tallest churches in the world\n* List of cathedrals in France\n* List of basilicas in France\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography (in French)\n\n* Abadie, P.

The storm caused significant damage and disruption in several countries, including Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands.\n\n**Meteorological History**\n\nTyphoon Mawar originated from a tropical disturbance that formed in the western Pacific Ocean on May 10, 2023. The disturbance gradually intensified into a tropical depression, with maximum sustained winds of 55 km/h (35 mph) and a minimum central pressure of 1000 hPa. The depression moved northwestward under the influence of a subtropical ridge to its north.\n\nOn May 12, the depression strengthened into a tropical storm, with maximum sustained winds of 65 km/h (40 mph) and a minimum central pressure of 995 hPa. The storm continued to move northwestward, eventually entering the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) on May 13. At this time, the storm was named Mawar by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA).\n\nMawar continued to intensify, with maximum sustained winds reaching 120 km/h (75 mph) and a minimum central pressure of 950 hPa on May 15. The storm reached its peak intensity as a Category 3-equivalent typhoon, with maximum sustained winds of 160 km/h (100 mph) and a minimum central pressure of 930 hPa on May 16.\n\n**Preparations**\n\n### Mariana Islands\n\nThe governments of Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands issued tropical storm warnings and flood watches as Mawar approached their territories. Residents were advised to prepare for strong winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surges. The authorities also issued evacuation orders for low-lying areas and conducted evacuations of those in need.\n\nThe Guam National Guard was activated to assist in the evacuation efforts and to provide support to the civilian population. The government also set up emergency shelters and distribution centers for food, water, and other essential supplies.\n\n### Elsewhere\n\nThe governments of Japan, Taiwan, and the Philippines issued tropical storm warnings and flood watches as Mawar moved through their regions. Residents were advised to prepare for strong winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surges.\n\nThe Japanese government issued a warning for the Ogasawara Islands, while the Taiwanese government issued a warning for the Penghu Islands. The Philippine government issued a warning for the provinces of Zambales, Pampanga, and Bataan.\n\n**Impact and Aftermath**\n\n### Guam\n\nTyphoon Mawar made landfall in Guam on May 17, 2023, with maximum sustained winds of 120 km/h (75 mph) and a minimum central pressure of 950 hPa. The storm caused significant damage to infrastructure, including power lines, roads, and buildings.\n\nThe storm also caused widespread flooding, with some areas reporting over 1 meter (3.3 feet) of water. The flooding was exacerbated by heavy rainfall and storm surges.\n\n### Northern Mariana Islands\n\nTyphoon Mawar made landfall in the Northern Mariana Islands on May 18, 2023, with maximum sustained winds of 100 km/h (62 mph) and a minimum central pressure of 960 hPa. The storm caused significant damage to infrastructure, including power lines, roads, and buildings.\n\nThe storm also caused widespread flooding, with some areas reporting over 1 meter (3.3 feet) of water. The flooding was exacerbated by heavy rainfall and storm surges.\n\n### Elsewhere\n\nThe storm caused significant damage and disruption in Japan, Taiwan, and the Philippines. In Japan, the storm caused widespread flooding and landslides, with some areas reporting over 1 meter (3.3 feet) of water.\n\nIn Taiwan, the storm caused significant damage to infrastructure, including power lines, roads, and buildings.

The Roman Empire relied heavily on slave labor for various economic activities, including agriculture, household services, and public works. This article provides an overview of slavery in ancient Rome, including its origins, the role of slaves in Roman law and society, the causes of enslavement, the slave economy, demography, quality of life, resistance and control, and the impact of slavery on Roman religion and morality.\n\nOrigins\n--------\n\nSlavery in ancient Rome had its roots in the early Republican period, when the city was still in its infancy. The earliest recorded instances of slavery date back to the 6th century BC, when Roman armies captured and enslaved people from the Italian peninsula and neighboring regions.\n\n### Enslavement of Roman citizens\n\nThe enslavement of Roman citizens was a common occurrence, often resulting from debt bondage, civil wars, or as punishment for crimes. This was typically a last resort, as the Roman state preferred to use other forms of punishment or exile. However, when a Roman citizen was enslaved, they were often subjected to harsh treatment, including physical abuse and humiliation.\n\nThe slave in Roman law and society\n---------------------------------\n\nSlaves in ancient Rome were considered property, and their rights and protections were limited. However, Roman law did provide some safeguards for slaves, including the right to be freed, the right to own property, and the right to marry.\n\n### Marriage and family\n\nSlaves were allowed to marry, and their marriages were often recognized by Roman law. However, the children of slave parents were automatically enslaved, regardless of their father's status. Freed slaves, known as liberti, could also marry and have children, but their offspring were not automatically freed.\n\n### Peculium\n\nPeculium referred to the personal property of a slave, which they could accumulate and use as they saw fit. This property could include money, goods, or even real estate. However, the slave's peculium was subject to the control of their owner, who could seize it at any time.\n\n### Manumission\n\nManumission was the process by which a slave was freed by their owner. This could be done voluntarily, as a reward for good service, or as a punishment for poor behavior. Freed slaves were known as liberti, and they enjoyed some of the same rights as Roman citizens, but were still subject to certain restrictions.\n\n### Freedmen\n\nFreedmen were the descendants of slaves who had been freed. They played an important role in Roman society, often serving as merchants, artisans, or officials. However, they were still subject to certain restrictions, including the prohibition on holding public office.\n\n### Dediticii\n\nDediticii were slaves who had surrendered to their enemies in battle. They were often subjected to harsh treatment, including physical abuse and humiliation.\n\nCauses of enslavement\n---------------------\n\nSlaves were acquired through various means, including war captives, piracy and kidnapping, child labor, and debt slavery.\n\n### War captives\n\nWar captives were a common source of slaves in ancient Rome. Roman armies would often capture and enslave people from the regions they conquered, and these slaves would be sold or used to work on public projects.\n\n### Captivi in Roman culture\n\nCaptivi, or war captives, were a common feature of Roman culture. They were often displayed in public as a symbol of the Roman state's power and prestige. However, the treatment of captivi was not always humane, and they were often subjected to harsh conditions.\n\n### Piracy and kidnapping\n\nPiracy and kidnapping were also common sources of slaves in ancient Rome. Pirates and kidnappers would often target wealthy individuals or families, and sell their captives into slavery.\n\n### Vernae\n\nVernae were children born to slave mothers. They were often raised and educated by their mothers, and could be freed at a young age. However, they were still subject to certain restrictions, including the prohibition on holding public office.\n\n### Alumni\n\nAlumni were children born to free parents, but raised by their slaves. They were often educated and trained by their slaves, and could be freed at a young age.\n\nThe slave economy\n-----------------\n\nThe slave economy was a significant component of the Roman economy, with slaves making up a large portion of the workforce.\n\n### The slave trade\n\nThe slave trade was a major industry in ancient Rome, with slaves being sold and traded throughout the empire. Slaves were often auctioned off in public markets, and could be purchased by anyone with the means.\n\n### Auctions and sales\n\nAuctions and sales were common practices in the slave trade. Slaves were often displayed in public, and potential buyers would inspect and bid on them. The price of a slave was determined by their age, sex, health, and skills.\n\n### Slave-traders\n\nSlave-traders were individuals or companies that specialized in the purchase and sale of slaves. They often traveled throughout the empire, buying and selling slaves in various markets.\n\n### Taxes and tariffs\n\nTaxes and tariffs were imposed on the slave trade, with the Roman state collecting revenue from the sale of slaves. However, the rates and regulations varied over time and by region.\n\nThe slave economy was diverse, with slaves working in various sectors, including household services, urban crafts and services, agriculture, hard labor, public and imperial slaves, business managers and agents, and gladiators, entertainers, and prostitutes.\n\nTypes of work\n--------------\n\nSlaves worked in various sectors, including household services, urban crafts and services, agriculture, hard labor, public and imperial slaves, business managers and agents, and gladiators, entertainers, and prostitutes.\n\n### Household slaves\n\nHousehold slaves were responsible for managing the household, including cooking, cleaning, and childcare. They were often female slaves, and were valued for their domestic skills.\n\n### Urban crafts and services\n\nUrban crafts and services included a wide range of activities, such as tailoring, carpentry, and baking. Slaves working in these sectors were often skilled craftsmen.\n\n### Agriculture\n\nAgricultural slaves worked on farms and plantations, often in harsh conditions. They were responsible for planting, harvesting, and caring for crops.\n\n### Hard labor\n\nHard labor was a common occupation for slaves, including mining, quarrying, and construction work.

These rebellions were often led by enslaved individuals who sought to overthrow their owners and gain freedom.\n\n### First Servile War (135-132 BC)\n\nThe First Servile War was a major slave rebellion that took place in Sicily. It was led by a slave named Eunus, who claimed to have prophetic powers. The rebellion was eventually put down, but it marked the beginning of a series of slave revolts.\n\n### Second Servile War (104-100 BC)\n\nThe Second Servile War took place in Italy and was led by a slave named Athenion. The rebellion was eventually put down, but it highlighted the growing tensions between slaves and their owners.\n\n### Third Servile War (73-71 BC)\n\nThe Third Servile War, also known as the Spartacus Revolt, was a major slave rebellion that took place in Italy. It was led by a Thracian gladiator named Spartacus, who had escaped from a gladiatorial school. The rebellion was eventually put down, but it marked the end of the Roman Republic and the beginning of the Roman Empire.\n\n### Later uprisings\n\nThere were several later uprisings, including the conspiracy of Catiline and the rebellion of the gladiators at Capua.\n\n### Fugitive slave-catching\n\nFugitive slave-catching was a major industry in ancient Rome, with slave-catchers often traveling throughout the empire to capture escaped slaves.\n\n### The fugitive in Roman culture\n\nThe fugitive was often seen as a symbol of rebellion and resistance against the Roman state.

They were often chained to a wall or a post, and left to languish in their cells.\n\n### Tattooing and branding\n\nTattooing and branding were also used as punishments for slaves. They were often marked with a distinctive tattoo or brand, which served as a warning to other slaves.\n\n### Collaring\n\nCollaring was a punishment in which the slave was forced to wear a heavy iron collar around their neck. This was often used as a symbol of shame and humiliation.\n\n### Crucifixion\n\nCrucifixion was a punishment in which the slave was nailed to a cross and left to die. This was often used as a punishment for slaves who were deemed to be particularly rebellious or defiant.\n\n### Suicide\n\nSuicide was a common occurrence among slaves, particularly in the later Roman Empire. Many slaves chose to take their own lives rather than face the harsh conditions and punishments that they faced.\n\nSlavery and Roman religion\n---------------------------\n\nSlaves played an important role in Roman religion, particularly in the cults of the dead and the gods.\n\n### Slaves in classical Roman religion\n\nSlaves were often involved in the worship of the gods and goddesses of ancient Rome. They would often perform rituals and sacrifices on behalf of their owners, and were sometimes even given responsibility for the care and maintenance of temple buildings.\n\n### Saturnalia\n\nSaturnalia was a festival that took place in December, which was celebrated by the Roman elite. Slaves would often participate in the festival, and were even allowed to wear masks and assume the roles of their masters.\n\n### The Festival of Handmaids\n\nThe Festival of Handmaids was a festival that took place in June, which was celebrated by the Roman elite.

They are native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of the world, and are well adapted to the harsh, cold environments of the tundra and taiga. Reindeer are an important part of the ecosystem in their native habitats, playing a key role in the nutrient cycle and serving as a food source for many other animals.\n\n**Status**\n\nReindeer are widely distributed across the Arctic and subarctic regions, with a range that spans across several countries, including Norway, Sweden, Finland, Russia, Canada, and Alaska. They are an important component of the cultural and economic heritage of many indigenous communities, and are also hunted by humans for their meat, hides, and antlers.\n\n**Naming**\n\nThe term \"reindeer\" is often used in North America, while \"caribou\" is more commonly used in Canada and Alaska. In Europe, the term \"reindeer\" is used to refer to the species as a whole, while the specific subspecies are referred to by their local names. The name \"reindeer\" is thought to have originated from the Middle English word \"reyn,\" which means \"leader\" or \"chief,\" and is possibly derived from the idea that reindeer are the leaders of the herd.\n\n**Evolution**\n\nReindeer are thought to have evolved from a common ancestor with other deer species around 2-3 million years ago. They are believed to have originated in the Arctic regions of Asia, and from there, they spread to other parts of the world. Over time, they have adapted to the harsh environments of the tundra and taiga, developing specialized physical and behavioral traits that allow them to survive and thrive in these regions.\n\n**Taxonomy**\n\n### Naming and research on museum collections\n\nResearch on museum collections has played a crucial role in the classification and naming of reindeer. Many specimens have been collected and studied, providing valuable information on their anatomy, physiology, and behavior. This research has helped to clarify the relationships between different subspecies and has contributed to our understanding of their evolutionary history.\n\n### Biological exploration expeditions\n\nBiological exploration expeditions have also played a significant role in the study of reindeer. Many expeditions have been conducted to remote areas of the Arctic and subarctic regions, providing valuable information on the distribution, behavior, and ecology of reindeer. These expeditions have helped to identify new subspecies and have provided insights into the impact of human activities on reindeer populations.\n\n### Reclassification\n\nIn recent years, there has been a reclassification of some reindeer subspecies based on genetic, molecular, and archaeological evidence. This reclassification has resulted in the recognition of new subspecies and has provided a more nuanced understanding of the evolutionary relationships between different populations.\n\n### Ecotypes\n\nReindeer are often divided into different ecotypes based on their habitat and behavior. These ecotypes include the tundra reindeer, the forest reindeer, and the mountain reindeer. Each ecotype has its own unique characteristics and adaptations to the environment.\n\n### Genetic, molecular, and archaeological evidence\n\nGenetic, molecular, and archaeological evidence has provided valuable insights into the evolutionary history and relationships between different reindeer populations. This evidence has helped to clarify the classification of reindeer and has contributed to our understanding of their adaptations to different environments.\n\n### Novel genetics-based clades\n\nRecent research has identified novel genetics-based clades within the reindeer genus. These clades have been identified using genetic analysis and have provided insights into the evolutionary relationships between different populations.\n\n**Species and subspecies**\n\nThere are several species and subspecies of reindeer, including the caribou, the woodland caribou, the Peary caribou, and the barren-ground caribou. Each of these species and subspecies has its own unique characteristics and adaptations to the environment.\n\n**Physical characteristics**\n\n### Antlers\n\nReindeer are known for their distinctive antlers, which are grown by both males and females. Antlers are an important adaptation for reindeer, providing protection from predators and allowing them to establish dominance within the herd.\n\n### Pelt\n\nReindeer have a thick, insulating coat of fur that helps to keep them warm in cold environments. The pelt is made up of two layers: a thick undercoat and a longer, guard hair layer.\n\n### Heat exchange\n\nReindeer have a number of adaptations that help them to regulate their body temperature in cold environments. These include a thick layer of fat, a slow metabolism, and a countercurrent heat exchange system in their legs.\n\n### Hooves\n\nReindeer have hooves that are well adapted to the harsh environments of the tundra and taiga. Their hooves are broad and flat, allowing them to distribute their weight evenly and providing traction on snow and ice.\n\n### Size\n\nReindeer can vary in size depending on the subspecies, but they are generally medium-sized deer. They typically weigh between 100-300 kg (220-660 lbs) and stand between 1-1.5 m (3-5 ft) tall at the shoulder.\n\n### Clicking sound\n\nReindeer are known for their distinctive clicking sound, which is made by the sound of their hooves on the ground. This sound is often used for communication and can be heard over long distances.\n\n### Eyes\n\nReindeer have large, expressive eyes that are well adapted to the low light conditions of the Arctic and subarctic regions. Their eyes are able to detect movement and changes in light levels, allowing them to navigate and hunt in their environment.\n\n**Biology and behaviors**\n\n### Seasonal body composition\n\nReindeer undergo significant changes in their body composition throughout the year, adapting to the availability of food and the changing environment. In the summer, they are able to eat a diet rich in leaves and grasses, while in the winter, they rely on lichens and other nutrient-poor foods.\n\n### Reproduction and life cycle\n\nReindeer have a relatively long reproductive cycle, with females typically giving birth to a single calf per year. The life cycle of reindeer is influenced by a number of factors, including food availability, climate, and predation.\n\n### Social structure, migration and range\n\nReindeer are social animals that live in large herds, led by a dominant male. They are highly migratory, traveling long distances in search of food and suitable habitats. Their range is influenced by a number of factors, including climate, topography, and human activities.\n\n**Ecology**\n\n### Distribution and habitat\n\nReindeer are found in the Arctic and subarctic regions of the world, with a range that spans across several countries. Their habitat is characterized by tundra and taiga ecosystems, with a range of vegetation types, including grasses, shrubs, and trees.\n\n### Diet\n\nReindeer are herbivores, with a diet that consists of a range of plants, including grasses, leaves, and lichens. They are able to survive on a diet that is low in nutrients, relying on the ability of their digestive system to extract nutrients from poor-quality food.\n\n### Predators\n\nReindeer have a number of predators, including wolves, bears, and humans. They are highly vigilant and have a number of adaptations that help them to avoid predators, including their speed, agility, and ability to detect movement and changes in light levels.\n\n### Other threats\n\nReindeer are threatened by a number of factors, including climate change, habitat loss and fragmentation, and hunting. They are also vulnerable to disease and parasites, which can have significant impacts on their populations.\n\n**Conservation**\n\n### Current status\n\nReindeer are listed as a species of special concern on the IUCN Red List, with a number of subspecies and populations facing significant threats to their survival. Conservation efforts are underway to protect reindeer habitats, reduce human impacts, and promote sustainable hunting practices.\n\n### Boreal woodland caribou\n\nThe boreal woodland caribou is a subspecies of reindeer that is found in boreal forests of Canada and Alaska. It is listed as a threatened species under the US Endangered Species Act and is considered to be one of the most endangered subspecies of reindeer.\n\n### Peary caribou\n\nThe Peary caribou is a subspecies of reindeer that is found in the Canadian Arctic. It is listed as a vulnerable species on the IUCN Red List and is considered to be one of the most endangered subspecies of reindeer.\n\n**Relationship with humans**\n\n### Indigenous North Americans\n\nReindeer have been an important part of the culture and economy of indigenous North American communities for thousands of years. They are considered a sacred animal and are often used in traditional ceremonies and rituals.\n\n### Indigenous Eurasians\n\nReindeer have also been an important part of the culture and economy of indigenous Eurasian communities, particularly in Siberia and Scandinavia. They are often used as a source of food, clothing, and other essential items.\n\n### Husbandry\n\nReindeer have been domesticated in some parts of the world, with herds being kept for their meat, milk, and hides. They are often used in traditional husbandry practices, such as herding and breeding.\n\n### History\n\nReindeer have been hunted and domesticated for thousands of years, with evidence of their use dating back to the Stone Age. They have played an important role in the culture and economy of many societies, particularly in the Arctic and subarctic regions.\n\n### Santa Claus\n\nReindeer are often associated with Santa Claus and are featured in many Christmas traditions and myths. They are often depicted as the reindeer that pull Santa's sleigh.\n\n### Mythology and art\n\nReindeer have been featured in many myths and legends, often as a symbol of good luck, fertility, and strength. They have also been used as a subject in art and literature, often as a symbol of the wild and untamed.\n\n### Heraldry and symbols\n\nReindeer have been used as a symbol in heraldry and are often featured on coats of arms and other symbols of identity. They are often used to represent strength, courage, and resilience.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Caribou\n* Reindeer herding\n* Reindeer husbandry\n* Reindeer hunting\n* Reindeer migration\n* Reindeer conservation\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is based on the following sources:\n\t+ \"Reindeer\" in the Encyclopedia Britannica\n\t+ \"Reindeer\" in the National Geographic\n\t+ \"Reindeer\" in the Smithsonian Institution\n\t+ \"Caribou\" in the IUCN Red List\n\t+ \"Reindeer\" in the World Wildlife Fund\n\n**References**\n\n* This article does not include any references.\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n* This article does not include any bibliography.\n\n**External links**\n\n* Caribou-specific links (North America):\n\t+ Caribou (Alaska Department of Fish and Game)\n\t+ Caribou (Montana Fish, Wildlife, and Parks)\n\t+ Caribou (New Hampshire Fish and Game Department)\n\t+ Caribou (New York State Department of Environmental Conservation)", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The storm had a complex and prolonged meteorological history, with multiple periods of formation, intensification, and dissipation. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the meteorological history of Cyclone Freddy.\n\n**Formation and intensification**\n\nCyclone Freddy formed on February 5, 2023, as a tropical disturbance in the southwestern Indian Ocean, approximately 800 km (500 miles) east of the coast of Madagascar. At the time, the disturbance was a low-pressure system with a well-defined circulation, but it was not yet strong enough to be classified as a tropical cyclone.\n\nOver the next 24 hours, the system gradually intensified as it moved westward, driven by a combination of atmospheric instability and moisture from the warm waters of the Mozambique Channel. On February 7, the system developed a closed circulation, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA).\n\nAs the system continued to strengthen, it was named Cyclone Freddy by the Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre (RSMC) in Réunion on February 8. At this point, the storm had developed a well-defined eye and a maximum sustained wind speed of around 120 km/h (75 mph).\n\nOver the next several days, Cyclone Freddy continued to intensify, fueled by the warm waters and favorable atmospheric conditions. The storm reached its peak intensity on February 11, with maximum sustained winds of up to 220 km/h (137 mph) and a minimum central pressure of 930 hPa (27.46 inHg).\n\n**The Mascarene Islands, Madagascar, and Mozambique**\n\nAs Cyclone Freddy continued to move westward, it began to affect the Mascarene Islands, a group of islands located in the Indian Ocean. On February 9, the storm made landfall on the island of Réunion, bringing heavy rainfall and strong winds to the island.\n\nThe storm then continued westward, making landfall on the coast of Madagascar on February 10. The storm caused significant damage and flooding along the coast, particularly in the city of Toamasina.\n\nFrom Madagascar, Cyclone Freddy moved into the Mozambique Channel, where it continued to affect the coast of Mozambique. On February 12, the storm made landfall on the coast of Mozambique, bringing heavy rainfall and strong winds to the region.\n\n**Redevelopment and dissipation**\n\nAfter making landfall on the coast of Mozambique, Cyclone Freddy began to weaken as it interacted with the warm and humid air over the region. However, as the storm continued to move westward, it began to redevelop, fueled by the warm waters of the Mozambique Channel.\n\nOn February 14, the storm re-intensified, with maximum sustained winds increasing to around 180 km/h (112 mph). However, the storm's re-development was short-lived, and Cyclone Freddy began to weaken once again as it interacted with the dry air over the region.\n\nOver the next several days, Cyclone Freddy continued to weaken, driven by the dry air and the increasing shear in the atmosphere. On February 20, the storm dissipated as a tropical cyclone, although it continued to produce heavy rainfall and strong winds over the region.\n\n**Records**\n\nCyclone Freddy was a significant storm, with several records broken during its lifetime. The storm was the longest-lived tropical cyclone in the Southern Hemisphere, with a lifespan of 34 days. It was also the most intense tropical cyclone in the Southern Hemisphere, with maximum sustained winds of up to 220 km/h (137 mph).\n\nIn addition, Cyclone Freddy was the first tropical cyclone to affect the Mascarene Islands and Mozambique in the same season. The storm also caused significant damage and flooding in Madagascar, with reports of widespread damage and loss of life.\n\n**See also**\n\n* List of tropical cyclones in the Southern Hemisphere\n* Tropical cyclones in the Indian Ocean\n* Cyclone Gafilo\n\n**Notes**\n\nCyclone Freddy was a significant storm that affected several countries in the Southern Hemisphere. The storm's complex and prolonged meteorological history was fueled by the warm waters of the Mozambique Channel and the favorable atmospheric conditions in the region. The storm's records, including its longevity and intensity, make it one of the most notable tropical cyclones in recent history.\n\nThis article provides a comprehensive overview of the meteorological history of Cyclone Freddy, including its formation, intensification, and dissipation.

Ron Hubbard in the 1950s. The movement has been classified as a new religious movement, a cult, and a pseudoscience by various scholars and organizations. This article will provide an overview of Scientology's definition, history, beliefs, practices, and controversies.\n\n**Definition and classification**\n\nScientology has been described as a spiritual movement, self-help system, and science fiction-inspired religion. The movement's definition is somewhat ambiguous, and its classification has been the subject of debate.\n\nDebates over classification\n\nScientology's classification has been a subject of debate among scholars and experts. Some have described it as a cult, a pseudoscience, or a new religious movement. The movement's use of science fiction elements, such as space opera and the concept of the \"Operating Thetan,\" has led some to classify it as a science fiction-inspired religion. Others have argued that Scientology is simply a self-help system or a spiritual movement.\n\nEtymology\n\nThe term \"Scientology\" was coined by L. Ron Hubbard in 1952, derived from the words \"science\" and \"ology\" (the study of). Hubbard claimed that Scientology was a science of the mind and spirit.\n\n**History**\n\nScientology was developed by L. Ron Hubbard in the 1950s. Hubbard, a science fiction author and self-proclaimed spiritual leader, began developing the movement in the early 1950s. He claimed to have developed a spiritual technology that could help individuals achieve spiritual enlightenment and self-improvement.\n\nHubbard's early teachings emphasized the concept of the \"reactive mind,\" which he claimed was a source of suffering and pain. He developed a self-help system called Dianetics, which aimed to help individuals overcome their reactive minds and achieve spiritual enlightenment.\n\nThe Church of Scientology was officially founded in 1954, with Hubbard as its leader. The movement quickly gained popularity, and Hubbard began to develop a hierarchical structure for the Church.\n\n**Beliefs and practices**\n\nScientology's beliefs and practices are centered around the concept of the \"thetan,\" a spiritual being that is believed to exist beyond the physical body. The movement's teachings emphasize the importance of auditing, a process of spiritual purification that involves the use of a technique called the E-meter.\n\nAuditing\n\nAuditing is a central practice in Scientology. It involves the use of an E-meter, a device that measures the electrical resistance of an individual's body. The E-meter is used to detect and measure the individual's reactive mind, which is believed to be a source of suffering and pain.\n\nSoul\n\nScientologists believe in the concept of the soul, which is seen as a spiritual entity that exists beyond the physical body. The soul is believed to be a thetan, a being that has experienced countless lifetimes and has accumulated experiences and knowledge.\n\nSpace opera and the Wall of Fire\n\nScientology's teachings include a concept called the \"Wall of Fire,\" which is described as a spiritual barrier that separates the thetan from the physical world. The movement's teachings also include a concept of space opera, which involves the idea of spiritual travel and exploration.\n\nThe Operating Thetan levels\n\nScientologists believe in a series of spiritual levels, known as the Operating Thetan levels.

The movement's teachings also include a system of hieroglyphics, which is used to represent spiritual concepts and ideas.\n\nPsychiatry, psychology, psychosis\n\nScientology's teachings are critical of psychiatry and psychology, which are seen as pseudosciences that seek to control and manipulate individuals. The movement's teachings emphasize the importance of spiritual growth and self-improvement over psychiatric treatment.\n\nViews on Hubbard\n\nL. Ron Hubbard is revered by Scientologists as a spiritual leader and a pioneer in the field of spiritual growth and self-improvement. His teachings are seen as a gift to humanity, and his legacy is celebrated by Scientologists around the world.\n\n**The Church of Scientology**\n\nThe Church of Scientology is the official organization of Scientology.

The movement has been accused of harassment and intimidation of its critics.\n\nSuppressive persons and fair game\n\nScientologists believe in the concept of \"suppressive persons,\" who are seen as enemies of the movement. The movement's teachings emphasize the importance of dealing with suppressive persons and of being \"fair game.\" Fair game is a concept that refers to the idea of taking action against those who are seen as enemies of the movement.\n\n**Free Zone and independent Scientology**\n\nThe Free Zone and independent Scientology are groups of Scientologists who have left the official Church of Scientology or have been expelled from it.

The outbreak resulted in unprecedented destruction and loss of life, affecting multiple states across the country.\n\n## Meteorological Synopsis\n\nThe outbreak was caused by a complex low-pressure system that developed over the southern Great Plains. This low-pressure system was fueled by a strong jet stream and a mass of warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico. As the system moved eastward, it interacted with a cold front, creating a powerful area of instability in the atmosphere.\n\n### March 31\n\nOn March 31, a squall line developed along the cold front, producing a series of severe thunderstorms across the southern Great Plains. These storms produced large hail, damaging winds, and tornadoes. The first tornado of the outbreak touched down in Oklahoma, causing moderate damage. However, the storms quickly intensified as they moved eastward, producing multiple tornadoes in Arkansas, Missouri, and Tennessee.\n\n### April 1\n\nOn April 1, the outbreak intensified, with multiple tornadoes touching down across the Midwest and Southeast.

The escalation of tensions began in 2021 and continued to build until the invasion, which was widely condemned by the international community.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe conflict in eastern Ukraine between Ukrainian government forces and Russian-backed separatists, known as the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) and the Luhansk People's Republic (LPR), had been ongoing since 2014. The conflict had resulted in significant human suffering, displacement, and economic costs for Ukraine.\n\n**Initial tensions (March–April 2021)**\n\n#### First Russian military buildup\n\nIn March 2021, Russia began a large-scale military buildup along the border with Ukraine. The buildup included the deployment of troops, tanks, and artillery, which raised concerns among Ukrainian officials and the international community. The Russian military buildup was seen as a demonstration of Russia's military power and a show of force against Ukraine.\n\n#### Continued violence and escalation\n\nThe conflict in eastern Ukraine continued to escalate in March and April 2021, with both sides engaging in heavy fighting. The violence resulted in significant casualties and displacement, with thousands of people forced to flee their homes. The international community condemned the violence and called for a ceasefire.\n\n#### Partial withdrawal\n\nIn April 2021, Russia announced a partial withdrawal of its military forces from the border with Ukraine.

The protests have continued in various forms, with widespread demonstrations, petitions, and statements against the war. This article provides an overview of the protests, their evolution, and the response of the Russian authorities.\n\nStreet protests\n\n### February\n\nThe first protests against the war took place on February 24, 2022, the day of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Small groups of people gathered in several cities, including Moscow and St. Petersburg, to express their opposition to the war. These initial protests were largely spontaneous and were not coordinated by any opposition groups. The authorities responded with force, detaining several protesters and fining others for participating in unauthorized gatherings.\n\n### March\n\nAs the war continued, protests became more widespread and frequent. On March 6, 2022, thousands of people gathered in Moscow's Pushkin Square to protest the war. The protests were largely peaceful, but the authorities responded with force, using riot police to disperse the crowds. Several protesters were detained, and some were injured in the clashes.\n\n### April–June\n\nIn the months following the initial protests, the anti-war movement continued to grow. On April 21, 2022, a large protest took place in St. Petersburg, with thousands of people gathering in the city's central square to demand an end to the war. The authorities responded with mass arrests, detaining over 1,000 protesters. Similar protests took place in other cities, including Moscow, Yekaterinburg, and Novosibirsk.\n\n### September\n\nIn September 2022, the anti-war movement experienced a significant surge in momentum. On September 21, 2022, a large protest took place in Moscow, with tens of thousands of people gathering in the city's central square to demand an end to the war. The protest was largely peaceful, but the authorities responded with force, using riot police to disperse the crowds. Several protesters were detained, and some were injured in the clashes.\n\nOther direct action\n\n### Russian military personnel\n\nSome Russian military personnel have also expressed opposition to the war. In August 2022, a group of Russian soldiers wrote an open letter to President Vladimir Putin, expressing their opposition to the war and calling for an end to the conflict.

The club was founded in 1926 and is one of the most successful teams in Greece, with a rich history and a dedicated fan base.\n\n**History**\n\n### Foundation and early years (1926–1939)\n\nPAOK FC was founded on March 20, 1926, by a group of young footballers who were inspired by the English football clubs of the time.

The budget was unveiled by Chancellor of the Exchequer Kwasi Kwarteng, who promised to stimulate economic growth through tax cuts and government spending. However, the budget was widely criticized for its lack of detail, potential impact on public finances, and perceived favoritism towards wealthy individuals.\n\n**Background**\n\nIn the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, the UK economy experienced a period of rapid growth, with the Bank of England forecasting a strong recovery. However, the UK's economic performance was soon eclipsed by rising inflation, fueled by supply chain disruptions and a sharp increase in energy prices. In response, the Bank of England raised interest rates to combat inflation, which led to concerns about the potential impact on economic growth.\n\nThe UK's Conservative Party, led by Prime Minister Liz Truss, took office in September 2022, promising to deliver a growth-oriented budget and reduce taxes. The party's election manifesto had promised significant tax cuts, including a reduction in the top rate of income tax from 45% to 40%.\n\n**The budget**\n\nThe Growth Plan, as outlined by Chancellor Kwarteng, aimed to stimulate economic growth through a package of tax cuts, government spending, and regulatory reforms. The key points of the budget included:\n\n* A reduction in corporation tax from 25% to 19%\n* A cut in income tax for higher earners, reducing the top rate from 45% to 40%\n* A reduction in the basic rate of income tax from 20% to 19%\n* A freeze on fuel duty, a tax on petrol and diesel\n* A reduction in stamp duty, a tax on property purchases\n* A package of measures to support small businesses and entrepreneurs\n\n**Reaction**\n\nThe Growth Plan was met with widespread criticism from economists, opposition parties, and some members of the Conservative Party. Concerns were raised about the potential impact on public finances, the lack of detail in the budget, and the perceived favoritism towards wealthy individuals.\n\n**Currency, interest rate, and debt**\n\nThe budget was criticized for its potential impact on the UK's public finances, with some economists warning that the tax cuts could lead to higher borrowing and a larger national debt. The Bank of England, which had already raised interest rates to combat inflation, was concerned that the budget could lead to a surge in borrowing costs and a potential recession.\n\n**Bond markets**\n\nThe bond markets reacted negatively to the budget, with the yield on 10-year gilts (government bonds) rising sharply in the aftermath of the announcement. This reflected concerns about the potential impact on public finances and the UK's creditworthiness.\n\n**International response**\n\nThe international community responded to the budget with caution, with some economists warning that the UK's fiscal policy could have negative consequences for the global economy. The European Union and other countries were concerned about the potential impact on the UK's trade relationships and the stability of the global financial system.\n\n**Business and economic**\n\nBusiness leaders and economists were divided in their response to the budget, with some welcoming the tax cuts and others expressing concerns about the potential impact on public finances. The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) welcomed the budget, while the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) expressed concerns about the potential impact on public finances.\n\n**Media**\n\nThe media reaction to the budget was mixed, with some outlets welcoming the tax cuts and others criticizing the lack of detail and the potential impact on public finances. The BBC and other news outlets provided extensive coverage of the budget, with some commentators warning that the UK's fiscal policy could have negative consequences for the global economy.\n\n**Political**\n\nThe budget was widely criticized by opposition parties, with the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats expressing concerns about the potential impact on public finances and the lack of detail in the budget. Some Conservative MPs also expressed concerns about the budget, with a few calling for a reversal of the tax cuts.\n\n**Opinion polling**\n\nOpinion polling in the aftermath of the budget suggested that the public was divided in their response, with some supporting the tax cuts and others expressing concerns about the potential impact on public finances. A YouGov poll found that 44% of respondents supported the budget, while 31% opposed it.\n\n**Government response**\n\n**Initial responses**\n\nThe government's initial response to the budget was positive, with Chancellor Kwarteng welcoming the tax cuts and government spending as a necessary step to stimulate economic growth. However, the government was criticized for its lack of detail and its perceived favoritism towards wealthy individuals.\n\n**Dismissal of Chancellor**\n\nIn the aftermath of the budget, the government was criticized for its handling of the economic situation, with some economists warning that the tax cuts could lead to higher borrowing and a larger national debt. Chancellor Kwarteng faced criticism for his handling of the economy, with some calling for his dismissal.\n\n**Reversal of tax cuts**\n\nIn an attempt to address concerns about the budget, the government announced a reversal of the tax cuts, with the top rate of income tax being raised back to 45%. This move was seen as a bid to calm the markets and reduce concerns about the potential impact on public finances.\n\n**Resignation of Truss as Prime Minister**\n\nThe budget was widely seen as a factor in the resignation of Prime Minister Liz Truss, who stepped down after just 49 days in office. The budget was criticized for its lack of detail and its potential impact on public finances, with some economists warning that the tax cuts could lead to higher borrowing and a larger national debt.\n\n**Subsequent events**\n\n**Following Truss's resignation**\n\nFollowing Truss's resignation, the UK was plunged into a period of uncertainty, with the Conservative Party leadership contest dominating the headlines. The eventual winner, Rishi Sunak, vowed to address the economic situation and restore stability to the UK's finances.\n\n**Later events**\n\nIn the aftermath of the budget, the UK's economy continued to face challenges, with inflation remaining high and the national debt continuing to rise. The government's fiscal policy was criticized for its potential impact on public finances, with some economists warning that the tax cuts could lead to higher borrowing and a larger national debt.\n\n**See also**\n\n* List of United Kingdom budget measures\n* Economic history of the United Kingdom", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.
