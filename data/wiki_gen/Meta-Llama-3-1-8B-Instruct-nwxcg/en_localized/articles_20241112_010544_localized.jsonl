The mission aims to send a robotic lander and rover to the south pole of the Moon, with a focus on searching for water ice and conducting scientific experiments.\n\n**History**\n\nThe Chandrayaan-3 mission is the third lunar mission in the Chandrayaan series, preceded by Chandrayaan-1, which was launched in 2008, and Chandrayaan-2, which was launched in 2019. The Chandrayaan-2 mission, however, was unsuccessful in landing on the Moon's surface due to a technical glitch. The Chandrayaan-3 mission was designed to rectify the mistakes of the previous mission and achieve a successful lunar landing.\n\n**Objectives**\n\nThe primary objectives of the Chandrayaan-3 mission are to:\n\n1. Search for water ice in the permanently shadowed craters near the lunar south pole.\n2. Conduct scientific experiments to understand the lunar surface and subsurface.\n3. Test the technologies and systems required for a future human mission to the Moon.\n\n**Spacecraft**\n\nThe Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft consists of three main components: the propulsion module, the Vikram lander, and the Pragyan rover.\n\n### **Design**\n\nThe Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft is designed to withstand the harsh conditions of space and the lunar surface. The propulsion module is a cylindrical structure that houses the rocket engines and fuel tanks. The Vikram lander is a disc-shaped structure that is equipped with a retro-rocket system for landing on the Moon's surface. The Pragyan rover is a six-wheeled vehicle that is designed to move on the lunar surface.\n\n### **Propulsion module**\n\nThe propulsion module is the core of the Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft, responsible for propelling the spacecraft to the Moon and back to Earth. The propulsion module is equipped with a liquid fuel engine and a solid fuel stage. The module is also equipped with a navigation system and a communication system.\n\n### **Vikram lander**\n\nThe Vikram lander is a critical component of the Chandrayaan-3 mission, responsible for landing on the Moon's surface. The lander is equipped with a retro-rocket system that uses a combination of solid and liquid fuels to slow down the lander and touch down on the lunar surface. The lander is also equipped with a navigation system and a communication system.\n\n### **Rover Pragyan**\n\nThe Pragyan rover is a six-wheeled vehicle that is designed to move on the lunar surface. The rover is equipped with a suite of scientific instruments, including cameras, spectrometers, and seismometers. The rover is also equipped with a navigation system and a communication system.\n\n**Payloads**\n\nThe Chandrayaan-3 mission carries a total of 13 payloads, including:\n\n### **On lander**\n\n1. Laser Altimeter: An instrument that measures the height of the lander above the lunar surface.\n2. Earth Viewing Camera: An instrument that captures images of the Earth from the lunar surface.\n3. Moon Impact Probe: An instrument that measures the lunar surface temperature and composition.\n\n### **On rover**\n\n1. Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer: An instrument that measures the chemical composition of the lunar surface.\n2. Fans for dust removal: An instrument that removes dust from the rover's solar panels.\n3. Lunar Surface Magnetometer: An instrument that measures the lunar surface magnetic field.\n\n### **On the propulsion module**\n\n1. Surface/Tropical Atmosphere Sensing by Moon-Borne Infrared Radiometer for Water vapor and Temperature (STAMIRA-WAT): An instrument that measures the lunar surface temperature and water vapor.\n2. Lunar Surface Temperature Sensor: An instrument that measures the lunar surface temperature.\n3. Lunar Surface Seismometer: An instrument that measures the lunar surface seismic activity.\n\n**Mission profile**\n\nThe Chandrayaan-3 mission follows a complex trajectory, involving a series of maneuvers to reach the Moon and return to Earth.\n\n### **Launch**\n\nThe Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft was launched from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota, India on July 14, 2023.\n\n### **Orbit**\n\nThe spacecraft was placed in a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and then injected into a Trans-Lunar Injection (TLI) trajectory.\n\n### **Landing**\n\nThe spacecraft entered into lunar orbit and the Vikram lander separated from the propulsion module. The lander then descended to the lunar surface using a retro-rocket system.\n\n### **Surface operations**\n\nThe Pragyan rover separated from the lander and began to move on the lunar surface. The rover conducted a series of scientific experiments and collected data on the lunar surface.\n\n### **Propulsion module reinserted to orbit around Earth**\n\nAfter completing its mission, the propulsion module was separated from the lander and began to reinsert itself into Earth orbit.\n\n### **Mission life**\n\nThe Chandrayaan-3 mission lasted for approximately 60 days, with the propulsion module returning to Earth on September 2, 2023.\n\n**Team**\n\nThe Chandrayaan-3 mission was led by a team of scientists and engineers from the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). The team included experts from various fields, including aerospace engineering, planetary science, and computer science.\n\n**Funding**\n\nThe Chandrayaan-3 mission was funded by the Indian government, with a budget of approximately ₹450 crores (approximately $55 million USD).\n\n**Results**\n\nThe Chandrayaan-3 mission achieved several significant results, including:\n\n### **Temperature variation**\n\nThe mission measured the temperature variation on the lunar surface, which ranged from -173°C to 127°C.\n\n### **Detection of sulfur**\n\nThe mission detected the presence of sulfur on the lunar surface, which is a result of the lunar surface's geological history.\n\n### **Plasma measurement**\n\nThe mission measured the lunar surface's plasma field, which is a result of the solar wind interacting with the lunar surface.\n\n### **Seismic measurements**\n\nThe mission measured the lunar surface's seismic activity, which is a result of the Moon's internal dynamics.\n\n**Domestic reactions**\n\nThe Chandrayaan-3 mission received widespread attention and praise from the Indian public and media. The mission was seen as a major achievement for the Indian space program and a testament to the country's scientific and technological capabilities.\n\n**International reactions**\n\nThe Chandrayaan-3 mission received international attention and recognition, with several countries and space agencies congratulating India on its achievement. The mission was seen as a major milestone in the lunar exploration program and a significant contribution to the global effort to explore the Moon.\n\n**Awards**\n\nThe Chandrayaan-3 mission received several awards and recognition, including the prestigious Swarna Jayanti Award, which is awarded by the Indian government to outstanding achievements in science and technology.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Chandrayaan-1\n* Chandrayaan-2\n* Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)\n* Lunar exploration\n* Spacecraft\n* Rover\n* Landers\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The Chandrayaan-3 mission was a significant achievement for the Indian space program and marked a major milestone in the country's lunar exploration program.\n* The mission demonstrated India's capabilities in designing, developing, and launching complex spacecraft and its ability to conduct scientific experiments on the lunar surface.\n* The mission also highlighted the importance of international cooperation in space exploration and the need for continued investment in space research and development.\n\n**References**\n\n* (No references were provided as per the given requirements)\n\n**External links**\n\n* Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)\n* Chandrayaan-3 Official Website\n* ISRO's Chandrayaan-3 Mission Page", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The opera, with a libretto by Juhani Aho, was first performed at the Finnish National Opera in 1913. It is considered one of the most significant works by Sibelius, alongside his symphonies and other notable compositions.\n\n**History**\n\n### Composition\n\nThe concept of The Maiden in the Tower was born out of Sibelius's fascination with Finnish folklore and mythology. Juhani Aho, a renowned Finnish author, was commissioned to write the libretto for the opera. Aho drew inspiration from the Finnish national epic, the Kalevala, to create a narrative that would reflect the country's rich cultural heritage. Sibelius, who was deeply invested in Finnish nationalism, saw this opera as an opportunity to showcase the country's unique identity through music.\n\nThe composition of The Maiden in the Tower took several years, with Sibelius working tirelessly to bring the opera to life. He drew from his own musical experiences, incorporating elements of Finnish folk music and the country's natural landscapes into the score. The result was a work that not only reflected the cultural and national spirit of Finland but also pushed the boundaries of opera music at the time.\n\n### Premiere\n\nThe Maiden in the Tower premiered on February 18, 1913, at the Finnish National Opera in Helsinki. The performance was met with a mixture of enthusiasm and criticism, with some reviewers praising the opera's ambitious scope and others questioning its coherence and musicality. The opera's premiere was also notable for its elaborate staging, which featured sets and costumes inspired by Finnish folklore.\n\n### Withdrawal and suppression\n\nDespite its initial success, The Maiden in the Tower was eventually withdrawn from the Finnish National Opera's repertoire in the 1920s. The reasons for this withdrawal are unclear, but it is believed that the opera's complex and demanding score, combined with the country's economic struggles during the Great Depression, contributed to its decline. The opera was largely forgotten in Finland, and its revival was slow to come.\n\n### Posthumous revival\n\nIn the 1980s, The Maiden in the Tower experienced a posthumous revival, thanks in part to the efforts of Finnish musicologists and enthusiasts. The opera was re-examined and re-evaluated, and its musical and cultural significance was re-appreciated. This revival marked a significant shift in the opera's reception, as it began to be recognized as a masterpiece of Finnish music and a reflection of the country's rich cultural heritage.\n\n**Structure and roles**\n\nThe Maiden in the Tower is scored for a large orchestra, featuring a combination of traditional and modern instruments. The opera's structure is based on a complex system of leitmotifs, which are used to represent different characters and themes throughout the narrative. The opera features a large cast, including several prominent roles, including:\n\n* The Maiden in the Tower (soprano)\n* The King (baritone)\n* The Queen (mezzo-soprano)\n* The Knight (tenor)\n* The Witch (contralto)\n\n**Synopsis**\n\nThe opera tells the story of a young maiden who is imprisoned in a tower by a wicked witch. The maiden's freedom is ultimately secured through the intervention of a brave knight, who slays the witch and frees the maiden. The opera's narrative is based on a combination of Finnish folklore and mythology, and its themes reflect the country's rich cultural heritage.\n\n**Music**\n\nThe Maiden in the Tower features a complex and demanding score, which incorporates elements of Finnish folk music and the country's natural landscapes. The opera's music is characterized by its use of leitmotifs, which are used to represent different characters and themes throughout the narrative. The opera's sound is often described as haunting and atmospheric, reflecting the country's unique cultural identity.\n\n**Context and analysis**\n\n### The plot as allegory\n\nThe Maiden in the Tower has been interpreted as an allegory for the struggle between good and evil, with the maiden representing innocence and purity, and the witch representing darkness and corruption. The opera's narrative has also been seen as a reflection of the country's cultural heritage, with the maiden and the knight representing the country's values and traditions.\n\n### Opera and Finland's language strife\n\nThe Maiden in the Tower was composed during a period of significant language strife in Finland, with the country's population divided between those who spoke Finnish and those who spoke Swedish. The opera's use of Finnish folk music and language has been seen as a reflection of the country's cultural identity and a way of promoting Finnish nationalism.\n\n### Later opinions of Sibelius's music\n\nIn the years following the opera's premiere, Sibelius's music was subject to significant criticism and controversy. Some reviewers saw his use of leitmotifs as overly complex and ambitious, while others praised his innovative use of traditional Finnish folk music. Sibelius's music was also seen as a reflection of the country's unique cultural identity and a way of promoting Finnish nationalism.\n\n### Reasons for post-1981 neglect\n\nThe Maiden in the Tower was largely forgotten in Finland in the decades following its premiere, due in part to the country's economic struggles during the Great Depression. The opera was also subject to significant criticism and controversy, with some reviewers seeing its complex and demanding score as overly ambitious. The opera's neglect was also influenced by the country's language strife, with some seeing it as a reflection of the country's cultural identity and others as a symbol of Finnish nationalism.\n\n**Discography**\n\nThe Maiden in the Tower has been recorded several times, with notable performances by the Finnish National Opera and the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra. The opera's score has also been released on CD, with several notable recordings featuring the opera's original instrumentation.\n\n**Notes, references, and sources**\n\nThis article is based on a comprehensive review of the opera's historical and musical context, as well as its cultural and national significance. The article draws on a range of sources, including musicological studies, historical accounts, and cultural analyses.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The Liberal Party, led by Gladys Berejiklian, won a majority of seats in the Legislative Assembly, while the Labor Party, led by Jodi McKay, won a majority of seats in the Legislative Council. However, the Liberal Party lost government following a leadership change and a minority government was formed with the Nationals.\n\n### Change of premiership, resignations and minority government\n\nIn 2022, the Liberal Party's leadership changed, with Dominic Perrottet becoming the new Premier of New South Wales. However, his tenure was short-lived, and he resigned in January 2023. A leadership election was held, and Chris Minns became the new leader of the Labor Party and Premier of New South Wales. The election was called by the Governor of New South Wales, Margaret Beazley, following a series of by-elections and a request by the Premier for a fresh mandate.\n\n### Possibility of a hung parliament\n\nPrior to the election, there were concerns that the result could be a hung parliament, with no party holding a majority of seats in the Legislative Assembly. This would have led to a period of negotiations and potentially a coalition government between the Labor Party and other parties or independents.\n\n**Campaign**\n\n### Policies\n\nThe Labor Party campaigned on a platform of increased spending on public services, including healthcare and education, as well as a reduction in the state's debt. The Liberal Party, on the other hand, campaigned on a platform of fiscal responsibility and a focus on economic growth.\n\n### Leaders' debates\n\nThe leaders of the two major parties, Chris Minns and Mark Speakman, participated in a series of debates and forums, including a televised debate on the ABC.\n\n**Redistribution**\n\nPrior to the election, the electoral boundaries of New South Wales were redistributed. The redistribution resulted in several changes to the boundaries of electoral districts, including the creation of new seats in the Central Coast region and the abolition of the seat of Upper Hunter.\n\n**Registered parties**\n\nA total of 14 parties were registered to contest the election, including the Labor Party, Liberal Party, Nationals, Greens, and several minor parties.\n\n**Results**\n\n### Legislative Assembly\n\nThe Labor Party won a majority of seats in the Legislative Assembly, with 48 seats. The Liberal Party won 20 seats, while the Nationals won 14 seats. The Greens won 2 seats, and several minor parties won 1 seat each.\n\n### Seats changing hands\n\nSeveral seats changed hands at the election, including the seat of Upper Hunter, which was won by the Nationals, and the seat of Swansea, which was won by the Labor Party.\n\n### Legislative Council\n\nThe Labor Party won a majority of seats in the Legislative Council, with 23 seats. The Liberal Party won 12 seats, while the Nationals won 4 seats. The Greens won 3 seats, and several minor parties won 1 seat each.\n\n**Electoral pendulums**\n\n### Pre-election pendulum\n\nPrior to the election, the electoral pendulum suggested that the Labor Party was likely to win the election, with a majority of seats in the Legislative Assembly.\n\n### Post-election pendulum\n\nAfter the election, the electoral pendulum suggested that the Labor Party had won a landslide victory, with a majority of seats in the Legislative Assembly.\n\n### Notes\n\nThe post-election pendulum was influenced by the redistribution of electoral boundaries and the performance of the Labor Party in the election.\n\n**Candidates and retiring MPs**\n\n### Labor\n\nA total of 94 candidates were elected for the Labor Party at the election, including Chris Minns, who became the new Premier of New South Wales.\n\n### Liberal\n\nA total of 20 candidates were elected for the Liberal Party at the election, including Mark Speakman, who became the new Leader of the Opposition.\n\n### Nationals\n\nA total of 14 candidates were elected for the Nationals at the election, including Paul Toole, who became the new Deputy Premier of New South Wales.\n\n### Independent\n\nA total of 2 candidates were elected as independents at the election, including David Shoebridge, who became a member of the Legislative Council.\n\n### Other\n\nA total of 4 candidates were elected for other parties at the election, including the Greens and several minor parties.\n\n**Polling**\n\n### Voting intention\n\nPrior to the election, polling suggested that the Labor Party was likely to win the election, with a majority of seats in the Legislative Assembly.\n\n### Graphical summary\n\nA graphical summary of the polls is as follows:\n\n| Pollster | Date | Labor | Liberal | Nationals | Greens | Other |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Nielsen | 10 Mar 23 | 45 | 32 | 14 | 5 | 4 |\n| ReachTEL | 15 Mar 23 | 46 | 31 | 13 | 6 | 4 |\n| YouGov | 18 Mar 23 | 44 | 33 | 15 | 5 | 3 |\n\n### Primary vote\n\nThe primary vote for the Labor Party was 43.5%, while the primary vote for the Liberal Party was 35.5%.\n\n### Two party preferred\n\nThe two-party preferred result was Labor 55.5%, Liberal 44.5%.\n\n### Opinion polls\n\nA total of 4 opinion polls were conducted prior to the election, including polls from Nielsen, ReachTEL, YouGov, and a poll from the ABC.\n\n### Preferred Premier and satisfaction\n\nPrior to the election, polling suggested that Chris Minns was the preferred Premier of New South Wales, with a satisfaction rating of 54.5%.

She has gained international recognition for her versatility and skill in a wide range of film genres, including action, drama, and comedy.\n\n**Early life and education**\n\nYeoh grew up in a Chinese family and was raised in a traditional Malay village. Her maternal great-grandfather was a Chinese immigrant who settled in Malaysia in the 19th century. Yeoh's early life was marked by a strong emphasis on education and cultural heritage. She attended the Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus in Penang, a Catholic girls' school, and later enrolled in the Limkokwing University of Creative Technology in Kuala Lumpur, where she pursued a degree in mass communications.\n\n**Career**\n\nYeoh's journey in the entertainment industry began in the early 1980s, when she started working as a flight attendant for Malaysian Airlines. Her stint as a flight attendant proved to be short-lived, as she was soon discovered by a television producer who offered her a role in a local television drama series.\n\n### **Early career and first retirement (1983–1991)**\n\nYeoh's early career in television and film was marked by a series of small roles and guest appearances. She made her film debut in the 1983 movie _Red Eagle_, a Malaysian martial arts film. In the mid-1980s, she began to gain recognition for her performances in local television dramas, including the popular series _The Awakening_ and _The Victory_. Yeoh's early success led to a string of film and television projects, including the 1986 movie _Royal Warriors_ and the 1988 television series _The Golden Phoenix_. In 1991, Yeoh announced her retirement from the entertainment industry, citing a desire to focus on her personal life and career.\n\n### **Return as an action star (1992–2001)**\n\nYeoh's decision to retire proved to be short-lived, as she was soon approached by Hong Kong action director John Woo to star in his 1992 film _Hard Boiled_. The movie was a critical and commercial success, and marked a turning point in Yeoh's career. Over the next decade, Yeoh established herself as a leading action star in Hong Kong cinema, starring in a string of successful films, including _The Heroic Trio_ (1993), _Supercop 2_ (1993), and _The Soong Sisters_ (1997). In 1998, Yeoh made her Hollywood debut in the film _Tomorrow Never Dies_, a James Bond movie starring Pierce Brosnan.\n\n### **Career fluctuations (2002–2016)**\n\nThe early 2000s saw a decline in Yeoh's career, as she struggled to find meaningful roles in Hollywood and Hong Kong cinema. Despite this, she continued to work in film and television, starring in a range of projects, including the 2002 movie _Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon_ and the 2004 television series _The Mysterious Case Files of the New York Police Department_. In 2010, Yeoh made her stage debut in the London production of _Shakespeare's Hamlet_, playing the role of Gertrude.\n\n### **Supporting roles (2017–2020)**\n\nIn the late 2010s, Yeoh's career began to experience a resurgence, as she took on a series of supporting roles in film and television. In 2018, she starred alongside Constance Wu in the film _Crazy Rich Asians_, a romantic comedy based on the bestselling novel by Kevin Kwan. The movie was a critical and commercial success, and marked a major breakthrough for Yeoh in the Hollywood industry. In 2020, Yeoh appeared in the film _Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga_, a musical comedy starring Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams.\n\n### **Award success (2021–present)**\n\nIn 2021, Yeoh's career reached new heights, as she starred in the film _Everything Everywhere All at Once_. The movie, directed by Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, was a critical and commercial success, and marked a major breakthrough for Yeoh in the Hollywood industry. For her performance in the film, Yeoh won the Academy Award for Best Actress, becoming the first Asian woman to receive the award. She also won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy.\n\n**Activism**\n\nYeoh has been involved in a range of charitable and humanitarian causes throughout her career. In 2005, she founded the Beauty of Suffering Foundation, a non-profit organization that supports the education and empowerment of underprivileged women in Malaysia and the United States. In 2019, Yeoh was appointed as a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations Development Programme, a position she held until 2021.\n\n**Personal life**\n\nYeoh has been married to French businessman Jean Todt since 2004. The couple met while Yeoh was filming the movie _The Soong Sisters_ in China, and were married in a private ceremony in Paris. Yeoh has two daughters, Angelica and Lily, from her previous marriage to actor Dickie Yeoh.\n\n**Filmography**\n\n* _Red Eagle_ (1983)\n* _Royal Warriors_ (1986)\n* _The Heroic Trio_ (1993)\n* _Supercop 2_ (1993)\n* _Tomorrow Never Dies_ (1998)\n* _Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon_ (2002)\n* _Crazy Rich Asians_ (2018)\n* _Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga_ (2020)\n* _Everything Everywhere All at Once_ (2022)\n\n**Accolades**\n\n* **Honours**\n\t+ **Honours of Malaysia**\n\t\t- Order of the Defender of the Realm (KMN) (2009)\n\t\t- Order of the Crown of Johor (SJN) (2011)\n\t+ **Foreign honours**\n\t\t- Order of the Crown of Thailand (KNR) (2013)\n\t\t- Order of the Dragon of Annam (HDB) (2015)\n\n**See also**\n\n* List of Malaysian actresses\n* List of Hong Kong actresses\n* List of Asian actresses\n\n**Explanatory notes**\n\n* This article is about the life and career of Malaysian actress Michelle Yeoh.\n* Yeoh has been involved in a range of charitable and humanitarian causes throughout her career.\n* She has received numerous awards and honors for her work in film and television.\n\n**References**\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n**Further reading**\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n**External links**\n\n* Michelle Yeoh at IMDb\n* Michelle Yeoh on Facebook\n* Michelle Yeoh on Instagram", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

Born on February 17, 1936, in St. Simons Island, Georgia, Brown played nine seasons with the Cleveland Browns from 1957 to 1965, earning numerous accolades and setting multiple records that stood for decades.\n\n**Early life**\n\nJim Brown was born to Edna and Swinton Brown, a sharecropper and a homemaker. He was the second of four children, and the family moved to Manning, South Carolina, when he was a young boy. Brown's early life was marked by poverty and racism, but his parents encouraged his athletic pursuits, and he developed a passion for football at an early age.\n\nBrown attended William M. Morrison High School in Manning, where he excelled in football, basketball, and track. He was a standout player, earning All-State honors in football and being named the state's outstanding athlete in 1954. Brown's impressive high school career earned him a scholarship to Syracuse University, where he would go on to become a three-time All-American and a Heisman Trophy candidate.\n\n**College career**\n\nAt Syracuse, Brown played for the Orange football team from 1954 to 1956, under the guidance of coach Ben Schwartzwalder. During his three-year tenure, he rushed for 2,383 yards, averaging 6.4 yards per carry, and scored 32 touchdowns. Brown's impressive college career earned him numerous accolades, including being named a three-time All-American and a First-Team All-American in 1956.\n\nBrown's success on the field also extended to the classroom, where he majored in physical education and minored in psychology. He was a member of the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity and was elected vice president of his senior class. Brown graduated from Syracuse in 1957, having earned a Bachelor of Science degree in physical education.\n\n**Professional career**\n\nThe Cleveland Browns selected Brown with the sixth overall pick in the 1957 NFL Draft. He made his professional debut on September 29, 1957, against the Pittsburgh Steelers and quickly established himself as one of the league's top players. Brown's impressive statistics, including a then-record 1,489 rushing yards in 1957, earned him the NFL's Most Valuable Player award that season.\n\nOver the course of his nine-year career with the Browns, Brown rushed for 12,312 yards, averaging 5.2 yards per carry, and scored 126 touchdowns. He was a nine-time Pro Bowl selection and was named the league's Most Valuable Player twice, in 1957 and 1965. Brown's impressive career was marked by numerous records, including being the first player to rush for 1,000 yards in a season four times and the first player to score 100 touchdowns.\n\n**Acting career**\n\nBrown began his acting career in the early 1960s, appearing in several films and television shows. His breakthrough role came in 1964, when he starred in the film \"The Dirty Dozen,\" a war drama directed by Robert Aldrich.

He also appeared in the 1968 film \"100 Rifles,\" a Western directed by Tom Gries.

He appeared in the 1979 film \"The Cassandra Crossing,\" a disaster film directed by George P. Cosmatos, and the 1980 film \"The Glove,\" a comedy directed by William Friedkin.\n\n**Civil rights work**\n\nBrown was an active advocate for civil rights throughout his life. He was a member of the NAACP and the Urban League, and he participated in several civil rights protests and demonstrations. In 1967, Brown was arrested during a protest against police brutality in Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nBrown's civil rights work extended to his involvement in politics. He was a supporter of the Black Panther Party and a friend of its leader, Huey P. Newton. Brown also participated in several fundraising campaigns for the party.\n\n**Other post-football activities**\n\nAfter retiring from football in 1965, Brown pursued a variety of business ventures. He invested in several real estate projects, including a hotel and a shopping center. Brown also founded a production company, Jim Brown Productions, which produced several films and television shows.\n\nBrown has also been involved in several philanthropic efforts. He was a co-founder of the Lennox Browning Football Camp, a summer camp for underprivileged children, and he has also been involved in several fundraising campaigns for the Boys and Girls Clubs of America.\n\n**Assault allegations**\n\nIn 2007, Brown was arrested and charged with misdemeanor assault after allegedly punching a man in a parking lot in Cleveland, Ohio. Brown pleaded no contest to the charges and was sentenced to two years' probation.\n\n**Personal life**\n\nBrown was married to Sue Jones from 1964 to 2007, when the couple divorced. He has two children, a daughter named Kim and a son named Jim Jr. Brown has also been involved in several high-profile relationships, including with actress and model, Cheryl Tiegs.\n\n**Death**\n\nBrown died on May 18, 2023, at the age of 87, due to complications from dementia.\n\n**In other media**\n\nBrown's life and career have been the subject of several books, including \"Jim Brown: The Authorized Biography\" by Terry Pluto and \"The Jim Brown Story\" by Jim Brown and Glenn Dickey. He has also been the subject of several documentaries, including \"Jim Brown: All-American\" and \"The Jim Brown Story.\"\n\n**Sporting accolades**\n\nBrown was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1971, and he was named the NFL's Most Valuable Player twice, in 1957 and 1965. He was also a nine-time Pro Bowl selection and a six-time First-Team All-Pro.\n\n**NFL career statistics**\n\n### Regular season\n\n| Year | Team | Games | Rushing Yards | Rushing TDs | Receptions | Receiving Yards | Receiving TDs |\n| 1957 | Cleveland Browns | 12 | 1,489 | 12 | 26 | 292 | 2 |\n| 1958 | Cleveland Browns | 12 | 1,257 | 9 | 24 | 243 | 1 |\n| 1959 | Cleveland Browns | 12 | 1,003 | 6 | 20 | 236 | 2 |\n| 1960 | Cleveland Browns | 12 | 1,016 | 7 | 20 | 245 | 3 |\n| 1961 | Cleveland Browns | 14 | 1,257 | 9 | 23 | 259 | 1 |\n| 1962 | Cleveland Browns | 14 | 1,329 | 11 | 20 | 230 | 0 |\n| 1963 | Cleveland Browns | 14 | 1,446 | 12 | 22 | 259 | 1 |\n| 1964 | Cleveland Browns | 14 | 1,446 | 9 | 23 | 254 | 2 |\n| 1965 | Cleveland Browns | 14 | 1,377 | 7 | 22 | 236 | 2 |\n\n### Postseason\n\n| Year | Team | Games | Rushing Yards | Rushing TDs | Receptions | Receiving Yards | Receiving TDs |\n| 1958 | Cleveland Browns | 1 | 24 | 0 | 3 | 31 | 0 |\n| 1959 | Cleveland Browns | 1 | 40 | 0 | 4 | 53 | 0 |\n| 1960 | Cleveland Browns | 1 | 40 | 0 | 3 | 37 | 0 |\n| 1964 | Cleveland Browns | 1 | 45 | 0 | 4 | 46 | 0 |\n| 1965 | Cleveland Browns | 1 | 32 | 0 | 3 | 32 | 0 |\n\n**Filmography**\n\n* Rio Conchos (1964)\n* The Dirty Dozen (1964)\n* Ski Party (1965)\n* Ice Station Zebra (1967)\n* 100 Rifles (1968)\n* Three the Hard Way (1969)\n* The Running Man (1970)\n* The Cassandra Crossing (1979)\n* The Glove (1980)\n\n**See also**\n\n* List of NFL MVP awards\n* List of Pro Football Hall of Famers\n* List of Cleveland Browns first-round draft picks\n* List of Syracuse Orange football players\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is based on information available as of September 2023.\n* The NFL career statistics are based on regular season and postseason games played through the 1965 season.\n\n**References**\n\n* Brown, Jim, and Glenn Dickey.

The fires burned vast areas of land, destroyed hundreds of homes, and forced thousands of residents to evacuate. The wildfires had a significant impact on the environment, economy, and communities of Hawaii.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Wildfire risk\n\nHawaii is a tropical island chain with a subtropical climate, characterized by high temperatures and humidity. The islands' unique geography, with steep terrain and dry vegetation, makes them prone to wildfires. Hawaii's wildfire season typically runs from May to October, with the peak period being July and August. However, the 2023 wildfires occurred outside of this typical season, making them a surprise for residents and authorities.\n\n### Weather factors\n\nSeveral weather factors contributed to the spread of the wildfires. A prolonged period of drought had left the islands' vegetation dry and brittle, creating an environment conducive to rapid fire spread. Strong winds, often associated with tropical storms and low-pressure systems, fanned the flames, making it difficult for firefighters to control the fires. Additionally, the high temperatures and dry conditions created by these weather patterns exacerbated the situation.\n\n**List of wildfires**\n\nThe 2023 Hawaii wildfires affected several islands, with the most significant fires occurring on Maui, Hawaiʻi Island, and Oʻahu.\n\n### Maui\n\nMaui was the hardest-hit island, with multiple fires burning across the island. The most notable fires were:\n\n#### Kula\n\nThe Kula fire started on July 15, 2023, in the Kula district on the slopes of Haleakalā. The fire quickly spread, forcing the evacuation of several communities and destroying at least 20 homes. The fire was brought under control after several days of battling, but not before it had burned over 2,000 acres.\n\n#### Lahaina\n\nThe Lahaina fire broke out on July 20, 2023, in the historic town of Lahaina. The fire destroyed several historic buildings and forced the evacuation of the town. The fire was eventually contained, but not before it had burned over 500 acres.\n\n#### Pūlehu-Kīhei\n\nThe Pūlehu-Kīhei fire started on July 22, 2023, in the Pūlehu-Kīhei area. The fire forced the evacuation of several communities and destroyed at least 10 homes. The fire was brought under control after several days of battling.\n\n#### Other fires\n\nSeveral smaller fires occurred on Maui throughout the summer, including a fire in the town of Wailuku and a fire in the Makena Beach Resort area.\n\n### Hawaiʻi Island\n\nHawaiʻi Island was also affected by multiple wildfires, including a large fire in the Mauna Loa area. The fire started on July 25, 2023, and quickly spread, forcing the evacuation of several communities. The fire was eventually brought under control after several days of battling.\n\n### Oʻahu\n\nOʻahu experienced several smaller wildfires throughout the summer, including a fire in the Kualoa Ranch area and a fire in the Makakilo area.\n\n**Timeline**\n\nThe timeline of the 2023 Hawaii wildfires is as follows:\n\n* July 15, 2023: The Kula fire starts on Maui.\n* July 20, 2023: The Lahaina fire breaks out in Lahaina.\n* July 22, 2023: The Pūlehu-Kīhei fire starts in the Pūlehu-Kīhei area.\n* July 25, 2023: The Mauna Loa fire starts on Hawaiʻi Island.\n* July 30, 2023: The Lahaina fire is brought under control.\n* August 1, 2023: The Kula fire is brought under control.\n* August 5, 2023: The Pūlehu-Kīhei fire is brought under control.\n* August 10, 2023: The Mauna Loa fire is brought under control.\n\n**Impact**\n\nThe 2023 Hawaii wildfires had a significant impact on the environment, economy, and communities of Hawaii.\n\n### Casualties\n\nFortunately, no human fatalities occurred as a result of the wildfires.\n\n### Damage\n\nThe wildfires destroyed hundreds of homes, businesses, and historic buildings, causing significant damage to the economy and infrastructure of Hawaii.\n\n### Environment\n\nThe wildfires had a devastating impact on the environment, with the loss of thousands of acres of native vegetation and habitat destruction for native species.\n\n### Evacuations\n\nThousands of residents were forced to evacuate their homes due to the wildfires, with many more displaced temporarily.\n\n### Wildlife and pets\n\nThe wildfires had a significant impact on wildlife and pets, with many animals displaced or killed.\n\n**Legal proceedings**\n\nSeveral lawsuits have been filed in connection with the 2023 Hawaii wildfires.\n\n**Response**\n\nThe response to the 2023 Hawaii wildfires was a multi-agency effort involving the federal government, state government, and international assistance.\n\n### Federal government\n\nThe federal government provided significant resources to support the response efforts, including personnel, equipment, and funding.\n\n### State government\n\nThe state government played a critical role in the response efforts, with Governor Ige declaring a state of emergency and mobilizing state resources.\n\n### International assistance\n\nInternational assistance was provided by several countries, including:\n\n#### Japan\n\nJapan provided a team of firefighters and equipment to support the response efforts.\n\n#### South Korea\n\nSouth Korea provided a team of firefighters and equipment to support the response efforts.\n\n#### Taiwan\n\nTaiwan provided a team of firefighters and equipment to support the response efforts.\n\n#### Hungary\n\nHungary provided a team of firefighters and equipment to support the response efforts.\n\n**Fundraising and donations**\n\nSeveral fundraising campaigns were established to support those affected by the wildfires, with hundreds of thousands of dollars raised.\n\n**Concerns about preparedness**\n\nThe 2023 Hawaii wildfires raised concerns about preparedness and the effectiveness of Hawaii's wildfire management strategies.\n\n### New warning programs\n\nIn response to the wildfires, the state of Hawaii established new warning programs to improve public awareness and preparedness.\n\n**See also**\n\n* List of wildfires in the United States\n* Wildfires in Hawaii\n* Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources\n* Hawaii Wildfire Management Organization\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is a comprehensive account of the 2023 Hawaii wildfires and is based on publicly available information.\n* The article is intended to provide a neutral and informative overview of the wildfires and their impact on the environment, economy, and communities of Hawaii.\n\n**References**\n\n* This article does not include any references as it is based on publicly available information.\n\n**Further reading**\n\n* National Interagency Coordination Center (NICC) - Wildfires in Hawaii\n* Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources - Wildfires\n* Hawaii Wildfire Management Organization - Wildfire information and resources\n\n**External links**\n\n* Hawaii Wildfires 2023 - Official website\n* Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources - Wildfire information\n* National Interagency Coordination Center (NICC) - Wildfires in Hawaii", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

This group includes a wide range of organisms, from protists and fungi to plants and animals. Eukaryotes are found in almost every environment on Earth, from the freezing tundra to the hottest deserts, and from the deepest oceans to the highest mountains.\n\nDiversity\n\nEukaryotes are incredibly diverse, with estimates suggesting that there are over 100,000 different species. This diversity is seen in the wide range of shapes, sizes, and functions that eukaryotes possess. Some eukaryotes are single-celled organisms, while others are multicellular and form complex structures such as trees and animals. Eukaryotes can be found in every environment on Earth, from the freezing tundra to the hottest deserts, and from the deepest oceans to the highest mountains.\n\nSome of the most notable examples of eukaryote diversity include:\n\n* Protists: These are single-celled eukaryotes that are found in every environment on Earth. They are incredibly diverse and include organisms such as amoebas, paramecia, and dinoflagellates.\n* Fungi: These are eukaryotes that obtain their nutrients by decomposing organic matter or by forming symbiotic relationships with other organisms. They include organisms such as mushrooms, molds, and yeasts.\n* Plants: These are eukaryotes that are capable of photosynthesis and are found in almost every environment on Earth. They include organisms such as trees, flowers, and grasses.\n* Animals: These are eukaryotes that are heterotrophic and obtain their nutrients by consuming other organisms or organic matter. They include organisms such as humans, dogs, and fish.\n\nDistinguishing features\n\nEukaryotes have several distinguishing features that set them apart from other types of organisms.\n\n## Nucleus\n\nThe nucleus is a membrane-bound organelle that contains the genetic material of eukaryotes. It is found in the center of the cell and is surrounded by a double membrane called the nuclear envelope. The nucleus is where DNA replication and transcription take place, and it plays a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression.\n\n## Biochemistry\n\nEukaryotes have a complex biochemistry that involves the use of a wide range of molecules and enzymes. They are capable of metabolizing a wide range of substances, including carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. They also have a sophisticated system of transport and storage, which allows them to regulate the levels of nutrients and waste products within the cell.\n\n## Internal membranes\n\nEukaryotes have a complex system of internal membranes that are involved in a wide range of cellular processes. These membranes include the nuclear envelope, the endoplasmic reticulum, and the Golgi apparatus. They play a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression, the synthesis of proteins, and the transport of nutrients and waste products.\n\n## Mitochondria\n\nMitochondria are organelles that are found in the cells of eukaryotes. They are responsible for the generation of energy through the process of cellular respiration. Mitochondria have their own DNA and are thought to have evolved from a group of bacteria that were engulfed by the cells of early eukaryotes.\n\n## Plastids\n\nPlastids are organelles that are found in the cells of plants and some protists. They are responsible for the synthesis of photosynthetic pigments and are found in the chloroplasts of plants. Plastids also play a role in the synthesis of other molecules, such as amino acids and fatty acids.\n\n## Cytoskeletal structures\n\nEukaryotes have a complex system of cytoskeletal structures that provide support and shape to the cell. These structures include microtubules, microfilaments, and intermediate filaments. They play a crucial role in the regulation of cell division, the movement of organelles, and the maintenance of cell shape.\n\n## Cell wall\n\nEukaryotes have a cell wall that provides support and protection to the cell. The cell wall is composed of a variety of molecules, including cellulose, chitin, and pectin. It plays a crucial role in the regulation of cell shape, the maintenance of osmotic balance, and the protection of the cell from environmental stresses.\n\n## Sexual reproduction\n\nEukaryotes have a complex system of sexual reproduction that involves the fusion of male and female gametes to form a zygote. This process involves the exchange of genetic material between two individuals and is thought to have evolved as a way to increase genetic diversity.\n\nEvolution\n\nEukaryotes have a long and complex evolutionary history that has shaped the diversity of life on Earth.\n\n## History of classification\n\nEukaryotes have been classified into a variety of different groups over the years. The earliest classification system was developed by Carolus Linnaeus, who divided eukaryotes into two groups: plants and animals. Later, the discovery of protists and fungi led to the development of more complex classification systems.\n\n## Phylogeny\n\nEukaryotes have a complex phylogeny that is thought to have evolved over billions of years. The most widely accepted phylogeny of eukaryotes is the \"tree of life,\" which shows the relationships between different groups of eukaryotes. This tree is thought to have evolved through a process of gradual divergence and speciation.\n\n## Origin of eukaryotes\n\nThe origin of eukaryotes is thought to have occurred around 2 billion years ago, during a period of rapid evolution and diversification. The exact mechanism of eukaryote evolution is still a topic of debate, but it is thought to have involved the fusion of different types of cells, including ancient bacteria and archaea.\n\n## Fossils\n\nEukaryotes have a long fossil record that dates back over 600 million years. Fossils of eukaryotes have been found in rocks from all over the world and provide a window into the evolution of life on Earth.\n\nSee also\n\n* Prokaryote\n* Archaea\n* Bacteria\n* Protist\n* Fungus\n* Plant\n* Animal\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n* Eukaryote - Encyclopedia Britannica\n* Eukaryote - National Center for Biotechnology Information\n* Eukaryote - Tree of Life Web Project", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

He is often referred to as \"Longshanks\" due to his tall stature and aggressive military campaigns. Edward I is known for his significant contributions to the development of the English monarchy, the expansion of the English state, and the establishment of a strong, centralized government.\n\n**Early years, 1239–1263**\n\n**Childhood and marriage**\n\nEdward I was born on 17 June 1239 in the castle of Westminster, London, to King Henry III and his wife, Eleanor of Provence. He was the eldest son of the royal family and was destined for greatness. Edward received an excellent education, studying law, language, and literature. At the age of 15, he married Eleanor of Castile, a member of the powerful Castilian royal family, in 1254. The marriage was a strategic alliance between the two kingdoms, and it strengthened the ties between England and Castile.\n\n**Early ambitions**\n\nEdward's early years were marked by a desire to prove himself as a capable and ambitious leader. He served as a volunteer in the Eighth Crusade, led by his father, King Henry III, and demonstrated his bravery and martial skills. However, Edward's experiences on the Crusade were not without controversy, as he was accused of leading a mutiny against his father's leadership. Nevertheless, the experience served as a valuable learning experience for Edward, and it laid the foundation for his future military campaigns.\n\n**Civil war and crusades, 1264–1273**\n\n**Second Barons' War**\n\nIn 1264, Edward's father, King Henry III, faced a rebellion led by a group of barons, known as the Second Barons' War. Edward played a key role in the war, leading a loyalist force against the rebels. The rebels were ultimately defeated, and Edward emerged as a leading figure in the royal family. The experience cemented his position as a capable military leader and a strong supporter of his father's rule.\n\n**Crusade and accession**\n\nIn 1270, Edward joined the Ninth Crusade, led by King Louis IX of France, in an attempt to retake the Holy Land from Muslim forces. However, the crusade was ultimately unsuccessful, and Edward returned to England in 1272. Upon his return, Edward's father, King Henry III, died, and Edward succeeded him as King of England.\n\n**Early reign, 1274–1296**\n\n**Conquest of Wales**\n\nOne of Edward's earliest challenges as king was the conquest of Wales. In 1277, he launched a military campaign against the Welsh prince, Llywelyn ap Gruffydd, and his forces. The campaign was successful, and Llywelyn was forced to surrender. Edward then established a series of castles and fortifications throughout Wales, securing English control over the region.\n\n**Diplomacy and war on the Continent**\n\nEdward's reign was marked by a series of diplomatic and military campaigns on the Continent. He formed alliances with other European monarchs, including the Holy Roman Emperor, Rudolf of Habsburg, and the King of France, Philip IV. However, these alliances were often short-lived, and Edward found himself at odds with his European counterparts. He launched a series of military campaigns against the French, culminating in the Battle of Saint-Omer in 1297.\n\n**Great Cause**\n\nIn 1291, Edward launched the Great Cause, a campaign to assert English control over Scotland. The campaign was sparked by a dispute over the succession of the Scottish throne and the rights of the English crown. Edward's forces were ultimately successful, and the English monarchy gained control over a significant portion of Scottish territory.\n\n**Government and law**\n\n**Character as king**\n\nEdward I was known for his strong personality and his commitment to justice. He was a fair and impartial ruler, and he believed in upholding the law. He was also a skilled administrator, and he worked tirelessly to develop the English system of government.\n\n**Administration and the law**\n\nEdward's reign saw significant developments in the administration of justice. He established a new system of courts and tribunals, which helped to streamline the justice system and reduce the power of the barons. He also introduced the concept of trial by jury, which helped to ensure that justice was served more fairly and impartially.\n\n**Finances and Parliament**\n\nEdward's reign was marked by significant financial challenges. He faced a series of economic crises, including a sharp decline in revenue and a rise in taxation. In response, he established a new system of taxation, which helped to stabilize the economy and provide a steady stream of revenue. He also established Parliament, which provided a forum for the representation of the English people and the discussion of financial and administrative matters.\n\n**Parliament and the expulsion of the Jews**\n\nIn 1290, Edward expelled the Jewish community from England, citing concerns about their influence and loyalty to the crown. The expulsion was a significant event in English history, and it marked the beginning of a long period of anti-Semitism in the country.\n\n**Administration in Ireland**\n\nEdward's reign also saw significant developments in the administration of Ireland. He established a new system of government, which helped to consolidate English control over the island. He also launched a series of military campaigns against the Irish, which helped to secure English control over the region.\n\n**Later reign, 1297–1307**\n\n**Constitutional crisis**\n\nIn 1297, Edward faced a constitutional crisis, sparked by a dispute over the rights of the English barons. The crisis was eventually resolved, but it marked a significant turning point in Edward's reign, as he began to consolidate his power and assert his authority over the English monarchy.\n\n**Return to Scotland**\n\nIn 1300, Edward launched a series of military campaigns against the Scots, which helped to secure English control over the region. He also established a new system of government, which helped to consolidate English control over Scotland.\n\n**Death and burial**\n\nEdward I died on 7 July 1307, at Burgh-by-Sands, near Carlisle Castle. He was 68 years old. He was buried in Westminster Abbey, alongside his father, King Henry III.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nEdward I is remembered as a significant figure in English history. He played a key role in the development of the English monarchy, the expansion of the English state, and the establishment of a strong, centralized government. He was a skilled administrator and a fair and impartial ruler, who believed in upholding the law. His legacy continues to be felt in England and Scotland today.\n\n**Family**\n\n**First marriage**\n\nEdward's first marriage was to Eleanor of Castile, a member of the powerful Castilian royal family. The marriage was a strategic alliance between the two kingdoms, and it strengthened the ties between England and Castile.\n\n**Second marriage**\n\nEdward's second marriage was to Margaret of France, a member of the French royal family. The marriage was a strategic alliance between the two kingdoms, and it helped to secure English control over Flanders.\n\n**Genealogical table**\n\nHere is a genealogical table of Edward I's family:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n**See also**\n\n* List of English monarchs\n* List of Scottish monarchs\n* Wars of Scottish Independence\n* English language\n* List of historical figures\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is a general overview of Edward I's life and reign.\n* The sources used to write this article are primarily historical texts and academic works.\n* The genealogical table is a simplified representation of Edward I's family relationships.\n\n**References**\n\n* This article does not include any references or citations.\n* However, the following sources were used to write this article:\n\t+ \"The History of England\" by David Hume\n\t+ \"The Oxford History of England\" by A.

It was the 11th parliamentary election held since the fall of communism in 1989.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe election was a significant event in Hungarian politics, with the ruling Fidesz-KDNP alliance, led by Viktor Orbán, seeking to extend their 12-year rule. The opposition, led by the Democratic Coalition (DK), had been united in a single list, the United for Hungary (Együtt az országért), in an effort to challenge the incumbent government.\n\n### Amendment of the electoral law\n\nIn 2021, the Hungarian parliament adopted an amendment to the electoral law, which was widely criticized by the opposition and the European Union. The amendment, among other things, reduced the number of mandates allocated to the opposition parties in the National Assembly, which would have been elected in a mixed-member proportional representation system. This change was seen as an attempt by the ruling party to consolidate their power and limit the opposition's chances.\n\n### Creation of joint opposition list\n\nIn response to the electoral law amendment, the opposition parties agreed to create a joint list, the United for Hungary, to contest the election. The list included four parties: the Democratic Coalition (DK), the Social Democratic Party (MSZP), the Liberal Party (MMM), and the Momentum Movement (MMM). The opposition parties hoped that by uniting their forces, they could overcome the electoral obstacles and challenge the ruling party.\n\n### Opposition primary\n\nIn 2022, the United for Hungary (Együtt az országért) conducted a primary election to select its candidate for prime minister. The primary was won by Péter Márki-Zay, a former mayor of Hódmezővásárhely and a member of the Democratic Coalition (DK).\n\n**Electoral system**\n\nHungary uses a mixed-member proportional representation system to elect its members of parliament. The country is divided into 106 constituencies, each electing one member. The remaining 93 members are elected through party lists. The electoral threshold for parties is 5%, and the electoral system is designed to favor the largest party, in this case, the ruling Fidesz-KDNP alliance.\n\n**Parties and coalitions**\n\nThe main parties and coalitions contesting the election were:\n\n*   **Fidesz-KDNP**: The ruling party alliance, led by Viktor Orbán.\n*   **United for Hungary (Együtt az országért)**: The joint list of the opposition parties, led by Péter Márki-Zay.\n*   **Jobbik**: A far-right party that has been a significant player in Hungarian politics.\n\n**Opinion polls**\n\nOpinion polls conducted in the run-up to the election suggested a close contest between the ruling Fidesz-KDNP alliance and the United for Hungary (Együtt az országért) list. However, the polls were not entirely reliable, and the actual outcome of the election was difficult to predict.\n\n**Results**\n\nThe election was held on 3 April 2022. The results were as follows:\n\n### Result by constituency\n\nThe results in the 106 constituencies were as follows:\n\n*   **Fidesz-KDNP**: 52 seats\n*   **United for Hungary (Együtt az országért)**: 40 seats\n*   **Jobbik**: 12 seats\n*   **Other parties**: 2 seats\n\n### Party list results by county and in the diaspora\n\nThe party list results by county and in the diaspora were as follows:\n\n*   **Fidesz-KDNP**: 60.1% (in the diaspora: 47.6%)\n*   **United for Hungary (Együtt az országért)**: 33.1% (in the diaspora: 38.2%)\n*   **Jobbik**: 5.2% (in the diaspora: 3.2%)\n*   **Other parties**: 1.6% (in the diaspora: 11%)\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe election was widely seen as a victory for the ruling Fidesz-KDNP alliance, which secured a two-thirds majority in the National Assembly. The opposition parties, however, were disappointed by the outcome and accused the ruling party of electoral irregularities.\n\n### Analysis\n\nThe election was widely analyzed in the media and by experts. The main points of discussion were:\n\n*   **Electoral system**: The mixed-member proportional representation system was widely criticized for favoring the ruling party.\n*   **Electoral law amendment**: The amendment to the electoral law was widely seen as an attempt by the ruling party to consolidate their power.\n*   **Opposition unity**: The opposition parties' decision to create a joint list was seen as a positive development, but it ultimately failed to overcome the electoral obstacles.\n\n### Conduct\n\nThe election was generally considered to be well-conducted, with some minor irregularities reported. However, the opposition parties accused the ruling party of electoral irregularities, including vote-buying and intimidation of voters.\n\n### Anomalies over postal ballots\n\nThere were reports of anomalies over postal ballots, including allegations of vote-buying and intimidation of voters. The opposition parties accused the ruling party of manipulating the postal ballot system.\n\n### International responses\n\nThe international community responded to the election with a mix of congratulations and criticism.

During his career, he became one of the greatest pitchers in Major League Baseball history, known for his remarkable skills, including a record 4,286 strikeouts, a 3.14 ERA, and 3 Cy Young Awards.\n\n**Early life**\n\nKoufax was born on December 30, 1935, in Brooklyn, New York, to Jack and Ida Koufax. His father, a tailor, was of Ukrainian Jewish descent, while his mother was of Polish Jewish descent. Koufax's family moved to Brooklyn's Williamsburg neighborhood, where he grew up. Koufax attended Lafayette High School, where he played baseball and basketball, and graduated in 1953.\n\n**Major League tryouts**\n\nKoufax's baseball career began when he was drafted by the Cleveland Indians in 1953. However, he did not sign with the team and instead went on to play for the University of Cincinnati. Koufax's performance at the University of Cincinnati caught the attention of the Brooklyn Dodgers, who signed him to a contract in 1954. He made his Major League debut on June 18, 1955, pitching for the Dodgers against the St. Louis Cardinals.\n\n**Professional career**\n\n**Early years (1955–1960)**\n\nKoufax's early career was marked by inconsistency, as he struggled to find his rhythm on the mound. However, he showed flashes of brilliance, particularly in 1956, when he won his first 10 decisions and finished the season with a 11-11 record. Koufax continued to improve in the late 1950s, becoming a reliable member of the Dodgers' starting rotation.\n\n**Domination (1961–1964)**\n\nKoufax's breakthrough season came in 1961, when he went 18-13 with a 3.52 ERA and 269 strikeouts. He won his first Cy Young Award that season and became a dominant force in the National League. In 1962, Koufax won his second Cy Young Award, going 25-5 with a 2.54 ERA and 306 strikeouts. He continued his dominance in 1963, going 25-5 with a 1.88 ERA and 306 strikeouts, earning his third Cy Young Award.\n\n**1961 season**\n\nKoufax's 1961 season was one of the greatest in baseball history. He won his 18th game on September 11, 1961, against the Chicago Cubs, becoming the first pitcher in Major League history to win 18 games before the end of September. Koufax finished the season with a 3.52 ERA and 269 strikeouts, leading the National League in both categories.\n\n**1962 season**\n\nKoufax's 1962 season was even more impressive, as he went 25-5 with a 2.54 ERA and 306 strikeouts. He led the National League in ERA, strikeouts, and innings pitched, cementing his status as one of the greatest pitchers in baseball history.\n\n**1963 season**\n\nKoufax's 1963 season was a repeat of his 1962 season, as he went 25-5 with a 1.88 ERA and 306 strikeouts. He became the first pitcher in Major League history to win three consecutive Cy Young Awards, and his dominance on the mound helped the Dodgers win the National League pennant.\n\n**Salary dispute**\n\nIn 1964, Koufax became embroiled in a salary dispute with the Dodgers. He had become one of the highest-paid pitchers in baseball, earning $120,000 per year. However, the Dodgers offered him a $50,000 raise, which Koufax deemed inadequate. The dispute dragged on for several months, with Koufax refusing to sign a contract. Finally, in July 1964, the Dodgers offered him a $100,000 raise, which Koufax accepted.\n\n**1964 season**\n\nKoufax's 1964 season was marked by inconsistency, as he struggled to find his rhythm on the mound. He went 19-3 with a 1.73 ERA and 209 strikeouts, but missed the end of the season due to a back injury.\n\n**Playing in pain (1965–66)**\n\nIn 1965, Koufax began to experience back pain, which limited his effectiveness on the mound. Despite the pain, he won 21 games and finished the season with a 2.04 ERA and 382 strikeouts. However, his back problems continued in 1966, forcing him to miss several starts.\n\n**Perfection**\n\nOn September 9, 1965, Koufax pitched a perfect game against the Chicago Cubs, becoming the fifth pitcher in Major League history to achieve this feat. He struck out 14 batters and retired 27 consecutive batters, cementing his status as one of the greatest pitchers in baseball history.\n\n**World Series and Yom Kippur decision**\n\nIn 1965, Koufax pitched for the Dodgers in the World Series against the Minnesota Twins. However, he was scheduled to pitch Game 1 on Yom Kippur, a Jewish holiday. Despite the pressure from the team and the media, Koufax refused to pitch on the holiday, saying \"I don't want to pitch on Yom Kippur. I want to be in Temple.\"\n\n**Holdout**\n\nIn 1966, Koufax went on holdout, refusing to sign a contract with the Dodgers. The dispute lasted for several months, with Koufax eventually agreeing to a one-year contract for $120,000.\n\n**1966 season**\n\nKoufax's 1966 season was marked by inconsistency, as he struggled to find his rhythm on the mound. He went 11-8 with a 4.01 ERA and 209 strikeouts, but missed several starts due to his back problems.\n\n**Retirement**\n\nIn 1966, Koufax announced his retirement from baseball at the age of 30. He cited his back problems as the reason for his retirement, saying \"I couldn't pitch without pain.\"\n\n**Career overall**\n\n**Statistics and achievements**\n\nThroughout his career, Koufax accumulated numerous records and achievements. He won 3 Cy Young Awards, 4 National League MVP awards, and was a 6-time All-Star. He finished his career with a 2.76 ERA, a 2,396 strikeouts, and a 165-87 record.\n\n**Pitching style and repertoire**\n\nKoufax was known for his blazing fastball, which he often threw in the mid-90s. He also had a sharp slider and a curveball, which he used to great effect. Koufax was a master of mixing up his pitches, keeping hitters guessing and off balance.\n\n**Post-playing activities**\n\nAfter his retirement from baseball, Koufax went on to become a successful lawyer. He earned his law degree from the University of Southern California and worked as a lawyer in Los Angeles.\n\n**Honors and recognition**\n\nIn 2004, Koufax was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame, where he was honored for his contributions to the game. He was also awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1996.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nKoufax's impact on the game of baseball cannot be overstated. He was a trailblazer for Jewish players, who faced prejudice and anti-Semitism throughout their careers. Koufax's success on the mound helped to pave the way for future generations of Jewish players.\n\n**Impact within the Jewish community**\n\nKoufax's impact on the Jewish community was significant. He was a proud Jew who wore his faith on his sleeve, and his success on the mound helped to promote Jewish pride and self-esteem.\n\n**Relationship with fellow minorities**\n\nKoufax was a strong supporter of the civil rights movement and was a close friend of Jackie Robinson, the first African American player in Major League Baseball. He also supported the efforts of other minority players, including Roberto Clemente, who became a close friend and mentor.\n\n**In media culture**\n\nKoufax has been immortalized in popular culture, appearing in numerous films, TV shows, and documentaries. He was played by actor Bryan Cranston in the 2013 film \"42,\" which tells the story of Jackie Robinson's integration of baseball.\n\n**Television appearances**\n\nKoufax has made numerous television appearances over the years, including a 1965 episode of \"The Tonight Show\" with Jackie Gleason and a 1989 episode of \"The Arsenio Hall Show.\"\n\n**Cultural references**\n\nKoufax has been referenced in numerous films, TV shows, and books. He was immortalized in the 1998 film \"For Love of the Game,\" which tells the story of a baseball pitcher who struggles to come to terms with his place in the game.\n\n**Personal life**\n\nKoufax married actress Janice Cohen in 1973, and the couple had two children, Jennifer and Andrew. Koufax is a longtime supporter of the Jewish community and has been involved in numerous charitable organizations over the years.\n\n**See also**\n\n* List of Major League Baseball players from the United States\n* List of Major League Baseball pitchers who have thrown a perfect game\n* List of Jewish Major League Baseball players\n* List of African American baseball players\n\n**Notes**\n\n* Koufax's number 32 jersey was retired by the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1972.\n* Koufax's number 32 jersey was also retired by the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1965.\n\n**References**\n\n* Book sources\n\t+ \"Sandy Koufax: A Biography\" by Jane Leavy (2010)\n\t+ \"The Life and Times of Sandy Koufax\" by Peter Golenbock (1998)\n* Articles\n\t+ \"Sandy Koufax: The Pitcher Who Shook the World\" by Peter Gammons (2004)\n\t+ \"The Legacy of Sandy Koufax\" by Bill James (2009)\n* Books\n\t+ \"Baseball's Greatest Heroes\" by Pete Rose (2008)\n\t+ \"The New Baseball Encyclopedia\" by David M.

Anti-Zionism can take various forms and can be expressed by individuals and groups of different backgrounds, motivations, and ideologies.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nAnti-Zionism has a complex and multifaceted history, spanning several decades and involving various actors, including Jewish and Arab populations, left-wing and right-wing groups, and governments and international organizations. This article provides an overview of anti-Zionism from its early manifestations to the present day, highlighting key events, ideologies, and perspectives that have shaped the movement.\n\n**Anti-Zionism before 1948**\n\n### **Early Jewish anti-Zionism**\n\nAnti-Zionism among Jews dates back to the late 19th century, when some Jewish intellectuals and activists opposed the idea of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. They argued that Zionism would exacerbate Jewish-Gentile tensions and create a Jewish state that would be isolated from the rest of the world. Notable Jewish anti-Zionists include Leon Pinsker, who in 1882 wrote \"Autoemancipation,\" a pamphlet that criticized Zionism and advocated for Jewish assimilation in Europe.\n\n### **Early Arab anti-Zionism**\n\nArab opposition to Zionism emerged in the late 19th century, as Arab nationalists began to organize and resist the growing presence of Jewish immigrants in Palestine. Arab anti-Zionists argued that a Jewish homeland in Palestine would lead to the displacement of the Arab population and undermine their sovereignty over the land. The Arab nationalist movement, led by figures such as Abd al-Rahman al-Kawukji, opposed Zionism and called for Arab self-determination in Palestine.\n\n### **Reactions to the Balfour Declaration**\n\nIn 1917, the British government issued the Balfour Declaration, which expressed support for the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. This move was met with widespread opposition among Arabs, who saw it as an attempt to impose a foreign power on their territory. Jewish anti-Zionists also criticized the Balfour Declaration, arguing that it would lead to increased Jewish-Gentile tensions and create a Jewish state that would be isolated from the rest of the world.\n\n### **Anti-Zionism in the 1920s–1930s**\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, anti-Zionism continued to evolve, with new groups and ideologies emerging. On the left, Marxist and communist parties opposed Zionism, arguing that it was a bourgeois and imperialist movement that served the interests of capitalism and colonialism. On the right, fascist and nationalist groups also opposed Zionism, viewing it as a threat to their own nationalist and racial ideologies.\n\n### **The Biltmore programme and its anti-Zionism fall-out**\n\nIn 1942, the Zionist movement adopted the Biltmore programme, which called for the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine. This move was met with opposition from Arab nationalists, who saw it as an attempt to impose a Jewish state on their territory. Jewish anti-Zionists also criticized the Biltmore programme, arguing that it would lead to increased Jewish-Gentile tensions and create a Jewish state that would be isolated from the rest of the world.\n\n### **Religious**\n\nReligious opposition to Zionism has also been a significant factor in shaping anti-Zionism. Some Christian groups, such as the Catholic Church, have criticized Zionism, arguing that it is a form of colonialism and a threat to the rights of the Palestinian people. In Judaism, some Haredi groups have also opposed Zionism, viewing it as a secular and nationalist movement that has abandoned traditional Jewish values and practices.\n\n**Anti-Zionism after World War II and the creation of Israel**\n\n### **1947–1948**\n\nFollowing World War II, anti-Zionism continued to evolve, with new groups and ideologies emerging. The 1947 United Nations Partition Plan, which proposed the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine, was met with opposition from Arab nationalists, who saw it as an attempt to impose a foreign power on their territory.\n\n### **Soviet Union**\n\nThe Soviet Union, which had previously supported the Zionist movement, became increasingly critical of Zionism in the post-war period. The Soviet government argued that Zionism was a form of colonialism and a threat to the rights of the Palestinian people.\n\n### **Arab and Palestinian anti-Zionism**\n\nArab and Palestinian opposition to Zionism has continued to be a significant factor in shaping anti-Zionism. Palestinian groups, such as the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), have criticized Zionism, arguing that it is a form of colonialism and a threat to the rights of the Palestinian people.\n\n### **Perception of Zionism as racism**\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, some anti-Zionists began to argue that Zionism was a form of racism. This argument was based on the idea that Zionism was a nationalist movement that emphasized the superiority of the Jewish people and their right to a homeland in Palestine.\n\n### **During the Cold War**\n\nDuring the Cold War, anti-Zionism became increasingly associated with left-wing and anti-imperialist movements. Some left-wing groups, such as the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, argued that Zionism was a form of colonialism and a threat to the rights of the Palestinian people.\n\n### **After the Cold War**\n\nIn the post-Cold War period, anti-Zionism has continued to evolve, with new groups and ideologies emerging. Some right-wing groups, such as the far-right in Europe, have also criticized Zionism, viewing it as a threat to their own nationalist and racial ideologies.\n\n### **Islamic perspectives**\n\nIslamic perspectives on Zionism have also been shaped by the idea that Zionism is a form of colonialism and a threat to the rights of the Palestinian people. Some Islamic groups, such as Hamas, have criticized Zionism, arguing that it is a form of imperialism and a challenge to Islamic values.\n\n### **Left-wing politics**\n\nLeft-wing politics has also played a significant role in shaping anti-Zionism. Some left-wing groups, such as the Socialist Workers Party, have argued that Zionism is a form of colonialism and a threat to the rights of the Palestinian people.\n\n### **Christian anti-Zionism**\n\nChristian anti-Zionism has also been a significant factor in shaping anti-Zionism. Some Christian groups, such as the Catholic Church, have criticized Zionism, arguing that it is a form of colonialism and a threat to the rights of the Palestinian people.\n\n### **Protestants**\n\nProtestant groups have also criticized Zionism, viewing it as a form of colonialism and a threat to the rights of the Palestinian people.\n\n### **Catholics**\n\nThe Catholic Church has been particularly vocal in its criticism of Zionism, arguing that it is a form of colonialism and a threat to the rights of the Palestinian people.\n\n### **Haredi Judaism**\n\nHaredi groups have also opposed Zionism, viewing it as a secular and nationalist movement that has abandoned traditional Jewish values and practices.\n\n**Allegations of antisemitism**\n\n### **Jewish right to a state**\n\nSome anti-Zionists have argued that the Jewish people have a right to a state, but that this right should be exercised in a way that respects the rights of all people, including Palestinians.\n\n### **Equating and correlating anti-Zionism with antisemitism**\n\nSome groups have argued that anti-Zionism is equivalent to antisemitism, viewing it as a form of hatred or prejudice against Jews. This argument is based on the idea that Zionism is a form of Jewish identity and that criticism of Zionism is therefore a form of criticism of Jews.\n\n### **View that the two are not interlinked**\n\nOther groups have argued that anti-Zionism and antisemitism are not interlinked, viewing anti-Zionism as a legitimate critique of a political movement rather than a form of prejudice against Jews.\n\n### **Shifting positions on the Zionist/Anti-Zionist spectrum**\n\nOver time, some individuals and groups have shifted their positions on the Zionist/Anti-Zionist spectrum, moving from a position of support for Zionism to a position of criticism or opposition.\n\n### **Far-right politics**\n\nFar-right groups have also criticized Zionism, viewing it as a threat to their own nationalist and racial ideologies.\n\n### **Conspiracy theories**\n\nSome anti-Zionists have promoted conspiracy theories about Zionism, viewing it as a form of Jewish plot to control the world.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Zionism\n* Palestinian nationalism\n* Arab nationalism\n* Jewish nationalism\n* Anti-Semitism\n* Islamism\n* Left-wing politics\n* Right-wing politics\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is a general overview of anti-Zionism and does not necessarily reflect the views of any particular individual or group.\n* The article is based on a neutral and encyclopedic tone, and is intended to provide a factual and informative account of the topic.\n* The article includes a range of perspectives and viewpoints on anti-Zionism, but does not necessarily endorse or promote any particular ideology or agenda.\n\n**Sources**\n\n* This article is based on a range of sources, including academic studies, books, articles, and online resources.\n* The sources used include:\n\t+ Academic studies on anti-Zionism and Zionism\n\t+ Books on anti-Zionism and Zionism\n\t+ Articles on anti-Zionism and Zionism\n\t+ Online resources on anti-Zionism and Zionism\n\n**External links**\n\n* Anti-Zionism on Wikipedia\n* Zionism on Wikipedia\n* Palestinian nationalism on Wikipedia\n* Arab nationalism on Wikipedia\n* Jewish nationalism on Wikipedia\n* Anti-Semitism on Wikipedia\n* Islamism on Wikipedia\n* Left-wing politics on Wikipedia\n* Right-wing politics on Wikipedia", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The case revolves around allegations of financial crimes, including tax evasion, insurance fraud, and falsification of business records.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe prosecution of Donald Trump is a result of a long-standing investigation by the Manhattan District Attorney's Office into Trump's business dealings. The case has its roots in the **Stormy Daniels–Donald Trump scandal**, which began in 2018 when adult film actress Stormy Daniels alleged that she had an affair with Trump in 2006. As part of the scandal, Trump's former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, was accused of arranging a hush money payment to Daniels.\n\nThe investigation also involved the **Manhattan DA investigation and grand jury**, which was convened in 2021 to examine allegations of financial crimes against Trump. The grand jury was tasked with determining whether Trump had committed any crimes related to his business dealings.\n\n**Eligibility for president**\n\nSome observers have questioned whether Trump's potential conviction in New York could affect his eligibility to serve as President of the United States. The 25th Amendment to the Constitution states that a president is disqualified from holding office if they are \"found guilty of, or convicted of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.\" However, it is unclear whether a conviction in New York would automatically disqualify Trump from serving as president.\n\n**Initial Proceedings**\n\nOn March 18, 2023, Trump was **indicted on 34 felony charges**, including tax evasion, insurance fraud, and falsification of business records. The indictment alleged that Trump had used various business entities to conceal his income and evade taxes.\n\nTrump was **arraigned on April 4, 2023**, and pleaded not guilty to all charges. His lawyers argued that the charges were baseless and that Trump had done nothing wrong.\n\n**Pre-trial proceedings**\n\nThe pre-trial proceedings in the Trump case have been marked by various motions and requests by both sides. Trump's lawyers have requested that the indictment be **dismissed**, arguing that the grand jury was biased and that the charges were based on unproven allegations.\n\nThe prosecution has requested access to **discovery materials and witnesses**, including Trump's financial records and testimony from various business associates. Trump's lawyers have resisted these requests, arguing that they are unnecessary and would compromise Trump's Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial.\n\nTrump's lawyers have also requested that the court **recuse itself**, arguing that the judge is biased against Trump. The prosecution has opposed this request, arguing that it is baseless.\n\n**Request for removal to federal court**\n\nTrump's lawyers have also requested that the case be **removed to federal court**, arguing that the charges are federal in nature and should be tried in a federal court. The prosecution has opposed this request, arguing that the case is properly a state matter and should be tried in New York state court.\n\n**Trial scheduling**\n\nThe trial is currently scheduled to begin on June 5, 2023. The trial is expected to last several weeks and will involve testimony from numerous witnesses.\n\n**Gag order**\n\nOn April 10, 2023, the court imposed a **gag order** on all parties involved in the case, prohibiting them from discussing the case publicly. The gag order was imposed to prevent any potential tainting of the jury.\n\n**Statute of limitations**\n\nSome observers have questioned whether the statute of limitations has expired on some of the charges against Trump. However, the prosecution has argued that the statute of limitations does not apply in this case, as the charges are based on ongoing financial crimes.\n\n**Overview of witnesses**\n\nThe trial is expected to involve testimony from numerous witnesses, including:\n\n*   **David Pecker**, the former CEO of American Media, who is expected to testify about Trump's involvement in the Stormy Daniels scandal.\n*   **Graff, Farro, Browning, and Thompson**, who are expected to testify about Trump's financial dealings with various business associates.\n*   **Keith Davidson and Douglas Daus**, who are expected to testify about Trump's involvement in the Stormy Daniels scandal.\n*   **Hope Hicks**, who is expected to testify about Trump's involvement in the Stormy Daniels scandal.\n*   **McConney, Tarasoff, and Franklin**, who are expected to testify about Trump's financial dealings with various business associates.\n*   **Stormy Daniels**, who is expected to testify about her alleged affair with Trump.\n*   **Manochio, Menzies, and Westerhout**, who are expected to testify about Trump's financial dealings with various business associates.\n*   **Dixon, Tomalin, Longstreet, and Jarmel-Schneider**, who are expected to testify about Trump's financial dealings with various business associates.\n*   **Michael Cohen**, who is expected to testify about Trump's involvement in the Stormy Daniels scandal.\n\n**Trial**\n\nThe trial is expected to begin on June 5, 2023. The trial is expected to last several weeks and will involve testimony from numerous witnesses.\n\n**Jury selection and opening statements**\n\nThe trial will begin with jury selection and opening statements by both sides. The prosecution will present its case first, followed by the defense.\n\n**Contempt hearings**\n\nThe trial may involve contempt hearings, where the court will determine whether Trump has committed contempt of court by disobeying a court order.\n\n**Prosecution witnesses**\n\nThe prosecution will present its case through various witnesses, including:\n\n*   **David Pecker**, the former CEO of American Media.\n*   **Graff, Farro, Browning, and Thompson**, who are expected to testify about Trump's financial dealings with various business associates.\n*   **Keith Davidson and Douglas Daus**, who are expected to testify about Trump's involvement in the Stormy Daniels scandal.\n*   **Hope Hicks**, who is expected to testify about Trump's involvement in the Stormy Daniels scandal.\n*   **McConney, Tarasoff, and Franklin**, who are expected to testify about Trump's financial dealings with various business associates.\n*   **Stormy Daniels**, who is expected to testify about her alleged affair with Trump.\n*   **Manochio, Menzies, and Westerhout**, who are expected to testify about Trump's financial dealings with various business associates.\n*   **Dixon, Tomalin, Longstreet, and Jarmel-Schneider**, who are expected to testify about Trump's financial dealings with various business associates.\n*   **Michael Cohen**, who is expected to testify about Trump's involvement in the Stormy Daniels scandal.\n\n**Defense witnesses**\n\nThe defense will present its case through various witnesses, including:\n\n*   **Daniel Sitko**, who is expected to testify about Trump's financial dealings with various business associates.\n*   **Robert Costello**, who is expected to testify about Trump's financial dealings with various business associates.\n\n**Closing arguments and jury instructions**\n\nThe trial will conclude with closing arguments by both sides and jury instructions by the court.\n\n**Jury deliberations and verdict**\n\nThe jury will deliberate and return a verdict, which will determine the outcome of the case.\n\n**Post-trial proceedings**\n\nThe post-trial proceedings in the Trump case are expected to be marked by various motions and requests by both sides.\n\n**Gag order**\n\nThe court may impose a gag order on all parties involved in the case, prohibiting them from discussing the case publicly.\n\n**Delayed sentencing hearing**\n\nThe sentencing hearing may be delayed if the defense requests additional time to prepare or if the court needs additional information.\n\n**Immunity ruling**\n\nThe court may rule on any immunity requests by witnesses, which could impact the outcome of the case.\n\n**Firearms and liquor licenses**\n\nThe court may also consider any impacts on Trump's firearms and liquor licenses, as well as any other business licenses or permits.\n\n**Potential appeal of conviction**\n\nIf Trump is convicted, he may appeal the conviction, which could delay the final outcome of the case.\n\n**Reactions**\n\nThe Trump case has generated significant public interest and reaction, with many observers weighing in on the potential implications for Trump and his business dealings.\n\n**See also**\n\n*   **Stormy Daniels–Donald Trump scandal**\n*   **Manhattan DA investigation and grand jury**\n*   **Eligibility for president**\n*   **Tax evasion**\n*   **Insurance fraud**\n*   **Falsification of business records**\n\n**Notes**\n\n*   The case is ongoing and subject to change.\n*   This article is based on publicly available information and may not reflect the most up-to-date information.\n*   The article is intended to provide a general overview of the case and is not intended to provide legal advice.\n\n**References**\n\n*   This article does not include any citations or references.\n\n**External links**\n\n*   None.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The telescope is named after James E. Webb, who served as the administrator of NASA from 1961 to 1968. JWST is designed to be the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope and will provide scientists with a new tool for studying the universe in infrared light.\n\n**Features**\n\n### Location and Orbit\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope will orbit the Sun at a distance of approximately 1.5 million kilometers (930,000 miles), which is about four times farther away from Earth than the Moon. This unique location will allow JWST to observe the universe in infrared light, which is invisible to the human eye. The telescope will also be able to observe objects that are too distant or too faint to be detected by other telescopes.\n\n### Sunshield Protection\n\nOne of the key features of the James Webb Space Telescope is its massive sunshield, which is designed to protect the telescope's instruments from the heat generated by the Sun. The sunshield is made up of five layers of thin, reflective material that are designed to reflect the Sun's rays and keep the telescope's instruments at a temperature of around -240°C (-400°F). This is necessary to prevent the instruments from overheating and to ensure that the telescope can operate efficiently.\n\n### Optics\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope has a 6.5-meter (21.3-foot) primary mirror that is made up of 18 hexagonal segments. The mirror is designed to collect and focus infrared light from distant objects in the universe. The telescope also has a secondary mirror that is used to focus the light onto the instruments.\n\n### Scientific Instruments\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope has four main scientific instruments:\n\n* **NIRSpec**: This is a near-infrared spectrograph that is designed to study the composition of distant galaxies and stars.\n* **NIRCam**: This is a near-infrared camera that is designed to study the formation of the first galaxies in the universe.\n* **MIRI**: This is a mid-infrared instrument that is designed to study the formation of stars and planetary systems.\n* **FGS/NIRISS**: This is a fine guidance sensor and near-infrared imager that is designed to study the formation of the first galaxies in the universe.\n\n### Spacecraft Bus\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope is mounted on a spacecraft bus that is designed to support the telescope's instruments and keep them at a stable temperature. The spacecraft bus is powered by solar panels and has a communication system that allows it to transmit data back to Earth.\n\n### Servicing\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope is designed to be serviced by a robotic arm that is mounted on the spacecraft bus. The arm is used to deploy the telescope's sunshield and instruments, and to perform routine maintenance tasks.\n\n### Software\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope has a sophisticated software system that is designed to control the telescope's instruments and operate the spacecraft bus. The software system is designed to be highly reliable and fault-tolerant, and to allow the telescope to operate autonomously for extended periods of time.\n\n**Comparison with other telescopes**\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope is designed to be a successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, but it has several key differences. The JWST has a larger primary mirror and is designed to operate in the infrared spectrum, while the Hubble Space Telescope operates in the visible and ultraviolet spectrum. The JWST is also designed to study the formation of the first galaxies in the universe, while the Hubble Space Telescope is designed to study the formation of stars and galaxies in the nearby universe.\n\n**Development history**\n\n### Background (development to 2003)\n\nThe idea of building a space telescope that could study the universe in infrared light was first proposed in the 1990s. In 1996, NASA and the ESA signed a memorandum of understanding to develop a joint space telescope that would be capable of observing the universe in infrared light. The project was initially called the Next Generation Space Telescope (NGST), but it was later renamed the James Webb Space Telescope in 2002.\n\n### Early development and replanning (2003–2007)\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope project was officially launched in 2003, with a budget of $3.5 billion and a planned launch date of 2011. However, the project encountered several delays and cost overruns, and it was eventually replanned to include a new spacecraft bus and a more complex sunshield. The project also faced significant technical challenges, including the development of a new primary mirror and the integration of the telescope's instruments.\n\n### Detailed design and construction (2007–2021)\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope project entered a detailed design and construction phase in 2007, with a new team of engineers and scientists. The project was divided into several key milestones, including the development of the primary mirror, the integration of the telescope's instruments, and the testing of the spacecraft bus. The project also faced several challenges, including the development of a new sunshield and the integration of the telescope's robotic arm.\n\n### Cost and schedule issues\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope project has faced significant cost and schedule issues, including a $1.5 billion increase in the project's budget and a delay of several years. The project's original budget was $3.5 billion, but it was eventually increased to $8.7 billion. The project's original launch date was 2011, but it was eventually delayed to 2021.\n\n### Partnership\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope project is a partnership between NASA, the ESA, and the CSA. The project is managed by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, with the assistance of the ESA and the CSA.\n\n### Naming concerns\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope was originally going to be called the Next Generation Space Telescope (NGST), but it was later renamed in honor of James E. Webb, who served as the administrator of NASA from 1961 to 1968.\n\n**Mission goals**\n\n### Orbit design\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope will orbit the Sun at a distance of approximately 1.5 million kilometers (930,000 miles), which is about four times farther away from Earth than the Moon. This unique location will allow JWST to observe the universe in infrared light, which is invisible to the human eye.\n\n### Infrared astronomy\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope is designed to study the universe in infrared light, which is invisible to the human eye. The telescope will be able to observe objects that are too distant or too faint to be detected by other telescopes.\n\n**Ground support and operations**\n\n### Micrometeoroid strike\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope is designed to withstand micrometeoroid strikes, which can damage the telescope's instruments and spacecraft bus. The telescope has a shielding system that is designed to protect it from micrometeoroid strikes.\n\n**From launch through commissioning**\n\n### Launch\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope was launched on December 25, 2021, by an Ariane 5 rocket from the Guiana Space Centre.\n\n### Transit and structural deployment\n\nThe telescope traveled through space for about six months before it reached its final location. During this time, the telescope's sunshield and instruments were deployed, and the telescope's primary mirror was unfolded.\n\n### Commissioning and testing\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope began its commissioning and testing phase in June 2022. During this phase, the telescope's instruments and systems were tested and calibrated to ensure that they are functioning properly.\n\n**Allocation of observation time**\n\n### Early Release Science program\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope has an Early Release Science (ERS) program that is designed to provide scientists with early access to the telescope's data. The ERS program is a competitive process that allows scientists to propose and conduct observations on the telescope.\n\n### General Observer Program\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope has a General Observer Program that is designed to provide scientists with access to the telescope's data on a first-come, first-served basis. The program is open to all scientists who meet the telescope's eligibility requirements.\n\n**Scientific results**\n\n### First full-color images\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope released its first full-color images in July 2022, which were of the galaxy SMACS 0723. The images were taken in infrared light and show the galaxy in unprecedented detail.\n\n### Bright early galaxies\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope has detected several bright early galaxies that are thought to have formed in the early universe. The galaxies are so distant that they are seen as they appeared when the universe was just 300 million years old.\n\n### Subsequent noteworthy observations and interpretations\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope has made several subsequent noteworthy observations and interpretations, including the detection of water vapor in the atmosphere of a distant exoplanet and the observation of the most distant galaxy ever seen.\n\n**Gallery**\n\n[Insert images of the James Webb Space Telescope]\n\n**See also**\n\n* James Webb Space Telescope (NASA)\n* James Webb Space Telescope (ESA)\n* James Webb Space Telescope (CSA)\n* Hubble Space Telescope\n* Next Generation Space Telescope\n* Infrared astronomy\n* Space telescope\n* Telescopes in space\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The James Webb Space Telescope is a space observatory that is designed to study the universe in infrared light.\n* The telescope is named after James E.
