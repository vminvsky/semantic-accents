The economics of open science explores the economic models, costs, benefits, and regulatory frameworks that underlie this paradigm shift. This article provides an overview of the key aspects of the economics of open science.\n\n**# Economic Models**\n\n## **Open Science Club**\n\nThe open science club is a concept that describes the collaborative and sharing aspects of open science. It involves researchers, institutions, and governments working together to create a global, open, and collaborative research ecosystem.\n\n### **Definitions of Knowledge Club**\n\nA knowledge club refers to a group of individuals or organizations that share knowledge, expertise, and resources to achieve common goals. In the context of open science, a knowledge club is a collective of researchers, institutions, and stakeholders that work together to advance knowledge and innovation.\n\n### **Knowledge Club and Open Science**\n\nThe knowledge club and open science are closely related concepts. Open science is a key driver of the knowledge club, as it enables researchers to share data, methods, and results, facilitating collaboration and accelerating innovation. The knowledge club, in turn, provides a framework for open science to thrive, by creating a culture of sharing, collaboration, and mutual benefit.\n\n## **Open Science Market**\n\nThe open science market is a hybrid market that combines elements of traditional publishing models with open access and collaborative approaches. It encompasses scientific publishing, data sharing, and collaborative research platforms.\n\n### **Scientific Publishing: a Hybrid Market**\n\nScientific publishing is a key component of the open science market. Traditionally, scientific publishing was a closed market, where journals and publishers controlled access to research articles. However, with the rise of open access and hybrid models, scientific publishing is becoming increasingly open and collaborative.\n\n### **From Readers to Authors: Hybrid and Full Open Access**\n\nHybrid models of open access allow authors to choose between traditional subscription-based publishing and open access models. Full open access models, on the other hand, require authors to pay a fee to make their research freely available to everyone. This shift is driven by the growing demand for open access and the need for researchers to showcase their work to a wider audience.\n\n### **From Publishing to Analytics: Diversification of Revenue Streams**\n\nThe open science market is diversifying its revenue streams, moving beyond traditional publishing models. Analytics and data services are becoming increasingly important, as researchers and institutions seek to extract value from their data and publications.\n\n## **Open Science Commons**\n\nThe open science commons is a digital knowledge commons that enables researchers to share and collaborate on research, data, and methods. It encompasses a range of platforms, including repositories, data sharing platforms, and collaborative research tools.\n\n### **The Emergence of Digital Knowledge Commons**\n\nThe digital knowledge commons has emerged as a key component of the open science ecosystem. It provides a platform for researchers to share and collaborate on research, data, and methods, accelerating innovation and reducing costs.\n\n### **Enclosures of Open Science Commons**\n\nThe open science commons is not without its challenges. Enclosures, or the restriction of access to knowledge and resources, can occur when institutions or individuals seek to control or profit from open science. This can undermine the collaborative and sharing aspects of open science, creating barriers to innovation and progress.\n\n### **Consolidation of the Common Ecosystem (2015-)**\n\nThe open science commons has undergone significant consolidation in recent years, with the emergence of new platforms and services. This has enabled researchers to share and collaborate on a wider range of research, data, and methods, accelerating innovation and reducing costs.\n\n**# Cost**\n\nThe cost of open science is a critical aspect of its economics. It encompasses the costs of editorial work and evaluation, technical infrastructure, and commercial services and prestige.\n\n## **Editorial Work and Evaluation**\n\nEditorial work and evaluation are critical components of open science. Researchers and institutions must invest time and resources in reviewing and evaluating research, data, and methods to ensure their quality and accuracy.\n\n## **Technical Infrastructure**\n\nTechnical infrastructure is essential for open science to thrive. Researchers and institutions must invest in platforms, tools, and services that enable data sharing, collaboration, and analytics.\n\n## **Commercial Services and Prestige**\n\nCommercial services and prestige are becoming increasingly important in the open science ecosystem. Researchers and institutions seek to showcase their work and expertise, while also generating revenue from their research and publications.\n\n**# Benefits**\n\nThe benefits of open science are numerous and far-reaching. They include reduced transaction costs, access costs, and increased research efficiency, as well as economic and social development.\n\n## **Transaction Costs**\n\nTransaction costs refer to the costs of accessing and using research, data, and methods. Open science reduces transaction costs by providing free and open access to knowledge and resources.\n\n## **Access Costs**\n\nAccess costs refer to the costs of accessing and using research, data, and methods. Open science reduces access costs by providing free and open access to knowledge and resources.\n\n## **Research Efficiency**\n\nResearch efficiency is a critical benefit of open science. By reducing transaction and access costs, open science enables researchers to focus on their research and innovation, rather than navigating complex and costly systems.\n\n## **Economic and Social Development**\n\nOpen science has significant economic and social benefits. It enables researchers to collaborate and share knowledge, accelerating innovation and reducing costs. It also provides access to knowledge and resources, promoting economic and social development.\n\n**# Economic Regulation of Open Science**\n\nThe economic regulation of open science is a critical aspect of its economics. It encompasses policies and frameworks that govern the sharing and use of research, data, and methods.\n\nNote: This article provides an overview of the key aspects of the economics of open science, without delving into specific details or examples. It is intended to provide a comprehensive and informative introduction to the topic.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The term \"anti-Zionism\" encompasses a range of perspectives and opinions, from opposition to the creation of a Jewish state to criticism of the policies and actions of the State of Israel.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe concept of anti-Zionism has existed since the early 20th century, when the Zionist movement emerged as a response to anti-Semitism and the persecution of Jews in Europe. However, the meaning and connotation of anti-Zionism have evolved over time, reflecting changing social, political, and historical contexts. This article provides an overview of the history and development of anti-Zionism, including its different forms, manifestations, and criticisms.\n\n**Anti-Zionism before 1948**\n\n### **Early Jewish anti-Zionism**\n\nSome Jewish groups and individuals were opposed to the idea of a Jewish state even before the establishment of the Zionist movement. For example, the Jewish Bund, a socialist organization based in Eastern Europe, rejected the idea of a separate Jewish state, advocating instead for equal rights and citizenship for Jews within existing states. Other Jewish groups, such as the Jewish Labor League, also opposed Zionism, arguing that it was a form of nationalism that would lead to the marginalization of Jewish communities.\n\n### **Early Arab anti-Zionism**\n\nArab opposition to Zionism was evident from the early 20th century, when Arab leaders and intellectuals began to express concerns about the potential consequences of a Jewish state in Palestine. The 1917 Balfour Declaration, which expressed British support for the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine, was met with widespread Arab opposition. Arab leaders, such as Sultan al-Atrash and Fakhri al-Khoury, argued that the declaration was a form of colonialism that would lead to the displacement and marginalization of Arab communities.\n\n### **Reactions to the Balfour Declaration**\n\nThe Balfour Declaration was met with widespread opposition from Arab leaders, intellectuals, and ordinary people. The declaration was seen as a betrayal of the Arab people, who had been promised autonomy and self-governance by the British government. The Arab Revolt of 1916-1918, which took place during World War I, was in part a response to the Balfour Declaration and the perceived threat it posed to Arab interests.\n\n### **Anti-Zionism in the 1920s–1930s**\n\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, anti-Zionism became a major issue in Palestinian politics. The Palestinian Arab Congress, which was established in 1919, was a key platform for anti-Zionist activism. The Congress advocated for the rights of Palestinian Arabs, including the right to self-governance and the protection of their land and property. The Palestinian Arab Revolt of 1936-1939, which was led by the Arab Higher Committee, was a major expression of anti-Zionist sentiment.\n\n### **The Biltmore programme and its anti-Zionism fall-out**\n\nThe Biltmore Programme, which was adopted by the Zionist Organization in 1942, called for the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine, with borders that would include large areas of Arab land. The programme was met with widespread opposition from Arab leaders and ordinary people, who saw it as a threat to their rights and interests. The programme contributed to the intensification of anti-Zionism in Palestine, which culminated in the 1947-1948 Arab-Israeli War.\n\n**Religious**\n\nReligious perspectives on Zionism and anti-Zionism vary widely, reflecting different interpretations of scripture and tradition. Some Jewish groups, such as the Haredi community, have traditionally been opposed to Zionism, arguing that it is a form of nationalism that is incompatible with Jewish values. Other Jewish groups, such as the Orthodox community, have supported Zionism, seeing it as a means of restoring Jewish sovereignty and self-determination.\n\n### **Protestants**\n\nProtestant churches and organizations have traditionally been divided on the issue of Zionism. Some Protestant groups, such as the Presbyterian Church (USA), have advocated for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, while others, such as the Southern Baptist Convention, have supported the State of Israel and its policies.\n\n### **Catholics**\n\nCatholic perspectives on Zionism and anti-Zionism are also complex and multifaceted. The Catholic Church has traditionally been critical of Zionism, seeing it as a form of nationalism that is incompatible with the values of the Church. However, some Catholic leaders, such as Pope John Paul II, have expressed support for the State of Israel and its right to exist.\n\n**Haredi Judaism**\n\nHaredi Judaism, which is a branch of Orthodox Judaism, has traditionally been opposed to Zionism. Haredi leaders and communities have argued that Zionism is a form of nationalism that is incompatible with Jewish values and that it will lead to the marginalization of Jewish communities.\n\n**Anti-Zionism after World War II and the creation of Israel**\n\n### **1947–1948**\n\nThe 1947-1948 Arab-Israeli War was a major turning point in the history of anti-Zionism. The war, which was fought between the newly established State of Israel and its Arab neighbors, resulted in the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians and the establishment of Israel as a Jewish state. The war marked the beginning of a new era of anti-Zionism, as many people around the world began to question the legitimacy and morality of the State of Israel.\n\n### **Soviet Union**\n\nThe Soviet Union was a major player in the anti-Zionist movement in the post-war period. The Soviet government, which was opposed to Zionism and the State of Israel, used its influence to promote anti-Zionist sentiment around the world. The Soviet Union also provided significant support to Arab states and Palestinian organizations, which were fighting against Israeli occupation and colonization.\n\n### **Arab and Palestinian anti-Zionism**\n\nArab and Palestinian anti-Zionism has been a major issue in the Middle East for decades. Palestinian leaders and organizations have long argued that the creation of Israel was a form of colonialism and that the State of Israel has no right to exist. The Palestinian National Council, which was established in 1964, has been a key platform for anti-Zionist activism.\n\n### **Perception of Zionism as racism**\n\nThe perception of Zionism as racism has been a major issue in the anti-Zionist movement. Many anti-Zionists have argued that Zionism is a form of racism that is incompatible with the values of equality and justice. The United Nations General Assembly's 1975 resolution, which equated Zionism with racism, was a major expression of this perspective.\n\n### **During the Cold War**\n\nDuring the Cold War, anti-Zionism was often linked to anti-Americanism and anti-Westernism. Many anti-Zionists saw the State of Israel as a pawn of Western imperialism and a tool of American foreign policy. The Soviet Union and its Eastern European allies were major players in this perspective.\n\n### **After the Cold War**\n\nAfter the Cold War, anti-Zionism continued to evolve and adapt to changing global circumstances. The rise of the internet and social media has made it easier for anti-Zionists to communicate and organize around the world. The growing awareness of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the humanitarian crisis in Gaza has also contributed to the intensification of anti-Zionist sentiment.\n\n### **Islamic perspectives**\n\nIslamic perspectives on Zionism and anti-Zionism are complex and multifaceted. Many Muslims see the creation of Israel as a form of colonialism and a threat to Islamic values and sovereignty. The 1988 fatwa issued by the Iranian Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, which called for the destruction of Israel, was a major expression of this perspective.\n\n### **Left-wing politics**\n\nLeft-wing politics has long been associated with anti-Zionism. Many left-wing groups and organizations have opposed the State of Israel and its policies, seeing them as a form of imperialism and a threat to social justice and equality.\n\n### **Christian anti-Zionism**\n\nChristian anti-Zionism has been a significant issue in the anti-Zionist movement. Many Christians have argued that the creation of Israel was a form of nationalism that is incompatible with Christian values and that the State of Israel has no right to exist.\n\n**Allegations of antisemitism**\n\nAnti-Zionism has often been linked to antisemitism, with some critics arguing that anti-Zionism is a form of antisemitism in disguise. However, many anti-Zionists argue that anti-Zionism is a legitimate form of criticism of the State of Israel and its policies, and that it is not inherently antisemitic.\n\n### **Jewish right to a state**\n\nThe idea that Jews have a right to a state is a central tenet of Zionism. Many anti-Zionists argue that this idea is a form of nationalism that is incompatible with the values of equality and justice.\n\n### **Equating and correlating anti-Zionism with antisemitism**\n\nThe idea that anti-Zionism is equivalent to antisemitism is a central tenet of the Zionist movement. Many Zionists argue that anti-Zionism is a form of antisemitism in disguise, and that it is therefore illegitimate and unjust.\n\n### **View that the two are not interlinked**\n\nMany anti-Zionists argue that anti-Zionism and antisemitism are not interlinked, and that anti-Zionism is a legitimate form of criticism of the State of Israel and its policies.\n\n### **Shifting positions on the Zionist/Anti-Zionist spectrum**\n\nThe Zionist/Anti-Zionist spectrum has evolved over time, reflecting changing social, political, and historical contexts. Many people who were once anti-Zionist have shifted their positions to become pro-Zionist, while others have shifted in the opposite direction.\n\n### **Far-right politics**\n\nFar-right politics has often been associated with anti-Zionism, with some far-right groups and organizations opposing the State of Israel and its policies.\n\n### **Conspiracy theories**\n\nConspiracy theories have often been linked to anti-Zionism, with some anti-Zionists arguing that the State of Israel is a tool of a global conspiracy to control the world.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Zionism\n* Israeli-Palestinian conflict\n* Anti-Semitism\n* Anti-Americanism\n* Anti-Westernism\n* Imperialism\n* Colonialism\n* Nationalism\n* Racism\n* Xenophobia\n* Islamophobia\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is intended to be a neutral and encyclopedic overview of the topic of anti-Zionism.\n* The article is not intended to be a comprehensive or definitive treatment of the topic.\n* The article is intended to provide a general understanding of the concept of anti-Zionism and its various forms and manifestations.\n* The article is not intended to be a critique or evaluation of anti-Zionism, but rather a neutral and informative presentation of the topic.\n\n**Citations**\n\n* This article does not include any citations or references.\n\n**Sources**\n\n* Books:\n\t+ \"The Zionist Idea\" by Arthur Hertzberg\n\t+ \"A History of Zionism\" by Walter Laqueur\n\t+ \"The Origins of the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict\" by Mark Tessler\n\t+ \"The Arab-Israeli Conflict\" by Ian Bickerton and Carla L.

The conflict began as a series of protests in the Donbas region of Ukraine, which eventually escalated into a full-blown conflict between Ukrainian government forces and the DPR and LPR.\n\nThe Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic are two autonomous republics that declared independence from Ukraine in 2014, following a series of violent clashes between Ukrainian government forces and pro-Russian separatists. While the Ukrainian government has not recognized the independence of the DPR and LPR, several countries and international organizations have expressed support for their recognition.\n\n**History**\n\nThe conflict in Donbas began in April 2014, following the ousting of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych in the wake of the Euromaidan protests. The protests were sparked by Yanukovych's decision to suspend preparations for a trade agreement with the European Union, and the resulting violence led to his eventual ousting.\n\nIn the aftermath of Yanukovych's ousting, a series of protests began in the Donbas region, which was largely inhabited by ethnic Russians and Russian-speaking Ukrainians. The protests were led by groups such as the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic, which declared independence from Ukraine in May 2014.\n\nThe Ukrainian government responded with military force, launching an operation to quell the separatist movement. However, the conflict escalated, and the Ukrainian military was unable to regain control of the region. Instead, the DPR and LPR were able to establish a degree of de facto control over their territories.\n\n**Aftermath of Russian Recognition**\n\nIn February 2022, Russia recognized the independence of the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic, marking a significant escalation of the conflict in Donbas. The recognition was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who stated that Russia would recognize the independence of the DPR and LPR as a matter of urgency.\n\nThe recognition was widely condemned by the international community, with many countries and international organizations expressing concern over the implications for regional stability and security. The recognition also led to a significant escalation of tensions between Russia and Ukraine, with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky stating that Ukraine would not recognize the independence of the DPR and LPR.\n\n**Countries and Entities that Recognized the DPR and LPR as Independent States**\n\n### UN Member States\n\nSeveral UN member states have recognized the independence of the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic. These include:\n\n* Russia: Recognized the independence of the DPR and LPR in February 2022.\n* Nicaragua: Recognized the independence of the DPR and LPR in February 2022.\n* Venezuela: Recognized the independence of the DPR and LPR in February 2022.\n\n### Non-UN States\n\nSeveral non-UN states have also recognized the independence of the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic. These include:\n\n* Abkhazia: Recognized the independence of the DPR and LPR in February 2022.\n* South Ossetia: Recognized the independence of the DPR and LPR in February 2022.\n* Nagorno-Karabakh: Recognized the independence of the DPR and LPR in February 2022.\n\n**Positions by Other Countries**\n\n### Countries and Entities that Supported Recognizing the DPR and LPR as Independent States\n\nSeveral countries and international organizations have expressed support for recognizing the independence of the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic. These include:\n\n* China: Has expressed support for the \"sovereignty and territorial integrity\" of the DPR and LPR.\n* Belarus: Has expressed support for the \"sovereignty and territorial integrity\" of the DPR and LPR.\n* Syria: Has expressed support for the independence of the DPR and LPR.\n\n### Countries and Entities that Did Not Support Recognizing the DPR and LPR as Independent States\n\nMany countries and international organizations have expressed opposition to recognizing the independence of the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic. These include:\n\n* United States: Has stated that the independence of the DPR and LPR is not recognized.\n* European Union: Has stated that the independence of the DPR and LPR is not recognized.\n* Ukraine: Has stated that the independence of the DPR and LPR is not recognized.\n\n### International and Regional Organizations\n\nSeveral international and regional organizations have expressed opposition to recognizing the independence of the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic. These include:\n\n* United Nations: Has stated that the independence of the DPR and LPR is not recognized.\n* Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE): Has stated that the independence of the DPR and LPR is not recognized.\n* Council of Europe: Has stated that the independence of the DPR and LPR is not recognized.\n\n**See also**\n\n* War in Donbas\n* Donetsk People's Republic\n* Luhansk People's Republic\n* Russian recognition of the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The international recognition of the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic is a complex and multifaceted issue that has been a topic of debate since the outbreak of the War in Donbas in 2014.\n* The conflict in Donbas began as a series of protests in the Donbas region of Ukraine, which eventually escalated into a full-blown conflict between Ukrainian government forces and the DPR and LPR.\n* The recognition of the independence of the DPR and LPR by Russia and other countries has been widely condemned by the international community.\n* The conflict in Donbas continues to be a significant challenge to regional stability and security, with ongoing fighting between Ukrainian government forces and the DPR and LPR.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

K. Rowling, is a British novelist, screenwriter, and philanthropist best known for writing the Harry Potter fantasy series. Born on July 31, 1965, in Yate, Gloucestershire, England, Rowling's life has been marked by both personal struggles and immense success.\n\n**Life and Career**\n\n### Early Life and Family\n\nJoanne Kathleen Rowling was born to Peter James Rowling and Anne Volant Rowling. Her father, a Rolls-Royce aircraft engineer, was a keen amateur wrestler, and her mother, a science technician, was a keen amateur actress. Rowling's family moved to Winterbourne, Bristol, when she was nine months old, and later to Tutshill, near Chepstow, Wales, when she was nine years old. The family struggled financially, and Rowling's parents divorced in 1990.\n\n### Secondary School and University\n\nRowling attended St. Michael's Primary School in Winterbourne and later Wyedean Comprehensive School in Gloucestershire. She was an average student and developed a passion for writing at an early age. After completing her secondary education, Rowling won a scholarship to study French and Classics at the University of Exeter. However, she dropped out of university in her first year due to financial difficulties.\n\n### Inspiration and Mother's Death\n\nRowling's mother, Anne Volant Rowling, passed away in 1990 after a long battle with multiple sclerosis. This event had a profound impact on Rowling, who has credited her mother's death with inspiring the character of Lily Potter in the Harry Potter series. Rowling also began writing the first Harry Potter book, _Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone_, during this difficult time.\n\n### Marriage, Divorce, and Single Parenthood\n\nIn 1992, Rowling married Portuguese television journalist Jorge Arantes, with whom she had a daughter, Jessica Isabel Rowling Arantes, in 1993. However, the couple divorced in 1995 due to Arantes's addiction to heroin. Rowling was left a single parent, struggling to make ends meet.\n\n### Publishing Harry Potter\n\nRowling's manuscript for _Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone_ was rejected by twelve publishers, but was finally accepted by Bloomsbury in 1996. The book was published in the United Kingdom in 1997 and became a moderate success. However, it was only after the book's success in the United States, in 1998, that it gained widespread recognition.\n\n### Films\n\nThe Harry Potter film franchise, produced by Warner Bros. Pictures, was adapted from the books by Rowling. The series consists of eight films, released between 2001 and 2011, and grossed over $7.7 billion worldwide. Rowling was heavily involved in the production of the films, serving as an executive producer and consultant.\n\n### Religion, Wealth, and Remarriage\n\nRowling is a practicing Christian and has been involved in various charitable initiatives, including the charity Lumos, which she founded in 2005. Her net worth is estimated to be over $1 billion, making her one of the richest authors in the world. In 2001, Rowling married Neil Murray, a Scottish doctor, with whom she has two daughters, Mackenzie Jean Rowling Murray and Davidson Nicholas Jock Rowling Murray.\n\n### Adult Fiction and Robert Galbraith\n\nIn 2013, Rowling published her first novel for adults, _The Casual Vacancy_, under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith. The book was a moderate success, and Rowling's identity as the author was not revealed until 2013. Under the pseudonym, Rowling has also published _The Cuckoo's Calling_ and _Lethal White_, both of which received critical acclaim.\n\n### Later Harry Potter Works\n\nRowling has published several companion books to the Harry Potter series, including _Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them_, _Quidditch Through the Ages_, and _The Tales of Beedle the Bard_. She has also written the screenplay for the film _Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them_ and has announced plans to write a sequel to the series.\n\n### Children's Stories\n\nIn addition to the Harry Potter series, Rowling has written several children's stories, including _The Ickabog_ and _The Christmas Pig_. The stories have been praised for their imaginative storytelling and exploration of themes such as friendship, love, and loss.\n\n**Influences**\n\nRowling's writing has been influenced by a range of authors, including Philip Pullman, Ursula K. Le Guin, and J.R.R. Tolkien. She has also cited her experiences as a single mother and her struggles with poverty and addiction as sources of inspiration.\n\n**Style and Themes**\n\n### Style and Allusions\n\nRowling's writing style is characterized by its use of vivid imagery, complex characters, and intricate plotting. Her stories often feature allusions to mythology, literature, and history, adding depth and richness to her narratives.\n\n### Themes\n\nRowling's stories often explore themes of good vs. evil, friendship, love, and redemption. Her writing also touches on issues such as social class, prejudice, and the struggle for power.\n\n**Reception**\n\n### Gender and Social Division\n\nRowling's writing has been praised for its portrayal of strong female characters and its exploration of themes related to gender and social division. However, some critics have argued that her stories reinforce patriarchal attitudes and stereotypes.\n\n### Religious Reactions\n\nRowling's depiction of magic and the supernatural has been the subject of controversy among some Christian groups, who have criticized her work as promoting paganism and occultism.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nRowling's impact on popular culture is undeniable.

From the early days of the Russian Empire to the present day, Russian cinema has undergone significant changes, reflecting the country's cultural, social, and political developments.\n\n**Cinema of the Russian Empire**\n\nThe first Russian film, \"The Horse in an Excessive Hurry,\" was released in 1908. However, it was not until the 1910s that Russian cinema began to gain momentum. The country's film industry was largely based in Moscow and Saint Petersburg, with the Biograf and Pathe companies being two of the earliest film studios. During this period, Russian filmmakers began to experiment with various styles and genres, including drama, comedy, and fantasy.\n\nOne of the most notable figures of early Russian cinema was Yakov Protasanov, who directed the 1915 film \"The Death Ray.\" This science fiction film was a groundbreaking achievement in special effects and storytelling. Another influential filmmaker of the time was Lev Kuleshov, who is credited with creating the concept of montage editing. Kuleshov's work had a significant impact on the development of Soviet cinema.\n\n**Cinema of the Soviet Union**\n\nThe Russian Revolution of 1917 marked a significant turning point in the country's film industry. The new Soviet government saw cinema as a powerful tool for propaganda and education. In 1918, the Soviet government established the State Committee for Cinematography, which played a crucial role in shaping the country's film policy.\n\n**Early Soviet cinema (1917–1953)**\n\nDuring the 1920s, Soviet cinema underwent significant changes, with the introduction of new techniques and styles. Filmmakers such as Sergei Eisenstein, Vsevolod Pudovkin, and Dziga Vertov became prominent figures in the industry. Their work was characterized by its experimental nature, with a focus on montage editing and the use of non-naturalistic settings.\n\nEisenstein's 1925 film \"Battleship Potemkin\" is a classic example of early Soviet cinema. The film's use of montage editing and its depiction of the 1905 Russian Revolution made it a powerful and influential work. Pudovkin's 1926 film \"The Mother\" also showcased the new techniques and styles of Soviet cinema.\n\n**Late Soviet cinema (1953–1990)**\n\nThe death of Joseph Stalin in 1953 marked a significant turning point in Soviet cinema. The new government allowed for greater creative freedom, and filmmakers began to experiment with new styles and genres.\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, Soviet cinema experienced a period of significant growth and development. Filmmakers such as Andrei Tarkovsky, Andrei Konchalovsky, and Nikita Mikhalkov became prominent figures in the industry. Their work was characterized by its focus on themes such as spirituality, morality, and the human condition.\n\nTarkovsky's 1975 film \"Andrei Rublev\" is a classic example of late Soviet cinema. The film's use of slow pacing and its focus on the life of the medieval Russian icon painter Andrei Rublev made it a powerful and influential work.\n\n**New Russian cinema**\n\nThe collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 marked a significant turning point in Russian cinema. The new government allowed for greater creative freedom, and filmmakers began to experiment with new styles and genres.\n\n**1990s**\n\nDuring the 1990s, Russian cinema experienced a period of significant growth and development. Filmmakers such as Alexander Sokurov, Alexander Sokurov's \"Russian Ark\" (2002), and Nikita Mikhalkov's \"Burnt by the Sun\" (1994) became prominent figures in the industry.\n\n**2000s**\n\nDuring the 2000s, Russian cinema continued to grow and develop. Filmmakers such as Fyodor Bondarchuk, whose \"Stalingrad\" (2013) was a commercial success, and Andrey Zvyagintsev, whose \"Leviathan\" (2014) was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, became prominent figures in the industry.\n\n**2010s**\n\nDuring the 2010s, Russian cinema continued to grow and develop. Filmmakers such as Kirill Serebrennikov, whose \"The Student\" (2016) was a commercial success, and Andrey Zvyagintsev, whose \"Loveless\" (2017) was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, became prominent figures in the industry.\n\n**2020s**\n\nDuring the 2020s, Russian cinema continued to grow and develop. Filmmakers such as Kirill Serebrennikov, whose \"Leto\" (2018) was a critical success, and Andrey Zvyagintsev, whose \"The Man Who Surprised His Wife\" (2020) was a commercial success, became prominent figures in the industry.\n\n**2022 boycott**\n\nIn 2022, following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, many filmmakers and film festivals around the world announced a boycott of Russian cinema. The boycott was in response to the Russian government's actions and its treatment of Ukrainian civilians.\n\n**Russian film production**\n\nRussian film production has grown significantly in recent years. According to a report by the Russian Federal Agency for Press and Mass Communications, the country's film industry produced over 200 films in 2020, with a total budget of over $1 billion.\n\n**Leading production companies on the market**\n\nSome of the leading production companies in the Russian film industry include:\n\n* Central Partnership\n* Soyuzmultfilm\n* CTB Film Company\n* Melorosso Company\n* Vremya Sredy\n\n**List of highest-grossing films**\n\nSome of the highest-grossing films in the Russian film industry include:\n\n* \"Burnt by the Sun\" (1994)\n* \"The Return\" (2003)\n* \"The Student\" (2016)\n* \"Leviathan\" (2014)\n* \"Loveless\" (2017)\n\n**Film distribution**\n\nFilm distribution in Russia is a growing industry. Many international film distributors have entered the market, including companies such as Warner Bros. and Universal Pictures.\n\n**Awards**\n\nRussian filmmakers have received numerous awards for their work.

Launched on December 25, 2021, by the Ariane 5 rocket from the Guiana Space Centre in French Guiana, JWST is the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope and is one of the most complex space telescopes ever built.\n\n**Features**\n\n### **Location and Orbit**\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope will orbit the Earth at a distance of approximately 1.5 million kilometers (930,000 miles), which is about four times farther away from the Earth than the Moon. This orbit is designed to allow the telescope to maintain a stable temperature, as the Sun's radiation would severely impact its instruments. The telescope's orbit is also optimized to allow for a continuous view of the universe without interference from the Earth or its atmosphere.\n\n### **Sunshield Protection**\n\nOne of the unique features of the James Webb Space Telescope is its sunshield, a five-layered system designed to protect the telescope's instruments from the Sun's heat. The sunshield is made of a lightweight material called Kapton and is covered with a thin layer of aluminum to reflect the Sun's radiation. The sunshield is deployed after launch and is critical to maintaining the telescope's temperature, which must be kept below 50 Kelvin (-223°C or -370°F) to allow for precise astronomical observations.\n\n### **Optics**\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope has a 6.5-meter (21.3-foot) primary mirror, which is made up of 18 hexagonal segments that can be adjusted to form a precise optical surface. The mirror is coated with a thin layer of gold to increase its reflectivity in the infrared spectrum. The telescope's optics are designed to collect and focus infrared light from distant objects, allowing for high-resolution images and spectra to be obtained.\n\n### **Scientific Instruments**\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope has four main scientific instruments:\n\n1. **NIRCam** (Near-Infrared Camera): A high-resolution camera that can detect faint objects in the near-infrared spectrum.\n2. **NIRSpec** (Near-Infrared Spectrograph): A spectrograph that can analyze the light from distant objects, providing information about their composition and motion.\n3. **MIRI** (Mid-Infrared Instrument): A mid-infrared camera and spectrograph that can detect the light from cool objects, such as stars and planets.\n4. **FGS/NIRISS** (Fine Guidance Sensor/Near-Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph): A dual-purpose instrument that can provide precise guidance for the telescope while also taking high-resolution images and spectra.\n\n### **Spacecraft Bus**\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope's spacecraft bus is responsible for providing power, communication, and navigation for the telescope. The bus is powered by solar panels and is equipped with a high-gain antenna for communication with Earth. The bus also contains the telescope's computer and software, which control the instrument's operations and data collection.\n\n### **Servicing**\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope is designed to be serviced by the European Space Agency's (ESA) Airbus-built Ariane 5 rocket, which will provide a platform for performing routine maintenance and repairs. The telescope's solar panels and sunshield can also be adjusted and replaced as needed.\n\n### **Software**\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope's software is responsible for controlling the instrument's operations, data collection, and transmission to Earth. The software includes a set of commands and procedures that allow for the telescope's instruments to be configured and operated in a variety of modes. The software also includes a set of tools for analyzing and processing the data collected by the telescope.\n\n**Comparison with other telescopes**\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope is designed to be a successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, which has been operating since 1990. While Hubble has made numerous groundbreaking discoveries, its ability to observe the universe in infrared light is limited due to its design. The James Webb Space Telescope is designed to overcome this limitation, allowing for the study of the universe in unprecedented detail.\n\n**Development history**\n\n### **Background (development to 2003)**\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope was first proposed in 1996 as a successor to the Hubble Space Telescope. The project was initially called the Next Generation Space Telescope (NGST) and was designed to be a 6.5-meter (21.3-foot) space telescope with a 7-meter (23-foot) primary mirror. The project was canceled in 1999 due to budget constraints, but was later revived in 2003 as the James Webb Space Telescope.\n\n### **Early development and replanning (2003–2007)**\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope project was restarted in 2003 with a new set of requirements and a revised design. The project was led by NASA with participation from the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). The telescope's design was significantly changed from the original NGST design, with a new set of instruments and a revised primary mirror.\n\n### **Detailed design and construction (2007–2021)**\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope's detailed design and construction began in 2007, with the selection of the primary mirror segments and the development of the instrument's software. The telescope's components were built by a variety of contractors, including Ball Aerospace, Northrop Grumman, and Teledyne Brown Engineering. The telescope was assembled and integrated at Northrop Grumman's facilities in Redondo Beach, California.\n\n### **Cost and schedule issues**\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope project has faced significant cost and schedule issues over the years. The project's budget was initially estimated at $3.5 billion, but grew to over $8.7 billion due to a variety of factors, including changes to the telescope's design and the need for additional testing and integration. The project's schedule was also delayed due to a variety of factors, including the need for additional testing and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n### **Partnership**\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope is a partnership between NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). The project is led by NASA, with the ESA providing a significant portion of the telescope's budget and the CSA providing a smaller portion.\n\n### **Naming concerns**\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope was originally named the Next Generation Space Telescope (NGST), but was later renamed in honor of James E. Webb, a former NASA administrator. Some astronomers and scientists have expressed concerns about the naming of the telescope, arguing that it should be named after a scientist or astronomer who made significant contributions to the field.\n\n**Mission goals**\n\n### **Orbit design**\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope will orbit the Earth at a distance of approximately 1.5 million kilometers (930,000 miles), which is about four times farther away from the Earth than the Moon. This orbit is designed to allow the telescope to maintain a stable temperature, as the Sun's radiation would severely impact its instruments.\n\n### **Infrared astronomy**\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope is designed to study the universe in infrared light, which is particularly useful for observing cool objects such as stars, planets, and galaxies. The telescope's instruments are designed to detect the light from these objects and provide information about their composition and motion.\n\n**Ground support and operations**\n\n### **Micrometeoroid strike**\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope is designed to withstand micrometeoroid strikes, which are small particles that can damage the telescope's instruments. The telescope's sunshield and other components are designed to provide protection from micrometeoroid strikes.\n\n**From launch through commissioning**\n\n### **Launch**\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope was launched on December 25, 2021, by the Ariane 5 rocket from the Guiana Space Centre in French Guiana.\n\n### **Transit and structural deployment**\n\nThe telescope's transit and structural deployment occurred after launch, with the telescope's solar panels and sunshield being deployed and adjusted to their final positions.\n\n### **Commissioning and testing**\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope underwent commissioning and testing after its launch, with the telescope's instruments being powered up and tested to ensure that they were functioning properly.\n\n**Allocation of observation time**\n\n### **Early Release Science program**\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope's Early Release Science program will provide a set of observations and data that will be made available to the public and the scientific community.\n\n### **General Observer Program**\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope's General Observer Program will provide a set of observations and data that will be made available to the public and the scientific community.\n\n**Scientific results**\n\n### **First full-color images**\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope has released its first full-color images, which show the galaxy SMACS 0723 and the Carina Nebula.\n\n### **Bright early galaxies**\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope has observed a number of bright early galaxies, including GN-z11 and EGS-zs8-1.\n\n### **Subsequent noteworthy observations and interpretations**\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope has made a number of subsequent noteworthy observations and interpretations, including the detection of water vapor in the atmosphere of a distant exoplanet and the observation of the most distant galaxy ever seen.\n\n**Gallery**\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope has released a number of images and videos that show its instruments and components in detail.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Hubble Space Telescope\n* Next Generation Space Telescope\n* European Space Agency\n* Canadian Space Agency\n* Ariane 5 rocket\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The James Webb Space Telescope is a collaborative project between NASA, the European Space Agency, and the Canadian Space Agency.\n* The telescope's instruments are designed to study the universe in infrared light.\n* The telescope's orbit is designed to allow for a continuous view of the universe without interference from the Earth or its atmosphere.\n\n**References**\n\n* NASA.

This genre has been a fascinating aspect of musical composition, with many renowned composers contributing to its rich history.\n\n**Notable Sets that Cover All 24 Keys**\n\nOne of the most notable sets of music written in all major or minor keys is the \"48 Preludes and Fugues\" by Johann Sebastian Bach, also known as \"The Well-Tempered Clavier\". This masterpiece, composed between 1722 and 1742, consists of 48 preludes and fugues, each in a different key. Bach's work is considered a pinnacle of Baroque music and a testament to his innovative and technical skills.\n\nAnother notable set is the \"48 Preludes\" by Sergei Rachmaninoff, composed in 1916. While not as well-known as Bach's \"The Well-Tempered Clavier\", Rachmaninoff's set is still a remarkable achievement, showcasing his mastery of tonal possibilities.\n\n**Composers Who Wrote Multiple Sets**\n\nSeveral composers have written multiple sets of music in all 24 keys. One notable example is the American composer, Dane Rudhyar, who wrote three sets of 24 pieces each, exploring different musical styles and genres.\n\nAnother composer who wrote multiple sets is the Russian composer, Alexander Scriabin. His \"24 Preludes\" (1908) and \"24 Preludes\" (1914) are two notable examples of his work in this genre.\n\n**Variants**\n\nWhile music written in all major or minor keys typically consists of 24 pieces, there are several variants that explore different aspects of tonal possibilities.\n\n**Single Pieces that Modulate through Many Keys**\n\nSome composers have written single pieces that modulate through many keys, often creating a sense of drama and tension. One notable example is the \"Variations on a Theme by Haydn\" by Robert Schumann, which modulates through 17 different keys.\n\nAnother example is the \"Piano Sonata No. 8\" by Ludwig van Beethoven, which modulates through 10 different keys.\n\n**Works Covering All Eight Church Modes**\n\nIn addition to music written in all 24 keys, some composers have explored the eight church modes, which were used in ancient Greek music. One notable example is the \"Missa Papae Marcelli\" by Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, which uses all eight church modes.\n\nAnother example is the \"Mass for the Dead\" by William Byrd, which also uses all eight church modes.\n\n**Other Sets of 24 Pieces**\n\nIn addition to the sets mentioned earlier, there are several other sets of 24 pieces that explore different musical styles and genres. One notable example is the \"24 Caprices\" for solo violin by Niccolò Paganini, which showcase his technical mastery of the instrument.\n\nAnother example is the \"24 Etudes\" for solo piano by Frédéric Chopin, which explore different aspects of piano technique and musical expression.\n\n**Keys**\n\nWhen composing music in all 24 keys, composers often use a specific order of keys. One common order is the ascending order of major keys, from C major to B major.\n\nAnother order is the ascending order of minor keys, from A minor to B minor.\n\n**History**\n\nMusic written in all major or minor keys has a rich history, spanning several centuries.\n\n**Bach and his Precursors**\n\nJohann Sebastian Bach was a pioneer in music written in all 24 keys. His \"The Well-Tempered Clavier\" is considered a masterpiece of Baroque music and a testament to his innovative and technical skills.\n\nOne of Bach's precursors was the Dutch composer, Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck, who wrote a set of 24 pieces in all major and minor keys.\n\n**After Bach**\n\nAfter Bach, several composers continued to explore music written in all major or minor keys.\n\n**18th and 19th Centuries**\n\nDuring the 18th and 19th centuries, several composers wrote sets of music in all 24 keys. One notable example is the \"48 Preludes\" by Sergei Rachmaninoff, composed in 1916.\n\nAnother example is the \"24 Preludes\" by Alexander Scriabin, composed in 1908.\n\n**20th Century**\n\nDuring the 20th century, several composers continued to explore music written in all major or minor keys.\n\n**1901-1950**\n\nOne notable example is the \"24 Preludes\" by Dane Rudhyar, composed in 1946.\n\nAnother example is the \"24 Etudes\" for solo piano by Witold Lutosławski, composed in 1949.\n\n**1951-2000**\n\nOne notable example is the \"24 Preludes\" by György Ligeti, composed in 1956.\n\nAnother example is the \"24 Preludes\" by Iannis Xenakis, composed in 1975.\n\n**21st Century**\n\nDuring the 21st century, several composers have continued to explore music written in all major or minor keys.\n\n**Notes**\n\nMusic written in all major or minor keys is a fascinating aspect of musical composition, with many renowned composers contributing to its rich history. This genre continues to evolve, with contemporary composers exploring new and innovative ways to express tonal possibilities.\n\n**References**\n\nThis article is a comprehensive overview of music written in all major or minor keys.

He is a three-time Olympic medalist and a two-time World Champion. An's career has been marked by controversy, particularly in his conflicts with the Korea Skating Union and his decision to naturalize as a Russian citizen.\n\n**Early life and education**\n\nViktor_An was born on March 30, 1984, in Seoul, South Korea. His full name is Viktor Kim. An's early life and education are not well-documented in the public domain.\n\n**Career**\n\n### 2000s\n\n#### Early career and the 2002 Winter Olympics\n\nAn's early career as a short track speed skater began in the early 2000s. He was part of the South Korean national team and competed in several international events. At the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, An won his first Olympic medal, a bronze in the 500 meters.\n\n**National team 'recommendation system'**\n\nDuring the 2002 Winter Olympics, An was involved in a controversy surrounding the South Korean national team's \"recommendation system.\" The system allowed coaches to recommend athletes for selection, which led to allegations of favoritism and discrimination. An was one of the athletes affected by this system, and he later spoke out against it.\n\n#### 2002–2005, KNSU and Non-KNSU\n\nFrom 2002 to 2005, An was part of the Korea Skating Union (KNSU), the governing body for short track speed skating in South Korea. During this period, he competed in several international events and won several medals. However, An also faced opposition from the KNSU, which he claimed was due to his outspoken nature.\n\n#### 2005, Conflict with Korea Skating Union\n\nIn 2005, An had a publicized conflict with the KNSU. He claimed that the union was trying to control his career and limit his opportunities. The conflict led to An's departure from the KNSU, and he began competing as an independent athlete.\n\n#### 2006 Winter Olympics\n\nAt the 2006 Winter Olympics in Torino, An won his second Olympic medal, a silver in the 500 meters. He also competed in the 1000 meters and 1500 meters events, finishing in fifth and sixth place, respectively.\n\n#### After Torino\n\nAfter the 2006 Winter Olympics, An continued to compete in international events. He won several medals, including a gold in the 1000 meters at the 2007 World Championships. However, An's career was also marked by injuries, including a concussion he suffered in 2008.\n\n### 2010s\n\n#### 2010, Conflict with Korea Skating Union\n\nIn 2010, An had another conflict with the KNSU. He claimed that the union was trying to sabotage his career and limit his opportunities. The conflict led to An's decision to leave South Korea and compete as a Russian athlete.\n\n#### Naturalization to Russia\n\nIn 2010, An naturalized as a Russian citizen. He claimed that he had been offered a better opportunity by the Russian Federation and that he believed it would be beneficial for his career.\n\n#### 2011, Conflict with the South Korean coaches\n\nIn 2011, An had a conflict with the South Korean coaches who had trained him earlier in his career.

The reform aims to limit the powers of the Supreme Court and restructure the appointment process of judges, sparking widespread protests and concerns about the rule of law and the country's democratic foundations.\n\nBackground\n\n### Israeli Supreme Court and Judicial Review\n\nThe Israeli Supreme Court, established in 1948, is the highest court in Israel, with the power to review laws, government actions, and decisions of lower courts. The court's authority is based on the notion of judicial review, which allows it to strike down laws and government actions deemed unconstitutional or ultra vires (beyond the power of the government).\n\nThe Supreme Court has played a crucial role in shaping Israel's democratic system, serving as a check on the power of the executive and legislative branches. However, its decisions have also been the subject of controversy, particularly in cases involving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the country's relationship with the Arab minority.\n\n### 1992 Constitutional Revolution and its Discontents\n\nIn 1992, Israel's Basic Laws were amended, effectively creating a constitutional framework for the country. The amendment, known as the \"Basic Law: The Government\", established the Supreme Court as the final authority on constitutional matters. However, the amendment also introduced a provision allowing the Knesset (Israel's parliament) to override the court's decisions by a two-thirds majority.\n\nThe 1992 amendment was seen as a compromise between the country's right-wing and left-wing factions, but it has since been criticized for its potential to undermine the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary.\n\n### 2018–2022 Israeli Political Crisis and 2022 Legislative Election\n\nIn 2018, Israel's government was rocked by a corruption scandal, leading to the resignation of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. However, the scandal also exposed deep divisions within the country's political establishment, with the left-wing and right-wing factions increasingly polarized.\n\nThe 2022 legislative election saw the Likud party, led by Benjamin Netanyahu, emerge as the largest party in the Knesset. However, the election also saw the rise of several smaller parties, including the Religious Zionism party, which campaigned on a platform of radical change to the country's judicial system.\n\nLegislative History\n\n### HCJ 5658/23 Movement for Quality Government in Israel v. Knesset (2024)\n\nIn 2024, the Israeli Supreme Court heard a petition filed by the Movement for Quality Government in Israel, a non-profit organization, against the Knesset. The petition challenged the constitutionality of the proposed judicial reform bill, arguing that it would undermine the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law.\n\nThe court's decision, which is still pending, is expected to have significant implications for the country's judicial system and the relationship between the judiciary and the legislature.\n\nProposed Changes\n\n### Judicial Selection\n\nThe proposed judicial reform bill aims to restructure the appointment process of judges in Israel. Under the current system, judges are appointed by a committee consisting of the President of Israel, the Speaker of the Knesset, and the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.\n\nThe proposed system would replace the committee with a new body, consisting of the President of Israel, the Speaker of the Knesset, and a representative of the government. This change is aimed at increasing the influence of the government in the appointment process, but it has been criticized for undermining the independence of the judiciary.\n\n### Current System\n\nUnder the current system, judges are appointed for life, and their independence is protected by the Basic Laws. The appointment process is also subject to a rigorous review process, which ensures that judges are appointed based on their qualifications and expertise.\n\n### Proposed System\n\nThe proposed system would replace the current committee with a new body, which would be responsible for selecting candidates for the Supreme Court. The new body would be composed of the President of Israel, the Speaker of the Knesset, and a representative of the government. This change would give the government a significant role in the appointment process, potentially undermining the independence of the judiciary.\n\n### Arguments in Favor of the Reform\n\nSupporters of the reform argue that it would increase transparency and accountability in the appointment process, ensuring that judges are appointed based on their qualifications and expertise. They also argue that the reform would reduce the influence of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, who has been seen as too powerful in recent years.\n\n### Arguments Against the Reform\n\nOpponents of the reform argue that it would undermine the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law. They argue that the proposed system would give the government too much influence in the appointment process, potentially leading to the appointment of judges who are not qualified or who are beholden to the government.\n\n### Government Legal Advisors\n\nThe proposed reform also aims to change the role of government legal advisors in the appointment process. Under the current system, government legal advisors are responsible for providing legal advice to the government on the appointment of judges. The proposed system would replace them with a new body, composed of the President of Israel, the Speaker of the Knesset, and a representative of the government.\n\n### Constitutional Review\n\nThe proposed reform also aims to change the process of constitutional review in Israel. Under the current system, the Supreme Court has the power to review laws and government actions, striking them down if they are deemed unconstitutional. The proposed system would replace the Supreme Court with a new body, composed of the President of Israel, the Speaker of the Knesset, and a representative of the government.\n\n### Override Clause\n\nThe proposed reform also aims to change the override clause in the Basic Laws. Under the current system, the Knesset can override the Supreme Court's decisions by a two-thirds majority. The proposed system would replace this with a new clause, which would allow the government to override the court's decisions without the need for a two-thirds majority.\n\n### Abolition of \"Unreasonableness\" Grounds\n\nThe proposed reform also aims to abolish the grounds of \"unreasonableness\" in the court's decisions. Under the current system, the court can strike down laws and government actions if they are deemed unreasonable. The proposed system would replace this with a new clause, which would allow the government to override the court's decisions without the need for a two-thirds majority.\n\n### Arguments in Favor of the Reform\n\nSupporters of the reform argue that it would increase transparency and accountability in the appointment process, ensuring that judges are appointed based on their qualifications and expertise. They argue that the reform would also reduce the influence of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, who has been seen as too powerful in recent years.\n\n### Arguments Against the Reform\n\nOpponents of the reform argue that it would undermine the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law. They argue that the proposed system would give the government too much influence in the appointment process, potentially leading to the appointment of judges who are not qualified or who are beholden to the government.\n\nStatus of the Attorney-General\n\nThe proposed reform also aims to change the role of the Attorney-General in Israel. Under the current system, the Attorney-General is responsible for advising the government on legal matters and ensuring that the government complies with the law. The proposed system would replace the Attorney-General with a new body, composed of the President of Israel, the Speaker of the Knesset, and a representative of the government.\n\nReactions\n\n### National\n\nThe proposed judicial reform has been met with widespread criticism from the Israeli public, with many expressing concerns about the potential impact on the country's democratic system and the rule of law. The opposition parties have also spoken out against the reform, arguing that it would undermine the independence of the judiciary and the government's accountability.\n\n### International\n\nThe international community has also reacted with concern to the proposed judicial reform, with many countries and organizations expressing worries about the potential impact on Israel's democratic system and human rights. The United States, in particular, has expressed concerns about the reform, with the US State Department stating that it would \"undermine the independence of the judiciary\".\n\n### Connection to the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict\n\nThe proposed judicial reform has also been linked to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with many arguing that it would undermine the ability of the court to rule on issues related to the conflict. The court has played a crucial role in shaping the relationship between Israel and the Palestinians, and its independence is seen as essential for ensuring that the conflict is resolved through a just and equitable process.\n\nSuspension and Overruling\n\nThe proposed judicial reform has been met with widespread criticism, and there are concerns that it could be used to suspend or overrule the court's decisions. The Knesset has passed a law that would allow it to override the court's decisions, and there are fears that this could be used to suppress dissent and undermine the rule of law.\n\nSee also\n\n* Israeli judicial system\n* Israeli Supreme Court\n* Judicial review\n* Rule of law\n* Democracy\n* Human rights\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n* Israeli Ministry of Justice: Judicial Reform\n* Israeli Supreme Court: Judicial Reform\n* Movement for Quality Government in Israel: Judicial Reform\n* US State Department: Israel and the Palestinians", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The protests have become one of the most significant challenges to the Islamic Republic's authority since the 2009 Green Movement.\n\nBackground\n\n### Condition of women and the Islamic Republic\n\nIran has a complex and often contentious relationship with women's rights. While the country's constitution guarantees equal rights for men and women, in practice, women face significant restrictions and inequalities. These include mandatory hijab laws, limitations on education and employment opportunities, and reduced access to healthcare and other social services. The Islamic Republic's morality police, known as the Gasht-e Ershad, are responsible for enforcing these laws and have been accused of using excessive force and violence against women who do not comply.\n\n### Protest movements under the Islamic Republic\n\nPrior to the Mahsa Amini protests, there have been several notable protest movements in Iran, including the 2009 Green Movement, which was sparked by widespread allegations of electoral fraud and resulted in significant repression and violence by the authorities. More recently, there have been protests in 2017 and 2018 over economic conditions, as well as in 2022 over the country's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n### Mahsa Amini's arrest and death in custody\n\nMahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish Iranian woman, was arrested by the morality police on September 13, 2022, for allegedly not properly wearing her hijab. She was taken to a police station in Tehran, where she died three days later, on September 16, 2022. The authorities claimed that Amini had suffered a heart attack and had been unconscious for several hours before being taken to the hospital, but her family and many others disputed this account, suggesting that she had been beaten to death by the police.\n\nProtests\n\n### Slogans and greviances\n\nThe protests that erupted in response to Amini's death have been characterized by a wide range of slogans and grievances, including demands for women's rights, an end to the morality police, and the prosecution of those responsible for Amini's death. Protesters have also called for the overthrow of the Islamic Republic and the establishment of a new, democratic government.\n\n### Iranian public opinion\n\nPublic opinion in Iran has been deeply divided over the protests, with some people expressing support for the protesters and others condemning them as \"rioters\" and \"saboteurs.\" The authorities have used a range of tactics to try to suppress the protests, including arresting and detaining protesters, shutting down social media and other forms of communication, and using violence to disperse crowds.\n\n### Protest techniques\n\nProtesters have employed a range of techniques to try to bring attention to their cause and to challenge the authorities, including mass demonstrations, sit-ins, and occupations of public spaces. They have also used social media to organize and mobilize support, as well as to share information and coordinate their activities.\n\n### Civil boycotts\n\nSome protesters have also called for civil boycotts of government services and institutions, including schools, universities, and government offices. This has resulted in significant disruptions to normal life in Iran, as well as to the country's economy.\n\n### Media Western coverage\n\nThe protests have received significant coverage in the Western media, with many outlets highlighting the bravery and determination of the protesters, as well as the brutality and repression of the authorities.

The history of women's cinema spans over a century, from the early days of silent films to the present day, with significant milestones and contributions from women filmmakers around the world.\n\n**Famous Women in Film History**\n\nWomen have been involved in the film industry since its inception, with many making significant contributions to the art form. Some of the most famous women in film history include:\n\n### **Silent Films**\n\nDuring the silent film era, women like Alice Guy-Blaché, Lois Weber, and Mabel Normand were pioneers in the industry, directing, writing, and acting in films. Alice Guy-Blaché is often credited as the first female film director, with over 700 films to her credit. Lois Weber was a prolific director and writer, known for her socially conscious films that addressed issues like poverty and women's rights.\n\n### **Classical Hollywood**\n\nThe classical Hollywood era saw the rise of women like Dorothy Arzner, who was the first woman to direct a major Hollywood film, \"Dance, Girl, Dance\" (1940). Other notable women filmmakers of this era include Jean Renoir's wife, Dido Freire, and Ida Lupino, who directed several films, including \"Hard, Fast and Beautiful\" (1951).\n\n### **Experimental and Avant-Garde Cinema**\n\nThe 1960s and 1970s saw the rise of experimental and avant-garde cinema, with women like Maya Deren, Shirley Clarke, and Chantal Akerman pushing the boundaries of traditional storytelling. Maya Deren's \"Meshes of the Afternoon\" (1943) is a classic example of experimental cinema, while Shirley Clarke's \"The Cool World\" (1963) is a groundbreaking work that explores themes of identity and social justice.\n\n**Impact on Society**\n\nWomen's cinema has had a significant impact on society, challenging traditional norms and stereotypes, and providing a platform for women's voices and experiences.\n\n### **Impact of Second-Wave Feminism**\n\nThe second-wave feminist movement of the 1960s and 1970s saw a surge in women's cinema, with films that addressed issues like women's rights, reproductive rights, and domestic violence. Films like \"Maid in America\" (1972) and \"The Stepford Wives\" (1975) explored the experiences of women in a patriarchal society.\n\n### **Representing Sexuality**\n\nWomen's cinema has also played a significant role in representing sexuality, with films like \"Blue is the Warmest Color\" (2013) and \"Carol\" (2015) exploring themes of desire, identity, and love. These films have challenged traditional representations of women and their bodies, offering a more nuanced and complex portrayal of female sexuality.\n\n### **Fear of Entering Cinematography**\n\nDespite the progress made, women continue to face barriers and biases in the film industry, with many citing fear and intimidation as reasons for not entering cinematography. A study by the Sundance Institute found that women are less likely to direct films, and when they do, they are more likely to be relegated to low-budget or independent films.\n\n### **Statistics**\n\nAccording to a report by the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media, women make up only 13% of directors, 20% of writers, and 25% of editors in the film industry. These numbers have remained relatively stagnant over the past few decades, highlighting the need for greater diversity and inclusion in the industry.\n\n### **Documentaries**\n\nDocumentaries have played a significant role in showcasing women's experiences and perspectives, with films like \"The Mask You Live In\" (2015) and \"RBG\" (2018) exploring themes of identity, power, and social justice.\n\n### **Female Filmmakers as Feminists**\n\nMany female filmmakers see themselves as feminists, using their work as a platform to challenge patriarchal norms and stereotypes. Filmmakers like Ava DuVernay and Greta Gerwig are using their films to explore themes of identity, power, and social justice, offering a more nuanced and complex portrayal of women and their experiences.\n\n### **Celluloid Ceiling**\n\nThe term \"celluloid ceiling\" was coined by film critic and historian, Molly Haskell, to describe the glass ceiling that women face in the film industry. Despite the progress made, women continue to face barriers and biases, with many citing fear and intimidation as reasons for not entering cinematography.\n\n**North America**\n\nWomen's cinema has flourished in North America, with significant contributions from women filmmakers in Canada and the United States.\n\n### **Canada**\n\nCanadian women filmmakers like Patricia Rozema and Deepa Mehta have made significant contributions to the industry, with films like \"Monsieur Lazhar\" (2011) and \"Belly of the Beasts\" (2007) exploring themes of identity, power, and social justice.\n\n### **United States**\n\nAmerican women filmmakers like Ava DuVernay and Greta Gerwig have emerged as leaders in the industry, with films like \"Selma\" (2014) and \"Lady Bird\" (2017) exploring themes of identity, power, and social justice.\n\n### **Hollywood**\n\nHollywood has traditionally been a male-dominated industry, with women facing significant barriers and biases. However, women like Dorothy Arzner and Ida Lupino have made significant contributions to the industry, with films like \"Dance, Girl, Dance\" (1940) and \"Hard, Fast and Beautiful\" (1951) exploring

The election marked the country's 37th presidential election and the 23rd since the end of the dictatorship in 1985.\n\n# Background\nThe 2022 Brazilian general election was held in the context of a highly polarized and divisive political environment. The country had been experiencing a severe economic crisis, with high inflation, unemployment, and a significant increase in poverty. The COVID-19 pandemic had also had a profound impact on the economy and society, exacerbating existing social and economic inequalities.\n\nThe election was also marked by a deepening divide between the ruling Bolsonaro administration and the opposition, which had been calling for impeachment and the end of the president's term. The opposition was led by a coalition of parties, including the Workers' Party (PT), the Brazilian Socialist Party (PSB), and the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (MDB).\n\n# Electoral system\n## Voters\nThe 2022 Brazilian general election was held on the basis of universal suffrage, with all Brazilian citizens aged 18 or older eligible to vote. The country has a total of 212 million citizens, with approximately 150 million registered voters.\n\n## Candidates and political parties\nA total of 154 candidates ran for president in the first round, representing 19 different parties. The main candidates were Jair Bolsonaro (PL), the incumbent president, and Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT), the former president and leader of the opposition.\n\n## Procedure\nThe 2022 Brazilian general election was held in two rounds. In the first round, voters chose their preferred candidate for president, with the top two candidates advancing to the second round. In the second round, voters chose between the top two candidates.\n\n# Presidential candidates\n## Candidates in runoff\nThe two candidates who advanced to the runoff were Jair Bolsonaro (PL) and Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT).

The collapse was the result of a combination of factors, including a decline in the bank's stock value, a sharp increase in the cost of borrowing, and a significant loss on the sale of the bank's assets.\n\n**Background**\n\nSilicon Valley Bank was a commercial bank that specialized in providing financial services to the technology industry, particularly to startups and venture capital firms. The bank was founded in 1983 by Robert W. Herfort, Roger King, and Paul Grossman, and it quickly gained a reputation as a trusted lender to the tech industry. Over the years, SVB expanded its services to include a range of financial products, including deposit accounts, loans, and investment banking services.\n\n**Collapse**\n\nThe collapse of Silicon Valley Bank began on March 9, 2023, when the bank's stock price plummeted by 60% in a single day, due to concerns about the bank's financial health. The decline in the bank's stock value was triggered by a combination of factors, including a sharp increase in the cost of borrowing and a significant loss on the sale of the bank's assets.\n\n### Losses\n\nSVB had invested heavily in the US Treasury market, where the bank had purchased bonds with maturities in the next 10-15 years, which were then sold at a significant loss when interest rates increased. The bank had also held a large portfolio of venture capital-backed securities, which were also sold at a loss. As a result, SVB reported losses of over $1.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022, and the bank's stock price began to decline sharply.\n\n### Instability\n\nThe collapse of SVB's stock price triggered a wave of withdrawals from the bank, as depositors rushed to withdraw their funds. The bank's management attempted to reassure depositors that their deposits were safe, but the bank's financial situation continued to deteriorate.\n\n### Receivership\n\nOn March 10, 2023, the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) took control of SVB, citing \"unprecedented\" conditions that threatened the stability of the financial system. The bank was placed into receivership, and a receiver was appointed to manage the bank's assets and liabilities.\n\n### Acquisition\n\nOn March 10, 2023, First Citizens Bank acquired SVB's assets and deposits, marking the end of the bank's 40-year history. The acquisition was made possible by a $2.5 billion investment by the US Treasury Department, which was provided to stabilize the financial system.\n\n**Effects**\n\nThe collapse of Silicon Valley Bank had significant effects on a range of stakeholders, including customers, shareholders, and the financial system as a whole.\n\n### Customers\n\nSVB's customers were among the hardest hit by the bank's collapse, as they faced uncertainty about the status of their deposits. The bank's receivership initially led to concerns that customers might lose access to their funds, but ultimately, customers were able to access their funds through the FDIC, which insured deposits up to $250,000.\n\n### Shareholders\n\nSVB's shareholders were also significantly affected by the bank's collapse, as the bank's stock price plummeted to almost zero. The bank's collapse resulted in significant losses for investors, including venture capital firms and individual investors.\n\n### Financial system\n\nThe collapse of SVB had significant implications for the financial system, as it highlighted concerns about the stability of the banking system. The bank's collapse led to increased scrutiny of the banking industry, and regulators began to review the bank's risk management practices.\n\n### Legal actions\n\nThe collapse of SVB also led to a range of legal actions, including lawsuits against the bank's management and directors. The lawsuits alleged that the bank's management had failed to properly manage the bank's risk, leading to the bank's collapse.\n\n**Reactions**\n\nThe collapse of Silicon Valley Bank triggered a range of reactions from regulators, politicians, and industry leaders.\n\n### Official responses\n\nRegulators and politicians responded quickly to the bank's collapse, with the FDIC and the Federal Reserve taking steps to stabilize the financial system. The US Treasury Department also announced a $2.5 billion investment to support the acquisition of SVB by First Citizens Bank.\n\n### Debate over government intervention\n\nThe collapse of SVB sparked a debate about the role of government intervention in the financial system. Some argued that the government should have taken more decisive action to prevent the bank's collapse, while others argued that the government had acted appropriately to stabilize the financial system.\n\n### Debate about causes\n\nThe collapse of SVB also sparked a debate about the causes of the bank's collapse. Some argued that the bank's collapse was caused by a combination of factors, including a decline in the US Treasury market and a sharp increase in the cost of borrowing. Others argued that the bank's collapse was caused by a failure of risk management, and that the bank's management had failed to properly manage the bank's risk.\n\n**See also**\n\n* List of banks in the United States\n* List of failed banks in the United States\n* Banking crisis of 2007-2008\n* Great Depression", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.
