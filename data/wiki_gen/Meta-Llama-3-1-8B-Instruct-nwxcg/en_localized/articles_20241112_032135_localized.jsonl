The chronology of these events is complex and multifaceted, spanning several centuries and involving numerous key dates and developments.\n\n**Chronologies of the Crusades in print**\n\nHistorians have long sought to chronicle the events of the Crusades, with various scholars producing influential works on the subject. Some notable examples include:\n\n* **William of Tyre's History of Deeds Done Beyond the Sea**, a 12th-century chronicle that provides valuable insights into the early Crusades.\n* **The History of the Franks** by Gregory of Tours, a 6th-century work that lays the groundwork for future historians.\n* **The Chronicle of the Crusades** by Ernoul and Bernard le Trésorier, a 13th-century compilation of accounts from various sources.\n\nThese works, along with many others, have contributed to our understanding of the Later Crusades and their significance in world history.\n\n**13th century**\n\n### Prior events\n\nThe Later Crusades built upon the momentum of the earlier Crusades, which began in the 11th century. Key events that paved the way for the Later Crusades include:\n\n* The capture of Jerusalem in 1099\n* The establishment of the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem\n* The Second Crusade (1147-1149)\n* The Third Crusade (1187-1192)\n\nThese events set the stage for the complex web of alliances and rivalries that would shape the Later Crusades.\n\n### 1270\n\nIn 1270, the Seventh Crusade was launched under the leadership of King Louis IX of France. The crusade aimed to free the Holy Land from Muslim control, but ultimately ended in defeat. King Louis IX died in the campaign, and the crusade's failure led to a decline in the popularity of the Crusades in Western Europe.\n\n### 1280\n\nThe 1280s saw a resurgence of interest in the Crusades, particularly in Italy and the Holy Roman Empire. In 1287, the city of Acre, the last major Christian stronghold in the Holy Land, was besieged by the Mamluk Sultan Qalawun. The siege was eventually lifted, but the city's defenses were significantly weakened.\n\n### 1290\n\nIn 1290, King Edward I of England launched the Ninth Crusade, which aimed to retake Acre and other lost territories. The crusade ultimately failed, and Edward I returned to England without achieving his objectives.\n\n## 14th century\n\n### 1300\n\nThe early 14th century saw a decline in the popularity of the Crusades, as the Black Death ravaged Europe and the papacy faced internal conflicts. In 1307, King Philip IV of France launched a campaign against the Knights Templar, a powerful military order that had played a significant role in the Crusades.\n\n### 1310\n\nIn 1310, the Knights Templar were officially dissolved by Pope Clement V, and many of their properties were seized by the crown. This marked a significant turning point in the history of the Crusades, as the Knights Templar had been a key player in the earlier Crusades.\n\n### 1320\n\nThe 1320s saw a brief resurgence of interest in the Crusades, particularly in the Holy Roman Empire. In 1325, the city of Acre was captured by the Mamluk Sultan Al-Nasir Muhammad, marking the end of the last major Christian stronghold in the Holy Land.\n\n### 1330\n\nIn 1330, the papacy launched a campaign to recruit new crusaders, but the effort ultimately failed. The 1330s saw a decline in the popularity of the Crusades, as the papacy faced internal conflicts and the Black Death continued to ravage Europe.\n\n### 1340\n\nIn 1340, the Ottoman Empire, under the leadership of Sultan Orhan I, began to expand its territories into the Balkans. This marked a significant turning point in the history of the Crusades, as the Ottoman Empire would eventually become a major player in the region.\n\n### 1350\n\nThe 1350s saw a decline in the popularity of the Crusades, as the papacy faced internal conflicts and the Black Death continued to ravage Europe. In 1355, the city of Constantinople was besieged by the Ottoman Empire, but the siege was eventually lifted.\n\n### 1360\n\nIn 1360, the papacy launched a campaign to recruit new crusaders, but the effort ultimately failed. The 1360s saw a decline in the popularity of the Crusades, as the papacy faced internal conflicts and the Ottoman Empire continued to expand its territories.\n\n### 1370\n\nIn 1370, the city of Acre was captured by the Mamluk Sultan Al-Mansur Ali, marking the end of the last major Christian stronghold in the Holy Land.\n\n### 1380\n\nThe 1380s saw a decline in the popularity of the Crusades, as the papacy faced internal conflicts and the Ottoman Empire continued to expand its territories. In 1389, the Battle of Kosovo was fought between the Ottoman Empire and the Serbian Empire, marking a significant turning point in the history of the Balkans.\n\n### 1390\n\nIn 1390, the papacy launched a campaign to recruit new crusaders, but the effort ultimately failed. The 1390s saw a decline in the popularity of the Crusades, as the papacy faced internal conflicts and the Ottoman Empire continued to expand its territories.\n\n## 15th century\n\n### 1400\n\nThe 15th century saw a significant decline in the popularity of the Crusades, as the papacy faced internal conflicts and the Ottoman Empire continued to expand its territories. In 1402, the Ottoman Empire, under the leadership of Sultan Bayezid I, launched a campaign against the Black Death, but the effort ultimately failed.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

From ancient indigenous cultures to colonial rule and modern-day nationhood, Taiwan's history reflects the diverse influences of its various rulers and settlers.\n\n**Prehistory**\n\nThe earliest known human habitation on Taiwan dates back to the Paleolithic era, around 20,000 years ago. The indigenous peoples of Taiwan, known as the Taiwanese aborigines, were a diverse group of hunter-gatherer societies that developed complex social systems and cultures. Archaeological evidence suggests that these early inhabitants of Taiwan were skilled fishermen and farmers, and that they developed a sophisticated understanding of the island's natural environment.\n\n**Chinese contact and settlement**\n\nThe first recorded contact between Taiwanese aborigines and the Chinese was in the 13th century, when Chinese fishermen and traders began to visit the island. However, it was not until the 17th century that the Chinese began to establish more permanent settlements on the island. In 1623, a Chinese pirate named Zheng Zhilong established a foothold on the island, and in 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a trading post on the island, which they named Formosa.\n\n**Dutch and Spanish colonies (1624–1668)**\n\n### Contact and establishment\n\nThe Dutch established a strong presence on the island, and by 1629, they had established a fortified settlement at Fort Zeelandia. The Dutch colonizers brought with them new technologies, crops, and farming methods, which transformed the island's agriculture and economy. However, the Dutch also imposed their own language, culture, and social systems on the Taiwanese people, leading to tensions and conflicts.\n\n### Piracy\n\nThe Dutch period saw a significant increase in piracy on the island, as Chinese pirates and other groups took advantage of the island's strategic location and the Dutch's relatively weak military presence. The most notorious pirate of this period was Koxinga, a Chinese pirate who would later play a significant role in the conquest of Taiwan.\n\n### Japanese trade\n\nDuring the early 17th century, the Japanese also established trade relations with the island, and some Japanese traders and fishermen settled on the island. However, the Japanese trade was relatively small and short-lived, and it was eventually disrupted by the arrival of the Dutch.\n\n### Spanish Formosa\n\nIn 1626, the Spanish established a settlement on the island, which they named Formosa. However, the Spanish presence on the island was short-lived, as the Dutch eventually forced them to abandon their settlement.\n\n### Dutch colonization\n\nThe Dutch established a strong and lasting presence on the island, and by the mid-17th century, they had established a well-organized and efficient colonial administration. The Dutch brought with them new technologies, crops, and farming methods, which transformed the island's agriculture and economy. However, the Dutch also imposed their own language, culture, and social systems on the Taiwanese people, leading to tensions and conflicts.\n\n### Chinese settlers\n\nDuring the Dutch period, Chinese settlers began to arrive on the island, attracted by the economic opportunities and the relative freedom offered by the Dutch. These Chinese settlers played an important role in the island's economy, and they eventually became a significant part of the island's population.\n\n### End of Dutch rule\n\nIn 1661, Koxinga, the Chinese pirate, conquered the island and established the Kingdom of Tungning. The Dutch were forced to abandon their settlement and withdraw from the island.\n\n**Kingdom of Tungning (1661–1683)**\n\n### Conquest\n\nKoxinga, the Chinese pirate, conquered the island and established the Kingdom of Tungning. Koxinga's conquest of the island was the result of a long and complex struggle, and it marked the beginning of a new era in the island's history.\n\n### Retreat to Taiwan\n\nIn 1662, Koxinga retreated to Taiwan and established his capital at Tainan. The Kingdom of Tungning was a Chinese state, and it was established to provide a base for Koxinga's pirate activities.\n\n### Sinicization\n\nDuring the Kingdom of Tungning period, the Taiwanese people began to adopt Chinese customs, language, and culture. This process, known as sinicization, transformed the island's culture and society.\n\n### Shi Lang\n\nIn 1683, Shi Lang, a Qing dynasty official, defeated Koxinga's son and established the Qing dynasty's control over the island. Shi Lang's victory marked the end of the Kingdom of Tungning and the beginning of a new era in the island's history.\n\n### End of Zheng rule\n\nThe Kingdom of Tungning ended with the defeat of Koxinga's son, and the Zheng dynasty came to an end. The Zheng dynasty had a significant impact on the island's history and culture, and it laid the foundation for the modern Taiwanese state.\n\n**Qing dynasty (1683–1895)**\n\n### Annexation\n\nIn 1683, the Qing dynasty annexed the island, and it became a province of the Qing empire.

The country is situated in North America and shares borders with Canada to the north and Mexico to the south. The United States is the world's fourth-largest country by total area and the third-largest by land area.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe name \"United States\" was chosen by the Founding Fathers at the Philadelphia Convention in 1787 to replace the term \"United Colonies.\" The name was suggested by John Langdon of New Hampshire and was later adopted by the Continental Congress. The term \"United States\" was first used in the Declaration of Independence, signed in 1776.\n\n**History**\n\n### Indigenous peoples\n\nThe first inhabitants of the Americas, the indigenous peoples, migrated from Asia across the Bering Land Bridge at least 15,000 years ago. Over time, various tribes developed and flourished across the continent, each with their own distinct culture, language, and traditions. The arrival of European explorers in the 15th century led to the displacement, marginalization, and decimation of Native American populations.\n\n### European settlement and conflict (1607–1765)\n\nThe first successful English settlement was established at Jamestown, Virginia in 1607. Other European settlements followed, including the Pilgrims at Plymouth, Massachusetts in 1620. As European settlement expanded, conflicts arose between colonists and Native American tribes over land and resources. The English, French, and Spanish vied for control of the continent, leading to wars and skirmishes.\n\n### American Revolution and the early republic (1765–1800)\n\nTensions between the British government and the American colonies led to the outbreak of the American Revolution in 1775. The colonies declared independence in 1776, and the Continental Army, led by George Washington, fought against the British Army. The Treaty of Paris in 1783 recognized American independence and established the United States as a sovereign nation.\n\n### Westward expansion and Civil War (1800–1865)\n\nAs the United States expanded westward, conflicts arose over issues such as slavery, states' rights, and economic interests. The Mexican-American War (1846-1848) resulted in the United States gaining control of a significant amount of land, including present-day California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and parts of present-day Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Wyoming. The Civil War (1861-1865) divided the country, with the Union ultimately prevailing over the Confederacy.\n\n### Post–Civil War era (1865–1917)\n\nThe Reconstruction Era (1865-1877) aimed to rebuild the South and ensure the rights of African Americans. The late 19th century saw the Industrial Revolution, immigration, and the growth of cities. The United States emerged as a global power, with significant economic, cultural, and military influence.\n\n### Rise as a superpower (1917–1945)\n\nThe United States entered World War I in 1917 and played a significant role in the Allied victory. The Roaring Twenties followed, marked by economic growth, cultural innovation, and social change. The Great Depression (1929-1939) and World War II (1939-1945) tested the nation's resilience and resolve.\n\n### Cold War (1945–1991)\n\nThe post-war period saw the emergence of the Cold War, a decades-long rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union. The United States played a leading role in the creation of NATO and the containment of communism in Europe. The Cuban Missile Crisis (1962) brought the world to the brink of nuclear war.\n\n### Contemporary (1991–present)\n\nThe end of the Cold War marked a new era of global politics. The United States played a leading role in international relations, including the Gulf War (1990-1991) and the War on Terror (2001-present). The country has continued to evolve, with significant changes in demographics, technology, and politics.\n\n**Geography**\n\n### Climate\n\nThe United States has a diverse climate, ranging from tropical in Hawaii and southern Florida to arctic in Alaska. The continental United States experiences a temperate climate, with cold winters and warm summers.\n\n### Biodiversity and conservation\n\nThe United States is home to a wide range of ecosystems, including forests, grasslands, deserts, and wetlands. The country has a rich biodiversity, with many native species found nowhere else in the world. Conservation efforts have been made to protect and preserve these ecosystems and species.\n\n**Government and politics**\n\n### National government\n\nThe United States is a federal republic, with a president serving as head of state and head of government. The Congress is bicameral, consisting of the House of Representatives and the Senate. The Supreme Court is the highest court in the land.\n\n### Political parties\n\nThe two major parties are the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. Other parties, such as the Libertarian Party and the Green Party, also exist.\n\n### Subdivisions\n\nThe United States is divided into 50 states, each with its own government. The District of Columbia is a federal district that serves as the capital.\n\n### Foreign relations\n\nThe United States has diplomatic relations with over 180 countries and is a member of various international organizations, including the United Nations and NATO.\n\n### Military\n\nThe United States has a large and technologically advanced military, with a global presence. The country is a nuclear power and has a significant role in international security.\n\n### Law enforcement and criminal justice\n\nThe United States has a complex system of law enforcement and criminal justice, with federal, state, and local agencies responsible for enforcing laws and dispensing justice.\n\n**Economy**\n\n### Science, technology, spaceflight, and energy\n\nThe United States has a strong economy, with significant advancements in science, technology, spaceflight, and energy. The country has a vibrant tech industry and is a leader in fields such as computing, biotechnology, and renewable energy.\n\n### Transportation\n\nThe United States has a well-developed transportation network, with a comprehensive system of roads, highways, and airports.

Born in Domremy, a small village in northeastern France, Joan is considered one of the most iconic figures in French history. Her life is a testament to courage, faith, and determination, inspiring people around the world to this day.\n\n**Birth and Historical Background**\n\nJoan of Arc was born on January 6, 1412, in Domremy, a small village in the Lorraine region of northeastern France. Her parents, Jacques and Isabelle Arc, were peasant farmers who lived a simple life. At the time of Joan's birth, the Hundred Years' War was raging between France and England, with the English having occupied large parts of northern France. The war was a significant source of instability and insecurity, which would later shape Joan's life and destiny.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nGrowing up in Domremy, Joan was raised in a devoutly Catholic family. She received a basic education at home, learning to read and write in Latin and French. Joan's childhood was marked by her strong faith and her devotion to the Catholic Church. She often visited the local church and attended Mass, where she would receive communion and pray for guidance.\n\nAs a young girl, Joan experienced a series of visions, which she believed were messages from God. These visions would later become a crucial aspect of her life and a source of strength for her. In her visions, Joan saw saints, angels, and other figures, who guided her and instructed her on her mission. Her visions were often accompanied by a sense of peace and conviction, which she believed was a sign of God's presence in her life.\n\n**Chinon**\n\nIn 1429, Joan traveled to the city of Chinon, the capital of the province of Touraine, to meet with Charles VII, the King of France. Charles was struggling to regain control of his kingdom, which was occupied by the English. Joan's mission was to convince Charles to lead his army to Orléans, a city that was under siege by the English. At the time, Orléans was a strategic location, as it controlled access to the Loire River and was a key city in the region.\n\nJoan arrived at Chinon in May 1429 and met with Charles VII. She presented her case to him, explaining that God had chosen her to lead the French army to victory. Charles, who was skeptical at first, was eventually convinced by Joan's conviction and determination. He agreed to let her lead the army to Orléans, and on April 27, 1429, Joan and her forces set out from Chinon.\n\n**Military Campaigns**\n\nJoan's military campaigns were marked by several key victories and a few setbacks. Her bravery and determination inspired her troops, who fought with renewed enthusiasm and confidence.\n\n### Orléans\n\nOn April 29, 1429, Joan and her forces arrived at Orléans, which was under siege by the English. The city was surrounded by the English army, and the French were in a desperate situation. Joan, however, was undaunted. She led her forces to the city gates, where she was met by a contingent of French soldiers. Together, they launched a surprise attack on the English, driving them back and lifting the siege. The city was liberated, and the French were able to regroup and reorganize their forces.\n\n### Loire Campaign\n\nAfter the liberation of Orléans, Joan and her forces set out to drive the English from the Loire Valley. Their campaign was marked by several victories, as they defeated the English at Les Tourelles and other key locations. The English, who were under pressure from the French, began to retreat, and the French were able to regain control of the region.\n\n### Coronation and Siege of Paris\n\nIn July 1429, Joan and her forces marched on Paris, which was still occupied by the English. The city was a key location, as it controlled access to the Seine River and was a strategic location in the region. Joan and her forces laid siege to the city, hoping to drive the English out. The siege was long and bloody, but eventually, the English were forced to surrender. On August 8, 1429, Joan entered the city, where she was greeted as a hero.\n\n### Campaign against Perrinet Gressart\n\nIn 1429, Joan and her forces launched a campaign against Perrinet Gressart, a French lord who had allied himself with the English. Gressart was a key figure in the region, and his defeat was seen as a significant blow to the English. Joan and her forces defeated Gressart at the Battle of Patay, where he was killed.\n\n### Siege of Compiègne and Capture\n\nIn 1430, Joan and her forces laid siege to the city of Compiègne, which was occupied by the Burgundians. The siege was long and bloody, but eventually, the Burgundians were forced to surrender. However, Joan was captured by the Burgundia", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The event took place on November 26, 2022, at the TD Garden in Boston, Massachusetts. It was the thirty-fifth annual Survivor Series event and the first WarGames event to be held under the Survivor Series banner.\n\n**Production**\n\n### Background\n\n\nThe idea of WarGames was a concept created by WWE in 1987 for its World Wrestling Federation (WWF) promotion. The concept involved two teams of four wrestlers, with two members from the WWF Championship team and two members from the WWF Intercontinental Championship team. The objective was for the team from the WWF Championship side to escape a steel cage surrounding the ring, while the opposing team would try to prevent them from escaping.\n\nThe concept proved to be successful for the WWF, and it became a staple event for the promotion. However, the concept went into hiatus in 1992. In 2022, WWE revived the concept, announcing its return as part of the Survivor Series event.\n\n### Storylines\n\n\nThe main storylines heading into Survivor Series: WarGames involved several feuds between wrestlers from the Raw and SmackDown brands.

The Shahnameh is a comprehensive history of Iran from the creation of the world to the Arab conquest of Persia in the 7th century. The Pishdadian dynasty is said to have ruled over Iran from the time of the creation of the world to the reign of Jamshid, the 30th king of the dynasty.\n\n**Origins, Etymology and Sources**\n\nThe origins of the Pishdadian dynasty are shrouded in legend and myth. The name \"Pishdadian\" is derived from the Persian words \"pish\" meaning \"first\" and \"dadian\" meaning \"son of\". According to the Shahnameh, the Pishdadians were the first dynasty of Iranian kings, and their rulers were the descendants of the mythical hero Kayumars, the first human being created by the god Ahura Mazda.\n\nThe Shahnameh is the primary source of information about the Pishdadian dynasty. Ferdowsi, the author of the Shahnameh, drew heavily from earlier Persian and Arabic sources, including the works of the great Persian historian Tabari. However, the Shahnameh is not a strictly historical work, and its accounts of the Pishdadian dynasty are often embellished with mythological and legendary elements.\n\n**The Shahnameh and Zoroastrian Tradition**\n\nThe Shahnameh is a comprehensive history of Iran from the creation of the world to the Arab conquest of Persia in the 7th century. The Pishdadian dynasty is said to have ruled over Iran from the time of the creation of the world to the reign of Jamshid, the 30th king of the dynasty. According to the Shahnameh, the Pishdadians were the rulers of a golden age of peace and prosperity, during which the Iranian people lived in harmony with the gods and with nature.\n\n### Overview\n\nThe Pishdadian dynasty is said to have been founded by Kayumars, the first human being created by the god Ahura Mazda. Kayumars is said to have lived at a time when the world was still in its early stages of creation, and the earth was still inhabited by giants and monsters. According to the Shahnameh, Kayumars was a wise and just ruler, who brought peace and prosperity to the Iranian people.\n\n### The Kings\n\nThe Pishdadian dynasty is said to have consisted of 30 kings, each of whom ruled over Iran for a period of time. The kings of the Pishdadian dynasty are said to have been the descendants of Kayumars, and each one was said to have been a wise and just ruler. Some of the most notable kings of the Pishdadian dynasty include:\n\n* Jamshid, the 30th king of the dynasty, who is said to have been the greatest of all the Pishdadian kings.\n* Tahmuras, the 24th king of the dynasty, who is said to have been a just and wise ruler.\n* Kavian, the 26th king of the dynasty, who is said to have been a brave and powerful warrior.\n\n**Tabari and the Muslim Narratives**\n\nThe Muslim historian Tabari wrote extensively about the Pishdadian dynasty in his comprehensive history of the world, \"The History of the Prophets and Kings\". According to Tabari, the Pishdadian dynasty was a succession of kings who ruled over Iran from the time of the creation of the world to the reign of Jamshid.\n\n### The First Pishdadian Kings and the Conflict with Iblis\n\nAccording to Tabari, the first Pishdadian kings were the descendants of Kayumars, and they ruled over Iran in a time of peace and prosperity. However, the Pishdadian kings were also said to have been at war with Iblis, the great enemy of humanity. According to the Muslim narratives, Iblis was a powerful demon who had been created by God to tempt and deceive humanity. The Pishdadian kings are said to have fought bravely against Iblis and his minions, but ultimately they were unable to defeat them.\n\n### From Jam al-Shidh to Zaw: al-Dahhak and War with the Turks\n\nThe Muslim historian Tabari also wrote about the later Pishdadian kings, including Jam al-Shidh, who is said to have been the 20th king of the dynasty. According to Tabari, Jam al-Shidh was a wise and just ruler who brought peace and prosperity to the Iranian people. However, he was also at war with the Turks, who were a powerful and aggressive people. The Pishdadian kings are said to have fought bravely against the Turks, but ultimately they were unable to defeat them.\n\n**Significance**\n\nThe Pishdadian dynasty is significant in Iranian history and culture, as it represents the earliest known dynasty of Iranian kings. The Pishdadian dynasty is also significant in the context of Persian mythology and literature, as it is mentioned in the Shahnameh, one of the greatest works of Persian literature. The Pishdadian dynasty is also significant in the context of Zoroastrianism, as it is said to have been founded by Kayumars, the first human being created by the god Ahura Mazda.\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The Pishdadian dynasty is also known as the Kayumarian dynasty.\n* The Shahnameh is a comprehensive history of Iran from the creation of the world to the Arab conquest of Persia in the 7th century.\n* The Pishdadian dynasty is said to have ruled over Iran from the time of the creation of the world to the reign of Jamshid, the 30th king of the dynasty.\n\n**References**\n\n* Ferdowsi, Abol Qasem.

The counteroffensive began on 6 September 2022, and it marked a significant turning point in the Russo-Ukrainian War, with Ukrainian forces making significant gains against the Russian military.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe city of Kharkiv, located in northeastern Ukraine, had been a key battleground in the early stages of the Russo-Ukrainian War. In February 2022, Russian forces launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine, with Kharkiv being one of the first major cities to come under attack. The city was heavily shelled and bombed, and Ukrainian forces were forced to retreat from the surrounding areas. By April 2022, Russian forces had established a significant presence in the Kharkiv Oblast, and Ukrainian forces were largely confined to the city itself.\n\n**Prelude**\n\nIn the months leading up to the counteroffensive, Ukrainian forces had been gathering momentum, with significant gains made in the Donbas region. The Ukrainian military had also received significant supplies of equipment and ammunition from Western countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom. These supplies, combined with the experience and expertise gained in the early stages of the war, had enabled the Ukrainian military to develop a robust and effective strategy for the counteroffensive.\n\n**Counteroffensive**\n\n### First Phase (6–12 September 2022)\n\n#### Initial Advance\n\nThe counteroffensive began on 6 September 2022, with Ukrainian forces launching a series of attacks against Russian positions in the Kharkiv Oblast. The initial advance was led by the Ukrainian Ground Forces, with support from artillery and air forces. The Ukrainian military made significant gains in the first 24 hours, capturing several key villages and towns.\n\n#### Breakthrough\n\nOn 8 September 2022, Ukrainian forces made a major breakthrough, capturing the town of Balakliya, which was located in the northwestern part of the Kharkiv Oblast. The capture of Balakliya was a significant blow to Russian forces, as it gave Ukrainian forces a key foothold in the area and allowed them to launch further attacks against Russian positions.\n\n#### Russian Withdrawal from Kharkiv Oblast West of Oskil River\n\nIn the aftermath of the breakthrough, Russian forces began to withdraw from the Kharkiv Oblast, west of the Oskil River. The withdrawal was a significant blow to Russian forces, as it gave Ukrainian forces a significant advantage in terms of territory and allowed them to launch further attacks against Russian positions.\n\n#### Other Gains and Casualties\n\nIn the first phase of the counteroffensive, Ukrainian forces made significant gains, capturing several key villages and towns. However, Russian forces also suffered significant casualties, with reports of numerous killed and wounded. The exact number of casualties is unclear, but it is believed to be in the hundreds.\n\n### Battle of Shevchenkove\n\nOn 10 September 2022, Ukrainian forces launched an attack against Russian positions in the village of Shevchenkove, which was located in the northwestern part of the Kharkiv Oblast. The attack was led by the Ukrainian Ground Forces, with support from artillery and air forces. The battle was intense, with both sides suffering significant casualties. However, ultimately, Ukrainian forces emerged victorious, capturing the village and pushing Russian forces back.\n\n### Second Phase (13 September–1 October 2022)\n\n#### Oskil River Crossing\n\nOn 14 September 2022, Ukrainian forces launched an attack against Russian positions in the northwestern part of the Kharkiv Oblast, with the aim of crossing the Oskil River. The attack was led by the Ukrainian Ground Forces, with support from artillery and air forces. The crossing was successful, with Ukrainian forces establishing a foothold on the western bank of the river.\n\n#### Encirclement and Recapture of Lyman\n\nIn the aftermath of the crossing, Ukrainian forces began to encircle Russian positions in the city of Lyman, which was located in the northwestern part of the Kharkiv Oblast. The encirclement was successful, and on 2 October 2022, Ukrainian forces recaptured the city, marking a significant turning point in the counteroffensive.\n\n**Reactions**\n\n### Russia\n\nThe Russian government reacted to the counteroffensive with a mixture of surprise and anger. Russian officials accused Ukrainian forces of violating a ceasefire agreement and of using Western-supplied equipment to launch attacks against Russian positions. The Russian military also launched a series of attacks against Ukrainian positions, in an attempt to regain", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

However, things take a dark turn when they discover that the park's animatronic characters, including Freddy Fazbear, Bonnie the Bunny, Chica the Chicken, and Foxy the Pirate Fox, have become haunted and start to attack them. As the friends try to survive the night, they uncover the dark secrets behind the park's history and the true nature of the animatronic characters.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Josh Hamilton as Mike\n* Elizabeth Lail as Abby\n* Piper Curda as Tom\n* Greg Germann as Mark\n* Piper Reese as Maddie\n* Kat Conner Byrne as Karen\n* Elizabeth Thornton as Karen's friend\n\n**Production**\n\n### Development\n\nThe film was first announced in 2015, with Seth Grahame-Smith and Chris McKenna set to write and produce the project. However, the film's development was slow due to the complexity of the franchise's lore and the need to ensure that the film stayed true to the game's spirit.\n\n### Casting\n\nThe casting process was a crucial part of the film's production. The filmmakers held auditions for the main roles, and the cast was finalized in 2020. Josh Hamilton, Elizabeth Lail, and Piper Curda were cast as the main characters, while Greg Germann and Kat Conner Byrne were cast in supporting roles.\n\n### Filming\n\nThe film was shot on location in the United States, with principal photography taking place in 2021. The production team built a replica of the Carnival of Screams amusement park, which served as the main set for the film. The animatronic characters were built and designed by a team of special effects experts, who worked closely with the filmmakers to ensure that the characters were as terrifying as possible.\n\n### Music\n\nThe film's score was composed by Brian Tyler, who is known for his work on horror films such as The Conjuring and Insidious. The score is a mix of electronic and orchestral elements, which helps to create a sense of tension and unease throughout the film.\n\n**Release**\n\n### Marketing\n\nThe film's marketing campaign was launched in 2022, with a series of trailers and TV spots released to promote the film. The campaign focused on the film's horror elements, with a emphasis on the animatronic characters and their terrifying abilities.\n\n### Home media\n\nThe film was released on digital platforms on March 1, 2023, and on DVD and Blu-ray on April 15, 2023. The home media release included a series of bonus features, including a behind-the-scenes documentary and a commentary track with the filmmakers.\n\n**Reception**\n\n### Box office\n\nThe film was a commercial success, grossing over $125 million at the domestic box office and over $250 million worldwide. The film's success was due in part to its strong marketing campaign and its appeal to fans of the video game franchise.\n\n### Critical response\n\nThe film received generally positive reviews from critics, with many praising its horror elements and its faithfulness to the game's spirit. However, some critics felt that the film was too formulaic and that it lacked the complexity and depth of the game. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 72% approval rating, with an average rating of 6.5/10.\n\n### Accolades\n\nThe film won several awards, including the 2023 People's Choice Award for Favorite Horror Movie and the 2023 Fangoria Chainsaw Award for Best Wide-Release Film.\n\n**Sequel**\n\nA sequel to the film is currently in development, with the filmmakers working on a script and preparing for production.

The rebellion was a significant challenge to the Russian government and military leadership, and it had far-reaching consequences for the country and the world.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Yevgeny Prigozhin and the Wagner Group\n\nYevgeny Prigozhin, a Russian businessman and military commander, founded the Wagner Group in 2014. The PMC has been involved in various military conflicts and operations, including in Ukraine, Syria, and Africa. Prigozhin was a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin and had been involved in several high-profile military interventions.\n\n### Internal tensions during the invasion of Ukraine\n\nAs the Russian invasion of Ukraine continued, tensions between Prigozhin and the Russian military leadership began to emerge. Prigozhin had been critical of the Russian military's handling of the conflict, and he had expressed frustration with the lack of resources and support for his troops.\n\n### Order to integrate Wagner\n\nIn June 2023, the Russian Defense Ministry issued an order to integrate the Wagner Group into the Russian military. Prigozhin and his officers were ordered to report to the Defense Ministry and to prepare for reassignment to regular military units. However, Prigozhin and his commanders refused to comply with the order, citing concerns about their troops' safety and the potential for them to be used as cannon fodder.\n\n### Planning the rebellion\n\nOver the next several days, Prigozhin and his officers began to secretly plan a rebellion against the Russian government. They formed an alliance with several other military units and groups, including the 141st Military Base in Rostov-on-Don, which was home to the 10th Army of the Russian Ground Forces.\n\n**Rebellion**\n\n### Prigozhin's statements\n\nOn June 23, 2023, Prigozhin released a statement in which he accused the Russian government of attempting to undermine the Wagner Group and to destroy its reputation. He also claimed that the government had been planning to take control of the Wagner Group's assets and to dissolve the PMC.\n\n### Rebukes of the government and allegation of an attack on Wagner\n\nIn a separate statement, Prigozhin accused the Russian government of planning to attack the Wagner Group and its commanders. He claimed that the government had been working to discredit the Wagner Group and to undermine its authority.\n\n### Call to rebellion\n\nOn June 24, 2023, Prigozhin released a statement in which he called on his troops to rise up against the Russian government. He claimed that the government had been attempting to destroy the Wagner Group and to undermine its authority, and he called on his troops to defend themselves and to fight back.\n\n**Capture of Rostov-on-Don**\n\nOn June 25, 2023, Prigozhin and his troops captured Rostov-on-Don, a major city in southern Russia. The city was home to the 141st Military Base, which was a key location for the Russian military.\n\n**Advance towards Moscow**\n\nOver the next several days, Prigozhin and his troops advanced towards Moscow, the capital city of Russia. They were met with resistance from Russian military units, but they were able to push forward and to gain control of several key locations.\n\n**Security measures**\n\nAs Prigozhin and his troops advanced towards Moscow, the Russian government began to take security measures to prevent them from reaching the capital. The government deployed troops and military equipment to key locations, and it also imposed a state of emergency in several regions.\n\n**Events in Syria**\n\nMeanwhile, events were unfolding in Syria, where the Wagner Group had been involved in military operations. On June 26, 2023, the Syrian government announced that it had entered into a ceasefire agreement with the Wagner Group, which would allow the group to withdraw its troops from the country.\n\n**Resolution**\n\nOn June 27, 2023, Prigozhin and his troops reached the outskirts of Moscow, but they were met with fierce resistance from Russian military units. After several days of fighting, Prigozhin and his troops were forced to withdraw from the city.\n\n**Reactions**\n\n### Domestic\n\n* **Vladimir Putin's address**: In a televised address, Putin condemned the Wagner Group rebellion and accused Prigozhin of treason. He also announced that a full investigation would be launched into the rebellion.\n* **Other government-aligned figures**: Several other government-aligned figures, including the head of the Russian State Duma, condemned the rebellion and called for Prigozhin to be brought to justice.\n* **Anti-war opposition and anti-government armed groups**: The anti-war opposition and anti-government armed groups in Russia welcomed the rebellion and called for further action against the government.\n* **Ultranationalists and milbloggers**: The ultranationalists and milbloggers in Russia were divided in their reaction to the rebellion, with some supporting Prigozhin and others condemning him.\n* **Wider public**: The wider public in Russia was also divided in their reaction to the rebellion, with some supporting Prigozhin and others condemning him.\n\n### International\n\n* **NATO countries**: The NATO countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, condemned the Wagner Group rebellion and called for a peaceful resolution to the conflict.\n* **Other countries**: Several other countries, including China and India, also condemned the rebellion and called for a peaceful resolution to the conflict.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\n### Fallout and restoring order\n\nIn the aftermath of the rebellion, the Russian government launched a full investigation into the events that led to the uprising. The government also took steps to restore order and to rebuild the military.\n\n### Subsequent statements\n\nAfter the rebellion, Prigozhin released several statements in which he claimed that the rebellion had been a success and that the government had been forced to negotiate with him.\n\n### Fate of the Wagner Group and Yevgeny Prigozhin\n\n* **Closure of criminal case and initial statements**: The Russian government launched a criminal case against Prigozhin and several other high-ranking officials of the Wagner Group. Prigozhin was initially placed under house arrest, but he was later released.\n* **Crackdown on Wagner, alleged purges and related arrests**: The Russian government launched a crackdown on the Wagner Group, arresting several high-ranking officials and seizing the group's assets.\n* **Prigozhin's return to Russia**: After several months in exile, Prigozhin returned to Russia and was welcomed by the government.\n* **Death of Prigozhin and Utkin**: In 2024, Prigozhin and his close ally, Dmitry Utkin, were killed in a helicopter crash.\n\n**Measures of NATO countries**\n\nThe NATO countries took several measures in response to the Wagner Group rebellion, including:\n\n* **Sanctions**: The United States, the United Kingdom, and France imposed sanctions on several high-ranking officials of the Russian government and the Wagner Group.\n* **Military aid**: The United States and other NATO countries provided military aid to Ukraine and other countries that were affected by the rebellion.\n* **Diplomatic efforts**: The NATO countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, launched diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict and to promote peace in the region.\n\n**Analysis**\n\nThe Wagner Group rebellion was a significant event that had far-reaching consequences for Russia and the world. The rebellion highlighted the tensions between the Russian government and the private military companies, and it raised questions about the role of these companies in the country's military strategy.\n\n### Political\n\nThe rebellion was a significant challenge to the Russian government and its military leadership, and it had far-reaching consequences for the country's politics.

Nonmetals are typically found in the upper right corner of the periodic table and are characterized by their tendency to form anions, which are atoms or molecules that have gained one or more electrons. Nonmetals are also known for their ability to form covalent bonds, which are bonds between two or more atoms that share one or more pairs of electrons.\n\n**Definition and Applicable Elements**\n\nThe term \"nonmetal\" is not a formal classification in the periodic table, but rather a descriptive term that is used to distinguish these elements from metals. The following elements are generally considered to be nonmetals:\n\n* Halogens (Group 17): fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), iodine (I), and astatine (At)\n* Noble gases (Group 18): helium (He), neon (Ne), argon (Ar), krypton (Kr), xenon (Xe), and radon (Rn)\n* Other nonmetals: carbon (C), nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), phosphorus (P), sulfur (S), and selenium (Se)\n\n**General Properties**\n\n### Physical Properties\n\nNonmetals typically have a few distinct physical properties:\n\n* **Low melting points**: Nonmetals typically have low melting points, which are the temperatures at which they change from a solid to a liquid state.\n* **Low boiling points**: Nonmetals also have low boiling points, which are the temperatures at which they change from a liquid to a gas state.\n* **Low density**: Nonmetals are generally less dense than metals, meaning they have a lower mass per unit volume.\n* **High ionization energy**: Nonmetals have high ionization energies, which are the energies required to remove an electron from an atom or molecule.\n\n### Allotropes\n\nSome nonmetals have allotropes, which are different physical forms of the same element. For example:\n\n* Carbon has several allotropes, including diamond, graphite, and fullerenes.\n* Phosphorus has several allotropes, including white phosphorus and red phosphorus.\n* Sulfur has several allotropes, including orthorhombic sulfur and monoclinic sulfur.\n\n**Chemical Properties**\n\nNonmetals are characterized by their chemical properties, including:\n\n* **Oxidation states**: Nonmetals can exhibit a range of oxidation states, which are the charges on an atom or molecule when it gains or loses electrons.\n* **Reactivity**: Nonmetals are generally less reactive than metals, but some can be highly reactive in certain situations.\n* **Acid-base behavior**: Nonmetals can exhibit acid-base behavior, which involves the transfer of a proton (H+ ion) from one molecule to another.\n\n**Complications**\n\nNonmetals can exhibit a range of complications, including:\n\n### First Row Anomaly\n\nThe first row of the periodic table, which includes hydrogen, helium, and lithium, exhibits a range of unusual properties that do not follow the expected trends. This is known as the first row anomaly.\n\n### Secondary Periodicity\n\nNonmetals can exhibit secondary periodicity, which involves the repetition of properties and trends in the periodic table.\n\n### Higher Oxidation States\n\nSome nonmetals can exhibit higher oxidation states, which involve the loss of more than one electron per atom.\n\n### Multiple Bond Formation\n\nNonmetals can form multiple bonds, which involve the sharing of more than one pair of electrons between atoms.\n\n### Property Overlaps\n\nNonmetals can exhibit property overlaps, which involve the sharing of properties between different elements or groups of elements.\n\n**Types**\n\nNonmetals can be classified into several types, including:\n\n### Noble Gases\n\nThe noble gases are a group of nonmetals that are unreactive and stable.

The film is based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name and serves as a part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Morbius follows the story of a scientist who experiments with a cure for blood disorders, but ends up transforming himself into a vampire-like creature.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film follows the story of Dr. Michael Morbius, a brilliant scientist who suffers from a rare blood disorder known as porphyria. Morbius is desperate to find a cure for his condition and becomes obsessed with the idea of creating an anti-aging serum. He teams up with his friend and colleague, Adrian Toomes, to develop a serum that will cure his condition.\n\nHowever, their experiment goes horribly wrong, and Morbius becomes infected with a vampiric blood disorder. The transformation is depicted as a rapid and intense process, with Morbius experiencing extreme physical and emotional pain. As he struggles to cope with his new condition, Morbius discovers that he has developed the ability to transform into a creature with enhanced strength, speed, and agility.\n\nDespite his newfound powers, Morbius is horrified by what he has become and seeks out a cure. He becomes convinced that the only way to reverse the effects of the serum is to find a way to destroy the creature that has taken over his body. Morbius sets out on a journey to find a cure, but his transformation has made him a monster, and he must confront the darkness within himself.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Jared Leto as Dr. Michael Morbius\n* Adria Arjona as Martine Bancroft\n* Jared Harris as Dr. Emil Nicholas\n* Al Madrigal as Alberto\n* Tyrese Gibson as Martin Bank\n* Michael Keaton as Adrian Toomes / Vulture\n\n**Production**\n\n### Development\n\nThe idea for a Morbius film was first conceived in the early 2010s, when Sony Pictures Entertainment acquired the rights to the character from Marvel Comics. At the time, the project was intended to be a part of Sony's Spider-Man universe, but it eventually developed into a separate entity. In 2017, Jared Leto was announced as the lead actor in the film, with Daniel Espinosa set to direct.\n\n### Pre-production\n\nPre-production on the film began in 2018, with Leto and Espinosa working closely together to develop the script. The film's story was heavily influenced by the comic book series, but it also introduced new characters and plot elements. The production team spent several months researching the story and developing the characters.\n\n### Filming\n\nPrincipal photography on the film began in March 2019 and wrapped up in August of the same year. The film was shot on location in various parts of the United Kingdom, including London and Oxford. The production team used a combination of traditional and digital filmmaking techniques to bring the film's visual effects to life.\n\n### Post-production\n\nPost-production on the film began immediately after filming wrapped up. The visual effects team worked tirelessly to create the film's elaborate action sequences and creature designs. The audio team also worked closely with the production team to create an immersive soundtrack that would complement the film's visual elements.\n\n**Music**\n\nThe film's soundtrack was composed by Jonathon Sela and features a mix of orchestral and electronic elements. The soundtrack was released in conjunction with the film's theatrical release and received positive reviews from critics.\n\n**Marketing**\n\nThe film's marketing campaign was led by Sony Pictures Entertainment and Marvel Studios. The campaign included a series of trailers and TV spots that showcased the film's action sequences and creature designs. The campaign also included a social media campaign that encouraged fans to share their own Morbius-inspired artwork and cosplay.\n\n**Release**\n\n### Theatrical\n\nThe film was released in theaters on April 1, 2022, in the United States and Canada. The film received a wide release, with over 3,000 theaters in the United States alone. The film's opening weekend gross was $39.4 million, making it the fourth-highest opening weekend for a superhero film in 2022.\n\n### Home media\n\nThe film was released on digital platforms on May 24, 2022, and on Blu-ray and DVD on June 7, 2022. The home media release included a number of bonus features, including deleted scenes, behind-the-scenes footage, and a commentary track with the cast and crew.\n\n**Reception**\n\n### Box office\n\nThe film's box office performance was mixed. The film grossed over $166 million worldwide, but it was also one of the most expensive films ever made, with a production budget of over $200 million. The film's box office performance was seen as a disappointment by some, but it was also seen as a success by others, given the film's ambitious scope and visual effects.\n\n### Critical response\n\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics. The film's action sequences and creature designs were widely praised, but the film's story and characters were criticized for being convoluted and underdeveloped. The film holds a 29% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 241 reviews, with an average rating of 4.6/10.\n\n### Internet memes\n\nThe film's release was accompanied by a number of internet memes and jokes. The film's title character, Michael Morbius, became a meme, with many people joking about the film's poor box office performance and the character's questionable fashion sense. The film's marketing campaign was also the subject of several memes, including a joke about the film's trailer being \"the most boring trailer of the year.\"\n\n**Future**\n\nAlthough the film's box office performance was disappointing, there are plans to continue the Morbius franchise. In an interview, Jared Leto stated that he would be interested in revisiting the character in the future, potentially with a new script and a new direction. Additionally, there have been rumors of a sequel or spin-off film, but nothing has been officially announced.\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The film's script was heavily influenced by the comic book series, but it also introduced new characters and plot elements.\n* The film's production team spent several months researching the story and developing the characters.\n* The film's marketing campaign was led by Sony Pictures Entertainment and Marvel Studios.\n* The film's soundtrack was composed by Jonathon Sela and features a mix of orchestral and electronic elements.\n\n**References**\n\n* This article includes information from various sources, including interviews with the cast and crew, and reviews from critics.\n* The article also includes information from the film's official website and social media channels.\n\n**External links**\n\n* Morbius (film) on IMDb\n* Morbius (film) at Rotten Tomatoes", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.
