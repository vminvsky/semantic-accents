The storm caused significant damage and loss of life, making it one of the most devastating hurricanes of the 2022 Atlantic hurricane season.\n\n**Meteorological history**\n\nHurricane Ian formed on September 23, 2022, in the western Caribbean Sea, approximately 480 miles (770 km) south-southeast of Grand Cayman Island. The storm was a tropical depression at the time, but it quickly strengthened into a tropical storm and then a hurricane as it moved northwestward. Ian reached Category 5 strength on September 24, with maximum sustained winds of 160 mph (260 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 940 mbar (27.76 inHg).\n\nAs Ian continued to move northwestward, it began to interact with a low-pressure system over the eastern Gulf of Mexico. This interaction caused the storm to slow down and move more northward, which allowed it to maintain its strength and intensity. On September 27, Ian made landfall in southwestern Florida as a Category 4 hurricane, bringing catastrophic winds and storm surge to the region.\n\n**Preparations**\n\n### Caribbean\n\n**Jamaica**\n\nThe Government of Jamaica issued a tropical storm warning for the island on September 23, 2022, as Ian approached. Residents were advised to take precautions and prepare for the storm's arrival. The Jamaica Meteorological Service issued a flash flood warning for the island on September 25, as heavy rainfall from Ian caused flooding in several areas.\n\n**Cayman Islands**\n\nThe Government of the Cayman Islands issued a hurricane warning for the islands on September 24, 2022, as Ian approached. Residents were advised to take precautions and prepare for the storm's arrival. The Cayman Islands Meteorological Service issued a storm surge warning for the islands on September 26, as Ian's storm surge caused flooding in several areas.\n\n**Cuba**\n\nThe Government of Cuba issued a tropical storm warning for the island on September 25, 2022, as Ian approached. Residents were advised to take precautions and prepare for the storm's arrival. The Cuban Meteorological Service issued a flash flood warning for the island on September 27, as heavy rainfall from Ian caused flooding in several areas.\n\n### United States\n\n**Florida**\n\nThe National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane warning for the Florida Keys and a tropical storm warning for the rest of southern Florida on September 26, 2022, as Ian approached. Residents were advised to take precautions and prepare for the storm's arrival. The Florida Department of Emergency Management issued a mandatory evacuation order for several counties in southwestern Florida on September 27, as Ian made landfall.\n\n**Georgia**\n\nThe National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm warning for coastal Georgia on September 27, 2022, as Ian approached. Residents were advised to take precautions and prepare for the storm's arrival.\n\n**South Carolina**\n\nThe National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm warning for coastal South Carolina on September 27, 2022, as Ian approached. Residents were advised to take precautions and prepare for the storm's arrival.\n\n**Elsewhere**\n\nThe National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane watch for the Alabama coast on September 27, 2022, as Ian approached. Residents were advised to take precautions and prepare for the storm's arrival.\n\n### The Bahamas\n\nThe Government of the Bahamas issued a tropical storm warning for the islands on September 25, 2022, as Ian approached. Residents were advised to take precautions and prepare for the storm's arrival.\n\n**Impact**\n\n### Caribbean\n\n**Southern Caribbean and South America**\n\nIan's outer rain bands affected several countries in the southern Caribbean and South America, causing flash flooding and power outages in several areas.\n\n**Cayman Islands**\n\nIan's storm surge caused flooding in several areas of the Cayman Islands, including the capital city of George Town. The storm also caused widespread power outages and damage to buildings and infrastructure.\n\n**Cuba**\n\nIan's heavy rainfall caused flooding in several areas of Cuba, including the capital city of Havana. The storm also caused widespread power outages and damage to buildings and infrastructure.\n\n### United States\n\n**Florida**\n\nIan's storm surge caused catastrophic damage to several coastal areas of Florida, including Fort Myers and Sanibel Island. The storm also caused widespread power outages and flooding in several areas.\n\n**The Carolinas**\n\nIan's outer rain bands caused flash flooding and power outages in several areas of the Carolinas.\n\n**Elsewhere**\n\nIan's outer rain bands caused power outages and damage to buildings and infrastructure in several areas of Alabama and Mississippi.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\n### Cuba\n\nThe Government of Cuba reported that at least 5 people were killed and several injured in the storm. The storm also caused widespread damage to buildings and infrastructure.\n\n### United States\n\nThe National Guard was deployed to several areas of Florida to assist with relief efforts. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) also activated its emergency operations center to coordinate relief efforts.\n\n**Damage estimates**\n\nThe damage from Ian is estimated to be in the billions of dollars. The exact amount of damage is still being tallied.\n\n**Depiction in media**\n\nIan was widely covered in the media, with numerous news outlets providing updates and coverage of the storm's impact.\n\n**Retirement**\n\nThe World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has announced that the name Ian will be retired from the list of Atlantic hurricane names due to the storm's significant impact.\n\n**See also**\n\n* 2022 Atlantic hurricane season\n* List of Category 4 Atlantic hurricanes\n* List of Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is based on information from the National Hurricane Center and other official sources.\n* The article is subject to revision and update as new information becomes available.\n\n**References**\n\n* National Hurricane Center.

One approach to understanding this process is through the lens of network theory and the diffusion of innovation. This article explores the concept of diffusion of innovation and its application to the Christianization of the Roman Empire.\n\nNetwork theory and Diffusion of Innovation as an Approach\n\nDiffusion of innovation is a concept that refers to the process by which an idea or innovation is spread and adopted by a social system. This process involves the transmission of information, attitudes, or behaviors from one individual or group to another. Network theory, which examines the structure and behavior of social networks, provides a framework for understanding the diffusion of innovation.\n\nInnovation\n\nInnovation refers to the introduction of a new idea, product, process, or service that meets a specific need or solves a problem. In the context of the Christianization of the Roman Empire, the innovation was the spread of Christianity as a new faith. The Christian message of salvation and redemption offered a new perspective on the afterlife, and its spread was facilitated by the mobility of people, trade, and travel.\n\nAlternative Approaches\n\nWhile the diffusion of innovation provides a useful framework for understanding the Christianization of the Roman Empire, it is not the only approach. Other perspectives, such as the role of imperial politics, social and economic factors, and cultural exchange, also contribute to our understanding of this process.\n\nFailure of Diffusion\n\nNot all innovations or ideas spread successfully through a social system. The failure of diffusion can be attributed to various factors, including lack of relative advantage, social norms, and regulatory measures. In the context of the Christianization of the Roman Empire, the initial failure of diffusion can be attributed to the lack of understanding and the social stigma associated with Christianity.\n\nFive Characteristics of Diffusion\n\nResearch has identified five key characteristics that facilitate the diffusion of innovation: relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability, and observability. These characteristics play a crucial role in the spread of Christianity in the Roman Empire.\n\nRelative Advantage\n\nRelative advantage refers to the benefits or superiority of an innovation over existing practices or products. In the context of Christianity, the relative advantage was the promise of salvation and redemption offered by Jesus Christ. This message resonated with people, particularly those who felt disillusioned with the traditional Roman pantheon and its emphasis on power and wealth.\n\nAlms\n\nThe practice of giving alms, or charitable donations, was an important aspect of Christian charity and a means of demonstrating relative advantage. Alms were seen as a way to help the poor and marginalized, and the act of giving was considered a virtuous act that earned divine rewards. This emphasis on almsgiving helped to promote the Christian message and attract adherents.\n\nSlavery through the fifth century\n\nSlavery was a pervasive institution in the Roman Empire, and Christians were among the most vocal critics of this practice. Early Christian leaders, such as the apostle Paul, emphasized the importance of treating slaves with dignity and respect. The Christian message of equality and compassion helped to undermine the institution of slavery, and many Christians actively worked to free slaves and promote their rights.\n\nGeography and a scale-free network\n\nThe geography of the Roman Empire played a significant role in the diffusion of Christianity. The empire's extensive network of roads, trade routes, and urban centers facilitated the transmission of ideas and people. A scale-free network, characterized by a small number of highly connected nodes, was particularly effective in spreading the Christian message. Key cities, such as Rome, Antioch, and Jerusalem, served as hubs for the dissemination of Christian ideas and practices.\n\nCompatibility and complexity\n\nCompatibility refers to the degree to which an innovation is consistent with existing values, norms, and practices. Christianity, with its emphasis on love, compassion, and forgiveness, was seen as compatible with the values of many Romans. However, the complexity of Christian doctrine, particularly the concept of the Trinity, posed challenges for many adherents.\n\nTrialability\n\nTrialability refers to the ease with which an innovation can be tested or experimented with. In the context of Christianity, trialability was facilitated by the early Christian practice of baptism and the Eucharist. These sacraments allowed individuals to experience and participate in the Christian community, thereby testing its teachings and values.\n\nReinvention\n\nThe process of reinvention, or the transformation of an innovation to fit local needs and contexts, was an important aspect of Christianization in the Roman Empire. Early Christians adapted their message and practices to suit the cultural, social, and economic contexts of different regions.\n\nInnovators of the first century\n\nThe innovators of the first century, including Jesus and his followers, laid the foundation for the Christian movement. Their message of love, compassion, and redemption resonated with people and helped to establish a community of believers.\n\nEarly adopters in the first and second centuries\n\nThe early adopters of Christianity, who followed the teachings of Jesus and his apostles, played a crucial role in spreading the Christian message. They risked persecution, social ostracism, and even death to promote the faith and establish Christian communities.\n\nThird century early majority\n\nThe third century saw the emergence of the early majority, who adopted Christianity as a result of the efforts of early Christian missionaries and the growth of Christian communities. This period saw significant social, economic, and cultural changes in the Roman Empire, which contributed to the spread of Christianity.\n\nSexual morality\n\nThe Christian emphasis on sexual morality, particularly the concept of marriage and the role of women, posed challenges for many Romans. The early Christian practice of virginity and celibacy, which was seen as a means of devotion to God, was viewed with suspicion and even ridicule by some.\n\nPersecution\n\nPersecution, or the act of violently opposing or suppressing a particular group or idea, was a significant challenge for early Christians. The Roman Empire, with its emphasis on power and authority, saw Christianity as a threat to its values and institutions. Christians were subjected to various forms of persecution, including imprisonment, torture, and execution.\n\nConstantine as Opinion Leader\n\nThe conversion of Emperor Constantine to Christianity in the fourth century marked a significant turning point in the Christianization of the Roman Empire. As an opinion leader, Constantine used his power and influence to promote Christianity, issue edicts in its favor, and provide financial support to its spread. His conversion helped to legitimize Christianity and paved the way for its widespread adoption throughout the empire.\n\nNotes\n\nThis article provides a comprehensive overview of the Christianization of the Roman Empire through the lens of diffusion of innovation. The five key characteristics of diffusion, relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability, and observability, are essential for understanding the spread of Christianity in this context. The article also highlights the role of innovation, network theory, and the failure of diffusion in the Christianization process.\n\nReferences\n\nThis article does not include any references as per the requirements.\n\nBibliography\n\nThe following books and articles were consulted during the research for this article:\n\n* Everett M.

From its pre-colonial days as a home to indigenous Australians to its current status as a global city, Sydney has undergone significant transformations over the centuries. This article provides a comprehensive timeline of the major events, developments, and milestones in the history of Sydney.\n\n**Pre-Colonial**\n\nThe first human presence in the Sydney area dates back to around 30,000 years ago, during the last Ice Age. The indigenous Aboriginal people of the Eora Nation inhabited the region, with their traditional lands stretching from the Blue Mountains in the west to Botany Bay in the east. The Eora people had a rich and complex culture, with a strong spiritual connection to the land and a sophisticated understanding of the natural environment.\n\n**18th–19th centuries**\n\n### 1770s–1790s\n\nIn 1770, British explorer James Cook landed at Botany Bay, marking the first European sighting of the Sydney area. Over the next few decades, British explorers and sailors visited the region, with some establishing temporary settlements. In 1788, the British government decided to establish a penal colony in Australia, with Sydney Cove chosen as the site for the new settlement.\n\n### 1800s–1840s\n\nThe British settlement in Sydney quickly grew, with the establishment of a governor, a council, and a system of government. The first free settlers arrived in 1793, and the colony began to expand, with the establishment of farms, businesses, and infrastructure. In 1810, the government granted the first land grants to settlers, and the city began to take shape.\n\n### 1850s–1890s\n\nDuring the mid-19th century, Sydney underwent significant growth and development, driven by the discovery of gold in New South Wales in 1851. The gold rush brought thousands of people to the city, leading to rapid urbanization and the establishment of new businesses, services, and infrastructure. The city's population grew from around 10,000 in 1851 to over 150,000 by the end of the century.\n\n**20th century**\n\n### 1900s–1940s\n\nThe 20th century saw significant changes in Sydney, with the city becoming a major hub for industry, trade, and tourism. The city's population continued to grow, with the suburbs expanding rapidly. In 1923, the city's rail network was electrified, and the first electric trams were introduced. During World War II, Sydney played an important role in the war effort, with the city's harbor serving as a key naval base.\n\n### 1950s–1990s\n\nThe post-war period saw significant growth and development in Sydney, with the city becoming a major hub for international business, finance, and trade. The city's economy diversified, with the establishment of new industries, including technology, tourism, and services. In 1967, the city's iconic Opera House was opened, becoming a symbol of Australian culture and a major tourist attraction.\n\n**21st century**\n\n### 2000s\n\nThe 21st century saw significant changes in Sydney, with the city becoming a major hub for international business, finance, and trade. The city's economy continued to diversify, with the establishment of new industries, including renewable energy, biotechnology, and creative industries. In 2001, the city celebrated its 200th anniversary, with a range of events and festivities.\n\n### 2010s\n\nDuring the 2010s, Sydney underwent significant transformation, with the city becoming a major hub for innovation, entrepreneurship, and creativity. The city's startup scene grew rapidly, with the establishment of new businesses, incubators, and accelerators. In 2012, the city's iconic Harbour Bridge was upgraded, with the installation of new walkways and viewing platforms.\n\n### 2020s\n\nThe 2020s have seen significant challenges for Sydney, including the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing impact of climate change. However, the city has continued to evolve and adapt, with the establishment of new initiatives and programs aimed at addressing these challenges. In 2020, the city celebrated its 230th anniversary, with a range of events and festivities.\n\n**See also**\n\n* History of Sydney\n* List of Sydney's oldest buildings\n* List of notable Sydneysiders\n* Sydney's cultural institutions\n\n**References**\n\n* \n\n**Bibliography**\n\n* \n\n**External links**\n\n* City of Sydney website\n* Sydney Opera House website\n* Sydney Harbour Bridge website", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The Creoles of Saint-Domingue were a product of the transatlantic slave trade and the colonial system of the French West Indies. They were a blend of French, African, and indigenous Taino influences, shaped by the island's history of slavery, colonization, and revolution. This article will explore the history and culture of the Saint-Domingue Creoles, from their origins to their role in the Haitian Revolution and their legacy in the modern era.\n\n**#Saint-Domingue Creole Society**\n\n### **Etymology**\n\nThe term \"Creole\" was first used in the 17th century to describe the mixed-race people of the Caribbean. In the context of Saint-Domingue, the term referred to people of European, African, and indigenous ancestry, who were born and raised on the island. The Creoles of Saint-Domingue were a distinct group, separate from both the enslaved Africans and the European colonizers.\n\n### **Origin of the Saint-Domingue Creoles**\n\nThe origins of the Saint-Domingue Creoles are complex and multifaceted. Many were the offspring of European colonizers and enslaved African women. Others were born to mixed-race parents, who were themselves the product of previous unions between Europeans and Africans. The Creoles of Saint-Domingue were also influenced by the indigenous Taino people, who had inhabited the island for centuries before the arrival of the Europeans.\n\n### **Saint-Domingue Creole society**\n\nSaint-Domingue Creole society was characterized by a complex hierarchy, with the Creoles occupying a middle position between the European colonizers and the enslaved Africans. The Creoles were free people, but they were subject to many of the same laws and regulations as the enslaved. They were required to pay taxes, serve in the military, and follow the same rules of conduct as the Europeans.\n\n### **Development of Creole culture**\n\nCreole culture in Saint-Domingue was shaped by the island's unique history and geography. The Creoles developed a distinct language, known as Creole French, which was a blend of French, African, and indigenous influences. They also developed a unique cuisine, which was shaped by the island's tropical climate and the availability of local ingredients.\n\n### **Freedoms of the Creoles and Affranchis**\n\nThe Creoles and Affranchis (freed slaves) of Saint-Domingue enjoyed certain freedoms that were not available to the enslaved Africans. They were free to move about the island, to own property, and to engage in trade and commerce. However, they were still subject to many of the same laws and regulations as the Europeans, and they were often treated as second-class citizens.\n\n### **Slavery in Saint-Domingue**\n\nSlavery was a central institution in Saint-Domingue, and it played a major role in shaping the island's history and culture. The enslaved Africans were brought to the island in large numbers, and they were forced to work on plantations, in mines, and in other industries. The enslaved were subject to brutal treatment, and they were denied basic human rights.\n\n### **African presence in Saint-Domingue**\n\nThe African presence in Saint-Domingue was profound, and it played a major role in shaping the island's culture and history. The enslaved Africans brought with them their languages, customs, and traditions, which were incorporated into Creole culture. The African influence can be seen in the island's cuisine, music, and art.\n\n### **European presence in Saint-Domingue**\n\nThe European presence in Saint-Domingue was also significant, and it played a major role in shaping the island's history and culture. The Europeans brought with them their languages, customs, and traditions, which were incorporated into Creole culture. The European influence can be seen in the island's architecture, cuisine, and art.\n\n### **Royalist curtailment of Creole rights**\n\nIn the late 18th century, the French monarchy began to curtail the rights of the Creoles and Affranchis. The Creoles were required to pay higher taxes, and they were denied the right to own property. The Affranchis were also subject to stricter regulations, and they were denied the right to engage in trade and commerce.\n\n### **Downturn of Saint-Domingue's economy**\n\nIn the late 18th century, the economy of Saint-Domingue began to downturn. The island's sugar and coffee industries declined, and the colonizers were forced to rely on imported goods. The downturn of the economy had a major impact on the Creoles and Affranchis, who were heavily dependent on trade and commerce.\n\n### **Saint-Domingue Creoles in the American Revolutionary War**\n\nThe Saint-Domingue Creoles played a significant role in the American Revolutionary War. Many Creoles fought alongside the Americans, and they helped to defeat the British. The Creoles also played a major role in the Haitian Revolution, which began in 1791.\n\n**#Revolutionary History of Saint-Domingue**\n\n### **The Rebellion of Saint-Domingue**\n\nThe Haitian Revolution began in 1791, when a slave rebellion broke out on the northern coast of the island. The rebellion was led by Boukman, a Vodou priest, and it was the largest and most successful slave rebellion in modern history. The rebellion spread throughout the island, and it eventually led to the establishment of the first independent black nation in the world.\n\n### **Civil War and Invasion of Santo Domingo**\n\nIn 1801, Haiti invaded Santo Domingo, which is now known as the Dominican Republic. The invasion was led by Toussaint Louverture, a former slave who had become a military leader. The invasion was successful, and Haiti b", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The square is named after the first word, \"Sator,\" which is Latin for \"sower.\" This enigmatic square has captivated scholars and enthusiasts alike for centuries, with its meaning and origins remaining a topic of debate.\n\n**Description and naming**\n\nThe Sator Square consists of five rows of five letters each, forming a 5x5 grid:\n\nS A T O R\nA R E P O\nT E N E T\nO P E R A\nR O T A S\n\nThe square is typically read from top to bottom, left to right, and right to left, revealing a Latin palindrome. The arrangement of letters is often attributed to the architect Apollodorus of Damascus.\n\n**Discovery and dating**\n\nThe Sator Square is believed to have originated in ancient Rome, with some estimates dating it back to the 1st century AD. The earliest known examples of the square were found in the ruins of the Roman city of Meroe, in what is now modern-day Sudan. The square was likely used for a variety of purposes, including as a magical or medicinal aid.\n\n**Translation**\n\n**Individual words**\n\nEach row of the Sator Square contains a unique set of words:\n\n* S A T O R: Sower, farmer\n* A R E P O: Arepo, a Latin name for a grain\n* T E N E T: Tene, a Latin word for \"darkness\" or \"shadows\"\n* O P E R A: Opera, a Latin word for \"work\" or \"labor\"\n* R O T A S: Rotas, a Latin word for \"wheel\" or \"circle\"\n\n**Sentence construction**\n\nSome scholars believe that the Sator Square forms a sentence when read from left to right and right to left. The sentence is often translated as: \"Sator Arepo Tenet Opera Rotas,\" which can be interpreted as \"The sower Arepo holds the work of the wheel.\"\n\n**Arepo interpretations**\n\nThe name \"Arepo\" is often associated with the Latin word for \"arepa,\" a type of grain or cereal. Some scholars believe that the square was used to promote the sale of a specific type of grain or to advertise the construction of a new grain mill.\n\n**Further anagrams**\n\nIn addition to the Sator Square, there are several other anagrams that can be formed using the letters of the square. These anagrams often form words or phrases related to agriculture, craftsmanship, or spiritual practices.\n\n**Origin and meaning**\n\n**Christian symbol**\n\nThe Sator Square has been interpreted as a Christian symbol, with the word \"Sator\" representing Jesus Christ as the sower of seeds. The square is often associated with the phrase \"Iesus Christus, Sator Mundi,\" meaning \"Jesus Christ, Sower of the World.\"\n\n**Adoption by Christians**\n\nThe Sator Square was adopted by early Christians as a symbol of their faith, with many examples found in ancient Christian art and architecture. The square was often used to depict the resurrection of Jesus Christ, with the letters representing the cycle of life, death, and rebirth.\n\n**Paternoster theory**\n\nSome scholars believe that the Sator Square is an anagram of the Paternoster, a Latin prayer that begins with the phrase \"Pater Noster, qui es in caelis.\" The theory suggests that the square was used to promote the adoption of Christianity in ancient Rome.\n\n**Roman word puzzle**\n\nThe Sator Square has also been interpreted as a Roman word puzzle, with the letters forming a series of Latin words and phrases related to agriculture and craftsmanship. The square was likely used to challenge and entertain Roman scholars and nobles.\n\n**Jewish symbol**\n\nSome scholars believe that the Sator Square has Jewish roots, with the letters forming a series of Hebrew words and phrases related to the Torah. The square was likely used to promote the study and interpretation of the Torah in ancient Jewish communities.\n\n**Other theories**\n\nIn addition to the Christian and Jewish interpretations, the Sator Square has been associated with a variety of other symbols and meanings, including:\n\n* The cycle of life and death\n* The cycle of the seasons\n* The construction of a new city or town\n* The promotion of a specific trade or profession\n* The celebration of a specific holiday or festival\n\n**Magical and medical associations**\n\nThe Sator Square has been associated with a variety of magical and medical practices, including:\n\n* Divination and fortune-telling\n* Healing and medicine\n* Protection and defense\n* Fertility and agriculture\n\n**Notable examples**\n\n**Roman**\n\nThe Sator Square is found in a variety of Roman ruins and artifacts, including:\n\n* The ruins of the Roman city of Meroe, in modern-day Sudan\n* The ruins of the Roman city of Ostia, near Rome\n* The Roman catacombs, in Rome\n* The Roman mosaics, in various locations throughout the Roman Empire\n\n**Early medieval**\n\nThe Sator Square is found in a variety of early medieval artifacts and texts, including:\n\n* The Lindisfarne Gospels, an illuminated manuscript from the 8th century\n* The Book of Kells, an illuminated manuscript from the 9th century\n* The Codex Aureus, a gold-illuminated manuscript from the 10th century\n\n**Later medieval**\n\nThe Sator Square is found in a variety of later medieval artifacts and texts, including:\n\n* The Psalter of St. Louis, an illuminated manuscript from the 13th century\n* The Book of Hours, an illuminated manuscript from the 14th century\n* The Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry, an illuminated manuscript from the 15th century\n\n**Other**\n\nThe Sator Square is found in a variety of other contexts, including:\n\n* Ancient Greek and Roman coins\n* Medieval illuminated manuscripts\n* Modern art and literature\n\n**In popular culture**\n\nThe Sator Square has been referenced and parodied in a variety of popular culture contexts, including:\n\n* Literature: The square is referenced in the works of authors such as Jorge Luis Borges and Umberto Eco.\n* Film: The square is referenced in films such as \"The Seventh Seal\" and \"The Name of the Rose.\"\n* Music: The square is referenced in songs such as \"The Sator Square\" by KMFDM.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Latin alphabet\n* Palindrome\n* Anagram\n* Divination\n* Fortune-telling\n* Healing and medicine\n* Protection and defense\n* Fertility and agriculture\n* Christian symbols\n* Jewish symbols\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The Sator Square is a complex and multifaceted symbol with a rich history and meaning.\n* The square has been interpreted in a variety of ways, including as a Christian symbol, a Jewish symbol, a Roman word puzzle, and a magical or medicinal aid.\n* The square has been found in a variety of contexts, including ancient Roman ruins, medieval illuminated manuscripts, and modern art and literature.\n\n**References**\n\n* This article does not include any references as it is a general information article.\n\n**Further reading**\n\n* For a more in-depth look at the Sator Square, see the book \"The Sator Square: A Study of the Ancient Latin Palindrome\" by [Author].\n* For a more general overview of the Sator Square, see the article \"The Sator Square\" in the Encyclopedia Britannica.\n\n**External links**\n\n* The Sator Square: A Study of the Ancient Latin Palindrome\n* The Encyclopedia Britannica article on the Sator Square\n* The Sator Square on Wikipedia\n* The Sator Square on Google Arts & Culture", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The clashes marked a significant escalation in the long-standing conflict over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Nagorno-Karabakh conflict has its roots in the early 20th century, when the region was part of the Russian Empire. After the Russian Revolution, the region was annexed by the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic, leading to tensions between the two groups. In the early 1990s, a full-scale war broke out, resulting in the deaths of thousands of people and the displacement of hundreds of thousands. A ceasefire was negotiated in 1994, but the conflict has continued to simmer ever since.\n\nIn recent years, tensions have increased, with periodic outbreaks of violence and clashes along the line of contact. The situation has been exacerbated by the involvement of outside powers, including Russia and Turkey, which have provided military and economic assistance to Azerbaijan.\n\n**Timeline**\n\n### 12–13 September\n\nThe clashes began on September 12, when Armenian forces reported that Azerbaijani troops had crossed the line of contact and entered Armenian-controlled territory. The Armenian military responded with artillery fire, and the situation rapidly escalated into a full-scale conflict.\n\n### 14–16 September\n\nOver the next few days, the fighting continued to intensify, with both sides reporting significant losses. The Armenian military claimed to have repelled several Azerbaijani attacks, while Azerbaijan reported that its forces had made significant gains.\n\n### 21–29 September\n\nThe clashes continued throughout the month, with both sides reporting periodic outbreaks of violence. The situation remained tense, with both sides accusing each other of violating the ceasefire.\n\n**Shelling of Russian military**\n\nOn September 20, the Armenian military reported that Azerbaijani forces had shelled a Russian military base in the Nagorno-Karabakh region. The incident sparked widespread condemnation, with both Russia and Armenia accusing Azerbaijan of violating international law.\n\n**Suspected war crimes and crimes against humanity**\n\nThe clashes have raised concerns about the possibility of war crimes and crimes against humanity being committed on both sides. Human rights groups have reported that civilians have been caught in the crossfire, and that both sides have engaged in practices that may constitute war crimes.\n\n**Infrastructure damage**\n\nThe clashes have caused significant damage to infrastructure in the Nagorno-Karabakh region. Roads, bridges, and other critical infrastructure have been damaged or destroyed, making it difficult for civilians to access basic necessities like food and medical care.\n\n**Effects**\n\n### Cancelled events\n\nThe clashes have had a significant impact on the region's economy and social life. Several events, including cultural festivals and sports tournaments, have been cancelled due to the ongoing conflict.\n\n### Protests in Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh\n\nProtests have been held in Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh, with demonstrators calling for an end to the conflict and an immediate withdrawal of Azerbaijani forces.\n\n### Anti-war opposition in Azerbaijan\n\nThere have been reports of anti-war protests in Azerbaijan, with some citizens calling for an end to the conflict and a return to diplomacy.\n\n### Sports\n\nThe clashes have also had an impact on the sports world. Several international sports organizations, including the International Olympic Committee, have called for a boycott of Azerbaijan until the conflict is resolved.\n\n**Analysis**\n\nThe September 2022 Armenia–Azerbaijan clashes are a complex and multifaceted conflict, with deep historical and cultural roots. The situation is further complicated by the involvement of outside powers, including Russia and Turkey, which have provided military and economic assistance to Azerbaijan.\n\n**Reactions**\n\n### Countries\n\nThe conflict has sparked widespread condemnation from around the world. The United States, Russia, and the European Union have all issued statements calling for an end to the violence and a return to diplomacy.\n\n### Organizations\n\nThe United Nations has also weighed in, calling for an immediate ceasefire and a return to negotiations. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) has also expressed concern about the situation and has offered to mediate a resolution to the conflict.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Nagorno-Karabakh conflict\n* Armenia–Azerbaijan relations\n* Azerbaijan–Turkey relations\n* Russia–Armenia relations\n* International Olympic Committee", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

It was released on August 21, 2020, through Epic Records and Cactus Jack Records. The album marks a significant departure from Scott's previous work, showcasing a more experimental and introspective approach to his music.\n\n**Background and recording**\n\nUtopia was recorded during the COVID-19 pandemic, with Scott working remotely from his home studio in Texas. The album's production was handled primarily by Scott himself, with additional contributions from several notable producers, including Mike Dean, Frank Dukes, and WondaGurl. Scott has stated that the album was inspired by his experiences during the pandemic, as well as his own personal struggles with anxiety and depression.\n\nIn an interview with Rolling Stone, Scott described Utopia as a \"very introspective\" album, one that explores themes of isolation, loneliness, and the search for connection in a post-pandemic world. The album's title, Utopia, refers to a hypothetical society that is ideal and perfect, but also acknowledges the imperfections and contradictions of real life.\n\n**Release and promotion**\n\nUtopia was announced on August 12, 2020, with the release of a promotional single, \"Franchise\" (feat. Young Thug and M.I.A.).

Born on July 22, 1970, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Milei is known for his libertarian economic views and his outspoken criticism of Argentina's socialist and populist governments.\n\n**Early life and education**\n\nMilei was born to Italian immigrant parents in a traditional Italian-Argentine neighborhood in Buenos Aires. His parents were both entrepreneurs who owned a small business. Milei's early life was marked by a strong interest in economics and politics, which was influenced by his parents' entrepreneurial spirit and his own reading of classical liberal authors such as Adam Smith and Friedrich Hayek.\n\nMilei studied economics at the Universidad de Buenos Aires, where he earned a degree in economics. He later earned a Ph.D. in economics from the Universidad de San Andrés. During his academic career, Milei was influenced by the works of Austrian School economists such as Murray Rothbard and Friedrich Hayek.\n\n**Economics career**\n\nAfter completing his education, Milei began his career as an economist, working as a consultant for various private companies and think tanks. He also worked as a radio host and television commentator, where he gained a large following for his outspoken views on economics and politics.\n\nMilei's economic views are rooted in classical liberalism and Austrian School economics. He advocates for limited government intervention in the economy, free markets, and individual liberty. He has been critical of Argentina's socialist and populist governments, which he believes have led to economic stagnation and corruption.\n\n**Early political career**\n\nMilei's entry into politics began in the 2010s, when he became a prominent figure in the libertarian movement in Argentina. He ran for office several times, but failed to win any significant positions. However, his popularity as a media personality and economist continued to grow, and he became a leading voice in Argentine politics.\n\n**Rise to prominence**\n\nMilei's rise to prominence began in 2020, when he gained a large following on social media for his outspoken views on politics and economics.

The art of pottery has a rich history, with evidence of its existence dating back to ancient civilizations. Today, pottery is a popular craft practiced by individuals and communities around the world, with a wide range of techniques and styles.\n\n**Main types**\n\n### Earthenware\n\nEarthenware pottery is made from a type of clay that is high in iron and water content. This makes it more prone to cracking and breaking than other types of clay, but also gives it a characteristic brown or red color. Earthenware is often used to create functional items such as plates, bowls, and cups, as well as decorative pieces like vases and figurines.\n\nEarthenware can be fired at a relatively low temperature, typically between 1800°F and 2000°F (980°C and 1090°C). This makes it a popular choice for beginners and hobbyists, as it is relatively easy to work with and requires minimal equipment.\n\n### Stoneware\n\nStoneware pottery is made from a type of clay that is higher in silica and lower in iron and water content than earthenware. This makes it stronger and more resistant to cracking and breaking than earthenware. Stoneware is often used to create functional items such as plates, bowls, and cups, as well as decorative pieces like vases and sculptures.\n\nStoneware can be fired at a higher temperature than earthenware, typically between 2000°F and 2400°F (1090°C and 1315°C). This makes it a popular choice for artists and crafters who want to create durable and long-lasting pieces.\n\n### Porcelain\n\nPorcelain pottery is made from a type of clay that is high in kaolin and feldspar. This makes it extremely hard and translucent, with a characteristic white or pale blue color. Porcelain is often used to create decorative pieces like figurines, vases, and plates, as well as functional items like tea sets and dinnerware.\n\nPorcelain can be fired at an extremely high temperature, typically between 2400°F and 2600°F (1315°C and 1427°C). This makes it a popular choice for artists and crafters who want to create delicate and intricate pieces.\n\n**Archaeology**\n\n### Fabric analysis\n\nIn archaeology, pottery is often used as a tool for dating and understanding past cultures. By analyzing the composition and techniques used to create a piece of pottery, archaeologists can gain insights into the technological and artistic abilities of ancient civilizations. Additionally, the study of pottery can provide clues about the trade and exchange networks of ancient societies.\n\nFabric analysis, also known as ceramic analysis, involves examining the physical and chemical properties of a piece of pottery to determine its composition and origin. This can include analyzing the type of clay used, the firing temperature and atmosphere, and the presence of any additives or glazes.\n\n**Clay bodies and raw materials**\n\nClay is the primary material used in pottery, and it can be found in various forms and compositions. There are several types of clay bodies, including:\n\n* **Earthenware clay**: A type of clay that is high in iron and water content, often used to create functional items like plates and bowls.\n* **Stoneware clay**: A type of clay that is higher in silica and lower in iron and water content than earthenware, often used to create functional items like plates and bowls.\n* **Porcelain clay**: A type of clay that is high in kaolin and feldspar, often used to create decorative pieces like figurines and vases.\n\nRaw materials used in pottery can also include:\n\n* **Feldspar**: A type of mineral that is often used as a flux to lower the melting point of clay.\n* **Kaolin**: A type of mineral that is often used to create a white or pale blue color in porcelain.\n* **Silica**: A type of mineral that is often used to create a strong and durable glaze.\n\n**Production**\n\n### Shaping\n\nThe first step in creating a piece of pottery is shaping the clay into the desired form. This can be done using a variety of techniques, including:\n\n* **Hand-building**: Shaping the clay by hand using techniques like coiling, pinching, and sculpting.\n* **Throwing**: Using a potter's wheel to shape the clay into a symmetrical form.\n* **Slab construction**: Cutting and shaping flat sheets of clay to create a piece of pottery.\n\n### Drying\n\nOnce the clay has been shaped, it must be dried to remove excess moisture. This can be done using:\n\n* **Air drying**: Allowing the clay to dry slowly in the air.\n* **Oven drying**: Placing the clay in a low-temperature oven to speed up the drying process.\n* **Dehumidifying**: Using a dehumidifier to remove excess moisture from the air.\n\n### Firing\n\nThe final step in creating a piece of pottery is firing it in a kiln to high temperatures. This can be done using:\n\n* **Electric kiln**: A kiln that uses electricity to heat the clay to high temperatures.\n* **Gas kiln**: A kiln that uses gas to heat the clay to high temperatures.\n* **Wood-fired kiln**: A kiln that uses wood to heat the clay to high temperatures.\n\n### Temperature\n\nThe temperature at which a piece of pottery is fired can vary depending on the type of clay and the desired outcome. Here are some common firing temperatures:\n\n* **Earthenware**: 1800°F to 2000°F (980°C to 1090°C)\n* **Stoneware**: 2000°F to 2400°F (1090°C to 1315°C)\n* **Porcelain**: 2400°F to 2600°F (1315°C to 1427°C)\n\n### Atmosphere\n\nThe atmosphere in which a piece of pottery is fired can also affect the outcome. Here are some common firing atmospheres:\n\n* **Reducing atmosphere**: An atmosphere that removes oxygen, often used to create a glossy or metallic glaze.\n* **Oxidizing atmosphere**: An atmosphere that provides oxygen, often used to create a clear or transparent glaze.\n* **Neutral atmosphere**: An atmosphere that provides neither reducing nor oxidizing conditions, often used to create a matte or textured glaze.\n\n### Methods\n\nThere are several methods of firing pottery, including:\n\n* **Bisque firing**: Firing the clay to a low temperature to remove excess moisture and create a hard surface.\n* **Glaze firing**: Firing the clay with a glaze to create a colorful or glossy surface.\n* **Salt firing**: Firing the clay with salt to create a unique and unpredictable effect.\n\n### Stages\n\nThe firing process can be divided into several stages, including:\n\n* **Bisque firing**: The first stage of firing, in which the clay is fired to a low temperature.\n* **Glaze firing**: The second stage of firing, in which the clay is fired with a glaze.\n* **Final firing**: The final stage of firing, in which the clay is fired to a high temperature to achieve the desired effect.\n\n**Decorating**\n\n### Methods\n\nThere are several methods of decorating pottery, including:\n\n* **Painting**: Using a brush to apply paint or glaze to the surface of the pottery.\n* **Slip trailing**: Using a tool to apply a thin layer of liquid clay to the surface of the pottery.\n* **Sgraffito**: Using a tool to scratch a design into the surface of the pottery.\n* **Underglaze**: Using a pigment to create a design that appears underneath the glaze.\n\n**Glazing**\n\nGlazing is the process of applying a layer of glaze to the surface of the pottery to create a colorful or glossy effect. There are several types of glazes, including:\n\n* **Clear glaze**: A transparent glaze that allows the color of the clay to show through.\n* **Colored glaze**: A glaze that contains pigment to create a specific color.\n* **Metallic glaze**: A glaze that contains metal oxides to create a metallic effect.\n* **Glossy glaze**: A glaze that is applied to create a glossy or shiny effect.\n\n**Health and environmental issues**\n\nThe production of pottery can have several health and environmental impacts, including:\n\n* **Ceramic dust**: The inhalation of ceramic dust can cause respiratory problems.\n* **Lead exposure**: The use of lead-based glazes can expose workers to lead.\n* **Water pollution**: The use of water in the pottery-making process can pollute nearby water sources.\n* **Waste management**: The disposal of pottery waste can contribute to landfill waste and pollution.\n\n**History**\n\n### Early pottery\n\nThe earliest evidence of pottery dates back to around 18,000 BCE, during the Stone Age. Early pottery was likely created by accident, as a result of cooking in a fired clay vessel.\n\n### History by region\n\n#### Beginnings of pottery\n\nThe beginnings of pottery are not well-documented, but it is believed to have originated in multiple regions around the world.\n\n#### East Asia\n\nThe earliest evidence of pottery in East Asia dates back to around 18,000 BCE, during the Paleolithic era.\n\n#### South Asia\n\nThe earliest evidence of pottery in South Asia dates back to around 9,000 BCE, during the Neolithic era.\n\n#### Southeast Asia\n\nThe earliest evidence of pottery in Southeast Asia dates back to around 6,000 BCE, during the Neolithic era.\n\n#### West Asia\n\nThe earliest evidence of pottery in West Asia dates back to around 10,000 BCE, during the Neolithic era.\n\n#### Europe\n\nThe earliest evidence of pottery in Europe dates back to around 5,000 BCE, during the Neolithic era.\n\n#### United Kingdom\n\nThe earliest evidence of pottery in the United Kingdom dates back to around 4,000 BCE, during the Neolithic era.\n\n#### Arabic pottery\n\nArabic pottery originated in the 8th century CE, during the Islamic Golden Age.\n\n#### Americas\n\nThe earliest evidence of pottery in the Americas dates back to around 2,500 BCE, during the Archaic era.\n\n#### Africa\n\nThe earliest evidence of pottery in Africa dates back to around 9,000 BCE, during the Neolithic era.\n\n#### Oceania\n\nThe earliest evidence of pottery in Oceania dates back to around 2,000 BCE, during the Lapita culture.\n\n**See also**\n\n* **Ceramics**\n* **Glaze**\n* **Potter's wheel**\n* **Kiln**\n* **Firing**\n* **Bisque**\n* **Slip**\n* **Underglaze**\n* **Sgraffito**\n\n**References**\n\n* **American Ceramic Society**\n* **National Council on the Arts**\n* **College Art Association**\n* **Museum of Modern Art**\n* **Smithsonian Institution**\n\n**Further reading**\n\n* **The Potter's Bible**\n* **The Art of Pottery**\n* **The History of Pottery**\n* **The Techniques of Pottery**\n* **The Materials of Pottery**\n\n**External links**\n\n* **American Ceramic Society**\n* **National Council on the Arts**\n* **College Art Association**\n* **Museum of Modern Art**\n* **Smithsonian Institution**", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.
