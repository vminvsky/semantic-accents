He was a member of the Italian Communist Party and later became the leader of the Democratic Left.\n\nEarly life\n\nGiorgio Napolitano was born on June 29, 1925, in Napoli, Italy. His father, Giuseppe Napolitano, was a pharmacist, and his mother, Gertrude Rizzo, was a primary school teacher. Napolitano was the second of four children. His family was of moderate means, and he was raised in a secular household.\n\nNapolitano attended the Liceo Classico Umberto I in Napoli, where he showed a keen interest in literature and philosophy. After completing his secondary education, he enrolled in the University of Napoli, where he studied law. However, he was expelled from the university in 1944 due to his involvement in anti-fascist activities.\n\nEarly political career\n\nWorld War II and anti-fascist resistance\n\nNapolitano became involved in the Italian resistance movement during World War II. He joined the Italian Communist Party (PCI) in 1943 and participated in several underground operations against the fascist regime. After the war, he was appointed as the secretary of the PCI's youth wing, the Italian Socialist Youth Federation.\n\nFrom post-war years to the Hungarian Revolution of 1956\n\nIn the aftermath of the war, Napolitano became a key figure in the PCI's youth movement. He traveled extensively throughout Italy, promoting the party's ideology and organizing events for young people. In 1955, he was appointed as the national secretary of the PCI's youth wing. Following the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, Napolitano was one of the few PCI leaders who openly supported the Soviet Union's intervention in Hungary.\n\nLeading member of the Italian Communist Party\n\nFrom the 1960s to 1980s\n\nNapolitano became a prominent figure in the PCI in the 1960s. He was elected to the party's central committee in 1964 and became a member of the party's national executive committee in 1969. In 1975, he was appointed as the secretary of the PCI's national executive committee. Napolitano played a key role in promoting the PCI's electoral strategy and was a close ally of PCI leader Enrico Berlinguer.\n\nAfter the Italian Communist Party\n\nPresident of the Chamber of Deputies\n\nIn 1976, Napolitano was elected as the President of the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of the Italian Parliament. He served in this position until 1979 and was succeeded by Pietro Ingrao. As President of the Chamber of Deputies, Napolitano was responsible for overseeing the parliamentary proceedings and ensuring that the House operated smoothly.\n\nLate 1990s and early 2000s\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, Napolitano became a key figure in the Democratic Left, a new party that emerged from the remnants of the PCI. He was appointed as the leader of the party's national executive committee and played a key role in shaping the party's electoral strategy.\n\nPresident of Italy\n\nFirst term (2006–2013)\n\nElection\n\nIn 2006, Napolitano was elected as the President of Italy, with 543 votes out of 1,007. He was the first communist to hold the position and was seen as a compromise candidate between the two main parties, the Democratic Party and the People of Freedom.\n\nProdi Cabinet\n\nNapolitano's presidency began with the formation of the Prodi Cabinet, led by Romano Prodi. The cabinet was a coalition of the Democratic Party, the People of Freedom, and other smaller parties. Napolitano played a key role in shaping the cabinet's policies and ensuring its stability.\n\n2008 political crisis\n\nIn 2008, Italy was hit by a major financial crisis, and the Prodi Cabinet was forced to resign. Napolitano played a key role in mediating the crisis and ensuring that the country's institutions functioned smoothly.\n\nEluana Englaro incident\n\nIn 2009, Napolitano became embroiled in a controversy surrounding the Eluana Englaro case. Englaro, a 37-year-old woman, had been in a coma for over 20 years and was being kept alive by life-support machines. Her parents had requested that the machines be switched off, but the Catholic Church had objected, citing its opposition to euthanasia.\n\nNapolitano played a key role in resolving the crisis, meeting with Englaro's parents and the Church's representatives to find a solution. Ultimately, the machines were switched off, and Englaro died.\n\n2011 political crisis\n\nIn 2011, Italy was hit by another major financial crisis, and the Berlusconi Cabinet was forced to resign. Napolitano played a key role in mediating the crisis and ensuring that the country's institutions functioned smoothly.\n\nSecond term (2013–2015)\n\nRe-election\n\nIn 2013, Napolitano was re-elected as the President of Italy, with 533 votes out of 1,007. He was the first president to be re-elected since the end of the Second World War.\n\nLetta Cabinet\n\nNapolitano's second term began with the formation of the Letta Cabinet, led by Enrico Letta. The cabinet was a coalition of the Democratic Party, the People of Freedom, and other smaller parties. Napolitano played a key role in shaping the cabinet's policies and ensuring its stability.\n\nRenzi Cabinet\n\nIn 2014, Matteo Renzi became the Prime Minister of Italy, and Napolitano's role became increasingly symbolic. He continued to play a key role in mediating crises and ensuring the stability of the country's institutions.\n\nResignation\n\nIn 2015, Napolitano resigned as the President of Italy, citing his advanced age and the need for a new president to take over. He was succeeded by Sergio Mattarella.\n\nLater life\n\nAfter his resignation, Napolitano returned to private life, but continued to be involved in politics. He remained a prominent figure in the Democratic Party and continued to shape the party's policies.\n\nPersonal life\n\nRelations with the Catholic Church\n\nNapolitano's relationship with the Catholic Church was complex and often contentious. As a communist, he was seen as a threat by the Church, and he was frequently criticized for his views on euthanasia and other issues. However, he also had a deep respect for the Church and its traditions, and he often sought to find common ground with its leaders.\n\nDeath and state funeral\n\nNapolitano died on January 13, 2023, at the age of 97. He was given a state funeral, attended by the President of Italy, the Prime Minister, and other senior officials. The funeral was a tribute to his long and distinguished career, and his contributions to Italian politics.\n\nLegacy\n\nNapolitano's legacy is complex and multifaceted. As a communist, he played a key role in shaping the Italian left and promoting the values of socialism and democracy. As President of Italy, he ensured the stability of the country's institutions and played a key role in mediating crises. He was a fierce defender of the rule of law and a champion of human rights.\n\nElectoral history\n\nFirst-past-the-post elections\n\nNapolitano was elected to the Italian Parliament in 1976, 1987, and 1992. He was a member of the PCI and later the Democratic Left.\n\nPresidential elections\n\nNapolitano was elected as the President of Italy in 2006 and 2013. He was the first communist to hold the position and was seen as a compromise candidate between the two main parties.\n\nHonours\n\nNational honours\n\nNapolitano was awarded the title of Cavaliere di Gran Croce dell'Ordine al Merito della Repubblica Italiana in 1976. He was also awarded the title of Grand'Ufficiale dell'Ordine al Merito della Repubblica Italiana in 1987.\n\nForeign honours\n\nNapolitano was awarded the Order of the White Eagle by the President of Poland in 1996. He was also awarded the Grand Cross of the Order of the Aztec Eagle by the President of Mexico in 2001.\n\nSee also\n\n* List of Presidents of Italy\n* Italian Communist Party\n* Democratic Left\n* Enrico Berlinguer\n* Romano Prodi\n* Matteo Renzi\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\n* Napolitano, G.

It is composed of various courts and tribunals that hear cases and make decisions on matters related to civil, criminal, and administrative law. The judiciary plays a crucial role in ensuring that the rights of citizens are protected and that the rule of law is upheld in Poland.\n\n**Structure**\n\nThe Polish judiciary is structured into several levels of courts and tribunals, each with its own jurisdiction and areas of expertise.\n\n### Common courts\n\nThe common courts in Poland are divided into two main types: district courts (Sądy Okręgowe) and regional courts (Sądy Apelacyjne). District courts are the first instance courts, and they hear cases related to civil and criminal law. Regional courts are higher courts that hear appeals from district courts. The supreme court (Sąd Najwyższy) is the highest court in Poland, and it hears cases related to the interpretation of the law and the constitution.\n\n#### District courts\n\nDistrict courts are the first instance courts in Poland, and they have jurisdiction over a specific geographic area. They are responsible for hearing cases related to civil and criminal law, including family law, labor law, and administrative law. District courts are divided into two types: general jurisdiction courts and specialized courts. General jurisdiction courts have jurisdiction over a wide range of cases, while specialized courts have jurisdiction over specific areas of law.\n\n#### Regional courts\n\nRegional courts are higher courts that hear appeals from district courts. They are responsible for reviewing decisions made by district courts and making decisions on appeals. Regional courts are also divided into two types: general jurisdiction courts and specialized courts. General jurisdiction courts have jurisdiction over a wide range of cases, while specialized courts have jurisdiction over specific areas of law.\n\n### Military courts\n\nMilitary courts in Poland have jurisdiction over cases related to military law. They are responsible for hearing cases related to military discipline, military crimes, and other matters related to the military.\n\n### Supreme Court\n\nThe supreme court (Sąd Najwyższy) is the highest court in Poland, and it has jurisdiction over the interpretation of the law and the constitution. It is responsible for hearing cases related to the most complex and important matters, including constitutional law, administrative law, and international law.\n\n### Administrative courts\n\nAdministrative courts in Poland have jurisdiction over cases related to administrative law. They are responsible for hearing cases related to government decisions, permits, and licenses.\n\n### Constitutional Tribunal\n\nThe Constitutional Tribunal (Trybunał Konstytucyjny) is a specialized court that has jurisdiction over cases related to the constitution. It is responsible for reviewing the constitutionality of laws and government decisions.\n\n### State Tribunal\n\nThe State Tribunal (Trybunał Stanu) is a specialized court that has jurisdiction over cases related to the impeachment of the President of Poland. It is responsible for hearing cases related to the impeachment of the President and making decisions on whether to remove them from office.\n\n**Procedure**\n\nThe procedure for conducting cases in the Polish judiciary is outlined in the Code of Civil Procedure and the Code of Criminal Procedure. The procedure is designed to ensure that cases are heard in a fair and impartial manner.\n\n### Judges and court assessors\n\nJudges and court assessors play a crucial role in the Polish judiciary. They are responsible for hearing cases, making decisions, and upholding the law.\n\n#### National Council of the Judiciary\n\nThe National Council of the Judiciary (Rada Krajowa Sądownictwa) is a body that is responsible for the appointment and supervision of judges in Poland. It is composed of 25 members, including judges, lawyers, and other experts.\n\n#### Procedure of appointment\n\nThe procedure for appointing judges in Poland involves several steps. First, the National Council of the Judiciary reviews applications from candidates and selects a shortlist of candidates. Next, the President of Poland reviews the shortlist and selects a candidate to appoint as a judge. Finally, the candidate is sworn in as a judge.\n\n#### Rights and duties\n\nJudges in Poland have several rights and duties, including the right to hear cases, make decisions, and uphold the law. They also have the duty to act impartially and in accordance with the law.\n\n### Judges sitting in the tribunals\n\nJudges sitting in the tribunals are responsible for hearing cases and making decisions. They are appointed by the National Council of the Judiciary and are responsible for upholding the law.\n\n### Other judicial positions\n\nOther judicial positions in Poland include court assessors, who assist judges in hearing cases and making decisions. They are also appointed by the National Council of the Judiciary.\n\n### Remuneration\n\nJudges and court assessors in Poland are remunerated for their work. They receive a salary and other benefits, including health insurance and pensions.\n\n**Minimal requirements**\n\nTo become a judge in Poland, candidates must meet several minimal requirements. They must have a law degree, have at least five years of experience as a lawyer, and pass a competitive examination.\n\n**Issues**\n\nThe Polish judiciary has faced several issues in recent years, including concerns about the length of proceedings, lack of popular support and trust, and rule of law concerns.\n\n### Length of proceedings\n\nOne of the major issues facing the Polish judiciary is the length of proceedings. Cases can take years to be heard and decided, which can lead to delays and frustration for litigants.\n\n### Lack of popular support and trust\n\nThe Polish judiciary has also faced concerns about lack of popular support and trust. A survey conducted in 2019 found that only 24% of respondents had confidence in the judiciary.\n\n### Other issues\n\nOther issues facing the Polish judiciary include concerns about the capture of the Constitutional Tribunal, undue influence on judges, and partisan control of the National Council of the Judiciary.\n\n### Rule of law concerns\n\nRule of law concerns have also been raised about the Polish judiciary. The government has been accused of exerting undue influence over the judiciary, including the appointment of judges and the control of the National Council of the Judiciary.\n\n#### Capture of the Constitutional Tribunal\n\nThe capture of the Constitutional Tribunal has been a major concern for the Polish judiciary. In 2016, the government appointed several judges to the tribunal who were seen as loyal to the ruling party. This led to concerns about the independence and impartiality of the tribunal.\n\n#### Undue influence on judges\n\nUndue influence on judges has also been a concern for the Polish judiciary. The government has been accused of exerting pressure on judges to rule in favor of the ruling party.\n\n#### Partisan control of the National Council of the Judiciary\n\nPartisan control of the National Council of the Judiciary has also been a concern for the Polish judiciary. The council has been accused of being controlled by the ruling party, which has led to concerns about the independence and impartiality of the judiciary.\n\n#### Arbitrary secondment of judges\n\nArbitrary secondment of judges has also been a concern for the Polish judiciary. The government has been accused of arbitrarily seconding judges to different courts and tribunals, which has led to concerns about the independence and impartiality of the judiciary.\n\n### Repercussions in Poland and abroad\n\nThe repercussions of these issues have been felt both in Poland and abroad.

The incident heightened tensions between the United States and China, and sparked a renewed debate about the legality of airspace and the downing of unidentified objects.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nReconnaissance balloons have been used by the United States and other countries for decades to gather intelligence and conduct surveillance. The development of advanced materials and technologies has enabled the creation of high-altitude balloons with increased capabilities for data collection and transmission. The 2023 Chinese balloon incident marked a significant escalation of tensions between the United States and China, and highlighted the complexities of global airspace and the rules governing the use of reconnaissance technology.\n\n**Background**\n\n### History and development of reconnaissance balloons\n\nReconnaissance balloons have a long history, dating back to the 20th century. The first reconnaissance balloons were used by the United States during World War I to gather intelligence on enemy positions and movements. The development of high-altitude balloons continued throughout the 20th century, with the United States and the Soviet Union using them to gather intelligence and conduct surveillance.\n\n#### Past Chinese balloons and unidentified objects\n\nChina has also been involved in the use of reconnaissance balloons in the past. In 2009, a Chinese balloon was spotted over the United States, prompting an investigation by the Federal Aviation Administration. In 2019, a Chinese balloon was detected over the Philippines, sparking concerns about China's increasing military presence in the region.\n\n### U.S.–China tensions\n\nThe relationship between the United States and China has been strained in recent years, with tensions escalating over issues such as trade, security, and human rights. The 2023 Chinese balloon incident marked a significant escalation of these tensions, with the United States accusing China of violating its sovereignty and China accusing the United States of overreacting.\n\n**Incident**\n\n### Balloon\n\nThe balloon in question was a high-altitude reconnaissance balloon of Chinese origin. It was approximately 10 meters (33 feet) tall and 6 meters (20 feet) wide, with a payload of approximately 1,000 kilograms (2,200 pounds). The balloon was equipped with signals intelligence capabilities, including sensors and communication equipment, which enabled it to gather and transmit data.\n\n#### Size, propulsion, and payload\n\nThe balloon was powered by a propellant system, which enabled it to fly at altitudes of up to 40,000 meters (131,000 feet). The balloon's payload was designed to gather and transmit signals intelligence, including communications and radar data.\n\n#### Signals intelligence capabilities\n\nThe balloon was equipped with advanced signals intelligence capabilities, including sensors and communication equipment. These capabilities enabled the balloon to gather and transmit data on a wide range of targets, including military and civilian communications.\n\n### Detection\n\nThe balloon was detected by radar systems in the United States on January 28, 2023. The detection was confirmed by multiple sources, including the Federal Aviation Administration and the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD).\n\n### Flight path\n\nThe balloon flew over multiple countries in February 2023, including the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The balloon's flight path took it over a number of major cities, including Washington, D.C., New York City, and Los Angeles.\n\n### U.S. monitoring and counterintelligence\n\nThe United States monitored the balloon's flight path and payload capabilities, and took measures to counter its signals intelligence efforts. The U.S. military launched a counterintelligence operation to disrupt the balloon's communication equipment and prevent it from gathering sensitive information.\n\n### Downing\n\nThe balloon was shot down by a U.S. F-22 fighter jet on February 4, 2023. The downing of the balloon was a significant escalation of tensions between the United States and China, and sparked a renewed debate about the legality of airspace and the downing of unidentified objects.\n\n### Debris recovery\n\nThe debris from the balloon was recovered by the U.S. military, and was transported to a secure facility for analysis. The analysis of the debris confirmed that the balloon was of Chinese origin and had been used for reconnaissance purposes.\n\n**Legality of airspace and downing**\n\nThe legality of airspace and the downing of unidentified objects is a complex issue, with multiple countries having different laws and regulations governing the use of reconnaissance technology. The 2023 Chinese balloon incident highlighted the need for clear and consistent regulations on the use of reconnaissance technology and the downing of unidentified objects.\n\n**Response and reactions**\n\n### United States\n\nThe United States responded to the 2023 Chinese balloon incident with a mix of condemnation and caution. The U.S. government accused China of violating its sovereignty and violating international law, but also expressed concern about the potential for escalation.\n\n### Canada\n\nCanada responded to the incident by expressing concern about the potential risks associated with the balloon's flight path. The Canadian government also called for a thorough investigation into the incident.\n\n### China\n\nChina responded to the incident by accusing the United States of overreacting and violating international law. China also claimed that the balloon was a civilian weather balloon that had been blown off course.\n\n### NATO\n\nNATO responded to the incident by expressing concern about the potential risks associated with the balloon's flight path. The alliance also called for a thorough investigation into the incident.\n\n### Australia\n\nAustralia responded to the incident by expressing concern about the potential risks associated with the balloon's flight path.

The UK government also called for a thorough investigation into the incident.\n\n### Venezuela\n\nVenezuela responded to the incident by expressing solidarity with China and accusing the United States of hypocrisy.\n\n### Media reactions\n\n#### Analysis\n\nThe 2023 Chinese balloon incident sparked a wave of analysis and commentary from media outlets around the world. Many experts and commentators saw the incident as a significant escalation of tensions between the United States and China, and highlighted the need for clear and consistent regulations on the use of reconnaissance technology.\n\n#### Satire\n\nThe 2023 Chinese balloon incident also sparked a wave of satire and humor from media outlets around the world. Many commentators and comedians used the incident as a punchline, poking fun at the absurdity of the situation and the over-the-top reactions from both the United States and China.\n\n**Other high-altitude objects in February 2023**\n\nIn addition to the Chinese balloon, multiple other high-altitude objects were detected in February 2023, including a Russian meteor and a number of unidentified objects. The detection of these objects highlighted the complexity of global airspace and the need for clear and consistent regulations on the use of reconnaissance technology.\n\n**Additional assessments of the balloon**\n\nThe 2023 Chinese balloon incident has been the subject of numerous assessments and analyses, including a report by the U.S. government and a number of independent studies. These assessments have highlighted the significant risks associated with the balloon's flight path and the need for clear and consistent regulations on the use of reconnaissance technology.\n\n**See also**\n\n* List of notable surveillance balloons\n* List of notable unidentified flying objects\n* History of surveillance technology\n* International law on airspace\n* Counterintelligence operations\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is a summary of the 2023 Chinese balloon incident and is intended to provide a neutral and factual overview of the event.\n* The article is based on publicly available information and has not been independently verified.\n* The article is subject to revision and update as new information becomes available.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The team is under the jurisdiction of the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF).\n\n**Introduction**\n\nMorocco has a rich football history, with a strong following and a competitive team that has participated in several international tournaments. The team has a long history, dating back to the early 20th century, and has undergone several periods of success and struggle. Today, the team continues to compete in international competitions, with a growing fan base and a renewed sense of optimism.\n\n**History**\n\n### Pre-independence period\n\nThe early history of football in Morocco dates back to the early 20th century, when the sport was introduced to the country by European colonizers. The first football clubs in Morocco were established in the 1920s, and the country's first national team was formed in 1920. However, the team's early years were marked by a lack of organization and structure, with the team often playing friendly matches against other African and European teams.\n\n### Beginning of Morocco (1955–1963)\n\nAfter Morocco gained independence from France in 1956, the country's football federation was established, and the national team began to take shape. The team made its first appearance in international competition in 1957, participating in the 1957 African Cup of Nations. However, the team was eliminated in the group stage, and it would take several years for the team to experience any significant success.\n\n### First appearances in international competitions (1963–1976)\n\nThe 1960s saw the team's first appearances in international competitions, including the 1962 Africa Cup of Nations and the 1964 Summer Olympics. However, the team struggled to make an impact, and it wasn't until the 1970s that the team began to experience some success.\n\n### Between successes and defeats (1976–1986)\n\nThe 1970s and 1980s saw a mix of successes and defeats for the team. The team won its first Africa Cup of Nations title in 1976, but was eliminated in the group stage in 1978.

These wells pose a significant environmental and economic risk to the province and its residents. As of 2022, it is estimated that there are over 95,000 abandoned wells in Alberta, with many more expected to be added to this list in the coming years.\n\n## Current Overview\n\nThe issue of orphan wells in Alberta is a complex one, involving a combination of factors such as the economic downturn in the oil and gas industry, the high cost of well abandonment, and the lack of effective regulation. As a result, many wells have been left abandoned, posing a significant risk to the environment and public safety.\n\n## Context\n\nThe oil and gas industry has been a significant contributor to Alberta's economy for many decades, with numerous wells drilled and operated throughout the province. However, with the decline in global oil prices, many oil and gas companies have struggled to remain profitable, leading to a significant number of bankruptcies and well abandonments. In addition, the high cost of well abandonment, which can range from $20,000 to over $100,000 per well, has made it difficult for companies to afford to properly plug and abandon their wells.\n\n## Landowners and Municipalities\n\nLandowners and municipalities in Alberta are often left to deal with the consequences of orphan wells on their properties. These wells can pose a significant risk to public safety, as they can leak and produce hazardous gases, including methane and hydrogen sulfide. In addition, the presence of orphan wells can also impact the value of surrounding properties, making it difficult for landowners to sell their land.\n\n## Orphan Well Association\n\nThe Orphan Well Association (OWA) is a non-profit organization that was established in 1979 to address the issue of orphan wells in Alberta. The OWA works with the Alberta government, landowners, and other stakeholders to identify and remediate orphan wells, as well as to provide education and outreach to the public about the risks associated with these wells.\n\n## OWA Funding\n\nThe OWA relies on a combination of funding sources to carry out its work, including federal and provincial subsidies, as well as donations from individuals and organizations.\n\n### Federal and Provincial Subsidies\n\nThe OWA receives funding from the Government of Canada and the Government of Alberta to support its work in identifying and remediating orphan wells. This funding is used to support the OWA's staff, as well as to cover the costs associated with well abandonment and remediation.\n\n## Alberta Energy Regulator\n\nThe Alberta Energy Regulator (AER) is the primary regulator of the oil and gas industry in Alberta. The AER is responsible for ensuring that oil and gas companies comply with regulations related to well abandonment and remediation. However, the AER has come under criticism for its handling of the orphan well issue, with some arguing that it has not done enough to prevent the abandonment of wells or to hold companies accountable for the costs associated with well abandonment.\n\n## Legal and Regulatory Considerations\n\nThe issue of orphan wells in Alberta raises a number of legal and regulatory considerations, including the application of the polluter pays principle and the regulation of suspended inactive wells.\n\n### Polluter Pays Principle\n\nThe polluter pays principle is a key concept in environmental law, which holds that those responsible for environmental harm should be required to pay for the costs associated with remediation. In the context of orphan wells, this principle is particularly relevant, as it suggests that oil and gas companies should be required to pay for the costs associated with well abandonment and remediation.\n\n### Suspended Inactive Wells\n\nSuspended inactive wells are wells that are no longer producing oil or gas, but have not yet been abandoned. These wells can pose a risk to the environment, as they can leak and produce hazardous gases. The AER has implemented regulations to require oil and gas companies to regularly inspect and report on suspended inactive wells, but some argue that these regulations are not sufficient to prevent the abandonment of these wells.\n\n## Bankruptcies and Orphan Wells\n\nBankruptcies in the oil and gas industry have been a significant contributor to the orphan well problem in Alberta. When oil and gas companies go bankrupt, they often leave behind a trail of abandoned wells, which can pose a significant risk to the environment and public safety. In some cases, companies have been accused of strategically packaging their costly liabilities with productive assets, in order to avoid taking responsibility for the costs associated with well abandonment.\n\n## Strategic Packaging of Costly Liabilities with Productive Assets\n\nStrategic packaging of costly liabilities with productive assets is a tactic used by some oil and gas companies to avoid taking responsibility for the costs associated with well abandonment. This involves bundling the costs of well abandonment with the costs of other assets, such as productive wells, in order to create a more attractive package for investors. However, this tactic can leave landowners and municipalities with significant costs associated with well abandonment, which can impact the value of surrounding properties.\n\n## Environmental Impacts of Orphan Wells\n\nOrphan wells can have significant environmental impacts, including fugitive gas emissions, surface casing vent flow (SCVF) and gas migration (GM).\n\n### Fugitive Gas Emissions\n\nFugitive gas emissions are releases of gas from abandoned wells, which can pose a risk to the environment and public safety. These emissions can include methane and hydrogen sulfide, which can be explosive and toxic.\n\n### Surface Casing Vent Flow (SCVF) and Gas Migration (GM)\n\nSurface casing vent flow (SCVF) and gas migration (GM) are two related issues that can occur at abandoned wells. SCVF occurs when gas flows up through the surface casing of a well, while GM occurs when gas migrates through the rock formation surrounding the well. These issues can pose a risk to the environment and public safety, as they can release hazardous gases into the atmosphere.\n\n## Potential Geothermal Conversion of Orphan Wells in Alberta\n\nThere is ongoing research into the potential for geothermal conversion of orphan wells in Alberta. Geothermal energy is a renewable energy source that harnesses the heat from the Earth's core to generate electricity. Abandoned wells could potentially be converted into geothermal wells, providing a new source of renewable energy and reducing the risk associated with orphan wells.\n\n## Responses\n\nThe issue of orphan wells in Alberta has been met with a range of responses, including calls for greater regulation and enforcement, as well as efforts to educate the public about the risks associated with these wells.\n\n## See Also\n\n* Alberta Energy Regulator\n* Orphan Well Association\n* Oil and gas industry in Alberta\n* Environmental law in Alberta\n\n## Notes\n\n* This article is based on publicly available information and is intended to provide a general overview of the issue of orphan wells in Alberta.\n* The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not reflect the views of any organization or individual.\n\n## External Links\n\n* Orphan Well Association\n* Alberta Energy Regulator\n* Government of Alberta: Orphan Wells\n* Oil and Gas Research Institute: Orphan Wells\n\nNote: This article is a general overview of the issue of orphan wells in Alberta and is not intended to be a comprehensive or definitive treatment of the subject.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The valley is situated in the heart of the park, surrounded by rolling hills, rugged mountains, and scenic farmland. This article provides an overview of the valley's history, geology, climate, settlements, tourist attractions, wildlife, and notable individuals associated with the area.\n\n**History**\n\nThe history of Chapel-le-Dale dates back to the Mesolithic era, with archaeological evidence suggesting that humans inhabited the valley as early as 8,000 years ago. The valley's strategic location, with its proximity to the Pennine Way and the River Ribble, made it an important hub for trade and commerce throughout the centuries.\n\n### River names\n\nThe valley is traversed by the River Doe, a tributary of the River Ribble. The river's name is derived from the Old English word \"dō\", meaning \"dark\" or \"black\", likely referring to the river's dark color or the surrounding woodland.\n\n### Etymology\n\nThe name \"Chapel-le-Dale\" is derived from the Old French words \"chapel\" and \"dalle\", meaning \"valley\" or \"dale\". The name likely refers to a chapel or a place of worship that once stood in the valley.\n\n**Geology and geomorphology**\n\nChapel-le-Dale is characterized by its unique geology, with a mix of limestone, sandstone, and shale rocks. The valley's landscape is shaped by the forces of erosion, with the River Doe carving out a path through the rock over millions of years. The valley's terrain is also influenced by the local climate, with the prevailing westerly winds and rainfall contributing to the formation of the landscape.\n\n### Quarrying and mining\n\nThe valley's geology has made it an attractive location for quarrying and mining throughout history. The limestone and sandstone rocks have been quarried for use in construction, while the shale rocks have been mined for use in the production of coal and other industrial materials.\n\n**Climate**\n\nChapel-le-Dale experiences a temperate maritime climate, with mild winters and cool summers. The valley's elevation and proximity to the Pennine Way contribute to its unique climate, with the prevailing westerly winds bringing moisture and cloud cover to the area. The valley's climate is also influenced by its location in the lee of the Pennine Mountains, which protects it from the harsher weather conditions found in other parts of the country.\n\n**Settlements and governance**\n\nChapel-le-Dale is a small, rural valley with a few scattered settlements. The valley is governed by the Yorkshire Dales National Park Authority, which is responsible for protecting the valley's natural beauty and ensuring that any development is carried out in a sustainable and environmentally-friendly manner. The valley is also home to a few small farms and a handful of holiday cottages, which provide accommodation for visitors to the area.\n\n**Tourist attractions**\n\nChapel-le-Dale is a popular destination for tourists, with its scenic beauty and unique geology making it an attractive location for walkers, hikers, and nature lovers. The valley is home to several scenic viewpoints, including the Chapel-le-Dale viewpoint, which offers stunning views of the surrounding countryside. The valley is also home to several ancient monuments, including the remains of a medieval chapel and a Bronze Age burial site.\n\n**Wildlife and designations**\n\nChapel-le-Dale is home to a wide range of wildlife, including birds, mammals, and insects. The valley's unique geology and climate make it an attractive location for a variety of plant and animal species, including the rare and endangered species found in the valley. The valley is designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) due to its unique geology and the importance of its plant and animal species.\n\n**Notable people**\n\nSeveral notable individuals have been associated with Chapel-le-Dale throughout history, including the poet and author James Hogg, who wrote about the valley in his poem \"The Queen's Wake\". The valley has also been visited by several notable figures, including the artist J.M.W. Turner, who painted the valley's scenic beauty in his watercolors.\n\n**Notes**\n\nChapel-le-Dale is a unique and fascinating valley, with its scenic beauty, unique geology, and rich history making it an attractive location for visitors and researchers alike. The valley's natural beauty and wildlife make it an important location for conservation and environmental protection, while its scenic views and historic monuments make it a popular destination for tourists and nature lovers.\n\n**References**\n\nThis article has been written based on a variety of sources, including historical records, scientific research, and literary works.

The crisis began with the collapse of Silvergate Bank, a California-based bank that specialized in serving the cryptocurrency industry. The collapse of Silvergate was followed by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic Bank, which are all major banks in the United States.\n\nBackground\n----------\n\nThe banking system in the United States has undergone significant changes in recent years, with the rise of digital banking and the increasing use of technology in the financial sector. However, the system has also faced challenges, including a decline in interest rates and an increase in regulatory requirements. The crisis of 2023 was triggered by a combination of these factors, which led to a loss of confidence in the banking system.\n\nLiquidation of Silvergate Bank\n-----------------------------\n\n### Background\n\nSilvergate Bank was a California-based bank that specialized in serving the cryptocurrency industry. The bank was founded in 2008 and was headquartered in La Jolla, California. Silvergate was one of the largest banks in the United States that served the cryptocurrency industry, and it had a significant presence in the market.\n\n### Events\n\nOn March 1, 2023, Silvergate Bank announced that it would be closing its doors and would be liquidating its assets. The bank cited a combination of factors, including a decline in deposits and a loss of confidence in the banking system, as the reason for its collapse. The collapse of Silvergate Bank was seen as a significant event in the banking industry, and it raised concerns about the stability of the financial system.\n\nCollapse of Silicon Valley Bank\n-------------------------------\n\n### Background\n\nSilicon Valley Bank was a California-based bank that specialized in serving the technology industry. The bank was founded in 1983 and was headquartered in Santa Clara, California. Silicon Valley Bank was one of the largest banks in the United States that served the technology industry, and it had a significant presence in the market.\n\n### Events\n\nOn March 10, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank announced that it would be collapsing and would be sold to a rival bank. The bank cited a combination of factors, including a decline in deposits and a loss of confidence in the banking system, as the reason for its collapse. The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank was seen as a significant event in the banking industry, and it raised concerns about the stability of the financial system.\n\nCollapse of Signature Bank\n---------------------------\n\n### Background\n\nSignature Bank was a New York-based bank that specialized in serving the cryptocurrency industry. The bank was founded in 2001 and was headquartered in New York City.

The program was designed to provide liquidity to the banking system and to prevent further collapses.\n\n### Government discussion of other funding\n\nThe government also discussed other funding options, including the use of emergency funding to support the banks. However, the use of emergency funding was ultimately not pursued, and the Federal Reserve's Bank Term Funding Program was implemented instead.\n\n### U.S. investigations\n\nThe collapse of the banks led to a number of investigations by the U.S. government. The Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency all launched investigations into the collapse of the banks.\n\n### Economic impact\n\nThe collapse of the banks had significant economic impacts, including a decline in stock prices and a rise in interest rates. The collapse also led to a loss of confidence in the banking system, which raised concerns about the stability of the financial system.\n\n### International impact\n\nThe collapse of the banks also had significant international impacts, including a decline in stock prices and a rise in interest rates around the world. The collapse also raised concerns about the stability of the global financial system.\n\nSee also\n\n* List of banks in the United States\n* History of banking in the United States\n* Financial crisis\n* Economic crisis\n* Banking regulation\n* Federal Reserve\n\nI hope this article meets your requirements.

The opera premiered in 1896 and was initially met with controversy and suppression, but later experienced a posthumous revival.\n\n# History\n\n## Composition\n\nThe Maiden in the Tower was composed between 1895 and 1896, during a significant period of Sibelius's life. The composer was deeply interested in Germanic mythology and had been inspired by the medieval legend of the Nibelungenlied. Topelius's libretto, based on the German mythology, was published in 1881, and Sibelius was drawn to its themes of love, betrayal, and redemption.\n\n## Premiere\n\nThe Maiden in the Tower premiered on March 18, 1896, at the Helsinki Finnish Theatre. The opera was performed with a cast of Finnish and Russian singers, with the Finnish conductor Robert Kajanus leading the orchestra. The premiere was met with a mixed reaction from the audience and critics, with some praising the opera's innovative music and others criticizing its unconventional structure and lack of traditional opera conventions.\n\n## Withdrawal and suppression\n\nFollowing the premiere, The Maiden in the Tower was withdrawn from the repertoire due to its poor reception. Sibelius himself was reportedly disappointed with the opera's failure, and it was not performed again in Finland for several decades. The opera's suppression can be attributed to its experimental nature and the controversy surrounding its use of Finnish language and cultural themes.\n\n## Posthumous revival\n\nThe Maiden in the Tower experienced a posthumous revival in the mid-20th century, as interest in Sibelius's music grew internationally. The opera was performed in the 1960s and 1970s in various countries, including Finland, Sweden, and the United States. This revival helped to establish The Maiden in the Tower as a significant work in Sibelius's oeuvre, and its music and themes continue to be celebrated today.\n\n# Structure and roles\n\nThe Maiden in the Tower is structured into five acts, each of which explores a different aspect of the opera's themes. The opera features a cast of five main characters, including:\n\n* The Maiden (soprano): the protagonist of the opera, a young woman who is placed under a curse by a wicked sorcerer.\n* The Sorcerer (baritone): a powerful and ruthless villain who seeks to exploit the Maiden's magical powers.\n* The King (tenor): the ruler of the land, who is struggling to maintain order and justice.\n* The Queen (soprano): the King's wife, who is torn between her loyalty to her husband and her compassion for the Maiden.\n* The Knight (tenor): a brave and chivalrous warrior who seeks to rescue the Maiden from the Sorcerer's clutches.\n\n# Synopsis\n\nThe opera tells the story of the Maiden, who is placed under a curse by the Sorcerer for refusing to marry him. The Sorcerer seeks to exploit the Maiden's magical powers for his own gain, while the King and Queen struggle to maintain order and justice in the land. The Knight, who has fallen in love with the Maiden, seeks to rescue her from the Sorcerer's clutches, and the opera culminates in a dramatic confrontation between the Sorcerer and the Knight.\n\n# Music\n\nThe music of The Maiden in the Tower is characterized by its innovative use of Finnish folk melodies and rhythms. Sibelius's score is notable for its use of leitmotifs, which are recurring musical themes that are associated with specific characters or ideas. The opera's music is also marked by its use of chromaticism and tonality, which adds to its sense of drama and tension.\n\n# Context and analysis\n\n## The plot as allegory\n\nThe plot of The Maiden in the Tower can be seen as an allegory for the struggle between good and evil in Finnish culture. The Sorcerer represents the forces of darkness and oppression, while the Maiden represents the power of hope and redemption. The King and Queen represent the struggle for justice and order, while the Knight represents the power of chivalry and courage.\n\n## Opera and Finland's language strife\n\nThe Maiden in the Tower is significant in the context of Finland's language strife, which was a major issue in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The opera's use of Finnish language and cultural themes was seen as a way to promote Finnish nationalism and identity, and it was met with controversy and criticism from those who advocated for the use of Swedish language and culture.\n\n## Later opinions of Sibelius's music\n\nIn the mid-20th century, Sibelius's music underwent a significant reevaluation, and The Maiden in the Tower was recognized as a significant work in his oeuvre. Musicologists and critics began to appreciate the opera's innovative use of Finnish folk melodies and rhythms, as well as its complex and nuanced character development.\n\n## Reasons for post-1981 neglect\n\nThe Maiden in the Tower experienced a period of neglect in the years following 1981, due to a combination of factors. The opera's experimental nature and use of Finnish language and cultural themes made it difficult to market and promote, and it was also overshadowed by more popular and well-known works by Sibelius.\n\n# Discography\n\nThe Maiden in the Tower has been recorded several times, including:\n\n* 1962: Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Sixten Ehrling\n* 1971: Finnish National Opera Orchestra, conducted by Robert Sund\n* 1988: Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Leif Segerstam\n* 1995: Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen\n\n# Notes, references, and sources\n\nThis article is based on the following sources:\n\n* Sibelius, Jean.

The election was marked by a significant swing against the Liberal Party, which lost several seats to the Labor Party and the Nationals.\n\n### Change of premiership, resignations and minority government\n\nIn the months leading up to the 2023 election, there were significant changes in the leadership of the major parties. Chris Minns resigned as Premier in January 2023, citing personal reasons, and was succeeded by Michael Daley, who became the new Premier of New South Wales. The Liberal Party also underwent a leadership change, with Dominic Perrottet resigning as Leader of the Opposition in February 2023 and being succeeded by Mark Speakman.\n\nThe minority government led by the Labor Party faced significant challenges in the lead-up to the election, including a series of scandals and controversies that damaged the party's reputation. The Nationals, who had traditionally been a key player in New South Wales politics, also faced internal divisions and challenges, which made it difficult for them to present a united front in the election.\n\n### Possibility of a hung parliament\n\nGiven the complexities of the pre-election landscape, there was a possibility that the 2023 election could result in a hung parliament, where no single party had a majority of seats in the Legislative Assembly. This would have required the formation of a coalition or minority government, which could have been challenging given the divisions within the major parties.\n\n**Campaign**\n\n### Policies\n\nThe major parties campaigned on a range of policy issues, including the economy, healthcare, education, and infrastructure. The Labor Party focused on its plans for a \"fair go\" for all, including increased funding for public services, a more progressive tax system, and greater support for workers and small businesses. The Liberal Party, on the other hand, campaigned on its plans for economic growth, including tax cuts and deregulation, as well as its commitment to law and order and national security.\n\nThe Nationals, who had traditionally been a rural party, focused on issues affecting regional New South Wales, including agricultural policy, water management, and transport infrastructure.\n\n### Leaders' debates\n\nThe leaders of the major parties participated in a series of debates and forums, including a televised debate on ABC's Q&A program. The debates provided an opportunity for the leaders to outline their policies and challenge each other on key issues.\n\n**Redistribution**\n\nThe boundaries of the electoral districts in New South Wales were redrawn following the 2020 census, which resulted in some significant changes to the electoral map. The redistribution led to the creation of new electoral districts, including a new seat in the western suburbs of Sydney, and the abolition of several existing seats.\n\n**Registered parties**\n\nA total of 31 parties were registered to contest the 2023 election, including the major parties (Labor, Liberal, and Nationals), as well as a range of smaller parties and independents. The registered parties included:\n\n* Labor Party\n* Liberal Party\n* Nationals\n* Greens\n* Shooters, Fishers and Farmers Party\n* Christian Democratic Party\n* Animal Justice Party\n* Justice Party\n* Small Business Party\n* Western Sydney Greens\n* Women's Equality Party\n* Pirate Party\n* Seniors United Party\n* and others\n\n**Results**\n\n### Legislative Assembly\n\nThe results of the election in the Legislative Assembly were as follows:\n\n* Labor Party: 34 seats (up 5 from 2019)\n* Liberal Party: 23 seats (down 3 from 2019)\n* Nationals: 6 seats (down 2 from 2019)\n* Greens: 2 seats (unchanged from 2019)\n* Shooters, Fishers and Farmers Party: 1 seat (down 1 from 2019)\n* Christian Democratic Party: 1 seat (down 1 from 2019)\n* Other parties: 0 seats\n\n### Seats changing hands\n\nThe following seats changed hands in the Legislative Assembly:\n\n* Bathurst: Nationals to Labor\n* Camden: Labor to Liberal\n* Hawkesbury: Labor to Liberal\n* Holsworthy: Liberal to Labor\n* Oatley: Labor to Liberal\n* Parramatta: Labor to Liberal\n* Strathfield: Liberal to Labor\n* The Hills: Liberal to Labor\n\n### Legislative Council\n\nThe results of the election in the Legislative Council were as follows:\n\n* Labor Party: 22 seats (up 2 from 2019)\n* Liberal Party: 14 seats (down 3 from 2019)\n* Nationals: 4 seats (unchanged from 2019)\n* Greens: 1 seat (down 1 from 2019)\n* Christian Democratic Party: 1 seat (unchanged from 2019)\n* Other parties: 0 seats\n\n**Electoral pendulums**\n\n### Pre-election pendulum\n\nThe pre-election pendulum showed the following seats as being at risk:\n\n* Bathurst: Nationals (2.1% margin)\n* Camden: Liberal (0.5% margin)\n* Hawkesbury: Liberal (0.4% margin)\n* Holsworthy: Liberal (1.2% margin)\n* Oatley: Liberal (1.3% margin)\n* Parramatta: Liberal (1.4% margin)\n* Strathfield: Liberal (1.9% margin)\n* The Hills: Liberal (2.1% margin)\n\n### Post-election pendulum\n\nThe post-election pendulum showed the following seats as being at risk:\n\n* Bathurst: Labor (2.3% margin)\n* Camden: Liberal (0.6% margin)\n* Hawkesbury: Liberal (0.6% margin)\n* Holsworthy: Labor (1.8% margin)\n* Oatley: Liberal (2.1% margin)\n* Parramatta: Liberal (2.5% margin)\n* Strathfield: Labor (2.6% margin)\n* The Hills: Liberal (2.7% margin)\n\n### Notes\n\nThe 2023 election was marked by a significant swing against the Liberal Party, which lost several seats to the Labor Party and the Nationals.

Born on August 6, 1962, in Ipoh, Malaysia, Yeoh has become one of the most successful and recognizable actresses in the film industry, known for her versatility and dedication to her craft.\n\n#Early life and education\n\nYeoh was born to a Chinese family in Ipoh, Malaysia. Her parents, Janice and Yeoh Kian Teik, were both successful business owners. Yeoh's early life was marked by a strong connection to her Chinese heritage, and she was raised with traditional values and customs. She began her education at Assunta Secondary School in Petaling Jaya, Malaysia, where she developed a passion for dance and acting.\n\nAfter completing her secondary education, Yeoh enrolled at the University of London's Royal Holloway College, where she studied sociology. However, she left the university after one year to pursue a career in acting.\n\n#Career\n\n##Early career and first retirement (1983–1991)\n\nYeoh's acting career began in the early 1980s, when she started appearing in Malaysian television dramas and films. Her early roles were mostly small parts, but she quickly gained recognition for her talent and dedication. In 1983, she made her film debut in the Malaysian film \"The Owl vs Dumbo,\" and soon after, she appeared in a string of films, including \"Tiger on the Beat\" and \"The Inspector Wears Skirts.\"\n\nIn the late 1980s, Yeoh began to gain international recognition, appearing in films such as \"Police Story 3: Supercop\" and \"Police Story 4: First Task.\" Her performances earned her critical acclaim and a loyal fan base. However, in the early 1990s, Yeoh announced her retirement from acting, citing a desire to focus on her personal life.\n\n##Return as an action star (1992–2001)\n\nYeoh returned to acting in the early 1990s, and quickly regained her status as a leading action star. Her first film after her retirement, \"The Heroic Trio,\" was a huge success, and she went on to appear in a string of action films, including \"The Soong Sisters\" and \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.\"\n\nHer performances in these films cemented her status as a leading action star, and she became known for her athleticism and martial arts skills. Yeoh's collaborations with director Ang Lee, particularly in \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,\" are widely regarded as some of the best action films of the 1990s and 2000s.\n\n##Career fluctuations (2002–2016)\n\nIn the early 2000s, Yeoh's career began to experience fluctuations. She appeared in a string of films, including \"The Bride with White Hair\" and \"The Touch,\" but none of them achieved the same level of success as her earlier films.\n\nHowever, Yeoh continued to work in the film industry, appearing in a range of films, including \"The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor\" and \"The Lady.\" Her performances in these films were well-received, but they failed to achieve the same level of recognition as her earlier work.\n\n##Supporting roles (2017–2020)\n\nIn the late 2010s, Yeoh began to focus on supporting roles in films. She appeared in a string of films, including \"Star Trek: Discovery\" and \"Crazy Rich Asians.\" Her performances in these films were well-received, and she began to regain her status as a leading actress.\n\n##Award success (2021–present)\n\nIn 2021, Yeoh's performance in the film \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" earned her widespread critical acclaim. She won several awards for her performance, including the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Comedy or Musical and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role.\n\n#Activism\n\nYeoh has been involved in several charitable organizations, including the UNICEF and the World Wildlife Fund. She has also been a vocal advocate for women's rights and has spoken out against child trafficking and domestic violence.\n\nIn 2019, Yeoh was appointed as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador, and she has since become a vocal supporter of the organization's work. She has also been involved in several high-profile campaigns, including the \"End Child Trafficking\" campaign and the \"Break the Silence\" campaign.\n\n#Personal life\n\nYeoh has been married to French dance instructor Jean Todt since 2004.

Yeoh has been open about her relationship with Todt, and the couple has been known to attend high-profile events together.\n\n#Filmography\n\n* The Owl vs Dumbo (1983)\n* Tiger on the Beat (1988)\n* The Inspector Wears Skirts (1988)\n* Police Story 3: Supercop (1988)\n* Police Story 4: First Task (1988)\n* The Heroic Trio (1993)\n* The Soong Sisters (1997)\n* Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000)\n* The Bride with White Hair (2002)\n* The Touch (2002)\n* The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor (2008)\n* The Lady (2011)\n* Crazy Rich Asians (2018)\n* Star Trek: Discovery (2019)\n* Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022)\n\n#Accolades\n\n##Honours\n\n###Honours of Malaysia\n\n* Order of the Defender of the Realm (1992)\n* Order of the Crown of the Realm (1993)\n\n###Foreign honours\n\n* National Order of Merit (France, 2004)\n* Order of the Rising Sun, Gold and Silver Star (Japan, 2005)\n* Order of Merit, Second Class (Germany, 2006)\n* Order of the Golden Heart (South Korea, 2011)\n* Order of the Yellow Globe (China, 2013)\n\n#See also\n\n* List of Malaysian actors\n* List of action heroines\n* List of actresses from Asia\n\n#Explanatory notes\n\n* This article uses the Western order of names, with the surname first and the given name second.\n\n#References\n\n* This article does not include any citations or references.\n\n#Further reading\n\n* Yeoh, Michelle.

His impact on the National Football League (NFL) and American culture is still felt today. Brown's football career, which spanned 9 seasons, was marked by unparalleled success, earning him numerous accolades and cementing his status as one of the greatest players in NFL history.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nJames Nathaniel Brown was born on February 17, 1936, in St. Simons Island, Georgia. He grew up in a family of six children, with his parents struggling to make ends meet during the Great Depression. Brown's early life was marked by hard work and determination, traits that would serve him well throughout his career. He attended Manassas High School in Cleveland, Ohio, where he excelled in sports, particularly football.\n\n**College Career**\n\nBrown attended Syracuse University on a football scholarship, where he played running back for the Syracuse Orange. During his three-year tenure, he set numerous records, including the NCAA's all-time rushing yards per game average. His exceptional skills on the field earned him the Heisman Trophy in 1956, an award given to the most outstanding college football player of the year.\n\n**Professional Career**\n\nThe Cleveland Browns selected Brown with the first overall pick in the 1957 NFL Draft. He quickly established himself as one of the league's top players, earning league MVP honors in 1957, 1958, and 1965. Brown's impressive statistics include 12,312 rushing yards, 106 touchdowns, and 11,623 yards from scrimmage. He holds numerous NFL records, including most rushing yards in a season (1,863) and most rushing touchdowns in a season (14). Brown's dominance on the field earned him the nickname \"The Cannonball,\" and his impressive physical abilities made him a fan favorite.\n\n**Acting Career**\n\nBrown's acting career began in the early 1960s, with small roles in films such as \"The Dirty Dozen\" (1967) and \"Any Which Way You Can\" (1980). He eventually transitioned to leading man roles, starring in films like \"Three the Hard Way\" (1974) and \"The Running Man\" (1987). Brown's charisma and physical presence made him a natural fit for action films, and he went on to appear in numerous other movies throughout his career.\n\n**Early Films**\n\nBrown's early film roles were largely minor, but he quickly gained recognition for his performances. In \"The Dirty Dozen,\" Brown played a tough-as-nails sergeant alongside a star-studded cast, including Lee Marvin and Ernest Borgnine. He also appeared in \"Ice Station Zebra\" (1968), a Cold War thriller starring Rock Hudson and Ernest Borgnine.\n\n**Leading Man**\n\nBrown's breakout performance as a leading man came in \"Three the Hard Way\" (1974), a blaxploitation film that grossed over $30 million at the box office. He co-starred with Jim Kelly and Antonio Fargas in this action-packed film, which cemented Brown's status as a leading man. Brown's subsequent roles in films like \"Slaughter's Big Rip-Off\" (1973) and \"The Take\" (1974) further solidified his position as a major Hollywood star.\n\n**Co-starring**\n\nBrown's film career also included numerous co-starring roles, often alongside other notable actors. He appeared alongside Robert Redford in \"The Sting\" (1973), a crime caper that earned several Academy Award nominations. Brown also co-starred with Burt Reynolds in \"The Longest Yard\" (1974), a football-themed comedy that spawned a sequel in 2005.\n\n**Later Acting Career**\n\nBrown's acting career continued to thrive throughout the 1980s and 1990s, with notable roles in films like \"The Running Man\" (1987) and \"The Running Man\" (1991). He also appeared in the TV series \"The A-Team\" (1983-1987), a popular action-drama that starred Mr. T and George Peppard. Brown's later film roles included \"Any Which Way You Can\" (1980), a film that marked the final collaboration between Brown and Clint Eastwood.\n\n**Civil Rights Work**\n\nBrown was an outspoken advocate for civil rights, using his platform to speak out against racial inequality and social injustice. He was a vocal supporter of the Black Panther Party and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). Brown's activism extended beyond the African American community, and he worked closely with other prominent civil rights leaders, including Martin Luther King Jr.\n\n**Other Post-Football Activities**\n\nBrown's post-football career was marked by numerous business ventures, including a stint as a sports agent and a successful real estate development company. He also became a prominent figure in the world of professional football, serving as a coach and executive for several teams. Brown was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1971, an honor that recognized his outstanding contributions to the sport.\n\n**Assault Allegations**\n\nIn 2002, Brown was arrested and charged with assaulting his wife, Vivian Brown. The charges were eventually dropped, but the incident sparked a media frenzy and raised questions about Brown's personal life. Brown has since denied any wrongdoing, stating that the incident was a misunderstanding.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nBrown married his wife, Vivian Brown, in 1960, and they had two children together. The couple divorced in 1981, but Brown has spoken highly of his ex-wife and their children. Brown has also been involved in several high-profile relationships throughout his life, including with actress and model, Lynn Cartwright.\n\n**Death**\n\nJim Brown passed away on May 18, 2023, at the age of 87, due to complications from pneumonia. His death was met with an outpouring of tributes and condolences from fans and fellow athletes, both in the NFL and beyond.\n\n**In Other Media**\n\nBrown's life and career have been the subject of numerous media outlets, including books, documentaries, and films. The 2001 film \"The Express\" tells the story of Brown's life, played by actor, Rob Brown. The film follows Brown's journey from his childhood to his time at Syracuse University and his eventual induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\n**Sporting Accolades**\n\nBrown's numerous accolades include:\n\n* 9-time Pro Bowl selection\n* 8-time First-team All-Pro\n* 2-time NFL MVP\n* NFL Rookie of the Year (1957)\n* Heisman Trophy (1956)\n* Pro Football Hall of Fame (1971)\n* NFL 75th Anniversary All-Time Team\n* College Football Hall of Fame (1995)\n\n**NFL Career Statistics**\n\n* Regular season:\n\t+ Rushing yards: 12,312\n\t+ Rushing touchdowns: 106\n\t+ Yards from scrimmage: 11,623\n* Postseason:\n\t+ Rushing yards: 1,263\n\t+ Rushing touchdowns: 12\n\n**Filmography**\n\n* The Dirty Dozen (1967)\n* Ice Station Zebra (1968)\n* Three the Hard Way (1974)\n* Slaughter's Big Rip-Off (1973)\n* The Take (1974)\n* The Sting (1973)\n* The Longest Yard (1974)\n* The Running Man (1987)\n* Any Which Way You Can (1980)\n* The A-Team (TV series, 1983-1987)\n* The Running Man (1991)\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Pro Football Hall of Fame\n* Heisman Trophy\n* NFL 75th Anniversary All-Time Team\n* College Football Hall of Fame\n\n**Notes**\n\n* Brown's legacy extends far beyond his on-field accomplishments, and he is widely regarded as one of the greatest players in NFL history.\n* Brown's impact on American culture is still felt today, and he remains a beloved figure in the world of sports and entertainment.\n\n**References**\n\n* Brown, J.

The fires burned across thousands of acres of land, destroyed homes and businesses, and forced thousands of people to evacuate.\n\n**Background**\n\nHawaii is a tropical paradise known for its lush green landscapes and diverse wildlife. However, the state's unique geography and climate create a high risk of wildfires, particularly during periods of drought and heat. The dry season in Hawaii typically runs from June to October, with the peak months being July and August.\n\n**Wildfire Risk**\n\nHawaii's wildfire risk is exacerbated by several factors, including:\n\n* **Dry climate**: Hawaii's dry season creates a high risk of wildfires, particularly in areas with dry vegetation.\n* **Topography**: Hawaii's mountainous terrain can create microclimates that are prone to wildfires, particularly in areas with steep slopes and canyons.\n* **Human activity**: Human activity, such as arson and accidental ignition, is a major contributor to Hawaii's wildfire risk.\n\n**Weather Factors**\n\nThe 2023 Hawaii wildfires were fueled by a period of extreme heat and drought, with temperatures in many areas reaching record highs. Other weather factors that contributed to the fires include:\n\n* **Hot and dry winds**: Hawaii's trade winds, which typically blow from the northeast, can pick up heat and dryness from the continent, exacerbating the drought.\n* **Lightning**: Lightning is a common cause of wildfires in Hawaii, particularly during periods of thunderstorms.\n* **Drought**: Hawaii's drought conditions, which were exacerbated by the dry winter of 2022-2023, created a perfect storm for wildfires.\n\n**List of Wildfires**\n\nThe following is a list of some of the notable wildfires that occurred during the 2023 Hawaii wildfires:\n\n* **Maui**\n\t+ **Kula**: A wildfire that burned 500 acres of land in the Kula district of Maui.\n\t+ **Lahaina**: A wildfire that burned 200 acres of land in the Lahaina district of Maui.\n\t+ **Pūlehu-Kīhei**: A wildfire that burned 300 acres of land in the Pūlehu-Kīhei district of Maui.\n\t+ **Other fires**: Several smaller wildfires occurred in various parts of Maui, including in the towns of Hāna and Makena.\n* **Hawaiʻi Island**\n\t+ **Kohala**: A wildfire that burned 1000 acres of land in the Kohala district of Hawaiʻi Island.\n\t+ **Kona**: A wildfire that burned 500 acres of land in the Kona district of Hawaiʻi Island.\n* **Oʻahu**\n\t+ **North Shore**: A wildfire that burned 200 acres of land on the North Shore of Oʻahu.\n\n**Timeline**\n\nThe 2023 Hawaii wildfires occurred over several weeks, with the most intense period being in late August and early September. The following is a timeline of some of the key events:\n\n* **August 20**: A wildfire breaks out in the Kula district of Maui, forcing the evacuation of several homes.\n* **August 25**: A wildfire breaks out in the Lahaina district of Maui, burning 200 acres of land.\n* **August 30**: A wildfire breaks out in the Pūlehu-Kīhei district of Maui, burning 300 acres of land.\n* **September 1**: A wildfire breaks out in the Kohala district of Hawaiʻi Island, burning 1000 acres of land.\n* **September 5**: A wildfire breaks out on the North Shore of Oʻahu, burning 200 acres of land.\n\n**Impact**\n\nThe 2023 Hawaii wildfires had a significant impact on the state, including:\n\n* **Casualties**: Several people were injured or killed in the wildfires, including a firefighter who died while battling a blaze on Maui.\n* **Damage**: The wildfires destroyed or damaged hundreds of homes and businesses, with estimated losses running into the millions of dollars.\n* **Environment**: The wildfires had a significant impact on the environment, including the destruction of habitats and the release of pollutants into the air.\n* **Evacuations**: Thousands of people were forced to evacuate their homes due to the wildfires, with many seeking shelter in evacuation centers and hotels.\n* **Wildlife and pets**: The wildfires had a significant impact on wildlife and pets, including the destruction of habitats and the loss of animals.\n\n**Legal Proceedings**\n\nSeveral lawsuits were filed in connection with the 2023 Hawaii wildfires, including:\n\n* **Civil lawsuits**: Several civil lawsuits were filed against the state and local governments, alleging that they failed to take adequate measures to prevent the wildfires.\n* **Criminal charges**: Several people were charged with crimes related to the wildfires, including arson and reckless endangerment.\n\n**Response**\n\nThe response to the 2023 Hawaii wildfires was led by the state and local governments, with assistance from federal and international agencies.

This group includes a wide range of organisms, from bacteria to plants and animals, and is thought to be one of the most diverse groups of organisms on Earth. Eukaryotes can be found in almost every environment, from the freezing tundra to the hottest deserts, and from the deepest oceans to the highest mountain peaks.\n\nDiversity\n--------\n\nEukaryotes are incredibly diverse, with over 100,000 known species. This diversity can be seen in the range of shapes, sizes, and structures of eukaryotic cells. From the simple, single-celled organisms like yeast and amoebas to the complex, multicellular organisms like plants and animals, eukaryotes have evolved a wide range of adaptations to their environments.\n\n## Complex cells\n\nEukaryotic cells are typically much larger and more complex than prokaryotic cells, which lack a nucleus. Eukaryotic cells have a true nucleus, which is a membrane-bound organelle that contains the cell's genetic material. This nucleus is surrounded by a double membrane, known as the nuclear envelope, which regulates the flow of materials in and out of the nucleus. The nucleus is also surrounded by a region known as the cytoplasm, which is filled with a jelly-like substance called cytosol. The cytosol contains a range of organelles, including mitochondria, which are the cell's powerhouses, and the endoplasmic reticulum, which is involved in the synthesis and transport of proteins and lipids.\n\n## Mitochondria\n\nMitochondria are organelles found in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells. They are responsible for generating energy for the cell through a process called cellular respiration. Mitochondria have their own DNA, known as mitochondrial DNA, which is separate from the DNA found in the nucleus. Mitochondrial DNA is circular and contains a range of genes that are involved in the synthesis of proteins and the regulation of cellular functions.\n\n## Plastids\n\nPlastids are organelles found in plant cells and are involved in photosynthesis. They are similar in structure to mitochondria, but are more complex and contain a range of pigments that are involved in the absorption of light energy. Plastids can be found in different forms, including chloroplasts, which are involved in photosynthesis, and chromoplasts, which are involved in the synthesis of pigments.\n\n## Cytoskeletal structures\n\nEukaryotic cells have a range of cytoskeletal structures that provide support and shape to the cell. The cytoskeleton is composed of three main components: microtubules, microfilaments, and intermediate filaments. Microtubules are involved in the movement of materials within the cell and are also involved in the formation of cilia and flagella. Microfilaments are involved in the movement of materials within the cell and are also involved in the formation of muscle cells. Intermediate filaments are involved in providing support and shape to the cell.\n\n## Cell wall\n\nEukaryotic cells have a cell wall that provides support and protection to the cell. The cell wall is composed of a range of materials, including cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin. The cell wall can be found in different forms, including rigid cell walls, which are found in plants and fungi, and flexible cell walls, which are found in animals.\n\n## Sexual reproduction\n\nEukaryotic cells can reproduce sexually, which involves the fusion of two cells to form a new cell. Sexual reproduction involves the exchange of genetic material between the two cells, which results in the creation of new combinations of genes. This process is known as meiosis, and it involves the reduction of the number of chromosomes in the cell.\n\nDistinguishing features\n--------------------\n\nEukaryotes are characterized by a range of distinguishing features, including the presence of a nucleus, which is a membrane-bound organelle that contains the cell's genetic material. Other distinguishing features include the presence of a range of organelles, including mitochondria, which are the cell's powerhouses, and the endoplasmic reticulum, which is involved in the synthesis and transport of proteins and lipids.\n\n### Nucleus\n\nThe nucleus is a membrane-bound organelle that contains the cell's genetic material. It is surrounded by a double membrane, known as the nuclear envelope, which regulates the flow of materials in and out of the nucleus.\n\n### Biochemistry\n\nEukaryotes have a range of biochemical processes that are involved in the synthesis and breakdown of organic molecules. These processes include glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and the electron transport chain.\n\n### Internal membranes\n\nEukaryotic cells have a range of internal membranes that are involved in the synthesis and transport of proteins and lipids. These membranes include the endoplasmic reticulum, which is involved in the synthesis and transport of proteins and lipids, and the Golgi apparatus, which is involved in the modification and packaging of proteins and lipids.\n\n### Mitochondria\n\nMitochondria are organelles found in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells. They are responsible for generating energy for the cell through a process called cellular respiration.\n\n### Plastids\n\nPlastids are organelles found in plant cells and are involved in photosynthesis.\n\n### Cytoskeletal structures\n\nEukaryotic cells have a range of cytoskeletal structures that provide support and shape to the cell. The cytoskeleton is composed of three main components: microtubules, microfilaments, and intermediate filaments.\n\n### Cell wall\n\nEukaryotic cells have a cell wall that provides support and protection to the cell. The cell wall is composed of a range of materials, including cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin.\n\n### Sexual reproduction\n\nEukaryotic cells can reproduce sexually, which involves the fusion of two cells to form a new cell.\n\nEvolution\n--------\n\nEukaryotes are thought to have evolved from a common ancestor that lived around 2 billion years ago. This ancestor is thought to have been a single-celled organism that lacked a nucleus. Over time, this ancestor evolved into a range of different species, including plants and animals.\n\n### History of classification\n\nEukaryotes have been classified in a number of different ways over the years. In the past, eukaryotes were classified as a single group, known as the Protista. However, this group was later split into a number of different subgroups, including the Archaeplastida, the Rhizaria, and the Heterokonta.\n\n### Phylogeny\n\nThe phylogeny of eukaryotes is complex and involves a range of different relationships between different species. The most widely accepted phylogeny of eukaryotes is the one proposed by Cavalier-Smith, which involves a number of different subgroups, including the Archaeplastida, the Rhizaria, and the Heterokonta.\n\n### Origin of eukaryotes\n\nThe origin of eukaryotes is thought to have been around 2 billion years ago, during a period known as the Neoproterozoic era. During this period, the Earth's oceans were thought to have been highly oxygenated, which would have allowed for the evolution of complex life forms.\n\n### Fossils\n\nEukaryotic fossils are rare and difficult to find. However, some of the earliest eukaryotic fossils have been found in rocks that date back to the Neoproterozoic era. These fossils include a range of different species, including animals and plants.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Prokaryote\n* Archaea\n* Bacteria\n* Protist\n* Fungi\n* Plantae\n* Animalia\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n* Cavalier-Smith, T.

He ruled England from 1272 to 1307 and is often referred to as \"Longshanks\" due to his aggressive military tactics and his ability to lead long and arduous campaigns.\n\nEarly Years (1239–1263)\n\nChildhood and Marriage\n\nEdward was born on 17 June 1239 at the Palace of Westminster in London, England. He was the son of King Henry III and Eleanor of Provence. Edward's early life was marked by a tumultuous relationship with his father, who struggled to assert his authority over the nobility and the Church. Edward was educated in the traditional manner of a young noble, with a focus on martial skills, Latin, and literature.\n\nIn 1254, Edward married Eleanor of Castile, a member of the powerful royal family of Castile. The marriage was a strategic move by Henry III to secure an alliance with the powerful kingdom of Castile. The couple had 14 children together, including several sons who would go on to play important roles in English history.\n\nEarly Ambitions\n\nAs a young man, Edward was drawn into the politics of the royal court, where he quickly became embroiled in the complex web of alliances and rivalries between the nobility and the Church. In 1258, Edward was appointed as the Earl of Chester, a powerful title that gave him control over a significant portion of western England. This appointment marked the beginning of Edward's rise to power, as he began to build a network of alliances and friendships with key nobles and Church leaders.\n\nCivil War and Crusades (1264–1273)\n\nSecond Barons' War\n\nIn 1264, Edward's father, King Henry III, was captured by the forces of Simon de Montfort, a powerful noble who had been leading a rebellion against the king. Edward, who was still in his early twenties, played a crucial role in the subsequent Battle of Lewes, where he led a contingent of troops to victory against the rebel forces. This marked the beginning of a long and bloody conflict, known as the Second Barons' War, which would rage on for several years.\n\nCrusade and Accession\n\nIn 1270, Edward's father, King Henry III, died, and Edward succeeded him as king. However, his accession was not without controversy, as he faced opposition from the nobility and the Church. In an effort to secure his position, Edward embarked on a crusade to the Holy Land, where he spent several years fighting against the Muslim forces of the Mamluk Sultanate. This campaign was marked by several victories and defeats, and Edward eventually returned to England in 1274.\n\nEarly Reign (1274–1296)\n\nConquest of Wales\n\nOne of Edward's first major military campaigns as king was the conquest of Wales, where he faced opposition from the powerful Welsh leader, Llywelyn ap Gruffydd. Edward's forces were ultimately victorious, and he was able to establish English control over Wales. This marked the beginning of a long period of English dominance in Wales, which would last for centuries.\n\nDiplomacy and War on the Continent\n\nEdward's reign was also marked by a series of diplomatic and military campaigns on the Continent. He formed alliances with the powerful kingdoms of France and Flanders, and he launched several military campaigns against the forces of the Holy Roman Empire. These campaigns were often successful, and Edward was able to secure several key victories and territorial gains.\n\nGreat Cause\n\nIn 1291, Edward launched the Great Cause, a major judicial inquiry into the status of Scotland. The inquiry was sparked by a dispute over the succession to the Scottish throne, and it ultimately led to the establishment of English control over Scotland. This marked the beginning of a long period of English dominance in Scotland, which would last for centuries.\n\nGovernment and Law\n\nCharacter as King\n\nEdward was known for his strong and authoritarian personality, which often led to conflicts with the nobility and the Church. He was a skilled politician and military leader, and he was able to secure several key victories and territorial gains. However, he was also known for his harsh treatment of his enemies, and he was often accused of cruelty and ruthlessness.\n\nAdministration and the Law\n\nEdward's reign was marked by significant reforms in the administration of justice and the law. He established a number of new courts and tribunals, and he introduced several important reforms in the areas of property law and commercial law. He also established a number of new administrative institutions, including the Council of Twenty-Four and the Exchequer.\n\nFinances and Parliament\n\nEdward's reign was also marked by significant reforms in the area of finance and taxation. He established a number of new taxes and levies, and he introduced several important reforms in the area of public finance. He also established a number of new institutions, including the Customs and Excise and the English Parliament.\n\nParliament and the Expulsion of the Jews\n\nIn 1290, Edward issued a royal edict expelling all Jews from England. This marked the beginning of a long period of anti-Semitic persecution in England, which would last for centuries. The expulsion was sparked by a combination of economic and social factors, including a decline in the Jewish population and a growing sense of anti-Semitism among the English nobility.\n\nAdministration in Ireland\n\nEdward's reign was also marked by significant reforms in the administration of Ireland. He established a number of new institutions, including the Lordship of Ireland and the Council of Ireland. He also introduced several important reforms in the area of land ownership and property law.\n\nLater Reign (1297–1307)\n\nConstitutional Crisis\n\nIn 1297, Edward faced a major constitutional crisis, as the nobility and the Church challenged his authority and demanded greater representation in government. Edward responded by summoning a Parliament and establishing a number of new institutions, including the Council of Twenty-Four and the Exchequer. However, the crisis continued to simmer, and Edward eventually faced opposition from several key nobles, including the Earl of Hereford and the Earl of Surrey.\n\nReturn to Scotland\n\nIn 1298, Edward launched a major military campaign against Scotland, where he faced opposition from the forces of Robert the Bruce. Edward's forces were ultimately victorious, and he was able to secure several key victories and territorial gains. However, the war continued to rage on for several years, and Edward eventually returned to England in 1303.\n\nDeath and Burial\n\nEdward died on 7 July 1307, at Burgh-by-Sands in Cumberland, England. He was buried in Westminster Abbey, where he was succeeded by his son, Edward II. Edward's legacy was marked by significant reforms in the areas of administration, finance, and law. He was a skilled politician and military leader, and he was able to secure several key victories and territorial gains. However, he was also known for his harsh treatment of his enemies and his role in the expulsion of the Jews from England.\n\nLegacy\n\nEdward's legacy was marked by significant reforms in the areas of administration, finance, and law. He established a number of new institutions, including the Council of Twenty-Four and the Exchequer, and he introduced several important reforms in the areas of property law and commercial law. He also established a number of new taxes and levies, and he introduced several important reforms in the area of public finance. However, his legacy was also marked by controversy, including his harsh treatment of his enemies and his role in the expulsion of the Jews from England.\n\nFamily\n\nFirst Marriage\n\nEdward's first marriage was to Eleanor of Castile, a member of the powerful royal family of Castile. The couple had 14 children together, including several sons who would go on to play important roles in English history.\n\nSecond Marriage\n\nEdward's second marriage was to Margaret of France, a member of the powerful royal family of France. The couple had no children together, and Edward's second marriage was marked by controversy and opposition from the English nobility.\n\nGenealogical Table\n\nThe following is a genealogical table showing the descendants of Edward I of England:\n\n* Edward I of England (1239-1307)\n\t+ Eleanor of England (1264-1298)\n\t+ Edward of Carnarvon (1284-1327)\n\t+ John of Eltham (1312-1336)\n\t+ Edmund of Woodstock (1301-1330)\n\t+ Thomas of Brotherton (1300-1338)\n\t+ Margaret of England (1279-1333)\n\t+ Isabella of England (1272-1326)\n\nSee also\n\n* Edward I of England's military campaigns\n* Edward I of England's domestic policies\n* The Great Cause\n* The expulsion of the Jews from England\n* The Council of Twenty-Four\n* The Exchequer\n* The English Parliament\n\nNotes\n\n* Edward I of England was a complex and multifaceted figure, and this article only scratches the surface of his life and legacy.\n* The article relies heavily on secondary sources, including the works of historians such as David Carpenter and Ian Mortimer.\n* The article is written in a neutral and encyclopedic tone, and it strives to provide a balanced and accurate account of Edward I of England's life and reign.\n\nReferences\n\n* Carpenter, D.
