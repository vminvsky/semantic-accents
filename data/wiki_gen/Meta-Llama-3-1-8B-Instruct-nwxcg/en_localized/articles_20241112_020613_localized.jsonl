He is best known for his role as the commander of the Army of the Potomac at the Battle of Gettysburg, a turning point in the war.\n\n**Early life and education**\n\nMeade was born in Cádiz, Spain, to a family of American expatriates. His father, Richard Worsam Meade, was a navy captain and a member of a prominent Philadelphia family. Meade's early life was marked by frequent moves between Spain, England, and the United States. He attended the United States Military Academy at West Point, graduating in 1835 and receiving a commission as a second lieutenant in the United States Army Corps of Topographical Engineers.\n\n**Topographical Corps and Mexican-American War**\n\nMeade spent several years working on surveys and mapping projects for the Corps of Topographical Engineers, including a notable expedition to the Great Lakes region. During the Mexican-American War, Meade served as a lieutenant colonel on the staff of General Zachary Taylor, participating in several key battles, including the Battle of Monterrey. After the war, Meade returned to the United States and worked on various topographical projects, including a survey of the Great Lakes.\n\n**American Civil War**\n\nMeade's experience in the Mexican-American War and his work as a topographical engineer prepared him for a key role in the American Civil War. He joined the Union Army in 1861 and rapidly rose through the ranks, becoming a brigadier general in 1861 and a major general in 1862.\n\n### **Peninsula campaign**\n\nMeade served as a division commander in the Army of the Potomac under General George McClellan during the Peninsula campaign in 1862. He played a key role in several battles, including the Battle of Williamsburg and the Battle of Seven Pines.\n\n### **Maryland campaign**\n\nMeade continued to serve under McClellan during the Maryland campaign in 1862, participating in the Battle of South Mountain and the Battle of Antietam.\n\n### **Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville**\n\nAfter McClellan's removal from command, Meade served under General Ambrose Burnside during the Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville campaigns. He was not involved in the Battle of Fredericksburg, but he played a key role in the Battle of Chancellorsville, where he commanded a corps of troops that fought against General Robert E. Lee's forces.\n\n### **Gettysburg campaign**\n\nMeade's most notable role in the war came during the Gettysburg campaign in 1863. He was promoted to major general and took command of the Army of the Potomac just before the Battle of Gettysburg.\n\n#### **Command of the Army of the Potomac**\n\nMeade's command of the Army of the Potomac was marked by controversy and criticism from some of his fellow generals, including General Daniel Sickles, who was relieved of his command during the battle. Despite these challenges, Meade led the army to a decisive victory at Gettysburg, repelling Lee's invasion of the North.\n\n#### **Battle of Gettysburg**\n\nThe Battle of Gettysburg was a turning point in the war, as Lee's army suffered heavy casualties and was forced to retreat back to Virginia. Meade's army played a key role in the battle, with his corps commanders, including General Winfield Scott Hancock, fighting bravely on the second day of the battle.\n\n#### **Lee's retreat**\n\nAfter the Battle of Gettysburg, Lee's army retreated back to Virginia, pursued by Meade's army. Meade's forces were unable to destroy Lee's army, but they were able to prevent them from invading the North again.\n\n### **Bristoe and Mine Run campaign**\n\nMeade's army continued to pursue Lee's forces during the Bristoe and Mine Run campaigns in 1863. However, Meade's forces were unable to destroy Lee's army, and the campaigns ended in stalemate.\n\n### **Overland campaign**\n\nIn 1864, Meade's army participated in the Overland campaign, a series of battles fought against Lee's army as they moved through the Shenandoah Valley. Meade's forces were involved in several key battles, including the Battle of the Wilderness and the Battle of Cold Harbor.\n\n### **Richmond-Petersburg campaign**\n\nMeade's army also participated in the Richmond-Petersburg campaign, a series of battles fought against Lee's army as they tried to capture Richmond, the capital of the Confederacy. Meade's forces were involved in several key battles, including the Battle of Petersburg and the Battle of Richmond.\n\n### **Political rivalries**\n\nMeade was involved in several political rivalries during the war, including a dispute with General Ulysses S. Grant over command of the Army of the Potomac. Meade's supporters argued that he was the most qualified general to lead the army, while Grant's supporters argued that he was more effective in battle.\n\n**Reconstruction**\n\nAfter the war, Meade served as a military governor of Georgia and later as a member of the military commission that tried several Confederate generals for treason. He was also involved in the Reconstruction of the South, serving as a governor of the District of Columbia and a member of the board of visitors of the United States Military Academy.\n\n**Personal life**\n\nMeade was married to Margaretta Sergeant Meade in 1846, and the couple had two daughters. He was known for his strong personality and his love of horses.\n\n**Later life and death**\n\nMeade died on November 6, 1872, at the age of 56, due to complications from a stroke. He was buried in the family vault in Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nMeade's legacy as a general is complex and multifaceted. He was involved in several key battles and played a crucial role in the Union victory. However, he was also criticized for his leadership style and his inability to destroy Lee's army. Today, Meade is remembered as a skilled and dedicated general who played a key role in the American Civil War.\n\n### **Memorials to Meade**\n\nThere are several memorials to Meade throughout the United States, including a statue in Gettysburg National Military Park and a monument in Arlington National Cemetery.\n\n**In popular culture**\n\nMeade has been portrayed in several films and books, including the film \"Gettysburg\" and the novel \"The Killer Angels.\" He is often depicted as a key figure in the Battle of Gettysburg and the American Civil War.\n\n**Dates of rank**\n\n* Second lieutenant, United States Army Corps of Topographical Engineers, 1835\n* Lieutenant colonel, United States Army Corps of Topographical Engineers, 1841\n* Brigadier general, United States Volunteers, 1861\n* Major general, United States Volunteers, 1862\n* Major general, United States Army, 1864\n\n**See also**\n\n* American Civil War\n* Battle of Gettysburg\n* Gettysburg National Military Park\n* George McClellan\n* Ulysses S.

The film is a dark reimagining of the classic children's stories by A.A. Milne, specifically focusing on the character of Winnie-the-Pooh and his interactions with Piglet. The film premiered at the Fantastic Fest in September 2023 and received widespread attention for its graphic and disturbing content.\n\nPlot\n\nWinnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey deviates significantly from the original stories by A.A. Milne. The film takes place in a dark and twisted version of the Hundred Acre Wood, where Winnie-the-Pooh and Piglet are depicted as violent and bloodthirsty. The story follows the two characters as they stalk and hunt their friends, including Eeyore, Tigger, and Rabbit.\n\nThe film's narrative is non-linear, jumping between different scenes of violence and trauma. Winnie-the-Pooh and Piglet are shown to be the dominant characters, with the other animals in the forest cowering in fear. The film's protagonist, Piglet, is portrayed as the more sadistic and violent of the two, often taking pleasure in causing pain and suffering to others.\n\nThe plot is also marked by a sense of confusion and disorientation, with the characters' actions and motivations seemingly random and unpredictable. The film's use of long takes and unsettling sound design adds to the sense of unease and discomfort.\n\nCast\n\nThe film features a cast of adult actors playing the roles of the classic children's characters. The main cast includes:\n\n* Paul Candy as Winnie-the-Pooh\n* Payson Lewis as Piglet\n* Tristan Ellison as Eeyore\n* Ty Olsson as Rabbit\n* Noah Johnston as Tigger\n\nProduction\n\n### Development\n\nWinnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey was developed by Rhys Waterfield, who was inspired by the classic children's stories by A.A. Milne. Waterfield has stated that he was drawn to the idea of reimagining the characters in a darker and more sinister way, exploring the themes of violence and trauma. The film's script was written over the course of several years, with Waterfield working closely with a team of writers and editors.\n\n### Filming\n\nFilming for Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey took place over several months in 2022, primarily in the United Kingdom. The film was shot on location in the countryside, with the production team using a combination of practical and CGI effects to create the film's surreal and unsettling atmosphere.\n\nThe film's cinematographer, Laura Bellingham, has stated that she was drawn to the project's unique aesthetic, which combines elements of horror and fantasy. Bellingham worked closely with Waterfield to create a visual style that was both dark and unsettling, using a combination of long takes and close-ups to create a sense of tension and unease.\n\n### Music\n\nThe film's score was composed by Tom Hodge, who has worked on a number of horror films and TV shows. Hodge's score for Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey is a dark and unsettling mix of electronic and orchestral elements, perfectly capturing the film's sense of unease and discomfort.\n\nRelease\n\n### Marketing\n\nWinnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey was marketed as a horror film, with the production team releasing a number of trailers and promotional materials that highlighted the film's graphic and disturbing content. The film's marketing campaign was successful, with the film generating widespread attention and buzz on social media.\n\n### Home media\n\nWinnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey was released on DVD and Blu-ray in November 2023, with a number of special features and bonus materials. The film's home release was successful, with the film selling well in the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\nReception\n\n### Box office\n\nWinnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey was a commercial success, grossing over $10 million at the box office worldwide. The film's box office performance was strong, particularly in the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\n### Critical response\n\nWinnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey received a mixed critical response, with some critics praising the film's unique aesthetic and atmospheric sound design. However, others criticized the film's graphic content and lack of coherence.\n\n### Accolades\n\nWinnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey was nominated for several awards, including the 2024 Fantastic Fest Award for Best Horror Film. The film's score by Tom Hodge was also nominated for the 2024 British Independent Film Award for Best Original Music.\n\nFuture\n\n### Sequel\n\nThere are plans to develop a sequel to Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey, with Rhys Waterfield stating that he has a number of ideas for the next film in the series. However, no official announcement has been made, and it is unclear when the sequel will be released.\n\n### Shared universe and other projects\n\nWinnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey is part of a larger shared universe of horror films, with Waterfield and his team working on a number of other projects that explore similar themes and ideas. The shared universe is still in its early stages, but it promises to be an exciting and unsettling exploration of the horror genre.\n\nSee also\n\n* Winnie-the-Pooh\n* A.A.

With a career spanning over five decades, Hersh has been a prominent voice in American journalism, earning numerous awards and accolades for his work.\n\nEarly life and education\n------------------------\n\nSeymour Myron Hersh was born on April 8, 1937, in Chicago, Illinois, to a Jewish family. His father, Al Hersh, was a Polish immigrant who worked as a tailor, and his mother, Dora Hersh, was a homemaker. Hersh grew up in a working-class neighborhood and developed an early interest in journalism, inspired by his mother's love of reading and his father's stories about the struggles of immigrant life.\n\nHersh attended South Shore High School in Chicago, where he began writing for the school newspaper. He later attended the University of Chicago, where he studied history and philosophy, but did not graduate. Instead, he dropped out to pursue a career in journalism.\n\nNewspaper career\n----------------\n\nHersh began his career in journalism as a reporter for the _New York City Herald Tribune_ in 1959. He later moved to the _Associated Press_ and covered the Civil Rights Movement, including the Freedom Rides and the Selma to Montgomery marches. In 1963, Hersh joined the _New York Times_ as a national correspondent, where he covered the Vietnam War and the Pentagon.\n\nMy Lai massacre\n-----------------\n\nOne of Hersh's most notable investigations was his exposé of the My Lai massacre in 1969. On March 16, 1968, American soldiers from Charlie Company, 1st Battalion, 20th Infantry Regiment, killed hundreds of unarmed Vietnamese civilians in the village of My Lai. The incident was covered up by the US military, but Hersh's reporting revealed the horrific details of the massacre, including the use of napalm and the slaughter of women and children.\n\nThe New York Times\n------------------\n\nHersh's reporting on the My Lai massacre was published in the _New York Times_ on November 12, 1969. The article was a major scandal for the US military and led to widespread outrage and protests. Hersh's reporting also led to the resignation of General William Peers, who was appointed to investigate the massacre.\n\nInvestigative books: 1980s and 1990s\n-----------------------------------\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, Hersh turned to writing books, including _The Price of Power: Kissinger in the Nixon White House_ (1983) and _The Target Is Destroyed: What Really Happened to Flight 007 and Its Passengers_ (1986). His book _Samuel and Hank: A Memoir of the End of an Era_ (1996) was a critical biography of former _Time_ magazine editor Henry Luce and his son, Hank Luce.\n\nLater investigations\n---------------------\n\nHersh continued to investigate government secrets and corruption in the 2000s and 2010s. Some of his notable investigations include:\n\n### Iraq and Abu Ghraib\n\nIn 2004, Hersh reported on the abuse of Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison, including the use of torture and sexual humiliation. His reporting exposed the extent of the abuse and led to widespread outrage and calls for accountability.\n\n### Iran\n\nIn 2010, Hersh reported on the CIA's secret operations in Iran, including the use of assassins and sabotage. His reporting revealed the extent of the CIA's involvement in Iranian politics and sparked controversy.\n\n### Syria and chemical attacks\n\nIn 2014, Hersh reported on the US government's claim that Syria had used chemical weapons against its own citizens. His reporting revealed that the evidence was flawed and that the US government had manipulated the intelligence to justify military action.\n\n### Killing of Osama bin Laden\n\nIn 2015, Hersh reported on the US government's account of the killing of Osama bin Laden in 2011. His reporting revealed that the US government had manipulated the story of the raid and that the operation was more complex than initially reported.\n\n### Nord Stream pipeline and Ukraine\n\nIn 2022, Hersh reported on the US government's involvement in the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipeline, which runs from Russia to Germany. His reporting revealed that the US government had been involved in the sabotage and that it was part of a larger effort to undermine Russia's energy interests.\n\nOther statements\n-----------------\n\n### Speeches\n\nHersh has given numerous speeches on government secrecy and corruption, including a 2010 speech at the National Press Club in which he criticized the Obama administration's handling of the war in Afghanistan.\n\n### Murder of Seth Rich\n\nIn 2017, Hersh gave a speech in which he suggested that the murder of DNC staffer Seth Rich was connected to the hacking of the DNC's email server. His comments sparked controversy and were later disputed.\n\n### Pat Nixon abuse\n\nIn 2019, Hersh reported on the allegations of abuse made by Pat Nixon, the wife of former President Richard Nixon, against her husband. His reporting revealed that Pat Nixon had made allegations of abuse in the 1970s, but that they had been ignored by the media.\n\nUse of anonymous sources\n-------------------------\n\nHersh has been known to use anonymous sources in his reporting, which has sometimes led to controversy. In 2010, he was criticized for using unnamed sources in a story about the CIA's secret operations in Iran.\n\nPersonal life\n-------------\n\nHersh has been married three times and has two children. He lives in Washington, D.C.\n\nAwards and honors\n------------------\n\nHersh has won numerous awards for his reporting, including:\n\n* Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting (1970)\n* George Polk Award (1970)\n* National Magazine Award (1983)\n* James Aronson Award for Investigative Journalism (2004)\n* George Polk Award for National Reporting (2010)\n\nPublications\n------------\n\n### Books\n\n* _My Lai 4: A Report on the Massacre and Its Aftermath_ (1970)\n* _The Price of Power: Kissinger in the Nixon White House_ (1983)\n* _The Target Is Destroyed: What Really Happened to Flight 007 and Its Passengers_ (1986)\n* _Samuel and Hank: A Memoir of the End of an Era_ (1996)\n* _Chain of Command: The Road from 9/11 to Abu Ghraib_ (2004)\n* _The Dark Side of Camelot_ (1997)\n* _The Obama Wars_ (2010)\n* _The Killing of Osama bin Laden_ (2015)\n* _The Nord Stream Pipeline Sabotage_ (2022)\n\n### Articles\n\n* \"My Lai 4: A Report on the Massacre and Its Aftermath\" (1970)\n* \"The Price of Power: Kissinger in the Nixon White House\" (1983)\n* \"The Target Is Destroyed: What Really Happened to Flight 007 and Its Passengers\" (1986)\n* \"Samuel and Hank: A Memoir of the End of an Era\" (1996)\n* \"Chain of Command: The Road from 9/11 to Abu Ghraib\" (2004)\n* \"The Dark Side of Camelot\" (1997)\n* \"The Obama Wars\" (2010)\n* \"The Killing of Osama bin Laden\" (2015)\n* \"The Nord Stream Pipeline Sabotage\" (2022)\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n* \"Seymour Hersh: A Biography\" by William M.

He is one of the most infamous figures in French history, known for his alleged involvement in child murders and occult activities. This article will examine his life, military career, and the circumstances surrounding his trial and execution.\n\nHouse of Retz\n\nGilles de Rais was a member of the House of Retz, a powerful noble family in medieval France. The family's history dates back to the 11th century, and they played a significant role in French politics and society.\n\nEarly life\n\nGilles de Rais was born in 1404 in Champtocé, Maine, to Guy de Rais and Marie de Craon. He was the youngest of three sons, and his family was known for their wealth and influence. Gilles received a good education, studying at the University of Poitiers, where he developed a passion for literature and the arts.\n\nMatrimonial projects\n\nIn 1420, Gilles de Rais was married to Catherine de Thouars, a member of the powerful House of Thouars. The marriage was arranged to secure an alliance between the two families, but it was not a happy one. Catherine was known for her beauty and intelligence, but she was also strong-willed and independent, which often put her at odds with Gilles.\n\nFamily disputes\n\nGilles de Rais's family was known for their complex web of alliances and rivalries. His older brother, Jean de Rais, was a rival of the powerful Duke of Burgundy, and this led to a series of conflicts between the two families. Gilles was also involved in a dispute with his cousin, Louis de Rais, who was a member of the rival House of Laval.\n\nTitles, estates, and wealth\n\nGilles de Rais inherited a significant portion of his family's wealth and titles, including the lordship of Champtocé and the county of Retz. He also received a large sum of money from his marriage to Catherine de Thouars. However, he was known for his lavish spending and his love of luxury, which led to significant financial problems.\n\nMilitary career\n\nGilles de Rais began his military career in 1415, fighting in the Hundred Years' War against the English. He quickly rose through the ranks, becoming a captain in the French army and earning a reputation as a skilled and courageous leader.\n\nFirst hypothetical feat of arms\n\nGilles de Rais's first military victory was in 1417, when he led a group of soldiers in a successful raid against an English garrison in the town of Laval. This victory earned him recognition and praise from his superiors, and he was soon promoted to the rank of lieutenant.\n\nFranco-Breton alliance through the House of Valois-Anjou\n\nIn 1420, Gilles de Rais became involved in a plot to form an alliance between the French and the Bretons. The alliance was brokered by the powerful Duke of Anjou, who saw it as a way to weaken the English and gain greater control over the region. Gilles de Rais played a key role in negotiating the terms of the alliance, and he was rewarded with a significant amount of land and wealth.\n\nGuerilla warfare against English garrisons on the borders of Maine\n\nGilles de Rais continued to fight against the English in Maine, using guerrilla tactics to harass and disrupt their supply lines. He was known for his bravery and cunning, and he earned the respect of his enemies for his skill and determination.\n\nCompanion in arms with Joan of Arc\n\nIn 1429, Gilles de Rais met Joan of Arc, who was leading a campaign to drive the English out of France. He joined her army and fought alongside her in several battles, including the siege of Orléans. Although their relationship was close, it was also complicated, and some historians have suggested that Joan may have seen Gilles as a rival or even a potential lover.\n\nCivil wars between La Trémoille and Richemont's allies\n\nAfter the siege of Orléans, Gilles de Rais became embroiled in a series of civil wars between the powerful nobles La Trémoille and Richemont. He fought on behalf of La Trémoille, but his loyalty was eventually rewarded with the title of Marshal of France.\n\nLifting of the siege of Lagny\n\nIn 1430, Gilles de Rais led a successful campaign to lift the siege of Lagny, a town in the Île-de-France region. The siege had been laid by a group of English soldiers, but Gilles de Rais and his men were able to drive them off and secure the town.\n\nReduction of military commitments\n\nIn 1432, Gilles de Rais was forced to reduce his military commitments due to financial difficulties. He was no longer able to afford the cost of maintaining a large army, and he was forced to rely on the support of his allies to continue fighting.\n\nSquandering of heritage\n\nGilles de Rais's financial problems were exacerbated by his lavish spending and his love of luxury. He was known for his extravagance, and he often spent large sums of money on unnecessary items, such as jewelry, fine clothes, and lavish feasts. This squandering of his heritage would eventually lead to significant financial problems.\n\nCriminal life\n\nGilles de Rais's life took a dark turn in the 1430s, when he became involved in a series of crimes, including occultism and child murder. He was known to have a fascination with the occult, and he was said to have performed rituals and sacrifices in his castle at Champtocé.\n\nOccult involvement\n\nGilles de Rais was said to have been involved in a series of occult rituals and sacrifices, including human sacrifice. Some historians have suggested that he may have been a member of a secret society or cult, but there is no concrete evidence to support this claim.\n\nChild murders\n\nGilles de Rais was accused of murdering dozens of children, many of whom were orphans or beggars. He was said to have lured them to his castle with promises of food and", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

It originated in the Middle East in the 1st century AD and has since spread to every corner of the globe, influencing culture, politics, and society in countless ways. This article will explore the history of Christianity, from its Jewish background to the present day.\n\n**#Early Christianity**\n\n#####Jewish background\n\nChristianity emerged from Judaism, a monotheistic faith that originated in the 6th century BC. The Hebrew Bible, also known as the Old Testament, was the sacred scripture of the Jewish people and contained the history of their relationship with God. The Jewish people believed in one God, who had created the world and was involved in the affairs of humanity. However, the Jewish people also believed in a complex system of laws and rituals, known as the Torah, which governed their behavior and worship.\n\n#####Apostolic Age (c. 30–100)\n\nThe apostolic age, which began with the life and ministry of Jesus Christ, was a time of great change and upheaval in the Jewish world. Jesus, a Jewish teacher and prophet, preached a message of love, forgiveness, and salvation, which attracted a large following of Jews and Gentiles (non-Jews) alike. After Jesus' death and resurrection, his followers, known as the apostles, continued to preach and teach his message, establishing the first Christian communities in Jerusalem and other parts of the Mediterranean world.\n\n######Developing church structure\n\nAs the Christian communities grew and spread, a need arose for a more formalized structure to govern and organize the church. The apostles, who had been the leaders of the early Christian communities, began to establish a hierarchy of leadership, with bishops and deacons serving as the primary leaders of the church. This developing church structure would eventually become the basis for the Catholic Church, which would dominate Christianity for centuries to come.\n\n######Early growth\n\nThe early Christian communities experienced rapid growth, as more and more people were drawn to the message of Jesus Christ. The apostles and other early Christian leaders traveled extensively, preaching and teaching, and establishing new communities in cities and towns across the Mediterranean world. Despite facing persecution and opposition from Jewish and Roman authorities, the Christian communities continued to grow and thrive, laying the foundation for the spread of Christianity throughout the ancient world.\n\n#####Ante-Nicene period (100–312)\n\nThe ante-Nicene period, which spanned from the early 2nd century to the end of the 4th century, was a time of great turmoil and upheaval in the Christian world. The Christian communities faced intense persecution from Roman authorities, who saw Christianity as a threat to their power and authority. However, the Christian communities also experienced a period of rapid growth and expansion, as more and more people were drawn to the message of Jesus Christ.\n\n######Scripture\n\nDuring the ante-Nicene period, the Christian communities began to develop a canon of scripture, which would eventually become the Bible. The New Testament, which contains the writings of the apostles and other early Christian leaders, was written during this period, and the Old Testament, which was based on the Hebrew Bible, was also translated into Greek and other languages.\n\n######Early Christian art\n\nEarly Christian art was characterized by its use of symbolism and imagery, which conveyed the message of Christianity to a largely illiterate population. The early Christian communities used a range of artistic expressions, including mosaics, frescoes, and sculptures, to depict scenes from the Bible and the life of Jesus Christ.\n\n######Persecutions and legalization\n\nThe Christian communities faced intense persecution from Roman authorities during the ante-Nicene period, with many Christians being martyred for their faith. However, in the 4th century, Emperor Constantine, who had converted to Christianity, issued the Edict of Milan, which granted toleration to Christians and paved the way for the legalization of Christianity.\n\n#####Spread of Christianity to c. 300 AD\n\nThe spread of Christianity during the ante-Nicene period was rapid and widespread, with the Christian communities growing and expanding throughout the Mediterranean world. Christianity spread to every corner of the ancient world, from Britain to Egypt, and from Spain to Syria.\n\n######Inclusivity, women and exclusivity\n\nThe early Christian communities were characterized by their inclusivity, with people from all walks of life being welcomed into the church. Women played a significant role in the early Christian communities, serving as leaders and teachers, and the church was open to people of all social classes and backgrounds. However, the early Christian communities also exhibited exclusivity, with many Christians viewing themselves as a separate and distinct group from the wider society.\n\n######Moral practices\n\nThe early Christian communities were known for their high moral standards, with Christians being expected to live a life of love, forgiveness, and compassion. The early Christian communities also emphasized the importance of charity and service, with many Christians engaging in acts of kindness and generosity towards those in need.\n\n**#Late antiquity (313–476)**\n\n#####Conversion of Constantine\n\nThe conversion of Emperor Constantine to Christianity in the 4th century marked a turning point in the history of Christianity. Constantine, who had issued the Edict of Milan, which granted toleration to Christians, became a powerful ally of the church and helped to establish Christianity as the dominant religion of the Roman Empire.\n\n######Christianity and the state\n\nThe relationship between Christianity and the state during the late antiquity period was complex and multifaceted. While the church was granted a significant amount of autonomy, it was also subject to the authority of the state, and the church was expected to play a role in the governance of the empire.\n\n######Christianity and polytheism\n\nThe relationship between Christianity and polytheism during the late antiquity period was also complex and multifaceted.

While Augustine acknowledged the importance of Judaism and the role that Jews played in the history of salvation, he also saw Jews as a people who had rejected the message of Jesus Christ and were therefore outside of the church.\n\n#####Developing orthodoxy and heresy\n\nThe late antiquity period was a time of great theological controversy in the Christian world, with many different groups emerging that emphasized different aspects of the Christian faith. The process of developing orthodoxy and heresy was complex and multifaceted, with the church ultimately establishing a set of doctrines that were seen as authoritative and true.\n\n#####Church of the East\n\nThe Church of the East, also known as the Nestorian Church, was a Christian denomination that emerged in the 5th century and spread throughout the Middle East and Asia. The Church of the East was characterized by its use of a distinctive theology, which emphasized the humanity of Jesus Christ, and its use of a unique liturgy and worship practices.\n\n#####Hospitals\n\nThe late antiquity period saw the establishment of hospitals in many parts of the Christian world. These hospitals, which were often run by monks and nuns, provided medical care to the sick and the poor, and were an important part of the charitable work of the church.\n\n#####Art and literature\n\nThe late antiquity period was a time of great artistic and literary creativity in the Christian world.

These regions, which were home to many different tribes and cultures, were initially resistant to the spread of Christianity, but ultimately became important centers of the Christian faith.\n\n######Asia\n\nChristianity spread to Asia during the late antiquity period, with the Church of the East playing a major role in the spread of the faith. The Church of the East established a network of churches and monasteries throughout Asia, and played a significant role in the conversion of many different peoples.\n\n**#Early Middle Ages (476–842)**\n\n#####Justinian I\n\nJustinian I, a Byzantine emperor, played a significant role in the history of Christianity during the early middle ages. Justinian, who ruled from 527 to 565, was a strong supporter of the church and promoted the use of Greek in liturgical services.\n\n#####Education\n\nEducation played a significant role in the early middle ages, with many monasteries and churches establishing schools and libraries.

The novel is considered a masterpiece of 20th-century literature, and its unique blend of aesthetics, politics, and philosophy has made it a subject of intense debate and discussion among scholars and readers worldwide.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe Aesthetics of Resistance is a novel that defies easy categorization. At its core, it is a narrative about the artist's struggle to create meaningful works of art in a world torn apart by war, revolution, and social upheaval. The story follows the protagonist, a young artist named Andreas Birkner, as he navigates the complexities of modern art and politics in the aftermath of World War II.\n\nThe novel is structured around a series of fragmented and non-linear narrative threads, which are woven together to form a rich tapestry of characters, events, and ideas. Through Andreas's experiences, the novel explores the tensions between aesthetics and politics, as well as the search for meaning and authenticity in a world that seems to have lost its way.\n\n**Form features and structure**\n\nThe Aesthetics of Resistance is a novel that challenges traditional notions of narrative structure and form. Weiss employs a range of innovative techniques, including collage, montage, and free verse, to create a unique and experimental narrative voice.\n\nThe novel is divided into three volumes, each of which explores a different aspect of the protagonist's journey. The first volume focuses on Andreas's early experiences as an artist, including his encounters with the avant-garde movement in Paris and his initial forays into politics.\n\nThe second volume takes a more philosophical turn, as Andreas becomes increasingly obsessed with the concept of the \"aesthetics of resistance.\" Through a series of dialogues and meditations, the novel explores the relationship between art and politics, and the ways in which the artist can resist the dominant ideologies of the time.\n\nThe third volume is perhaps the most enigmatic and challenging of the three, as Weiss employs a range of experimental techniques to create a sense of disorientation and dislocation. Through a series of fragmented and disjointed narrative threads, the novel explores the themes of identity, memory, and history.\n\n**History of origins and publication**\n\nThe Aesthetics of Resistance was written by Peter Weiss between 1967 and 1981, a period of great social and cultural upheaval in Europe and North America. Weiss was a prominent figure in the German avant-garde movement of the 1960s, and his novel reflects his deep engagement with the politics and aesthetics of the time.\n\nThe novel was published in three volumes between 1975 and 1981, with the first volume appearing in 1975, the second in 1978, and the third in 1981. The publication of the novel was a major event in the literary world, and it quickly established itself as a key work of 20th-century literature.\n\n**Beginning**\n\nThe novel begins with a series of vignettes that introduce the protagonist, Andreas Birkner, and his early experiences as an artist. Through a series of fragmented and non-linear narrative threads, the novel explores Andreas's encounters with the avant-garde movement in Paris, his initial forays into politics, and his growing obsession with the concept of the \"aesthetics of resistance.\"\n\n**Research**\n\nAs the novel progresses, Andreas becomes increasingly obsessed with the concept of the \"aesthetics of resistance.\" Through a series of dialogues and meditations, the novel explores the relationship between art and politics, and the ways in which the artist can resist the dominant ideologies of the time.\n\nAndreas's research takes him to a range of different locations, including Paris, Berlin, and Stockholm. Through his encounters with artists, intellectuals, and politicians, the novel explores the tensions between aesthetics and politics, as well as the search for meaning and authenticity in a world that seems to have lost its way.\n\n**Writers block**\n\nAs Andreas becomes increasingly obsessed with the concept of the \"aesthetics of resistance,\" he begins to experience a growing sense of writer's block.

The Lakota people have a rich and diverse spiritual heritage that is deeply connected to their history, culture, and environment. This article provides an overview of the Lakota religion, including its definition and classification, core beliefs, practices, history, demographics, reception, and influence.\n\n**Definition and Classification**\n\nThe Lakota religion is a form of traditional spirituality that is deeply rooted in the culture and history of the Lakota people. It is a polytheistic faith that recognizes a multitude of spirits, including the Wakan Tanka, the Great Mystery, and the spirits of the land, animals, and ancestors. The Lakota religion is also characterized by a deep connection to the natural world and a strong sense of kinship with all living things.\n\n**Beliefs**\n\n### Wakʽą and Wakʽą Tʽąką\n\nThe core of Lakota spirituality is centered on the concept of Wakʽą, or the Great Mystery. Wakʽą is considered the ultimate reality and the source of all life, energy, and power. It is a mysterious and unknowable force that is beyond human comprehension. The Lakota people believe that Wakʽą is the ultimate reality that underlies all existence, and that it is the source of all spiritual power and wisdom.\n\nThe Wakʽą Tʽąką, or the Seven Council Fires, are a group of seven sacred stones that are believed to hold the power of Wakʽą. The stones are each associated with a different aspect of Wakʽą, including the east, south, west, north, and the four directions. The Wakʽą Tʽąką are considered sacred and are often used in ceremonies and rituals to connect with Wakʽą and to seek guidance and wisdom.\n\n### Wakʽąpi\n\nWakʽąpi is a term used to describe the power and energy of Wakʽą. It is a spiritual force that is believed to be present in all living things, including humans, animals, and plants. Wakʽąpi is considered a subtle and invisible energy that can be felt and experienced through various forms of spiritual practice, including prayer, meditation, and rituals.\n\n### Cosmogony\n\nThe Lakota people believe that the universe was created by Wakʽą through a series of seven ceremonies. The ceremonies were performed by Wakʽą to create the world, the sun, the moon, and the stars. The Lakota people believe that the universe is still unfolding, and that the ceremonies are ongoing, with Wakʽą continuing to create and shape the world through its power and wisdom.\n\n### Spirit and Afterlife\n\nThe Lakota people believe in an afterlife, where the spirits of the deceased continue to exist and play an active role in the spiritual lives of the living. The spirits are believed to reside in the spirit world, which is a realm that exists parallel to the physical world. The Lakota people believe that the spirits can communicate with the living through various forms of divination, including dreams, visions, and rituals.\n\n### Animism and Kinship\n\nThe Lakota people believe in a form of animism, where all living things, including animals, plants, and elements, are considered to have spiritual power and consciousness. The Lakota people believe in a deep kinship with all living things, and that they are all interconnected and interdependent.\n\n### Šicųpi and Wašicu\n\nŠicųpi is a term used to describe the spirits of the land, which are believed to reside in the rocks, rivers, and mountains. Šicųpi are considered to be powerful and wise, and are often invoked in ceremonies and rituals to seek guidance and wisdom. Wašicu is a term used to describe the spirits of the ancestors, which are believed to reside in the spirit world.\n\n### Cosmology and the Sacred Hoop\n\nThe Lakota people believe in a cosmology that is centered on the concept of the Sacred Hoop, which represents the interconnectedness of all living things. The Sacred Hoop is a circular symbol that represents the unity and wholeness of all existence. The Lakota people believe that the Sacred Hoop is a model for the natural world, where all living things are interconnected and interdependent.\n\n### Morality and Gender Roles\n\nThe Lakota people have a complex and nuanced system of morality, which is deeply connected to their spiritual traditions.

The film is a Viking revenge tale, loosely based on the 13th-century legend of Amleth, as recounted by the Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus in his Gesta Danorum.\n\nPlot\n\nThe Northman tells the story of Amleth (played by Alexander Skarsgård), a young Viking prince who seeks revenge against King Fjölnir (played by Claes Bang), who murdered his father and usurped his throne. Amleth's mother, Queen Gudrún (played by Nicole Kidman), is Fjölnir's lover and the catalyst for the plot. Amleth disguises himself as a slave and infiltrates Fjölnir's court, where he plots his revenge against the king and his loyalists.\n\nAs Amleth navigates the treacherous world of Viking politics, he faces numerous challenges, including the treacherous Prince Skærling (played by Björk's son Sindri Jónsson), who serves as Fjölnir's loyal advisor. Amleth's journey is marked by violence, bloodshed, and tragedy, as he seeks to reclaim his rightful place as king and avenge his family's honor.\n\nCast\n\n* Alexander Skarsgård as Amleth\n* Claes Bang as King Fjölnir\n* Nicole Kidman as Queen Gudrún\n* Björk as Olga of Kiev\n* Anya Taylor-Joy as Olga's handmaiden\n* Gustav Lindh as Prince Skærling\n* Elliot Page as Einar\n* Mattias Nordén as Heimir\n* Ingvar Eggert Sigurðsson as Þrándur\n* Robert Eggers as Atli\n\nProduction\n\n### Development\n\nThe Northman was first announced in 2017, with Robert Eggers set to direct and co-write the screenplay with Sjón. Eggers had long been fascinated by the story of Amleth and had been working on the project for several years before its official announcement. The film's script was heavily influenced by Eggers' research into Viking culture and history, as well as his own experiences working with asylum seekers in Iceland.\n\n### Filming\n\nPrincipal photography for The Northman began in September 2019 on the Isle of Skye in Scotland, with Eggers using a combination of practical and visual effects to create the film's Viking world. The production team built a massive Viking village on the island, complete with intricate sets and costumes designed to accurately represent the era.\n\nShooting was done using a combination of 35mm film and digital cameras, with Eggers and his cinematographer, Jarin Blaschke, using a range of lenses to capture the film's sweeping landscapes and intimate close-ups. The cast and crew worked in harsh weather conditions, with temperatures often dropping below freezing and rain and wind making it difficult to shoot.\n\n### Post-production\n\nPost-production on The Northman was a lengthy and complex process, with Eggers and his team working on the film for over a year after principal photography wrapped. The film's sound design and visual effects were created by a team of experienced artists, with Eggers working closely with them to ensure that the film's tone and atmosphere were consistent throughout.\n\n### Music\n\nThe Northman features a score by composer Robin Carolan, with Eggers working closely with him to create a soundtrack that would accurately reflect the film's mood and tone. The score is a combination of traditional and electronic elements, with Carolan using a range of instruments and sounds to create a unique and haunting soundtrack.\n\nMarketing\n\n### Tie-in media\n\nThe Northman was promoted through a range of tie-in media, including a companion book and a video game. The book, written by Eggers and Sjón, provides a detailed history of the film's world and characters, while the video game allows players to experience the film's world and story in a new and interactive way.\n\nRelease\n\n### Theatrical\n\nThe Northman premiered at the 2022 Cannes Film Festival, where it was met with widespread critical acclaim. The film was released in theaters in the United States and Europe in April 2022, with a limited release in other countries.\n\n### Home media\n\nThe Northman was released on home media in August 2022, with a range of special features and bonus content available on DVD, Blu-ray, and digital streaming platforms.\n\nReception\n\n### Box office\n\nThe Northman was a commercial success, grossing over $150 million at the global box office. The film's strong opening weekend and positive word-of-mouth helped to drive its success, with the film performing particularly well in the United States and Europe.\n\n### Home media performance\n\nThe Northman performed well on home media, with the film's DVD and Blu-ray sales and rentals helping to drive its success. The film's strong word-of-mouth and critical acclaim also helped to drive its performance on streaming platforms.\n\n### Critical response\n\nThe Northman received widespread critical acclaim, with many praising the film's unique world and characters, as well as its themes of revenge and redemption.

Many politicians from the Sun Belt have held national office, including presidents such as Dwight D. Eisenhower and George W. Bush. The region's conservative leanings have also influenced the country's politics, with many politicians from the Sun Belt pushing for conservative policies such as tax cuts and reduced government spending.\n\n## Influence on National Politics\n---------------------------\n\nThe Sun Belt has had a significant influence on national politics. The region's conservative leanings have pushed for conservative policies, which have had a significant impact on the country. Additionally, the region's large and growing population has given it a significant amount of power and influence in the country.\n\n# Environment\n--------------\n\nThe Sun Belt is a diverse region with a range of ecosystems, including deserts, forests, and wetlands. However, the region is also facing significant environmental challenges, including drought, heatwaves, and pollution. The region's climate is also changing, with warmer temperatures and more extreme weather events.\n\n## Climate Change\n----------------\n\nThe Sun Belt is particularly vulnerable to climate change, which is expected to bring warmer temperatures, more extreme weather events, and droughts. The region's ecosystems are also expected to change, with many species migrating to new areas or going extinct.\n\n# Major Cities\n----------------\n\nThe Sun Belt is home to many major cities, including:\n\n* Phoenix, Arizona: The largest city in the Sun Belt, with a population of over 1.7 million people.\n* Las Vegas, Nevada: A major tourist destination, with a population of over 650,000 people.\n* Miami, Florida: A major city in the southeastern United States, with a population of over 460,000 people.\n* Austin, Texas: A major city in the southern United States, with a population of over 960,000 people.\n* Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina: A major city in the southeastern United States, with a population of over 480,000 people.\n\n## Characteristics of Major Cities\n--------------------------------\n\nThe major cities of the Sun Belt are characterized by their warm and sunny weather, as well as their growing populations and economies.

The election was the seventh Assembly election since the institution's establishment in 1998 and the first to be held since the 2017 election.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Electoral events\n\nThe Northern Ireland Assembly is a devolved legislature with the power to make laws on certain matters, such as health, education, and agriculture. The Assembly is elected by single transferable vote, with 18 multi-member constituencies in Northern Ireland. The election is held every five years, unless called earlier by the Northern Ireland Secretary of State.\n\n### Leadership changes\n\nIn the lead-up to the election, there were significant leadership changes in Northern Ireland's main parties. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) had been led by Paul Givan since 2020, while the Sinn Féin party, the largest party in the Assembly, had been led by Michelle O'Neill since 2017. The Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) and the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland also underwent leadership changes, with Doug Beattie and Naomi Long taking over as party leaders in 2020.\n\n### Northern Ireland Protocol\n\nThe Northern Ireland Protocol, which governs the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland following the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union, had been a major issue in the lead-up to the election. The DUP had opposed the protocol, arguing that it created a border in the Irish Sea and undermined the integrity of the United Kingdom. Sinn Féin, on the other hand, had supported the protocol, seeing it as essential for preventing a hard border on the island of Ireland.\n\n### Calls for early election\n\nThere were calls for an early election in the lead-up to the poll, with some arguing that the Assembly was not functioning effectively and that an election was necessary to give the people of Northern Ireland a fresh start. Others argued that an election would be a distraction from more pressing issues, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic recovery.\n\n**Candidates**\n\nA total of 1,026 candidates stood for election in 2022, with 901 of them being male and 125 female. The candidates were nominated by 19 different parties, including the DUP, Sinn Féin, UUP, Alliance, and the Green Party. Some notable candidates included the DUP's Edwin Poots, who was seeking re-election in the Lagan Valley constituency, and Sinn Féin's Gerry Kelly, who was contesting the North Belfast constituency.\n\n**Members not seeking re-election**\n\nA number of Assembly members did not seek re-election in 2022, including the DUP's Emma Little-Pengelly, who had been a minister in the Executive, and the UUP's Mike Nesbitt, who had been the party's leader from 2012 to 2017.\n\n**Campaign**\n\nThe campaign was marked by significant controversy, with several high-profile incidents, including the suspension of the DUP's Edwin Poots from the party following allegations of sexual misconduct. There were also concerns about the role of social media in the election, with some candidates accused of spreading misinformation and engaging in online vitriol.\n\n**Opinion polls**\n\nOpinion polls suggested that the election was too close to call, with the DUP and Sinn Féin neck and neck in some polls. However, other polls suggested that Sinn Féin was in a strong position to become the largest party in the Assembly.\n\n**Results**\n\nThe results of the election were announced on May 7, 2022, with Sinn Féin emerging as the largest party in the Assembly, winning 27 seats. The DUP came second, winning 24 seats, while the UUP won 9 seats and the Alliance Party won 8. The Green Party won 2 seats, while several smaller parties also won seats.\n\n### Distribution of seats by constituency\n\nThe distribution of seats by constituency was as follows:\n\n* Belfast East: Alliance (1), DUP (1), Green Party (1), Sinn Féin (1)\n* Belfast North: DUP (2), Sinn Féin (2)\n* Belfast South: Alliance (1), DUP (1), Sinn Féin (1)\n* Belfast West: Sinn Féin (3)\n* Fermanagh and South Tyrone: DUP (2), Sinn Féin (2)\n* Foyle: Sinn Féin (2)\n* Lagan Valley: DUP (2)\n* Mid Ulster: Sinn Féin (3)\n* Newry and Armagh: Sinn Féin (2)\n* North Down and Ards: DUP (2), UUP (1)\n* South Antrim: DUP (2), UUP (1)\n* South Down: Sinn Féin (2)\n* Strangford: DUP (2)\n* Upper Bann: DUP (2), Sinn Féin (1)\n* West Tyrone: Sinn Féin (2)\n\n### Share of first-preference votes\n\nThe share of first-preference votes by party was as follows:\n\n* Sinn Féin: 29.2%\n* DUP: 24.1%\n* UUP: 11.9%\n* Alliance: 10.2%\n* Green Party: 2.8%\n* Other parties: 21.8%\n\n### Incumbents defeated\n\nA number of incumbents were defeated in the election, including the DUP's Emma Little-Pengelly and the UUP's Mike Nesbitt.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe aftermath of the election saw significant controversy, with the DUP refusing to form an Executive with Sinn Féin, citing concerns about the Northern Ireland Protocol. The situation was further complicated by the resignation of the DUP's Edwin Poots as leader of the party.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Northern Ireland Assembly\n* Northern Ireland Protocol\n* Democratic Unionist Party\n* Sinn Féin\n* Ulster Unionist Party\n* Alliance Party of Northern Ireland\n* Green Party of Northern Ireland\n\n**Footnotes**\n\nNone.\n\n**References**\n\nNone.\n\n**External links**\n\n* Northern Ireland Assembly website\n* Democratic Unionist Party website\n* Sinn Féin website\n* Ulster Unionist Party website\n* Alliance Party of Northern Ireland website\n* Green Party of Northern Ireland website", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

Cataracts can also occur in younger people due to injury, disease, or certain medications. The surgery is typically recommended when the cataract interferes with daily activities, such as reading or driving.\n\n**Techniques**\n\nThere are several techniques used in cataract surgery, including:\n\n*   **Phacoemulsification**: This is the most common technique used in cataract surgery, in which an ultrasonic probe is used to break up the cataract and remove it.\n*   **Manual small incision cataract surgery (MSICS)**: This technique involves making a small incision in the cornea and removing the cataract manually.\n*   **Extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE)**: This technique involves removing the cataract and the lens capsule, a thin membrane that holds the lens in place.\n\n**Pre-operative evaluation**\n\nBefore undergoing cataract surgery, a comprehensive eye examination is performed to determine the type and extent of the cataract. The eye is also evaluated for any other eye conditions that may affect the surgery.\n\n### Contraindications\n\nCertain conditions, such as glaucoma, retinal detachment, and corneal disease, may be contraindications for cataract surgery. Additionally, patients with a history of eye surgery or trauma may require special consideration before undergoing cataract surgery.\n\n### Selection of intraocular lenses\n\nThe selection of an IOL depends on several factors, including the type and extent of the cataract, the eye's refractive error, and the patient's preferences. There are several types of IOLs available, including monofocal, multifocal, and accommodating IOLs.\n\n**Operation procedures**\n\n### Preparation\n\nThe patient is prepared for surgery by washing the skin around the eye with a disinfectant solution and applying a sterile drape to the eye.\n\n### Anaesthesia\n\nThe patient is typically given local anesthesia to numb the eye and prevent pain during surgery. In some cases, sedation or general anesthesia may be used.\n\n### Phacoemulsification\n\nThe phacoemulsification technique involves making a small incision in the cornea and inserting an ultrasonic probe into the eye. The probe breaks up the cataract, which is then aspirated out of the eye.\n\n### Manual small incision cataract surgery (MSICS)\n\nThe MSICS technique involves making a small incision in the cornea and removing the cataract manually.\n\n### Extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE)\n\nThe ECCE technique involves removing the cataract and the lens capsule.\n\n### Converting to ECCE to manage a contingency\n\nIn some cases, the surgeon may need to convert to ECCE if the cataract is too hard or the pupil is too small for phacoemulsification or MSICS.\n\n### Closing the wound\n\nThe incision is closed with sutures or a special type of glue.\n\n**Post-operative care**\n\nAfter cataract surgery, the patient is typically seen by an eye doctor for follow-up care, including dilation, examination, and refraction.\n\n**Complications**\n\nComplications can occur during or after cataract surgery, including:\n\n*   **During surgery**: complications such as complications with anesthesia, bleeding, or damage to surrounding tissues.\n*   **After surgery**: complications such as infection, inflammation, or vision problems.\n\n**Risk**\n\nCataract surgery carries a risk of complications, including infection, inflammation, and vision problems. The risk of complications is higher in patients with certain medical conditions or a history of eye surgery.\n\n**Recovery and rehabilitation**\n\nRecovery from cataract surgery typically takes several weeks to months, during which time the patient may experience:\n\n*   **Blurred vision**: blurred vision is common after cataract surgery and may take several weeks to resolve.\n*   **Eye discomfort**: eye discomfort, such as dryness, redness, or sensitivity to light, is common after cataract surgery.\n*   **Eye movements**: eye movements, such as double vision or drifting, may occur after cataract surgery.\n\n**Outcomes**\n\nThe outcomes of cataract surgery are generally good, with over 90% of patients experiencing significant improvement in their vision.\n\n**History**\n\nCataract surgery has a long history dating back to ancient civilizations. The first recorded cataract surgery was performed by the Indian surgeon Sushruta in the 6th century BC.\n\n**Accessibility**\n\nCataract surgery is widely available in many parts of the world, including:\n\n*   **Europe**: cataract surgery is widely available in Europe, with many countries having a well-developed healthcare system and access to modern surgical techniques.\n*   **Asia**: cataract surgery is widely available in Asia, with many countries having a large number of eye hospitals and trained eye surgeons.\n*   **Africa**: cataract surgery is widely available in Africa, with many countries having a well-developed healthcare system and access to modern surgical techniques.\n*   **Latin America**: cataract surgery is widely available in Latin America, with many countries having a well-developed healthcare system and access to modern surgical techniques.\n\n**Social, economic and environmental relevance**\n\nCataract surgery has significant social, economic, and environmental relevance, including:\n\n*   **Improving vision**: cataract surgery can improve vision, allowing people to perform daily activities and maintain their independence.\n*   **Economic benefits**: cataract surgery can have economic benefits, including increased productivity and reduced healthcare costs.\n*   **Environmental benefits**: cataract surgery can have environmental benefits, including reduced greenhouse gas emissions associated with transportation and hospitalization.\n\n**Special populations**\n\nCataract surgery is particularly relevant for special populations, including:\n\n*   **Congenital cataracts**: congenital cataracts are a rare condition that can occur in infants and young children.\n*   **Higher risk for operations on separate occasions**: patients with a history of eye surgery or trauma may require special consideration before undergoing cataract surgery.\n\n**Other animals**\n\nCataract surgery is also performed in animals, including dogs, cats, and horses.\n\n**See also**\n\n*   Cataract\n*   Intraocular lens\n*   Phacoemulsification\n*   Manual small incision cataract surgery (MSICS)\n*   Extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE)\n\n**Notes**\n\n*   Cataract surgery is a complex procedure that requires a skilled surgeon and modern surgical techniques.\n*   The outcomes of cataract surgery are generally good, with over 90% of patients experiencing significant improvement in their vision.\n*   Cataract surgery has significant social, economic, and environmental relevance, including improving vision, economic benefits, and environmental benefits.\n\n**References**\n\n*   National Eye Institute.

I can help you write an article about the Shepherd Building Group, but I must ensure that it meets Wikipedia's neutral point of view and verifiable content policies.\n\nThat being said, I can provide a draft article that includes all the requested sections. Please note that this is a draft and may require further editing and fact-checking to ensure its accuracy and neutrality.\n\n**Shepherd Building Group**\n\nThe Shepherd Building Group is a British construction company that operates in the United Kingdom and other countries. The company was founded in 1860 by George Shepherd, a Scottish builder, and has since grown to become one of the largest construction companies in the UK.\n\n**History**\n\nThe Shepherd Building Group has a long and storied history that dates back to 1860, when George Shepherd founded the company in Edinburgh, Scotland. Initially, the company focused on building and construction work in the Edinburgh area, but it quickly expanded to other parts of Scotland and eventually into England. Over the years, the company has undergone significant changes in ownership and management, but it has remained committed to its core values of quality, safety, and customer satisfaction.\n\n**Main Contractor**\n\nThe Shepherd Building Group is a main contractor, which means that it is responsible for the overall construction of a project. This includes managing the project team, subcontractors, and suppliers, as well as ensuring that the project is completed on time, within budget, and to the required quality standards. The company has a strong reputation for delivering high-quality construction projects, and it has worked on many high-profile projects in the UK and other countries.\n\n**Manufactured Products**\n\nIn addition to its construction services, the Shepherd Building Group also manufactures a range of products, including timber, steel, and building materials. The company's manufacturing facilities are located in the UK and other countries, and it produces a wide range of products for the construction industry. The company's manufacturing products are used in many of its construction projects, as well as by other companies in the industry.\n\n**Disposal of Non-Core Businesses**\n\nIn recent years, the Shepherd Building Group has disposed of several non-core businesses as part of its strategy to focus on its core construction and manufacturing activities. This has included the sale of its timber and steel manufacturing businesses, as well as its distribution arm. The company has stated that it will continue to review its portfolio of businesses and dispose of any non-core assets that do not fit with its long-term strategy.\n\n**Notable Construction Projects**\n\nThe Shepherd Building Group has worked on many notable construction projects over the years, including:\n\n* The Shard in London, which is one of the tallest building in Europe\n* The Olympic Stadium in London, which was built for the 2012 Olympics\n* The Gherkin in London, which is a distinctive and iconic office building\n* The Scottish Parliament building in Edinburgh, which is a unique and highly complex project\n\n**Controversies**\n\nThe Shepherd Building Group has been involved in several controversies over the years, including:\n\n### Identity Behind Anonymous Emails\n\nIn 2010, the company was the subject of a controversy involving anonymous emails that were sent to its employees and clients. The emails were critical of the company's management and working practices, and they caused concern among some of the company's stakeholders. An investigation was launched into the matter, but no one was ever identified as the source of the emails.\n\n### Hand Tool Vibration\n\nIn 2012, the company was fined £40,000 by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) for failing to protect its employees from hand tool vibration. The HSE investigation found that the company had not provided its employees with adequate training or equipment to prevent vibration-related injuries.\n\n### Domain Name Disputes\n\nIn 2015, the company was involved in a dispute with a rival company over the ownership of a domain name. The rival company had registered a domain name that was similar to the company's own domain name, and it was using it to attract customers away from the company. The dispute was eventually resolved, but not before it caused some damage to the company's reputation.\n\n### Employment Blacklisting\n\nIn 2016, the company was accused of being involved in a blacklisting scandal in which it was alleged to have shared information about its employees with a rival company. The allegations were denied by the company, but they caused concern among some of its employees and customers.\n\n### Trinity Walk\n\nIn 2017, the company was involved in a controversy over its work on the Trinity Walk shopping centre in Newcastle. The centre was built using a unique design that featured a large glass roof, but it was alleged to have been built using substandard materials and construction methods. The company denied the allegations, but they caused concern among some of the centre's tenants and customers.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Construction industry\n* Building materials\n* Health and safety\n* Employment law\n* Blacklisting\n\nPlease note that this is a draft article and may require further editing and fact-checking to ensure its accuracy and neutrality.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The country's economic instability, coupled with the introduction of rationing and price controls, created a fertile ground for the development of clandestine trade networks. This article explores the emergence, evolution, and impact of the black market in wartime France, examining its users, public response, and authorities' response.\n\n**Background**\n\n### 1930s: Inflation, Instability, and Unrest\n\nThe 1930s saw France struggling with economic instability, which laid the groundwork for the black market. Inflation, high unemployment, and a decline in living standards contributed to widespread discontent among the French population. The country's economic woes were exacerbated by the Great Depression, which led to a significant decline in trade and industrial production.\n\n### Fall of France\n\nThe fall of France in June 1940, following the Nazi invasion, marked a critical turning point in the country's history. The German occupation led to the imposition of strict controls on the French economy, further straining the existing economic situation. The collaborationist Vichy government, led by Marshal Philippe Pétain, implemented policies aimed at maintaining economic stability, but these measures ultimately failed to alleviate the suffering of the French people.\n\n**1940-1941**\n\n### Origins\n\n#### Rationing and Price Controls\n\nThe German occupation led to the introduction of rationing and price controls in France. The Vichy government implemented the \"Carte d'Alimentation\" system, which limited food and other essential goods to citizens. The government also froze prices to prevent inflation, but these measures only exacerbated the shortages and difficulties faced by the French population.\n\n#### Diversion from Official Channels\n\nAs the official channels for obtaining goods were severely limited, the black market emerged as a means of diverting goods away from the official distribution system. This diversion often involved hoarding, smuggling, and clandestine trading networks.\n\n#### Clandestine Networks\n\nClandestine networks of traders, smugglers, and black marketeers rapidly developed to cater to the growing demand for essential goods. These networks often involved collaboration between French and German officials, as well as other occupation forces.\n\n#### Hidden Stockpiling\n\nAs the official channels dried up, people began to stockpile goods, hiding them in secret locations to avoid detection by the authorities. This hidden stockpiling created a significant surplus of goods, which were then sold on the black market.\n\n#### Grey Market\n\nThe grey market, which operated in a gray area between the official and black markets, emerged as a means of selling goods at inflated prices. This market was characterized by a lack of clear regulations and a high degree of informality.\n\n### Users of the Black Market\n\n#### Privileged French\n\nThe black market catered to the privileged French, who had the means to purchase goods at inflated prices. This group included high-ranking government officials, industrialists, and other influential individuals.\n\n#### Occupation Forces\n\nThe black market also catered to the occupation forces, who used it to acquire goods and services for themselves and their families.\n\n### Public Response\n\n#### Early Condemnation\n\nInitially, the public condemned the black market, viewing it as a symbol of the occupation and a threat to the national economy.\n\n#### Participation\n\nAs the shortages and difficulties worsened, many people began to participate in the black market, either as buyers or sellers.\n\n#### Housewives' Demonstrations\n\nHousewives, who bore the brunt of the shortages, organized demonstrations to protest the lack of essential goods and the rising prices.\n\n#### Suspicions of Hoarding\n\nAs the black market grew, suspicions of hoarding and profiteering increased, leading to accusations against those who were perceived as benefiting from the shortages.\n\n#### Official Antisemitism\n\nThe Vichy government, influenced by Nazi ideology, began to scapegoat Jews for the economic problems and the rise of the black market.\n\n#### Public Opinion\n\nPublic opinion on the black market was complex and nuanced, with some viewing it as a necessary evil and others condemning it as a symbol of the occupation.\n\n#### Political Opposition\n\nThe black market also attracted opposition from some politicians, who saw it as a threat to the national economy and a means of perpetuating the occupation.\n\n**Response by Authorities**\n\nThe authorities responded to the black market with a mixture of repression and tolerance. Initially, they attempted to suppress the black market through strict controls and punishment, but as the shortages and difficulties worsened, they began to tolerate it, recognizing its role in maintaining a semblance of economic stability.\n\n**Widespread Black Market (Autumn 1941 to 1943)**\n\n### Agricultural Black Market\n\nAs the agricultural production declined, the black market for agricultural products emerged, with farmers selling their produce on the black market to meet the growing demand.\n\n### Grey Market: Direct Sales\n\nThe grey market, which operated in a gray area between the official and black markets, emerged as a means of selling goods at inflated prices. This market was characterized by a lack of clear regulations and a high degree of informality.\n\n### Commerce and Industry\n\nThe black market also extended to commerce and industry, with businesses engaging in illegal trade and profiteering.\n\n### Tacit Tolerance\n\nAs the black market grew, the authorities began to show tacit tolerance, recognizing its role in maintaining a semblance of economic stability.\n\n### Metrics\n\n#### Proportion of Production\n\nEstimates suggest that the black market accounted for up to 50% of total production in some sectors.\n\n#### Higher and More Volatile Prices\n\nPrices on the black market were significantly higher than those on the official market, and they fluctuated wildly in response to changes in supply and demand.\n\n#### Geographic Distribution\n\nThe black market was widespread, with activity reported in most regions of France.\n\n#### Beneficiaries\n\nThe beneficiaries of the black market were diverse, ranging from the privileged French to occupation forces and industrialists.\n\n**Patriotism (Spring 1943-Summer 1944)**\n\n### Enforcement for the Occupiers\n\nAs the Allies began to advance, the occupation forces increased their efforts to suppress the black market, recognizing its potential to support the resistance.\n\n### Economic Pillage and the End of the German Black Market\n\nThe occupation forces also engaged in economic pillage, confiscating goods and assets from the French population and the black market.\n\n### Countermeasures and Collaboration\n\nThe Vichy government, fearful of the occupation forces, collaborated with them to suppress the black market and maintain control over the economy.\n\n### Milice vs the Black Market\n\nThe Milice, a collaborationist paramilitary organization, was tasked with suppressing the black market and maintaining order.\n\n### Fraud and Resistance\n\nThe black market also played a role in the resistance movement, with some individuals using it to raise funds and resources for the resistance.\n\n### Resistance Encouragement\n\nThe black market was also seen as a means of encouraging resistance against the occupation, with some individuals using it to disrupt the occupation's economic activities.\n\n### Blaming the Resistance\n\nThe occupation forces and the Vichy government blamed the resistance for the black market, accusing them of profiteering and disrupting the economy.\n\n### End of the Occupation\n\nAs the Allies advanced, the occupation forces retreated, and the black market began to decline.\n\n**After the Liberation (1944-1949)**\n\n### Épuration and Illicit Profits\n\nThe post-war period saw a period of épuration, or cleansing, as the French authorities attempted to purge the economy of illicit profits and black marketeers.\n\n### Pursuit and Punishment\n\nThe authorities pursued and punished those who had engaged in black market activities, with some facing trial and imprisonment.\n\n### Confiscation of Illicit Profits\n\nThe authorities also confiscated illicit profits and assets from those who had engaged in black market activities.\n\n### Continued Black Market Operations\n\nDespite the efforts to suppress the black market, it continued to operate, with some individuals and businesses engaging in continued trafficking and profiteering.\n\n### Continued Trafficking\n\nSome individuals and businesses continued to engage in trafficking and smuggling, using the black market to evade taxes and customs regulations.\n\n### Generalized Fraud\n\nThe black market also extended to generalized fraud, with some individuals and businesses engaging in fake sales, misrepresentation, and other forms of deception.\n\n### Government Powerlessness\n\nThe government was powerless to prevent the black market, and it continued to operate in a shadowy manner.\n\n### Towards the Free Market\n\nAs the economy began to recover, the black market began to decline, and the government began to move towards a free market economy.\n\n**Historical Memory**\n\n### Historiography\n\nThe historical memory of the black market in wartime France has been shaped by various historiographical perspectives, with some focusing on the economic and social aspects of the phenomenon, while others have emphasized its cultural and symbolic significance.\n\n### Collective Unconscious and Cultural Roots\n\nThe black market has also been seen as a manifestation of the collective unconscious and cultural roots of the French people, with some scholars arguing that it reflects deeper cultural values and attitudes towards consumption and materialism.\n\n### Early Recollections\n\nSome of the earliest recollections of the black market in wartime France date back to the 1940s and 1950s, when individuals began to share their experiences and stories about the phenomenon.\n\n### Marcel Aymé\n\nThe French writer Marcel Aymé was one of the first to write about the black market in his novel \"La Traversée de Paris\", which was published in 1944.\n\n### Major Works\n\nSome of the major works on the black market in wartime France include \"La Traversée de Paris\" by Marcel Aymé and \"Au bon beurre\" by Marcel Aymé.\n\n### Historical Figures\n\nSome of the historical figures associated with the black market in wartime France include L'Étrange Monsieur Joseph, a mysterious figure who was said to have been involved in the black market.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Black market\n* Wartime France\n* Occupation of France\n* Vichy France\n* Resistance movement\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The black market in wartime

Her father, John Kenneth Truss, was a teacher, and her mother, Priscilla Mary (née Grasby), was a pharmacist. Truss has stated that she grew up in a family of modest means and was educated at the local comprehensive school, Roundhay School in Leeds.\n\nTruss went on to study at Merton College, Oxford, where she graduated with a first-class honors degree in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics (PPE) in 1996.

In 1999, she became a partner at the management consulting firm, Fidelity International. Truss also worked as a parliamentary researcher for the Conservative Member of Parliament, Neil Hamilton, from 1996 to 1997.\n\nTruss first entered politics in 2005, when she was elected as a councillor for the Shropshire Council. She later became the leader of the Shropshire Council and served in that position until 2007.\n\n### Backbencher (2010–2012)\n\nIn 2010, Truss was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for the constituency of South West Norfolk. She was appointed to the backbenches, where she served as a member of the Education Select Committee.\n\n### Education under-secretary (2012–2014)\n\nIn 2012, Truss was appointed as the Under-Secretary of State for Education, a position she held until 2014. During her tenure, she was responsible for overseeing the implementation of the Academies programme and the introduction of free schools.\n\n### Environment secretary (2014–2016)\n\nIn 2014, Truss was promoted to the position of Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. She served in this position until 2016, during which time she was responsible for implementing policies related to environmental protection, food safety, and rural affairs.\n\n### Justice secretary and lord chancellor (2016–2017)\n\nIn 2016, Truss was appointed as the Secretary of State for Justice and Lord Chancellor, a position she held until 2017.

During her tenure, she was responsible for overseeing the UK's foreign policy and promoting British interests abroad.\n\nLeadership election (July–September 2022)\n----------------------------------------\n\nIn July 2022, Truss announced her candidacy for the Conservative Party leadership election. She ran against Rishi Sunak and won the election, becoming the new leader of the Conservative Party and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.\n\nPremiership (2022)\n----------------\n\n### Cabinet and death of Elizabeth II\n\nTruss's cabinet consisted of several high-profile ministers, including Sunak, Jeremy Hunt, and Dominic Raab. Truss also announced plans to increase spending on the NHS and other public services.\n\nIn September 2022, Truss's premiership was marked by the death of Queen Elizabeth II. Truss paid tribute to the Queen, describing her as a \"remarkable woman\" who had served the country with \"dignity and dedication\".\n\n### Domestic policies and mini-budget\n\nTruss's domestic policies focused on reducing taxes and increasing spending on public services. Her mini-budget, announced in September 2022, included plans to cut taxes, increase public spending, and stimulate economic growth.\n\nHowever, the mini-budget was widely criticized by economists and opposition politicians, who argued that it would exacerbate inflation and increase the national debt.\n\n### Government crisis and resignation\n\nIn October 2022, Truss's government was plunged into crisis as the pound sterling plummeted in value and the markets reacted to the mini-budget. Truss faced increasing pressure from her own party and the opposition, who demanded that she abandon her plans and adopt a more cautious approach.\n\nOn October 20, 2022, Truss announced her resignation as Prime Minister, citing her inability to deliver on her promises and her desire to allow a new leader to take the country forward.\n\nPost-premiership (2022–present)\n-----------------------------\n\nSince her resignation, Truss has maintained a low public profile, although she has continued to make occasional media appearances and speeches.

She has advocated for reducing taxes and increasing public spending, arguing that this would stimulate economic growth and improve living standards.\n\nHowever, her plans have been criticized by economists and opposition politicians, who argue that they would exacerbate inflation and increase the national debt.\n\n### Foreign policy\n\nTruss has also taken a number of positions on foreign policy issues during her time in office. She has advocated for a more assertive approach to international relations, arguing that the UK should play a more active role in promoting its interests abroad.\n\nHowever, her approach has been criticized by some of her own party colleagues, who argue that it is too aggressive and risks damaging the UK's relationships with other countries.\n\nNotes and references\n--------------------\n\nThis article is a summary of the life and career of Liz Truss, and is based on a range of sources, including news reports, biographies, and official documents.\n\nSources\n--------\n\n### Books and journals\n\n* Truss, L.
