Indiana Jones is in London, where he is working as a professor at the University of London. He is approached by a CIA agent, who informs him that a mysterious artifact known as the \"Dial of Destiny\" has been stolen from a British museum. The Dial is said to have the power to control time itself, and the CIA agent believes that it has fallen into the wrong hands.\n\nIndiana Jones is tasked with finding the Dial and preventing it from falling into the hands of the nefarious Nazi, Jürgen Voller.

This period saw the establishment of the first permanent English settlements in the region, and the architecture that emerged during this time reflects the needs and values of the early colonists.\n\n**#Legend**\n\nThe term \"First Period\" was first coined by American architectural historian Abbott Lowell Cummings in the 1950s to describe the unique architectural style of the early colonial period in Massachusetts. Cummings identified 1660 as the starting point for this period, based on the availability of building materials, such as clapboard and brick, and the establishment of the first permanent English settlements in the region. The end date of 1679 marks the transition from the First Period to the Second Period, characterized by the introduction of new architectural styles and the greater availability of materials.\n\n**#1660–1670**\n\nDuring the first decade of the First Period, the early colonists in Massachusetts built houses that were largely influenced by English and Dutch traditions. These houses were typically one-and-a-half stories high, with a central chimney and a gabled roof. The walls were constructed using a combination of wooden framing and clapboard, which provided a durable and weather-resistant exterior. The interior of these houses was often simple and functional, with a central hall and a loft or attic space above.\n\nSome notable examples of First Period houses from this period include:\n\n* The Fairbanks House in Dedham, Massachusetts, which dates back to 1636 but was significantly modified in the 1660s to reflect the First Period style.\n* The Cary House in Hingham, Massachusetts, which features a classic First Period design with a central chimney and a gabled roof.\n* The Francis House in Ipswich, Massachusetts, which showcases a more elaborate First Period design with a gambrel roof and a decorative cornice.\n\n**#1671–1679**\n\nDuring the second decade of the First Period, the architecture of Massachusetts continued to evolve and become more refined. Houses from this period often featured more complex designs, with multiple chimneys and more elaborate rooflines. The use of materials such as brick and stone became more widespread, and the introduction of new building techniques, such as the use of mortise and tenon joints, allowed for greater precision and craftsmanship.\n\nSome notable examples of First Period houses from this period include:\n\n* The James House in Scituate, Massachusetts, which features a classic First Period design with a central chimney and a gambrel roof.\n* The Treat House in Weymouth, Massachusetts, which showcases a more elaborate First Period design with multiple chimneys and a decorative cornice.\n* The Collins House in Milton, Massachusetts, which dates back to 1679 and features a rare example of a First Period house with a brick exterior.\n\n**#See also**\n\n* American colonial architecture\n* English colonial architecture\n* Dutch colonial architecture\n* Puritan architecture\n* Historic houses in Massachusetts\n\n**#Notes**\n\n* The First Period houses in Massachusetts are highly valued for their historical significance and architectural merit.\n* Many of these houses have been restored to their original condition, and some have been converted into museums or historic sites.\n* The First Period houses in Massachusetts provide a unique glimpse into the lives and values of the early colonists.\n\n**#References**\n\n(Note: No references are provided as per the requirements)\n\n**#External links**\n\n* Massachusetts Historical Society: First Period Houses\n* Historic New England: First Period Houses\n* American Society of Architectural Historians: First Period of American Architecture", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

Introduced in October 2023 as a standalone app, Threads allows users to share short messages, called \"threads,\" up to 500 characters in length. This article provides an overview of the app's history, features, user base, and responses to its launch.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThreads is the latest addition to the social media landscape, positioning itself as a platform for short-form, real-time communication. The app has generated considerable interest, with some users hailing it as a \"Twitter killer\" due to its similarities in functionality. However, the app's performance and user reception have been mixed, sparking debates about its potential impact on the social media ecosystem.\n\n**History**\n\n### Predecessor\n\nThreads can be seen as an evolution of Instagram's \"Notes\" feature, which allowed users to share longer, more personal posts. While Notes was primarily used for sharing stories and experiences, Threads takes a more general approach, enabling users to share a wider range of content.\n\n### Development and announcement\n\nThe development of Threads is believed to have begun in 2022, with reports suggesting that the app was initially aimed at the younger demographic. The project was reportedly spearheaded by Instagram's leadership, with the goal of creating a new platform that would complement the existing social media landscape.\n\n### Launch\n\nThreads was officially launched on October 3, 2023, for users in the United States. The app's initial rollout was met with moderate interest, with some users expressing excitement about the potential for more direct communication with their favorite accounts. However, others were skeptical about the app's purpose and functionality.\n\n**Appearance and features**\n\n### Possibility of open interoperability\n\nOne of the key features of Threads is its potential for open interoperability, allowing users to share their content across different platforms. While the app's current iteration focuses on sharing within the Threads community, there are plans to expand its functionality to include cross-platform sharing.\n\n### Account integration with Instagram\n\nThreads allows users to easily share their content to Instagram, leveraging the existing user base and engagement on the platform. This integration is seen as a key feature, enabling users to reach a broader audience and increasing the app's visibility.\n\n### Device compatibility\n\nThreads is available on both iOS and Android devices, ensuring that users across various platforms can access the app. The app's design is optimized for mobile devices, making it easy to use and navigate.\n\n### Censorship attempts\n\nIn its first few weeks of operation, Threads faced criticism for its handling of hate speech and misinformation. The app's moderation policies were questioned, with some users accusing the platform of being too lenient in its approach to content moderation.\n\n### Advertising\n\nThreads has faced criticism for its advertising policies, with some users expressing concerns about the app's reliance on targeted ads. The app's monetization strategy has sparked debates about the potential impact on user experience and online engagement.\n\n**Userbase**\n\n### Decline in the months after launch\n\nAfter its initial launch, Threads faced a decline in user engagement, with some users citing the app's lack of clear purpose and functionality as a reason for its decline. However, the app's popularity in certain regions, such as Taiwan, has helped to offset its decline in other areas.\n\n### Popularity in Taiwan\n\nThreads has gained significant traction in Taiwan, where users have been quick to adopt the app and share their content. The app's popularity in the region has been attributed to its ease of use and the ability to share content with a wide range of audiences.\n\n**Responses**\n\n### Intellectual property dispute\n\nThreads has faced criticism for its handling of intellectual property disputes, with some users accusing the app of failing to adequately address copyright infringement. The app's moderation policies have been questioned, with some users calling for more robust measures to protect creators' rights.\n\n### Data privacy\n\nThe app has faced concerns about data privacy, with some users expressing worries about the app's collection and storage of user data. Threads has responded to these concerns by emphasizing its commitment to protecting user data and ensuring transparency in its data collection practices.\n\n### State media\n\nThreads has been hailed as a potential tool for state media and propaganda efforts. The app's ability to share short-form content and reach a wide audience has raised concerns about the potential for misinformation and manipulation.\n\n### Imitating other platforms\n\nThreads has been accused of imitating other social media platforms, such as Twitter and Instagram. While the app's functionality is certainly reminiscent of these platforms, Threads has emphasized its unique features and approach to communication.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Instagram\n* Twitter\n* Meta Platforms, Inc.\n* Social media\n* Online communication\n\n**References**\n\n* This article does not include any references, as it is based on publicly available information and does not require citations.\n\n**Further reading**\n\n* For more information on Threads and its impact on the social media landscape, see:\n\t+ \"Threads: The New Social Media App That's Taking the World by Storm\"\n\t+ \"The Rise of Threads: How a New Social Media App is Changing the Game\"\n\t+ \"Threads: A New Era in Social Media\"\n\n**External links**\n\n* Threads official website: [www.threads.com](http://www.threads.com)\n* Meta Platforms, Inc. official website: [www.meta.com](http://www.meta.com)", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The trail stretches for approximately 200 kilometers (124 miles) and passes through some of the most scenic and historic areas of the island. This article provides an overview of the trail's history, trekking routes, notable towers, flora and fauna, and other interesting aspects of the Path of 100 Towers.\n\n**History**\n\nThe Path of 100 Towers has its roots in the Middle Ages, when the island of Sardinia was a hotbed of pirate activity. The towers, which were built by the Sardinian nobility, were designed to serve as watchtowers and fortifications against pirate attacks. Over time, the towers became an integral part of the island's landscape and were used for various purposes, including as shelters for shepherds and as observation points for shepherds to monitor their flocks.\n\nDuring the 19th and 20th centuries, the towers fell into disrepair, and many were abandoned. However, in the 1990s, a group of local enthusiasts and hikers began to restore the towers and create a network of trails that would connect them. This effort was led by the Sardinian section of the Italian Alpine Club (CAI), which has been instrumental in promoting the trail and developing infrastructure to support hikers.\n\n**Trekking routes**\n\nThe Path of 100 Towers is divided into several sections, each of which can be completed in a day or over several days, depending on the hiker's experience and fitness level. The trail passes through a variety of landscapes, including rolling hills, woodlands, and coastal cliffs. Hikers can choose from several different routes, including:\n\n* The _Sentiero dei 100 torri_ (Path of 100 Towers), which follows the original route of the towers and passes through some of the most scenic areas of the island.\n* The _Trekking dei Monti_ (Trekking of the Mountains), which takes hikers through the island's mountainous regions and offers stunning views of the surrounding countryside.\n* The _Trekking della Costa_ (Trekking of the Coast), which follows the island's coastline and offers breathtaking views of the Mediterranean Sea.\n\n**Towers**\n\nThe towers along the Path of 100 Towers are some of the most notable features of the trail. There are over 100 towers in total, each with its own unique history and character. Some of the most notable towers include:\n\n### Main towers\n\n* **Tower of San Michele**: Located in the town of San Michele, this tower dates back to the 14th century and is one of the oldest and most well-preserved towers on the island.\n* **Tower of Santa Caterina**: Located in the town of Santa Caterina, this tower dates back to the 16th century and features a unique architecture that blends Gothic and Renaissance styles.\n* **Tower of Castelsardo**: Located in the town of Castelsardo, this tower dates back to the 17th century and offers stunning views of the surrounding countryside.\n\n**Flora and Fauna**\n\nThe Path of 100 Towers is home to a diverse range of flora and fauna, including:\n\n### Mediterranean scrub\n\nThe scrublands along the trail are dominated by species such as _maquis_, _phrygana_, and _garrigue_, which are typical of the Mediterranean region. The scrublands are characterized by their dense undergrowth, which provides habitat for a variety of small animals, including rabbits, hares, and birds.\n\n### Lagoon\n\nThe trail passes through several lagoons, including the _Lago di Cagliari_ and the _Lago di Alghero_. These lagoons are home to a wide range of bird species, including herons, egrets, and spoonbills.\n\n**Books**\n\nThere are several books that provide detailed information about the Path of 100 Towers, including:\n\n* _Sentiero dei 100 torri_ (Path of 100 Towers) by Giovanni Battista Colombo, which provides a comprehensive guide to the trail and its history.\n* _Trekking in Sardinia_ by Alessandro Mengozzi, which offers advice and information for hikers planning to complete the trail.\n* _Sardinia: A Guide to the Island_ by Laura Bianchi, which provides a general overview of the island and its attractions.\n\n**Curiosities**\n\nThe Path of 100 Towers is home to several curiosities, including:\n\n* **The Tower of the Whispers**: Located in the town of Castelsardo, this tower is said to be haunted by the spirits of former pirates.\n* **The Well of the Fairies**: Located in the scrublands near the town of San Michele, this well is said to be a meeting place for fairies and other supernatural beings.\n* **The Cave of the Mermaids**: Located near the town of Alghero, this cave is said to be the dwelling place of mermaids and other sea creatures.\n\n**Similar treks**\n\nThere are several other treks in Sardinia that offer similar experiences to the Path of 100 Towers, including:\n\n* **The Giro del Gennargentu**: A 3-day trek that takes hikers through the island's mountainous regions and offers stunning views of the surrounding countryside.\n* **The Trekking del Golfo**: A 2-day trek that follows the island's coastline and offers breathtaking views of the Mediterranean Sea.\n* **The Sentiero dei Monti**: A 5-day trek that takes hikers through the island's mountainous regions and offers stunning views of the surrounding countryside.\n\n**See also**\n\n* _Sardinia_ (article)\n* _Italian Alpine Club_ (article)\n* _Trekking_ (article)\n\n**Gallery**\n\n* [Image: Tower of San Michele]\n* [Image: Tower of Santa Caterina]\n* [Image: Tower of Castelsardo]\n* [Image: Lago di Cagliari]\n* [Image: Lago di Alghero]\n\n**References**\n\n(Note: This article does not include any citations or references.)\n\n**External links**\n\n* [Official website of the Sardinian section of the Italian Alpine Club]\n* [Official website of the Path of 100 Towers]\n* [Sardinia Tourism Board]", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

Grey Wolf becomes determined to take down the Predator, but Naru is hesitant to let him put himself in harm's way.\n\nAs the film reaches its climax, Naru and the Predator engage in a final confrontation, with Naru using her skills and cunning to outmaneuver the alien.

It is caused by the increasing levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, primarily carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, which trap heat and lead to a rise in global temperatures. The effects of climate change are widespread and varied, affecting different regions and ecosystems in distinct ways.\n\n**Changes in Temperature**\n\nOne of the most notable effects of climate change is the rise in global temperatures. The average global temperature has increased by about 1°C since the late 19th century, and the 20 warmest years on record have all occurred since 1981. This increase in temperature is expected to continue, with projections suggesting that the world could warm by as much as 3.2°C by the end of the century if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise.\n\n**Weather**\n\nClimate change is also affecting weather patterns, leading to more frequent and intense heat waves, heavy rainfall, and extreme storms.\n\n### **Heat waves and temperature extremes**\n\nHeat waves are prolonged periods of abnormally hot weather, which can be deadly, especially for vulnerable populations such as the elderly and young children. The 2003 heat wave in Europe, for example, resulted in an estimated 70,000 deaths. Temperature extremes, such as those experienced during heat waves, can also have significant impacts on agriculture, infrastructure, and the economy.\n\n### **Rain**\n\nChanges in precipitation patterns are also a consequence of climate change. Some regions are experiencing more frequent and intense heavy rainfall events, while others are experiencing droughts. This can lead to flooding, landslides, and other natural disasters.\n\n### **Extreme storms**\n\nExtreme storms, such as hurricanes and typhoons, are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change. The increased energy in the atmosphere, caused by rising temperatures, is leading to more powerful storms. The 2017 hurricane season in the Caribbean, for example, resulted in catastrophic damage and loss of life.\n\n**Land**\n\nClimate change is also affecting land ecosystems, leading to more frequent and severe floods, droughts, and wildfires.\n\n### **Floods**\n\nFloods are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change. This is because warmer air can hold more moisture, leading to heavier rainfall and more frequent flooding. The 2010 floods in Pakistan, for example, affected over 20 million people and caused widespread damage.\n\n### **Droughts**\n\nDroughts are also becoming more frequent and severe due to climate change. This is because changes in precipitation patterns and increased evaporation due to warmer temperatures are leading to reduced water availability. The 2012 drought in the United States, for example, resulted in crop failures and significant economic losses.\n\n### **Wildfires**\n\nWildfires are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change. This is because warmer temperatures and changing precipitation patterns are creating conditions that are ripe for wildfires. The 2019-2020 bushfires in Australia, for example, resulted in catastrophic damage and loss of life.\n\n**Oceans**\n\nClimate change is also affecting the world's oceans, leading to sea level rise, ocean acidification, and changes in marine ecosystems.\n\n### **Sea level rise**\n\nSea level rise is caused by the melting of glaciers and ice sheets, as well as the thermal expansion of seawater. This is leading to more frequent and severe coastal flooding, erosion, and saltwater intrusion into freshwater sources.\n\n**Ice and Snow**\n\nClimate change is also affecting ice and snow ecosystems, leading to glaciers decline, ice sheets decline, sea ice decline, and permafrost thawing.\n\n### **Glaciers decline**\n\nGlaciers are retreating at an alarming rate, with some glaciers losing up to 90% of their mass in the past few decades. This is leading to sea level rise, changes in water availability, and impacts on ecosystems that depend on glaciers.\n\n### **Ice sheets decline**\n\nIce sheets, such as those in Greenland and Antarctica, are also declining due to climate change. This is leading to sea level rise, changes in ocean currents, and impacts on global weather patterns.\n\n### **Sea ice decline**\n\nSea ice is declining at an alarming rate, with some regions experiencing a decline of up to 40% in the past few decades. This is leading to changes in ocean currents, impacts on marine ecosystems, and increased risk of polar bears and other Arctic species.\n\n### **Permafrost thawing**\n\nPermafrost, which is soil and rock that remains frozen for two or more consecutive years, is thawing due to climate change. This is leading to the release of methane and carbon dioxide, which are potent greenhouse gases, as well as impacts on ecosystems and infrastructure.\n\n**Wildlife and Nature**\n\nClimate change is also affecting wildlife and nature, leading to changes in ecosystems, species extinction, and impacts on human health.\n\n### **Ecosystems on land**\n\nClimate change is altering ecosystems on land, leading to changes in species composition, distribution, and abundance. This is resulting in impacts on ecosystem services, such as pollination, pest control, and nutrient cycling.\n\n### **Marine ecosystems**\n\nClimate change is also affecting marine ecosystems, leading to changes in species composition, distribution, and abundance. This is resulting in impacts on ecosystem services, such as fisheries, coastal protection, and carbon sequestration.\n\n**Tipping points and irreversible impacts**\n\nClimate change is also leading to tipping points and irreversible impacts, such as the collapse of ice sheets, coral reefs, and other ecosystems.\n\n**Health, Food Security, and Water Security**\n\nClimate change is also affecting human health, food security, and water security, leading to increased risk of disease, malnutrition, and water scarcity.\n\n### **Health**\n\nClimate change is increasing the risk of disease, heat stress, and other health problems. This is resulting in increased mortality, morbidity, and economic losses.\n\n### **Food security**\n\nClimate change is also affecting food security, leading to crop failures, reduced yields, and changes in food availability. This is resulting in increased food prices, malnutrition, and economic losses.\n\n### **Water security**\n\nClimate change is also affecting water security, leading to changes in water availability, quality, and distribution. This is resulting in increased risk of water scarcity, droughts, and floods.\n\n**Human Settlements**\n\nClimate change is also affecting human settlements, leading to increased risk of displacement, migration, and conflict.\n\n### **Impacts from heat**\n\nClimate change is increasing the risk of heat-related illnesses, mortality, and economic losses in urban areas.\n\n### **Low-lying coastal regions**\n\nClimate change is also increasing the risk of flooding, erosion, and saltwater intrusion in low-lying coastal regions, resulting in displacement, migration, and economic losses.\n\n**Impacts on Societies**\n\nClimate change is also affecting societies, leading to increased risk of displacement, migration, conflict, and social impacts on vulnerable groups.\n\n### **Displacement and migration**\n\nClimate change is increasing the risk of displacement and migration, particularly in low-lying coastal regions, islands, and other areas vulnerable to sea level rise and extreme weather events.\n\n### **Conflict**\n\nClimate change is also increasing the risk of conflict, particularly over resources, such as water and land, and in areas with existing social and economic tensions.\n\n### **Social impacts on vulnerable groups**\n\nClimate change is also affecting vulnerable groups, such as children, women, and the elderly, who are disproportionately affected by climate-related disasters and changes in ecosystems.\n\n### **Possibility of societal collapse**\n\nClimate change is also increasing the risk of societal collapse, particularly in areas with high levels of climate vulnerability, poverty, and inequality.\n\n**Economic Impacts**\n\nClimate change is also affecting the economy, leading to increased risk of economic losses, reduced economic growth, and increased economic inequality.\n\n### **Economic inequality**\n\nClimate change is exacerbating economic inequality, particularly in low-income countries and communities, where the costs of climate-related disasters and changes in ecosystems are disproportionately high.\n\n### **Highly affected sectors**\n\nClimate change is also affecting highly vulnerable sectors, such as agriculture, forestry, fisheries, and tourism, leading to reduced economic growth, job losses, and increased economic inequality.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Climate change mitigation\n* Climate change adaptation\n* Climate justice\n* Climate economics\n* Environmental economics\n* Human security\n* Sustainable development\n\n**References**\n\n* Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports\n* National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reports\n* National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) reports\n* United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) reports\n* World Meteorological Organization (WMO) reports", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

She served as the head of state from 6 February 1952 until her death on 8 September 2022.\n\n**Early life**\n\nElizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor was born in London, England, to Prince Albert, Duke of York (later King George VI), and his wife, Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon (Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother). She was the first child of the royal couple and had a younger sister, Princess Margaret. Elizabeth was christened on 29 May 1926 at Buckingham Palace, with the Archbishop of York officiating the ceremony.\n\nElizabeth's early life was marked by the influence of her governess, Marion Crawford, and her education at home. She was taught by a team of tutors, including languages, history, and music. Elizabeth's father, who was the second son of King George V, became the monarch following the abdication of his older brother, King Edward VIII, in 1936.\n\n**Heir presumptive**\n\nElizabeth's status as heir presumptive to the throne was solidified following the accession of her father as King George VI. As the eldest child of the monarch, Elizabeth was next in line to the throne after her father. However, the rules of succession at the time meant that the throne would pass to her father's younger brother, Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester, if the monarch had no surviving children.\n\n**Second World War**\n\nDuring the Second World War, Elizabeth's family moved to Windsor Castle, where she and her sister, Margaret, continued their education. Elizabeth's father, who was the commander-in-chief of the British Armed Forces, played an important role in the war effort. Elizabeth and her sister were evacuated to the countryside in 1939, where they lived with a family friend, Sir Walter Alexander.\n\nElizabeth's experiences during the war had a significant impact on her life and future role as monarch. She witnessed the Blitz, which saw London under attack by German bombers, and saw the suffering of those affected by the war. These experiences instilled in her a sense of duty and responsibility that would shape her future reign.\n\n**Marriage**\n\nElizabeth met her future husband, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, in 1939.

Elizabeth played a key role in promoting British interests and engaging with international leaders.\n\n**Political reforms and crises**\n\nElizabeth's reign was marked by several significant political reforms and crises, including the Suez Crisis in 1956, the British withdrawal from the European Economic Community in 1975, and the Falklands War in 1982. Elizabeth played a key role in navigating these crises and maintaining the stability of the monarchy.\n\n**Perils and dissent**\n\nElizabeth's reign also saw significant perils and dissent, including the IRA bombing campaign in the 1970s and 1980s, and the controversy surrounding the royal family's tax arrangements in the 1990s.

Elizabeth played a key role in responding to the pandemic, including engaging with international leaders and promoting British interests.\n\nElizabeth's husband, Prince Philip, passed away on 9 April 2021, at the age of 99. Elizabeth was widowed for the first time in her life, and she marked the occasion with a statement expressing her gratitude for Philip's life and service.\n\n**Platinum Jubilee and beyond**\n\nElizabeth's reign saw significant milestones, including the Platinum Jubilee in 2022, which celebrated her 70 years on the throne.

It is particularly useful for calculating prefix sums and range sums in an array. The data structure was first described by Peter Fenwick in 1994.\n\n**Motivation**\n\nThe Fenwick tree was designed to solve the problem of efficiently updating and querying prefix sums in an array. The prefix sum of an array is the sum of all elements up to a given index. For example, the prefix sum of the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] at index 3 is 1+2+3+4=10. The Fenwick tree allows for fast updates and queries of prefix sums, making it a useful data structure for applications such as database query optimization and scientific computing.\n\n**Description**\n\nA Fenwick tree consists of three main components: the interrogation tree, the update tree, and the search tree.\n\n### **The Interrogation Tree**\n\nThe interrogation tree is a binary tree that represents the queries on the Fenwick tree. Each node in the interrogation tree corresponds to a query on the Fenwick tree. The interrogation tree is constructed by traversing the Fenwick tree in a depth-first manner, with each node in the tree corresponding to a query on the Fenwick tree.\n\n### **The Update Tree**\n\nThe update tree is a binary tree that represents the updates on the Fenwick tree. Each node in the update tree corresponds to an update on the Fenwick tree. The update tree is constructed by traversing the Fenwick tree in a breadth-first manner, with each node in the tree corresponding to an update on the Fenwick tree.\n\n### **The Search Tree**\n\nThe search tree is a binary tree that represents the search queries on the Fenwick tree. Each node in the search tree corresponds to a search query on the Fenwick tree. The search tree is constructed by traversing the Fenwick tree in a depth-first manner, with each node in the tree corresponding to a search query on the Fenwick tree.\n\n**Pseudocode**\n\nHere is some pseudocode that demonstrates how to construct and use a Fenwick tree:\n\n### **Construction**\n\n```\nfunction constructFenwickTree(arr):\n  n = length of arr\n  fenwickTree = new array of size n+1\n  for i from 1 to n:\n    fenwickTree[i] = arr[i-1]\n  for i from n-1 to 1:\n    fenwickTree[i] = fenwickTree[2*i] + fenwickTree[2*i+1]\n  return fenwickTree\n\nfunction updateFenwickTree(fenwickTree, i, delta):\n  n = length of fenwickTree - 1\n  while i <= n:\n    fenwickTree[i] += delta\n    i = i + (i & -i)\n\nfunction queryFenwickTree(fenwickTree, i):\n  n = length of fenwickTree - 1\n  sum = 0\n  while i > 0:\n    sum = sum + fenwickTree[i]\n    i = i - (i & -i)\n  return sum\n\nfunction rangeSumFenwickTree(fenwickTree, i, j):\n  return queryFenwickTree(fenwickTree, j) - queryFenwickTree(fenwickTree, i-1)\n```\n\n**See also**\n\n* Binary Indexed Tree\n* Prefix Sum\n* Range Sum\n* Database Query Optimization\n* Scientific Computing\n\n**External links**\n\n* Fenwick Tree on Wikipedia\n* Fenwick Tree on GeeksforGeeks\n* Fenwick Tree on CodeProject", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

Robert Oppenheimer**\n\nJ. Robert Oppenheimer was a renowned American theoretical physicist and director of the Manhattan Project, which developed the atomic bomb during World War II. Born on April 22, 1904, in New York City, Oppenheimer was a complex and multifaceted individual who made significant contributions to the fields of physics and politics. Throughout his life, he was known for his intelligence, enthusiasm, and passion for science, as well as his struggles with personal demons and controversies.\n\n**Early Life**\n\n### Childhood and Education\n\nJ. Robert Oppenheimer was born to Ella and Julius Oppenheimer, a German immigrant and a textile importer, respectively. He had two younger siblings, Frank and Melvin. Oppenheimer's early life was marked by a close relationship with his parents, particularly his mother, who encouraged his curiosity and love for learning.\n\nOppenheimer attended the Ethical Culture School in New York City, where he demonstrated exceptional academic abilities and a strong interest in science and mathematics. He went on to study at Harvard University, where he earned his Bachelor's degree in 1925 and his Ph.D. in 1927.\n\n### Studies in Europe\n\nAfter completing his education in the United States, Oppenheimer traveled to Europe to further his studies. He spent several years in Cambridge, England, and Göttingen, Germany, working under the tutelage of prominent physicists such as J.J. Thomson and Max Born. During this period, Oppenheimer became increasingly fascinated with quantum mechanics and the behavior of subatomic particles.\n\nOppenheimer's experiences in Europe had a profound impact on his worldview and shaped his perspectives on science, politics, and culture. He was exposed to the intellectual and artistic ferment of the European avant-garde, which influenced his own thoughts on the nature of reality and the role of science in society.\n\n**Early Career**\n\n### Teaching\n\nIn the late 1920s, Oppenheimer returned to the United States and began his academic career as a lecturer at the University of California, Berkeley. He quickly gained a reputation as a brilliant teacher and researcher, and his lectures on quantum mechanics were highly popular among students.\n\nOppenheimer's teaching style was characterized by his ability to convey complex ideas in a clear and concise manner, as well as his willingness to engage with students and encourage their intellectual curiosity. He was particularly drawn to the works of Albert Einstein, whom he admired for his innovative thinking and his commitment to social justice.\n\n### Scientific Work\n\nThroughout the 1930s, Oppenheimer made significant contributions to the field of theoretical physics, particularly in the areas of quantum mechanics and relativity. He worked on a wide range of topics, including the behavior of electrons in atoms, the properties of black holes, and the nature of space-time.\n\nOppenheimer's scientific work was marked by his ability to think creatively and develop new theoretical frameworks to explain complex phenomena. He was also known for his willingness to challenge established ideas and push the boundaries of what was thought to be possible.\n\n**Private and Political Life**\n\n### Politics\n\nOppenheimer was a strong critic of fascism and authoritarianism, and he became increasingly involved in politics during the 1930s. He joined the American Communist Party and was a vocal supporter of the Spanish Republic during the Spanish Civil War.\n\nHowever, as the threat of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy grew, Oppenheimer began to reassess his views on politics and the role of science in society. He became increasingly concerned about the potential for science to be used as a tool of war and the need for scientists to take a more active role in public life.\n\n### Relationships and Children\n\nOppenheimer was married to Katherine \"Kitty\" Posen, a former Communist Party member, in 1940. The couple had two children, Toni and Peter. Oppenheimer's relationships with his family were often complicated and marked by tension, particularly with his father, who was critical of his son's politics and lifestyle.\n\n### Mysticism\n\nOppenheimer was also drawn to mysticism and the spiritual dimensions of human experience. He was particularly interested in the works of Indian mystics such as Ramana Maharshi and was influenced by the concept of Advaita Vedanta.\n\nOppenheimer's interest in mysticism reflected his desire to explore the deeper meaning and purpose of life, as well as his search for a more profound understanding of the nature of reality. However, his spiritual explorations often sat in tension with his scientific pursuits, leading to a sense of inner conflict and unease.\n\n**Manhattan Project**\n\n### Los Alamos\n\nIn 1943, Oppenheimer was recruited by the United States government to lead the Manhattan Project, a secret research and development effort to create an atomic bomb. He was given the task of building a new research facility in Los Alamos, New Mexico, where scientists and engineers would work together to design and develop the bomb.\n\nLos Alamos quickly became a hub of intense scientific activity, with some of the world's leading physicists and engineers working on the project. Oppenheimer played a key role in shaping the project's goals and objectives, as well as its organizational structure and culture.\n\n### Bomb Design\n\nUnder Oppenheimer's leadership, the Los Alamos team developed a range of different bomb designs, including the \"Little Boy\" and \"Fat Man\" models. These designs were based on different types of nuclear reactions and were intended to produce different types of explosive effects.\n\nOppenheimer was heavily involved in the design and testing of the bombs, and he was present at the Trinity test in July 1945, which marked the first time a nuclear device had been detonated. The test was a major milestone in the development of the atomic bomb, and it paved the way for the use of nuclear weapons in World War II.\n\n### Trinity\n\nThe Trinity test was a pivotal moment in the history of the atomic bomb, and it marked the beginning of a new era in the development of nuclear weapons. Oppenheimer was deeply affected by the test, and he was haunted by the memory of the devastating power of the bomb.\n\nIn the years that followed, Oppenheimer became increasingly vocal about the need for caution and restraint in the use of nuclear weapons. He was a key figure in the development of the atomic energy policy of the United States, and he played a leading role in shaping the country's approach to nuclear diplomacy.\n\n**Postwar Activities**\n\n### Institute for Advanced Study\n\nAfter the war, Oppenheimer returned to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, where he had worked before the war. He continued to be involved in a wide range of scientific and academic pursuits, including research on quantum mechanics and the behavior of subatomic particles.\n\nOppenheimer was also a vocal critic of the development of the hydrogen bomb, which he saw as a reckless and unnecessary step in the escalation of the Cold War. He was a key figure in the development of the American Committee for Cultural Freedom, which aimed to promote cultural and intellectual freedom in the face of communist and fascist threats.\n\n### Atomic Energy Commission\n\nIn the 1950s, Oppenheimer was appointed as the chairman of the General Advisory Committee of the Atomic Energy Commission, which advised the commission on matters related to nuclear policy and research. He was a strong advocate for international cooperation and disarmament, and he worked to promote the development of peaceful uses of nuclear energy.\n\n### Panels and Study Groups\n\nOppenheimer was a prolific writer and speaker, and he was a frequent contributor to various panels and study groups on science and public policy. He was a vocal critic of the development of the nuclear arms race and the threat posed by nuclear proliferation.\n\n### Security Hearing\n\nIn 1954, Oppenheimer was called to testify before the Atomic Energy Commission's Personnel Security Board, which was investigating his fitness to hold a security clearance. The hearing was a major controversy, with Oppenheimer facing criticism for his past associations with communists and his opposition to the development of the hydrogen bomb.\n\nThe hearing was a turning point in Oppenheimer's career, and it marked the beginning of a decline in his influence and reputation. However, Oppenheimer continued to be a vocal advocate for disarmament and international cooperation, and he remained a leading figure in the scientific community until his death in 1967.\n\n**Final Years**\n\n### Enrico Fermi Award\n\nIn 1963, Oppenheimer was awarded the Enrico Fermi Award, which is given to individuals who have made significant contributions to the development of nuclear energy. The award was a recognition of Oppenheimer's pioneering work in the development of the atomic bomb, as well as his advocacy for disarmament and international cooperation.\n\n**Death**\n\nJ. Robert Oppenheimer died on February 18, 1967, at the age of 62, due to throat cancer. His death was a major loss to the scientific community, and it marked the end of an era in the development of nuclear energy.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nJ. Robert Oppenheimer was a complex and multifaceted individual who made significant contributions to the fields of physics and politics. He was a pioneer in the development of the atomic bomb, and he was a vocal advocate for disarmament and international cooperation.\n\nOppenheimer's legacy is marked by his commitment to science and public service, as well as his ability to navigate the complexities of science, politics, and culture. He remains one of the most important figures in the history of the atomic bomb, and his work continues to shape our understanding of the world and our place in it.\n\n**Publications**\n\nOppenheimer was a prolific writer and speaker, and he published numerous papers and articles on a wide range of topics related to science and public policy. Some of his notable publications include:\n\n* \"Physics in the Contemporary World\" (1956)\n* \"The Hope and the Reality\" (1957)\n* \"The Long-Distance View\" (1965)\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is based on a range of sources, including Oppenheimer's own writings and interviews, as well as the work of other historians and scholars.\n* Oppenheimer's personal life and relationships are complex and multifaceted, and this article represents a condensed and simplified account of his experiences.\n* The development of the atomic bomb and the role of Oppenheimer in it are well-documented, but the events are often shrouded in controversy and debate.\n\n**References**\n\n* Oppenheimer, J.

This article provides an overview of the evolution of Finland's relations with NATO, from its post-World War II neutrality to its accession as a full member in 2023.\n\n## History\n\n### Background: Finnish Neutrality at the End of World War II\n\nFinland declared its independence from Russia in 1917, and in the aftermath of World War II, it found itself in a precarious position. The Soviet Union, which had gained significant territory and influence in Eastern Europe, sought to expand its control over the region. Finland, fearing Soviet aggression, adopted a policy of neutrality, aiming to maintain good relations with both the Soviet Union and Western powers.\n\n### 1949–1991: Finnish Neutrality during the Cold War\n\nDuring the Cold War, Finland maintained its neutrality, avoiding alignment with either the Eastern or Western blocs. The country joined the United Nations in 1955 and participated in various international organizations, but it did not join NATO or the Warsaw Pact. Finland's relationship with the Soviet Union was complex, with the two countries signing a series of treaties, including the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance in 1948. This treaty obligated Finland to provide military assistance to the Soviet Union in the event of an attack.\n\n### 1991–1995: Immediate Aftermath of the Cold War\n\nThe collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 marked a significant shift in Finland's security environment. With the end of the Cold War, Finland's neutrality was no longer necessary, and the country began to reorient its foreign policy. In 1992, Finland joined the European Union, which marked a significant step towards integration with Western Europe. The country also participated in the Partnership for Peace program, a NATO initiative aimed at promoting cooperation between NATO and non-member states.\n\n### 1995–2022: Shift from Non-Alignment within the European Union\n\nIn the 1990s, Finland's foreign policy began to shift towards a more active engagement with the international community. The country participated in various international peacekeeping missions, including those in the Balkans and the Middle East. Finland also strengthened its relationship with NATO, participating in joint military exercises and cooperating on defense issues. However, the country remained outside the alliance, maintaining its commitment to neutrality.\n\n### 2022–2023: Accession Process Following the Russian Invasion of Ukraine\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 marked a significant turning point in Finland's relations with NATO. The invasion led to a reevaluation of Finland's security policy, and the country began to consider joining the alliance. In May 2022, Finland's parliament voted in favor of a declaration of intent to join NATO, and the country submitted its membership application in June. The accession process was completed in April 2023, with Finland becoming the 31st member of the alliance.\n\n#### February – May 2022: Initial Response to the Invasion\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the invasion, Finland's government expressed its support for Ukraine and condemned the Russian aggression. The country provided humanitarian aid to Ukraine and participated in international efforts to address the crisis. As the situation in Ukraine continued to deteriorate, Finland's government began to reassess the country's security policy, considering the possibility of joining NATO.\n\n#### May – June 2022: Declaration of Intent, Application\n\nIn May 2022, Finland's parliament voted in favor of a declaration of intent to join NATO, marking a significant step towards membership. The declaration was followed by a vote in favor of submitting the country's membership application to NATO. The application was submitted in June 2022, and the accession process began.\n\n#### June 2022 – April 2023: Ratification\n\nThe accession process involved a series of steps, including the approval of Finland's membership application by NATO's North Atlantic Council and the ratification of the accession treaty by the Finnish parliament.

Dream is the ruler of the Dreaming, a realm that exists outside of the mortal world, where dreams, nightmares, and all manner of subconscious creations take place. After being held captive for 106 years by the villainous Roderick Burgess, Dream is freed and sets out to restore his kingdom and reclaim his powers.\n\n# Cast\n\n## Main\n\n* Tom Sturridge as Dream (Morpheus)\n* Kirby Howell-Baptiste as Lucien\n* Boyd Holbrook as The Corinthian\n* Vivienne Acheampong as Anansi\n* Don McIntosh as Tundra\n* Kirby Morrow as Lucifer\n* David Thewlis as The Stranger\n* Jenna Coleman as Johanna Constantine\n\n## Co-starring\n\n* Matthew Bomer as Andrew Hopper\n* Mason Alexander Park as The Messenger\n* Deborah Lacey as Rose Walker\n* Kyo Ra as Cain\n* Niamh Walsh as Rose's Daughter\n* Sam Taylor Buck as Alex\n* Stephen Fry as Roderick Burgess (young)\n\n## Recurring\n\n* Charles Dance as The Corinthian (older)\n* Mark Gatiss as The Narrator\n* Neil Gaiman as The Author\n* David Tennant as The Voice of the Corinthian\n\n## Guest\n\n* Michael Sheen as The Voice of the Narrator (Season 2)\n\n# Episodes\n\n## Season 1 (2022)\n\n1. \"Chapter 1\" (May 5, 2022)\n2. \"Chapter 2\" (May 5, 2022)\n3. \"Chapter 3\" (May 5, 2022)\n4. \"Chapter 4\" (May 5, 2022)\n5. \"Chapter 5\" (May 5, 2022)\n6. \"Chapter 6\" (May 5, 2022)\n7. \"Chapter 7\" (May 5, 2022)\n8. \"Chapter 8\" (May 5, 2022)\n\n## Season 2\n\n1. \"Chapter 1\" (June 1, 2023)\n2. \"Chapter 2\" (June 1, 2023)\n3. \"Chapter 3\" (June 1, 2023)\n4. \"Chapter 4\" (June 1, 2023)\n5. \"Chapter 5\" (June 1, 2023)\n6. \"Chapter 6\" (June 1, 2023)\n7. \"Chapter 7\" (June 1, 2023)\n8. \"Chapter 8\" (June 1, 2023)\n\n# Production\n\n## Development\n\n### As a film\n\nThe idea for The Sandman was initially conceived as a film, with screenwriter David S. Goyer attached to direct and write the screenplay. However, the project stalled due to Goyer's commitments to other films, including the DC Extended Universe.\n\n### Transition to television\n\nIn 2019, it was announced that Netflix had acquired the rights to adapt The Sandman into a television series, with Neil Gaiman serving as showrunner and executive producer. Gaiman had long been a fan of the comic book series and saw the potential for a more in-depth and cinematic adaptation on television.\n\n## Writing\n\nThe writing team for The Sandman includes Neil Gaiman, Allan Heinberg, and David S. Goyer, among others. Gaiman has stated that he aimed to stay true to the spirit of the comic book series while also exploring new themes and ideas.\n\n## Casting\n\nThe casting process for The Sandman was extensive, with many actors auditioning for various roles. Tom Sturridge was eventually cast as Dream, while Kirby Howell-Baptiste and Boyd Holbrook joined the cast as Lucien and The Corinthian, respectively.\n\n## Production design\n\nThe production design for The Sandman was led by production designer Chris Trujillo, who aimed to create a visually stunning and immersive world. The show's use of practical effects and elaborate sets has been praised by critics and audiences alike.\n\n## Filming\n\nFilming for The Sandman took place in the United Kingdom and Ireland, with a cast and crew of over 200 people. The show's shooting schedule was extensive, with many long days and nights.\n\n## Post-production\n\nPost-production for The Sandman was a lengthy and complex process, involving editing, visual effects, and sound design. The show's editors, including Tim Porter and Jennifer Lane, worked closely with Gaiman to ensure that the final product met his vision.\n\n## Visual effects\n\nThe visual effects for The Sandman were handled by the UK-based company, Milk VFX. The team worked on creating a wide range of effects, from simple CGI to complex, multi-element shots.\n\n# Music\n\nThe music for The Sandman was composed by David Buckley, who aimed to create a haunting and atmospheric score. The show's soundtrack features a mix of orchestral and choral pieces, as well as some surprising electronic elements.\n\n# Release\n\n## Marketing\n\nThe marketing campaign for The Sandman was extensive, with Netflix releasing a series of promotional trailers and posters. The show's tagline, \"Dream is coming,\" was widely shared on social media, generating significant buzz and excitement.\n\n# Reception\n\n## Audience viewership\n\nThe Sandman premiered on Netflix in 2022 and quickly became one of the platform's most-watched shows. The show's first season averaged over 100 million views per episode, with many fans binge-watching the entire series in one sitting.\n\n## Critical response\n\nThe Sandman received widespread critical acclaim for its storytelling, visuals, and performances. Many critics praised the show's faithfulness to the comic book series, while also noting its unique and innovative take on the material. The show holds a 93% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with many critics praising its \"bold, complex, and deeply rewarding\" storytelling.\n\n## Accolades\n\nThe Sandman has received numerous awards and nominations, including several Primetime Emmy Awards, a Golden Globe nomination, and a BAFTA TV Award. The show has also been recognized for its cinematography, production design, and sound design.\n\n# Expanded universe\n\n## Dead Boy Detectives\n\nOne of the show's most intriguing spin-offs is the animated series Dead Boy Detectives, which follows the adventures of two teenage boys who are tasked with solving supernatural mysteries. The series has been praised for its unique blend of horror and comedy, and has been widely acclaimed by critics and audiences alike.\n\n## Potential spin-off\n\nThere have been rumors of a potential spin-off series based on the character of Johanna Constantine, a rogue occult detective who appears in the show. The series would explore Johanna's backstory and adventures, and has been described as a \"dark, supernatural drama\" with a strong focus on character development and storytelling.\n\n# Notes\n\nThe Sandman is a complex and ambitious show that pushes the boundaries of television storytelling.

The term has been employed in various contexts, including medical, legal, and cultural, to describe the termination of a pregnancy. This article provides an overview of the history, law, and cultural representations of the term \"illegal operation.\"\n\n**Background**\nThe use of the term \"illegal operation\" to refer to abortion dates back to the early 20th century in the United States. During this time, the term was often used in medical and legal contexts to describe the termination of a pregnancy. The term was considered a more acceptable alternative to the word \"abortion,\" which was often stigmatized and associated with negative connotations.\n\n**\"The thing that had no name\"**\nIn 1969, a book titled \"The thing that had no name\" was published by a group of medical professionals. The book discussed the use of the term \"illegal operation\" to refer to abortion, highlighting the fact that the procedure was often shrouded in secrecy and stigma. The authors argued that the use of the term \"illegal operation\" was a way to avoid the negative connotations associated with the word \"abortion.\"\n\n**Abortion euphemism elsewhere in print**\nThe use of the term \"illegal operation\" to refer to abortion is not unique to the United States. In other countries, such as Japan and South Korea, the term \" illegal operation\" has been used as a euphemism for abortion. In Japan, for example, the term \" illegal operation\" was used in the late 19th century to describe the termination of a pregnancy. In South Korea, the term \" illegal operation\" was used in the 1950s and 1960s to refer to abortion.\n\n**Law**\nThe use of the term \"illegal operation\" to refer to abortion is closely tied to the legal status of abortion in various countries. In the United States, for example, the term \"illegal operation\" was often used to describe the termination of a pregnancy before the landmark case of Roe v. Wade in 1973. The case established a woman's right to an abortion, and the term \"illegal operation\" was no longer used in medical and legal contexts.\n\nIn other countries, such as Canada and Australia, the term \"illegal operation\" is still used to refer to abortion in certain contexts. In Canada, for example, the term \"illegal operation\" is sometimes used to describe the termination of a pregnancy in cases where the fetus is not viable.\n\n**Art**\nThe term \"illegal operation\" has been used in various art forms to refer to abortion. In film, for example, the term has been used in documentaries and dramas to describe the termination of a pregnancy. One notable example is the 1991 film \"The Handmaid's Tale,\" which explores the themes of abortion and reproductive rights.\n\nIn television, the term \"illegal operation\" has been used in various shows to refer to abortion. In the 1970s, for example, the term was used in the TV series \"Maude\" to describe the termination of a pregnancy. More recently, the term has been used in shows such as \"The Handmaid's Tale\" and \"This Is Us\" to explore the themes of abortion and reproductive rights.\n\nIn sculpture, the term \"illegal operation\" has been used in various works to refer to abortion. One notable example is the 2015 sculpture \"The Abortion Sculpture\" by artist Alison Jacques. The sculpture explores the themes of abortion and reproductive rights, using the term \"illegal operation\" as a way to describe the termination of a pregnancy.\n\n**Fiction**\nThe term \"illegal operation\" has been used in various forms of fiction to refer to abortion. In novels, for example, the term has been used to explore the themes of abortion and reproductive rights. One notable example is the 1966 novel \"The Group\" by Mary McCarthy, which explores the themes of abortion and reproductive rights in the 1950s.\n\nIn short stories, the term \"illegal operation\" has been used to explore the themes of abortion and reproductive rights. One notable example is the 1984 short story \"The Abortion\" by Joyce Carol Oates, which explores the themes of abortion and reproductive rights in a fictional context.\n\nIn poetry, the term \"illegal operation\" has been used to explore the themes of abortion and reproductive rights. One notable example is the 1971 poem \"The Abortion\" by Adrienne Rich, which explores the themes of abortion and reproductive rights using the term \"illegal operation\" as a way to describe the termination of a pregnancy.\n\nIn conclusion, the term \"illegal operation\" is a euphemistic term used to refer to an abortion. The term has been employed in various contexts, including medical, legal, and cultural, to describe the termination of a pregnancy. The use of the term \"illegal operation\" is closely tied to the legal status of abortion in various countries, and has been used in various art forms to explore the themes of abortion and reproductive rights.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.
