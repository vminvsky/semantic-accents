I can, however, provide a comprehensive article about the Agnipath Scheme within the 2048-character limit. \n\nThe Agnipath Scheme is a transformative initiative introduced by the Government of India on 14 June 2022 to reform the recruitment process of the Indian Armed Forces. This new scheme aims to modernize the armed forces by making them more youthful and technologically adept. The introduction of the scheme has generated a mix of reactions, ranging from enthusiasm to criticism.\n\n## Background\n\nThe Indian Armed Forces have been facing a severe shortage of personnel, with a significant number of serving personnel nearing retirement. The traditional recruitment process, which has been in place for decades, has been criticized for being lengthy and inefficient. The Agnipath Scheme seeks to address these issues by introducing a more streamlined and efficient recruitment process.\n\n## Overview\n\nUnder the Agnipath Scheme, the Indian Armed Forces will recruit youth in the age group of 17.5 to 23 years for a short service of three years, followed by a four-year period of training and service. The selected candidates will be called 'Agniveers,' and they will be entitled to receive a daily stipend of ₹30,000. After completing their three-year tenure, the Agniveers will be eligible for re-enlistment in the armed forces. The scheme also includes a provision for the Agniveers to be employed in civilian organizations or start their own businesses after completion of their service.\n\n## Reservation and welfare benefits\n\nThe Agnipath Scheme includes provisions for reservation and welfare benefits for the Agniveers. A total of 10% of the vacancies will be reserved for Agniveers who wish to re-enlist in the armed forces after completing their initial three-year tenure. The Agniveers will also be eligible for a one-time lump sum payment of ₹11.7 lakhs after completion of their service. The scheme also includes provisions for medical facilities, education loans, and skill development training for the Agniveers.\n\n## Criticism\n\n### By political parties and activists\n\nThe Agnipath Scheme has been criticized by various political parties and activists, who have raised concerns about the impact of the scheme on the employment prospects of youth. The opposition parties have accused the government of introducing the scheme without consulting the stakeholders and without considering the long-term implications of the scheme. The activists have also raised concerns about the social and economic implications of the scheme.\n\n### By retired defence personnel\n\nThe Agnipath Scheme has also been criticized by retired defence personnel, who have expressed concerns about the impact of the scheme on the morale of the serving personnel. The retired personnel have accused the government of compromising the national security by introducing a scheme that may lead to a shortage of experienced personnel in the armed forces. The retired personnel have also raised concerns about the lack of transparency in the recruitment process.\n\n### By state governments\n\nThe Agnipath Scheme has also been criticized by some state governments, which have raised concerns about the impact of the scheme on the state's employment prospects. The state governments have accused the central government of not considering the state's interests while introducing the scheme. The state governments have also raised concerns about the lack of coordination between the central and state governments in implementing the scheme.\n\n### Data on employment of veterans\n\nAccording to data available, the employment prospects of veterans are not improving under the Agnipath Scheme. The data shows that a significant number of veterans are still facing difficulties in finding employment after completion of their service. The data also shows that the scheme has not been able to address the issue of unemployment among veterans.\n\n## Protests\n\n### Bharat Bandh (All India Strike)\n\nThe introduction of the Agnipath Scheme has led to widespread protests across the country. The protests began on 18 June 2022, when various trade unions and opposition parties called for a bandh (strike) to protest against the scheme. The protests were marked by violence, with reports of stone-pelting, vandalism, and arson. The protests continued for several days, with the protesters demanding the withdrawal of the scheme.\n\n### 21 June onwards\n\nThe protests continued on 21 June 2022, with the protesters blocking roads, rail tracks, and highways. The protests were marked by violence, with reports of stone-pelting, vandalism, and arson. The government deployed security forces to control the situation, but the protests continued unabated.\n\n## Response by the Government\n\nThe government has responded to the protests by announcing a series of measures to address the concerns of the protesters. The government has announced that it will increase the number of vacancies for Agniveers and provide more training and employment opportunities for them. The government has also announced that it will provide more benefits to the Agniveers, including a higher lump sum payment and more medical facilities.\n\n## Plea in the Supreme Court against the scheme\n\nThe protesters have also filed a plea in the Supreme Court against the Agnipath Scheme, alleging that the scheme is unconstitutional and violates the fundamental rights of the citizens. The court has issued a notice to the government, asking it to respond to the plea.\n\n## First Agniveer batch (2023)\n\nThe first batch of Agniveers is scheduled to be inducted into the armed forces in 2023. The selection process for the first batch is underway, and it is expected to be completed soon. The selected candidates will undergo a four-year training program, after which they will be eligible for re-enlistment in the armed forces.\n\n### Hyderabad\n\nThe first batch of Agniveers will be inducted into the Indian Army's Telangana Regimental Center in Hyderabad. The center will provide training to the Agniveers in various military skills, including combat training, first aid, and communication.\n\n### Nashik\n\nThe second batch of Agniveers will be inducted into the Indian Navy's Nashik Naval Base. The base will provide training to the Agniveers in various maritime skills, including navigation, communication, and combat training.\n\n### Ranikhet\n\nThe third batch of Agniveers will be inducted into the Indian Air Force's Ranikhet Air Force Station. The station will provide training to the Agniveers in various aviation skills, including flying, navigation, and combat training.\n\n## Amendment in recruitment procedure\n\nThe government has announced an amendment in the recruitment procedure for the Agniveers. The amendment includes a provision for the selection of Agniveers based on a merit-based system, rather than a lottery system. The amendment also includes a provision for the selection of Agniveers from the open market, rather than only from the defense forces.\n\n## See also\n\n* Indian Armed Forces\n* Defense recruitment\n* Military training\n* Veterans' welfare\n\n## External links\n\n* Agnipath Scheme: Official website\n* Indian Armed Forces: Official website", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

{"title": "Fenwick_tree", "content": "#Motivation\n#Description\n##The interrogation tree\n##The update tree\n##The search tree\n#Pseudocode\n##Construction\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Fenwick Tree\n\nA Fenwick tree is a data structure used for efficiently updating and querying cumulative sum queries in an array. It is a type of binary indexed tree, designed to provide fast and efficient operations for updating and searching the prefix sums of an array.\n\nMotivation\n\nThe Fenwick tree was developed in the 1970s by Peter Fenwick, an Australian computer scientist. At the time, Fenwick was working on a project to optimize the processing of financial data, which involved frequent updates and queries on the cumulative sums of large arrays.\n\nDescription\n\nA Fenwick tree consists of three main components: the interrogation tree, the update tree, and the search tree. These components work together to provide the core functionality of the data structure.\n\n### The Interrogation Tree\n\nThe interrogation tree is used to store the prefix sums of the array. It is a binary tree where each node represents a prefix sum. The root node represents the entire array, while the child nodes represent the prefix sums of the left and right subtrees.\n\nEach node in the interrogation tree contains two values: the prefix sum and the index of the last element in the subtree. The prefix sum is the sum of the elements in the subtree, while the index is the highest index of the elements in the subtree.\n\n### The Update Tree\n\nThe update tree is used to store the updates to the array. It is a binary tree where each node represents an update to the array. The update tree is used to efficiently update the prefix sums in the interrogation tree.\n\nEach node in the update tree contains two values: the update value and the index of the element being updated. The update value is the value being added to the element, while the index is the index of the element being updated.\n\n### The Search Tree\n\nThe search tree is used to efficiently search for the prefix sums in the interrogation tree. It is a binary search tree where each node represents a prefix sum. The search tree is used to quickly locate the node in the interrogation tree that corresponds to a given prefix sum.\n\nPseudocode\n\nHere is a pseudocode implementation of the Fenwick tree:\n\n#### Construction\n\n```\n  Function FenwickTree(array):\n    interrogation_tree = New InterrogationTree()\n    update_tree = New UpdateTree()\n\n    For i = 0 to array.length - 1:\n      interrogation_tree.Add(array[i])\n      update_tree.Add(0, i)\n\n    Return {interrogation_tree, update_tree}\n\n  Function Add(interrogation_tree, update_tree, index, value):\n    interrogation_tree.Add(value, index)\n    update_tree.Add(value, index)\n\n  Function Query(interrogation_tree, index):\n    prefix_sum = 0\n    While index > 0:\n      prefix_sum += interrogation_tree.Get(index)\n      index = (index & (index - 1)) + 1\n\n    Return prefix_sum\n\n  Function RangeQuery(interrogation_tree, start, end):\n    prefix_sum = Query(interrogation_tree, end)\n    prefix_sum -= Query(interrogation_tree, start - 1)\n    Return prefix_sum\n```\n\nSee also\n\n* Binary Indexed Tree\n* Prefix Sum\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n* Peter Fenwick's homepage\n* Fenwick Tree on CodeProject\n* Fenwick Tree on GeeksforGeeks", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

Robert Oppenheimer**\n\nJ. Robert Oppenheimer was a renowned American theoretical physicist, best known for his role as the director of the Manhattan Project, the research and development project that produced the first atomic bombs during World War II. He was a pivotal figure in the development of modern physics, making significant contributions to the fields of quantum mechanics, relativity, and nuclear physics.\n\n**Early Life**\n\n### Childhood and Education\n\nJulius Robert Oppenheimer was born on April 22, 1904, in New York City, to Ella and Julius Oppenheimer. His family was of Jewish descent, and his father was a successful textile importer. Oppenheimer's early education took place at the Ethical Culture School in New York, where he developed a passion for learning and a strong interest in science.\n\nIn 1921, Oppenheimer enrolled at Harvard University, where he studied chemistry and physics. He was an outstanding student, and his natural talent and curiosity were encouraged by his professors. In 1925, Oppenheimer traveled to Europe, where he studied under some of the most prominent physicists of the time, including Max Born and Niels Bohr.\n\n### Studies in Europe\n\nOppenheimer's time in Europe was a formative period in his development as a physicist. He spent several years studying and teaching at the University of Göttingen, where he became friends with Werner Heisenberg and Erwin Schrödinger. He also spent time at the University of Cambridge, where he worked with Paul Dirac and was exposed to the latest developments in quantum mechanics.\n\nDuring his time in Europe, Oppenheimer developed a deep understanding of quantum theory and its applications. He was particularly interested in the role of wave-particle duality and the implications of quantum mechanics for our understanding of reality. His work during this period laid the foundation for his later contributions to the development of nuclear physics.\n\n**Early Career**\n\n### Teaching\n\nIn 1929, Oppenheimer returned to the United States, where he was appointed as a lecturer in physics at the University of California, Berkeley. He quickly established himself as a talented and innovative teacher, and his lectures were highly popular among students.\n\nOppenheimer's teaching style was characterized by his ability to explain complex concepts in simple terms and his enthusiasm for the subject matter. He was particularly interested in teaching students about the latest developments in physics, and he encouraged his students to think critically and ask questions.\n\n### Scientific Work\n\nIn the early 1930s, Oppenheimer began to focus on nuclear physics, a field that was rapidly expanding at the time. He made significant contributions to the understanding of nuclear reactions and the properties of atomic nuclei.\n\nOne of Oppenheimer's most notable contributions during this period was his work on the \"uranium machine,\" a hypothetical device that could be used to harness the energy of uranium nuclei. His work in this area laid the foundation for the development of nuclear reactors and nuclear power.\n\n**Private and Political Life**\n\n### Politics\n\nOppenheimer was a vocal critic of fascism and nationalism, and he was deeply concerned about the rise of totalitarian regimes in Europe during the 1930s. He was a strong supporter of the Democratic Party and was involved in various left-wing causes, including the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nIn the 1940s, Oppenheimer became increasingly involved in politics, and he served as a member of the National Defense Research Committee. He played a key role in the development of the atomic bomb, and he was a vocal advocate for the use of the bomb to end the war in the Pacific.\n\n### Relationships and Children\n\nIn 1940, Oppenheimer married Katherine \"Kitty\" Posen, a Russian-born woman who was a member of the Communist Party. The couple had two children, Toni and Peter, but their marriage was ultimately troubled by Oppenheimer's infidelity and Kitty's mental health issues.\n\n### Mysticism\n\nOppenheimer was deeply interested in mysticism and the nature of reality. He was particularly drawn to the ideas of Eastern mysticism, including Buddhism and Taoism. He believed that these traditions offered a deeper understanding of the universe and our place within it.\n\nOppenheimer's interest in mysticism was reflected in his poetry, which he wrote throughout his life. His poetry was characterized by its use of imagery and symbolism, and it often explored themes of love, death, and the nature of reality.\n\n**Manhattan Project**\n\n### Los Alamos\n\nIn 1943, Oppenheimer was appointed as the director of the Manhattan Project, a research and development project that was tasked with producing the first atomic bombs. He was responsible for overseeing the project's research and development, and he worked closely with his colleagues to develop the bomb.\n\nOppenheimer's leadership of the Manhattan Project was instrumental in its success. He was a brilliant scientist and a skilled administrator, and he was able to bring together a team of talented scientists and engineers to work on the project.\n\n### Bomb Design\n\nOppenheimer played a key role in the design of the atomic bomb. He was responsible for developing the theoretical framework for the bomb, and he worked closely with his colleagues to develop the practical design.\n\nOne of Oppenheimer's most notable contributions to the bomb design was his work on the \"implosion\" method, a technique that involved using a sphere of conventional explosives to compress a core of fissile material to the point where it would undergo a chain reaction.\n\n### Trinity\n\nOn July 16, 1945, Oppenheimer witnessed the first nuclear test, code-named \"Trinity.\" The test was a massive success, and it marked the beginning of the atomic age.\n\nOppenheimer's reaction to the test was one of awe and horror. He later described the experience as a \"kind of mystical feeling,\" and he reflected on the implications of the test for humanity.\n\n**Postwar Activities**\n\n### Institute for Advanced Study\n\nIn 1947, Oppenheimer was appointed as the director of the Institute for Advanced Study, a prestigious research institution in Princeton, New Jersey. He served in this position until 1966, and he played a key role in shaping the institution's research agenda.\n\nDuring his time at the Institute, Oppenheimer was a vocal advocate for the support of basic research. He believed that research should be driven by curiosity and a desire to understand the world, rather than by practical applications.\n\n### Atomic Energy Commission\n\nIn 1947, Oppenheimer was appointed as a member of the Atomic Energy Commission, a government agency responsible for regulating the use of nuclear energy. He served in this position until 1952, and he played a key role in shaping the commission's policies.\n\n### Panels and Study Groups\n\nOppenheimer was a prolific member of panels and study groups, and he served on numerous committees and boards throughout his career. He was a vocal advocate for the use of science and technology to address social and economic problems.\n\n### Security Hearing\n\nIn 1954, Oppenheimer was the subject of a security clearance hearing, in which his loyalty and trustworthiness were questioned. The hearing was a result of his past associations with communists and his vocal criticisms of the nuclear arms race.\n\nOppenheimer's security clearance was ultimately revoked, and he was barred from participating in government research projects. He later reflected on the experience as a \"personal tragedy,\" and he believed that it was a result of the \"Red Scare\" and the McCarthyism of the time.\n\n**Final Years**\n\n### Enrico Fermi Award\n\nIn 1963, Oppenheimer was awarded the Enrico Fermi Award, a prestigious award for contributions to nuclear energy. He was recognized for his work on the Manhattan Project and his contributions to the development of nuclear physics.\n\n### Death\n\nJ. Robert Oppenheimer died on February 18, 1967, at the age of 62. He was buried in Pine Barrens, New Jersey, and his death was widely mourned by the scientific community.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nOppenheimer's legacy is complex and multifaceted. He is remembered as a brilliant scientist and a talented administrator, and his contributions to nuclear physics are still studied and debated today.\n\nHowever, his legacy is also marked by controversy and tragedy. His association with communists and his vocal criticisms of the nuclear arms race led to his security clearance being revoked, and he was eventually barred from participating in government research projects.\n\nDespite these challenges, Oppenheimer remained a vocal advocate for the use of science and technology to address social and economic problems. He believed that science should be driven by curiosity and a desire to understand the world, rather than by practical applications.\n\n**Publications**\n\nOppenheimer published numerous papers and articles throughout his career, and his work was widely recognized as authoritative and influential. Some of his notable publications include:\n\n* \"The Problems of Atomic Physics\" (1930)\n* \"On the Theory of the Atomic Nucleus\" (1931)\n* \"The Structure of the Atomic Nucleus\" (1932)\n* \"The Implosion Method for the Production of Super-Critical Masses\" (1943)\n* \"The Development of the Atomic Bomb\" (1947)\n* \"Atomic Energy and the Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy\" (1954)\n\n**Notes**\n\nThis article is based on a variety of sources, including Oppenheimer's papers and articles, as well as biographies and histories of the Manhattan Project and the development of nuclear physics.\n\n**References**\n\nThis article does not include any references, as the author has not been able to verify the accuracy of the information presented.\n\n**Sources**\n\nThe following sources were used in the preparation of this article:\n\n* J.

While Finland has maintained its neutrality and sovereignty, it has also sought to maintain good relations with the Western powers, including those in NATO. This article provides an overview of the history of Finland-NATO relations, from the background of Finnish neutrality at the end of World War II to the present day.\n\n**History**\n\n### Background: Finnish Neutrality at the End of World War II\n\nAfter World War II, Finland found itself in a precarious position, sandwiched between the Soviet Union to the east and Sweden to the west. The country had fought two wars against the Soviet Union (1939-1940 and 1941-1944), and the Soviet Union had imposed the Moscow Armistice, which forced Finland to cede territory and recognize Soviet influence in the country. In the aftermath of the war, Finland declared its neutrality, with the aim of avoiding entanglement in the Cold War and maintaining good relations with both the Western and Eastern blocs.\n\n### 1949–1991: Finnish Neutrality During the Cold War\n\nDuring the Cold War, Finland maintained its neutrality, but this did not mean that it was immune to the pressures of the ideological divide. The Soviet Union continued to exert influence over Finland, and the country's security policy was shaped by its desire to avoid provoking the Soviet Union. Finland also sought to maintain good relations with the Western powers, including the United States and the United Kingdom. The country's membership in the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and the signing of the Nordic Balance Treaty with Sweden and Norway in 1962 were attempts to maintain its ties to the West while avoiding NATO membership.\n\n### 1991–1995: Immediate Aftermath of the Cold War\n\nThe collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 marked a significant turning point in Finnish history, as the country was suddenly freed from Soviet dominance. The new government, led by Prime Minister Esko Aho, sought to redefine Finland's security policy and relations with NATO. In 1992, Finland joined the Partnership for Peace (PfP) program, which allowed it to participate in NATO-led peacekeeping operations. However, Finland's commitment to neutrality remained strong, and the country refused to join NATO.\n\n### 1995–2022: Shift from Non-Alignment within the European Union\n\nIn the 1990s, Finland joined the European Union (EU), which marked a significant shift in its foreign policy. The country's relations with NATO began to evolve, as it participated in EU-led peacekeeping operations and engaged in joint military exercises with NATO member states. In 2008, Finland signed the NATO-EU Strategic Partnership Agreement, which formalized cooperation between the two organizations. However, Finland's commitment to neutrality remained unchanged, and the country continued to pursue a policy of non-alignment.\n\n### 2022–2023: Accession Process Following the Russian Invasion of Ukraine\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 marked a turning point in Finland's relations with NATO. The Finnish government, led by Prime Minister Sanna Marin, initially responded cautiously to the crisis, but as the situation in Ukraine escalated, Finland began to reevaluate its security policy. In May 2022, Finland submitted a declaration of intent to join NATO, and in June, it submitted an application for membership. The accession process was marked by a series of diplomatic efforts, including a visit by NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg to Finland in June 2022.\n\n### February – May 2022: Initial Response to the Invasion\n\nThe initial response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine was cautious, as Finland sought to avoid provoking Russia. The Finnish government, led by Prime Minister Sanna Marin, emphasized the need for dialogue and diplomacy to resolve the crisis. However, as the situation in Ukraine escalated, Finland began to reevaluate its security policy. In February 2022, Finland participated in a joint EU-NATO statement condemning the Russian invasion.\n\n### May – June 2022: Declaration of Intent, Application\n\nIn May 2022, Finland submitted a declaration of intent to join NATO, which was seen as a significant step towards membership. The declaration was followed by an application for membership, which was submitted to NATO headquarters in Brussels. The application marked the beginning of a formal accession process, which would involve a series of diplomatic efforts and negotiations with NATO member states.\n\n### June 2022 – April 2023: Ratification\n\nThe accession process was marked by a series of diplomatic efforts, including a visit by NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg to Finland in June 2022. The visit was seen as a significant step towards membership, and it marked the beginning of a new era in Finland's relations with NATO. In April 2023, NATO member states ratified Finland's accession, marking the final step in the membership process.\n\n**Finland's Foreign Relations with Other NATO Member States**\n\nFinland's membership in NATO has significant implications for its foreign relations with other NATO member states. The country has established strong ties with NATO member states, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and France. Finland has also engaged in joint military exercises with NATO member states, including a major exercise with the United States in 2022. The country's membership in NATO has also strengthened its ties with other Nordic countries, including Sweden and Norway.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Finland's security policy\n* NATO-EU relations\n* Partnership for Peace\n* European Free Trade Association\n* Nordic Balance Treaty\n* Moscow Armistice\n\n**References**\n\n* Finnish Ministry of Defence.

This term has been used in various contexts, including law, art, and literature, to describe actions that are prohibited by law or societal norms.\n\n**History**\n\n### Background\n\nThe use of euphemisms to describe illicit activities dates back to ancient times. In many cultures, it was common to use indirect language to avoid offending or alarming others. This practice continued through the centuries, with various societies developing their own unique euphemisms for sensitive or taboo subjects.\n\n### \"The thing that had no name\"\n\nOne notable example of a euphemism is the phrase \"the thing that had no name,\" which was used by the American public to describe the Vietnam War. This term was chosen to avoid using the word \"war,\" which was seen as too confrontational. Instead, the phrase \"the thing that had no name\" conveyed a sense of uncertainty and ambiguity.\n\n### Abortion euphemism elsewhere in print\n\nIn the context of abortion, various euphemisms have been used to describe the procedure. For example, in the 19th century, the term \"medicinal discharge\" was used to refer to abortion. Similarly, in the 20th century, the phrase \"terminating a pregnancy\" became a common way to describe abortion. These euphemisms were often used to avoid offending or alienating those who held strong views on the subject.\n\n**Law**\n\nIn the realm of law, illegal operations often refer to covert activities that are prohibited by statute or regulation. This can include espionage, hacking, or other forms of cybercrime. The use of euphemisms in this context can serve to obscure the true nature of the activity, making it more difficult to detect or prosecute.\n\nSome examples of illegal operations in the law include:\n\n*   **CIA Operation Ajax**: A covert operation conducted by the Central Intelligence Agency in 1953 to overthrow the government of Iran.\n*   **Operation Northwoods**: A proposed operation by the US military in the 1960s to create a pretext for invading Cuba.\n*   **Operation Mockingbird**: A CIA operation to influence the media during the 1950s and 1960s.\n\n**Art**\n\nIn the realm of art, illegal operations often refer to surreptitious or clandestine activities that are not explicitly stated. This can include:\n\n*   **Film**: In film, illegal operations can refer to covert activities that are not explicitly stated, such as a spy thriller where the protagonist is working undercover.\n*   **Television**: In television, illegal operations can refer to clandestine activities that are not explicitly stated, such as a police procedural where the detectives are working undercover.\n*   **Sculpture**: In sculpture, illegal operations can refer to surreptitious or clandestine activities that are not explicitly stated, such as a sculpture that depicts a controversial or taboo subject.\n*   **Fiction**: In fiction, illegal operations can refer to covert or clandestine activities that are not explicitly stated, such as a novel that explores the world of espionage or cybercrime.\n\nSome examples of illegal operations in art include:\n\n*   **The Spy Who Came in from the Cold**: A novel by John le Carré that explores the world of espionage.\n*   **The Bourne Identity**: A novel by Robert Ludlum that explores the world of espionage and identity theft.\n*   **The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo**: A novel by Stieg Larsson that explores the world of cybercrime and corruption.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The team was founded in 2021 as a replacement for the now-defunct Gujarat Lions, which was one of the original eight teams in the IPL.\n\n**Franchise history**\n\nThe Gujarat Titans were established by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) after the conclusion of the 2020 IPL season. The team was awarded to a consortium led by CVC Capital Partners, a global investment firm, for a reported ₹5,250 crore. The consortium included other investors such as Jay Shrinivasan, Suresh Chellaram, and Arun Singh Pauranik. The team's ownership is shared equally between the consortium members.\n\nThe Gujarat Titans' logo and branding were unveiled in March 2021, with a tagline that reads \"Unleash the Titans.\" The team's home ground is the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, which has a seating capacity of over 132,000.\n\n**Team history**\n\nThe Gujarat Titans made their debut in the 2022 IPL season, which was held in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The team finished the season in eighth place, with a record of 6 wins and 10 losses. In their first season, the Titans were led by Hardik Pandya, who was appointed as the team's captain.\n\nIn the 2022 season, the Titans had a strong start, winning three of their first four games. However, they struggled in the middle of the season, losing five consecutive games. The team's fortunes changed in the second half of the season, with the Titans winning four of their last six games.\n\n**Team identity**\n\nThe Gujarat Titans' team identity is centered around their logo and branding. The team's logo features a stylized letter \"G\" made up of a sword and a shield, which represents the bravery and strength of the people of Gujarat. The team's colors are a combination of orange and white, which are the colors of the Indian national flag.\n\nThe Titans' team culture is built around the concept of \"Titans,\" which represents strength, courage, and determination. The team's players are encouraged to embody these values both on and off the field.\n\n**Home ground**\n\nThe Gujarat Titans play their home games at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. The stadium has a seating capacity of over 132,000 and is one of the largest cricket stadiums in the world. The stadium was opened in 2020 and has hosted several high-profile cricket matches, including international cricket matches and the IPL.\n\nThe stadium is named after Narendra Modi, the Prime Minister of India, who is from Gujarat. The stadium's design is inspired by the traditional architecture of Gujarat and features a unique blend of modern and traditional elements.\n\n**Kit manufacturers and sponsors**\n\nThe Gujarat Titans' kits are manufactured by Adidas, a German sportswear company.

The primary goal of climate change mitigation is to slow or prevent the rate of global warming, thereby reducing the adverse impacts on the environment, human health, and the economy.\n\n**Definitions and scope**\n\nClimate change mitigation encompasses a broad range of activities, including reducing emissions from energy production and use, increasing energy efficiency, transitioning to low-carbon energy sources, preserving and enhancing carbon sinks, and implementing policies and practices to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n**Relationship with solar radiation modification (SRM)**\n\nSolar radiation modification (SRM) refers to the intentional alteration of the Earth's energy balance by reflecting or absorbing solar radiation. While SRM is a potential tool for mitigating climate change, it is still a highly speculative and contested area of research. Some proponents of SRM argue that it could provide a temporary solution to mitigate the effects of climate change while more comprehensive and permanent solutions are developed. However, others raise concerns about the unintended consequences of SRM and its potential to exacerbate existing social and economic inequalities.\n\n**Emission trends and pledges**\n\nThe rate of greenhouse gas emissions has continued to rise despite international agreements to reduce emissions. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), global CO2 emissions have increased by 40% since 1990, with the largest increases coming from the energy sector.\n\n**Needed emissions cuts**\n\nTo limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, global CO2 emissions must be reduced by 45% by 2030 and reach net-zero by 2050. This requires a rapid transition to low-carbon energy sources, energy efficiency measures, and the preservation and enhancement of carbon sinks.\n\n**Pledges**\n\nCountries have made various pledges to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. The most notable of these is the Paris Agreement, which commits countries to reducing their net greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050. However, the effectiveness of these pledges is uncertain, and many countries are not on track to meet their commitments.\n\n**Low-carbon energy**\n\nLow-carbon energy sources, such as solar and wind power, are becoming increasingly cost-competitive with fossil fuels. However, their variable nature requires the development of new energy storage technologies and grid management systems.\n\n**Solar and wind energy**\n\nSolar and wind energy have seen significant growth in recent years, driven by declining costs and improving technology. However, their variable output requires the development of new energy storage technologies and grid management systems.\n\n**Other renewables**\n\nOther renewable energy sources, such as hydro, geothermal, and biomass, are also important contributors to the global energy mix. However, their development and deployment are often hindered by technical, financial, and regulatory barriers.\n\n**Integrating variable renewable energy**\n\nThe increasing penetration of variable renewable energy sources requires the development of new energy storage technologies and grid management systems. This includes the use of battery storage, pumped hydro storage, and other innovative technologies.\n\n**Nuclear power**\n\nNuclear power is a low-carbon energy source that can provide baseload power. However, its development and deployment are often hindered by safety concerns, high costs, and regulatory barriers.\n\n**Replacing coal with natural gas**\n\nThe transition from coal to natural gas is a critical step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, the use of natural gas also has environmental impacts, including methane emissions and water pollution.\n\n**Demand reduction**\n\nDemand reduction, including energy conservation and efficiency, is a critical strategy for mitigating climate change. This includes the use of energy-efficient appliances, buildings, and transportation systems.\n\n**Energy conservation and efficiency**\n\nEnergy conservation and efficiency measures can reduce energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions. This includes the use of energy-efficient appliances, buildings, and transportation systems.\n\n**Lifestyle changes**\n\nLifestyle changes, such as reducing meat consumption and adopting a more plant-based diet, can also reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, changes in family size and population growth can also impact greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n**Dietary change**\n\nDietary changes, such as reducing meat consumption and adopting a more plant-based diet, can reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This includes the use of plant-based protein sources, reducing food waste, and improving agricultural practices.\n\n**Family size**\n\nFamily size and population growth can also impact greenhouse gas emissions. Reducing family size and promoting education and family planning can help reduce population growth and its associated greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n**Preserving and enhancing carbon sinks**\n\nPreserving and enhancing carbon sinks, such as forests, soils, and wetlands, is critical for mitigating climate change. This includes the conservation of natural habitats, reforestation, and sustainable land-use practices.\n\n**Forests**\n\nForests are critical carbon sinks, and their preservation and enhancement are essential for mitigating climate change. This includes the conservation of natural habitats, reforestation, and sustainable land-use practices.\n\n### Conservation\n\nConservation efforts, such as protected areas and sustainable forest management, can help preserve and enhance forest carbon sinks.\n\n### Afforestation and reforestation\n\nAfforestation and reforestation efforts can also help enhance forest carbon sinks. This includes the planting of new trees and the restoration of degraded forests.\n\n**Soils**\n\nSoils are also critical carbon sinks, and their preservation and enhancement are essential for mitigating climate change. This includes the use of conservation agriculture, reducing tillage, and cover cropping.\n\n**Wetlands**\n\nWetlands are also critical carbon sinks, and their preservation and enhancement are essential for mitigating climate change. This includes the conservation of natural habitats, reforestation, and sustainable land-use practices.\n\n**Deep ocean**\n\nThe deep ocean is also a critical carbon sink, and its preservation and enhancement are essential for mitigating climate change. This includes the conservation of natural habitats, reducing ocean acidification, and sustainable fishing practices.\n\n**Enhanced weathering**\n\nEnhanced weathering, such as the use of liming or mineral carbonation, can also help sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.\n\n**Other methods to capture and store CO2**\n\nOther methods to capture and store CO2, such as direct air capture and carbon mineralization, are also being developed and deployed.\n\n**Mitigation by sector**\n\nClimate change mitigation can be achieved through various sectors, including buildings, urban planning, transportation, agriculture, forestry, and industry.\n\n**Buildings**\n\nBuildings can be designed and constructed to be energy-efficient and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This includes the use of passive design, insulation, and energy-efficient appliances.\n\n**Urban planning**\n\nUrban planning can also reduce greenhouse gas emissions by promoting compact and connected cities, reducing transportation needs, and increasing green spaces.\n\n**Transport**\n\nTransportation is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, and reducing emissions from transportation requires the development of low-carbon transportation systems, such as electric vehicles and public transportation.\n\n### Shipping\n\nShipping is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, and reducing emissions from shipping requires the development of low-carbon shipping systems, such as electric and hydrogen fuel cells.\n\n### Air transport\n\nAir transport is also a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, and reducing emissions from air transport requires the development of low-carbon aviation systems, such as electric and hybrid-electric propulsion.\n\n**Agriculture, forestry and land use**\n\nAgriculture, forestry, and land-use practices can also contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, and reducing emissions from these sectors requires the development of sustainable agricultural practices, reforestation, and conservation.\n\n**Industry**\n\nIndustry is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, and reducing emissions from industry requires the development of low-carbon technologies and practices, such as carbon capture and storage.\n\n**Co-benefits**\n\nClimate change mitigation can also provide co-benefits, including employment and economic development, energy security, health and well-being, and climate change adaptation.\n\n**Employment and economic development**\n\nClimate change mitigation can provide employment and economic development opportunities in the clean energy sector, sustainable agriculture, and other low-carbon industries.\n\n**Energy security**\n\nClimate change mitigation can also improve energy security by reducing dependence on fossil fuels and promoting the development of low-carbon energy sources.\n\n**Health and well-being**\n\nClimate change mitigation can also improve health and well-being by reducing air pollution and promoting sustainable land-use practices.\n\n**Climate change adaptation**\n\nClimate change adaptation is also an essential component of climate change mitigation, as it involves the development of strategies and practices to reduce the impacts of climate change.\n\n**Negative side effects**\n\nClimate change mitigation can also have negative side effects, such as job losses in the fossil fuel industry, increased costs for consumers, and potential impacts on the economy.\n\n**Costs and funding**\n\nThe costs of climate change mitigation can be significant, and funding is often a major challenge. However, there are also potential benefits and avoided costs, such as reduced healthcare costs and avoided climate change impacts.\n\n**Avoided costs of climate change effects**\n\nThe avoided costs of climate change effects can also be significant, including reduced healthcare costs, avoided economic losses, and other benefits.\n\n**Distributing emissions abatement costs**\n\nDistributing emissions abatement costs can be challenging, and various approaches, such as carbon pricing and clean technology subsidies, can be used to promote climate change mitigation.\n\n**Funding**\n\nFunding for climate change mitigation can come from various sources, including government funding, private sector investment, and international cooperation.\n\n**Policies**\n\nPolicies can play a critical role in promoting climate change mitigation, including national policies, international agreements, and economic incentives.\n\n**National policies**\n\nNational policies can include carbon pricing, clean energy targets, and energy efficiency standards.\n\n### Carbon pricing\n\nCarbon pricing can be an effective tool for promoting climate change mitigation, as it provides a financial incentive for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n**International agreements**\n\nInternational agreements, such as the Paris Agreement, can also promote climate change mitigation by establishing common goals and guidelines for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n### Paris Agreement\n\nThe Paris Agreement is a critical international agreement for promoting climate change mitigation, as it establishes a global goal of limiting warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.\n\n**History**\n\nThe history of climate change mitigation dates back to the 1970s, when the first climate change policies were developed. Since then, climate change mitigation has become a major global priority.\n\n**Society and culture**\n\nClimate change mitigation has also had a significant impact on society and culture, including changes in consumer behavior, lifestyle changes, and the development of new technologies.\n\n**Commitments to divest**\n\nClimate change mitigation has also led to a divestment movement, as individuals and organizations seek to withdraw investments from fossil fuel companies and invest in clean energy.\n\n**Barriers**\n\nDespite the importance of climate change mitigation, there are still significant barriers, including lack of awareness, lack of funding, and lack of policy support.\n\n**Impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic**\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also had a significant impact on climate change mitigation, including the development of new clean energy technologies and the promotion of remote work.\n\n**Examples by country**\n\nClimate change mitigation efforts vary by country, but some examples include the United States, China, and the European Union.\n\n**United States**\n\nThe United States has a long history of climate change mitigation efforts, including the development of clean energy technologies and the promotion of energy efficiency.\n\n**China**\n\nChina has also been a leader in climate change mitigation efforts, including the development of clean energy technologies and the promotion of energy efficiency.\n\n**European Union**\n\nThe European Union has also been a leader in climate change mitigation efforts, including the development of clean energy technologies and the promotion of energy efficiency.\n\n**See also**\n\nClimate change mitigation is a global priority, and there are many other topics related to climate change mitigation, including climate change adaptation, climate change impacts, and climate change policy.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The system used can vary depending on the type of climbing, region, and personal preference. This article provides an overview of the various grading systems used in climbing.\n\n**History**\n------------\n\nThe concept of grading rock climbing routes dates back to the early 20th century. The first attempt at creating a grading system was made by the British Mountaineering Council (BMC) in 1950. The BMC introduced the V-grade system, which is still used today. However, other grading systems have also been developed over the years, including the French numerical grade, American YDS grade, and UIAA scale.\n\n**Free climbing**\n----------------\n\nFree climbing is a type of climbing that involves ascending a rock face using only the hands, feet, and body. The grades for free climbing routes are typically determined by the difficulty of the route, including the level of physical exertion required and the level of technical difficulty involved.\n\n### French numerical grade\n\nThe French numerical grade is a widely used grading system in which the difficulty of a route is expressed as a number from 1 to 9. The grades are:\n\n* 1: Easy\n* 2: Very easy\n* 3: Easy to moderate\n* 4: Moderate\n* 5: Difficult\n* 6: Very difficult\n* 7: Extremely difficult\n* 8: Extremely difficult and physically demanding\n* 9: Extremely difficult and physically demanding, with a high level of technical difficulty\n\n### American YDS grade\n\nThe American YDS (Yosemite Decimal System) grade is another widely used grading system in the United States. The grades are:\n\n* Class 1: Easy, non-technical routes\n* Class 2: Easy to moderate, non-technical routes\n* Class 3: Moderate, technical routes\n* Class 4: Difficult, technical routes\n* Class 5: Very difficult, technical routes\n* Class 5.0: Extremely difficult, technical routes\n* Class 5.1-5.9: Extremely difficult, technical routes, with a high level of physical exertion required\n\n### UIAA scale\n\nThe UIAA (Union of International Alpine Associations) scale is a grading system used by the International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC). The grades are:\n\n* UIAA I: Easy\n* UIAA II: Easy to moderate\n* UIAA III: Moderate\n* UIAA IV: Difficult\n* UIAA V: Very difficult\n* UIAA VI: Extremely difficult\n* UIAA VII: Extremely difficult and physically demanding\n\n### British E-grade\n\nThe British E-grade system is used in the United Kingdom and is based on the French numerical grade system. The grades are:\n\n* E1: Easy\n* E2: Very easy\n* E3: Easy to moderate\n* E4: Moderate\n* E5: Difficult\n* E6: Very difficult\n* E7: Extremely difficult\n* E8: Extremely difficult and physically demanding\n* E9: Extremely difficult and physically demanding, with a high level of technical difficulty\n\n### Other notable systems\n\nOther notable grading systems include the Australian grading system, which uses a numerical grade from 1 to 8, and the Swedish grading system, which uses a numerical grade from 1 to 10.\n\n**Bouldering**\n----------------\n\nBouldering is a type of climbing that involves ascending short, lower-level rock formations without the use of ropes or harnesses. The grades for bouldering routes are typically determined by the difficulty of the route, including the level of physical exertion required and the level of technical difficulty involved.\n\n### Comparison with free climbing\n\nBouldering grades are often compared to free climbing grades, but the two systems are not directly equivalent. Bouldering grades tend to be lower than free climbing grades, as bouldering routes are typically shorter and easier than free climbing routes.\n\n### Font grade\n\nThe Font grade is a grading system used in bouldering and is based on the French numerical grade system. The grades are:\n\n* Font 2: Easy\n* Font 3: Very easy\n* Font 4: Easy to moderate\n* Font 5: Moderate\n* Font 6: Difficult\n* Font 7: Very difficult\n* Font 8: Extremely difficult\n* Font 9: Extremely difficult and physically demanding\n\n### V-grade\n\nThe V-grade is a grading system used in bouldering and is based on the French numerical grade system. The grades are:\n\n* V0: Easy\n* V0+: Very easy\n* V1: Easy to moderate\n* V2: Moderate\n* V3: Difficult\n* V4: Very difficult\n* V5: Extremely difficult\n* V6: Extremely difficult and physically demanding\n* V7: Extremely difficult and physically demanding, with a high level of technical difficulty\n\n### Other notable systems\n\nOther notable bouldering grading systems include the Australian grading system, which uses a numerical grade from 1 to 8, and the Japanese grading system, which uses a numerical grade from 1 to 10.\n\n**Aid climbing**\n----------------\n\nAid climbing is a type of climbing that involves ascending a rock face by using equipment such as ladders, hooks, and cams to support the climber. The grades for aid climbing routes are typically determined by the difficulty of the route, including the level of physical exertion required and the level of technical difficulty involved.\n\n### Instability of aid grades\n\nThe grades for aid climbing routes are often unstable and can vary depending on the climber's experience and the conditions of the route.\n\n### Original A-grade\n\nThe original A-grade system was developed by the American Alpine Club (AAC) and is based on a numerical grade from 1 to 5. The grades are:\n\n* A1: Easy\n* A2: Moderate\n* A3: Difficult\n* A4: Very difficult\n* A5: Extremely difficult\n\n### New wave A-grade\n\nThe new wave A-grade system is a more recent system developed by the AAC and is based on a numerical grade from 1 to 4. The grades are:\n\n* A1: Easy\n* A2: Moderate\n* A3: Difficult\n* A4: Extremely difficult\n\n### Clean C-grade\n\nThe clean C-grade system is a more recent system developed by the AAC and is based on a numerical grade from 1 to 3. The grades are:\n\n* C1: Easy\n* C2: Moderate\n* C3: Difficult\n\n**Ice and mixed climbing**\n-------------------------\n\nIce climbing and mixed climbing involve ascending ice formations and rock formations that are covered in ice. The grades for ice and mixed climbing routes are typically determined by the difficulty of the route, including the level of physical exertion required and the level of technical difficulty involved.\n\n### WI-grade\n\nThe WI-grade system is a grading system used in ice climbing and is based on a numerical grade from 1 to 5. The grades are:\n\n* WI1: Easy\n* WI2: Moderate\n* WI3: Difficult\n* WI4: Very difficult\n* WI5: Extremely difficult\n\n### M-grade\n\nThe M-grade system is a grading system used in mixed climbing and is based on a numerical grade from 1 to 5.

These storms can bring catastrophic winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surges that can cause significant damage and loss of life. In 2023, tropical cyclones affected various regions around the world, including the North Atlantic, Eastern and Central Pacific, Western Pacific, North Indian, South-West Indian, Australian, South Pacific, and South Atlantic oceans.\n\n**Global Atmospheric and Hydrological Conditions**\n\nThe 2023 tropical cyclone season was influenced by various global atmospheric and hydrological conditions. El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) was in a neutral phase for most of the year, which led to a relatively normal Atlantic hurricane season. However, the Pacific Ocean experienced an La Niña event, which contributed to a more active hurricane season in the Eastern and Central Pacific.\n\n**Summary**\n\nThe 2023 tropical cyclone season was marked by a mix of activity in various regions. Some notable events include:\n\n* The North Atlantic Ocean experienced a relatively quiet season, with only 10 named storms.\n* The Eastern and Central Pacific Ocean saw an above-average season, with 19 named storms.\n* The Western Pacific Ocean was active, with 28 named storms.\n* The North Indian Ocean experienced a below-average season, with only 5 named storms.\n* The South-West Indian Ocean had a relatively quiet season, with only 6 named storms.\n\n**Regional Breakdown**\n\n### North Atlantic Ocean\n\nThe North Atlantic Ocean experienced a relatively quiet season, with only 10 named storms.

The program has since undergone several iterations, with multiple prototype designs and test flights. The current Starship design is a stainless steel spacecraft with a diameter of 9 meters (30 feet) and a height of 50 meters (164 feet).\n\n### **Opinions before launch**\n\nBefore the flight test, there was significant interest and anticipation among space enthusiasts and industry experts. Some experts expressed concerns about the safety and reliability of the spacecraft, while others were optimistic about its potential. On social media and online forums, there was a heated debate about the chances of success and the potential risks involved.\n\n### **Test objectives**\n\nThe primary objective of the Starship flight test 1 was to test the spacecraft's ability to reach orbit and return to Earth safely. The test also aimed to evaluate the performance of the Raptor engine, the spacecraft's guidance and navigation system, and the overall flight dynamics of the spacecraft.\n\n**Launch**\n\n### **Flight profile**\n\nThe Starship flight test 1 was launched from the SpaceX facility in Boca Chica, Texas, on March 30, 2023. The spacecraft was carried to an altitude of 20 kilometers (12 miles) by a booster rocket before releasing the Raptor engine and ascending to an altitude of 63 kilometers (40 miles). The spacecraft then returned to Earth, landing safely in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n### **Flight timeline**\n\nThe flight timeline of the Starship flight test 1 was as follows:\n\n* 10:00 AM CST: Booster rocket lifts off from the launchpad\n* 10:30 AM CST: Raptor engine ignites and propels the spacecraft to an altitude of 20 kilometers (12 miles)\n* 11:00 AM CST: Spacecraft releases the booster rocket and continues ascending to an altitude of 63 kilometers (40 miles)\n* 11:30 AM CST: Spacecraft begins its descent and returns to Earth\n* 12:00 PM CST: Spacecraft lands safely in the Gulf of Mexico\n\n### **April 17, 2023 attempt**\n\nOn April 17, 2023, SpaceX attempted to launch the Starship again, but the flight was aborted due to a technical issue with the Raptor engine.\n\n### **April 20, 2023, 2nd attempt**\n\nOn April 20, 2023, SpaceX launched the Starship for the second time, but the flight was also aborted due to a technical issue with the spacecraft's guidance and navigation system.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\n### **Technical assessments**\n\nThe Starship flight test 1 provided valuable insights into the performance of the Raptor engine, the spacecraft's guidance and navigation system, and the overall flight dynamics of the spacecraft. The test also highlighted several technical issues that need to be addressed before the spacecraft can be considered safe for human transportation.\n\n### **Launch site**\n\nThe Starship launch site in Boca Chica, Texas, has been the focus of significant attention and investment by SpaceX. The site has been upgraded to accommodate the Starship program, with the addition of new launchpads, infrastructure, and personnel.\n\n### **Effects on environment**\n\nThe Starship flight test 1 had a minimal impact on the environment, with no reported damage to nearby properties or wildlife.\n\n### **FAA investigation**\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has launched an investigation into the Starship flight test 1, focusing on the technical issues that led to the flight being aborted. The investigation is ongoing and is expected to take several months to complete.\n\n**See also**\n\n* SpaceX Starship\n* Raptor engine\n* Boca Chica launch site\n* Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)\n* Elon Musk\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The Starship flight test 1 was a significant event in the development of the spacecraft and marked a major milestone in the program's history.\n* The test provided valuable insights into the performance of the Raptor engine and the spacecraft's guidance and navigation system.\n* The Starship program is ongoing, with multiple test flights scheduled in the coming months.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

Born Anna Mae Bullock on November 26, 1939, in Nutbush, Tennessee, Turner rose to fame in the 1960s as the lead singer of the Ike & Tina Turner Revue, a popular musical duo. After a tumultuous marriage to her manager and husband Ike Turner, Tina Turner embarked on a successful solo career, becoming one of the best-selling artists of all time.\n\n**#Early life**\n\nTina Turner was born in Nutbush, Tennessee, a small rural town near Memphis, to Zelma Bullock, a housemaid, and Floyd Bullock, a sharecropper. She was the youngest of three children, with an older sister, Alline, and an older brother, Raymond. Turner's family was impoverished, and she grew up in a small shack without electricity or indoor plumbing.\n\nGrowing up in a poor household, Turner's early life was marked by hardship and struggle. Her parents, who were devout Pentecostals, instilled in her a strong sense of spirituality and a love of music. Turner's mother, Zelma, was a talented singer who introduced her to gospel music, while her father, Floyd, played the guitar and taught Turner how to sing and dance.\n\n**#Ike and Tina Turner**\n\n### **Origins: 1956–1960**\n\nTina Turner's music career began in 1956 when she met Ike Turner, a successful musician and bandleader, at the Tunica Club in St. Louis, Missouri. Turner was 17 years old at the time, and Ike was 26. Ike was immediately drawn to Turner's powerful voice and energetic stage presence, and he convinced her to join his band as a backing singer.\n\n### **Early success: 1960–1965**\n\nTina Turner and Ike Turner began performing together in 1960, and their music career quickly took off. They released their first single, \"A Fool in Love,\" in 1960, which became a local hit. Over the next few years, they achieved national success with hits like \"It's Gonna Work Out Fine\" and \"Good Golly Miss Molly.\"\n\n### **Mainstream success: 1966–1975**\n\nIn 1966, Tina Turner and Ike Turner released \"River Deep – Mountain High,\" a song that became a huge hit and cemented their status as one of the most popular musical duos of the time. Over the next few years, they released a string of successful albums and singles, including \"Proud Mary,\" \"Nutbush City Limits,\" and \"I Want to Take You Higher.\"\n\n### **Split: 1976**\n\nIn 1976, Tina Turner and Ike Turner's marriage began to unravel. Turner had become increasingly frustrated with Ike's controlling behavior and his relentless pursuit of fame and fortune. The tension between them came to a head in 1976, when Turner left Ike and filed for divorce.\n\n**#Solo career**\n\n### **Early solo career: 1976–1982**\n\nAfter leaving Ike Turner, Tina Turner launched a successful solo career, releasing her debut album, \"Tina Turns the Country On!\", in 1974. However, it was her second album, \"Tina Live in Paris\" (1978), that brought her first major success as a solo artist.\n\n### **Career resurgence and superstardom: 1983–2000**\n\nIn 1983, Turner released her breakthrough album, \"Private Dancer,\" which sold over 10 million copies worldwide. The album included hits like \"What's Love Got to Do with It\" and \"Better Be Good to Me.\" Over the next few years, Turner released a string of successful albums and singles, including \"Foreign Affair\" (1989) and \"The Best\" (1993).\n\n### **Later career: 2001–2021**\n\nIn 2001, Turner released her first live album in 10 years, \"Tina: Live in Concert,\" which marked a new chapter in her career. She continued to tour and perform, releasing her final studio album, \"Tina,\" in 2013.\n\n**#Personal life**\n\n### **Relationships and marriages**\n\nTurner has been married twice, first to Ike Turner from 1962 to 1976, and then to German music executive Erwin Bach from 2013 to 2023.\n\n### **Children**\n\nTurner does not have any children of her own, but she has been a mother figure to many of her fans and protégés throughout her career.\n\n### **Religious beliefs**\n\nTurner has always been a devout Christian, and her faith has played a significant role in her life and music.\n\n### **Residences, citizenship, and wealth**\n\nTurner is a Swiss citizen and has lived in Switzerland for many years.

It is the latest mainline installment in the Sonic the Hedgehog series, following Sonic Mania Plus (2018) and Sonic Forces (2017). The game was released worldwide on November 8, 2022, for PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch.\n\n**Gameplay**\n\nThe gameplay of Sonic Frontiers is centered around exploration, platforming, and combat. Players control Sonic as he navigates through various islands, each with its unique layout, terrain, and set of challenges. The game features a non-linear open-world design, allowing players to choose their own path and approach to completing objectives.\n\nOne of the key features of Sonic Frontiers is its \"Starfall\" system, which enables players to collect and combine stars to unlock new abilities, upgrade Sonic's stats, and access new areas. The game also introduces a new \"Sonic Forces\" style of combat, where players can use Sonic's abilities to take down enemies and bosses in a variety of creative ways.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe plot of Sonic Frontiers revolves around Sonic's quest to save the world from the return of the Death Egg, a powerful enemy from the Sonic series. The story is told through a series of cutscenes and conversations between Sonic and other characters, including Tails, Amy, and Knuckles.\n\n**Another Story**\n\nIn addition to the main storyline, Sonic Frontiers features a series of side quests and challenges known as \"Another Story.\" These additional storylines offer a deeper look into the characters and their motivations, and provide players with a chance to explore new areas and encounter new enemies.\n\n**Development**\n\n**Conception**\n\nThe idea for Sonic Frontiers began several years ago, when Sega and Sonic Team started brainstorming ideas for a new Sonic game. The team wanted to create a game that would showcase Sonic's speed and agility, while also introducing new elements and gameplay mechanics.\n\n**Design**\n\nThe design of Sonic Frontiers was led by Takashi Iizuka, a veteran Sonic Team developer who has worked on several Sonic games. Iizuka wanted to create a game that would appeal to both old and new fans of the series, and that would offer a fresh take on the classic Sonic formula.\n\n**Writing**\n\nThe writing of Sonic Frontiers was handled by a team of writers who have worked on previous Sonic games. The team aimed to create a story that would be both engaging and faithful to the Sonic universe, while also introducing new characters and plot twists.\n\n**Music**\n\nThe music of Sonic Frontiers was composed by Tomoya Ohtani, a renowned video game composer who has worked on several Sonic games. The soundtrack features a mix of electronic and rock elements, and is designed to be both catchy and energetic.\n\n**Marketing and release**\n\nSonic Frontiers was announced in June 2022, with a trailer showcasing the game's fast-paced gameplay and colorful graphics. The game was released on November 8, 2022, for PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch.\n\n**Reception**\n\n**Pre-release**\n\nBefore its release, Sonic Frontiers received a mixed response from fans and critics. Some praised the game's fast-paced gameplay and colorful graphics, while others expressed concerns about the game's open-world design and lack of innovation.\n\n**Post-release**\n\nAfter its release, Sonic Frontiers received generally positive reviews from critics and fans. The game's open-world design and Starfall system were praised for their creativity and depth, while the game's combat and exploration mechanics were also well-received.\n\n**Sales**\n\nSonic Frontiers has been a commercial success, with Sega announcing that the game has sold over 2 million copies worldwide. The game's sales have been driven by its strong critical reception and the popularity of the Sonic franchise.\n\n**Accolades**\n\nSonic Frontiers has received several awards and nominations, including Best Platformer at the 2022 Golden Joystick Awards and Best Visual Design at the 2022 Game Awards. The game has also been praised for its faithfulness to the Sonic franchise and its innovative gameplay mechanics.\n\n**Notes**\n\nSonic Frontiers is the latest installment in the Sonic the Hedgehog series, and is a significant departure from the series' traditional formula. The game's open-world design and Starfall system offer a fresh take on the classic Sonic gameplay, and the game's colorful graphics and catchy soundtrack make it a visually stunning experience.\n\n**References**\n\nThis article is written based on publicly available information and does not contain any citations or references.\n\n**External links**\n\n* Official Sonic Frontiers website\n* Sonic Frontiers on Steam\n* Sonic Frontiers on PlayStation Store\n* Sonic Frontiers on Xbox Store\n* Sonic Frontiers on Nintendo eShop", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

This movement has its roots in the Reformation and has evolved over the centuries, influencing various Protestant denominations and theological traditions.\n\nHistory and Main Leaders\n\nReformed fundamentalism emerged in the early 20th century as a response to what its adherents perceived as the liberalization of mainstream Christianity. Key figures in the development of this movement include Carl McIntire, a Presbyterian pastor and theologian who founded the Bible Presbyterian Church, and Robert G. Rayburn, a Presbyterian minister who played a significant role in shaping the theology of the Presbyterian Church in America.\n\nTheological Distinctives\n\nReformed fundamentalism is characterized by several distinct theological emphases. These include:\n\nBroader Conservative Evangelicalism\n\nPertaining to Salvation and the Gospel\n\nReformed fundamentalists emphasize the importance of justification by faith alone, the centrality of the cross, and the authority of Scripture in understanding the gospel. They reject what they see as the compromise of liberal theology on these matters, advocating instead for a more traditional and Reformed understanding of salvation.\n\nOther Fundamental Protestant and Biblical Theology\n\nReformed fundamentalists also emphasize the importance of Reformed theology, including the sovereignty of God, the total depravity of man, and the perseverance of the saints. They affirm the authority of the Westminster Confession of Faith and the other Reformed confessions.\n\nThe Inspiration and Preservation of the Scriptures\n\nVerbal Plenary Inspiration\n\nReformed fundamentalists believe in the verbal plenary inspiration of Scripture, which holds that every word of the Bible is inspired by God and therefore authoritative and inerrant.\n\nPreservation of the Texts of Scripture\n\nReformed fundamentalists emphasize the importance of the preservation of the original texts of Scripture, which they believe have been accurately transmitted through the centuries. They reject what they see as the corruption of the text through transmission and translation, advocating instead for the use of the most reliable and oldest manuscripts available.\n\nCommon Principles of Reformation Evangelical Interpretation and Private Reading\n\nReformed fundamentalists emphasize the importance of private reading and interpretation of Scripture, rejecting what they see as the over-reliance on tradition and the authority of the church.\n\nThe Classical Creeds and Reformational Confessions\n\nReformed fundamentalists affirm the authority of the classical creeds and the Reformed confessions, including the Apostles' Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Westminster Confession of Faith.\n\nCongregational Practices\n\nReformed fundamentalist congregations typically emphasize the importance of:\n\n* The ordinances of baptism and the Lord's Supper, which are seen as sacraments\n* The authority of Scripture in all matters of faith and practice\n* The importance of the Reformed confessions and the classical creeds\n* The role of the church as a community of believers\n\nBible Translation and Usage\n\nThe Authorized Version Tradition, the Byzantine Received Text, and Eastern (Greek) and Western (Greco-Latin) Ecclesiastical Translation Traditions\n\nReformed fundamentalists have traditionally been associated with the Authorized Version (KJV), which they see as the most reliable and accurate translation of the Bible available. They emphasize the importance of the Byzantine Received Text, which is seen as the most reliable and oldest manuscript tradition available. They reject what they see as the corruption of the text through transmission and translation, advocating instead for the use of the most reliable and oldest manuscripts available.\n\nModern Versions, Denominational Preferences and Translation Controversies\n\nReformed fundamentalists have been critical of modern translations of the Bible, which they see as compromising the authority and inerrancy of Scripture. They have been particularly critical of the New International Version (NIV) and the New American Standard Bible (NASB), which they see as weak on doctrine and lacking in biblical accuracy. They advocate for the use of the most reliable and traditional translations available, such as the KJV and the NKJV.\n\nEvangelical and Missional Apologetics\n\nBible Apologetics\n\nReformed fundamentalists emphasize the importance of apologetics, which is seen as the defense of the faith against the attacks of liberalism, modernism, and secularism. They advocate for a biblical and Reformed understanding of apologetics, which emphasizes the authority and inerrancy of Scripture and the importance of the classical creeds and Reformed confessions.\n\nLiberal-Modernist Challenge to Verbal Inspiration and Truthfulness of Scripture\n\nReformed fundamentalists have been critical of liberal and modernist theology, which they see as compromising the authority and inerrancy of Scripture. They have been particularly critical of the views of theologians such as Karl Barth and Rudolf Bultmann, who they see as undermining the authority of Scripture and promoting a liberal and modernist theology.\n\nModern Biblical Criticism\n\nReformed fundamentalists have been critical of modern biblical criticism, which they see as compromising the authority and inerrancy of Scripture. They have been particularly critical of the views of scholars such as Richard Dawkins and Bart Ehrman, who they see as promoting a liberal and modernist theology.\n\nModern Western Society and Intellectual Unbelief\n\nCriticism of New-Neo Evangelicalism and the 'Present Downgrade'\n\nReformed fundamentalists have been critical of what they see as the compromising of evangelical theology and practice, particularly in the areas of dispensationalism and charismaticism. They advocate for a more traditional and Reformed understanding of theology and practice.\n\nMaterialist and Naturalist Unbelief, and Historic Adamism and Creationism\n\nReformed fundamentalists emphasize the importance of a biblical and Reformed understanding of creation and the nature of man, which they see as being compromised by modernist and naturalist views. They advocate for a traditional and Reformed understanding of creation and the nature of man, which emphasizes the authority and inerrancy of Scripture.\n\nSee Also\n\n* Fundamentalism\n* Reformed theology\n* Conservative evangelicalism\n* Bible Presbyterian Church\n* Presbyterian Church in America\n* Westminster Confession of Faith\n\nResources\n\n* McIntire, C.

The country's unique geography, rich history, and diverse culture make it a fascinating and complex nation. This article provides an overview of Turkey's etymology, history, administrative divisions, government and politics, geography, economy, demographics, culture, and more.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe name \"Turkey\" is derived from the Middle English term \"Turke,\" which referred to the Turkic peoples who migrated from Central Asia to Anatolia (modern-day Turkey) in the 11th century. The name was later adopted as the official name of the country. The Turkish language, spoken by over 70 million people, is a member of the Oghuz branch of the Turkic language family.\n\n**History**\n\n#### Prehistory and ancient history\n\nThe earliest human habitation in Turkey dates back to the Paleolithic era, around 8,000 BCE.

The Greeks also had a significant presence in the region, establishing colonies and trading posts along the coast.\n\n#### Early classical antiquity\n\nIn the 8th century BCE, the Ionian Greeks established the city of Miletus, which became a major center of culture and trade. The Persian Empire conquered the region in the 6th century BCE, and the Persians built roads, bridges, and other infrastructure. The ancient Greeks later recaptured the region and established the city of Antioch, which became a major center of early Christianity.\n\n#### Rome and Byzantine Empire\n\nThe Romans conquered the region in 133 BCE, and it became a province of the Roman Empire. The Byzantine Empire, also known as the Eastern Roman Empire, was established in 330 CE and lasted until the 15th century.

The Ottomans expanded rapidly and conquered much of the Middle East, North Africa, and Eastern Europe. At its peak, the Ottoman Empire was one of the largest empires in history. The Ottomans introduced Islam to Europe and played a significant role in shaping European culture and politics.\n\n#### Republic of Türkiye\n\nThe modern Republic of Türkiye was founded in 1923 by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, a Turkish nationalist leader. Atatürk introduced a series of reforms aimed at modernizing the country, including the adoption of a secular constitution, the abolition of the caliphate, and the introduction of women's suffrage.

He is often regarded as one of the greatest philosophers in the ancient Greek tradition, and his ideas have had a profound impact on Western philosophy. Heraclitus' philosophical views on the nature of reality, the human condition, and the role of reason and knowledge are still widely studied and debated today.\n\n**Life**\n\nLittle is known about Heraclitus' life, and much of what we know comes from ancient sources such as Diogenes Laertius and Strabo. Heraclitus was born into a noble family in Ephesus, which was a major city in the ancient Ionian Greek world. He is said to have spent most of his life in Ephesus, where he developed his philosophical ideas and wrote his famous book, \"On Nature\".\n\n**On Nature**\n\n\"On Nature\" is Heraclitus' only surviving work, and it is a philosophical treatise that explores the nature of reality, the human condition, and the role of reason and knowledge. The book is written in a unique and enigmatic style, which has been interpreted in many different ways over the centuries.\n\n### Structure\n\n\"On Nature\" is a collection of aphorisms, each of which is a short, pithy statement that explores a particular idea or theme. The book is divided into several sections, each of which deals with a different aspect of reality and human experience.\n\n### Style\n\nHeraclitus' writing style is characterized by its use of paradox, metaphor, and other literary devices. He often uses imagery and symbolism to convey complex ideas and emotions, and his writing is notable for its beauty and elegance.\n\n#### The Obscure\n\nOne of the most distinctive features of Heraclitus' writing style is its obscurity. Many of his aphorisms are cryptic and open to multiple interpretations, which has led to a wide range of different interpretations and understandings of his ideas. This obscurity has been both praised and criticized over the centuries, with some readers admiring Heraclitus' subtlety and others finding his writing frustratingly unclear.\n\n**Philosophy**\n\nHeraclitus' philosophy is centered around several key ideas, including the unity of opposites and the concept of flux.\n\n### Unity of opposites and flux\n\nHeraclitus believed that the fundamental nature of reality is to be found in the unity of opposites, such as hot and cold, wet and dry, and so on. He saw these opposites as interconnected and interdependent, and he believed that they were constantly in a state of flux, with each being constantly transforming into the other.\n\n#### Panta rhei\n\nOne of Heraclitus' most famous aphorisms is \"Panta rhei\", or \"everything flows\".

The storm brought severe weather conditions to several Caribbean islands and the eastern United States, causing widespread damage and disruption.\n\n# Meteorological history\n\nHurricane Idalia formed on August 15, 2023, as a tropical depression in the eastern Atlantic Ocean. The system was located approximately 1,000 miles (1,600 km) west of the Cape Verde Islands, a group of islands off the coast of West Africa. At the time, the depression was characterized by a circulation of low-pressure air, with maximum sustained winds of 35 mph (55 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 1008 mbar.\n\nOver the next few days, the depression strengthened into a tropical storm, with the National Hurricane Center (NHC) assigning the name Idalia on August 17. The storm continued to intensify, and by August 20, Idalia had become a hurricane, with maximum sustained winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 985 mbar.\n\nIdalia's trajectory took the storm westward across the Caribbean, with the NHC predicting a potential threat to the Florida Keys and the Gulf Coast of the United States. The storm continued to intensify, and by August 22, Idalia had become a Category 4 hurricane, with maximum sustained winds of 140 mph (220 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 950 mbar.\n\n# Preparations\n\n## Cuba\n\nAs Idalia approached the Caribbean, Cuban authorities issued a hurricane watch for several provinces, including Pinar del Río, Artemisa, and Mayabeque. The Cuban Meteorological Institute issued a tropical storm warning for the entire island, with the storm expected to bring heavy rain, strong winds, and storm surges.\n\n## United States\n\n### Florida\n\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency on August 21, as Idalia's trajectory took the storm westward across the state. The National Guard was deployed to assist with evacuations and emergency response efforts. Florida residents were advised to prepare for power outages, flooding, and property damage.\n\n### Elsewhere\n\nResidents in other parts of the United States, including the Gulf Coast and the Southeast, were also advised to prepare for potential hurricane impacts. The NHC issued a hurricane watch for several counties in Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana, with the storm expected to bring heavy rain, strong winds, and storm surges.\n\n## Bermuda\n\nResidents in Bermuda were advised to prepare for potential hurricane impacts, with the NHC issuing a tropical storm warning for the island. Bermuda's Emergency Measures Organisation (EMO) activated its emergency response plan, with the military and emergency services on standby to assist with evacuations and emergency response efforts.\n\n# Impact\n\n## Caribbean\n\nIdalia made landfall on the western tip of Cuba on August 22, bringing heavy rain, strong winds, and storm surges to several provinces. The storm caused widespread damage, with reports of power outages, flooding, and property damage.\n\n## United States\n\n### Florida\n\nIdalia made landfall on the west coast of Florida on August 23, bringing heavy rain, strong winds, and storm surges to several counties. The storm caused widespread damage, with reports of power outages, flooding, and property damage.\n\n### Georgia\n\nResidents in southern Georgia were affected by Idalia's outer rain bands, with reports of heavy rain, strong winds, and storm surges. The city of Brunswick was particularly hard hit, with reports of power outages, flooding, and property damage.\n\n### South Carolina\n\nResidents in eastern South Carolina were affected by Idalia's outer rain bands, with reports of heavy rain, strong winds, and storm surges. The city of Charleston was particularly hard hit, with reports of power outages, flooding, and property damage.\n\n### North Carolina\n\nResidents in eastern North Carolina were affected by Idalia's outer rain bands, with reports of heavy rain, strong winds, and storm surges.

The storm caused widespread damage, with reports of power outages, flooding, and property damage.\n\n# Aftermath\n\n## United States\n\n### Florida\n\nFlorida residents were left to deal with the aftermath of Idalia's destructive path, with reports of widespread property damage, power outages, and flooding. The state's Emergency Management Division was activated to assist with response and recovery efforts.\n\n### Georgia\n\nResidents in southern Georgia were left to deal with the aftermath of Idalia's outer rain bands, with reports of widespread property damage, power outages, and flooding.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean\n* List of hurricanes in the Caribbean\n* List of hurricanes in the United States\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article contains information from the National Hurricane Center and the National Weather Service.\n\n# References\n\nThis article has no references.\n\n# External links\n\n* National Hurricane Center\n* National Weather Service\n* National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The group's formation is largely attributed to the reign of Roman Reigns as the top champion in the WWE, who began to gather around him a team of loyal allies and family members.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n### The Usos' feud with The Shield (2013–2014)\n\nThe Bloodline's predecessors, The Usos, first began to gain prominence in 2013 as a tag team. They were part of the Cenation, a faction established by The Shield, a group consisting of Seth Rollins, Dean Ambrose, and Roman Reigns. The Usos, however, eventually turned against The Shield and began a long-standing feud with the trio.\n\n### Occasional team-ups (2015–2020)\n\nIn 2015, The Usos reformed as a tag team and began to occasionally team up with Roman Reigns, who had by then become a top champion in the WWE. This marked the beginning of the Bloodline's formation, as Reigns and The Usos began to establish a bond that would eventually lead to the group's official formation.\n\n### Roman Reigns' leadership (2020–2024)\n\n#### Official Formation of The Bloodline (2020–2021)\n\nIn 2020, Roman Reigns officially formed the Bloodline, a group consisting of himself, his cousins The Usos, and his brothers-in-law The New Day. This marked a significant shift in the WWE, as the Bloodline became a dominant force in the promotion.\n\n#### All champions, rivalry with The New Day (2021–2022)\n\nIn 2021, the Bloodline added two new members, Paul Heyman and The New Day's Kofi Kingston, to their ranks. This marked a significant turning point in the group's history, as they became an unstoppable force in the WWE. The Bloodline's rivalry with The New Day was one of the most notable in the promotion, with the two groups engaging in a series of intense matches.\n\n#### Induction of Sami Zayn and Solo Sikoa (2022–2023)\n\nIn 2022, the Bloodline added two new members, Sami Zayn and Solo Sikoa. This marked a significant shift in the group's dynamics, as the Bloodline became a more diverse and inclusive group. The addition of Sami Zayn, a Canadian wrestler with a strong following, marked a significant departure from the group's traditional Samoan-American roots.\n\n#### Bloodline Civil War (2023)\n\nIn 2023, the Bloodline was plagued by internal conflicts, as Roman Reigns and Solo Sikoa engaged in a bitter feud. This marked a significant turning point in the group's history, as the Bloodline was forced to confront its own internal divisions.\n\n#### Addition of The Rock and feud with Cody Rhodes (2023–2024)\n\nIn 2023, the Bloodline added a new member, Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson, to their ranks. This marked a significant shift in the group's dynamics, as The Rock brought a level of charisma and star power to the group. The Bloodline's rivalry with Cody Rhodes, a rising star in the WWE, marked a significant turning point in the group's history.\n\n### Solo Sikoa's leadership (2024–present)\n\n#### Additions of The Tongans and Jacob Fatu (2024)\n\nIn 2024, the Bloodline added two new members, The Tongans and Jacob Fatu. This marked a significant shift in the group's dynamics, as the Bloodline became an even more diverse and inclusive group.\n\n#### Bloodline Civil War II (2024–present)\n\nIn 2024, the Bloodline was once again plagued by internal conflicts, as Solo Sikoa and Roman Reigns engaged in a bitter feud. This marked a significant turning point in the group's history, as the Bloodline was forced to confront its own internal divisions.\n\nMembers\n--------\n\n### Current\n\n* Roman Reigns\n* Solo Sikoa\n* The Usos (Jimmy and Jey Uso)\n* The Tongans (Drew and Joe Anoa'i)\n* Jacob Fatu\n\n### Former\n\n* Paul Heyman\n* Kofi Kingston\n* Sami Zayn\n\nTimeline\n--------\n\n* 2013: The Usos begin to gain prominence in the WWE.\n* 2015: The Usos reformed as a tag team and began to occasionally team up with Roman Reigns.\n* 2020: Roman Reigns officially formed the Bloodline.\n* 2021: The Bloodline added two new members, Paul Heyman and Kofi Kingston, to their ranks.\n* 2022: The Bloodline added two new members, Sami Zayn and Solo Sikoa, to their ranks.\n* 2023: The Bloodline was plagued by internal conflicts, as Roman Reigns and Solo Sikoa engaged in a bitter feud.\n* 2023: The Bloodline added a new member, Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson, to their ranks.\n* 2024: The Bloodline added two new members, The Tongans and Jacob Fatu, to their ranks.\n* 2024: The Bloodline was once again plagued by internal conflicts, as Solo Sikoa and Roman Reigns engaged in a bitter feud.\n\nSub-groups\n-----------\n\n### Current\n\n* The Usos\n* The New Day\n* The Tongans\n\n### Former\n\n* The Shield\n\nChampionships and accomplishments\n--------------------------------\n\n* Roman Reigns has held numerous championships, including the WWE Championship and the Universal Championship.\n* The Usos have held numerous championships, including the WWE Tag Team Championship.\n* The New Day has held numerous championships, including the WWE Tag Team Championship.\n* Solo Sikoa has held numerous championships, including the WWE Intercontinental Championship.\n* The Tongans have held numerous championships, including the WWE Tag Team Championship.\n\nOther media\n------------\n\n* The Bloodline has been featured on numerous WWE television shows, including Monday Night Raw and SmackDown.\n* The group has also been featured on WWE pay-per-view events, including WrestleMania and SummerSlam.\n\nSee also\n----------\n\n* Anoa'i wrestling family\n* WWE\n* Professional wrestling\n\nNotes\n------\n\n* This article is a comprehensive overview of the Bloodline's history and members.\n* The article includes information on the group's formation, members, and accomplishments.\n* The article also includes information on the group's internal conflicts and rivalries.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n* WWE\n\nExternal links\n----------------\n\n* WWE.com", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

This article provides a comprehensive overview of the background, incident, recovery operations, investigations, and aftermath of the tragedy.\n\n**Background**\n\n### OceanGate\n\nOceanGate Expeditions is a private company based in the United States that offers deep-sea submersible expeditions to various destinations, including the wreck of the RMS Titanic. The company was founded in 2009 and has since offered a range of expeditions, including tourism, research, and commercial dives.\n\n### Titanic\n\nThe RMS Titanic was a British passenger liner that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean in the early morning of April 15, 1912, after colliding with an iceberg during her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. The ship's wreckage was discovered on September 1, 1985, by a French-American expedition led by Dr. Robert Ballard. The wreck lies at a depth of approximately 12,500 feet (3,800 meters) in the North Atlantic Ocean.\n\n**Submersible Titan**\n\nThe Titan submersible was a deep-sea vessel operated by OceanGate Expeditions. The submersible was designed to carry five passengers and a pilot, and was capable of reaching depths of up to 12,500 feet (3,800 meters). The Titan was equipped with state-of-the-art communication and navigation systems, as well as a range of scientific instruments.\n\n### Dives to wreck of Titanic\n\nThe Titan submersible had conducted numerous dives to the wreck of the Titanic as part of OceanGate Expeditions' tourism and research programs. The submersible's pilot would guide the vessel to the wreck site, where passengers would have the opportunity to view the wreckage and conduct scientific research.\n\n### Safety\n\nOceanGate Expeditions and the Titan submersible were subject to strict safety regulations and guidelines. The company's vessels and equipment were regularly inspected and maintained to ensure compliance with industry standards. The company's pilots and crew were also trained and certified in emergency procedures, including evacuation and rescue protocols.\n\n### Prior concerns\n\nPrior to the incident, there were concerns raised about the safety of the Titan submersible and OceanGate Expeditions' operations. Some critics questioned the company's experience and expertise, as well as the safety record of its vessels and equipment.\n\n### Previous incidents\n\nOceanGate Expeditions had experienced several previous incidents, including a near-miss with a ship in 2019 and a reported issue with the company's communication systems in 2020. However, these incidents did not result in any fatalities or major damage.\n\n**Incident**\n\n### Expedition arrangements\n\nThe Titan submersible was scheduled to depart from the coastal town of St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada, on June 17, 2023, as part of a five-day expedition to the wreck of the Titanic. The expedition was expected to include a range of activities, including dives to the wreck site and scientific research.\n\n### 16–17 June preparations\n\nThe crew of the Titan submersible and OceanGate Expeditions' support team underwent extensive preparations for the expedition, including final checks on the submersible and its equipment.\n\n### 18 June, dive, disappearance, and implosion\n\nOn June 18, 2023, the Titan submersible departed from St. John's and headed to the wreck site of the Titanic. The submersible was scheduled to conduct a dive to the wreck site, where passengers would have the opportunity to view the wreckage. However, the submersible failed to return to the surface, and contact was lost with the vessel. A search and rescue operation was launched, and several hours later, it was confirmed that the submersible had imploded, resulting in the loss of five lives.\n\n### 18–22 June, search and rescue efforts\n\nA search and rescue operation was launched in the hours following the disappearance of the Titan submersible. The operation involved a range of vessels and aircraft, including the Canadian Coast Guard and the US Navy. The search area was extensive, covering several hundred square miles of ocean.\n\n### 22 June, discovery of debris\n\nOn June 22, 2023, debris from the Titan submersible was discovered in the search area. The debris was identified as coming from the submersible, and it was confirmed that the vessel had imploded.\n\n### Fatalities\n\nThe five crew members of the Titan submersible were killed in the incident. The victims were identified as:\n\n* Shahzada Dawood, a British businessman and philanthropist\n* Suleman Dawood, Shahzada's son\n* Hamish Harding, a British businessman and explorer\n* Paul-Henri Nargeolet, a French explorer and deep-sea diver\n* Stockton Rush, the pilot of the Titan submersible\n\n**Recovery operations**\n\nThe recovery of the Titan submersible and its crew was a complex and challenging operation. The wreckage of the submersible was located in a remote area of the ocean, and the conditions were difficult due to the rough sea and strong currents. A team of experts from the US Navy and other agencies was involved in the recovery operation, which took several days to complete.\n\n**Investigations**\n\n### United States\n\nThe US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) launched an investigation into the incident, which is ongoing. The NTSB is working with the US Coast Guard and other agencies to determine the cause of the implosion.\n\n### Canada\n\nThe Transportation Safety Board of Canada (TSB) also launched an investigation into the incident. The TSB is working with the US NTSB and other agencies to determine the cause of the implosion.\n\n**Lawsuit**\n\nA lawsuit has been filed on behalf of the families of the victims, alleging that OceanGate Expeditions and the US Navy were responsible for the deaths of the crew members.\n\n**Financial costs of operations**\n\nThe financial costs of the operation are significant, with estimates suggesting that the cost of the recovery operation alone could be in the millions of dollars.\n\n**Reactions**\n\nThe incident has sparked a range of reactions, including concern for the safety of deep-sea diving operations and questions about the regulations governing such activities. The incident has also raised concerns about the impact on the tourism industry and the potential consequences for OceanGate Expeditions.\n\n**In social and mass media**\n\nThe incident has been widely reported in the media, with many outlets highlighting the tragedy and the concerns about safety.
