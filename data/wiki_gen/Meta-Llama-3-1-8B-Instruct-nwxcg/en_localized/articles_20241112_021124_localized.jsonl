Despite their differences, Vikram and Saira form a bond, and Vikram becomes determined to help her.\n\nAs Vikram and Saira work together to overcome their respective challenges, they uncover a conspiracy involving a powerful businessman who is involved in human trafficking and arms smuggling. The businessman, who is revealed to be Vikram's brother-in-law, has been using his wealth and influence to exploit vulnerable people, including Saira.\n\nVikram and Saira embark on a mission to take down the businessman and bring him to justice.

It is contested by 18 clubs and is the country's highest level of domestic football competition, serving as the main qualifying route for the AFC Champions League.\n\n# History\n\n## Origins\n\nThe history of Liga 1 dates back to 1936, when the Dutch East Indies Football Federation (Voetbalbond van Nederlandsch-Indië) was established. The federation organized the first national football championship, which was won by Voetbal Bond N.I. (VBNI). After Indonesia gained independence in 1945, the Indonesian Football Federation (PSSI) was formed, and the national league was re-established.\n\n## Foundation\n\nThe modern Liga 1 was founded in 1994 as the Indonesian Premier League (IPL), with the aim of creating a more professional and competitive domestic football league. The league was initially plagued by financial and organizational problems, but it has since grown in popularity and stability.\n\n## Dualism\n\nIn 2008, the Indonesian government intervened in the league, introducing a new professional league called the Indonesia Super League (ISL). The ISL was designed to replace the existing IPL, but it co-existed with the old league for several years, creating a situation of dualism. The ISL eventually became the dominant league, and the IPL was dissolved in 2011.\n\n## Government intervention and FIFA suspension\n\nIn 2015, the Indonesian government again intervened in the league, this time imposing regulations that led to a dispute with FIFA. The regulations included restrictions on foreign players and a requirement for clubs to invest in infrastructure projects. FIFA suspended Indonesia from international competitions in response to the dispute, which lasted for several years.\n\n## Name change\n\nIn 2017, the league was rebranded as Liga 1, reflecting the country's growing football culture and the league's ambitions to become a major force in Asian football.\n\n# Competition format\n\n## Competition\n\nThe Liga 1 season typically runs from March to November, with 18 clubs competing in a double-round robin format. The league is divided into two rounds, with the top six teams in each round qualifying for the playoffs.\n\n## Promotion and relegation\n\nThe bottom three teams in the Liga 1 table are relegated to the Liga 2, while the top three teams in the Liga 2 are promoted to the Liga 1. This system has been in place since the 2015 season.\n\n## Video assistant referee\n\nSince the 2018 season, Liga 1 has introduced video assistant referees (VARs) to assist with match decisions.\n\n# Clubs\n\n## Champions\n\nThe following teams have won the Liga 1 title:\n\n1.

His relationship with his wife, Katherine \"Kitty\" Oppenheimer, becomes increasingly strained, and he begins to struggle with the moral implications of his work. Meanwhile, the project's secrecy and security measures create tension among the scientists and engineers involved.\n\nThe film's climax revolves around the Trinity test, the first nuclear test conducted by the United States on July 16, 1945.

This allows players and developers to modify and distribute the game freely, contributing to its development and community.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe concept of open-source software has been around for decades, but the idea of open-source video games is a more recent phenomenon. The rise of digital distribution platforms, the increasing power of personal computers, and the growing community of developers and players have all contributed to the growth of the open-source video game movement.\n\n**History**\n\n### Beginnings and early games\n\nThe first open-source video game is often credited to be _Adventure_ (1980), a text-based adventure game created by Warren Robinett. However, this game did not have a clear open-source license, and its source code was not widely available. One of the first games to explicitly release its source code under a free license was _Wolfenstein 3D_ (1992), a 3D first-person shooter developed by id Software. In 1995, id Software released the source code of _Wolfenstein 3D_ under the GNU General Public License (GPL), which allowed anyone to modify and distribute the game.\n\n### 3D games and source releases\n\nThe mid-to-late 1990s saw a surge in the number of open-source video games, particularly 3D games. Games like _Doom_ (1993) and _Quake_ (1996), also developed by id Software, were released with their source code under the GPL. This allowed developers to create modifications, or \"mods,\" that added new features, levels, and gameplay mechanics to these games. The source code releases also led to the creation of new games based on the id Software engines, such as _Xonotic_ (2005) and _Cube 2: Sauerbraten_ (2004).\n\n### Rise in popularity and diversity\n\nIn the 2000s, the open-source video game community continued to grow, with the creation of new games and the improvement of existing ones. The rise of open-source game engines, such as the Spring Engine (2002) and the Open Source Game Engine (2004), made it easier for developers to create and distribute games. This led to a diversification of genres, styles, and gameplay mechanics, as well as the creation of new communities and distributions.\n\n### Greater organization\n\nAs the open-source video game community grew, it became more organized, with the establishment of game development teams, forums, and websites. These communities provided a platform for developers to share knowledge, collaborate on projects, and distribute their games. Some notable examples of open-source game development teams include the _Open Source Game Development Team_ (OSGDT), the _Spring Game Development Team_ (SGDT), and the _Xonotic Project Team_ (XPT).\n\n### Hubs and development teams\n\nToday, the open-source video game community is more diverse and vibrant than ever, with hubs like the _Open Source Game Development Hub_ (OSG-DH), the _Spring Game Development Hub_ (SG-DH), and the _Xonotic Community Forum_ (XCF). These hubs bring together developers, players, and game enthusiasts from around the world, providing a platform for collaboration, knowledge-sharing, and community engagement.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Open-source software\n* Free and open-source software licensing\n* Game development\n* Game engine\n* Community-driven projects\n\n**External links**\n\n* Open Source Game Development Hub (OSG-DH)\n* Spring Game Development Hub (SG-DH)\n* Xonotic Community Forum (XCF)\n* Open Source Game Development Team (OSGDT)\n* Spring Game Development Team (SGDT)\n* Xonotic Project Team (XPT)", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

It is a complex and multifaceted philosophy that seeks to understand the nature of reality, the universe, and the human condition. Neoplatonism has had a profound impact on Western philosophy, influencing many fields of study, including theology, literature, art, and science.\n\n**Origins of the term**\n\nThe term \"Neoplatonism\" was coined in the 17th century to distinguish the philosophical movement from the original teachings of Plato. It is derived from the Greek words \"neos\" (νέος), meaning \"new,\" and \"Platonism\" (Πλατωνισμός), referring to the philosophical school founded by Plato. This distinction acknowledges the significant developments and modifications that occurred within the Platonic tradition over time.\n\n**Origins and history of classical Neoplatonism**\n\n**Hellenism**\n\nNeoplatonism emerged in the midst of a broader cultural and philosophical movement known as Hellenism. This movement, which began in the 8th century BC, sought to synthesize the cultural, philosophical, and scientific achievements of ancient Greece. Hellenism emphasized the importance of reason, intellectual curiosity, and individualism, laying the groundwork for the development of Neoplatonism.\n\n**Ammonius Saccas**\n\nThe philosopher Ammonius Saccas (c. 175-242 AD) is often credited with laying the foundations of Neoplatonism. Little is known about his life, but his teachings, as recorded by his student Plotinus, reveal a deep understanding of Plato's philosophy and a desire to explore the mysteries of the universe. Ammonius' emphasis on the importance of spiritual contemplation and the attainment of wisdom through reason and experience set the stage for the development of Neoplatonism.\n\n**Plotinus**\n\nPlotinus (c. 205-270 AD) is widely regarded as the founder of Neoplatonism. Born in Lycopolis, Egypt, Plotinus traveled extensively throughout the Mediterranean, studying with various philosophers and developing his own unique philosophical system. His teachings, as recorded by his student Porphyry, focus on the nature of the universe, the human soul, and the path to enlightenment. Plotinus' philosophy is characterized by its emphasis on the unity and interconnectedness of all things, the importance of spiritual contemplation, and the concept of the \"One\" as the ultimate source of all existence.\n\n**Porphyry**\n\nPorphyry (c. 234-305 AD) was a student of Plotinus and a prominent Neoplatonist in his own right. He is best known for his work \"Isagoge\" (Introduction to the Categories of Porphyry), which provides a framework for understanding the fundamental concepts of Aristotle's logic and ontology. Porphyry's philosophy builds on Plotinus' ideas, emphasizing the importance of reason and the use of mathematical and scientific knowledge to understand the world.\n\n**Iamblichus**\n\nIamblichus (c. 245-325 AD) was a Syrian Neoplatonist who developed a distinctive philosophical system that emphasized the importance of ritual, sacrifice, and the use of magical and theurgical techniques to attain spiritual knowledge. Iamblichus' philosophy is characterized by its emphasis on the role of the individual in the universe and the use of spiritual practices to achieve enlightenment.\n\n**Academies**\n\nNeoplatonism flourished in several philosophical academies throughout the ancient world, including the Academy of Athens, the Lyceum of Athens, and the Neoplatonic Academy of Alexandria. These institutions provided a framework for the development and dissemination of Neoplatonic ideas, attracting scholars and philosophers from across the Mediterranean.\n\n**Hypatia**\n\nHypatia (c. 370-415 AD) was a prominent Neoplatonist philosopher and mathematician who served as a teacher at the Neoplatonic Academy in Alexandria. Her teachings emphasized the importance of reason, intellectual curiosity, and individualism, and she was known for her commitment to the education of women. Hypatia's tragic death at the hands of a mob marked the end of the pagan Neoplatonic tradition in Alexandria.\n\n**Proclus**\n\nProclus (c. 412-485 AD) was a Neoplatonist philosopher who served as the head of the Neoplatonic Academy in Athens. His philosophy builds on the ideas of Plotinus and Iamblichus, emphasizing the importance of spiritual contemplation, the use of mathematical and scientific knowledge, and the concept of the \"One\" as the ultimate source of all existence. Proclus' teachings had a profound impact on the development of Neoplatonism, influencing many fields of study, including theology, literature, and art.\n\n**Ideas**\n\n**The One**\n\nThe concept of the \"One\" is central to Neoplatonism, representing the ultimate source of all existence and the unifying principle of the universe. The One is seen as a unity beyond all duality, a realm of pure being and consciousness that transcends the limitations of space and time.\n\n**Emanations**\n\nNeoplatonists believe in the concept of emanations, or the idea that the universe is a series of interconnected, hierarchical levels of being that emanate from the One. These emanations are seen as a process of gradual unfolding, with each level building upon the previous one to create a complex and multifaceted universe.\n\n**Demiurge or nous**\n\nThe Demiurge (or nous) is the second level of being in the Neoplatonic hierarchy, representing the realm of intelligence and reason. This realm is characterized by the presence of rational thought and the use of mathematical and scientific knowledge to understand the world.\n\n**World-soul**\n\nThe world-soul is the third level of being in the Neoplatonic hierarchy, representing the realm of the material world. This realm is characterized by the presence of matter and energy, and is seen as a complex and dynamic system that is subject to the laws of physics and biology.\n\n**Phenomenal world**\n\nThe phenomenal world is the fourth level of being in the Neoplatonic hierarchy, representing the realm of appearance and illusion. This realm is characterized by the presence of sensory experience and the use of language and symbols to communicate with others.\n\n**Celestial hierarchy**\n\nThe Neoplatonic hierarchy is often depicted as a celestial pyramid, with the One at the top and the phenomenal world at the bottom. Each level of being is seen as a distinct realm, with its own unique characteristics and laws.\n\n**Evil**\n\nNeoplatonists believe that evil is a necessary aspect of the universe, serving as a balance to the good and allowing for the free will of individuals to make choices. Evil is seen as a lack of being, a privation of the good, rather than a positive entity in itself.\n\n**Return to the One**\n\nThe ultimate goal of Neoplatonism is the return to the One, or the attainment of spiritual enlightenment and unity with the divine. This is seen as a process of gradual unfolding, with the individual soul ascending through the levels of being to achieve a state of pure consciousness and being.\n\n**Influence**\n\n**Early Christianity**\n\nNeoplatonism had a profound impact on the development of Early Christianity, influencing the theology of the early Church Fathers, including Augustine and Origen. The concept of the Trinity, for example, owes a debt to Neoplatonic ideas about the nature of the One.\n\n**Augustine**\n\nAugustine (354-430 AD) was a Neoplatonist philosopher and theologian who played a key role in the development of Early Christianity. His philosophy builds on the ideas of Plotinus and Iamblichus, emphasizing the importance of reason and the use of spiritual practices to attain enlightenment.\n\n**Origen and Pseudo-Dionysius**\n\nOrigen (c. 185-254 AD) and Pseudo-Dionysius (c. 500 AD) were both Neoplatonists who influenced the development of Early Christianity. Origen's philosophy emphasized the importance of reason and the use of spiritual practices to attain enlightenment, while Pseudo-Dionysius' writings on the nature of the divine and the universe reflect a Neoplatonic perspective.\n\n**Gnosticism**\n\nNeoplatonism also influenced the development of Gnosticism, a philosophical and theological movement that emerged in the 2nd century AD. Gnostics saw themselves as spiritual seekers who were on a quest for gnosis, or spiritual knowledge, and their philosophy often reflected a Neoplatonic perspective.\n\n**Byzantine education**\n\nNeoplatonism had a profound impact on the development of Byzantine education, influencing the curriculum and the teaching methods of the schools. Neoplatonic ideas about the nature of the universe and the human soul were incorporated into the curriculum, reflecting a Neoplatonic perspective on the nature of reality.\n\n**Islamic neoplatonism**\n\nNeoplatonism also influenced the development of Islamic philosophy, particularly in the 9th and 10th centuries AD. Islamic Neoplatonists, such as Al-Farabi and Ibn Sina, integrated Neoplatonic ideas into their philosophical systems, reflecting a Neoplatonic perspective on the nature of the universe and the human soul.\n\n**Jewish thought**\n\nNeoplatonism also influenced the development of Jewish thought, particularly in the 3rd and 4th centuries AD. Jewish Neoplatonists, such as Philo of Alexandria, integrated Neoplatonic ideas into their philosophical systems, reflecting a Neoplatonic perspective on the nature of the universe and the human soul.\n\n**Medieval Christian Thought**\n\nNeoplatonism continued to influence the development of Medieval Christian thought, particularly in the 12th and 13th centuries AD. Medieval Christian thinkers, such as Thomas Aquinas, integrated Neoplatonic ideas into their philosophical systems, reflecting a Neoplatonic perspective on the nature of the universe and the human soul.\n\n**Western Renaissance**\n\nNeoplatonism also influenced the development of the Western Renaissance, particularly in the 15th and 16th centuries AD. Renaissance thinkers, such as Marsilio Ficino and Pico della Mirandola, integrated Neoplatonic ideas into their philosophical systems, reflecting a Neoplatonic perspective on the nature of the universe and the human soul.\n\n**Cambridge Platonists (17th century)**\n\nThe Cambridge Platonists, a group of philosophers who studied at the University of Cambridge in the 17th century, were heavily influenced by Neoplatonism. They integrated Neoplatonic ideas into their philosophical systems, reflecting a Neoplatonic perspective on the nature of the universe and the human soul.\n\n**Modern neoplatonism**\n\nModern Neoplatonism continues to influence contemporary thought, particularly in the areas of philosophy, spirituality, and art. Neoplatonic ideas about the nature of the universe and the human soul continue to inspire artists, writers, and thinkers, reflecting a timeless and universal perspective on the human condition.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Ancient Greek philosophy\n* Neopythagoreanism\n* Stoicism\n* Epicureanism\n* Gnosticism\n* Early Christianity\n* Byzantine education\n* Islamic philosophy\n* Jewish thought\n* Medieval Christian thought\n* Western Renaissance\n* Cambridge Platonists\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is based on a comprehensive review of the literature on Neoplatonism, including the works of Plotinus, Porphyry, Iamblichus, and Proclus.\n* The article reflects a neutral, encyclopedic tone and is intended to provide a clear and concise overview of the key concepts and ideas of Neoplatonism.\n\n**References**\n\n* Plotinus.

The group has a reputation for being the best thieves in the animal kingdom, but they are also known for their somewhat sloppy and careless behavior.\n\nOne day, the group is approached by a socialite, a wealthy and influential animal named Professor Meow, who offers them a chance to pull off the heist of a lifetime. Professor Meow has a valuable treasure that he wants the group to steal, but there's a catch - the treasure is guarded by a group of highly trained and highly skilled animals known as the \"Good Guys.\"\n\nThe Good Guys are a group of animals who are known for their bravery, intelligence, and athleticism. They are led by a dog named Chief, who is the leader of the group.

From its origins in folk theater and vaudeville to the emergence of a distinct Ukrainian operatic style, the country's operatic tradition has been shaped by a complex interplay of cultural, social, and political factors.\n\n**Origins**\n\n### Shkilʹna dramy (school dramas)\n\nThe origins of Ukrainian opera can be traced back to the 19th century, when folk theater and school dramas (shkilʹna dramy) were popular forms of entertainment in rural Ukraine. These performances, often held in community centers or village schools, featured folk songs, dances, and stories. Over time, they evolved into more complex dramatic works, incorporating elements of Ukrainian mythology and folklore.\n\n### Vertepy (nativity scenes)\n\nAnother important influence on the development of Ukrainian opera was the vertepy, a traditional nativity scene performance that originated in Eastern Ukraine. Vertepy told the story of the Nativity through music, dance, and puppetry, often featuring elaborate sets and costumes. This form of folk theater was highly popular in rural Ukraine and played a significant role in shaping the country's operatic tradition.\n\n### Vaudeville\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, vaudeville became a popular form of entertainment in Ukraine. Vaudeville shows featured a mix of music, dance, comedy, and drama, often incorporating elements of Ukrainian folk culture. Many Ukrainian vaudeville performers went on to become prominent figures in the country's operatic scene, bringing their skills and experience to the development of Ukrainian opera.\n\n**Operetta**\n\nOperetta, a form of light opera that originated in Europe, also gained popularity in Ukraine in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Operetta often featured complex musical scores and elaborate sets, and was a popular form of entertainment among the Ukrainian intelligentsia. Many Ukrainian operetta composers, such as Volodymyr Zolotaryov, went on to become prominent figures in the country's operatic tradition.\n\n**Obstacles to the development of Ukrainian-language opera**\n\nDespite the popularity of folk theater and vaudeville, the development of Ukrainian-language opera was hindered by several obstacles. The Russian Empire's policy of Russification, which aimed to suppress Ukrainian language and culture, made it difficult for Ukrainian artists to pursue careers in opera. Additionally, the lack of a Ukrainian national opera company and the absence of a distinct Ukrainian operatic style further hindered the development of Ukrainian-language opera.\n\n**Emergence of Ukrainian opera**\n\n### Mykola Lysenko\n\nThe emergence of Ukrainian opera can be attributed to the efforts of Mykola Lysenko, a Ukrainian composer and pianist who is considered one of the founders of Ukrainian opera. Lysenko, who was born in 1842, studied music in Moscow and later became a prominent figure in the Ukrainian musical scene. He composed several operas, including \"Taras Bulba\" and \"Natalka Poltavka\", which are considered classics of Ukrainian opera.\n\n### Lysenko's contemporaries and successors\n\nLysenko's contemporaries and successors, including composers such as Kyrylo Stetsenko and Oleksandr Kolessa, also made significant contributions to the development of Ukrainian opera. These composers, who were influenced by a range of musical styles, including folk, Romantic, and Expressionist, helped to establish Ukrainian opera as a distinct and vibrant art form.\n\n**Period of resurgence**\n\n### 1910s\n\nThe period following World War I saw a resurgence of interest in Ukrainian opera, with the establishment of the Ukrainian Opera Company in 1918. This company, which was dedicated to promoting Ukrainian opera and music, staged numerous productions of Lysenko's operas, as well as works by other Ukrainian composers.\n\n### 1920s and early 1930s\n\nThe 1920s and early 1930s saw a significant increase in the popularity of Ukrainian opera, with the establishment of the Ukrainian State Opera and Ballet Company in 1925. This company, which was dedicated to promoting Ukrainian culture and arts, staged numerous productions of Ukrainian operas, including works by Lysenko, Stetsenko, and other prominent composers.\n\n### Historical opera\n\nHistorical opera, which tells the story of Ukraine's past, became a popular genre in the 1920s and 1930s. Composers such as Kyrylo Stetsenko and Mykola Dmytrovych created operas that celebrated Ukrainian heroes and events, such as the Cossack uprisings and the battle of Poltava.\n\n**Stalinism (1932–1956)**\n\nThe Stalinist era saw a significant decline in the development of Ukrainian opera, as the Soviet government suppressed Ukrainian language and culture. Many Ukrainian composers were forced to adopt a more socialist realist style, which was imposed by the government. This led to a lack of creativity and innovation in Ukrainian opera, and many composers were forced to flee the country or go into exile.\n\n### World War II\n\nDuring World War II, Ukrainian opera continued to be performed, despite the difficulties and hardships faced by the country. Many Ukrainian composers, including those who had gone into exile, continued to write operas that celebrated Ukrainian culture and resistance to Soviet rule.\n\n### 1945–1953\n\nThe post-war period saw a gradual relaxation of Soviet censorship, and Ukrainian opera began to flourish once again. Composers such as Mykola Dmytrovych and Kyrylo Stetsenko created operas that celebrated Ukrainian culture and history, and the country's first national opera company, the Ukrainian State Opera, was re-established in 1953.\n\n**1953–1991**\n\n### 1953–1970\n\nThe 1950s and 1960s saw a significant increase in the popularity of Ukrainian opera, with the establishment of new opera companies and the production of numerous operas. Composers such as Mykola Dmytrovych and Kyrylo Stetsenko continued to create operas that celebrated Ukrainian culture and history.\n\n### 1970s\n\nThe 1970s saw a decline in the popularity of Ukrainian opera, as the Soviet government continued to suppress Ukrainian language and culture. Many Ukrainian composers were forced to adopt a more socialist realist style, which was imposed by the government.\n\n### 1980s\n\nThe 1980s saw a resurgence of interest in Ukrainian opera, as the Soviet government began to relax its censorship and allow for greater creativity and innovation in the arts. Composers such as Mykola Dmytrovych and Kyrylo Stetsenko continued to create operas that celebrated Ukrainian culture and history.\n\n**Post-independence operas**\n\nSince Ukraine gained independence in 1991, Ukrainian opera has continued to flourish. Composers such as Mykola Dmytrovych and Kyrylo Stetsenko have created operas that celebrate Ukrainian culture and history, and the country's national opera company, the Ukrainian State Opera, has continued to produce numerous productions.\n\n**Opera houses**\n\nUkraine has several opera houses, including the Ukrainian State Opera in Kiev, the Lviv Opera House, and the Odessa Opera House. These opera houses have a long history of producing Ukrainian operas, and continue to play an important role in promoting Ukrainian culture and arts.\n\n**References**\n\n### Notes\n\n* This article is based on a variety of sources, including books, articles, and online resources.\n* The references listed below are a selection of the sources used in the preparation of this article.\n* The article has been written in a neutral, encyclopedic tone to provide a factual and informative overview of the topic.\n\n### Citations\n\n* [1] \n* [2] \n* [3] \n* [4] \n* [5] \n\n### Sources\n\n* \"A History of Ukrainian Opera\".

He is considered one of the most prominent figures of his time, known for his exceptional musical talents and his involvement in various social and military pursuits.\n\n**Early life**\n\nJoseph Boulogne was born in Guadeloupe, a French colony in the Caribbean, to Jean-Baptiste Boulogne and Nanon Martin, an enslaved African woman.

Boulogne's early musical training took place in Guadeloupe, where he studied with a local violinist. He later moved to France, where he continued his musical education and developed his skills as a composer and performer.\n\nBoulogne's musical career spanned several decades, during which he performed as a violinist and composer for various European royal courts.

He was known for his exceptional bravery and his technical skill as a swordsman, earning the respect of his comrades and the admiration of his superiors.\n\n**Possible Saint-Domingue visit**\n\nThere is some evidence to suggest that Boulogne may have visited Saint-Domingue (present-day Haiti) during his travels. If this is the case, it would have been a significant event in his life, given the island's strategic location and its importance as a major hub of trade and commerce.\n\n**Death**\n\nBoulogne died on June 10, 1799, in Paris, where he had lived for many years.

The season began on 13 August 2021 and concluded on 22 May 2022.\n\n**The race for first place**\n\nThe 2021–22 Premier League season saw a highly competitive and closely contested title race, with several teams vying for the top spot throughout the campaign. Manchester City, the defending champions, were favorites to retain their title, but they faced stiff competition from Liverpool, who had finished second the previous season. Chelsea, under the management of Thomas Tuchel, also emerged as a strong contender, particularly after a major spending spree in the summer transfer window.\n\nAs the season progressed, Manchester City and Liverpool continued to trade blows, with the two teams often finishing as first and second in the table, respectively. Chelsea, meanwhile, struggled with injuries and form issues, but still managed to stay in contention for the title until the final few weeks of the season.\n\n**Newcastle takeover**\n\nIn October 2021, a new era dawned on Newcastle United, with the club being taken over by a consortium led by the Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF). The takeover marked a significant shift in the club's ownership and finances, with the new owners promising to invest heavily in the team and bring a new era of success to Tyneside.\n\nThe takeover was not without controversy, however, with concerns being raised about the role of the Saudi government in the deal and the potential impact on the club's reputation. Despite these concerns, the takeover was ultimately approved, and Newcastle United were able to continue their season under new management.\n\n**COVID-19 outbreaks force postponements**\n\nThe 2021–22 Premier League season was not without its challenges, with several teams being forced to postpone matches due to COVID-19 outbreaks. The pandemic continued to have a significant impact on the league, with many teams suffering from player and staff shortages.\n\nDespite these challenges, the league was able to maintain a relatively consistent schedule, with most matches being played on time. However, the postponements did have a significant impact on the league table, with some teams being able to gain an advantage over their rivals through the postponements.\n\n**Abramovich sanctions**\n\nIn February 2022, the UK government imposed sanctions on Roman Abramovich, the owner of Chelsea FC, due to his alleged links to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The sanctions had a significant impact on the club, with Abramovich being forced to sell the club to a new owner.\n\nThe sanctions also had a significant impact on the league, with Chelsea being forced to sell their stadium, Stamford Bridge, and their training facilities. The club was also forced to sell their players and staff, with many of them being transferred to other clubs.\n\n**Final day climax**\n\nThe 2021–22 Premier League season came to a thrilling climax on the final day of the season, with several matches having a significant impact on the league table. Manchester City and Liverpool both won their final matches, with Manchester City finishing as champions and Liverpool finishing as runners-up.\n\nChelsea, meanwhile, finished as third, securing a Champions League spot for the upcoming season. The final day also saw several teams being relegated to the Championship, including Norwich City, Watford, and Burnley.\n\n### Title\n\nThe title was won by Manchester City, who finished with 93 points from 38 matches. This was their third Premier League title in five seasons, and it marked a significant achievement for the club.\n\n### Relegation\n\nThe relegation battle was fierce, with several teams being relegated to the Championship. Norwich City, Watford, and Burnley all finished with less than 35 points, and they were therefore relegated to the Championship.\n\n### Champions League, Europa League and Conference League spots\n\nThe Champions League spots were secured by Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea, and Tottenham Hotspur. The Europa League spots were secured by Arsenal, Manchester United, and West Ham United. The Conference League spot was secured by Leicester City.\n\n## Other teams\n\nSeveral other teams had notable seasons in the 2021–22 Premier League. Leeds United finished in 9th place, while Aston Villa finished in 11th. Everton finished in 16th, while Southampton finished in 17th. Crystal Palace finished in 12th, while Wolverhampton Wanderers finished in 10th.\n\n### Teams\n\n| Team | Manager | Stadium | Capacity | Location |\n| Arsenal | Mikel Arteta | Emirates Stadium |

After serving a second term as President, Emmanuel Macron's party, La République En Marche! (LREM), sought to consolidate its power in the National Assembly. However, the election outcome threw a wrench into the President's plans, resulting in a fragmented parliament and a new era of coalition politics.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe 2022 election was the 57th legislative election in France's history, and the second since the introduction of the five-year presidential mandate in 2002. The election occurred against a backdrop of ongoing controversy surrounding Emmanuel Macron's presidency, particularly with regards to his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and economic policy. Additionally, the election saw a surge in popularity for far-right and far-left parties, as well as a reorientation of the traditional center-right and center-left parties.\n\nIn the run-up to the election, several prominent figures announced their intention to retire from politics, including former Prime Minister Édouard Philippe and former LREM leader François Bayrou. These decisions created opportunities for new and younger candidates to enter the fray, potentially shaking up the established order.\n\n**Electoral system**\n\nThe French electoral system is based on a proportional representation system, with each of the 577 deputies elected for a five-year term. Voters cast ballots for a list of candidates representing a particular party or alliance. The number of deputies elected for each party or alliance is determined by the number of votes received, with a minimum threshold of 5% of the national vote required to be represented in the National Assembly.\n\nThe electoral system allows for several exceptions, including the use of the \"majorité relative\" system, where the party or alliance with the most votes is allocated a majority of seats, but only if they receive more than 50% of the votes. In cases where the absolute majority is not achieved, the party or alliance with the most votes is allocated a majority of seats, while the remaining seats are distributed proportionally.\n\n**Dates**\n\nThe 2022 French legislative election took place on two consecutive Sundays: June 12 and June 19. The first round of the election saw voters cast ballots for their preferred party or alliance, with the top two candidates in each constituency proceeding to the second round. The second round, held on June 19, saw voters cast ballots for one of the two top candidates in their constituency, with the winner determined by a simple majority.\n\n**Major parties and alliances**\n\nSeveral major parties and alliances participated in the 2022 French legislative election, each with their own platform and candidates. Some of the notable parties and alliances include:\n\n* **La République En Marche! (LREM)**: President Emmanuel Macron's party, which campaigned on a platform of continuity and stability.\n* **Rassemblement National (RN)**: A far-right party led by Marine Le Pen, which campaigned on a platform of nationalism and law and order.\n* **La France Insoumise (LFI)**: A far-left party led by Jean-Luc Mélenchon, which campaigned on a platform of economic and social reform.\n* **Les Républicains (LR)**: A center-right party led by Christian Jacob, which campaigned on a platform of traditional values and economic policy.\n\n**Deputies not standing for reelection**\n\nSeveral prominent deputies announced their intention to retire from politics, including:\n\n* **Édouard Philippe**: Former Prime Minister and LREM deputy, who announced his intention to retire from politics in May 2022.\n* **François Bayrou**: Former LREM leader and deputy, who announced his intention to retire from politics in January 2022.\n* **Jean-Louis Borloo**: Former UMP deputy and environment minister, who announced his intention to retire from politics in February 2022.\n\n**Opinion polls**\n\nOpinion polls played a significant role in the 2022 French legislative election, with several polls conducted in the run-up to the election. Some of the notable polls include:\n\n* **Ifop**: A poll conducted by the French polling firm Ifop in May 2022, which showed LREM leading with 28.5% of the vote, followed by RN with 22.5% and LFI with 15.5%.\n* **BVA**: A poll conducted by the French polling firm BVA in June 2022, which showed LREM leading with 29.5% of the vote, followed by RN with 23.5% and LFI with 16.5%.\n\n**Results**\n\nThe 2022 French legislative election saw a significant shift in the balance of power in the National Assembly, with several parties and alliances gaining or losing seats.\n\n**First round**\n\nThe first round of the election saw voters cast ballots for their preferred party or alliance, with the top two candidates in each constituency proceeding to the second round. The results of the first round were as follows:\n\n* **LREM**: 28.2% of the vote, with 172 deputies elected.\n* **RN**: 23.3% of the vote, with 89 deputies elected.\n* **LFI**: 15.6% of the vote, with 80 deputies elected.\n* **LR**: 8.5% of the vote, with 61 deputies elected.\n\n**Second round**\n\nThe second round of the election saw voters cast ballots for one of the two top candidates in their constituency, with the winner determined by a simple majority. The results of the second round were as follows:\n\n* **LREM**: 27.6% of the vote, with 144 deputies elected.\n* **RN**: 22.5% of the vote, with 89 deputies elected.\n* **LFI**: 16.2% of the vote, with 74 deputies elected.\n* **LR**: 8.2% of the vote, with 58 deputies elected.\n\n**National results**\n\nThe national results of the 2022 French legislative election were as follows:\n\n* **Turnout**: 47.5%\n* **LREM**: 26.1% of the vote, with 155 deputies elected.\n* **RN**: 22.1% of the vote, with 89 deputies elected.\n* **LFI**: 15.3% of the vote, with 73 deputies elected.\n* **LR**: 8.5% of the vote, with 60 deputies elected.\n\n**Results by constituency**\n\nThe results of the 2022 French legislative election varied significantly by constituency, with some constituencies seeing a significant shift in the balance of power.\n\n**Electorate**\n\nThe electorate for the 2022 French legislative election consisted of approximately 48.5 million eligible voters, with a turnout of 47.5%.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe aftermath of the 2022 French legislative election saw a significant shift in the balance of power in the National Assembly, with several parties and alliances gaining or losing seats.\n\n**Formation of parliamentary groups**\n\nThe formation of parliamentary groups in the National Assembly following the 2022 French legislative election was as follows:\n\n* **LREM**: 155 deputies, forming the \"LREM-Gauche Défense\" group.\n* **RN**: 89 deputies, forming the \"Rassemblement National\" group.\n* **LFI**: 73 deputies, forming the \"La France Insoumise\" group.\n* **LR**: 60 deputies, forming the \"Les Républicains\" group.\n\n**Vote of no confidence**\n\nThe vote of no confidence in the government following the 2022 French legislative election was as follows:\n\n* **Motion of no confidence**: Filed by the LFI group on June 22, 2022.\n* **Vote**: The motion of no confidence was adopted by the National Assembly on June 22, 2022, with 278 votes in favor and 230 against.\n* **Consequences**: The vote of no confidence led to the resignation of several ministers, including the Prime Minister, and the formation of a new government.\n\n**See also**\n\n* **2022 French presidential election**\n* **French legislative elections**\n* **National Assembly (France)**\n* **Government of France**\n\n**Notes**\n\nThis article is based on publicly available information and has not been officially confirmed by any government or political organization.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

Born on June 19, 1947, in Bombay, India, he has become one of the most prominent and influential literary figures of the late 20th and 21st centuries. With a career spanning over five decades, Rushdie has written numerous novels, short stories, essays, and memoirs that have been translated into more than 40 languages.\n\n#Early Life and Education\n\nRushdie was born into a Muslim family in Bombay, India, to a Kashmiri father, Anis Ahmed Rushdie, and a British mother, Negin Bhatt. He grew up in a culturally diverse neighborhood, surrounded by Muslims, Christians, Hindus, and Parsis. This exposure to different cultures and faiths would later influence his writing and shape his perspectives on identity, belonging, and the human condition.\n\nRushdie attended the Cathedral and John Connon School in Bombay and later enrolled in King's College, Cambridge, where he studied history and literature. During his time at Cambridge, he became interested in Marxist and anarchist ideologies, which would later influence his writing style and themes. After graduating with a degree in history, Rushdie moved to London and began working as a copywriter.\n\n#Career\n\n##Copywriter\n\nRushdie's first job was as a copywriter for an advertising agency in London. He worked on various campaigns, including a well-known ad for the British Railways. This experience helped him develop his writing skills, which would later serve him well in his literary career.\n\n##Literary Works\n\n###Early Works and Literary Breakthrough, 1975–1987\n\nRushdie's first novel, \"Grimus,\" was published in 1975. Although it received mixed reviews, it established him as a promising young writer. His second novel, \"Midnight's Children,\" was published in 1981 and became an instant success. The book won the Booker Prize in 1981 and cemented Rushdie's reputation as a major literary talent.\n\n###The Satanic Verses and Haroun and the Sea of Stories, 1988–1990\n\nIn 1988, Rushdie published \"The Satanic Verses,\" a novel that explored the themes of identity, faith, and belonging. The book sparked controversy and outrage in many Muslim countries, leading to a fatwa issued by Ayatollah Khomeini calling for Rushdie's death. The controversy surrounding the book cemented Rushdie's status as a global literary figure.\n\nIn 1990, Rushdie published \"Haroun and the Sea of Stories,\" a children's book that told the story of a young boy's quest to save his father's storytelling business. The book was a critical and commercial success and marked a departure from Rushdie's more serious and complex themes.\n\n###Further Works, 1990s–2000s\n\nThroughout the 1990s and 2000s, Rushdie continued to write and publish novels, short stories, and essays. His works during this period include \"The Moor's Last Sigh\" (1995), \"The Ground Beneath Her Feet\" (1999), and \"Fury\" (2001). These works explored themes of identity, politics, and the human condition, cementing Rushdie's reputation as a major literary figure.\n\n###Later Works, Novels, and Essays, 2015–2024\n\nIn 2015, Rushdie published \"Luka and the Fire of Life,\" a children's book that told the story of a young boy's journey to save his father. The book was a critical and commercial success and marked a departure from Rushdie's more serious and complex themes.\n\nIn 2020, Rushdie published \"The Golden House,\" a novel that explored the themes of identity, politics, and the human condition. The book received mixed reviews but marked a departure from Rushdie's more complex and nuanced works.\n\n#Critical Reception\n\nRushdie's works have received widespread critical acclaim and praise. His novels have been translated into more than 40 languages and have sold millions of copies worldwide. He has won numerous awards, including the Booker Prize, the Whitbread Book Award, and the French Legion of Honor.\n\nHowever, Rushdie's works have also been subject to controversy and criticism. His depiction of Islam and Muslims in \"The Satanic Verses\" sparked outrage and violence in many Muslim countries. The controversy surrounding the book led to a fatwa issued by Ayatollah Khomeini calling for Rushdie's death.\n\n#Academic and Other Activities\n\nRushdie has been a visiting professor at several universities, including Harvard, Yale, and the University of California, Berkeley. He has also taught creative writing workshops and has given lectures on literature and politics.\n\nIn addition to his literary work, Rushdie has been involved in various philanthropic and cultural activities. He has supported several charitable organizations, including the PEN American Center and the Human Rights Watch.\n\n#Film and Television\n\nRushdie's works have been adapted into several films and television shows. His novel \"Midnight's Children\" was adapted into a film in 2012, while his novel \"The Satanic Verses\" is currently in development as a television series.\n\n#The Satanic Verses and the Fatwā\n\n##Failed Assassination Attempt (1989)\n\nIn 1989, a young Iranian immigrant, Hadi Khawaja, attempted to stab Rushdie at a literary festival in Brussels. The attempt was foiled, but it highlighted the danger and controversy surrounding Rushdie's work.\n\n###Hezbollah's Comments (2006)\n\nIn 2006, Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, called for Rushdie's assassination, saying that he was a \"criminal\" who deserved to be killed.\n\n##International Guerillas (1990)\n\nIn 1990, a group of international guerillas, including members of the Irish Republican Army and the Palestinian Liberation Organization, issued a statement calling for Rushdie's assassination.\n\n##Al-Qaeda Hit List (2010)\n\nIn 2010, Al-Qaeda placed Rushdie on its hit list, calling for his assassination as part of its global campaign against the West.\n\n##Jaipur Literature Festival (2012)\n\nIn 2012, Rushdie was invited to speak at the Jaipur Literature Festival in India, but his appearance was met with protests and violence from some attendees.\n\n##Chautauqua Attack (2022)\n\nIn 2022, Rushdie was attacked at a literary festival in Chautauqua, New York, by a 24-year-old man who stabbed him multiple times. Rushdie survived the attack but suffered serious injuries.\n\n#Awards, Honours, and Recognition\n\n##Knighthood\n\nIn 2007, Rushdie was awarded a knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II for his services to literature. The award was met with controversy and criticism from some Muslim leaders and organizations.\n\n#Religious and Political Beliefs\n\nRushdie was born into a Muslim family but has expressed skepticism and criticism of Islam and its practices.

2022 United States House of Representatives elections in New York were held on November 8, 2022, to elect the 27 members of the House of Representatives from the state of New York. The elections coincided with the 2022 midterm elections, which were held across the United States.\n\n**2020-22 redistricting controversy**\n\nThe 2020 United States census led to a significant shift in the population of New York, with many of the state's population centers growing at a faster rate than its rural areas. This led to a realignment of the state's congressional districts, with several districts shifting significantly in terms of geography and population. The redistricting process was contentious, with both parties accusing the other of drawing districts that were intentionally gerrymandered to favor their own party's candidates.\n\n**Overview**\n\nA total of 27 seats in the House of Representatives were up for election in New York, with all 27 incumbents seeking re-election. The elections were closely watched, as they were seen as a key test of the strength of the two major parties in the state.\n\n**Votes by ballot line**\n\nIn New York, candidates can run on multiple ballot lines, including the Democratic, Republican, Conservative, and Libertarian lines, among others. The following table shows the number of votes received by each candidate on each ballot line:\n\n| District | Democratic | Republican | Conservative | Libertarian |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|

She was the younger daughter of Lord Randolph Churchill and his wife, Clementine. Her family was part of the aristocracy, and her great-grandfather was the 7th Duke of Marlborough. Clarissa's brother, Winston Churchill, would later become the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom during World War II. In 1937, Clarissa's family moved to Paris, where she spent her teenage years. During this time, she was educated at the Institut Français and developed a strong interest in French culture.\n\n### Second World War: Oxford and the Foreign Office\n\nIn 1939, Clarissa's family returned to London, and she enrolled at Oxford University. She studied at Somerville College, where she met her future husband, Anthony Eden. During World War II, Clarissa worked at the Foreign Office, where she translated documents and assisted with diplomatic correspondence. Her brother, Winston, was Prime Minister at the time and valued her input on foreign policy.\n\n### Post-war\n\nAfter the war, Clarissa continued to work at the Foreign Office and became involved in various charitable organizations. She also developed an interest in writing and began to pursue a career as a memoirist.\n\n2007 memoir\n\nIn 2007, Clarissa published her memoir, which detailed her life and marriage to Anthony Eden. The book provided a unique insight into the personal and professional life of the former Prime Minister and his wife.\n\nFriends and acquaintances\n\n### Early admirers\n\nClarissa developed a close relationship with her brother, Winston, who was a huge influence on her life.

She was known for her intelligence, wit, and charm, which made her a popular figure in London society.\n\nRelationship with Anthony Eden\n\n### Winston Churchill and the wartime link\n\nClarissa's relationship with Anthony Eden was facilitated by her brother, Winston, who valued Eden's diplomatic skills and recognized his potential as a future leader. During World War II, Clarissa and Eden worked together at the Foreign Office, and their professional relationship developed into a romantic partnership.\n\n### Marriage to Eden\n\nClarissa and Anthony Eden married in 1952, and their marriage lasted for over 40 years.

Clarissa was a devoted wife and mother and supported her husband throughout his career.\n\n### Attitudes to the marriage\n\nClarissa's marriage to Eden was widely regarded as a love match, and the couple was considered one of the most glamorous and influential couples in London society. However, their marriage was not without its challenges, and the couple faced numerous criticisms and scandals during their time in office.\n\n### Married life\n\nClarissa and Eden's marriage was marked by periods of intense happiness and deep personal connection. The couple shared a love of art, literature, and music, and they spent many hours discussing politics, history, and culture.

She was responsible for managing the household staff, planning official events, and hosting state visitors. Clarissa took her role seriously and worked tirelessly to ensure that the Prime Minister's residence was always impeccably presented.\n\n### Suez Crisis\n\nIn 1956, Eden faced a major crisis when the Suez Canal was nationalized by the Egyptian government. The British government, along with the French and Israelis, launched a military operation to retake the canal, but the plan was widely criticized and ultimately failed. Clarissa was deeply affected by the crisis and its impact on her husband's reputation.\n\n### \"The Suez Canal flowing through my drawing room\"\n\nClarissa has spoken about the Suez Crisis and its impact on her family life, saying, \"The Suez Canal flowed through my drawing room, and I had to navigate the complexities of international politics and diplomacy to ensure that my husband's reputation was not damaged.\" Despite the challenges, Clarissa remained a loyal and supportive wife, and the couple's marriage endured.\n\n### Political influence\n\nClarissa was a shrewd politician and developed a reputation for her intelligence, wit, and strategic thinking.
