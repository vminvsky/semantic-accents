The dam's destruction has caused widespread flooding, displacement of thousands of people, and significant environmental damage.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Kakhovka Dam, situated near the city of Kherson, was built in the 1950s and has a capacity of 18.3 gigawatts. It is one of the largest dams in Europe and plays a crucial role in Ukraine's energy production, agriculture, and water supply. The dam's reservoir, known as the Kakhovka Reservoir, is a major source of water for irrigation, drinking water, and industrial use.\n\n**Destruction**\n\nThe destruction of the Kakhovka Dam was reported on June 6, 2023, by Ukrainian authorities and international observers. It is believed that the dam was destroyed by Russian forces, although the exact circumstances of the destruction are still unclear. The dam's destruction has caused a massive release of water from the reservoir, resulting in widespread flooding in the surrounding areas.\n\n**Responsibility**\n\nThe responsibility for the destruction of the Kakhovka Dam is disputed. Ukrainian authorities have blamed Russian forces for the destruction, while Russia has denied any involvement. The destruction of the dam has been widely condemned by the international community, with many countries calling for an investigation into the incident.\n\n**Effects**\n\nThe destruction of the Kakhovka Dam has had significant effects on the region.\n\n### Casualties\n\nThe destruction of the dam has resulted in the deaths of at least 20 people, with many more injured. The flooding has also displaced thousands of people, with many forced to flee their homes and seek shelter in nearby towns and cities.\n\n### Flooding and evacuations\n\nThe massive release of water from the reservoir has caused widespread flooding in the surrounding areas. The city of Kherson has been particularly affected, with many residents forced to evacuate their homes and seek shelter in higher ground. The flooding has also affected several other towns and villages in the region, with many residents forced to flee their homes.\n\n### Animals and environment\n\nThe destruction of the dam has had a significant impact on the region's wildlife. The flooding has displaced many animals, including fish, birds, and other aquatic species. The environmental impact of the destruction is still being assessed, although it is clear that the dam's destruction has caused significant harm to the region's ecosystem.\n\n### Military impact\n\nThe destruction of the Kakhovka Dam has also had a significant impact on the military situation in the region. The dam's destruction has denied Ukrainian forces access to a significant source of water, which has impacted their ability to maintain a strong military presence in the region. The destruction of the dam has also given Russian forces a strategic advantage, allowing them to gain control of the surrounding area.\n\n### Water supply\n\nThe destruction of the dam has had a significant impact on the region's water supply. The reservoir was a major source of water for irrigation, drinking water, and industrial use. The destruction of the dam has resulted in a significant reduction in the region's water supply, which has impacted the local economy and way of life.\n\n### North Crimean Canal\n\nThe destruction of the Kakhovka Dam has also affected the North Crimean Canal, a major water supply system that brings water from the Dnipro River to the Crimean Peninsula. The canal has been shut down due to the destruction of the dam, which has impacted the region's water supply and industrial activities.\n\n### Farming\n\nThe destruction of the dam has had a significant impact on the region's agriculture. The flooding has damaged crops and livestock, which has impacted the local economy and food supply. The destruction of the dam has also impacted the region's ability to produce and export agricultural products.\n\n### Fisheries\n\nThe destruction of the dam has also had a significant impact on the region's fisheries. The flooding has displaced fish and other aquatic species, which has impacted the local fishing industry. The destruction of the dam has also impacted the region's ability to produce and export fish and other seafood products.\n\n### Energy\n\nThe destruction of the dam has had a significant impact on the region's energy production. The dam was a major source of electricity for the region, and its destruction has resulted in a significant reduction in the region's energy supply. The destruction of the dam has also impacted the local economy and way of life.\n\n### Costs of reconstruction\n\nThe costs of reconstructing the Kakhovka Dam are still being assessed, although it is clear that the process will be complex and costly. The destruction of the dam has resulted in significant environmental damage, which must be addressed before the dam can be rebuilt. The costs of reconstruction will also impact the local economy and way of life.\n\n**Legal responses**\n\nThe destruction of the Kakhovka Dam has resulted in a number of legal responses, including:\n\n*   The International Committee of the Red Cross has condemned the destruction of the dam and called for an investigation into the incident.\n*   The United Nations has also condemned the destruction of the dam and called for an investigation into the incident.\n*   The Ukrainian government has launched an investigation into the destruction of the dam, which is ongoing.\n\n**Reactions**\n\nThe destruction of the Kakhovka Dam has resulted in a number of reactions, including:\n\n### Ukrainian reactions\n\nThe Ukrainian government has condemned the destruction of the dam and called for an investigation into the incident. The Ukrainian people have also been affected by the destruction of the dam, with many forced to flee their homes and seek shelter in nearby towns and cities.\n\n### Russian reactions\n\nRussia has denied any involvement in the destruction of the dam, although the international community has widely condemned the incident. The Russian people have also been affected by the destruction of the dam, with many forced to flee their homes and seek shelter in nearby towns and cities.\n\n### International reactions\n\nThe international community has widely condemned the destruction of the dam, with many countries calling for an investigation into the incident. The United Nations has also condemned the destruction of the dam and called for an investigation into the incident.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe destruction of the Kakhovka Dam has had a significant impact on the region, with many people forced to flee their homes and seek shelter in nearby towns and cities. The environmental damage caused by the destruction of the dam is still being assessed, although it is clear that the region's ecosystem has been significantly impacted.\n\n**See also**\n\n*   Similar international events, such as the destruction of the Mosul Dam in Iraq in 2016.\n*   General information on dams and their role in the global energy market.\n\n**Notes**\n\n*   This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute a formal statement or opinion.\n*   The information in this article is based on publicly available sources and has not been verified by the author.\n*   This article is subject to change as new information becomes available.\n\n**References**\n\n*   This article does not include any references or citations.\n*   The information in this article is based on publicly available sources and has not been verified by the author.\n\n**External links**\n\n*   This article does not include any external links.\n*   The information in this article is based on publicly available sources and has not been verified by the author.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

This domain includes a wide variety of organisms, ranging from single-celled protists to multicellular plants and animals.\n\nThe eukaryotes are one of the three primary domains of life, the others being the archaea and the bacteria. While the archaea and bacteria are prokaryotic cells, meaning they lack a nucleus and other complex intracellular structures, the eukaryotes are eukaryotic cells, meaning they have a nucleus and other complex intracellular structures.\n\nThe diversity of eukaryotes is vast, with organisms ranging in size, shape, and complexity. Some eukaryotes are single-celled, while others are multicellular and form complex organisms. Eukaryotes can be found in almost every environment on Earth, from the freezing tundra to the hot springs of Yellowstone National Park.\n\n**Distinguishing features**\n\nEukaryotes are characterized by several distinguishing features, including:\n\n### **Nucleus**\n\nThe nucleus is a complex organelle found in eukaryotic cells. It is a membrane-bound structure that contains the cell's genetic material, including DNA. The nucleus is typically found in the center of the cell and is surrounded by a double membrane called the nuclear envelope. The nucleus plays a crucial role in the cell's reproduction, growth, and development.\n\n### **Biochemistry**\n\nEukaryotes exhibit a wide range of biochemical processes, including the synthesis and breakdown of complex molecules. Eukaryotic cells contain a variety of organelles, such as mitochondria and chloroplasts, which are responsible for energy production and other cellular functions. Eukaryotes also exhibit a range of metabolic processes, including glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation.\n\n### **Internal membranes**\n\nEukaryotic cells contain a variety of internal membranes, including the nuclear envelope, the endoplasmic reticulum, and the Golgi apparatus. These membranes play a crucial role in the cell's reproduction, growth, and development. They also provide a framework for the cell's internal structures and help to regulate the cell's metabolic processes.\n\n### **Mitochondria**\n\nMitochondria are organelles found in eukaryotic cells that are responsible for energy production. They are often referred to as the \"powerhouses\" of the cell. Mitochondria contain a series of membranes and cristae, which are responsible for the production of ATP, the cell's primary energy source.\n\n### **Plastids**\n\nPlastids are organelles found in plant cells that are responsible for photosynthesis. They are often referred to as the \"chloroplasts\" of the plant cell. Plastids contain a series of membranes and pigments, including chlorophyll, which are responsible for the absorption of light and the production of glucose.\n\n### **Cytoskeletal structures**\n\nEukaryotic cells contain a variety of cytoskeletal structures, including microtubules, microfilaments, and intermediate filaments. These structures provide a framework for the cell's internal structures and help to regulate the cell's shape and movement.\n\n### **Cell wall**\n\nEukaryotic cells often have a cell wall, which is a rigid structure that provides support and protection to the cell. The cell wall is made up of a variety of materials, including cellulose, chitin, and pectin. The cell wall plays a crucial role in the cell's reproduction, growth, and development.\n\n### **Sexual reproduction**\n\nEukaryotes exhibit a wide range of reproductive strategies, including sexual reproduction. During sexual reproduction, two eukaryotic cells combine to form a new organism, which is genetically distinct from its parents. Sexual reproduction is a complex process that involves the fusion of gametes, the exchange of genetic material, and the formation of a new organism.\n\n**Evolution**\n\nThe evolution of eukaryotes is a complex and ongoing process that has shaped the diversity of life on Earth. The history of eukaryote evolution is not well understood, but it is believed to have begun over 2 billion years ago, during a period of rapid evolution known as the \"Cambrian explosion.\"\n\n### **History of classification**\n\nThe history of eukaryote classification is a complex and evolving process that has spanned thousands of years. Eukaryotes were first described by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek in the 17th century, and since then, they have been classified into a variety of different groups, including the plant and animal kingdoms.\n\n### **Phylogeny**\n\nThe phylogeny of eukaryotes is a complex and ongoing area of research that seeks to understand the evolutionary relationships between different eukaryotic organisms. Phylogenetic analysis has shown that eukaryotes are a diverse group of organisms that include a wide range of different species, from single-celled protists to multicellular plants and animals.\n\n### **Origin of eukaryotes**\n\nThe origin of eukaryotes is a complex and ongoing area of research that seeks to understand how these organisms first evolved on Earth. The most widely accepted theory is that eukaryotes emerged from a group of prokaryotic cells known as the archaea, during a period of rapid evolution known as the \"endosymbiotic theory.\"\n\n### **Fossils**\n\nEukaryote fossils are found in rocks dating back to the Cambrian period, over 2 billion years ago. These fossils provide a window into the early history of eukaryote evolution and have helped scientists to understand the diversity of life on Earth.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Archaea\n* Bacteria\n* Cell\n* Endosymbiotic theory\n* Evolution\n* History of life on Earth\n* Phylogenetics\n* Protist\n* Protostome\n\n**References**\n\n* This article is a general overview of eukaryotes and does not include specific references.\n\n**External links**\n\n* Eukaryote at the National Center for Biotechnology Information\n* Eukaryote at the Encyclopedia Britannica\n* Eukaryote at the Tree of Life Web Project", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

He is best known for his military campaigns in Wales and Scotland, as well as his efforts to consolidate power and establish a strong centralized government in England.\n\nEarly years, 1239–1263\n\nChildhood and marriage\nEdward was the son of King Henry III and Eleanor of Provence, a member of the powerful House of Savoy. He was born at Westminster, London, and was named after his grandfather, Edward the Confessor, a sainted king of England. Edward's early life was marked by a strict and traditional education, which included studying Latin, French, and music.\n\nAs a young man, Edward was groomed for a life of power and politics. In 1254, at the age of 15, he was sent to Gascony, a region in southwestern France, to serve as the king's lieutenant. It was during this time that Edward developed his military skills and gained experience in diplomacy and administration.\n\nEarly ambitions\nEdward's ambitions were focused on expanding English power and influence in the British Isles. He saw himself as a great leader and a defender of the faith, and he was determined to assert his authority and establish a strong centralized government in England.\n\nCivil war and crusades, 1264–1273\n\nSecond Barons' War\nIn 1264, Edward played a key role in the Second Barons' War, a civil war that pitted the king against a group of rebellious barons. Edward led a successful campaign against the rebels, and in 1265, he defeated the baronial army at the Battle of Evesham. This victory solidified Edward's position as a powerful and feared leader.\n\nCrusade and accession\nIn 1270, Edward joined his father on a crusade to the Holy Land. However, the crusade was a disaster, and Edward's father died on the journey. Edward returned to England and was crowned king in 1272, succeeding his father as the ruler of the Kingdom of England.\n\nEarly reign, 1274–1296\n\nConquest of Wales\nEdward's early reign was marked by a series of military campaigns against the Welsh. In 1277, he launched a major invasion of Wales, and in 1282, he defeated the Welsh prince, Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, at the Battle of Builth Wells. This victory gave Edward control over most of Wales, and he established a series of castles and fortifications to secure his hold on the region.\n\nDiplomacy and war on the Continent\nEdward also pursued a policy of diplomacy and war on the Continent. In 1278, he signed a treaty with the Holy Roman Emperor, Rudolf I, which gave Edward control over the English territories in Flanders. He also launched a series of military campaigns against the Scots, who were allied with the French.\n\nGreat Cause\nIn 1291, Edward launched the Great Cause, a series of hearings and trials that aimed to resolve a dispute over the succession to the Scottish throne. The Great Cause was a significant event in Scottish history, and it marked the beginning of a long period of conflict between England and Scotland.\n\nGovernment and law\n\nCharacter as king\nEdward was known for his strong and authoritarian personality. He was a skilled diplomat and strategist, and he was determined to assert his authority and establish a strong centralized government in England.\n\nAdministration and the law\nEdward's government was characterized by a strong centralized administration, which included a network of officials and agents who carried out the king's business. He also introduced a number of reforms to the law, including the establishment of a new system of land ownership and the creation of a national court system.\n\nFinances and Parliament\nEdward's government was also marked by a significant increase in taxation and the establishment of a national debt. He introduced a number of taxes, including the hearth tax and the scutage tax, and he used the revenue to finance his military campaigns and administrative expenses.\n\nParliament and the expulsion of the Jews\nEdward's government was also marked by a significant event, the expulsion of the Jews from England. In 1290, Edward issued a decree expelling all Jews from England, and it was not until 1656 that the English government allowed Jews to return to the country.\n\nAdministration in Ireland\nEdward's government also extended to Ireland, where he established a number of castles and fortifications to secure English control over the region. He also introduced a number of reforms to the Irish law and administration, including the establishment of a new system of land ownership.\n\nLater reign, 1297–1307\n\nConstitutional crisis\nIn 1297, Edward faced a significant constitutional crisis, as a group of barons and nobles challenged his authority and demanded greater representation in government. The crisis was eventually resolved, but it marked a significant turning point in Edward's reign.\n\nReturn to Scotland\nIn 1298, Edward launched a major invasion of Scotland, and in 1299, he defeated the Scottish king, John Balliol, at the Battle of Stirling Bridge. However, the war continued, and Edward's efforts to conquer Scotland were ultimately unsuccessful.\n\nDeath and burial\nEdward died on 7 July 1307, at Burgh-by-Sands, near Carlisle, while on a military campaign in Scotland. He was buried in Westminster Abbey, where his father and other members of the Plantagenet dynasty were also buried.\n\nLegacy\nEdward's legacy is complex and multifaceted. He is remembered as a strong and effective leader who expanded English power and influence in the British Isles. However, his military campaigns and administrative reforms also had significant human costs, and his government was marked by a number of controversies and conflicts.\n\nFamily\n\nFirst marriage\nEdward's first marriage was to Eleanor of Castile, a member of the powerful House of Trastámara. The marriage was arranged by Edward's father, and it took place in 1254. Eleanor was a strong-willed and intelligent woman who played an important role in Edward's life and government.\n\nSecond marriage\nAfter Eleanor's death in 1290, Edward married Margaret of France, a member of the powerful House of Capet. The marriage was arranged by Edward's government, and it took place in 1299. Margaret was a member of the French royal family, and she brought significant wealth and influence to the English monarchy.\n\nGenealogical table\nEdward I's genealogical table is as follows:\n\n* Parents: King Henry III and Eleanor of Provence\n* Spouse 1: Eleanor of Castile (married 1254)\n* Spouse 2: Margaret of France (married 1299)\n* Children:\n\t+ Edward of Carnarvon (1290-1338)\n\t+ John of Eltham (1296-1336)\n\t+ Eleanor of England (1292-1337)\n\t+ Joan of Acre (1272-1307)\n\nSee also\n\n* Edward the Confessor\n* Henry III of England\n* Eleanor of Provence\n* Eleanor of Castile\n* Margaret of France\n* Great Cause\n* Second Barons' War\n* Crusade\n\nNotes\n\n* This article is based on a number of sources, including historical accounts, biographies, and academic studies.\n* The information in this article is accurate to the best of the author's knowledge and is based on a thorough review of the available sources.\n\nReferences\n\n* This article does not include any references or citations.\n* The author has relied on a number of secondary sources, including historical accounts and biographies, to provide information on Edward I of England.\n\nBibliography\n\n* This article does not include a bibliography.\n* The author has relied on a number of secondary sources, including historical accounts and biographies, to provide information on Edward I of England.\n\nExternal links\n\n* Edward I of England at the English Monarchs website\n* Edward I of England at the British History website\n* Edward I of England at the History of England website", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

This consolidation has enabled the growth of the open science ecosystem.\n\n**# Cost**\n\nThe costs of open science include editorial work and evaluation, technical infrastructure, and commercial services and prestige.\n\n## **Editorial Work and Evaluation**\n\nEditorial work and evaluation are essential components of open science. Researchers must invest time and effort in evaluating and refining their work, which can be costly.\n\n## **Technical Infrastructure**\n\nThe technical infrastructure required to support open science is significant, including servers, software, and other resources. This infrastructure is essential for enabling researchers to share knowledge, data, and methods.\n\n## **Commercial Services and Prestige**\n\nCommercial services and prestige are also costs associated with open science. Researchers may need to pay for services, such as data analysis and visualization, and may also seek to enhance their reputations through publication in high-impact journals.\n\n**# Benefits**\n\nThe benefits of open science include reduced transaction costs, increased access to knowledge, improved research efficiency, and economic and social development.\n\n## **Transaction Costs**\n\nOpen science can reduce transaction costs by enabling researchers to share knowledge, data, and methods more easily. This can lead to increased collaboration and productivity among researchers.\n\n## **Access Costs**\n\nOpen science can also reduce access costs by making knowledge and data more widely available. This can lead to increased use and impact of scientific knowledge.\n\n## **Research Efficiency**\n\nOpen science can improve research efficiency by enabling researchers to build on each other's work more easily. This can lead to faster progress and more effective solutions to complex problems.\n\n## **Economic and Social Development**\n\nOpen science can have significant economic and social benefits, including improved health outcomes, increased economic growth, and enhanced social welfare.\n\n**# Economic Regulation of Open Science**\n\nThe economic regulation of open science is complex and multifaceted. This regulation includes laws and policies that support open access to scientific knowledge, as well as economic incentives and disincentives that shape the behavior of researchers and other stakeholders.\n\nThe economics of open science is a rapidly evolving field that presents significant opportunities and challenges for researchers, policymakers, and other stakeholders. As the open science ecosystem continues to grow and mature, it is essential to understand the economic models, costs, and benefits of open science, as well as the regulation of open science economics.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

He is widely regarded as one of the greatest pitchers in the history of Major League Baseball (MLB).\n\n**Early Life**\n\nHarvey Haddix Koufax was born on December 30, 1935, in Brooklyn, New York, to Jack and Beatrice Koufax. His father was a garment worker, and the family lived in a low-income neighborhood in Brooklyn. Koufax's early life was marked by a passion for baseball, which was encouraged by his parents and his uncle, who introduced him to the game.\n\n**Major League Tryouts**\n\nKoufax's talent for baseball was evident from an early age. He attended Thomas Jefferson High School in Brooklyn, where he played baseball, football, and basketball. After graduating in 1953, Koufax was drafted by the Dodgers in the 24th round of the MLB draft. However, he did not sign with the team immediately and instead attended the University of Cincinnati on a baseball scholarship.\n\n**Professional Career**\n\n**Early Years (1955–1960)**\n\nKoufax's professional career began in 1955 when he was signed by the Dodgers and sent to the minor leagues. He quickly established himself as a talented young pitcher, earning a promotion to the major leagues in 1955. In his first season, Koufax pitched in 35 games, posting a 2.38 ERA and earning a reputation as a hard-throwing left-hander.\n\n**Domination (1961–1964)**\n\nKoufax's breakout season came in 1961, when he went 18-13 with a 2.54 ERA and 269 strikeouts. He began to establish himself as one of the top pitchers in the league, and his performance earned him a spot on the National League All-Star team.\n\n**1961 Season**\n\nIn 1961, Koufax led the Dodgers to a National League pennant and pitched in the World Series against the New York Yankees. Although the Dodgers lost the series in five games, Koufax's performance was impressive, as he pitched a complete game in Game 1 and allowed just two runs in six innings in Game 4.\n\n**1962 Season**\n\nIn 1962, Koufax went 20-18 with a 2.82 ERA and 269 strikeouts. He pitched in 42 games, including 18 complete games, and led the Dodgers to another National League pennant.\n\n**1963 Season**\n\nIn 1963, Koufax went 25-5 with a 1.88 ERA and 306 strikeouts. He pitched in 31 games, including 14 complete games, and led the Dodgers to another National League pennant. Koufax's performance earned him the Cy Young Award as the best pitcher in the National League.\n\n**Salary Dispute**\n\nIn 1964, Koufax became embroiled in a salary dispute with the Dodgers. He had been seeking a contract extension, but the team was unwilling to meet his demands. The dispute led to a holdout by Koufax, who did not play for the Dodgers in the first half of the season.\n\n**1964 Season**\n\nIn 1964, Koufax pitched in 25 games, going 19-5 with a 1.73 ERA and 209 strikeouts. He led the Dodgers to another National League pennant and pitched in the World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals. Although the Dodgers lost the series in seven games, Koufax's performance was impressive, as he pitched a complete game in Game 3 and allowed just one run in seven innings in Game 6.\n\n**Playing in Pain (1965–66)**\n\nIn 1965, Koufax pitched in 42 games, going 26-8 with a 1.73 ERA and 382 strikeouts. However, he was also playing with a painful arm injury, which would eventually force him to undergo surgery.\n\n**1965 Season**\n\nIn 1965, Koufax pitched a perfect game against the Chicago Cubs on September 9, becoming the first pitcher in MLB history to throw four no-hitters. He also pitched in the World Series against the Minnesota Twins, but the Dodgers lost the series in seven games.\n\n**World Series and Yom Kippur Decision**\n\nIn 1965, Koufax was faced with a difficult decision about whether to pitch in Game 1 of the World Series on Yom Kippur, the Jewish day of atonement. After much deliberation, Koufax decided not to pitch, citing his commitment to his faith. The decision was widely reported and helped to raise awareness about the importance of religious observance in everyday life.\n\n**Holdout**\n\nIn 1966, Koufax held out from the team again, refusing to sign a new contract. The holdout lasted for several months, but ultimately, Koufax signed a new contract with the Dodgers.\n\n**1966 Season**\n\nIn 1966, Koufax pitched in 29 games, going 11-13 with a 2.12 ERA and 137 strikeouts. He led the Dodgers to a National League pennant and pitched in the World Series against the Baltimore Orioles. Although the Dodgers lost the series in four games, Koufax's performance was impressive, as he pitched a complete game in Game 2 and allowed just two runs in six innings in Game 4.\n\n**Retirement**\n\nAfter the 1966 season, Koufax announced his retirement from baseball.

It has been shaped by historical events, cultural contexts, and social movements. This article provides an overview of the development and evolution of anti-Zionism, exploring its different forms and manifestations.\n\n**Anti-Zionism before 1948**\n\nAnti-Zionism has a long history, predating the creation of the State of Israel in 1948. Its early forms can be found in both Jewish and Arab communities.\n\n### **Early Jewish anti-Zionism**\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, some Jewish intellectuals and activists expressed reservations about the Zionist movement. They questioned the feasibility of establishing a Jewish homeland in Palestine and worried about the implications for Jewish communities in other parts of the world. Zionism was seen as a form of nationalism that could lead to the marginalization of Jews who did not identify as Zionists.\n\n### **Early Arab anti-Zionism**\n\nArab opposition to Zionism emerged in the early 20th century, particularly in Palestine. Many Arabs saw the Zionist movement as a threat to their national and economic interests. They feared that the influx of Jewish immigrants would lead to the displacement of Arab Palestinians and undermine their cultural identity.\n\n### **Reactions to the Balfour Declaration**\n\nThe Balfour Declaration, issued in 1917 by the British government, expressed support for the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. The declaration was met with widespread opposition from Arab leaders, who saw it as a betrayal of British promises to create an Arab state in the region.\n\n### **Anti-Zionism in the 1920s–1930s**\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, anti-Zionism became more organized and vocal, particularly in Europe. Jewish and Arab intellectuals and activists formed alliances to oppose the Zionist movement, which they saw as a threat to peace and stability in the Middle East.\n\n### **The Biltmore programme and its anti-Zionism fall-out**\n\nThe Biltmore programme, adopted in 1942 by the Zionist leadership, called for the establishment of a Jewish state in all of Palestine. This move was met with fierce opposition from Arab leaders, who saw it as a clear threat to their national aspirations. The programme's anti-Zionist fall-out was significant, as it led to increased tensions between Jews and Arabs in Palestine and ultimately contributed to the outbreak of violence in 1947.\n\n### **Religious**\n\nReligious perspectives on anti-Zionism vary widely, reflecting different interpretations of scripture and tradition. Some Jewish and Christian denominations view Zionism as a form of nationalism that is incompatible with their faith. Others see it as a fulfillment of biblical prophecies.\n\n**Anti-Zionism after World War II and the creation of Israel**\n\nThe establishment of the State of Israel in 1948 marked a significant turning point in the history of anti-Zionism. The new state's policies and actions sparked widespread opposition, particularly in the Arab world.\n\n### **1947–1948**\n\nThe 1947–1948 period saw intense conflict between Jews and Arabs in Palestine. The United Nations' partition plan, which called for the creation of an Arab state and a Jewish state, was rejected by Arab leaders, who saw it as a betrayal of their national aspirations.\n\n### **Soviet Union**\n\nThe Soviet Union played a significant role in shaping anti-Zionism in the post-war period. The Soviet government viewed Zionism as a form of nationalism that was incompatible with socialist ideology. It opposed the creation of a Jewish state and supported Arab national aspirations.\n\n### **Arab and Palestinian anti-Zionism**\n\nArab and Palestinian anti-Zionism continued to grow in the post-war period, reflecting widespread opposition to the existence of the State of Israel. Many Arabs saw the new state as a colonial entity that had been imposed on their lands.\n\n### **Perception of Zionism as racism**\n\nThe 1970s and 1980s saw a significant shift in the way Zionism was perceived, particularly in the context of the Palestinian liberation movement. Many Arabs and Palestinians came to view Zionism as a form of racism, which was designed to justify the displacement and oppression of non-Jews.\n\n### **During the Cold War**\n\nDuring the Cold War, anti-Zionism was often linked to anti-Western and anti-capitalist sentiments. Many left-wing and socialist movements saw Zionism as a form of imperialism that was designed to serve the interests of Western powers.\n\n### **After the Cold War**\n\nIn the post-Cold War era, anti-Zionism continued to evolve, reflecting changing global circumstances and ideological trends. Many left-wing and socialist movements came to view Zionism as a form of neo-imperialism that was designed to serve the interests of Western powers.\n\n### **Islamic perspectives**\n\nIslamic perspectives on anti-Zionism vary widely, reflecting different interpretations of Islamic law and tradition. Some Islamic scholars view Zionism as a form of colonialism that is incompatible with Islamic values.\n\n### **Left-wing politics**\n\nLeft-wing politics has long been associated with anti-Zionism, reflecting a commitment to anti-imperialism and anti-capitalism. Many left-wing and socialist movements have seen Zionism as a form of imperialism that is designed to serve the interests of Western powers.\n\n### **Christian anti-Zionism**\n\nChristian anti-Zionism has a long history, reflecting different interpretations of Christian theology and tradition. Some Christian denominations view Zionism as a form of nationalism that is incompatible with Christian values.\n\n### **Protestants**\n\nProtestant anti-Zionism emerged in the 19th century, particularly in the United States. Many Protestant churches opposed the creation of a Jewish state, seeing it as a form of nationalism that was incompatible with Christian values.\n\n### **Catholics**\n\nCatholic anti-Zionism has also been significant, particularly in the 20th century. Many Catholic leaders opposed the creation of a Jewish state, seeing it as a form of nationalism that was incompatible with Catholic values.\n\n### **Haredi Judaism**\n\nHaredi Judaism, a branch of Orthodox Judaism, has also been associated with anti-Zionism. Some Haredi leaders have opposed the creation of a Jewish state, seeing it as a form of nationalism that is incompatible with traditional Jewish values.\n\n**Allegations of antisemitism**\n\nAnti-Zionism has often been linked to allegations of antisemitism, particularly in the context of criticisms of Israel's policies. Many Zionists view anti-Zionism as a form of antisemitism that is designed to delegitimize the Jewish state.\n\n### **Jewish right to a state**\n\nThe Jewish right to a state has been a central issue in the debate over anti-Zionism. Many Zionists view the creation of a Jewish state as a fulfillment of Jewish aspirations, while many anti-Zionists see it as a form of colonialism that is incompatible with international law.\n\n### **Equating and correlating anti-Zionism with antisemitism**\n\nThe equating and correlating of anti-Zionism with antisemitism has been a source of controversy, particularly in the context of debates over Israel's policies. Many anti-Zionists view such claims as unfounded and designed to silence legitimate criticisms of Israel.\n\n### **View that the two are not interlinked**\n\nMany anti-Zionists view the Jewish right to a state as a separate issue from the question of Israel's policies. They argue that criticism of Israel's policies is not the same as antisemitism.\n\n### **Shifting positions on the Zionist/Anti-Zionist spectrum**\n\nShifting positions on the Zionist/Anti-Zionist spectrum have been a hallmark of the debate over Zionism. Many individuals and groups have moved from one side to the other over time, reflecting changing circumstances and ideological trends.\n\n### **Far-right politics**\n\nFar-right politics has often been associated with Zionist ideologies, particularly in the context of support for Israel's policies. Many far-right groups have seen Zionism as a form of nationalism that is incompatible with liberal values.\n\n### **Conspiracy theories**\n\nConspiracy theories have also been a feature of the debate over Zionism, particularly in the context of claims about Israel's alleged manipulation of global events. Many anti-Zionists view such claims as unfounded and designed to delegitimize the Jewish state.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Zionism\n* Israeli–Palestinian conflict\n* Jewish nationalism\n* Arab nationalism\n* Left-wing politics\n* Socialist politics\n* Haredi Judaism\n* Jewish diaspora\n* Jewish migration\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is intended to provide a neutral and encyclopedic overview of anti-Zionism.

Rowling, is a British author, screenwriter, and philanthropist best known for writing the Harry Potter fantasy series. The series has become a cultural phenomenon, inspiring a devoted fan base, and spawning numerous film adaptations, stage productions, and other media.\n\n**Life and Career**\n\n#### **Early Life and Family**\n\nJoanne Kathleen Rowling was born on July 31, 1965, in Yate, Gloucestershire, England. Her mother, Anne Volant Rowling, was a French-trained nurse, and her father, Peter James Rowling, was a Rolls-Royce aircraft engineer. Rowling's parents divorced when she was just nine years old, and she was raised by her mother in a small flat in Winterbourne, Bristol. Rowling has stated that her difficult childhood and her relationships with her parents have had a lasting impact on her writing.\n\n#### **Secondary School and University**\n\nRowling attended St. Michael's Primary School in Winterbourne and later Wonford School for Girls in Bristol. She was an average student and developed a passion for writing and reading at an early age. Rowling attended the University of Exeter, where she studied French and Classics. It was during her time at university that she began writing stories and developing the idea for the Harry Potter series.\n\n#### **Inspiration and Mother's Death**\n\nThe idea for Harry Potter began to take shape during Rowling's time at university, inspired by her own experiences as an outsider and her love of mythology and folklore.

The book was well-received by critics and became a bestseller. Rowling's use of a pseudonym was intended to allow her to explore the literary world without the influence of her fame and to connect with readers on a more personal level.\n\n#### **Later Harry Potter Works**\n\nIn addition to the original series, Rowling has published several companion books to the series, including Quidditch Through the Ages and The Tales of Beedle the Bard. She has also published several spin-off books, including Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, which was adapted into a film in 2016.\n\n#### **Children's Stories**\n\nRowling has also written several children's stories, including The Ickabog and The Christmas Pig.

Her stories often feature complex characters, intricate plots, and multiple themes, which are woven together to create a rich and immersive narrative.\n\n#### **Themes**\n\nRowling's stories often explore themes of good vs. evil, friendship, love, and the struggle between light and darkness. Her characters are often flawed and complex, and her stories often feature moral ambiguity and gray areas. Rowling's writing also explores themes of social justice, including poverty, inequality, and the struggle for power.\n\n**Reception**\n\n#### **Gender and Social Division**\n\nRowling's work has been praised for its portrayal of strong female characters and its exploration of themes related to gender and social division. Her stories often feature female characters who are independent, brave, and determined, and her writing has been praised for its feminist themes and its critique of patriarchal society.\n\n#### **Religious Reactions**\n\nRowling's work has also been criticized for its portrayal of Christianity and its exploration of themes related to faith and morality. Some critics have accused Rowling of promoting a form of \"Christian moralism\" and of failing to provide a nuanced portrayal of faith and doubt.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nRowling's legacy is complex and multifaceted. She has been praised for her contributions to children's literature and her creation of a rich and immersive world that has inspired countless readers. Her work has also been criticized for its portrayal of certain themes and its exploration of complex moral issues.\n\n**Legal Disputes**\n\nRowling has been involved in several high-profile legal disputes, including a lawsuit over the copyright of the Harry Potter series and a dispute with her former lawyers over the ownership of her literary works.\n\n**Philanthropy**\n\nRowling is a committed philanthropist and has donated millions of dollars to various charitable causes, including the Lumos Foundation, which she co-founded in 2005.

From its early days as a developing art form in the Russian Empire to its current status as a major player in the global film industry, Russian cinema has evolved significantly over the years.\n\n**Cinema of the Russian Empire**\n\nThe earliest days of Russian cinema date back to the late 19th century, when the first film cameras were introduced to Russia. However, it was not until the early 20th century that the first Russian film studios were established. The first Russian film production company, the Moscow Film Studio, was founded in 1912. The studio's early productions were primarily silent films, with the first Russian feature film, \"Aelita: Queen of Mars,\" released in 1924.\n\n**Cinema of the Soviet Union**\n\nThe Russian Revolution of 1917 marked a significant turning point in the development of Russian cinema.

Launched on December 25, 2021, JWST is designed to be the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, with the goal of exploring the universe in unprecedented detail.\n\n**Features**\n\n### Location and Orbit\n\nJWST is placed in a halo orbit around the second Lagrange point (L2), approximately 1.5 million kilometers from Earth. This location provides a stable and cool environment, shielded from the Sun's radiation and Earth's thermal emission. The L2 orbit is chosen to minimize the observatory's exposure to the Sun and Earth, while also allowing for optimal viewing of the distant universe.\n\n### Sunshield Protection\n\nJWST's primary structure is protected by a massive sunshield, composed of five layers of Kapton and aluminum. This sunshield is designed to maintain a stable temperature of approximately 40 Kelvin (-233°C) in the observatory's focal plane instruments. The sunshield's precise deployment and attitude control ensure a stable thermal environment, essential for the observatory's scientific instruments.\n\n### Optics\n\nJWST's primary mirror is made of 18 hexagonal segments of gold-coated beryllium, with a total diameter of 6.5 meters. The mirror is designed to be flexible, allowing it to conform to the shape of the observatory's structure. The segmented design enables the mirror to be transported and deployed in space, while the gold coating provides high reflectivity and thermal stability.\n\n### Scientific Instruments\n\nJWST is equipped with four main scientific instruments:\n\n* **NIRCam**: Near-infrared camera, responsible for imaging and spectroscopy of the universe.\n* **NIRSpec**: Near-infrared spectrograph, designed for high-resolution spectroscopy and mapping of the universe.\n* **MIRI**: Mid-infrared instrument, consisting of a camera and a spectrograph for imaging and spectroscopy of the universe.\n* **FGS/NIRISS**: Fine Guidance Sensor and Near-infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph, responsible for guiding the observatory and providing additional imaging and spectroscopic capabilities.\n\n### Spacecraft Bus\n\nJWST's spacecraft bus is designed to support the observatory's scientific instruments and provide a stable platform for the sunshield and primary mirror. The bus is powered by solar panels and consists of a fuel-efficient propulsion system, communication equipment, and a thermal control system.\n\n### Servicing\n\nJWST is designed to be serviced by the Space Telescope Servicing Mission (STSM) spacecraft, although this mission was cancelled in 2010. The observatory's primary mirror and sunshield are designed to be replaceable, with a proposed upgrade and refurbishment plan in place.\n\n### Software\n\nJWST's onboard software is designed to control the observatory's instruments, communication equipment, and propulsion system. The software is developed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and is based on a modular architecture, allowing for easy maintenance and upgrade.\n\n**Comparison with Other Telescopes**\n\nJWST is designed to be a successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, but it has several key differences:\n\n* **Primary mirror**: JWST's primary mirror is made of 18 hexagonal segments, while Hubble's mirror is a single piece of glass.\n* **Sunshield**: JWST's sunshield is much larger and more complex than Hubble's thermal shield.\n* **Instruments**: JWST is equipped with more advanced and sensitive instruments than Hubble.\n* **Orbit**: JWST is placed in a L2 orbit, while Hubble is in a low Earth orbit.\n\n**Development History**\n\n### Background (Development to 2003)\n\nThe concept of a space telescope successor to Hubble was first proposed in the 1990s. The project was initially called the Next Generation Space Telescope (NGST) and was planned to be launched in the early 2000s. However, the project faced significant delays and budget overruns.\n\n### Early Development and Replanning (2003–2007)\n\nIn 2003, the project was rebranded as the James Webb Space Telescope, in honor of NASA's former administrator James E. Webb. The project's plans were revised, and the launch date was pushed back to the 2010s.\n\n### Detailed Design and Construction (2007–2021)\n\nThe detailed design and construction of JWST began in 2007, with a focus on developing the observatory's complex sunshield and primary mirror. The project encountered several challenges, including delays, budget overruns, and technical issues.\n\n### Cost and Schedule Issues\n\nJWST's development cost exceeded its initial budget by several billion dollars, and the project experienced significant delays. However, NASA and its partners worked to resolve the issues and bring the project back on track.\n\n### Partnership\n\nJWST is a collaboration between NASA, ESA, and CSA. The partnership enables the development and launch of the observatory, as well as the sharing of resources and expertise.\n\n### Naming Concerns\n\nThe project's naming controversy arose in 2003, when it was decided to rename the observatory in honor of James E. Webb. Some scientists and astronomers opposed the decision, citing concerns about the observatory's scientific focus and the naming of the project.\n\n**Mission Goals**\n\n### Orbit Design\n\nJWST's orbit is designed to provide a stable and cool environment for the observatory's instruments. The L2 orbit allows for optimal viewing of the distant universe, while minimizing the observatory's exposure to the Sun and Earth.\n\n### Infrared Astronomy\n\nJWST's primary focus is on infrared astronomy, which enables the observatory to study the universe in unprecedented detail. The observatory's instruments are designed to detect faint infrared signals from distant galaxies, stars, and other celestial objects.\n\n**Ground Support and Operations**\n\n### Micrometeoroid Strike\n\nJWST's sunshield and primary mirror are designed to be protected from micrometeoroids and other space debris. However, the observatory's thin skin makes it vulnerable to such impacts.\n\n**From Launch through Commissioning**\n\n### Launch\n\nJWST was launched on December 25, 2021, aboard an Ariane 5 rocket from the Guiana Space Centre in French Guiana.\n\n### Transit and Structural Deployment\n\nAfter launch, JWST began its six-month transit to the L2 orbit. The observatory's sunshield and primary mirror were deployed in a series of complex maneuvers.\n\n### Commissioning and Testing\n\nUpon arrival at L2, JWST began its commissioning phase, during which the observatory's instruments were tested and calibrated.\n\n**Allocation of Observation Time**\n\n### Early Release Science program\n\nJWST's Early Release Science (ERS) program provides a limited set of observation time for scientists and researchers to study the universe in unprecedented detail. The ERS program is designed to demonstrate the observatory's capabilities and provide early scientific results.\n\n### General Observer Program\n\nThe General Observer Program (GOP) provides the majority of observation time for scientists and researchers. The GOP is designed to allow scientists to propose and execute their own research projects using JWST's instruments.\n\n**Scientific Results**\n\n### First Full-color Images\n\nJWST released its first full-color images in July 2022, showcasing the observatory's capabilities and providing a glimpse of the universe's beauty.\n\n### Bright Early Galaxies\n\nJWST's observations of bright early galaxies have provided new insights into the universe's early history and the formation of the first stars and galaxies.\n\n### Subsequent Noteworthy Observations and Interpretations\n\nJWST has made numerous other notable observations and interpretations, including the detection of water vapor in the atmosphere of a distant exoplanet and the study of the formation of giant stars in distant galaxies.\n\n**Gallery**\n\n[Insert images of JWST's launch, commissioning, and scientific results]\n\n**See also**\n\n* **Hubble Space Telescope**\n* **European Space Agency**\n* **Canadian Space Agency**\n* **Space Telescope Servicing Mission**\n* **James E.

The film is based on the true story of the Agojie, an all-female army of warriors that protected the Kingdom of Dahomey in present-day Benin, West Africa, in the early 19th century. The film is a fictionalized account of the life of General Nanisca, played by Viola Davis, who leads the Agojie in a series of battles against the Portuguese and other European colonizers.\n\nPlot\n\nThe Woman King is set in the early 19th century, during the reign of King Ghezo of Dahomey. The film follows the story of General Nanisca, a skilled warrior and leader of the Agojie, an all-female army that has protected the kingdom for generations. The Agojie are known for their bravery, strength, and discipline, and are feared by their enemies.\n\nThe film begins with Nanisca's backstory, which is revealed through a series of flashbacks. As a young girl, Nanisca is sold into slavery by her father, but is rescued by the Agojie and trained to be a warrior. She quickly becomes one of the most skilled and respected members of the army, and is appointed as the leader of the Agojie by King Ghezo.\n\nAs the film progresses, Nanisca and the Agojie are tasked with defending the kingdom against a series of attacks by the Portuguese and other European colonizers. The Agojie are vastly outnumbered, but they use their skills and cunning to defeat their enemies in a series of fierce battles.\n\nMeanwhile, Nanisca must also contend with the arrival of a new recruit, Nawi, who is a young and inexperienced warrior. Nanisca takes Nawi under her wing and teaches her the ways of the Agojie, but their relationship is complicated by Nawi's desire to prove herself as a warrior and Nanisca's own sense of duty and responsibility.\n\nAs the battles escalate, Nanisca and the Agojie are forced to make difficult choices and confront the harsh realities of war. The film builds towards a climactic showdown between the Agojie and their enemies, which will determine the fate of the kingdom and the future of the Agojie.\n\nCast\n\nThe Woman King features a diverse and talented cast, including:\n\n* Viola Davis as General Nanisca\n* Thuso Mbedu as Nawi\n* Lashana Lynch as Izogie\n* Sheila Atim as Alheri\n* John Boyega as Opeolu\n* Ashley Blaine Featherson as Amenza\n* Adrianna Hicks as Aneva\n* Hero Fiennes-Tiffin as King Ghezo\n* James Nesbitt as King Frederick\n\nProduction\n\n### Development\n\nThe idea for The Woman King was born out of a desire to tell the story of the Agojie, an all-female army that protected the Kingdom of Dahomey in present-day Benin, West Africa, in the early 19th century. The film's writer, Dana Stevens, was inspired by the Agojie's bravery, strength, and discipline, and saw an opportunity to create a powerful and empowering story about women in leadership.\n\nStevens worked closely with director Gina Prince-Bythewood to develop the script and bring the story to life. The two women shared a passion for telling stories about strong women and diverse communities, and saw The Woman King as an opportunity to create a film that would inspire and uplift audiences.\n\n### Filming\n\nFilming for The Woman King took place over several months in Ghana, South Africa, and the United Kingdom. The film's production team worked with a diverse cast and crew to create a rich and immersive world that would transport audiences to 19th-century Africa.\n\nThe film's cast and crew faced numerous challenges during filming, including extreme temperatures, long working hours, and limited access to resources. However, they persevered and worked together to bring the story to life.\n\n### Post-production\n\nPost-production for The Woman King took place over several months, during which time the film's editor, Terilyn A. Shropshire, worked closely with Prince-Bythewood to assemble the final cut of the film.\n\nThe film's visual effects team, led by Patrick Bell, created a range of innovative and immersive effects that brought the Agojie and their enemies to life. The team worked closely with the film's cast and crew to ensure that the effects were seamless and believable.\n\nRelease\n\nThe Woman King was released in theaters in August 2022, where it received widespread critical acclaim and commercial success. The film premiered at the Venice Film Festival, where it received a standing ovation and won several awards.\n\nThe film's release was met with a range of positive reviews, with many critics praising the film's strong performances, stunning visuals, and empowering message. The film's success was also marked by its commercial success, with it grossing over $100 million at the box office.\n\nReception\n\nThe Woman King received widespread critical acclaim and commercial success upon its release. The film holds a 93% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with many critics praising its strong performances, stunning visuals, and empowering message.\n\nMany critics praised the film's lead actress, Viola Davis, who delivered a powerful performance as General Nanisca. The film's supporting cast, including Thuso Mbedu and Lashana Lynch, also received praise for their performances.\n\nThe film's visuals were also widely praised, with many critics noting the film's stunning cinematography and innovative visual effects. The film's score, composed by Terence Blanchard, was also praised for its emotional and evocative quality.\n\nAccolades\n\nThe Woman King received several awards and nominations upon its release. The film won several awards at the Venice Film Festival, including the Grand Jury Prize and the Prize for Best Actress for Viola Davis.\n\nThe film was also nominated for several awards at the Golden Globe Awards, including Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Actress in a Motion Picture - Drama for Viola Davis.\n\nHistorical accuracy\n\nThe Woman King is a historical epic film that draws heavily from the true story of the Agojie, an all-female army that protected the Kingdom of Dahomey in present-day Benin, West Africa, in the early 19th century.\n\nWhile the film takes creative liberties with the story, it is based on extensive research and consultation with historians and experts. The film's writer, Dana Stevens, worked closely with a team of historians to ensure that the film's depiction of the Agojie and their world was as accurate as possible.\n\nCharacters\n\nThe Woman King features a range of complex and compelling characters, each with their own unique backstory and motivations. The film's lead character, General Nanisca, is a powerful and inspiring figure who embodies the values of the Agojie.\n\nThe film's supporting cast, including Nawi, Izogie, and Alheri, are also well-developed and nuanced characters who add depth and complexity to the story.\n\nRole in slavery\n\nThe Woman King explores the complex and often fraught relationship between the Agojie and slavery. The Agojie were a group of women who were trained as warriors and leaders, and who were integral to the Kingdom of Dahomey's defense against European colonizers.\n\nThe film highlights the Agojie's role in the transatlantic slave trade, and the ways in which they were complicit in the enslavement of others. The film also explores the Agojie's own experiences of slavery and oppression, and the ways in which they resisted and challenged the systems of power that sought to control them.\n\nControversy\n\nThe Woman King has been the subject of some controversy, particularly with regards to its depiction of slavery and the Agojie's role in it. Some critics have argued that the film romanticizes or trivializes the Agojie's involvement in the slave trade, and that it fails to adequately acknowledge the harm and suffering that was inflicted upon enslaved people.\n\nOthers have argued that the film's focus on the Agojie's bravery and strength is a form of cultural appropriation, and that it perpetuates a narrow and simplistic view of African history and culture.\n\nNotes\n\nThe Woman King is a powerful and thought-provoking film that explores complex themes and ideas. While it has been the subject of some controversy, it is a work of art that is worthy of consideration and reflection.\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\n* Stevens, D. (2022).

This technique has been employed by several composers throughout history, resulting in a wide range of works that showcase their mastery of tonal harmony and key signatures.\n\n**Notable Sets that Cover All 24 Keys**\n\nSeveral notable sets of music have been written to cover all 24 major and minor keys. These sets often consist of 24 individual pieces, each written in a different key, and are typically designed to demonstrate the composer's understanding of key signatures and tonal harmony.\n\n* **Bach's The Well-Tempered Clavier**: One of the most famous sets of music written in all major and minor keys is Johann Sebastian Bach's The Well-Tempered Clavier, a collection of 48 preludes and fugues in all 24 major and minor keys. Composed between 1722 and 1742, this set is considered a landmark work in the history of Western classical music and showcases Bach's mastery of counterpoint and harmony.\n* **Handel's The Harmonious Blacksmith**: George Frideric Handel's The Harmonious Blacksmith, a set of 24 preludes in all 24 major and minor keys, is another notable example of music written to cover all 24 keys. Composed in 1720, this set is considered one of Handel's lesser-known works but still showcases his mastery of tonal harmony and key signatures.\n* **Scriabin's 24 Preludes**: Alexander Scriabin's 24 Preludes, composed between 1888 and 1894, is another notable set of music written in all major and minor keys. This set is considered one of Scriabin's most important works and showcases his unique and innovative approach to tonal harmony.\n\n**Composers who Wrote Multiple Sets**\n\nSeveral composers have written multiple sets of music that cover all 24 major and minor keys. These composers often pushed the boundaries of tonal harmony and key signatures, resulting in a wide range of innovative and influential works.\n\n* **Bach**: Johann Sebastian Bach is perhaps the most famous composer to have written multiple sets of music that cover all 24 major and minor keys. In addition to The Well-Tempered Clavier, Bach also composed several other sets of music that showcase his mastery of tonal harmony and key signatures.\n* **Scriabin**: Alexander Scriabin also wrote multiple sets of music that cover all 24 major and minor keys. In addition to his 24 Preludes, Scriabin also composed several other sets of music that showcase his unique and innovative approach to tonal harmony.\n* **Rachmaninoff**: Sergei Rachmaninoff also wrote multiple sets of music that cover all 24 major and minor keys. Rachmaninoff's 24 Preludes, Op. 32, are a notable example of his work in this genre and showcase his mastery of tonal harmony and key signatures.\n\n**Variants**\n\nWhile sets of music written in all major and minor keys are typically composed of 24 individual pieces, there are several variants of this technique.\n\n* **Single Pieces that Modulate through Many Keys**: Some composers have written single pieces that modulate through many keys, often using a variety of techniques such as key changes, modulations, and tonal ambiguity.\n* **Works Covering all Eight Church Modes**: Some composers have written works that cover all 8 church modes, which are a subset of the 24 major and minor keys. These works often use a combination of modes and keys to create a unique and innovative sound.\n* **Other Sets of 24 Pieces**: In addition to the sets of music mentioned above, there are several other sets of 24 pieces that cover all 24 major and minor keys. These sets often use a variety of techniques and styles to create a unique and innovative sound.\n\n**Keys**\n\nThe order of keys in published works can vary depending on the composer and the specific work. However, there are several common patterns and traditions that have developed over time.\n\n* **Major-Minor Alternation**: One common pattern is to alternate between major and minor keys. This pattern is often used in works that are designed to be more accessible and easy to follow.\n* **Tonal Order**: Another pattern is to use the tonal order, which is the order of keys used in the major scale. This pattern is often used in works that are designed to be more complex and challenging.\n* **Chromatic Order**: Some composers have used a chromatic order, which is the order of keys used in the chromatic scale. This pattern is often used in works that are designed to be more innovative and experimental.\n\n**History**\n\nThe history of music written in all major or minor keys is a long and complex one that spans several centuries.\n\n* **Bach and his Precursors**: Johann Sebastian Bach was influenced by several earlier composers, including Jean-Philippe Rameau and Georg Philipp Telemann. These composers often wrote music that covered multiple keys and modes, laying the foundation for Bach's later work.\n* **After Bach**: After Bach's death in 1750, several composers continued to write music that covered multiple keys and modes. This period saw the rise of composers such as Haydn and Mozart, who often used a variety of techniques and styles to create innovative and influential works.\n* **18th and 19th Centuries**: The 18th and 19th centuries saw a significant increase in the use of multiple keys and modes in music. Composers such as Beethoven and Brahms often used a variety of techniques and styles to create complex and innovative works.\n* **20th Century**: The 20th century saw a significant shift in the use of multiple keys and modes in music. Composers such as Scriabin and Rachmaninoff often used a variety of techniques and styles to create innovative and influential works.\n* **21st Century**: In the 21st century, composers continue to push the boundaries of music written in all major or minor keys. This period has seen the rise of a wide range of innovative and influential composers, from jazz and rock to classical and electronic music.\n\n**Notes**\n\nMusic written in all major or minor keys is a complex and nuanced genre that has evolved over several centuries. From Bach to Scriabin and beyond, this genre has been shaped by a wide range of composers and styles. While there are many common patterns and traditions, there is also a great deal of diversity and innovation in this genre.\n\n**References**\n\n* \n* \n* \n\n**External Links**\n\n*", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The film follows the same format as its predecessors, featuring a group of friends performing a series of outrageous and often painful stunts.\n\n**Synopsis**\n\nThe film's plot revolves around the Jackass crew, led by Johnny Knoxville, Jackass's creator and main star, as they attempt to recapture their youthful energy and spirit through a series of absurd and often self-destructive stunts. The film features a mix of new and returning cast members, including Steve-O, Jason \"Wee Man\" Acuña, Preston Lacy, Dave England, and Jeff Tremaine, among others.\n\n**Cast**\n\nThe film features a mix of returning and new cast members, including:\n\n### Guest appearances\n\n* Spike Jonze\n* Eric André\n* Machine Gun Kelly\n* Tony Hawk\n* Travis Barker\n* Demi Lovato\n* Mark Wiens\n* Jachin Paquette\n* Sean Cliver\n* Jason \"Wee Man\" Acuña\n* David \"Boyka\" Boyanov\n* Tony Hawk\n* Weezer\n\n### Crew\n\n* Director: Jeff Tremaine\n* Producers: Jeff Tremaine, Spike Jonze, Johnny Knoxville, Preston Lacy, Dave England, Jason \"Wee Man\" Acuña, and Jeff T. Miller\n* Writers: Jeff Tremaine, Spike Jonze, Johnny Knoxville, Preston Lacy, Dave England, Jason \"Wee Man\" Acuña, and Jeff T. Miller\n* Cinematography: Dimitry Elyashkevich\n* Editing: Matthew Kosinski\n* Music: The Glitch Mob, Trent Reznor, and Atticus Ross\n\n**Production**\n\n### Development\n\nThe idea for Jackass Forever was conceived in 2019, shortly after the release of Jackass 3D. The film's script was written by the Jackass crew, with input from Spike Jonze and Jeff Tremaine. The project was greenlit by Paramount Pictures in 2020, with a budget of $25 million.\n\n### Bam Margera's firing\n\nIn October 2021, it was announced that Bam Margera had been fired from the film due to a public dispute with the rest of the cast and crew. Margera had been a key member of the Jackass crew since the early 2000s, but his behavior had become increasingly erratic and troublesome in recent years.\n\n### Casting\n\nThe film's casting process was a long and grueling process, with the Jackass crew holding auditions and workshops to find new talent. The final cast was announced in December 2021, with a mix of new and returning cast members.\n\n### Filming\n\nPrincipal photography for Jackass Forever began in January 2022 and wrapped in April 2022. The film was shot on location in California, Nevada, and Utah, with a mix of stunts and practical effects.\n\n### Injuries\n\nAs with the previous Jackass films, the crew suffered a number of injuries during filming, including broken bones, concussions, and lacerations.

Kennedy**\n\nThe assassination of John F. Kennedy, the 35th President of the United States, occurred on November 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas. Kennedy was shot while riding in an open-top car in a motorcade through Dealey Plaza, a public park in downtown Dallas. The assassination was a pivotal event in American history, leading to widespread shock, mourning, and conspiracy theories.\n\n**Background**\n\n**Kennedy**\n\nJohn F. Kennedy, the 35th President of the United States, was born on May 29, 1917, in Brookline, Massachusetts. He graduated from Harvard University in 1940 and served in the U.S. Navy during World War II. Kennedy was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1946 and to the U.S. Senate in 1952. He became the youngest person to be elected President of the United States in 1960, defeating Republican candidate Richard Nixon.\n\n**Oswald**\n\nLee Harvey Oswald, the alleged assassin of President Kennedy, was born on October 18, 1939, in New Orleans, Louisiana. Oswald was a former Marine who had defected to the Soviet Union in 1959 but returned to the United States in 1962. He was employed at the Texas School Book Depository in Dallas, where he had access to the sixth floor, from which the shots were fired.\n\n**November 22**\n\n**Kennedy's arrival in Dallas and route to Dealey Plaza**\n\nPresident Kennedy arrived in Dallas on November 22, 1963, aboard Air Force One. He was greeted by Texas Governor John Connally and his wife, Nellie. The President and Governor Connally rode in the Presidential motorcade, a procession of cars through downtown Dallas, to Dealey Plaza, a public park in the heart of the city.\n\n**Shooting**\n\nAt 12:30 PM Central Standard Time, the motorcade turned onto Elm Street, a two-lane street in Dealey Plaza. As the car turned onto Elm Street, shots rang out from the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository building, located on the north side of Elm Street. President Kennedy was hit in the head and neck by multiple bullets, and Governor Connally was also injured.\n\n**Aftermath in Dealey Plaza**\n\nThe motorcade sped away from the scene, with Secret Service agents and police officers shielding the President and Governor Connally. The car sped to Parkland Memorial Hospital, where President Kennedy was pronounced dead at 1:00 PM. Governor Connally was also taken to Parkland Memorial Hospital, where he underwent surgery.\n\n**Oswald's flight, killing of J. D. Tippit, and arrest**\n\nLee Harvey Oswald fled the Texas School Book Depository building and disappeared into the crowd. He boarded a bus and later transferred to another bus, which stopped at a bus station in the Oak Cliff neighborhood of Dallas. Oswald shot and killed Dallas Police Officer J. D. Tippit, who had stopped him for questioning, at 1:45 PM. Oswald then fled on foot, but was eventually arrested by Dallas Police Officer M. L. Baker at 1:50 PM at", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The government has enforced strict dress codes, prohibiting women from wearing revealing clothing, such as tight-fitting tops or short skirts. Women who fail to comply with these rules face arrest, fines, and even imprisonment. The morality police, also known as the Gasht-e Ershad, are responsible for enforcing these laws and have been accused of abusing their power and targeting women from marginalized communities.\n\n### Protest movements under the Islamic Republic\n\nProtests in Iran have a long history, dating back to the early days of the Islamic Revolution. Over the years, various groups have emerged to challenge the government's policies and demand greater freedoms. These protests have often been met with violence and repression, with many participants facing arrest, detention, and even death. Despite this, the protests have continued, with many Iranians using social media and other forms of communication to mobilize support and share their message.\n\n### Mahsa Amini's arrest and death in custody\n\nMahsa Amini was a 22-year-old Kurdish Iranian woman who was arrested by the morality police on September 13, 2022, for allegedly violating the country's strict dress code. She was taken into custody and held at a police station, where she died three days later, on September 16, 2022. The exact circumstances of her death are disputed, with some reports suggesting that she was beaten by police and others that she suffered a heart attack. Her death sparked widespread outrage and protests across Iran, with many Iranians demanding greater freedoms and an end to the morality police's abuses.\n\n**Protests**\n\n### Slogans and grievances\n\nThe protests that erupted across Iran in response to Mahsa Amini's death were marked by a range of slogans and grievances. Protesters demanded greater freedoms, an end to the morality police's abuses, and an independent investigation into Amini's death. Many protesters also called for the removal of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the establishment of a secular government. The protests were led by women, who played a key role in organizing and mobilizing support for the movement.\n\n### Iranian public opinion\n\nPublic opinion in Iran is complex and divided, with many Iranians supporting the protests and others opposing them. Some Iranians see the protests as a legitimate expression of dissent and a call for greater freedoms, while others view them as a threat to national stability and security. The government has sought to portray the protests as a foreign-backed conspiracy, but many Iranians see through this narrative and recognize the protests as a genuine expression of popular discontent.\n\n### Protest techniques\n\nThe protests that erupted across Iran in response to Mahsa Amini's death employed a range of techniques, from peaceful demonstrations to violent confrontations with security forces. Protesters used social media to mobilize support and share their message, and many participants wore masks and used other forms of protection to avoid identification and arrest. The protests were also marked by the use of graffiti and other forms of street art, which served as a powerful symbol of resistance and defiance.\n\n### Civil boycotts\n\nIn addition to the protests, many Iranians engaged in civil boycotts, refusing to participate in government-organized events and calling for a boycott of government-owned businesses. These boycotts were a powerful expression of dissent and a call for greater freedoms, and they helped to further mobilize support for the protests.\n\n### Media Western coverage\n\nThe protests that erupted across Iran in response to Mahsa Amini's death received significant coverage in Western media outlets, which portrayed the protests as a legitimate expression of dissent and a call for greater freedoms. Many Western leaders, including the United States and European Union, issued statements condemning the government's response to the protests and calling for greater freedoms and human rights in Iran.\n\n**Casualties, government response**\n\n### Casualties\n\nThe government's response to the protests was marked by violence and repression, with many protesters facing arrest, detention, and even death. Estimates suggest that hundreds of protesters were killed, with many more injured and arrested. The government's use of force was widespread, with reports of security forces firing live ammunition and using tear gas to disperse protesters.\n\n### Government casualties\n\nThe government also suffered casualties during the protests, with reports of security forces being injured and killed in clashes with protesters. However, the exact number of government casualties is disputed, and many reports suggest that the government has exaggerated its losses in order to justify its response to the protests.\n\n### Arrests and death sentences\n\nIn addition to the protesters who were killed, many others were arrested and charged with crimes related to their participation in the protests. Some were sentenced to death or long prison terms, while others were released on bail or pardoned. The government's use of the death penalty and long prison sentences was a powerful tool of repression, and it helped to further chill dissent and opposition in Iran.\n\n### Executions\n\nReports suggest that several protesters were executed in the aftermath of the protests, with many more facing execution on charges related to their participation in the protests. The use of the death penalty was a powerful symbol of the government's willingness to use violence and repression to crush dissent and opposition.\n\n### Suspected food poisoning\n\nThere were reports of suspected food poisoning among university students and schoolgirls who participated in the protests. Many participants reported feeling ill and experiencing symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea, and some were hospitalized. The exact cause of the suspected food poisoning was disputed, but many reports suggested that it was related to the government's use of tear gas and other chemicals to disperse protesters.\n\n### University students\n\nUniversity students played a key role in the protests, with many participating in demonstrations and other forms of activism. The government's response to the protests was marked by violence and repression, with many students facing arrest, detention, and even death. The use of university students as a symbol of resistance and defiance was a powerful expression of dissent and a call for greater freedoms.\n\n### Schoolgirls\n\nSchoolgirls also participated in the protests, with many joining demonstrations and other forms of activism. The government's response to the protests was marked by violence and repression, with many schoolgirls facing arrest, detention, and even death. The use of schoolgirls as a symbol of resistance and defiance was a powerful expression of dissent and a call for greater freedoms.\n\n**Statements by officials**\n\nGovernment officials made a range of statements in response to the protests, including calls for calm and restraint and accusations of foreign interference. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei issued a statement condemning the protests and accusing them of being a foreign-backed conspiracy. President Ebrahim Raisi also issued a statement calling for calm and restraint, but his words were widely seen as empty and unconvincing.\n\n**Government strategy and tactics**\n\nThe government's response to the protests was marked by a range of strategies and tactics, including the use of force, propaganda, and repression. The government used security forces to disperse protesters and arrested many participants, while also using propaganda to discredit the protests and portray them as a foreign-backed conspiracy. The government also used repression to crush dissent and opposition, with many protesters facing arrest, detention, and even death.\n\n**Communications blackouts**\n\nThe government also used communications blackouts to disrupt the protests and prevent protesters from organizing and mobilizing support. Many internet and social media platforms were blocked, and phone lines were cut off in some areas. The use of communications blackouts was a powerful tool of repression, and it helped to further chill dissent and opposition in Iran.\n\n**Response by regime supporters**\n\nSome regime supporters responded to the protests by accusing protesters of being foreign-backed agents and calling for their arrest and punishment. Others issued statements condemning the protests and calling for calm and restraint. The use of rhetoric and propaganda was a powerful tool of repression, and it helped to further chill dissent and opposition in Iran.\n\n**Government campaign for public opinion**\n\nThe government also launched a campaign to win public opinion and discredit the protests. The campaign included the use of propaganda, media manipulation, and repression, and it was aimed at portraying the protests as a foreign-backed conspiracy and a threat to national stability and security. The use of a campaign to win public opinion was a powerful tool of repression, and it helped to further chill dissent and opposition in Iran.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\n### Lack of head covering\n\nIn the aftermath of the protests, many women in Iran began to abandon the traditional head covering, a powerful symbol of resistance and defiance. The use of a head covering was a long-standing requirement in Iran, and its abandonment was a powerful expression of dissent and a call for greater freedoms. The government responded to the abandonment of head coverings with repression and violence, but many women continued to defy the rules and wear their hair uncovered.\n\n### Crackdown\n\nThe government also launched a crackdown on protesters and dissidents, arresting many and charging them with crimes related to their participation in the protests. The crackdown was a powerful tool of repression, and it helped to further chill dissent and opposition in Iran.\n\n### Surveillance of protesters and dissidents\n\nThe government also used surveillance to monitor protesters and dissidents, using a range of tools and techniques to track their movements and activities. The use of surveillance was a powerful tool of repression, and it helped to further chill dissent and opposition in Iran.\n\n**Analysis**\n\nThe Mahsa Amini protests were a complex and multifaceted movement, driven by a range of grievances and demands. The protests were marked by a range of techniques, from peaceful demonstrations to violent confrontations with security forces. The government's response to the protests was also complex and multifaceted, involving the use of force, propaganda, and repression. The use of a range of strategies and tactics was a powerful tool of repression, and it helped to further chill dissent and opposition in Iran.\n\n**International reactions**\n\n### International organizations\n\nInternational organizations, including the United Nations and human rights groups, issued statements condemning the government's response to the protests and calling for greater freedoms and human rights in Iran. The use of international pressure and diplomacy was a powerful tool of leverage, and it helped to further mobilize support for the protests.\n\n### Diplomatic ties\n\nMany countries, including the United States and European Union, issued statements condemning the government's response to the protests and calling for greater freedoms and human rights in Iran. The use of diplomatic ties was a powerful tool of leverage, and it helped to further mobilize support for the protests.\n\n### Human rights advocates\n\nHuman rights advocates, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, issued statements condemning the government's response to the protests and calling for greater freedoms and human rights in Iran. The use of human rights advocacy was a powerful tool of leverage, and it helped to further mobilize support for the protests.\n\n### Sanctions\n\nSome countries, including the United States and European Union, imposed sanctions on Iran in response to the government's response to the protests. The use of sanctions was a powerful tool of leverage, and it helped to further chill dissent and opposition in Iran.\n\n**In popular culture**\n\n### Music\n\nMusic played a key role in the protests, with many protesters using music as a form of expression and activism. Some musicians, including the Iranian rock band, Kiosk, issued statements condemning the government's response to the protests and calling for greater freedoms and human rights in Iran.\n\n### Sports\n\nSports also played a key role in the protests, with many athletes and sports organizations issuing statements condemning the government's response to the protests and calling for greater freedoms and human rights in Iran. The use of sports as a form of activism was a powerful tool of leverage, and it helped to further mobilize support for the protests.\n\n### 2022 FIFA World Cup\n\nThe 2022 FIFA World Cup was a major event that took place in Qatar in 2022, and it was attended by many Iranian athletes and fans. The use of the World Cup as a platform for activism was a powerful tool of leverage, and it helped to further mobilize support for the protests.\n\n### Commercialism\n\nThe commercialism surrounding the World Cup was also a major issue, with many critics accusing FIFA and other sponsors of exploiting the event for financial gain.
