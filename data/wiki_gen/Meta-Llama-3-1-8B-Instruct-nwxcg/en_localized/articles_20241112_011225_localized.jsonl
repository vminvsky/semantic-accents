He is a member of the United National Party (UNP) and has been a key figure in Sri Lankan politics for several decades.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nRanil Wickremesinghe was born on March 24, 1949, in Colombo, Sri Lanka. His father, Esmond Wickremesinghe, was a Sri Lankan politician and a member of the UNP. Wickremesinghe was educated at Royal College, Colombo, and later at the University of Ceylon, where he graduated with a degree in Law.\n\n**Political Career**\n\nWickremesinghe entered politics in the 1970s and quickly rose through the ranks of the UNP. He became a member of the party's Working Committee in 1978 and was elected to the Parliament of Sri Lanka in 1977.\n\n### Batalanda Incident\n\nIn 1990, Wickremesinghe was involved in the Batalanda incident, in which he was accused of allowing the military to use a UNP-controlled resort in Colombo to interrogate and torture suspected LTTE members.

Located on the western coast of the island, Lahaina is a popular tourist destination known for its rich history, cultural attractions, and natural beauty.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n### Name\n\n#### Modern name, etymology and pronunciations\n\nThe modern name \"Lahaina\" is derived from the Hawaiian language, where \"Lahaina\" means \"cruel\" or \"unhappy.\" The name is believed to have been given to the area by early Hawaiian settlers due to the harsh conditions and challenging terrain. In Hawaiian, the pronunciation of Lahaina is approximately \"LA-hah-nah,\" with a focus on the first syllable.\n\n#### Ancient names\n\nPrior to the arrival of European explorers, Lahaina was known by several different names. The ancient Hawaiians called the area \"Lelepono,\" which translates to \"the place of the god.\" Other names for the area included \"Lelepono-Olowalu,\" which referred to the area's connection to the Olowalu God, and \"Lelepono-Koai,\" which referred to the area's connection to the Koai God.\n\n### Early rulers\n\nLahaina has a rich and complex history that dates back to the earliest days of Hawaiian settlement. The area was first settled by the Ma'o people, who arrived on the island of Maui in the 10th century. The Ma'o people were skilled farmers and fishermen, and they established a thriving community in the Lahaina area.\n\nOver time, the Ma'o people were displaced by the Ali'i Nui, a group of powerful chiefs who ruled over the island of Maui. The Ali'i Nui were known for their wisdom, bravery, and spiritual power, and they played a significant role in the development of Hawaiian culture.\n\n### Western contact\n\n#### Kahekili II\n\nThe first recorded contact between Europeans and the people of Lahaina occurred in 1778, when British explorer Captain James Cook arrived on the island of Maui. Cook was initially welcomed by the people of Lahaina, but his presence ultimately led to conflict and tragedy.\n\nOne of the most significant figures in the early history of Lahaina was Kahekili II, a powerful Ali'i Nui who ruled over the island of Maui in the 18th century. Kahekili II was known for his bravery, wisdom, and spiritual power, and he played a significant role in the development of Hawaiian culture.\n\n#### Kamehameha I and Kamehameha II\n\nIn the late 18th century, the island of Maui was united under the rule of King Kamehameha I, who was determined to create a unified and powerful Hawaiian kingdom. Kamehameha I conquered the island of Maui in 1790, and he established his capital in Hawaii Island.\n\nKamehameha I's son, Kamehameha II, succeeded him as king and continued his father's policies of unifying the Hawaiian Islands. Kamehameha II was known for his bravery, wisdom, and spiritual power, and he played a significant role in the development of Hawaiian culture.\n\n#### Christian missionaries\n\nThe first Christian missionaries arrived in Lahaina in the early 19th century, and they had a significant impact on the area's culture and society. The missionaries introduced Western education, medicine, and technology to the area, and they helped to establish a thriving Christian community.\n\nHowever, the missionaries also brought with them a number of negative consequences, including the suppression of traditional Hawaiian practices and the introduction of Western diseases that decimated the native population.\n\n#### Whaling\n\nIn the early 19th century, Lahaina became a major whaling port, with numerous whaling ships arriving in the area to hunt and process whales. The whaling industry brought significant economic growth to the area, but it also had a number of negative consequences, including the destruction of the marine ecosystem and the exploitation of the native population.\n\n#### Kamehameha III\n\nKamehameha III succeeded his brother, Kamehameha II, as king and continued his policies of unifying the Hawaiian Islands. Kamehameha III was known for his bravery, wisdom, and spiritual power, and he played a significant role in the development of Hawaiian culture.\n\nDuring his reign, Kamehameha III established a number of important institutions, including the Hawaiian-language newspaper Ka Nonanona and the Hawaiian-language school Lahainaluna. He also introduced a number of important policies, including the establishment of a national education system and the creation of a national park service.\n\n#### 20th century\n\nIn the 20th century, Lahaina underwent significant changes, including the decline of the whaling industry and the rise of the tourist industry. The area became a popular destination for tourists, who were drawn to its rich history, cultural attractions, and natural beauty.\n\nHowever, the area also faced a number of challenges, including the decline of traditional Hawaiian culture and the exploitation of the native population. In the 1960s and 1970s, a number of Hawaiian activists organized protests and demonstrations to demand greater rights and recognition for Native Hawaiians.\n\n### 2023 wildfire\n\nIn 2023, a devastating wildfire swept through the Lahaina area, destroying hundreds of homes and businesses. The wildfire was one of the worst in Hawaiian history, and it had a significant impact on the local community.\n\nGeography\n--------\n\n### Climate\n\nLahaina has a tropical savanna climate, with high temperatures and high levels of humidity throughout the year. The area experiences a significant amount of rainfall, with an average annual rainfall of over 40 inches.\n\nDemographics\n------------\n\nAs of the 2020 census, the population of Lahaina is approximately 11,000 people. The area is predominantly white, with a small percentage of Native Hawaiians and other ethnic groups.\n\nArts and culture\n----------------\n\nLahaina is home to a thriving arts and cultural scene, with a number of galleries, museums, and performance venues. The area is known for its traditional Hawaiian music and dance, including the popular hula dance.\n\nSports\n------\n\nLahaina is home to a number of sports teams and facilities, including the Lahaina Civic Center, which hosts a number of sports events and tournaments throughout the year.\n\nPopular culture\n--------------\n\nLahaina has been featured in a number of popular culture productions, including films, television shows, and music videos. The area is known for its beautiful scenery and rich history, and it has been a popular location for filmmakers and photographers.\n\nGallery\n-------\n\n*   [Image: Lahaina, Hawaii.jpg|thumb|250px|Lahaina, Hawaii]\n*   [Image: Lahaina Harbor.jpg|thumb|250px|Lahaina Harbor]\n*   [Image: Lahaina Banyan Tree.jpg|thumb|250px|Lahaina Banyan Tree]\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n*   [Hawaii]\n*   [Maui]\n*   [Lahaina Civic Center]\n*   [Lahainaluna]\n*   [Ka Nonanona]\n\nNotes\n------\n\nThis article uses material from the Wikipedia article \"Lahaina, Hawaii,\" which is released under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share-Alike License 3.0.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nThis article does not cite any references.\n\nExternal links\n---------------\n\n*   [Official website of the Town of Lahaina]\n*   [Lahaina Visitor and Cultural Center]", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

Established in 1986 by the French magazine Montagnes Magazine, the Piolets d'Or are considered the most important award in the field of alpinism.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Piolets d'Or were first awarded in 1986, with the winners being the climbers Reinhold Messner, Peter Habeler, and Jerzy Kukuczka. The award was created to recognize the achievements of climbers who have pushed the boundaries of alpinism and have made significant contributions to the sport.\n\nMultiple winners\n\nOver the years, the Piolets d'Or have been awarded to numerous climbers who have made significant contributions to alpinism. Some of the most notable winners include:\n\n* Reinhold Messner, who has won the award a record four times\n* Jerzy Kukuczka, who won the award twice\n* Pierre Beghin, who won the award three times\n* Ueli Steck, who won the award twice\n* Adam Ondra, who won the award in 2017\n\nCriteria\n\nThe Piolets d'Or are awarded to climbers who have made significant contributions to alpinism, including:\n\n* First ascents of previously unclimbed peaks\n* New routes on existing peaks\n* Significant improvements to existing routes\n* Climbing achievements in extreme conditions\n\nReception\n\nThe Piolets d'Or are widely recognized as the most prestigious award in the field of alpinism. The winners are often celebrated as heroes and are widely recognized for their achievements. However, the award has also been subject to criticism and controversy over the years.\n\nCriticism\n\nOne of the criticisms of the Piolets d'Or is that they are often awarded to climbers who have made significant contributions to alpinism, but who may not have made the most significant contributions to the sport as a whole. Some critics argue that the award should be given to climbers who have made significant contributions to the development of alpinism, rather than just to those who have achieved great feats in the mountains.\n\n2023 award (31st awards)\n\nThe 31st Piolets d'Or were awarded in 2023 to the climbers Alex Honnold and Tommy Caldwell for their first ascent of the Freerider route on El Capitan in Yosemite National Park.\n\n2022 award (30th awards)\n\nThe 30th Piolets d'Or were awarded in 2022 to the climbers Nirmal Purja and David Goettler for their first ascent of the Nanga Parbat north face in Pakistan.\n\n2021 award\n\nThe 29th Piolets d'Or were awarded in 2021 to the climbers Christof Schauer and Johannes Schulze for their first ascent of the K2 north face in Pakistan.\n\n2020 award\n\nThe 28th Piolets d'Or were awarded in 2020 to the climbers Ueli Steck and Raphaël Slawinski for their first ascent of the Annapurna south face in Nepal.\n\n2019 award (deaths of Lama and Auer)\n\nThe 27th Piolets d'Or were awarded in 2019 to the climbers Alison Hargreaves and Dave Watson for their first ascent of the K2 north west ridge in Pakistan. However, the award was tainted by the deaths of the climbers Nirmal Purja and David Goettler on the Annapurna north face in Nepal, which occurred just days after the award ceremony.\n\n2018 award (leaves France)\n\nThe 26th Piolets d'Or were awarded in 2018 to the climbers Ueli Steck and Raphaël Slawinski for their first ascent of the Annapurna south face in Nepal. However, the award ceremony was held in the United States for the first time, marking a departure from the traditional French location.\n\n2017 award\n\nThe 25th Piolets d'Or were awarded in 2017 to the climbers Adam Ondra and David Goettler for their first ascent of the Eiger north face in Switzerland.\n\n2016 award\n\nThe 24th Piolets d'Or were awarded in 2016 to the climbers Ueli Steck and Raphaël Slawinski for their first ascent of the Annapurna south face in Nepal.\n\n2015 award (pre-announced)\n\nThe 23rd Piolets d'Or were awarded in 2015 to the climbers Alex Honnold and Tommy Caldwell for their first ascent of the Freerider route on El Capitan in Yosemite National Park. However, the award was pre-announced, sparking controversy among climbers and mountaineers.\n\n2014 award\n\nThe 22nd Piolets d'Or were awarded in 2014 to the climbers Reinhold Messner and Peter Habeler for their first ascent of the K2 north face in Pakistan.\n\n2013 award (everybody wins)\n\nThe 21st Piolets d'Or were awarded in 2013 to all climbers who had made significant contributions to alpinism in the previous year.

However, the award was given under a new charter, which sparked controversy and criticism among climbers and mountaineers.\n\n2008 award (cancelled)\n\nThe 16th Piolets d'Or were cancelled in 2008 due to controversy and criticism among climbers and mountaineers.\n\n2007 award (controversy)\n\nThe 15th Piolets d'Or were awarded in 2007 to the climbers Alex Honnold and Tommy Caldwell for their first ascent of the Freerider route on El Capitan in Yosemite National Park. However, the award was tainted by controversy and criticism among climbers and mountaineers.\n\nPre-2007 (only one winner)\n\nPrior to 2007, the Piolets d'Or were awarded to only one climber per year. The award was given to climbers who had made significant contributions to alpinism, but the criteria for the award were not well-defined and were often subjective.\n\nSee also\n\n* List of Piolets d'Or winners\n* List of first ascents\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\n* \"The Piolets d'Or: A History\" by Reinhold Messner\n* \"The Piolets d'Or: A Guide to the Most Prestigious Award in Alpinism\" by Ueli Steck\n* \"The Piolets d'Or: A Critical Analysis\" by David Goettler\n\nExternal links\n\n* Official website of the Piolets d'Or\n* List of Piolets d'Or winners on the official website\n* List of first ascents on the official website", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The region had previously been a part of the Ottoman Empire, but after a series of wars and conflicts, the Habsburg Monarchy gained control over the area and created the Banat of Craiova.\n\n**History**\n\nThe Banat of Craiova had a complex and tumultuous history, marked by several periods of conflict and change.\n\n### Austrian Conquest\n\nIn 1690, the Habsburgs, under the leadership of Emperor Leopold I, launched a campaign to conquer the Ottoman Empire's territories in Eastern Europe. The war, known as the Great Turkish War, lasted for several years and resulted in significant territorial gains for the Habsburgs. In 1692, the Habsburgs captured the city of Craiova, which became the capital of the new Banat.\n\n### Government Creation\n\nAfter the conquest, the Habsburgs established a new government in the Banat, with a viceroy appointed by the emperor. The viceroy was responsible for administering the region and enforcing Habsburg laws and policies. The government was also responsible for collecting taxes and maintaining order in the region.\n\n### Boyar and Peasant Resistance\n\nDespite the Habsburgs' efforts to establish a stable government, the region was marked by significant resistance from the local boyar class and peasants. The boyars, who were members of the traditional nobility, resisted the Habsburgs' attempts to impose their authority and taxes on the region. The peasants, who were the majority of the population, also resisted the Habsburgs' efforts to collect taxes and enforce their laws.\n\n### Austrian Consolidation\n\nIn the early 18th century, the Habsburgs made significant efforts to consolidate their control over the Banat. They established a new administrative system, with a governor appointed by the emperor. The governor was responsible for administering the region and enforcing Habsburg laws and policies. The Habsburgs also established a new army in the region, which was responsible for maintaining order and defending the region against external threats.\n\n### Ottoman Reconquest\n\nIn 1718, the Ottoman Empire, under the leadership of Sultan Ahmed III, launched a campaign to reconquer the Banat. The war, known as the War of the Quadruple Alliance, lasted for several years and resulted in significant territorial losses for the Habsburgs. In 1738, the Ottomans captured the city of Craiova, which marked the end of the Habsburgs' control over the Banat.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nThe Banat of Craiova had a significant legacy in the region, marking the beginning of a new era of Habsburg rule in Eastern Europe.\n\n### \"Colonial\" Precedent\n\nThe establishment of the Banat of Craiova marked an important precedent for the Habsburgs' colonial policies in Eastern Europe. The region was seen as a model for the Habsburgs' efforts to establish a stable and prosperous colony in the region. The Habsburgs' policies in the Banat, including the establishment of a new government and the imposition of taxes, set a precedent for their policies in other colonies in Eastern Europe.\n\n### Cultural Survivals\n\nDespite the Habsburgs' efforts to impose their culture and language on the region, the Banat of Craiova saw significant cultural survivals from the Ottoman period. The region's architecture, cuisine, and traditions continued to reflect the Ottoman influence, and many of the region's inhabitants continued to speak the Romanian language.\n\n**Symbols**\n\nThe Banat of Craiova had several symbols that reflected its history and culture.\n\n* The flag of the Banat of Craiova featured a red and white design, with a black eagle in the center.\n* The coat of arms of the Banat of Craiova featured a shield with a black eagle on top of a red and white diagonal cross.\n* The motto of the Banat of Craiova was \"Fortis et Liber\" (Strong and Free).\n\n**Notes**\n\nThe Banat of Craiova was a significant region in the history of Eastern Europe, marked by a complex and tumultuous history. The region's legacy continues to be felt in the region today, with many of its traditions and customs continuing to reflect the Ottoman influence.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The election was the 15th general election since Malaysia gained independence in 1957.\n\n**Background**\n\n### **Previous election**\n\nThe previous general election was held in 2018, when the Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition won a majority of seats in the Dewan Rakyat. However, the PH government lasted only 22 months before being dissolved due to a constitutional crisis.\n\n### **Significant events**\n\nA series of significant events led up to the 2022 general election. In 2020, Malaysia was hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, which had a profound impact on the country's economy and social fabric. The government's response to the pandemic was widely criticized, leading to a decline in popular support for the ruling coalition, Perikatan Nasional (PN).\n\nIn 2021, the PN government was rocked by a series of scandals, including the 1MDB scandal, which led to the resignation of several high-ranking officials. The opposition parties seized on these scandals to attack the government, further eroding its support.\n\n### **2020–22 political crisis**\n\nThe 2020-22 political crisis in Malaysia was a period of significant political upheaval, marked by the collapse of the PH government, the rise of the PN coalition, and a series of constitutional crises. The crisis began in 2020, when the PH government, led by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, was dissolved due to a constitutional crisis.\n\nThe PN coalition, led by Muhyiddin Yassin, won a confidence vote in the Dewan Rakyat, but its government was short-lived. In 2021, the PN government was rocked by a series of scandals, including the 1MDB scandal, which led to the resignation of several high-ranking officials.\n\nThe opposition parties, led by Anwar Ibrahim, seized on these scandals to attack the government, further eroding its support. The crisis culminated in the 2022 general election, which saw the PH coalition win a majority of seats in the Dewan Rakyat.\n\n**Electoral system**\n\nThe Malaysian electoral system is a first-past-the-post system, where the candidate with the most votes in a constituency wins the seat. The election is held every five years, unless the government is dissolved by the King or the Dewan Rakyat is dissolved by a vote of no confidence.\n\n**Timeline**\n\n### **Dissolution of parliament**\n\nThe Dewan Rakyat was dissolved on 10 October 2022, ahead of the general election. The dissolution was announced by the King, following a request from the Prime Minister, Ismail Sabri Yaakob.\n\n### **Dissolution of state legislatures**\n\nThe state legislatures were also dissolved on 10 October 2022, ahead of the general election. The dissolution was announced by the King, following a request from the Prime Minister.\n\n### **Pre-nomination events**\n\nBefore the general election, several events took place that had a significant impact on the election. The opposition parties, led by Anwar Ibrahim, announced their list of candidates, while the ruling coalition, PN, announced its list of candidates.\n\nThe opposition parties also launched a series of campaigns, including a \"Malaysian-style\" campaign, which aimed to appeal to the Malay voters. The ruling coalition, on the other hand, launched a campaign focused on the economy and national security.\n\n### **Timetable**\n\nThe timetable for the general election was as follows:\n\n* 10 October 2022: Dissolution of parliament and state legislatures\n* 11 October 2022: Nomination day\n* 19 November 2022: Election day\n* 21 November 2022: Counting day\n\n**Last election pendulum**\n\nThe last election pendulum, published by the Malaysian Insight, showed that the opposition parties had a slight advantage in the election. The pendulum showed that the opposition parties had 128 seats, while the ruling coalition had 114 seats.\n\n**Political parties and candidates**\n\n### **Parties represented in current legislatures**\n\nThe following parties were represented in the current legislatures:\n\n* Pakatan Harapan (PH)\n* Perikatan Nasional (PN)\n* Barisan Nasional (BN)\n* Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (BERSATU)\n* Parti Islam Se-Malaysia (PAS)\n\n### **Extra-parliamentary parties**\n\nThe following parties were not represented in the current legislatures but contested in the election:\n\n* Parti Amanah Negara (AMANAH)\n* Parti Sarawak Bersatu (PSB)\n* Parti Bumi Kenyalang (PBK)\n* Parti Sosialis Malaysia (PSM)\n\n### **Nominated candidates**\n\nA total of 1,472 candidates were nominated for the general election. The highest number of candidates, 248, were nominated in the state of Sabah.\n\n**Campaign**\n\n### **Timing of election**\n\nThe election was held on 19 November 2022, which was a Saturday. The election was originally scheduled to be held on 12 November 2022, but it was postponed to 19 November 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n### **Youth vote**\n\nThe youth vote was a crucial factor in the election. The opposition parties, led by Anwar Ibrahim, launched a series of campaigns focused on the youth, including a \"Malaysian-style\" campaign. The ruling coalition, on the other hand, launched a campaign focused on the economy and national security.\n\n**Outgoing members of parliament**\n\nA total of 222 members of parliament were not re-elected in the 2022 general election. The highest number of outgoing members, 44, were from the state of Sabah.\n\n**Opinion polls**\n\nThe opinion polls conducted before the election showed that the opposition parties had a slight advantage. The polls showed that the opposition parties had a lead of between 2-5% over the ruling coalition.\n\n**Results**\n\n### **By alliance**\n\nThe results of the election by alliance were as follows:\n\n* Pakatan Harapan (PH): 152 seats (56.2%)\n* Perikatan Nasional (PN): 73 seats (27.3%)\n* Barisan Nasional (BN): 30 seats (11.2%)\n* Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (BERSATU): 31 seats (11.6%)\n* Parti Islam Se-Malaysia (PAS): 49 seats (18.3%)\n\n### **By parliamentary seats**\n\nThe results of the election by parliamentary seat were as follows:\n\n* Total seats: 222\n* PH: 152 seats (68.4%)\n* PN: 73 seats (32.9%)\n* BN: 30 seats (13.5%)\n* BERSATU: 31 seats (14%)\n* PAS: 49 seats (22%)\n\n### **State assemblies**\n\nThe results of the election by state assembly were as follows:\n\n* Total seats: 576\n* PH: 342 seats (59.4%)\n* PN: 163 seats (28.3%)\n* BN: 32 seats (5.6%)\n* BERSATU: 36 seats (6.3%)\n* PAS: 57 seats (9.9%)\n\n### **Seats that changed allegiance**\n\nA total of 54 seats changed allegiance in the 2022 general election. The highest number of seats, 23, changed allegiance from the PN coalition to the PH coalition.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\n### **Formation of federal government**\n\nThe PH coalition, led by Anwar Ibrahim, formed the federal government after the election. Anwar Ibrahim was sworn in as the 10th Prime Minister of Malaysia on 24 November 2022.\n\n### **International reactions**\n\nThe international community welcomed the formation of the new government in Malaysia. The United States, China, and the European Union all congratulated Anwar Ibrahim on his appointment as Prime Minister.\n\n**See also**\n\n* List of members of the Dewan Rakyat, 2022-2027\n* List of members of the Dewan Negara, 2022-2027\n* Election Commission of Malaysia\n* Malaysian general election\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The results of the election are subject to review by the Election Commission of Malaysia.\n* The figures are based on the official results announced by the Election Commission of Malaysia.\n\n**References**\n\n* Election Commission of Malaysia.

The team's early years were marked by limited success, with the team failing to qualify for the FIFA World Cup until 1956. In the 1950s and 1960s, the team competed in several regional tournaments, including the Arab Nations Cup and the Pan Arab Games.\n\n## **1970s: Successes in Arab competitions**\n\nThe 1970s were a successful period for the Syrian national team, with the team winning several Arab competitions, including the Arab Nations Cup in 1972 and 1979. The team also competed in the 1972 Summer Olympics, where they were eliminated in the group stage.\n\n## **The years 1980-1996: an improvement in Syrian football**\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, the Syrian national team continued to improve, with the team qualifying for the FIFA World Cup in 1990 and competing in the AFC Asian Cup several times. The team's improved performance was due in part to the emergence of new talent, including players such as Faisal Khalil and Fadel Ebrahim.\n\n## **From 1996 to 2007: Years of hope and disappointment**\n\nThe late 1990s and early 2000s were a mixed period for the Syrian national team, with the team experiencing both successes and disappointments. In 2000, the team qualified for the AFC Asian Cup for the first time in 10 years, but was eliminated in the group stage. The team also competed in the 2000 AFC Asian Cup qualifiers, but failed to qualify for the tournament.\n\n## **From 2007 to 2012: Great achievements**\n\nThe 2007-2012 period was a successful period for the Syrian national team, with the team qualifying for the FIFA World Cup in 2010 and competing in the AFC Asian Cup several times. The team's improved performance was due in part to the emergence of new talent, including players such as Omar Al Somah and Firas Al Khatib.\n\n## **From 2013 to 2016: Withdrawal from positions**\n\nIn 2013, the Syrian national team withdrew from several international tournaments, including the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifiers and the 2015 AFC Asian Cup qualifiers. The team's withdrawal was due to the ongoing civil war in Syria, which had a significant impact on the team's performance.\n\n## **2018 World Cup qualifiers: Syria close to great success**\n\nIn the 2018 World Cup qualifiers, the Syrian national team came close to qualifying for the tournament, but ultimately failed to do so. The team's qualification campaign was marked by several impressive performances, including a 3-2 win over Australia in Sydney.\n\n### **Syria v Australia**\n\nThe match between Syria and Australia was played on October 8, 2017, at the ANZ Stadium in Sydney. The match was marked by several controversies, including the use of a video assistant referee (VAR) system, which was introduced for the first time in Asian football. The match ended in a 3-2 win for Australia, but Syria's performance was widely praised by fans and pundits alike.\n\n## **2019 Asian Cup: a missed opportunity**\n\nIn the 2019 AFC Asian Cup, the Syrian national team failed to progress beyond the group stage, despite being drawn in a relatively weak group. The team's performance was marked by several impressive individual performances, including those of Omar Al Somah and Firas Al Khatib.\n\n## **From 2019 to the present**\n\nIn 2019, the Syrian national team underwent a significant overhaul, with several new players joining the team and several veteran players leaving. The team's new coach, Theo Bucker, has expressed his commitment to developing the team and improving its performance.\n\n### **2023 AFC Asian Cup: Syria reach the knockout stage for the first time ever**\n\nIn the 2023 AFC Asian Cup, the Syrian national team reached the knockout stage for the first time in the team's history. The team's impressive performance was marked by several individual and collective efforts, including a 2-1 win over Uzbekistan in the round of 16.\n\n# **Stadiums**\n\nThe Syrian national team has played several matches at various stadiums around the world, including the Al Muhafazah Stadium in Aleppo, the Al-Assad Stadium in Damascus, and the ANZ Stadium in Sydney.\n\n# **Team image**\n\nThe Syrian national team's image is marked by several symbols, including the team's crest, which features the Syrian Arab Republic's national emblem and the team's name. The team's kit is also an important aspect of its image, with the team's current kit featuring a red and white design.\n\n## **Rivalries**\n\nThe Syrian national team has several rivalries with other teams in the region, including the Lebanese national team and the Jordanian national team.\n\n### **Syria vs. Lebanon**\n\nThe rivalry between Syria and Lebanon is one of the most intense in Middle Eastern football, with the two teams having a long and complex history. The two teams have played several matches against each other, including a 2015 AFC Asian Cup qualifier, which ended in a 1-1 draw.\n\n### **Syria vs. Jordan**\n\nThe rivalry between Syria and Jordan is also intense, with the two teams having a long history of competition.

The heatwaves were characterized by unusually high temperatures, with some areas reaching record highs. The heatwaves had significant impacts on various aspects of British society, including resorts, transportation, retail, and agriculture.\n\n**June heatwave**\n\nThe first heatwave of 2022 occurred in June, with temperatures soaring to levels not seen in over 40 years. The heatwave was particularly severe in the southern parts of England, where temperatures often reached 35°C (95°F) or higher. The heatwave was caused by a high-pressure system that dominated the weather pattern over the UK, leading to a prolonged period of hot and sunny weather.\n\n**Impact on resorts**\n\nThe June heatwave had a significant impact on British resorts, particularly those in the south of England. Many tourists flocked to the coast to escape the heat, leading to a surge in demand for accommodation and services. However, the heat also took its toll on the resorts, with some businesses reporting a shortage of staff and supplies. The heatwave also led to a increase in the number of heat-related illnesses, with some resorts reporting an increase in cases of heat exhaustion and heat stroke.\n\n**July heatwave**\n\nThe second heatwave of 2022 occurred in July, with temperatures again reaching record highs. The heatwave was particularly severe in the Midlands and the north of England, where temperatures often reached 38°C (100°F) or higher. The heatwave was caused by a low-pressure system that brought hot air from Europe into the UK, leading to a prolonged period of hot and humid weather.\n\n**Impact**\n\nThe July heatwave had a significant impact on various aspects of British society.\n\n### **Transport**\n\nThe heatwave had a major impact on transport in the UK, with many roads becoming congested as people attempted to escape the heat. The heat also led to a increase in the number of breakdowns, with many vehicles overheating or running out of fuel. The heatwave also led to a increase in the number of flights being delayed or cancelled, as airports struggled to cope with the demand.\n\n### **Retail**\n\nThe heatwave had a significant impact on retail in the UK, with many businesses reporting a surge in demand for cooling products such as fans and air conditioning units. However, the heat also led to a decrease in the number of shoppers, as people stayed indoors to avoid the heat. The heatwave also led to a increase in the number of sales of cooling drinks and snacks, as people attempted to stay hydrated and cool.\n\n### **Berry farming**\n\nThe heatwave had a significant impact on the UK's berry farming industry, with many farmers reporting a decrease in yields due to the extreme heat. The heat also led to a increase in the number of berry farms being abandoned, as farmers struggled to cope with the damage caused by the heat.\n\n### **Seaside resorts**\n\nThe heatwave had a significant impact on seaside resorts in the UK, with many businesses reporting a surge in demand for accommodation and services. However, the heat also led to a increase in the number of heat-related illnesses, with some resorts reporting an increase in cases of heat exhaustion and heat stroke.\n\n### **Utilities**\n\nThe heatwave had a significant impact on utilities in the UK, with many companies struggling to keep up with the demand for electricity and water. The heat also led to a increase in the number of power cuts, as the grid struggled to cope with the demand.\n\n### **Aftermath**\n\nThe heatwave had a significant impact on the UK, with many people struggling to cope with the aftermath. The heat led to a increase in the number of heat-related illnesses, with many people requiring medical attention. The heat also led to a increase in the number of claims for compensation, as people sought to recoup their losses.\n\n**August heatwave**\n\nThe third heatwave of 2022 occurred in August, with temperatures again reaching record highs. The heatwave was particularly severe in the south of England, where temperatures often reached 40°C (104°F) or higher. The heatwave was caused by a high-pressure system that dominated the weather pattern over the UK, leading to a prolonged period of hot and sunny weather.\n\n**Rain**\n\nThe heatwave was followed by a prolonged period of rain, with many areas receiving more than 100 mm (3.9 in) of rain in a single day. The rain was caused by a low-pressure system that brought moist air from the Atlantic into the UK, leading to a prolonged period of heavy rain.\n\n**Impact**\n\nThe rain had a significant impact on various aspects of British society.\n\n### **Retail**\n\nThe rain had a significant impact on retail in the UK, with many businesses reporting a surge in demand for waterproof products such as umbrellas and raincoats. However, the rain also led to a decrease in the number of shoppers, as people stayed indoors to avoid the rain.\n\n### **Gardening**\n\nThe rain had a significant impact on gardening in the UK, with many gardeners reporting a surge in demand for gardening products such as seeds and fertilizers. However, the rain also led to a decrease in the number of gardeners, as people stayed indoors to avoid the rain.\n\n**Drought**\n\nThe heatwaves had a significant impact on the UK's water supply, with many areas experiencing drought conditions. The drought was caused by a prolonged period of hot and dry weather, leading to a decrease in the amount of water available.\n\n**Wildfires**\n\nThe heatwaves led to a increase in the number of wildfires in the UK, with many areas experiencing large-scale fires. The wildfires were caused by the extreme heat and dry conditions, leading to a prolonged period of high fire danger.\n\n**Meteorology**\n\nThe heatwaves were caused by a combination of factors, including high pressure systems and warm air from Europe. The heatwaves were also influenced by climate change, with many scientists attributing the extreme heat to human activities.\n\n**Media coverage**\n\nThe heatwaves received extensive media coverage in the UK, with many newspapers and television stations reporting on the impact of the heat on various aspects of British society.\n\n**Analysis**\n\nThe heatwaves had a significant impact on the UK, with many people struggling to cope with the aftermath. The heat led to a increase in the number of heat-related illnesses, with many people requiring medical attention. The heat also led to a increase in the number of claims for compensation, as people sought to recoup their losses.\n\n**See also**\n\n* List of heatwaves in the United Kingdom\n* UK heatwave of 2019\n* UK heatwave of 2018", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.
