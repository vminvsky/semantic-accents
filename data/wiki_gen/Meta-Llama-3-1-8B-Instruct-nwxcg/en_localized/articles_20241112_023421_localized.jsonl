It has evolved over time, influenced by various cultural and literary movements. In this article, we will explore the development of fantasy from its early beginnings to the modern era.\n\n**Differences between fantasy and earlier fantastic works**\n\nWhile fantasy is often associated with magical creatures and supernatural events, it differs from earlier fantastic works in its focus on the imagination and the creation of alternative worlds. In contrast, ancient mythologies and folklores often aimed to explain natural phenomena and the workings of the universe. These stories were often rooted in a shared cultural or historical context, whereas fantasy seeks to create a new reality, often with its own rules and logic.\n\nOne of the key differences between fantasy and earlier fantastic works is the emphasis on storytelling. In ancient mythologies, stories were often used to convey moral lessons or explain the workings of the universe. In fantasy, the story itself is often the primary focus, with the aim of transporting the reader to a new and imaginative world.\n\n**Development of fantasy**\n\nFantasy as a distinct genre began to take shape in the Middle Ages, influenced by various cultural and literary movements.\n\n### **Romances**\n\nThe earliest forms of fantasy can be found in medieval romances, such as those written by Chrétien de Troyes and Sir Thomas Malory. These stories often featured magical creatures, enchanted forests, and heroic quests, which would become staples of the fantasy genre. The romances also introduced the concept of chivalry and the idealized knight, which would later influence the development of fantasy literature.\n\nMedieval romances also laid the groundwork for the concept of the hero's journey, a narrative pattern in which a hero embarks on a transformative quest. This pattern would be later popularized by Joseph Campbell and would become a central theme in fantasy literature.\n\n### **The Enlightenment**\n\nThe Enlightenment saw a shift towards rationalism and the scientific method, which had a profound impact on the development of fantasy. As the natural world was increasingly understood through scientific inquiry, the need for supernatural explanations decreased. This led to a decline in the popularity of fantasy and the rise of more realistic fiction.\n\nHowever, the Enlightenment also saw the emergence of new forms of fantasy, such as the Gothic novel. These stories often featured atmospheric settings, mysterious events, and a sense of foreboding, which would become hallmarks of the fantasy genre.\n\n### **Romanticism**\n\nRomanticism, which emerged in the late 18th century, saw a revival of interest in fantasy and the supernatural. Writers such as William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge drew on folkloric and mythological sources to create new forms of fantasy.\n\nRomanticism also emphasized the importance of imagination and the individual experience, which would become central themes in fantasy literature. The Romantic movement also saw the emergence of new forms of fantasy, such as the fairy tale and the supernatural novel.\n\n**Modern fantasy**\n\nModern fantasy, which began to take shape in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, saw a significant shift towards the creation of new worlds and the development of new mythologies.\n\n### **Pre-Tolkien**\n\nBefore the emergence of J.R.R. Tolkien, fantasy literature was dominated by fairy tales, supernatural novels, and adventure stories. Writers such as George MacDonald, William Morris, and Lord Dunsany created new and imaginative worlds, often drawing on mythological and folkloric sources.\n\nThese writers also laid the groundwork for the concept of the epic fantasy novel, a sprawling narrative that often spans multiple worlds and features complex characters and plotlines.\n\n### **Tolkien**\n\nJ.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings (1954-1955) marked a significant turning point in the development of modern fantasy. Tolkien's creation of Middle-earth, a fully realized and detailed world, raised the bar for fantasy writers and set a new standard for the genre.\n\nTolkien's influence can be seen in many areas of modern fantasy, including the use of mythology and folklore, the creation of new languages and cultures, and the emphasis on world-building.\n\n### **Post-Tolkien**\n\nAfter Tolkien, fantasy literature continued to evolve and diversify. Writers such as C.S. Lewis, Fritz Leiber, and Ursula K. Le Guin pushed the boundaries of the genre, experimenting with new forms and themes.\n\nThe 1960s and 1970s saw the emergence of the fantasy subgenre of science fantasy, which combined elements of science fiction and fantasy. Writers such as Robert A. Heinlein, Arthur C. Clarke, and Gene Wolfe explored the intersection of technology and magic.\n\n**References**\n\n* For further reading on the history of fantasy, see:\n\t+ \"The Oxford Handbook of Fantasy Literature\" edited by Farah Mendlesohn and Eve Sweetser\n\t+ \"The Cambridge Companion to Fantasy Literature\" edited by Edward James and Farah Mendlesohn\n\t+ \"The Encyclopedia of Fantasy\" edited by John Clute and John Grant", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The tournament is sanctioned by the World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC) and has been held every four years since its inception in 2006. The WBC is considered one of the premier international baseball competitions, attracting top talent from across the world and offering a unique platform for national teams to showcase their skills.\n\nBackground\n----------\n\nThe concept of an international baseball tournament dates back to the early 20th century, but it wasn't until the 1990s that the idea gained momentum. In 1998, Major League Baseball (MLB) and the International Baseball Federation (IBAF) partnered to create the World Baseball Classic, with the first tournament slated for 2006. The inaugural event was met with significant interest and success, paving the way for future editions.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n### 2006–09: Samurai Japan's back-to-back championships\n\nThe inaugural World Baseball Classic took place from March 3 to March 20, 2006, in the United States, Japan, and the Dominican Republic. Samurai Japan, representing Japan, won the first-ever WBC title, defeating Cuba 10-6 in the championship game. Japan repeated as champions in the 2009 tournament, defeating South Korea 5-3 in the title game.\n\nThe 2006 and 2009 championships marked the beginning of Japan's dominance in the WBC, with the team winning three of the first five tournaments. Samurai Japan's success can be attributed to a strong blend of experienced players and talented youngsters, as well as a well-structured team culture.\n\n### 2013: Direct qualification and \"Plátano Power\"\n\nThe 2013 World Baseball Classic took place from March 2 to March 19, 2013, in Japan, the United States, and the Dominican Republic.

The Dominican Republic won the tournament, defeating Puerto Rico 3-0 in the championship game. This marked the first WBC title for the Dominican Republic, who were coached by legendary manager Tony Peña.\n\nThe Dominican Republic's success was fueled by the \"Plátano Power\" offense, which featured a potent combination of power hitters and crafty pitchers. The team's dominant performance was a testament to the depth and talent of the Caribbean region.\n\n### 2017: American redemption\n\nThe 2017 World Baseball Classic took place from March 6 to March 22, 2017, in the United States, Japan, and the Dominican Republic. The United States won the tournament, defeating Puerto Rico 8-0 in the championship game. This marked the first WBC title for the United States, who were coached by manager Joe Torre.\n\nThe American team's victory was a redemption story, as they had struggled in the previous two tournaments.

The defending champion Samurai Japan will look to repeat as champions, while the United States and the Dominican Republic will aim to regain their titles.\n\nFormat\n-------\n\nThe World Baseball Classic features a round-robin format in the preliminary round, with teams divided into six groups of four teams each. The top two teams from each group advance to the second round, where they are seeded 1-8 based on their performance in the round-robin stage.

This practice is prevalent in various sports, with different rules and regulations governing the substitution process.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nFree substitution, also known as unlimited substitution, is a feature that is incorporated in many sports, allowing teams to change players during the game without any restrictions. This concept has been adopted in various forms across different sports, with the primary goal of promoting fair play, reducing injuries, and enhancing the overall game experience. In this article, we will explore the different types of sports that allow free substitution, as well as those that have limited or hybrid substitution systems.\n\n**Sports that allow free substitution during live play**\n\nSome sports allow unlimited substitution during live play, allowing teams to change players at any time. These sports often have a high level of physical contact and a fast-paced game tempo, making substitution a crucial aspect of the game.\n\n##American Football\n\nIn American football, teams are allowed to make unlimited substitutions during live play. This allows teams to rotate players in and out of the game to conserve energy, prevent injuries, and maintain a competitive edge. Substitutions can occur at any time, including during timeouts, between quarters, and between plays.\n\n##Rugby\n\nRugby is another sport that allows unlimited substitution during live play. In fact, teams are allowed to make seven substitutions at any time during the game, as long as they are not making a substitution to replace an injured player. This flexibility allows teams to adjust their game plan and maintain a high level of physical intensity throughout the game.\n\n##Lacrosse\n\nLacrosse is a fast-paced team sport that allows unlimited substitution during live play. Teams can make as many substitutions as they want, as long as the substitution is made within 60 seconds of the previous substitution. This allows teams to maintain a high level of energy and make strategic substitutions to gain a competitive advantage.\n\n**Sports that allow unlimited substitutions during stoppages of play only**\n\nSome sports allow unlimited substitutions during stoppages of play, but not during live play. These sports often have a slower game tempo and a lower level of physical contact, making substitution less frequent but still an important aspect of the game.\n\n##Basketball\n\nIn basketball, teams are allowed to make unlimited substitutions during stoppages of play, such as timeouts, halftime, and between quarters. However, substitutions are not allowed during live play, except in the case of an injury or a technical foul. This allows teams to maintain a high level of intensity and make strategic substitutions during the game.\n\n##Hockey\n\nHockey is another sport that allows unlimited substitutions during stoppages of play. Teams can make as many substitutions as they want during timeouts, between periods, and during intermissions. However, substitutions are not allowed during live play, except in the case of an injury or a penalty. This allows teams to maintain a high level of physical intensity and make strategic substitutions to gain a competitive advantage.\n\n**Sports with limited substitution**\n\nSome sports have limited substitution rules, which restrict the number of substitutions that can be made during the game. These sports often have a slower game tempo and a lower level of physical contact, making substitution less frequent but still an important aspect of the game.\n\n##Baseball\n\nIn baseball, teams are allowed to make unlimited substitutions between innings and during timeouts. However, substitutions are not allowed during live play, except in the case of an injury or a defensive replacement. This allows teams to maintain a high level of intensity and make strategic substitutions to gain a competitive advantage.\n\n##Soccer\n\nSoccer is a sport that has limited substitution rules. Teams are allowed to make three substitutions during the game, with a maximum of six substitutions per team. Substitutions can only be made during stoppages of play, such as halftime and between periods. This allows teams to maintain a high level of physical intensity and make strategic substitutions to gain a competitive advantage.\n\n**Sports with mixed or hybrid systems**\n\nSome sports have mixed or hybrid substitution systems, which combine elements of free substitution and limited substitution. These sports often have a unique game tempo and physical contact level, making substitution an important aspect of the game.\n\n##Water Polo\n\nWater polo is a sport that has a mixed substitution system. Teams are allowed to make unlimited substitutions during stoppages of play, but only a limited number of substitutions are allowed during live play. This allows teams to maintain a high level of physical intensity and make strategic substitutions to gain a competitive advantage.\n\n##Field Hockey\n\nField hockey is another sport that has a mixed substitution system. Teams are allowed to make unlimited substitutions during stoppages of play, but only a limited number of substitutions are allowed during live play. This allows teams to maintain a high level of physical intensity and make strategic substitutions to gain a competitive advantage.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Substitution (sports)\n* Injuries in sports\n* Game strategy\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The rules and regulations governing substitution in sports can vary depending on the specific league, competition, or governing body.\n* Substitution is an important aspect of many sports, and teams often develop strategic substitution plans to gain a competitive advantage.\n* The frequency and type of substitutions allowed can impact the game tempo, physical contact level, and overall game experience.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The strike, which began in July 2023, was the largest labor action in the entertainment industry since the 2007-2008 Writers Guild of America strike.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Unionization in Hollywood\n\nThe entertainment industry has a long history of unionization, dating back to the 1920s when the American Federation of Labor (AFL) established the Actors' Equity Association. The Screen Actors Guild (SAG) was founded in 1933, and in 2012, SAG and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA) merged to form SAG-AFTRA. The union represents over 160,000 members, including actors, stunt performers, dancers, and other entertainment industry professionals.\n\n### Pre-strike activity\n\nIn the months leading up to the strike, tensions between SAG-AFTRA and the major media conglomerates had been escalating. The union had been negotiating a new collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), which represents the major studios and networks. However, the talks broke down over issues such as residuals, streaming, and healthcare.\n\nOn June 30, 2023, SAG-AFTRA issued a statement announcing that it would be going on strike if a new CBA was not reached. The union's president, Gabrielle Carteris, stated that the strike would be the largest and most significant labor action in the entertainment industry's history.\n\n**Timeline**\n\n### July\n\nOn July 1, 2023, SAG-AFTRA members voted to authorize a strike, with 98% voting in favor. The union announced that it would be going on strike at 12:01 AM on July 4, 2023.\n\nOn July 3, 2023, the major media conglomerates issued a statement claiming that they were willing to negotiate a new CBA, but that the union's demands were unrealistic. The statement also threatened to lock out SAG-AFTRA members if the strike continued.\n\nOn July 4, 2023, SAG-AFTRA members went on strike, with pickets being set up outside major studios and networks.\n\n### August\n\nOn August 1, 2023, SAG-AFTRA and the AMPTP met for the first time since the strike began. However, the talks broke down over issues such as residuals and streaming.\n\nOn August 15, 2023, the major media conglomerates filed a lawsuit against SAG-AFTRA, claiming that the union's strike was illegal.\n\n### September\n\nOn September 1, 2023, SAG-AFTRA announced that it would be holding a rally in Los Angeles to show support for the strike. The rally drew thousands of protesters.\n\nOn September 15, 2023, the AMPTP offered a new proposal to SAG-AFTRA, which included increased residuals and improved healthcare benefits. However, the union rejected the offer, stating that it did not meet their demands.\n\n### October\n\nOn October 1, 2023, SAG-AFTRA announced that it would be extending the strike for another month.\n\nOn October 15, 2023, the major media conglomerates announced that they would be cutting back on production due to the strike.\n\n### November\n\nOn November 1, 2023, SAG-AFTRA and the AMPTP met for the first time in weeks. However, the talks broke down over issues such as residuals and streaming.\n\nOn November 15, 2023, the union announced that it would be holding a nationwide strike authorization vote.\n\n### December\n\nOn December 1, 2023, SAG-AFTRA members voted to extend the strike for another month.\n\nOn December 15, 2023, the union announced that it had reached a tentative agreement with the AMPTP. The agreement included increased residuals, improved healthcare benefits, and other concessions.\n\n**Strike activity and responses**\n\n### Locations\n\nThe strike affected major studios and networks across the United States, including Warner Bros., Universal, Paramount, and Disney. Pickets were set up outside major studios, including Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California, and Universal Studios in Universal City, California.\n\n### Media executives' response\n\nThe major media conglomerates responded to the strike by claiming that the union's demands were unrealistic and that the strike would harm the entertainment industry. They also threatened to lock out SAG-AFTRA members if the strike continued.\n\n### Politicians' response\n\nPoliticians from both parties responded to the strike, with some expressing support for the union and others criticizing the strike. California Governor Gavin Newsom issued a statement supporting the union, while Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) criticized the strike as \"illogical\" and \"selfish\".\n\n### Other unions' response\n\nOther unions in the entertainment industry, including the Writers Guild of America and the Directors Guild of America, expressed support for the SAG-AFTRA strike. The unions issued statements criticizing the major media conglomerates for their treatment of SAG-AFTRA members.\n\n### Other organizations' response\n\nOther organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the National Organization for Women (NOW), expressed support for the SAG-AFTRA strike. The organizations issued statements criticizing the major media conglomerates for their treatment of SAG-AFTRA members.\n\n### Impact\n\nThe strike had a significant impact on the entertainment industry, with many productions being delayed or canceled due to the lack of SAG-AFTRA actors and stunt performers. The strike also had an economic impact, with many SAG-AFTRA members losing income due to the strike.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nOn December 15, 2023, SAG-AFTRA announced that it had reached a tentative agreement with the AMPTP. The agreement included increased residuals, improved healthcare benefits, and other concessions. The union's members voted to ratify the agreement, ending the strike.\n\nThe agreement marked a significant victory for the union, with many of its demands being met. However, the agreement also marked a significant defeat for the major media conglomerates, who were forced to make concessions in order to end the strike.\n\n**See also**\n\n* List of strikes in the United States\n* Labor law in the United States\n* Collective bargaining in the United States\n* Entertainment industry in the United States\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is based on publicly available information and may not reflect the views of the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists or the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers.\n* The article is intended to provide a neutral and informative account of the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike and its impact on the entertainment industry.\n\n**References**\n\n* (No references are cited in this article)\n\n**External links**\n\n* SAG-AFTRA official website\n* Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers official website\n* Entertainment Industry Foundation official website", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

He is best known for his influential reporting on the My Lai Massacre during the Vietnam War and his subsequent investigative work on government secrecy, corruption, and international conflict. Hersh's investigative reporting has been widely recognized for its depth, accuracy, and impact.\n\n# Early life and education\nSeymour Hersh was born on April 8, 1937, in Chicago, Illinois, to a Jewish family. His father, Jacob Hersh, was a factory worker, and his mother, Dorothy (née Klinger), was a homemaker. Hersh grew up in a working-class neighborhood on the city's South Side and developed an early interest in writing and journalism.\n\nHersh attended South Shore High School in Chicago, where he began writing for the school newspaper. After graduating in 1954, he attended the University of Chicago, where he studied English and history. During his time at the university, Hersh began to develop his writing skills and became involved in student activism. He graduated in 1958 with a Bachelor of Arts degree.\n\n# Newspaper career\n\nAfter college, Hersh moved to Washington, D.C., where he landed a job as a reporter for the Washington Sunday Star. In 1962, he joined the Associated Press, where he covered the White House and the government. Hersh's early reporting focused on the civil rights movement and the emerging role of the federal government in addressing racial inequality.\n\n## My Lai massacre\n\nIn 1969, Hersh was assigned to cover the Vietnam War. While embedded with the U.S. Army, he heard rumors of a massacre at the village of My Lai. Investigating further, Hersh traveled to the nearby town of Quang Ngai Province, where he spoke with local villagers and gathered testimony from soldiers who had participated in the massacre. On November 12, 1969, Hersh published his exclusive report, \"My Lai 4: A Report on the Massacre and Its Aftermath,\" in The New York Times Magazine.\n\nHersh's reporting on the My Lai massacre led to widespread outrage and calls for accountability. The subsequent investigation and court-martial proceedings resulted in the conviction of Lieutenant William Calley and the exoneration of many other soldiers who had participated in the massacre.\n\n## The New York Times\n\nIn 1970, Hersh joined The New York Times as a national correspondent, where he continued to report on government secrecy and corruption. His investigative reporting during this period focused on the Nixon administration's abuses of power, including the use of domestic spying and the cover-up of the My Lai massacre.\n\n# Investigative books: 1980s and 1990s\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, Hersh turned his attention to writing investigative books. His first book, \"My Lai 4\" (1970), was a detailed account of the massacre and its aftermath. In 1983, he published \"The Price of Power: Kissinger in the Nixon White House,\" which exposed the inner workings of the Nixon administration and the role of Henry Kissinger in shaping U.S. foreign policy.\n\nIn 1991, Hersh published \"The Samson Option: Israel's Nuclear Arsenal and American Foreign Policy,\" which explored the development of Israel's nuclear program and its implications for U.S. foreign policy. This book won the National Book Critics Circle Award for General Nonfiction.\n\n# Later investigations\n\nIn the 2000s and 2010s, Hersh continued to investigate government secrecy and corruption. Some of his notable investigations include:\n\n## Iraq and Abu Ghraib\n\nIn 2004, Hersh published an investigative report on the Abu Ghraib prison scandal in Iraq, which revealed widespread human rights abuses committed by U.S. soldiers. His report, \"Chain of Command,\" exposed the involvement of senior military officials in the abuse and the cover-up of the scandal.\n\n## Iran\n\nIn 2008, Hersh published an investigative report on the U.S. intelligence community's assessment of Iran's nuclear program, which revealed that the CIA had been exaggerating the threat posed by Iran's nuclear capabilities.\n\n## Syria and chemical attacks\n\nIn 2013, Hersh published an investigative report on the alleged use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government, which challenged the Obama administration's claim that the attack was carried out by the Assad regime. His report, \"The Red Line and the Rat Line,\" revealed that the CIA had been secretly training and arming Syrian rebels, including those affiliated with al-Qaeda.\n\n## Killing of Osama bin Laden\n\nIn 2015, Hersh published a book, \"The Killing of Osama bin Laden,\" which challenged the official account of the operation and revealed that the Navy SEALs who carried out the raid had been motivated by a desire for revenge rather than a desire to capture or kill bin Laden.\n\n## Nord Stream pipeline and Ukraine\n\nIn 2020, Hersh published an investigative report on the Nord Stream pipeline project, which revealed that the CIA had been secretly working with Ukrainian officials to sabotage the pipeline and undermine Russia's energy interests.\n\n# Other statements\n\nHersh has made several notable statements and given speeches on various topics, including:\n\n## Speeches\n\nIn 2014, Hersh delivered a speech at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., in which he criticized the Obama administration's handling of the Ukraine crisis and the rise of neoliberalism in the United States. In 2016, he delivered a speech at the University of Chicago, in which he discussed the implications of the Panama Papers revelations on global financial systems.\n\n## Murder of Seth Rich\n\nIn 2017, Hersh was interviewed by a conspiracy theorist who suggested that Seth Rich, a Democratic National Committee staffer who was murdered in 2016, had been involved in a plot to leak DNC emails to WikiLeaks. Hersh denied the theory and stated that he had no evidence to support it.\n\n## Pat Nixon abuse\n\nIn 2019, Hersh published an investigative report on the alleged abuse of Pat Nixon, the wife of President Richard Nixon, which revealed that Nixon had used his presidential power to intimidate and silence Pat Nixon.\n\n# Use of anonymous sources\n\nHersh has been criticized for using anonymous sources in his reporting. In 2014, he was criticized by the Washington Post for using unnamed sources to report on the Obama administration's handling of the Ukraine crisis. Hersh has defended his use of anonymous sources, arguing that they are necessary to protect sources who may be in danger of retaliation or persecution.\n\n# Personal life\n\nHersh has been married twice and has two children. He lives in Washington, D.C., and is a member of the National Press Club.\n\n# Awards and honors\n\nHersh has won numerous awards for his reporting, including the Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting in 1970 for his reporting on the My Lai massacre. He has also won the George Polk Award for Investigative Reporting and the National Book Critics Circle Award for General Nonfiction.\n\n# Publications\n\nHersh has published several books, including:\n\n## Books\n\n* \"My Lai 4\" (1970)\n* \"The Price of Power: Kissinger in the Nixon White House\" (1983)\n* \"The Samson Option: Israel's Nuclear Arsenal and American Foreign Policy\" (1991)\n* \"Chain of Command: The Road from 9/11 to Abu Ghraib\" (2004)\n* \"The Dark Side: The Inside Story of How the War on Terror Turned into a War on American Ideals\" (2009)\n* \"The Killing of Osama bin Laden\" (2015)\n* \"The Reporter's Handbook: A Guide to Investigative Reporting\" (2019)\n\n## Articles\n\nHersh has published numerous articles in various publications, including The New Yorker, The New York Times, and The Washington Post.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

He is best known for his alleged crimes, including child murder and occult involvement, which led to his execution in 1440. This article will explore de Rais' life, military career, and eventual downfall, as well as the question of his guilt and the various interpretations of his story over time.\n\nHouse of Retz\n\nDe Rais was born into the powerful House of Retz, a noble family in the kingdom of France. His father, Guy de Rais, was a skilled military leader and a close ally of the French monarch, Charles VI. The family's wealth and influence were substantial, with extensive lands and titles in the provinces of Anjou and Maine.\n\nEarly life\n\nGilles de Rais was born on October 14, 1404, in Champtocé, a small town in the province of Anjou. He was the eldest son of Guy and his wife, Marie de Craon. De Rais' early life was marked by a privileged upbringing, with access to the best education and training available. He was educated in literature, philosophy, and the arts, as well as the traditional skills of a nobleman, such as horsemanship and sword fighting.\n\nMatrimonial projects\n\nIn 1420, de Rais was married to Catherine de Thouars, a member of the powerful House of Thouars. However, the marriage was short-lived, as Catherine died in childbirth in 1420. De Rais' subsequent attempts to marry again were thwarted by his family's opposition, as well as his own desire for a more suitable match.\n\nFamily disputes\n\nDe Rais' family was plagued by disputes and power struggles, particularly between his father and his uncle, Charles de Rais. The two men were rivals for control of the family's wealth and influence, with the uncle eventually emerging victorious. De Rais' own relationships with his family members were strained, particularly with his mother, who was known for her strict and unforgiving nature.\n\nTitles, estates and wealth\n\nAs a member of the House of Retz, de Rais held a range of titles and estates, including the lordship of Champtocé and the county of Retz. He also inherited a substantial fortune, which included lands, castles, and other assets. However, de Rais' management of his wealth was often reckless and irresponsible, leading to significant financial difficulties.\n\nMilitary career\n\nDe Rais' military career began in the early 1420s, when he served as a knight in the army of Charles VI. He quickly distinguished himself as a skilled and courageous warrior, earning the admiration of his comrades and the respect of his superiors.\n\nFirst hypothetical feat of arms\n\nOne of de Rais' earliest military exploits was his alleged participation in the Battle of the Verne, a fictional battle that took place in 1420. According to legend, de Rais led a small group of men to victory against a much larger enemy force, using his cunning and bravery to outmaneuver his opponents.\n\nFranco-Breton alliance through the House of Valois-Anjou\n\nIn 1424, de Rais became a close ally of the French monarch, Charles VII, who was seeking to form an alliance with the Breton nobles. De Rais played a key role in negotiating this alliance, which ultimately led to the signing of the Treaty of Verneuil.\n\nGuerilla warfare against English garrisons on the borders of Maine\n\nDe Rais' military career continued to flourish in the 1430s, as he led a series of successful raids against English garrisons on the borders of Maine. These guerrilla attacks were designed to weaken the English presence in the region and to secure French control over key territories.\n\nCompanion in arms with Joan of Arc\n\nOne of the most famous episodes in de Rais' military career was his association with Joan of Arc, the young French heroine who led the armies of Charles VII to several key victories. De Rais was a close companion and ally of Joan, who valued his bravery and military skills.\n\nCivil wars between La Trémoille and Richemont's allies\n\nHowever, de Rais' relationship with Joan of Arc was also marked by tension and conflict, particularly with her rival, Georges de La Trémoille. This conflict ultimately led to the downfall of de Rais, as he became embroiled in the power struggles between the two factions.\n\nLifting of the siege of Lagny\n\nIn 1437, de Rais played a key role in lifting the siege of Lagny, a town in the province of Champagne that was under attack by a large English army. De Rais led a small group of men to victory against the English, using his cunning and bravery to outmaneuver his opponents.\n\nReduction of military commitments\n\nHowever, de Rais' military career was ultimately marked by a reduction of his commitments, as he became increasingly embroiled in the power struggles between the rival factions.\n\nSquandering of heritage\n\nDe Rais' management of his wealth and influence was often reckless and irresponsible, leading to significant financial difficulties. He spent lavishly on his castles and estates, as well as on the arts and entertainment.\n\nCriminal life\n\nDe Rais' reputation was also marked by allegations of criminal activity, including child murder and occult involvement.\n\nOccult involvement\n\nDe Rais was accused of practicing witchcraft and sorcery, and of using his powers to manipulate and control others. These allegations were likely exaggerated or fabricated, but they reflect the dark and complex nature of de Rais' personality.\n\nChild murders\n\nHowever, de Rais was also accused of child murder, with allegations that he had killed dozens of young boys in a series of horrific and ritualistic killings. These allegations are supported by some contemporary accounts, but they remain a subject of controversy and debate.\n\nAct of force in Saint-Étienne-de-Mer-Morte\n\nIn 1432, de Rais was involved in a brutal and bloody act of violence in the town of Saint-Étienne-de-Mer-Morte, where he and his men slaughtered a group of villagers who were suspected of being heretics.\n\nEcclesiastical and secular investigations\n\nDe Rais' alleged crimes eventually came to the attention of the ecclesiastical and secular authorities, who launched a series of investigations into his activities. These investigations led to his arrest and eventual execution in 1440.\n\nTrial and execution\n\nDe Rais was put on trial in 1440, charged with a range of crimes including heresy, sorcery, and child murder. The trial was marked by a series of dramatic and sensational events, including de Rais' own confession and his subsequent recantation.\n\nQuestion of guilt\n\nThe question of de Rais' guilt remains a subject of controversy and debate, with some historians arguing that he was a serial killer and others that he was a victim of circumstance and persecution.\n\nDoubts about the verdict in the Age of Enlightenment tradition\n\nIn the Age of Enlightenment, de Rais' case was often cited as an example of the dangers of witch-hunting and the importance of separating fact from fiction. Many historians argued that de Rais was innocent and that his conviction was a miscarriage of justice.\n\nOccultist interpretations\n\nHowever, de Rais' case has also been interpreted in terms of occultism and the supernatural, with some historians arguing that he was a genuine practitioner of magic and sorcery.\n\nGeorges Bataille's interpretations\n\nThe French philosopher Georges Bataille was deeply fascinated by de Rais' case and wrote extensively on the subject. Bataille argued that de Rais was a symbol of the darker aspects of human nature and that his case represented a profound challenge to traditional notions of morality and justice.\n\n1992 mock re-trial\n\nIn 1992, a mock re-trial was held in France to re-examine de Rais' case and to consider the evidence against him. However, the re-trial ultimately failed to shed new light on the case and the question of de Rais' guilt remains a subject of ongoing debate and controversy.\n\nContemporary academic views\n\nToday, de Rais' case is seen as a complex and multifaceted example of the darker aspects of human nature, including the dangers of cultism, the importance of separating fact from fiction, and the need for a nuanced and balanced approach to understanding the past.\n\nFictional portraits\n\nDe Rais has been the subject of numerous fictional portraits and interpretations, including plays, films, and novels. These portrayals often reflect the darker and more sensational aspects of his case, including his alleged crimes and his supposed connections to the occult.\n\nPsychopathological interpretations\n\nDe Rais' case has also been interpreted in terms of psychopathology, with some historians arguing that he suffered from a range of mental health disorders including narcissistic personality disorder and antisocial personality disorder.\n\nFin de siècle portrayals\n\nIn the fin de siècle period, de Rais was often portrayed as a symbol of decadence and corruption, with his case seen as a reflection of the darker aspects of human nature.\n\nClassification as a serial killer\n\nToday, de Rais is often classified as a serial killer, with his case seen as a classic example of the darker aspects of human nature.\n\nGilles de Rais and the Bluebeard myth\n\nDe Rais' case has also been linked to the Bluebeard myth, with some historians arguing that his alleged crimes were inspired by this famous fairy tale.\n\nRelationship with Joan of Arc\n\nDe Rais' relationship with Joan of Arc remains a subject of ongoing debate and controversy, with some historians arguing that he was a close friend and ally, while others see him as a rival and a threat.\n\nSee also\n\n* List of serial killers by country: France\n* List of French serial killers\n* Category:Serial killers by occupation: Nobility\n* Category:Serial killers by occupation: Knights\n* Category:Serial killers by occupation: Military personnel\n\nReferences\n\nNotes\n\n1. ↑  \"Gilles de Rais\".

This period, spanning from the 14th to the 16th century, witnessed the emergence of renowned sculptors who pushed the boundaries of art and craftsmanship. Italian Renaissance sculpture encompasses a wide range of materials, settings, and styles, reflecting the cultural and artistic developments of the time.\n\n**Periods**\n\nItalian Renaissance sculpture can be broadly divided into several periods, each characterized by distinct styles and approaches.\n\n### **To 1400**\n\nDuring the early 14th century, Italian sculpture was heavily influenced by the Byzantine style, which emphasized gold leaf, mosaics, and ornate decoration. This period saw the creation of iconic works such as the bronze doors of the Pisa Cathedral and the marble sculptures of Arnolfo di Cambio.\n\n### **From 1400**\n\nThe period between 1400 and 1499 saw the emergence of a new style, characterized by a focus on classical forms and techniques.

Sculptors such as Donatello and Verrocchio pioneered this new style, experimenting with innovative materials and techniques.\n\n### **Doors of the Florence Baptistery**\n\nOne of the most iconic examples of this period is the bronze doors of the Florence Baptistery, designed by Andrea Pisano. Completed in 1329, these doors feature intricate reliefs depicting scenes from the New Testament.

This exchange of ideas and techniques helped to shape the art of other countries and contributed to the development of a global style.\n\n**Settings**\n\nItalian Renaissance sculpture was created in a variety of settings, reflecting the cultural and artistic developments of the time.\n\n### **Churches and tombs**\n\nMany of the most iconic works of Italian Renaissance sculpture were created for churches and tombs.

The history of Christianity spans over two millennia, beginning with the life and teachings of Jesus Christ in the 1st century AD and continuing to the present day. This article provides an overview of the major events, developments, and themes in the history of Christianity.\n\n**#Early Christianity**\n\n###**##Jewish background**\n\nChristianity emerged from Judaism, a monotheistic religion that believes in the one God of the Hebrew Bible. The Jewish people had been expecting a messiah, a savior who would liberate them from Roman oppression and establish a new era of peace and prosperity. Jesus Christ, who was born in Bethlehem, was seen as the fulfillment of these expectations. However, Jesus' teachings and actions were not in line with the traditional Jewish understanding of the messiah, and this led to a division between the early Christian communities and the Jewish authorities.\n\n###**##Apostolic Age (c. 30–100)**\n\nThe Apostolic Age was a period of rapid growth and development for the Christian communities. During this time, the apostles, including Peter, Paul, and James, played a crucial role in spreading Christianity throughout the Mediterranean world. The early Christian communities were characterized by a strong emphasis on the teachings of Jesus and the experience of the Holy Spirit.\n\n####**###Developing church structure**\n\nAs the Christian communities grew, a more formal structure began to emerge. The apostles appointed leaders, known as bishops, to oversee the local churches. The bishops were assisted by other clergy, including priests and deacons. This structure would eventually become the basis for the hierarchical organization of the Christian church.\n\n####**###Early growth**\n\nThe early Christian communities faced significant challenges, including persecution from the Roman authorities and competition from other forms of spirituality. Despite these challenges, Christianity continued to grow, and by the end of the 1st century AD, it had become a significant presence in the Mediterranean world.\n\n###**##Ante-Nicene period (100–312)**\n\nThe Ante-Nicene period was a time of significant theological development and controversy within the Christian communities. During this time, the early Christian writers, including Irenaeus and Tertullian, struggled to articulate a coherent theology in response to the challenges of Gnosticism and other forms of heresy.\n\n####**###Scripture**\n\nThe Ante-Nicene period saw the emergence of the Christian scriptures, including the Old Testament and the New Testament. The early Christian writers saw the scriptures as a source of authority and guidance for the Christian communities.\n\n####**###Early Christian art**\n\nEarly Christian art was characterized by its simplicity and lack of ornamentation. The early Christian artists focused on depicting the key events of the Christian story, including the life and teachings of Jesus Christ.\n\n####**###Persecutions and legalization**\n\nThe Ante-Nicene period saw a series of persecutions against the Christian communities, including the reign of Emperor Diocletian. However, in 313 AD, Emperor Constantine issued the Edict of Milan, which granted tolerance to the Christians and marked the beginning of a new era of Christianization.\n\n###**##Spread of Christianity to c. 300 AD**\n\nDuring the 3rd century AD, Christianity spread rapidly throughout the Mediterranean world. The Christian communities faced significant challenges, including persecution and competition from other forms of spirituality. However, they also experienced significant growth and development, including the emergence of a formal church structure and the development of a coherent theology.\n\n####**###Inclusivity, women and exclusivity**\n\nThe early Christian communities were characterized by a strong emphasis on inclusivity and equality. Women played a significant role in the early Christian communities, and the apostle Paul emphasized the importance of equality and mutual respect.\n\n####**###Moral practices**\n\nThe early Christian communities emphasized the importance of moral practices, including charity, forgiveness, and compassion. The early Christian writers saw these practices as essential for living a virtuous life and for building a just and compassionate society.\n\n**#Late antiquity (313–476)**\n\nLate antiquity was a time of significant change and development within the Christian communities. During this time, the church continued to grow and mature, and it began to take on a more formal structure.\n\n###**##Conversion of Constantine**\n\nThe conversion of Emperor Constantine in 312 AD marked a significant turning point in the history of Christianity. Constantine saw Christianity as a unifying force that could bring together the various factions of the Roman Empire. He issued the Edict of Milan, which granted tolerance to the Christians, and he encouraged the Christian communities to build their churches and to develop their institutions.\n\n####**###Christianity and the state**\n\nThe conversion of Constantine marked the beginning of a new era of Christianization. The church began to take on a more formal structure, and it began to play a more significant role in the life of the Roman Empire. The Christian leaders, including the bishops and the clergy, began to work closely with the imperial authorities to promote the interests of the church.\n\n####**###Christianity and polytheism**\n\nLate antiquity saw a significant decline in the practice of polytheism.

The imperial authorities, including Emperor Constantine, encouraged the Christians to build their churches and to promote their monotheistic beliefs.\n\n###**##Augustine's ethic toward Jews**\n\nThe theologian Augustine of Hippo (354–430 AD) played a significant role in shaping the Christian ethic toward Jews. Augustine believed that the Jews had rejected Jesus Christ, and that they were therefore guilty of deicide. He emphasized the importance of conversion and the need for Jews to accept Jesus Christ as their savior.\n\n###**##Developing orthodoxy and heresy**\n\nLate antiquity saw the emergence of a formal orthodoxy within the Christian communities.

The film stars Vijay in the lead role, alongside an ensemble cast including Malavika Mohanan, Shiva Anand, and Ramya Nambeeshan.\n\n#Plot\n\nThe film follows the story of a prison warden named Dhananjayan (Vijay), who is known for his strict and fair approach towards the inmates. However, his life takes a drastic turn when he is transferred to a new prison, where he encounters a notorious gangster named Chandru (M. Sasikumar). As Dhananjayan delves deeper into the prison's inner workings, he discovers a web of corruption and deceit, which puts him at odds with the authorities.\n\nDespite the challenges he faces, Dhananjayan remains committed to his duty and works tirelessly to reform the inmates and bring about positive change in the prison system. Along the way, he forges an unlikely friendship with Chandru, who is struggling to come to terms with his past mistakes.\n\nAs the story unfolds, Dhananjayan and Chandru find themselves entangled in a complex battle against the corrupt system, with the fate of the prison and its inmates hanging in the balance.\n\n#Cast\n\n* Vijay as Dhananjayan\n* Malavika Mohanan as Priya\n* Shiva Anand as Vikram\n* Ramya Nambeeshan as Divya\n* M. Sasikumar as Chandru\n* Vinayakan as Dhanraj\n* Rajendran as Sathyamoorthy\n* Varun as Jegan\n\n#Production\n\n##Development\n\nThe idea for Jailer was first conceived by Mohan Raja, who wanted to explore the theme of social justice and reform through a prison drama. Raja worked closely with Vijay to develop the story and characters, drawing inspiration from real-life events and experiences.\n\n##Pre-production\n\nPre-production for Jailer began in early 2020, with Raja and his team conducting extensive research on the Indian prison system and its complexities. The script was finalized in June 2020, and casting began shortly thereafter.\n\n##Casting\n\nVijay was the first actor to be cast in the film, with Raja approaching him with the idea of playing the lead role of Dhananjayan. Malavika Mohanan and Shiva Anand were cast in supporting roles, while M. Sasikumar was brought on board to play the role of Chandru.\n\n##Filming\n\nPrincipal photography for Jailer began in October 2020 and wrapped up in March 2021. The film was shot on a combination of digital and 35mm film, with a team of over 200 crew members working on the production.\n\n##Post-production\n\nPost-production for Jailer began in April 2021, with Raja and his team working closely on editing, sound design, and visual effects. The film's score was composed by Gurukiran, who drew inspiration from traditional Tamil music and instrumentation.\n\n#Music\n\nThe music for Jailer was composed by Gurukiran, who worked closely with Raja and Vijay to create a soundtrack that reflected the film's themes and tone. The soundtrack features six original songs, including the hit single \"Yaar Yaar\" which gained massive popularity among the audiences.\n\n#Marketing\n\nMarketing for Jailer began in June 2022, with the release of the film's first trailer and promotional posters. The film's social media campaign was launched in July 2022, with Vijay and the cast sharing behind-the-scenes content and teasers.\n\n#Release\n\n##Theatrical\n\nJailer was released on July 28, 2023, in over 300 theaters across Tamil Nadu and other parts of India. The film received a wide release, with many theaters opening up special preview shows and midnight screenings.\n\n##Screenings and statistics\n\nAccording to reports, Jailer grossed over ₹100 million (US$1.3 million) on its opening day, making it one of the highest-grossing films of the year. The film's opening weekend collections stood at ₹250 million (US$3.2 million), with many theaters selling out shows for the next few weeks.\n\n##Distribution\n\nJailer was distributed by Kalanidhi Maran's Sun Pictures, who worked closely with Raja and Vijay to ensure a smooth distribution process. The film was released in Tamil, with subtitles and dubbing in other languages to follow.\n\n##Home media\n\nJailer was released on digital platforms in September 2023, with the film available for streaming on Amazon Prime Video and other popular platforms.\n\n##Controversies\n\nJailer sparked controversy in August 2023, when the film's trailer was criticized for depicting a scene that was perceived as insensitive towards the LGBTQ+ community. Raja and Vijay issued an apology, stating that the scene was not intended to cause offense and would be reworked in the final cut.\n\n#Reception\n\n##Critical response\n\nJailer received mixed reviews from critics, with some praising the film's performances and social commentary, while others found the storytelling and pacing to be uneven. The film holds a 60% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 5.5/10.\n\n##Box office\n\nJailer was a commercial success, grossing over ₹500 million (US$6.5 million) at the domestic box office and ₹1.5 billion (US$19 million) worldwide. The film's success can be attributed to Vijay's massive fanbase and the film's timely release, which coincided with the festive season.\n\n#Sequel\n\nA sequel to Jailer is reportedly in the works, with Raja and Vijay set to reprise their roles. However, no official announcement has been made, and the project is still in development.\n\n#Documentary series\n\nA documentary series based on Jailer is also in production, with Raja and Vijay set to executive produce. The series will explore the themes of social justice and reform through a deeper dive into the world of Indian prisons.\n\n#Notes\n\nJailer marks Mohan Raja's fifth directorial venture, following successful films like Thuppakki, Vedalam, and Sarkar. The film's success can be attributed to the combined efforts of Raja, Vijay, and the entire cast and crew.\n\n#References\n\nThis article uses material from Wikipedia.org.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

First published between 1975 and 1981, the novel is a three-volume work that explores the intersection of art, politics, and ideology. This article provides an overview of the novel's plot, form features, and history of origins and publication, as well as its textual forms, artists and artworks referenced in the novel, and its reception in Germany and worldwide.\n\n**Plot**\nThe Aesthetics of Resistance is a sprawling, experimental novel that defies easy summarization. At its core, the novel is a philosophical and political exploration of the relationship between art and resistance. The story is set in the 1960s and follows the lives of three friends – Coco, Anna, and Castoriadis – as they navigate the complexities of revolutionary politics and artistic expression.\n\nThroughout the novel, Weiss interweaves historical and mythological references, often blurring the lines between reality and fiction. The novel's structure is non-linear, with events unfolding in a series of fragmented and disjointed scenes. This reflects the chaotic and disorienting nature of revolutionary politics, where clear narratives and certainties are often impossible to find.\n\n**Form features and structure**\nThe Aesthetics of Resistance is a work of avant-garde literature, characterized by its innovative use of form and structure. Weiss employs a range of techniques, including collage, montage, and free association, to create a sense of disjointedness and disorder. This reflects the novel's themes of resistance and rebellion, where traditional forms of narrative and expression are often subverted or challenged.\n\nOne of the novel's most striking features is its use of multiple narrative voices. Weiss employs a range of voices, from first-person accounts to third-person narration, often blurring the lines between different characters and perspectives. This creates a sense of fragmentation and dislocation, reflecting the complex and often contradictory nature of revolutionary politics.\n\n**History of origins and publication**\nThe Aesthetics of Resistance was written between 1967 and 1975, a period of great turmoil and upheaval in world politics. Weiss was heavily influenced by the events of May 1968 in France, which saw widespread student protests and strikes against the government. This event marked a turning point in Weiss's life and work, as he became increasingly involved in left-wing politics and began to see the need for a new form of revolutionary art.\n\n**Beginning**\nWeiss's initial idea for the novel was to write a work of revolutionary theatre, something that would capture the spirit of rebellion and resistance that was sweeping through Europe. However, as he began to write, he realized that a novel was the better form for his work. The Aesthetics of Resistance was thus born, a sprawling and experimental work that would take five years to complete.\n\n**Research**\nWeiss was a meticulous researcher, pouring over a wide range of sources, from Marxist theory to avant-garde art. He was particularly interested in the work of the Situationists, a group of revolutionary artists and writers who sought to challenge traditional forms of art and culture. Weiss saw the Situationists as a key influence on his own work, and he often incorporated their ideas and techniques into his novel.\n\n**Writers block**\nWeiss struggled with writer's block throughout the writing of the novel, often feeling overwhelmed by the complexity and scope of his work. At one point, he abandoned the project altogether, feeling that it was impossible to complete. However, he eventually returned to the novel, pouring all his energy into its completion.\n\n**The third volume**\nThe third volume of the novel was the most challenging to write, as Weiss struggled to bring together the disparate threads of the story. He was concerned that the novel would be too long, too complex, and too confusing for readers. However, he eventually completed the work, despite his doubts and fears.\n\n**Sweden and the GDR**\nThe Aesthetics of Resistance was first published in Sweden in 1975, under the title \"Estetiken av Motståndet\". The novel was a huge success, with reviewers praising its innovative form and its commitment to revolutionary politics. In 1977, the novel was published in East Germany, where it became a cult classic among left-wing intellectuals.\n\n**Other translations**\nThe novel has since been translated into numerous languages, including English, French, Spanish, and Italian. It has been widely praised for its innovative form and its commitment to revolutionary politics.\n\n**Textual forms**\nThe Aesthetics of Resistance is a work of experimental literature, characterized by its innovative use of form and structure. Weiss employs a range of techniques, including collage, montage, and free association, to create a sense of disjointedness and disorder. This reflects the novel's themes of resistance and rebellion, where traditional forms of narrative and expression are often subverted or challenged.\n\nOne of the novel's most striking features is its use of multiple narrative voices. Weiss employs a range of voices, from first-person accounts to third-person narration, often blurring the lines between different characters and perspectives. This creates a sense of fragmentation and dislocation, reflecting the complex and often contradictory nature of revolutionary politics.\n\n**Artists and artworks in the novel**\nThe Aesthetics of Resistance is a work of art that is deeply concerned with the relationship between art and politics. Weiss draws on a wide range of artistic and cultural references, from the works of Michelangelo to the avant-garde art of the 1960s. Some of the key artists and artworks referenced in the novel include:\n\n* **Divine Comedy**: Weiss draws on the Divine Comedy as a model for his novel's use of multiple narrative voices and its exploration of the relationship between art and morality.\n* **Central artworks**: Weiss references a range of central artworks, from the Mona Lisa to the Statue of Liberty, in order to explore the relationship between art and politics.\n* **Questions**: Weiss uses the novel to raise a range of questions about the relationship between art and politics, including the role of the artist in society and the nature of revolutionary politics.\n\n**Reception**\nThe Aesthetics of Resistance was widely praised by reviewers when it was first published, with many praising its innovative form and its commitment to revolutionary politics. However, the novel has also been subject to criticism, with some reviewers finding it overly complex and challenging.\n\n**Mixed reactions in culture**\nThe novel has been subject to mixed reactions in culture, with some seeing it as a key work of revolutionary literature and others viewing it as overly experimental and difficult. In Germany, the novel was widely praised by left-wing intellectuals, but it was also criticized by some for its perceived lack of clarity and coherence.\n\n**Germany**\nIn Germany, the novel was widely praised by left-wing intellectuals, who saw it as a key work of revolutionary literature. However, it was also criticized by some for its perceived lack of clarity and coherence.\n\n**Worldwide**\nThe novel has since been translated into numerous languages and has been widely praised for its innovative form and its commitment to revolutionary politics. However, it has also been subject to criticism, with some reviewers finding it overly complex and challenging.\n\n**Reading groups**\nThe Aesthetics of Resistance has been the subject of numerous reading groups and discussions, with many readers finding it a challenging but rewarding work of literature. Some of the key themes discussed in reading groups include the relationship between art and politics, the nature of revolutionary politics, and the role of the artist in society.\n\n**Intermedial Reception**\nThe novel has been subject to intermedial reception, with some readers interpreting it as a work of film or theatre. This reflects the novel's use of multiple narrative voices and its exploration of the relationship between art and politics.\n\n**Radio play**\nThe Aesthetics of Resistance was adapted into a radio play in 1977, with the Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra performing the work. The radio play was a huge success, with listeners praising its innovative form and its commitment to revolutionary politics.\n\n**Film**\nThe novel has been adapted into a film, with the Swedish director Ingmar Bergman adapting the work in 1980. The film was a critical and commercial success, with Bergman praising the novel's innovative form and its commitment to revolutionary politics.\n\n**Musical recordings**\nThe novel has been the subject of numerous musical recordings, with some musicians drawing on the work's themes of resistance and rebellion.

The UPA was formed by the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN), a Ukrainian nationalist organization that sought to establish an independent Ukrainian state.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists\n\nThe Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN) was founded in 1929 by Andriy Melnyk and Stepan Bandera, two Ukrainian nationalist leaders. The OUN's primary goal was to establish an independent Ukrainian state, which it believed was essential for the preservation of Ukrainian culture and identity. The OUN was organized into two main factions: the OUN-M (Melnyk faction) and the OUN-B (Bandera faction). The OUN-B faction, which was led by Stepan Bandera, was more radical and militant than the OUN-M faction.\n\n### Outbreak of the war\n\nIn 1939, the Soviet Union invaded Poland and annexed Western Ukraine, which had previously been part of the Polish Second Republic. The annexation was met with widespread resistance from the Ukrainian population, who had long sought independence from Soviet rule. The OUN-B faction, which had been secretly organizing a resistance movement, saw the Soviet invasion as an opportunity to launch a full-scale uprising against Soviet rule.\n\n### Creation of OUN-B, pogroms, and anti-Soviet uprising\n\nIn June 1941, Germany invaded the Soviet Union, and the OUN-B faction saw an opportunity to launch a massive uprising against Soviet rule.

The Lakota religion is a distinct and unique spiritual tradition that is deeply connected to the natural world, the cosmos, and the social and cultural practices of the Lakota people.\n\n# Definition and Classification\n\nThe Lakota religion is often referred to as a \"spiritual tradition\" or a \"philosophy\" rather than a \"religion\" in the classical sense. This is because the Lakota people do not have a centralized authority or a dogmatic system of beliefs. Instead, the Lakota religion is a collective and individualistic spiritual practice that is deeply rooted in the culture and traditions of the Lakota people. The Lakota religion is often classified as a form of animism, which is a spiritual tradition that emphasizes the sacred and spiritual nature of the natural world.\n\n# Beliefs\n\n## Wakʽą and Wakʽą Tʽąką\n\nThe central concept of the Lakota religion is the Wakʽą, or the Great Spirit.

The Wakʽą and the Wakʽą Tʽąką are seen as interconnected and interdependent, and the Lakota people believe that they must live in harmony with both the natural and spiritual worlds.\n\n## Wakʽąpi\n\nThe Wakʽąpi, or the Six Grandfathers, are six powerful spirits that are believed to have created the universe and all living things.

The Lakota people believe that they must live in harmony with the natural world and respect the sacred and spiritual nature of all living things.\n\n### Šicųpi and Wašicu\n\nŠicųpi, or the helpers, are the spirits that are believed to assist the Lakota people in their daily lives. Wašicu, or the medicine men, are the spiritual leaders who possess the knowledge and power to communicate with the spirits and provide guidance and healing to the Lakota people.\n\n## Cosmology and the Sacred Hoop\n\nThe Lakota people believe in a complex and multifaceted cosmology that includes various spirits and beings that inhabit the universe. The Lakota people believe that the universe is a vast and interconnected web of life that is represented by the sacred hoop. The sacred hoop is a symbol of the interconnectedness of all living things and the balance and harmony that must exist between the natural and spiritual worlds.\n\n## Morality and Gender Roles\n\nThe Lakota people have a complex and multifaceted moral system that emphasizes the importance of living in harmony with the natural world and respecting the sacred and spiritual nature of all living things. The Lakota people believe that men and women have different roles and responsibilities in society, with men often serving as the spiritual leaders and women serving as the caregivers and nurturers.\n\n# Practices\n\n## Prayer and Offerings\n\nThe Lakota people believe in the importance of prayer and offerings to the spirits and the natural world. The Lakota people believe that prayer and offerings can provide guidance, healing, and protection to the individual and the community.\n\n### Suffering and Sacrifice\n\nThe Lakota people believe that suffering and sacrifice are necessary for spiritual growth and development.

{"title": "Sun_Belt", "content": "#Migration\n#Definition\n#Projections\n#Politics\n#Environment\n#Major cities\n#See also\n#References\n#Further reading\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Sun Belt**\n\nThe Sun Belt is a region in the southeastern and southwestern United States that is characterized by a warm and subtropical climate. The term was originally coined in the 1960s to describe the area's rapid population growth and economic development. Today, the Sun Belt is a diverse region that encompasses a wide range of cultures, economies, and ecosystems.\n\n**Migration**\n\nThe Sun Belt has experienced significant migration patterns throughout its history. During the early 20th century, many African Americans migrated from the rural South to urban areas in the Sun Belt, seeking better economic opportunities and social mobility. This migration was fueled by the Great Migration, which saw millions of African Americans leave the rural South for cities in the North and West.\n\nIn the post-World War II era, the Sun Belt experienced a massive influx of new residents, driven by the growth of the defense industry and the expansion of the interstate highway system. Many people from the Northeast and Midwest moved to the Sun Belt for its warm climate, job opportunities, and lower cost of living.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, the Sun Belt experienced a second wave of migration, driven by the growth of the service sector and the expansion of the tourism industry. Many retirees and snowbirds (seasonal residents) moved to the Sun Belt, drawn by its warm climate and recreational opportunities.\n\nToday, the Sun Belt continues to experience rapid population growth, driven by its strong economy, diverse culture, and high quality of life. According to the United States Census Bureau, the Sun Belt is home to over 100 million people, representing over 30% of the country's population.\n\n**Definition**\n\nThe Sun Belt is a region that encompasses several states in the southeastern and southwestern United States. The exact boundaries of the Sun Belt are somewhat subjective, but it generally includes the following states:\n\n* Alabama\n* Arizona\n* Arkansas\n* Florida\n* Georgia\n* Louisiana\n* Mississippi\n* New Mexico\n* North Carolina\n* Oklahoma\n* South Carolina\n* Tennessee\n* Texas\n\nThe Sun Belt is characterized by a warm and subtropical climate, with long summers and mild winters. The region is also known for its diverse geography, which includes coastal plains, mountains, and deserts.\n\n**Projections**\n\nThe Sun Belt is expected to continue to experience rapid population growth in the coming decades. According to the United States Census Bureau, the region's population is projected to grow by over 50% by 2050, driven by its strong economy, diverse culture, and high quality of life.\n\nThe Sun Belt's population growth is expected to be driven by a combination of natural increase (the difference between births and deaths) and net migration (the difference between people moving into the region and people moving out). The region's strong economy and high quality of life are expected to continue to attract new residents, particularly from the Northeast and Midwest.\n\n**Politics**\n\nThe Sun Belt is a diverse region that encompasses a wide range of cultures, economies, and politics. The region has historically been a stronghold of the Republican Party, but in recent years it has become more competitive, with both parties winning elections in various states.\n\nThe Sun Belt has been at the center of many significant political battles, including the civil rights movement of the 1960s and the immigration reform debate of the 2000s. The region has also played a key role in shaping national policy on issues such as healthcare, education, and the environment.\n\nToday, the Sun Belt continues to be a battleground for national elections, with both parties competing for votes in various states. The region's diverse culture and economy make it an important testing ground for new ideas and policies.\n\n**Environment**\n\nThe Sun Belt is a region of diverse ecosystems, including coastal plains, mountains, and deserts.

It is the premier international Twenty20 (T20) cricket tournament, featuring national teams from around the world. The tournament is held every two years, with the first edition taking place in 2007.\n\n# History\n\n## Background\n\nThe idea of a T20 World Cup was first proposed by the ICC in 2002, in response to the growing popularity of Twenty20 cricket. At the time, domestic T20 tournaments were gaining momentum, and the ICC saw an opportunity to create a global event that would bring together the best teams and players in the format.\n\n### Domestic tournaments\n\nDomestic T20 tournaments had been gaining popularity in the early 2000s, with leagues such as the Indian Premier League (IPL) and the Big Bash League (BBL) attracting massive crowds and generating significant revenue. These tournaments helped to establish the popularity of T20 cricket and paved the way for the creation of an international tournament.\n\n### Twenty20 Internationals\n\nTwenty20 Internationals (T20Is) had also been gaining traction in the early 2000s, with the first T20I match played in 2005. The format quickly gained popularity, and by 2007, T20Is had become a regular feature of international cricket.\n\n## Inaugural edition\n\nThe first ICC Men's T20 World Cup was held in South Africa in 2007, with 12 teams participating in the tournament. The event was a huge success, with the Indian team winning the inaugural title by defeating Pakistan in the final.\n\n## Expansion to 16 teams\n\nThe tournament expanded to 16 teams in 2009, with the addition of three new teams: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Ireland. This expansion marked a significant increase in the number of participating teams and helped to establish the tournament as a major international event.\n\n## Expansion to 20 teams\n\nIn 2016, the tournament expanded to 16 teams. The 2021 tournament will see the introduction of two new teams: Scotland and Ireland will be replaced by the United Arab Emirates and Namibia.\n\n# Hosts\n\nThe ICC Men's T20 World Cup has been hosted by several countries and territories, including:\n\n* South Africa (2007)\n* England (2009)\n* Sri Lanka (2012)\n* Bangladesh (2014)\n* India (2016)\n* Australia and New Zealand (2020)\n* United Arab Emirates and Oman (2022)\n\n# Formats\n\n## Qualification\n\nQualification for the ICC Men's T20 World Cup is determined by a combination of factors, including team rankings, tournament results, and qualification tournaments. The top teams from each region are automatically qualified for the tournament, while the remaining spots are filled through a series of qualification tournaments.\n\n## Final tournament\n\nThe final tournament features the 16 participating teams, who compete in a round-robin group stage followed by a knockout stage. The top two teams from each group advance to the knockout stage, where they compete in a series of matches to determine the champion.\n\n# Trophy\n\nThe ICC Men's T20 World Cup trophy is a silver trophy featuring a cricket ball design.

This surgical intervention is designed to restore vision and improve the quality of life for individuals with cataracts. Cataract surgery is a common and highly effective procedure, with millions of operations performed worldwide each year.\n\n**Uses**\n\nCataract surgery is used to treat cataracts, which are a clouding of the lens in the eye that can cause vision loss and blindness. There are several types of cataracts, including:\n\n* Age-related cataracts: These are the most common type, developing as people age.\n* Traumatic cataracts: These occur after an eye injury.\n* Congenital cataracts: These are present at birth.\n* Secondary cataracts: These develop as a result of another eye condition or disease.\n\n**Techniques**\n\nThere are several techniques used in cataract surgery, including:\n\n* Phacoemulsification: This is the most common technique, where the cloudy lens is broken up and removed using an ultrasonic device.\n* Manual small incision cataract surgery (MSICS): This technique involves making a small incision in the cornea and removing the cloudy lens in one piece.\n* Extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE): This technique involves removing the cloudy lens in one piece while leaving the elastic capsule that surrounds it intact.\n\n**Pre-operative evaluation**\n\nBefore undergoing cataract surgery, a thorough evaluation is necessary to determine the best course of treatment. This includes:\n\n### Contraindications\n\nCertain conditions may contraindicate cataract surgery, including:\n\n* Severe eye disease, such as glaucoma or macular degeneration\n* Active infection or inflammation in the eye\n* Previous eye surgery that has not healed properly\n* Inability to follow post-operative instructions\n\n### Selection of intraocular lenses\n\nThe type and power of the intraocular lens (IOL) to be used will depend on the individual's prescription and the type of cataract surgery being performed.\n\n**Operation procedures**\n\n### Preparation\n\nBefore the surgery, the patient will typically undergo:\n\n* Review of the eye's condition and the planned procedure\n* Administration of local anesthesia\n* Preparation of the eye with antiseptic solution\n\n### Anaesthesia\n\nLocal anesthesia is usually used to numb the eye, and in some cases, sedation may be administered to help the patient relax.\n\n### Phacoemulsification\n\nThis is the most common technique used in cataract surgery. The surgeon makes a small incision in the cornea and uses an ultrasonic device to break up the cloudy lens. The fragments are then removed through the incision.\n\n### Manual small incision cataract surgery (MSICS)\n\nThis technique involves making a small incision in the cornea and removing the cloudy lens in one piece.\n\n### Extracapsular cataract extraction\n\nThis technique involves removing the cloudy lens in one piece while leaving the elastic capsule that surrounds it intact.\n\n### Converting to ECCE to manage a contingency\n\nIn some cases, the surgeon may need to convert from phacoemulsification to extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE) due to complications during surgery.\n\n### Closing the wound\n\nThe incision is usually closed with sutures or a special type of glue to minimize the risk of infection and promote healing.\n\n**Post-operative care**\n\nAfter cataract surgery, the patient will typically need to:\n\n* Apply eye drops to reduce inflammation and promote healing\n* Avoid heavy lifting or bending\n* Avoid rubbing or touching the eye\n* Follow up with the surgeon for regular check-ups\n\n**Complications**\n\nComplications can occur during or after cataract surgery, including:\n\n### During surgery\n\n* Damage to the retina or macula\n* Infection or inflammation\n* Hemorrhage or bleeding\n\n### After surgery\n\n* Dry eye or decreased tear production\n* Infection or inflammation\n* Cystoid macular edema\n\n### Risk\n\nThe risk of complications can be minimized by choosing an experienced surgeon and following post-operative instructions carefully.\n\n**Recovery and rehabilitation**\n\nRecovery from cataract surgery can take several weeks to several months, depending on the individual's overall health and the type of surgery performed. During this time, the patient may need to wear an eye patch or protective shield to protect the eye from accidental injury.\n\n**Outcomes**\n\nCataract surgery is a highly effective procedure, with most patients experiencing improved vision and a significant reduction in symptoms. The success of the surgery depends on various factors, including the type and severity of the cataract, the type of surgery performed, and the patient's overall health.\n\n**History**\n\nCataract surgery has a long history dating back to ancient civilizations. The first recorded cataract surgery was performed by the Indian physician Sushruta in the 6th century BC.\n\n**Accessibility**\n\nCataract surgery is widely available in many parts of the world, including:\n\n* Europe\n* Asia\n* Africa\n* Latin America\n\n**Social, economic and environmental relevance**\n\nCataract surgery has significant social, economic, and environmental relevance, as it can improve the quality of life for millions of people worldwide. The surgery can also reduce the economic burden on individuals and families by reducing the need for costly treatments and lost productivity.\n\n**Special populations**\n\nCataract surgery is particularly relevant for certain special populations, including:\n\n* **Congenital cataracts**: These are present at birth and can cause significant vision loss if left untreated.\n* **Higher risk for operations on separate occasions**: Individuals who have had previous eye surgery or have certain medical conditions may be at higher risk for complications during cataract surgery.\n\n**Other animals**\n\nCataract surgery is also performed on animals, including dogs and cats, to improve their vision and quality of life.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Ophthalmology\n* Eye surgery\n* Cataract\n* Intraocular lens\n\n**Notes**\n\n* Cataract surgery is a highly effective procedure, but it is not without risks and complications.\n* The success of the surgery depends on various factors, including the type and severity of the cataract, the type of surgery performed, and the patient's overall health.\n* Cataract surgery has significant social, economic, and environmental relevance, as it can improve the quality of life for millions of people worldwide.\n\n**References**\n\n* American Academy of Ophthalmology.

As the war ravaged the country, the black market emerged as a vital outlet for goods and services, often operating outside the official channels of distribution and supply. This article will examine the origins, development, and consequences of the black market in wartime France, as well as its impact on the broader cultural and historical landscape.\n\n**Background**\n\n### 1930s: Inflation, Instability, and Unrest\n\nThe 1930s were marked by economic instability and social unrest in France. The global economic crisis of 1929 had a devastating impact on the French economy, leading to high levels of unemployment and poverty. Inflation rose sharply, eroding the purchasing power of the average citizen and creating widespread discontent. This economic instability created fertile ground for the black market to emerge and thrive.\n\n### Fall of France\n\nThe fall of France in May 1940 marked a turning point in the country's history, as the German occupation brought with it a new era of economic hardship and repression. The German authorities imposed strict rationing and price controls, which only served to exacerbate the shortages and shortages that already existed. The black market, which had been operating in the shadows for some time, began to flourish as a means of circumventing these controls and accessing essential goods.\n\n**1940-1941**\n\n### Origins\n\n#### Rationing and Price Controls\n\nThe German authorities imposed strict rationing and price controls on essential goods, including food, fuel, and clothing. These controls created a shortage of goods, which in turn drove the demand for black market goods. The black market became a means of accessing goods that were not available through official channels.\n\n#### Diversion from Official Channels\n\nAs the black market grew, it became increasingly difficult to distinguish between official and black market goods. Merchants and traders began to divert goods from official channels into the black market, where they could be sold at inflated prices.\n\n#### Clandestine Networks\n\nThe black market relied on a network of clandestine connections between suppliers, merchants, and buyers. These networks were often established through personal relationships and trust, rather than formal agreements or contracts.\n\n#### Hidden Stockpiling\n\nMany merchants and traders began to stockpile goods, hiding them from the authorities and selling them on the black market. This created a surplus of goods, which further fueled the black market.\n\n#### Grey Market\n\nThe black market also gave rise to the \"grey market,\" where goods were sold at prices that were higher than official prices but lower than those on the black market. The grey market operated in a grey area between the official and black markets, and was often seen as a more legitimate outlet for goods.\n\n**Users of the Black Market**\n\n### Privileged French\n\nThe black market was not limited to the occupation forces; many French citizens, including those in positions of power, also participated in the black market. The wealthy and privileged classes were often able to access goods through the black market, using their connections and resources to acquire essential goods.\n\n### Occupation Forces\n\nThe German occupation forces also used the black market to access goods and services. The occupation authorities imposed strict controls on the movement of goods and people, but the black market allowed them to circumvent these controls and access the goods they needed.\n\n**Public Response**\n\n### Early Condemnation\n\nThe black market was widely condemned by the French public, who saw it as a symbol of the occupation and the corrupting influence of power. Many people viewed the black market as a morally corrupt activity, and those who participated in it were seen as unpatriotic.\n\n### Participation\n\nDespite the condemnation, many people participated in the black market, either as buyers or sellers. The black market offered a means of accessing essential goods, and many people saw it as a necessary evil.\n\n### Housewives' Demonstrations\n\nIn 1941, housewives began to demonstrate against the shortages and shortages, calling for the authorities to do more to address the crisis. The demonstrations highlighted the impact of the black market on ordinary people and the need for the authorities to take action.\n\n### Suspicions of Hoarding\n\nAs the black market grew, there were suspicions that some people were hoarding goods, rather than selling them on the black market. The authorities began to crack down on hoarding, but the practice continued to exist.\n\n### Official Antisemitism\n\nThe black market also gave rise to official antisemitism, as the occupation authorities used the black market as a pretext to target Jewish merchants and traders. The authorities claimed that the Jewish community was responsible for the black market, and used this as a justification for their persecution.\n\n### Public Opinion\n\nPublic opinion on the black market was complex and nuanced. While many people condemned the black market, others saw it as a necessary evil. The black market was often seen as a means of accessing essential goods, and many people participated in it without feeling guilty.\n\n### Political Opposition\n\nThe black market also gave rise to political opposition to the occupation. Many people saw the black market as a symbol of the occupation's corruption and inefficiency, and used it as a rallying cry for resistance.\n\n**Response by Authorities**\n\n### No Longer Immoral\n\nAs the black market grew, the occupation authorities began to see it as a necessary evil. The authorities realized that the black market was a means of accessing goods and services, and began to tolerate it.\n\n### Nuanced and Refocused Enforcement\n\nThe authorities began to enforce the laws and regulations related to the black market in a more nuanced and targeted way. They focused on cracking down on the most egregious cases of hoarding and profiteering, while leaving smaller-scale traders and buyers alone.\n\n**Metrics**\n\n### Proportion of Production\n\nEstimates suggest that the black market accounted for a significant proportion of production in France during the war. The exact figure is difficult to determine, but it is believed to have been around 20-30% of total production.\n\n### Higher and More Volatile Prices\n\nPrices on the black market were higher and more volatile than those on the official market. The prices of essential goods such as food and fuel varied widely, depending on the location and the time of year.\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\nThe black market was not evenly distributed throughout France. The largest cities, such as Paris and Lyon, had the most developed black markets, while smaller towns and rural areas had smaller and less organized markets.\n\n### Beneficiaries\n\nThe beneficiaries of the black market were varied, but included merchants and traders who profited from the trade, as well as ordinary people who were able to access essential goods through the market.\n\n**Patriotism (Spring 1943-Summer 1944)**\n\n### Enforcement for the Occupiers\n\nAs the war turned in favor of the Allies, the occupation authorities began to enforce the laws and regulations related to the black market more strictly. The authorities saw the black market as a threat to their control and began to crack down on it.\n\n### Economic Pillage and the End of the German Black Market\n\nThe German black market began to decline as the Allies advanced and the occupation authorities lost control. The Allies also began to engage in economic pillage, seizing goods and assets from the occupation authorities and their collaborators.\n\n### Countermeasures and Collaboration\n\nThe occupation authorities responded to the decline of the black market by implementing countermeasures, such as price controls and rationing. They also collaborated with other governments and organizations to try to maintain control over the economy.\n\n### Milice vs the Black Market\n\nThe Milice, a French collaborationist militia, also began to crack down on the black market. The Milice saw the black market as a threat to their control and began to arrest and execute those who participated in it.\n\n**Fraud and Resistance**\n\n### Resistance Encouragement\n\nThe black market also gave rise to resistance movements, as many people saw it as a means of resisting the occupation. The black market was often used to fund and supply the resistance, and many people participated in both activities.\n\n### Blaming the Resistance\n\nThe occupation authorities also blamed the resistance for the black market. They claimed that the resistance was responsible for the shortages and shortages, and used this as a justification for their persecution.\n\n### End of the Occupation\n\nAs the Allies advanced, the occupation authorities lost control over the black market. The black market began to decline, and many people began to participate in the official economy.\n\n**After the Liberation (1944-1949)**\n\n### Épuration and Illicit Profits\n\nAs the occupation authorities were purged, many people who had participated in the black market were punished. The government also confiscated illicit profits and assets, and many people were forced to return goods and services they had acquired through the black market.\n\n### Pursuit and Punishment\n\nThe pursuit and punishment of those who had participated in the black market continued for many years. Many people were arrested, tried, and punished for their involvement in the black market.\n\n### Confiscation of Illicit Profits\n\nThe government also confiscated illicit profits and assets, and many people were forced to return goods and services they had acquired through the black market.\n\n### Continued Black Market Operations\n\nDespite the efforts to eradicate the black market, it continued to operate in various forms. Many people continued to trade and sell goods on the black market, often using new and creative means to evade detection.\n\n### Continued Trafficking\n\nThe black market also continued to involve the trafficking of goods and people. Many people continued to smuggle goods across borders, and some even continued to engage in human trafficking.\n\n### Generalized Fraud\n\nThe black market also gave rise to generalized fraud, as many people began to cheat and deceive others in order to gain an advantage. The black market created a culture of dishonesty and deceit, and many people began to question the morality of their actions.\n\n### Government Powerlessness\n\nThe government was powerless to stop the black market, and many people began to question the effectiveness of the authorities. The black market continued to thrive, and many people began to lose faith in the government.\n\n### Towards the Free Market\n\nAs the black market continued to operate, many people began to advocate for a free market economy. The black market showed that people were willing to take risks and engage in entrepreneurship, and many people began to see the benefits of a free market economy.\n\n# Historical Memory\n\n## Historiography\n\nHistorians have approached the black market in France during World War II with a range of perspectives and interpretations. Some have seen the black market as a symbol of resistance and rebellion, while others have viewed it as a manifestation of corruption and collaboration.\n\n## Collective Unconscious and Cultural Roots\n\nThe black market in France during World War II has also been seen as a manifestation of the collective unconscious and cultural roots of the French people. Many people saw the black market as a means of accessing essential goods and services, and of resisting the occupation.\n\n## Early Recollections\n\nMany people have early recollections of the black market, and of the ways in which it affected their daily lives. These recollections often highlight the difficulties and challenges of living under occupation, and the ways in which people came together to resist and survive.\n\n## Marcel Aymé\n\nThe French writer Marcel Aymé wrote extensively about the black market in his novels and short stories. Aymé's works often explored the ways in which the black market affected everyday life, and the moral complexities of participation in the market.\n\n## Major Works\n\nAymé's major works include La Traversée de Paris and Au bon beurre, both of which explore the black market and its impact on French society.\n\n## Historical Figures\n\nThe black market in France during World War II also gave rise to a range of historical figures, including traders, merchants, and resistance fighters. These figures often played complex and multifaceted roles, and their stories have been told and retold in a range of different ways.\n\n# See also\n\n* French Resistance\n* German occupation of France\n* Black market\n* World War II\n* Economic history of France\n\n# Notes\n\n* The black market in France during World War II was a complex and multifaceted phenomenon, and this article has only scratched the surface of its history and impact.\n* Further research and study is needed to fully understand the black market and its role in French society during this time.\n* The black market in France during World War II continues to be a topic of interest and debate, and its legacy can still be seen in modern-day French society.\n\n# References\n\n## Citations\n\n* Aymé, M.
