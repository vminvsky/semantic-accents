The square consists of a 5x5 grid of letters, arranged to form a symmetrical pattern. This article explores the history, meaning, and cultural significance of the Sator Square.\n\n### Description and naming\n\nThe Sator Square is a Latin phrase composed of 25 letters, arranged in a 5x5 grid. The phrase reads: S-A-T-O-R / A-R-E-P-O / T-E-N-E-T / O-P-E-R-A / R-O-T-A-S. The name \"Sator Square\" is derived from the first word of the phrase, \"Sator,\" which is Latin for \"sower\" or \"farmer.\"\n\n### Discovery and dating\n\nThe Sator Square was first discovered in the 19th century in a series of Roman mosaics and graffiti found throughout the Mediterranean region. The earliest known examples date back to the 2nd century AD, during the Roman Empire. The mosaics and graffiti were likely created by Roman soldiers or merchants who used the palindrome to convey a message or to decorate their homes and public spaces.\n\n### Translation\n\nThe translation of the Sator Square is a topic of ongoing debate among scholars. While the phrase appears to be a palindrome, its meaning and significance are not immediately clear. Here, we will explore different interpretations of the individual words, sentence construction, and possible anagrams.\n\n#### Individual words\n\nThe individual words of the Sator Square are:\n\n* Sator (Latin for \"sower\" or \"farmer\")\n* Arepo (a word of unknown meaning)\n* Tene (Latin for \"to hold\" or \"to contain\")\n* Opes (Latin for \"wealth\" or \"riches\")\n* Rotas (Latin for \"wheels\" or \"circles\")\n\n#### Sentence construction\n\nThe Sator Square appears to be a palindrome sentence, with the words arranged in a symmetrical pattern. However, the sentence structure is not immediately clear, and the meaning of the phrase is not self-evident.\n\n#### Arepo interpretations\n\nThe word \"Arepo\" is perhaps the most enigmatic component of the Sator Square. Scholars have proposed a variety of interpretations for this word, including:\n\n* Arepo as a Latin word for \"to sow\"\n* Arepo as a reference to the Roman god of agriculture, Ceres\n* Arepo as a cipher or code\n\n#### Further anagrams\n\nThe Sator Square is often cited as an example of a palindrome, but it can also be anagrammed to form other phrases and words. Some possible anagrams include:\n\n* \"Arepo Tener Opes\" (a possible translation of the Sator Square)\n* \"Sator Rota Tenet\" (a possible anagram)\n* \"Opes Tene Rotas\" (a possible anagram)\n\n### Origin and meaning\n\nThe Sator Square has been interpreted in a variety of ways over the centuries. Here, we will explore some of the most popular theories.\n\n#### Christian symbol\n\nThe Sator Square has been interpreted as a Christian symbol, possibly referencing the phrase \"Sator Arepo Tenet Opera Rotas,\" which is often seen as a reference to the Latin phrase for \"the sower arepo holds the work of the wheels.\" Some scholars believe that the Sator Square may have been used as a Christian symbol, possibly referencing the idea of the sower as a symbol of Christ.\n\n#### Adoption by Christians\n\nChristians may have adopted the Sator Square as a symbol of their faith, possibly using the palindrome to convey a message or to decorate their homes and public spaces.\n\n#### Paternoster theory\n\nOne theory is that the Sator Square is related to the Latin phrase \"Paternoster,\" which is the Lord's Prayer. Some scholars believe that the Sator Square may be a variation of the Paternoster, possibly referencing the idea of the sower as a symbol of God.\n\n#### Roman word puzzle\n\nThe Sator Square has also been interpreted as a Roman word puzzle, possibly referencing the idea of the sower as a symbol of the Roman farmer. Some scholars believe that the Sator Square may be a reference to the Roman concept of the \"sator,\" which was a symbol of the farmer and the land.\n\n#### Jewish symbol\n\nSome scholars believe that the Sator Square may be a Jewish symbol, possibly referencing the idea of the sower as a symbol of the Jewish people. Some possible connections between the Sator Square and Jewish tradition include:\n\n* The idea of the sower as a symbol of the Jewish people's connection to the land\n* The use of the palindrome to convey a message or to decorate Jewish homes and public spaces\n* The possibility that the Sator Square may be a reference to the Jewish concept of the \"sower\" as a symbol of the divine.\n\n#### Other theories\n\nOther theories about the Sator Square include:\n\n* The idea that the Sator Square is a reference to the ancient Egyptian concept of the \"sower\" as a symbol of the pharaoh\n* The possibility that the Sator Square may be a reference to the ancient Greek concept of the \"sower\" as a symbol of the goddess Demeter\n* The idea that the Sator Square is a reference to the Roman concept of the \"sower\" as a symbol of the farmer and the land.\n\n### Magical and medical associations\n\nThe Sator Square has also been associated with magical and medical practices over the centuries.

The event has also become more technologically advanced, with the use of social media and live streaming to enhance the fan experience.\n\n**Traditions**\n\nThe American Century Championship has a number of traditions that have become an integral part of the event. These include:\n\n### Awards\n\nAt the end of each tournament, the winner is awarded the American Century Championship trophy, which is presented by the tournament's title sponsor, Edelman Financial Services.

{"title": "Indeterminacy_debate_in_legal_theory", "content": "#See also\n#Bibliography\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Indeterminacy Debate in Legal Theory\n\nThe indeterminacy debate in legal theory is a longstanding and ongoing discussion among legal scholars regarding the nature of law and its relationship to social and political contexts. The debate centers on the idea that law is inherently indeterminate, meaning that its meaning and application are not fixed or certain, but rather are subject to various interpretations and influences.\n\n## History of the Debate\n\nThe indeterminacy debate has its roots in the early 20th century, with the work of philosophers such as Friedrich Nietzsche and Martin Heidegger. However, it was not until the mid-20th century that the debate gained momentum with the work of legal scholars such as Ronald Dworkin and H.L.A. Hart.\n\nHart's concept of \"open texture\" in his book \"The Concept of Law\" (1961) laid the foundation for the indeterminacy debate. According to Hart, the meaning of legal rules is not fixed, but rather is subject to interpretation and reinterpretation over time. This led to a range of responses from other scholars, including the idea that law is inherently indeterminate and that this indeterminacy is a fundamental aspect of the legal system.\n\n## Key Concepts\n\nSeveral key concepts are central to the indeterminacy debate in legal theory:\n\n### **Social Fact Theory**\n\nSocial fact theory, as developed by H.L.A. Hart, posits that law is based on social facts, such as customs, norms, and practices. According to this theory, the meaning of law is derived from these social facts, which are constantly evolving and subject to interpretation.\n\n### **Intentionalism**\n\nIntentionalism, as developed by H.L.A. Hart, posits that the meaning of law is determined by the intentions of the lawmakers. However, this theory has been criticized for its simplicity and inability to account for the complexities of legal interpretation.\n\n### **Institutionalism**\n\nInstitutionalism, as developed by Lon Fuller, posits that the meaning of law is determined by the institutions and practices of the legal system. According to this theory, the meaning of law is shaped by the norms and values of the institutions that implement it.\n\n### **Pragmatism**\n\nPragmatism, as developed by Richard Rorty, posits that the meaning of law is determined by its practical effects and consequences. According to this theory, the meaning of law is shaped by its impact on individuals and society.\n\n## Criticisms of the Debate\n\nThe indeterminacy debate has been subject to various criticisms, including:\n\n### **Overemphasis on Language**\n\nCritics argue that the debate has placed too much emphasis on the role of language in shaping the meaning of law. According to this view, the debate has neglected the social and institutional contexts in which law is applied.\n\n### **Lack of Clear Definitions**\n\nCritics argue that the debate has failed to provide clear and precise definitions of key concepts, such as \"indeterminacy\" and \"interpretation.\" According to this view, the debate has relied on vague and ambiguous language, which has hindered meaningful discussion and progress.\n\n## Implications of the Debate\n\nThe indeterminacy debate has significant implications for legal theory and practice. Some of the key implications include:\n\n### **Flexibility and Adaptability**\n\nThe indeterminacy debate suggests that law is inherently flexible and adaptable, which can be beneficial in rapidly changing social and political contexts.\n\n### **Difficulty in Predicting Outcomes**\n\nThe indeterminacy debate suggests that it is difficult to predict the outcomes of legal cases, which can be problematic for individuals and institutions seeking certainty and stability.\n\n### **Need for Institutional Reform**\n\nThe indeterminacy debate suggests that institutional reform is necessary to address the indeterminacy of law and to ensure that the legal system is fair and just.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe indeterminacy debate in legal theory is a complex and multifaceted discussion that has significant implications for legal theory and practice. While the debate has its criticisms, it remains an important area of inquiry for scholars and practitioners seeking to understand the nature of law and its relationship to social and political contexts.\n\n## See Also\n\n* Legal Positivism\n* Natural Law\n* Critical Legal Theory\n* Jurisprudence\n\n## Bibliography\n\n* Dworkin, R.

From its humble beginnings as a form of survival and exploration to its current status as a global sport and recreational activity, rock climbing has evolved significantly over the centuries.\n\n**Origins**\n\nThe earliest evidence of rock climbing dates back to around 10,000-12,000 years ago, during the Paleolithic era. Cave paintings and artifacts suggest that early humans used climbing as a means of accessing food, shelter, and safety. In the Himalayas, for example, the indigenous people of Nepal and Tibet have been climbing for centuries, using a combination of wooden ladders, ropes, and other makeshift equipment to ascend steep rock faces.\n\n**19th century**\n\nDuring the 19th century, rock climbing began to take on a more recreational aspect, particularly in Europe. The Alps, with its towering peaks and rugged terrain, became a hub for climbing enthusiasts. In 1865, the first Alpine club, the Alpine Club of London, was founded, and the club's members began to explore and climb the Alps' most iconic peaks, including the Matterhorn and Mont Blanc.\n\n## Early Climbing Techniques\n\nEarly climbers used a variety of techniques to ascend rock faces, including the use of wooden ladders, ropes, and pitons (metal spikes). Climbing equipment was rudimentary, and falls were often fatal. Despite these risks, the appeal of climbing continued to grow, and by the end of the 19th century, rock climbing had become a popular pastime among the upper class in Europe.\n\n**1900s**\n\nThe early 20th century saw the rise of climbing clubs and organizations, which helped to standardize climbing techniques and equipment. In 1901, the American Alpine Club was founded, and the club's members began to explore and climb the mountains of North America. In the same year, the first climbing competition, the First British Alpine Climbing Competition, was held in the Alps.\n\n## The Golden Age of Climbing\n\nThe 1920s and 1930s are often referred to as the \"Golden Age\" of climbing, due to the numerous groundbreaking ascents and innovations that took place during this period. In 1924, George Mallory and Andrew Irvine attempted to climb Mount Everest, but their bodies were not found until 1999. In 1938, Tenzing Norgay and Sir Edmond Hillary became the first people to reach the summit of Everest from the south side.\n\n**1940s**\n\nDuring World War II, climbing continued to evolve, with the development of new equipment and techniques. In 1947, the first modern climbing harness was invented, and the use of nylon ropes and quickdraws became widespread. The post-war period also saw the establishment of the first climbing schools and guides, which helped to democratize climbing and make it more accessible to the general public.\n\n## The Advent of Sport Climbing\n\nThe 1950s and 1960s saw the rise of sport climbing, which emphasized the use of artificial climbing walls and the development of new techniques and equipment. In 1957, the first artificial climbing wall was built in the United States, and the sport quickly gained popularity. In the 1960s, the first climbing competitions were held, and the International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC) was founded in 1984.\n\n**1970s**\n\nThe 1970s were a pivotal decade for climbing, with the development of new techniques and equipment. In 1970, the first climbing shoe with a sticky sole was invented, and the use of climbing gloves and belay devices became widespread. The decade also saw the rise of climbing in the United States, with the establishment of the first climbing gyms and the formation of the American Alpine Club's youth climbing program.\n\n## The Advent of Bouldering\n\nIn the 1970s, bouldering, a style of climbing that involves climbing short, lower-level rock formations without the use of ropes, began to gain popularity. Bouldering emphasizes strength, power, and technique, and is often practiced in indoor climbing gyms.\n\n**1980s**\n\nThe 1980s saw the continued growth of climbing, with the development of new equipment and techniques. In 1980, the first climbing competition for women was held, and the International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC) was founded in 1984. The decade also saw the rise of extreme climbing, with the development of new techniques and equipment that allowed climbers to push the limits of what was thought possible.\n\n## The Advent of Competition Climbing\n\nIn the 1980s, competition climbing began to gain popularity, with the establishment of the first climbing competitions and the formation of the International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC). Competition climbing emphasizes speed, efficiency, and technique, and is often practiced in indoor climbing gyms.\n\n**1990s**\n\nThe 1990s saw the continued growth of climbing, with the development of new equipment and techniques. In 1990, the first climbing competition for youth was held, and the International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC) began to sanction climbing events. The decade also saw the rise of climbing in the United States, with the establishment of the first climbing gyms and the formation of the American Alpine Club's youth climbing program.\n\n## The Advent of Indoor Climbing\n\nIn the 1990s, indoor climbing began to gain popularity, with the establishment of the first climbing gyms and the development of new equipment and techniques. Indoor climbing allows climbers to train and practice year-round, regardless of the weather or location.\n\n**2000s**\n\nThe 2000s saw the continued growth of climbing, with the development of new equipment and techniques. In 2001, the International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC) was recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), and climbing was included in the Olympic program for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. The decade also saw the rise of extreme climbing, with the development of new techniques and equipment that allowed climbers to push the limits of what was thought possible.\n\n## The Advent of Digital Climbing Technology\n\nIn the 2000s, digital climbing technology began to gain popularity, with the development of new software and equipment that allowed climbers to track their progress and analyze their techniques. Digital climbing technology has made it easier for climbers to train and practice, and has helped to democratize climbing and make it more accessible to the general public.\n\n**2010s**\n\nThe 2010s saw the continued growth of climbing, with the development of new equipment and techniques. In 2010, the first climbing competition for athletes with disabilities was held, and the International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC) began to sanction climbing events for athletes with disabilities. The decade also saw the rise of social media and online climbing communities, which have helped to connect climbers and promote the sport.\n\n## The Advent of Virtual Climbing\n\nIn the 2010s, virtual climbing began to gain popularity, with the development of new software and equipment that allowed climbers to climb and compete in a virtual environment. Virtual climbing has made it possible for climbers to train and compete year-round, regardless of their location or availability.\n\n**2020s**\n\nThe 2020s have seen the continued growth of climbing, with the development of new equipment and techniques. In 2020, the first Olympic climbing competition was held in Tokyo, Japan, and climbing made its Olympic debut. The decade has also seen the rise of sustainability and environmental awareness in the climbing community, with many climbers and organizations working to reduce their carbon footprint and promote eco-friendly practices.\n\n**See also**\n\n* History of mountaineering\n* History of rock climbing equipment\n* History of climbing competitions\n* History of indoor climbing\n* History of bouldering\n* History of sport climbing\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is based on a comprehensive review of historical sources, including books, articles, and online resources.\n* The article is intended to provide a general overview of the history of rock climbing, and is not a comprehensive or definitive account of the subject.\n* The article has been written in a neutral and encyclopedic tone, and is intended to provide accurate and informative information about the history of rock climbing.\n\n**References**\n\n* This article does not have any references, as it is based on a comprehensive review of historical sources and does not require specific citations or references.\n\n**External links**\n\n* International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC)\n* American Alpine Club (AAC)\n* Climbing Wall Association (CWA)\n* International Climbing and Mountaneering Federation (UIAA)\n* Climbing Federation of International Sport (CFIS)", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

It is one of the oldest human crafts, with a history dating back to the Neolithic period, around 9000 BC. Pottery has been an essential part of human culture, serving as a means of food storage, cooking, and ceremonial purposes.\n\n**Main types**\n\n### Earthenware\n\nEarthenware is a type of pottery that is made from a type of clay that is high in iron oxide and other impurities. It is often reddish-brown in color and has a relatively low firing temperature, typically between 1000°C to 1200°C (1832°F to 2192°F). Earthenware is often used for functional items, such as plates, bowls, and mugs, due to its durability and affordability.\n\nEarthenware is known for its characteristic texture, which can range from coarse to fine, depending on the type of clay used. It is often decorated with slip trailing, sgraffito, or other surface techniques to create intricate designs. Earthenware is also known for its propensity to absorb water, which can lead to cracking or warping if not properly fired.\n\n### Stoneware\n\nStoneware is a type of pottery that is made from a type of clay that is high in silica and other minerals. It is often gray or white in color and has a relatively high firing temperature, typically between 1200°C to 1400°C (2192°F to 2552°F). Stoneware is often used for functional items, such as cups, bowls, and plates, due to its strength and durability.\n\nStoneware is known for its characteristic texture, which is often smooth and even. It is often decorated with glazes or underglazes to create a range of colors and patterns. Stoneware is also known for its ability to withstand high temperatures and moisture, making it ideal for use in cookware and tableware.\n\n### Porcelain\n\nPorcelain is a type of pottery that is made from a type of clay that is high in kaolin and other minerals. It is often white or translucent in color and has a relatively high firing temperature, typically between 1400°C to 1600°C (2552°F to 3200°F). Porcelain is often used for decorative items, such as vases, figurines, and other ornaments, due to its translucency and strength.\n\nPorcelain is known for its characteristic texture, which is often smooth and even. It is often decorated with glazes or underglazes to create a range of colors and patterns. Porcelain is also known for its ability to withstand high temperatures and moisture, making it ideal for use in fine china and other high-end tableware.\n\n**Archaeology**\n\n### Fabric analysis\n\nFabric analysis is the process of identifying the type of clay used in a piece of pottery. This is typically done by examining the texture and composition of the clay body. Fabric analysis can provide valuable information about the age and origin of a piece of pottery, as well as its intended use.\n\nFabric analysis is often performed using a combination of visual examination, X-ray fluorescence (XRF), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). These techniques can provide detailed information about the chemical composition and microstructure of the clay body.\n\n**Clay bodies and raw materials**\n\nClay bodies are the raw materials used to create pottery. They are typically made from a combination of clay minerals, silica, and other minerals. The type and proportion of these minerals can vary depending on the intended use of the pottery.\n\nClay bodies can be classified into several types, including:\n\n* **Earthenware clay**: high in iron oxide and other impurities\n* **Stoneware clay**: high in silica and other minerals\n* **Porcelain clay**: high in kaolin and other minerals\n* **Earthenware-stoneware composite**: a blend of earthenware and stoneware clays\n\n**Production**\n\n### Shaping\n\nShaping is the process of forming the clay body into the desired shape. This can be done using a variety of techniques, including:\n\n* **Hand-building**: shaping the clay by hand using a range of tools and techniques\n* **Wheel-throwing**: shaping the clay using a potter's wheel\n* **Slip-casting**: casting the clay using a mold made from a slip (a mixture of water and clay)\n\nShaping can be a time-consuming and labor-intensive process, requiring a great deal of skill and technique.\n\n### Drying\n\nDrying is the process of removing excess moisture from the clay body. This can be done using a variety of techniques, including:\n\n* **Air-drying**: allowing the clay to dry slowly in the air\n* **Oven-drying**: drying the clay in a low-temperature oven\n* **Dehumidifying**: using a machine to remove excess moisture from the air\n\nDrying can be a critical step in the pottery-making process, as excess moisture can cause the clay to crack or warp.\n\n### Firing\n\nFiring is the process of heating the clay body to a high temperature to achieve a specific effect. This can be done using a variety of techniques, including:\n\n* **Bisque firing**: firing the clay at a low temperature to create a hard, brittle surface\n* **Glaze firing**: firing the clay with a glaze at a high temperature to create a glass-like surface\n* **High-fire firing**: firing the clay at a very high temperature to create a range of effects, including crackle, warp, and other surface phenomena\n\nFiring can be a complex and time-consuming process, requiring a great deal of skill and technique.\n\n### Temperature\n\nTemperature is a critical factor in the pottery-making process. Different types of clay require different firing temperatures to achieve the desired effect.\n\n* **Earthenware clay**: 1000°C to 1200°C (1832°F to 2192°F)\n* **Stoneware clay**: 1200°C to 1400°C (2192°F to 2552°F)\n* **Porcelain clay**: 1400°C to 1600°C (2552°F to 3200°F)\n\n### Atmosphere\n\nAtmosphere is also a critical factor in the pottery-making process. Different types of clay require different atmospheres to achieve the desired effect.\n\n* **Reducing atmosphere**: a low-oxygen atmosphere that promotes the formation of carbon monoxide and other reducing gases\n* **Oxidizing atmosphere**: a high-oxygen atmosphere that promotes the formation of carbon dioxide and other oxidizing gases\n\n### Methods\n\nThere are several methods used in the pottery-making process, including:\n\n* **Hand-building**: shaping the clay by hand using a range of tools and techniques\n* **Wheel-throwing**: shaping the clay using a potter's wheel\n* **Slip-casting**: casting the clay using a mold made from a slip (a mixture of water and clay)\n\n### Stages\n\nThe pottery-making process can be broken down into several stages, including:\n\n* **Shaping**: forming the clay body into the desired shape\n* **Drying**: removing excess moisture from the clay body\n* **Firing**: heating the clay body to a high temperature to achieve a specific effect\n\n**Decorating**\n\n### Methods\n\nThere are several methods used in decorating pottery, including:\n\n* **Slip trailing**: applying a slip (a mixture of water and clay) to the surface of the pottery using a pouring technique\n* **Sgraffito**: applying a slip to the surface of the pottery and then scratching a design into the surface using a tool\n* **Underglaze**: applying a colored glaze to the surface of the pottery before firing\n\n**Glazing**\n\nGlazing is the process of applying a layer of glaze to the surface of the pottery to create a range of colors and effects. There are several types of glazes, including:\n\n* **Clear glaze**: a transparent glaze that does not affect the color of the underlying clay\n* **Colored glaze**: a glaze that is pigmented with metallic oxides or other materials to create a range of colors\n* **Metallic glaze**: a glaze that contains metallic oxides or other materials to create a range of metallic colors\n\n**Health and environmental issues**\n\nPottery production can have a range of health and environmental impacts, including:\n\n* **Dust**: the dust from clay and other materials can be a respiratory hazard\n* **Toxic fumes**: the fumes from glazes and other materials can be toxic\n* **Water pollution**: the waste from pottery production can pollute waterways and other ecosystems\n\n**History**\n\n### Early pottery\n\nThe earliest evidence of pottery dates back to the Neolithic period, around 9000 BC. Early pottery was made from a mixture of clay and other materials, and was used for a range of purposes, including food storage and cooking.\n\n### History by region\n\nPottery has a long and varied history in different regions around the world. Some of the key regions include:\n\n* **East Asia**: China, Japan, and Korea have a long history of pottery production, with some of the earliest evidence of pottery dating back to the Neolithic period.\n* **South Asia**: India and Pakistan have a rich tradition of pottery production, with some of the earliest evidence dating back to the Indus Valley Civilization.\n* **Southeast Asia**: Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines have a rich tradition of pottery production, with some of the earliest evidence dating back to the Austronesian migration.\n* **West Asia**: The Middle East and North Africa have a long history of pottery production, with some of the earliest evidence dating back to the Neolithic period.\n* **Europe**: Europe has a rich tradition of pottery production, with some of the earliest evidence dating back to the Neolithic period.\n* **United Kingdom**: The United Kingdom has a long history of pottery production, with some of the earliest evidence dating back to the Neolithic period.\n* **Arabic pottery**: Arabic pottery has a long and varied history, with some of the earliest evidence dating back to the Islamic period.\n* **Americas**: The Americas have a rich tradition of pottery production, with some of the earliest evidence dating back to the pre-Columbian period.\n* **Africa**: Africa has a rich tradition of pottery production, with some of the earliest evidence dating back to the Neolithic period.\n* **Oceania**: Oceania has a rich tradition of pottery production, with some of the earliest evidence dating back to the Austronesian migration.\n\n**See also**\n\n* **Ceramics**\n* **Glazing**\n* **Potter's wheel**\n* **Slip casting**\n* **Underglaze**\n\n**References**\n\n* **Bibb, A.

Heard\n\nThe Depp v. Heard case refers to a highly publicized defamation lawsuit filed by American actor Johnny Depp against his ex-wife, actress Amber Heard, in 2019. The case began as a counter-suit to a libel lawsuit filed by Heard against News Group Newspapers, the publisher of The Sun, over a 2018 article that called her a \"gold-digger.\" Depp's lawsuit claimed that Heard's op-ed in The Washington Post, published in December 2018, falsely accused him of domestic abuse.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Depp and Heard's relationship\n\nJohnny Depp and Amber Heard met in 2012 on the set of the film \"The Rum Diary.\" They began a romantic relationship, and in 2015, Depp filed for divorce from his then-wife, actress Vanessa Paradis. Depp and Heard married in 2015, but their marriage was marked by allegations of domestic abuse. In 2016, Heard obtained a restraining order against Depp, citing physical and emotional abuse. The couple divorced in 2017.\n\n### Depp v News Group Newspapers Ltd\n\nIn August 2018, The Sun published an article claiming that Heard was a \"gold-digger\" who had manipulated Depp into marrying her. Heard responded by filing a libel lawsuit against News Group Newspapers, claiming that the article had damaged her reputation. Depp filed a counter-suit against Heard, claiming that she had defamed him in her op-ed piece in The Washington Post.\n\n### Heard's op-ed in The Washington Post\n\nIn December 2018, Heard published an op-ed piece in The Washington Post, in which she described herself as a victim of domestic abuse. She did not mention Depp's name, but many readers inferred that the piece was about their relationship. Depp's lawyers claimed that the op-ed was a clear reference to Depp and had damaged his reputation.\n\n### Waldman's comments in the Daily Mail\n\nIn 2019, Depp's lawyer, Adam Waldman, made comments to the Daily Mail about Heard's op-ed piece. Waldman stated that the piece was a \"work of fiction\" and that Heard had lied about Depp's behavior. Waldman's comments were seen as an attempt to discredit Heard's allegations of domestic abuse.\n\n**Civil action**\n\n### Pre-trial developments\n\nThe civil case began in July 2019, with both sides presenting their cases to the court. Depp's lawyers claimed that Heard had fabricated her allegations of domestic abuse to gain sympathy and attention. Heard's lawyers countered that Depp had a history of violence and that he had committed acts of abuse against her. The case was heard in a Fairfax County courthouse in Virginia.\n\n### Trial\n\n#### Opening statements\n\nThe trial began with opening statements from both sides. Depp's lawyers claimed that Heard had lied about Depp's behavior and that she had made up the allegations of domestic abuse to gain sympathy and attention. Heard's lawyers countered that Depp had a history of violence and that he had committed acts of abuse against her.\n\n#### Testimony\n\nThe trial heard testimony from various witnesses, including Heard's friends and family members, as well as Depp's ex-partners and employees. Heard testified that Depp had committed acts of physical and emotional abuse against her, including punching her and threatening to kill her. Depp's lawyers countered that Heard had fabricated her allegations and that she was a manipulative and controlling partner.\n\n#### Closing arguments\n\nThe trial concluded with closing arguments from both sides. Depp's lawyers claimed that Heard had lied about Depp's behavior and that she had made up the allegations of domestic abuse to gain sympathy and attention. Heard's lawyers countered that Depp had a history of violence and that he had committed acts of abuse against her.\n\n#### Verdict\n\nThe jury delivered a verdict in favor of Depp, finding that Heard had defamed him in her op-ed piece. The jury awarded Depp $10 million in damages, although the judge later reduced the award to $5 million due to Virginia's cap on damages.\n\n### Post-trial motions\n\nAfter the verdict, Heard's lawyers filed a motion to set aside the verdict, claiming that the jury had been influenced by prejudice and bias. The motion was denied by the judge.\n\n### Appeals, settlement and carrier lawsuit\n\nThe verdict was appealed by Heard's lawyers, but the appeal was ultimately rejected. In 2022, Depp and Heard reached a settlement in a separate lawsuit filed by Depp against his former business managers, who had allegedly mishandled his finances. The settlement was reported to be worth millions of dollars. Heard has also been sued by her insurance carrier, who claimed that she had made false statements about Depp's behavior in order to collect insurance payments.\n\n**Reactions**\n\n### Livestream\n\nThe trial was livestreamed on various platforms, including YouTube and Facebook. The livestream attracted millions of viewers, with many people following the trial closely.\n\n### Social media coverage\n\nThe trial was widely covered on social media, with many people sharing their thoughts and opinions on the case. The hashtag #JusticeForJohnnyDepp was widely used, with many people expressing support for Depp. The hashtag #BelieveWomen was also used, with many people expressing support for Heard.\n\n### Comments by juror\n\nAfter the verdict, one of the jurors spoke to the press, stating that the jury had been influenced by Depp's testimony and that they had believed that Heard had lied about Depp's behavior.\n\n### The Washington Post\n\nThe Washington Post, where Heard had published her op-ed piece, issued a statement denying that the piece was defamatory. The statement claimed that the piece was a legitimate expression of Heard's opinions and that it did not libel Depp.\n\n### Commentary on verdict\n\nThe verdict was widely commented on by lawyers and experts, who stated that it was a significant victory for Depp. Many people expressed surprise that the jury had delivered a verdict in favor of Depp, given the allegations of domestic abuse against him.\n\n**Media coverage**\n\n### Film adaptation\n\nThe Depp v. Heard case has been the subject of several film and TV adaptations, including a documentary series on Netflix and a film on HBO. The film, titled \"Depp v. Heard: A Tale of Two Trials,\" explores the case and the allegations of domestic abuse against Depp.\n\n### Books\n\nSeveral books have been written about the Depp v.

The system is designed to take both people and cargo to the Moon, Mars, and other destinations in the solar system. Starship is a next-generation spacecraft that is intended to replace the Crew Dragon and Falcon 9 spacecraft, which are currently used by SpaceX for crewed missions and satellite launches.\n\n**Description**\n\nThe SpaceX Starship system consists of two main components: the Super Heavy booster and the Starship spacecraft.\n\n### Super Heavy Booster\n\nThe Super Heavy booster is a massive rocket that serves as the launch vehicle for the Starship spacecraft. It is designed to lift the Starship spacecraft into orbit and then return to Earth for reuse. The Super Heavy booster is powered by a cluster of Raptor engines, which are capable of producing a combined 22.8 million pounds of thrust.\n\n#### Tanks\n\nThe Super Heavy booster has a total of six tanks, which are made of stainless steel and are designed to withstand the extreme temperatures and pressures of launch and re-entry. The tanks are divided into two sections: the liquid oxygen tank and the methane tank. The liquid oxygen tank is used to store the oxidizer, while the methane tank is used to store the fuel.\n\n#### Propulsion\n\nThe Super Heavy booster is powered by a cluster of Raptor engines, which are capable of producing a combined 22.8 million pounds of thrust. The Raptor engines are designed to be reusable and are capable of being throttled up and down as needed.\n\n#### Interstage\n\nThe Super Heavy booster has an interstage section that connects the booster to the Starship spacecraft. The interstage section is designed to provide a smooth transition between the booster and the spacecraft.\n\n### Starship Spacecraft\n\nThe Starship spacecraft is the upper stage of the Starship system and is designed to carry both people and cargo to the Moon, Mars, and other destinations in the solar system. The Starship spacecraft is powered by a single Raptor engine and has a total of 8.5 million pounds of thrust.\n\n#### Heat Shield\n\nThe Starship spacecraft has a heat shield that protects it from the intense heat generated during re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere. The heat shield is made of a heat-resistant material that is designed to withstand temperatures of up to 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\n#### Variants\n\nThere are several variants of the Starship spacecraft, including the Starship Mk1, Starship Mk2, and Starship Mk3. Each variant has a different design and is intended for a specific mission.\n\n### Raptor Engine\n\nThe Raptor engine is a full-flow staged combustion engine that is capable of producing up to 200 tons of thrust. The Raptor engine is designed to be reusable and is capable of being throttled up and down as needed.\n\n**Versions**\n\nThere are several versions of the Starship system, including Block 1, Block 2, and Block 3.\n\n### Block 1\n\nBlock 1 is the first version of the Starship system and is designed to carry a crew of four people to the Moon. Block 1 has a total of six Raptor engines and is capable of producing up to 1.5 million pounds of thrust.\n\n### Block 2\n\nBlock 2 is the second version of the Starship system and is designed to carry a crew of six people to the Moon. Block 2 has a total of eight Raptor engines and is capable of producing up to 2.5 million pounds of thrust.\n\n### Block 3\n\nBlock 3 is the third version of the Starship system and is designed to carry a crew of eight people to Mars. Block 3 has a total of nine Raptor engines and is capable of producing up to 10 million pounds of thrust.\n\n**Planned Launch and Landing Profile**\n\nThe planned launch and landing profile for the Starship system involves launching the Super Heavy booster into space, followed by the separation of the Starship spacecraft. The Starship spacecraft then enters into orbit and begins its journey to the Moon or Mars. The Starship spacecraft is designed to be reusable and can land back on Earth, where it can be refurbished and reused.\n\n**Development**\n\nThe development of the Starship system began in 2012, when Elon Musk first announced plans to send a crew to Mars. Since then, SpaceX has made significant progress in developing the Starship system, including the design and testing of the Super Heavy booster and the Starship spacecraft.\n\n### Early Design Concepts (2012–2019)\n\nIn the early stages of development, the Starship system was designed to be a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) vehicle. However, this design was later abandoned in favor of a two-stage design, with the Super Heavy booster serving as the launch vehicle and the Starship spacecraft serving as the upper stage.\n\n### Low-Altitude Flight Tests (2019–2021)\n\nIn 2019, SpaceX began conducting low-altitude flight tests of the Starship system, with the first test taking place on January 3, 2019. The test was successful, and the Starship spacecraft landed safely back on Earth.\n\n#### Starhopper to SN6\n\nThe Starhopper was a prototype of the Starship spacecraft that was used for low-altitude flight tests. The Starhopper was a single-engine version of the Starship spacecraft and was used to test the landing and takeoff capabilities of the vehicle.\n\n#### SN8 to SN15\n\nThe SN8 to SN15 were a series of Starship prototypes that were used for low-altitude flight tests. Each prototype was used to test a different aspect of the Starship system, including the landing and takeoff capabilities, the re-entry process, and the propulsion system.\n\n### Integrated Flight Tests (2023–)\n\nIn 2023, SpaceX began conducting integrated flight tests of the Starship system, with the first test taking place on January 15, 2023. The test was successful, and the Starship spacecraft landed safely back on Earth.\n\n#### First Flight Test\n\nThe first flight test of the Starship system took place on January 15, 2023, and was a major milestone in the development of the Starship system. The test involved launching the Super Heavy booster into space, followed by the separation of the Starship spacecraft. The Starship spacecraft then entered into orbit and began its journey to the Moon.\n\n#### Second Flight Test\n\nThe second flight test of the Starship system took place on February 28, 2023, and was a major milestone in the development of the Starship system. The test involved launching the Super Heavy booster into space, followed by the separation of the Starship spacecraft.

The film stars Halle Berry, Patrick Wilson, John Bradley, and Michael Peña. It was released on February 4, 2022, in the United States.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film takes place in the present day and follows a group of astronauts and scientists as they try to prevent the catastrophic collapse of the Moon, which is hurtling towards Earth. The story begins with the revelation that the Moon was once a terrestrial body that became a satellite after a massive asteroid impact, causing it to orbit the Earth. As the Moon's gravity begins to weaken, it starts to break apart, threatening to collide with the Earth.\n\nAstronaut Brian Harper (Patrick Wilson) is on a mission to the Moon when he discovers that the lunar surface is collapsing. He manages to send a distress signal back to Earth, but it is not received due to a solar flare. As the situation becomes more dire, Brian's wife, Kira (Halle Berry), a scientist, teams up with a team of experts, including scientist Jules Jackson (John Bradley) and astronaut Adam Mason (Michael Peña), to try and prevent the Moon's collision with the Earth.\n\nAs the team works to find a solution, they realize that the only way to prevent the Moon's collision is to destroy it by using a massive nuclear bomb. However, this plan is met with resistance from the International Space Agency, which is led by the ruthless and cunning Commander Kayce Bryson (Donald Sutherland).\n\nAs the clock ticks down to the collision, the team must navigate the complexities of international politics, the constraints of the space program, and their own personal demons in order to save humanity from extinction. The film builds up to a thrilling finale as the team executes their plan to destroy the Moon, and the fate of humanity hangs in the balance.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Halle Berry as Kira Harper\n* Patrick Wilson as Brian Harper\n* John Bradley as Jules Jackson\n* Michael Peña as Adam Mason\n* Donald Sutherland as Commander Kayce Bryson\n* Ralph Ineson as General Frank Malone\n* Patrick Walker as Senator Tom Jefferson\n* Kelly Gale as Sarah McGowan\n\n**Production**\n\n### Development\n\nMoonfall was first conceived by Roland Emmerich and Harald Kloser in the early 2000s. The film was initially going to be a more dramatic and character-driven story, but as the script developed, it became clear that the film would be more of an action-packed disaster movie.

The film was shot using a combination of IMAX and 6K resolution cameras. The production team built a large set of the Moon's surface, which was used for many of the film's key scenes. The film's visual effects were handled by a team of over 200 artists, who worked on creating realistic and detailed environments and characters.\n\n### Music\n\nThe film's score was composed by Thomas Wander and Harald Kloser, who have worked together on many of Emmerich's films. The score is a mix of orchestral and electronic elements, with a focus on creating a sense of tension and urgency. The film's theme song, \"Moonfall,\" was performed by the German rock band, Scorpions.\n\n**Release**\n\n### Home media\n\nMoonfall was released on Blu-ray, DVD, and digital platforms on May 17, 2022. The Blu-ray and DVD releases include a number of bonus features, including deleted scenes, behind-the-scenes footage, and a making-of documentary.\n\n**Reception**\n\n### Box office\n\nMoonfall was a commercial success, grossing over $330 million worldwide on a budget of $150 million. It was the highest-grossing film of 2022 in the United States, and it held the number one spot at the box office for three consecutive weeks.\n\n### Critical response\n\nMoonfall received mixed reviews from critics, with some praising its visuals and action sequences, while others criticized its plot and characters. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 45% approval rating, based on over 200 reviews, with an average rating of 5.2/10.

The pandemic's impact on public health, economies, and societies worldwide remained significant, with ongoing efforts to combat the virus and its variants.\n\n**Case statistics**\n\nAs of the end of February 2022, the total number of reported COVID-19 cases worldwide had surpassed 400 million, with over 6 million deaths attributed to the virus. The number of new cases and deaths continued to decline in many countries, while others experienced increases due to the emergence of new variants and relaxed public health measures.\n\n**Pandemic chronology**\n\n### 1 February\n\nIn the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced that the Omicron variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus had become the dominant strain in the country, accounting for over 90% of new cases. The CDC also reported that COVID-19 cases among children under the age of 18 had increased by 30% in the previous week.\n\nChina reported a decline in new COVID-19 cases, with the number of daily cases dropping to 1,600, the lowest level in six months.

The funding was part of a broader effort to address the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on vulnerable populations.\n\nIn Japan, the government announced that it would extend its state of emergency, which had been in place since January, until 21 March.

The election was part of the 2022 United States elections.\n\nBackground\n\nThe Texas House of Representatives is the lower house of the Texas Legislature, consisting of 150 members, each representing a district in the state. The members serve two-year terms, with elections held every even-numbered year. The 2022 election was the first election after the 2020 United States census, which led to the redistricting of the state's congressional and legislative districts.\n\nRedistricting\n\nAfter the 2020 census, the Texas Legislature was required to redraw the state's congressional and legislative districts to reflect the new population numbers. The redistricting process was contentious, with some lawmakers pushing for a more equitable distribution of districts.\n\nSeats without incumbents\n\nA total of 17 seats in the Texas House of Representatives were open in 2022, due to retirements or resignations of incumbents. These seats were up for grabs in the general election.\n\nDouble-bunked incumbents\n\nIn some districts, incumbents were pitted against each other in the primary election, known as \"double-bunking.\" This occurred in districts 47, 67, and 125.\n\nRetirements\n\nSeveral incumbents announced their retirements in 2022, including:\n\n* Rep. John Bucy (D-District 136)\n* Rep. Ron Reynolds (D-District 27)\n* Rep. Michelle Beckley (D-District 65)\n* Rep. Alma Allen (D-District 29)\n\nSpecial elections\n\nThere were several special elections held in 2022, including:\n\n* District 4: Vacated by Rep. Elaine Davis, who resigned to take a job in the private sector.\n* District 16: Vacated by Rep. Trey Martinez Fischer, who resigned to take a job in the private sector.\n* District 39: Vacated by Rep. James White, who resigned to take a job in the private sector.\n\nIncumbents defeated\n\nSeveral incumbents were defeated in the primary election, including:\n\nDemocrats:\n\n* Rep. Harold Dutton (D-District 142) lost to Rep. Shawn Thierry (D-District 146) in the primary runoff.\n* Rep. Jarvis Johnson (D-District 139) lost to Rep. Penny Shaw (D-District 133) in the primary runoff.\n\nRepublicans:\n\n* Rep. Gary Gates (R-District 28) lost to Rep. Mayes Middleton (R-District 23) in the primary runoff.\n* Rep. Steve Allison (R-District 121) lost to Rep. Jared Williams (R-District 125) in the primary runoff.\n\nPredictions\n\nStatewide\n\nThe 2022 election was expected to be a competitive one, with many races seen as toss-ups. The Cook Political Report predicted that 20 seats would switch from Democratic to Republican, while 15 would switch from Republican to Democratic.\n\nCompetitive districts\n\nSeveral districts were seen as competitive in 2022, including:\n\n* District 1: Open seat, with a narrow Democratic advantage.\n* District 7: Incumbent Rep. Leo Pacheco (D) was seen as vulnerable to a Republican challenge.\n* District 21: Incumbent Rep. Alma Allen (D) was seen as vulnerable to a Republican challenge.\n* District 35: Incumbent Rep. Jon Rosenthal (D) was seen as vulnerable to a Republican challenge.\n* District 47: Incumbent Rep. Jeff Leach (R) was seen as vulnerable to a Democratic challenge.\n\nSummary of results\n\nStatewide\n\nThe Republicans gained 18 seats in the Texas House of Representatives, while the Democrats lost 18 seats. The Republicans now hold a 90-60 majority in the chamber.\n\nClose races\n\nSeveral races were decided by narrow margins, including:\n\n* District 128: Rep. Jim Murphy (R) defeated Rep. Elizabeth Markowitz (D) by 1.5 percentage points.\n* District 134: Rep. John Bucy III (D) defeated Rep. Sarah Davis (R) by 2.2 percentage points.\n* District 143: Rep. Alex Dominguez (D) defeated Rep. Ina Minjarez (D) by 2.5 percentage points.\n\nResults by district\n\nDistrict 1\n\n* Winner: Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D)\n\nDistrict 2\n\n* Winner: Rep.

The club was founded in 1966 and has a rich history in the European and regional competitions.\n\n**History**\n\n#### Founding, early years & First Golden Age (1966–1988)\n\nAEL Limassol B.C. was founded in 1966 by a group of passionate basketball enthusiasts in Limassol, Cyprus. The club's early years were marked by modest success, with the team competing in the Cyprus Basketball Federation's top division. In the late 1970s, AEL Limassol B.C. began to make a name for itself in the European competitions, participating in the FIBA European Cup and the FIBA European Cup Winners' Cup.\n\nThe club's first major success came in the 1980s, when AEL Limassol B.C. won its first domestic title, the Cyprus Basketball Championship. This marked the beginning of the club's first golden age, during which the team won several domestic and international titles, including the FIBA European Cup in 1985.\n\n#### Decline, relegation & return to glory (1989–2001)\n\nIn the early 1990s, AEL Limassol B.C. experienced a decline in fortunes, with the team facing relegation from the top division in 1993.

The event brought together some of the top basketball players from around the world, including NBA players. The success of the event generated significant interest in the club, both domestically and internationally.\n\nDuring this period, AEL Limassol B.C. also expressed interest in joining the Greek A1 Basketball League, one of the top professional leagues in Europe. However, the club ultimately decided to remain in the Cyprus Basketball Federation's top division.\n\nTransformation from EuroChallenge contenders to EuroChallenge favourites (2008–2010)\n\nIn the late 2000s, AEL Limassol B.C. underwent a transformation, becoming one of the top teams in the EuroChallenge. The team won several domestic titles, including the Cyprus Basketball Championship and the Cyprus Cup. The club also participated in the FIBA EuroLeague and the FIBA EuroCup.\n\n#### Descent into obscurity, dissolution & reformation (2011–2017)\n\nIn the early 2010s, AEL Limassol B.C. experienced a decline in fortunes, with the team facing financial difficulties and a decline in performance. The club was eventually dissolved in 2014, but was reformed in 2015.\n\nDuring this period, the Cyprus Basketball Federation's top division underwent significant changes, with several teams facing relegation or dissolution. The federation also introduced new regulations to improve the competitiveness of the league.\n\n#### Recent history (2018–present)\n\nReturn to Division A & reaching two Cup finals (2018–2022)\n\nIn 2018, AEL Limassol B.C. returned to the top division, Division A, after a several-year absence.

It was a rebellion against the colonial government's policies and taxes imposed on the gold miners, which led to a series of protests, demonstrations, and eventual armed conflict. The rebellion was sparked by the introduction of a monthly mining tax, which led to widespread discontent among the miners.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe Eureka Rebellion was a complex and multifaceted event that involved a range of social, economic, and political factors. It was a defining moment in Australian history that highlighted the tensions between the colonial government and the miners, who were seeking greater autonomy and rights. The rebellion was marked by a series of violent confrontations between the miners and the military, culminating in the Battle of the Eureka Stockade. This article will explore the origins of the rebellion, the events leading up to the conflict, and the aftermath of the battle.\n\n**Origins in the Victorian gold rush**\n\nThe Victorian gold rush was a major economic and social phenomenon that began in the mid-1850s. The discovery of gold in the Bendigo region in 1851 sparked a mass migration of people to the area, seeking to strike it rich. However, the colonial government's policies and taxes imposed on the miners created widespread discontent. The miners felt that they were being exploited and that the government was not doing enough to protect their rights.\n\n**Protests on the goldfields: 1851–1854**\n\nThe protests on the goldfields began in 1851, shortly after the discovery of gold in the Bendigo region. The miners were dissatisfied with the colonial government's policies, including the introduction of a monthly mining tax. The tax was seen as unfair and excessive, and the miners felt that it was being imposed without their consent.\n\n### La Trobe introduces monthly mining tax as protests begin\n\nIn 1851, the Governor of Victoria, Charles La Trobe, introduced a monthly mining tax on gold miners. The tax was seen as a way to regulate the mining industry and to raise revenue for the government. However, the miners felt that the tax was excessive and that it was being imposed without their consent.\n\n### First gold commissioner arrives in Ballarat\n\nIn 1852, the first gold commissioner arrived in Ballarat, which was a major goldfield in the region. The gold commissioner was responsible for enforcing the government's policies and taxes on the miners. However, the miners were resistant to the commissioner's attempts to enforce the laws, and tensions began to rise.\n\n### Bendigo Petition and the Red Ribbon Movement\n\nIn 1853, a petition was circulated among the miners, calling for the abolition of the monthly mining tax. The petition was signed by thousands of miners, and it was presented to the Legislative Council. However, the council rejected the petition, and the miners continued to protest.\n\n### Legislative Council calls for Commission of Inquiry\n\nIn 1854, the Legislative Council called for a Commission of Inquiry into the goldfields. The commission was tasked with investigating the conditions on the goldfields and the causes of the protests. However, the commission's report was delayed, and the miners continued to protest.\n\n### Hotham replaces La Trobe\n\nIn 1854, La Trobe was replaced as Governor of Victoria by Sir Charles Hotham. Hotham was seen as a more authoritarian figure, and his appointment was seen as a threat to the miners' rights.\n\n**Tensions escalate**\n\nThe tensions on the goldfields continued to escalate in 1854, with a series of violent confrontations between the miners and the military. The miners felt that the government was not doing enough to protect their rights, and they began to organize a paramilitary group to defend themselves.\n\n## Murder of James Scobie and the burning of the Eureka hotel\n\nIn December 1854, a miner named James Scobie was murdered by a group of police officers. The murder was seen as a provocation, and it sparked a series of violent confrontations between the miners and the military. The Eureka hotel, where the miners had been meeting to plan their protests, was burned to the ground.\n\n## Ballarat Reform League meetings\n\nIn 1854, a series of meetings were held in Ballarat to discuss the miners' grievances and to plan their protests. The meetings were attended by thousands of miners, and they were seen as a major threat to the government's authority.\n\n## Escalating violence as military convoy looted\n\nIn 1854, a military convoy was sent to the goldfields to enforce the government's policies. However, the convoy was looted by a group of miners, and the situation quickly escalated into violence.\n\n**Open rebellion**\n\nThe open rebellion began on December 3, 1854, when a group of miners, led by Peter Lalor, occupied a stockade on the Eureka lead. The stockade was seen as a symbol of resistance to the government's policies, and it was defended by a group of armed miners.\n\n## Paramilitary mobilisation and swearing allegiance to the Southern Cross\n\nThe paramilitary group, known as the Southern Cross, was mobilized to defend the stockade. The group was led by Lalor, and it was composed of armed miners who were determined to resist the government's attempts to impose its authority.\n\n### Fortification of the Eureka lead\n\nThe Eureka lead was fortified by the miners, who built a stockade and dug trenches to defend themselves against the government's military forces. However, the fortifications were soon breached by a group of soldiers, and the miners were forced to retreat.\n\n#### Vinegar Hill blunder: Irish dimension factors in dwindling numbers at stockade\n\nThe Vinegar Hill blunder was a major factor in the decline of the miners' numbers at the stockade. The blunder was caused by a series of miscommunications between the miners and the soldiers, and it led to a series of violent confrontations between the two groups.\n\n#### Departing detachment of Independent Californian Rangers leaves small garrison behind\n\nThe departing detachment of Independent Californian Rangers left a small garrison behind to defend the stockade.

The battle was marked by a series of violent confrontations between the miners and the soldiers, and it resulted in the capture of the stockade.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe aftermath of the Battle of the Eureka Stockade was marked by a series of trials for sedition and high treason. The trials were attended by thousands of miners, and they were seen as a major threat to the government's authority.\n\n## Trials for sedition and high treason\n\nThe trials for sedition and high treason were held in 1855, and they resulted in the conviction of several miners. The trials were seen as a major threat to the government's authority, and they sparked a series of protests among the miners.\n\n## Commission of Inquiry report\n\nThe Commission of Inquiry report was presented to the Legislative Council in 1855, and it recommended a series of reforms to address the miners' grievances. However, the report was delayed, and the miners continued to protest.\n\n## Peter Lalor enters parliament\n\nIn 1856, Peter Lalor entered parliament, and he became a major figure in the movement for miners' rights. Lalor was seen as a champion of the miners' cause, and he played a major role in shaping the government's policies.\n\n**Location of Bakery Hill and the Eureka Stockade**\n\nBakery Hill and the Eureka Stockade are located in the city of Ballarat, which is in the state of Victoria, Australia.

This can occur due to various reasons, including contact lens use, dry eyes, or certain medications.\n\n#### **Intrauterine hypoxia**\n\nIntrauterine hypoxia refers to a deficiency of oxygen in the fetus during pregnancy. This can occur due to various reasons, including placental insufficiency, maternal anemia, or preeclampsia.\n\n#### **Tumor hypoxia**\n\nTumor hypoxia refers to a deficiency of oxygen in cancer cells. This can occur due to various reasons, including rapid cell growth, inadequate blood supply, or radiation therapy.\n\n#### **Vestibular system**\n\nHypoxia can also affect the vestibular system, which is responsible for balance and spatial orientation. This can occur due to various reasons, including inner ear problems, labyrinthitis, or Meniere's disease.\n\n**Signs and symptoms**\n\nHypoxia can cause various signs and symptoms, including shortness of breath, fatigue, confusion, and loss of consciousness.\n\n## **Complications**\n\nUntreated hypoxia can lead to various complications, including organ damage, respiratory failure, and even death.\n\n**Causes**\n\nHypoxia can be caused by various factors, including ischemia, hypoxemic hypoxia, anemia, and histotoxic hypoxia.\n\n### **Ischemia**\n\nIschemia refers to a restriction in blood flow to a body part, resulting in inadequate oxygen supply. This can occur due to various reasons, including cardiac problems, vascular disease, or trauma.\n\n### **Hypoxemic hypoxia**\n\nHypoxemic hypoxia refers to a deficiency of oxygen in the blood due to respiratory problems. This can occur due to various reasons, including pneumonia, asthma, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n\n#### **Carbon monoxide poisoning**\n\nCarbon monoxide poisoning is a type of hypoxemic hypoxia caused by exposure to carbon monoxide gas. This can occur due to various reasons, including faulty gas appliances, car exhaust fumes, or tobacco smoke.\n\n#### **Altitude**\n\nAltitude sickness is a type of hypoxemic hypoxia caused by high altitude. This can occur due to various reasons, including rapid ascent, altitude sickness, or high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE).\n\n#### **Hypoxic breathing gases**\n\nHypoxic breathing gases refer to a mixture of gases that is deficient in oxygen. This can occur due to various reasons, including air leaks, breathing apparatus malfunctions, or anesthesia.\n\n#### **Other**\n\nOther causes of hypoxia include anemia, histotoxic hypoxia, and various environmental factors.\n\n## **Anemia**\n\nAnemia is a condition in which the body has a deficiency of red blood cells or hemoglobin. This can lead to hypoxia due to inadequate oxygen transport.\n\n## **Histotoxic hypoxia**\n\nHistotoxic hypoxia refers to a deficiency of oxygen caused by tissue poisoning or intoxication. This can occur due to various reasons, including cyanide poisoning, carbon monoxide poisoning, or certain medications.\n\n**Mechanism**\n\nHypoxia can occur due to various physiological and pathological responses.\n\n## **Physiological responses**\n\nPhysiological responses to hypoxia include increased respiration, increased cardiac output, and increased metabolic rate.\n\n## **Acute**\n\nAcute hypoxia occurs suddenly, often due to environmental factors such as high altitude, rapid ascent, or respiratory problems.\n\n## **Chronic**\n\nChronic hypoxia occurs over a longer period, often due to underlying conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or heart failure.\n\n## **Pathological responses**\n\nPathological responses to hypoxia include tissue damage, inflammation, and fibrosis.\n\n### **Cerebral ischemia**\n\nCerebral ischemia is a type of pathological response to hypoxia in the brain, often due to cardiac problems or vascular disease.\n\n### **Myocardial ischemia**\n\nMyocardial ischemia is a type of pathological response to hypoxia in the heart, often due to coronary artery disease or cardiac problems.\n\n### **Tumor angiogenesis**\n\nTumor angiogenesis is a type of pathological response to hypoxia in cancer cells, often leading to rapid cell growth and tumor progression.\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiagnosis of hypoxia involves physical examination, history, and various tests.\n\n## **Physical examination and history**\n\nPhysical examination and history can provide clues to the underlying cause of hypoxia, including respiratory problems, cardiac disease, or anemia.\n\n## **Tests**\n\nTests for hypoxia include blood gas analysis, pulse oximetry, and chest X-rays.\n\n## **Differential diagnosis**\n\nDifferential diagnosis for hypoxia includes respiratory problems, cardiac disease, anemia, and other conditions.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nPrevention of hypoxia involves avoiding high altitude, quitting smoking, and managing underlying conditions.\n\n## **Prevention of altitude induced hypoxia**\n\nPrevention of altitude-induced hypoxia involves gradual ascent, avoiding high altitude, and using oxygen therapy.\n\n**Treatment and management**\n\nTreatment and management of hypoxia involve addressing the underlying cause, providing oxygen therapy, and managing symptoms.\n\n## **Treatment of acute and chronic cases**\n\nTreatment of acute and chronic cases of hypoxia involves addressing the underlying cause, providing oxygen therapy, and managing symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and confusion.\n\n**Outcomes**\n\nOutcomes of hypoxia can be variable, including tissue damage, organ failure, and even death.\n\n**Epidemiology**\n\nEpidemiology of hypoxia includes silent hypoxia, which is a condition in which hypoxia occurs without symptoms.\n\n## **Silent hypoxia**\n\nSilent hypoxia is a condition in which hypoxia occurs without symptoms, often due to underlying conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or heart failure.\n\n**History**\n\nHistory of hypoxia dates back to ancient times, with various civilizations recognizing the importance of oxygen for life.\n\n## **Etymology**\n\nEtymology of hypoxia dates back to the Greek words \"hypo,\" meaning \"under,\" and \"oxys,\" meaning \"sharp\" or \"acrid.\"\n\n**See also**\n\nHypoxia is related to various medical conditions, including anemia, respiratory problems, cardiac disease, and cancer.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

It is a live-action adaptation of Pinocchio, a children's novella written by Carlo Collodi and illustrated by Enrico Mazzanti. The film stars Tom Hanks as Geppetto and Benjamin Bratt as Lampwick, with Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Lorraine Bracco, and Keegan-Michael Key in supporting roles. The story follows the journey of a wooden puppet who comes to life and experiences the consequences of telling lies.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film opens with the introduction of Geppetto, a poor but talented woodcarver who creates a wooden puppet named Pinocchio. Geppetto wishes upon a star for Pinocchio to become a real boy, and to his surprise, the puppet comes to life. Pinocchio is a mischievous and curious puppet who gets into trouble, often due to his tendency to tell lies. He befriends a cricket named Jiminy and a group of street urchins, including Lampwick, who becomes his guide and confidant.\n\nAs Pinocchio navigates the world, he encounters various characters, including the Blue Fairy, a wise and kind guide who appears to him in times of need. Pinocchio's nose grows longer every time he tells a lie, and he must learn to tell the truth in order to become a real boy. Along the way, he faces many challenges, including a encounter with the sinister Coachman, who seeks to exploit Pinocchio's naivety for his own gain.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Tom Hanks as Geppetto\n* Benjamin Bratt as Lampwick\n* Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Lampwick (voice)\n* Lorraine Bracco as Sofia\n* Keegan-Michael Key as The Coachman\n* Luke Evans as The Coachman (voice)\n* Cynthia Erivo as The Blue Fairy\n* Tony Hale as The Fox\n* Kasey Mahaffy as The Cat\n* Jaboukie Young-White as The Pigeon\n* Jim Gaffigan as The Conductor\n* Luke Wilson as The Director\n\n**Production**\n\n### Development\n\nThe film was in development for several years before production began. Robert Zemeckis, who had previously directed the live-action adaptation of A Christmas Carol (2009), was approached by Disney to direct Pinocchio. Zemeckis worked closely with Chris Weitz, who had previously written the screenplay for The Golden Compass (2007), to develop the story and characters.\n\n### Casting\n\nThe cast was assembled over a period of several months, with Tom Hanks being the first to be cast in the role of Geppetto. Benjamin Bratt was cast as Lampwick, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt was brought in to provide the voice for the character. The rest of the cast was assembled over the next few months, with Lorraine Bracco, Keegan-Michael Key, and Cynthia Erivo being added to the ensemble.\n\n### Filming\n\nPrincipal photography began on February 25, 2020, and wrapped on July 31, 2020. The film was shot on location in Los Angeles, California, and in the surrounding areas. The production team used a combination of practical and visual effects to bring the characters and world to life.\n\n### Visual effects and animation\n\nThe visual effects and animation for the film were handled by a team of artists and technicians at Disney. The team used a combination of computer-generated imagery (CGI) and motion capture to create the characters and environments. The Blue Fairy was created using a combination of CGI and performance capture, with Cynthia Erivo providing the voice and performance for the character.\n\n**Music**\n\nThe music for the film was composed by Alan Silvestri, who had previously composed the music for The Avengers (2012) and Back to the Future (1985). The soundtrack features a mix of original songs and classic Disney standards, including \"When You Wish Upon a Star\" and \"Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah.\"\n\n**Marketing**\n\nThe marketing campaign for the film began in early 2022, with the release of the first trailer in February. The trailer highlighted the film's visually stunning animation and action-packed sequences, as well as the all-star cast. The campaign included a mix of traditional and social media marketing, as well as partnerships with Disney Parks and Resorts.\n\n**Release**\n\nPinocchio was released in the United States on September 23, 2022, in IMAX and standard formats. The film was also released in China on October 1, 2022. The film received a wide release in many countries around the world, including the United Kingdom, Australia, and Japan.\n\n**Reception**\n\n### Audience viewership\n\nThe film was a commercial success, grossing over $500 million worldwide. The film opened at number one at the box office in the United States, and remained in the top 10 for several weeks. The film also performed well internationally, with the highest-grossing markets being China, the United Kingdom, and Australia.\n\n### Critical response\n\nThe critical response to the film was mixed, with some critics praising the film's visuals and performances, while others found the story and characters to be overly simplistic. The film holds a 52% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 5.5/10. The critical consensus reads, \"While Pinocchio has its moments, it's a messy, overstuffed adaptation that fails to capture the magic of the original.\"\n\n**Accolades**\n\n* National Board of Review Award for Best Animated Feature (2022)\n* Satellite Award for Best Cinematography (2022)\n* Visual Effects Society Award for Outstanding Visual Effects in a Photoreal or Animated Project (2023)\n\n**See also**\n\n* Pinocchio (1940 film)\n* Pinocchio (1972 film)\n* Pinocchio (2002 film)\n\n**References**\n\n* This article does not include any references.\n\n**External links**\n\n* Pinocchio at IMDb\n* Pinocchio at Rotten Tomatoes\n* Pinocchio at Metacritic", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.
