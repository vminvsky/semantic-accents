It is characterized by a complex and multifaceted worldview that integrates elements of philosophy, theology, and mysticism. Neoplatonism has had a profound impact on Western thought, shaping the development of early Christianity, the Byzantine Empire, and Western Renaissance humanism.\n\n**Origins of the term**\n\nThe term \"Neoplatonism\" was first used in the 19th century to describe the philosophical movement that arose in the 3rd century AD. The term is derived from the Greek words \"νέος\" (neos), meaning \"new,\" and \"πλατωνισμός\" (platonismos), referring to the philosophical system of Plato. This term was chosen to distinguish the movement from the original Platonic tradition, which was considered to be more direct and straightforward.\n\n**Origins and history of classical Neoplatonism**\n\n### Hellenism\n\nThe Hellenistic period, which spanned from the 3rd to the 1st century BC, saw the rise of various philosophical schools in the Mediterranean world. This period laid the groundwork for the development of Neoplatonism, as it introduced the idea of a universal, interconnected world and the concept of a divine, all-encompassing principle.\n\n### Ammonius Saccas\n\nAmmonius Saccas, a philosopher from Alexandria, is considered the founder of Neoplatonism. He was a key figure in the development of the movement, drawing on the teachings of Plato, Aristotle, and other philosophers of the time. Ammonius emphasized the importance of spiritual practices, such as meditation and contemplation, as a means of achieving spiritual enlightenment.\n\n### Plotinus\n\nPlotinus, a student of Ammonius, is considered the most influential Neoplatonist philosopher. He developed the concept of the \"One,\" the ultimate reality that underlies all existence. Plotinus' philosophy emphasized the importance of the individual's return to the One, achieved through spiritual practices and the cultivation of virtues.\n\n### Porphyry\n\nPorphyry, a student of Plotinus, wrote several influential works on Neoplatonism, including the \"Isagoge,\" a comprehensive introduction to the subject. Porphyry's philosophy emphasized the importance of reason and intellect in understanding the nature of reality.\n\n### Iamblichus\n\nIamblichus, a Neoplatonist philosopher from Syria, developed a more mystical and ritualistic approach to Neoplatonism. He emphasized the importance of magical and theurgical practices in achieving spiritual enlightenment.\n\n### Academies\n\nThe Neoplatonists established a number of academies, or centers of learning, throughout the Mediterranean world. These academies served as hubs for philosophical and spiritual inquiry, attracting students and scholars from across the region.\n\n### Hypatia\n\nHypatia, a Neoplatonist philosopher and mathematician from Alexandria, was a prominent figure in the intellectual and spiritual life of her time. She was known for her wisdom, her love of learning, and her commitment to the teachings of Neoplatonism.\n\n### Proclus\n\nProclus, a Neoplatonist philosopher from Athens, was a leading figure in the development of Neoplatonism in the 5th century AD. He wrote extensively on the subject, emphasizing the importance of reason and intellect in understanding the nature of reality.\n\n**Ideas**\n\n### The One\n\nThe concept of the One, or the ultimate reality, is central to Neoplatonism. The One is considered to be the source of all existence, the ultimate principle that underlies all things.\n\n### Emanations\n\nThe idea of emanations, or the unfolding of the One into the world, is a key aspect of Neoplatonism. The world is seen as a series of emanations, or stages, that arise from the One.\n\n### Demiurge or nous\n\nThe concept of the Demiurge, or the divine craftsman, is an important aspect of Neoplatonism. The Demiurge is seen as the creator of the world, who brings forth the world from the One through a process of emanation.\n\n### World-soul\n\nThe world-soul is a concept that arises from the idea of emanations. The world-soul is seen as the animating principle of the world, the source of all life and energy.\n\n### Phenomenal world\n\nThe phenomenal world, or the world of appearances, is seen as a shadow or reflection of the true, eternal world. The phenomenal world is subject to change and impermanence.\n\n### Celestial hierarchy\n\nThe celestial hierarchy, or the order of the heavens, is seen as a reflection of the order of the universe. The celestial bodies are believed to be inhabited by various forms of life and consciousness.\n\n### Evil\n\nThe concept of evil is complex and multifaceted in Neoplatonism. Evil is seen as a privation or absence of being, a lack of the divine principle that underlies all existence.\n\n### Return to the One\n\nThe idea of return to the One, or the individual's return to the ultimate reality, is a central aspect of Neoplatonism. This is achieved through spiritual practices, such as meditation and contemplation, and the cultivation of virtues.\n\n**Influence**\n\n### Early Christianity\n\nNeoplatonism had a profound impact on early Christianity, influencing the development of Christian theology and spirituality. The idea of the Trinity, for example, was influenced by Neoplatonic concepts of the One and the emanations.\n\n### Augustine\n\nAugustine, a Christian philosopher and theologian, was heavily influenced by Neoplatonism. His philosophy emphasized the importance of reason and intellect in understanding the nature of reality.\n\n### Origen and Pseudo-Dionysius\n\nOrigen and Pseudo-Dionysius, two Christian theologians, were influenced by Neoplatonism in their writings on the nature of God and the universe.\n\n### Gnosticism\n\nGnosticism, a spiritual movement that emerged in the 2nd century AD, was influenced by Neoplatonism. Gnosticism emphasized the importance of spiritual knowledge and the attainment of gnosis, or spiritual insight.\n\n### Byzantine education\n\nNeoplatonism had a profound impact on Byzantine education, influencing the development of philosophical and theological thought in the Byzantine Empire.\n\n### Islamic neoplatonism\n\nIslamic neoplatonism, a philosophical and spiritual movement that emerged in the Islamic world, was heavily influenced by Neoplatonism. Islamic neoplatonism emphasized the importance of spiritual practices and the attainment of gnosis.\n\n### Jewish thought\n\nNeoplatonism had an influence on Jewish thought, particularly in the development of Kabbalah, a mystical tradition that emerged in the Middle Ages.\n\n### Medieval Christian Thought\n\nNeoplatonism had an influence on medieval Christian thought, influencing the development of Christian theology and spirituality.\n\n### Western Renaissance\n\nNeoplatonism had a profound impact on the Western Renaissance, influencing the development of humanism and the revival of classical learning.\n\n### Cambridge Platonists (17th century)\n\nThe Cambridge Platonists, a group of philosophers and theologians, were influenced by Neoplatonism in their writings on the nature of God and the universe.\n\n### Modern neoplatonism\n\nModern neoplatonism, a philosophical and spiritual movement, continues to draw on the ideas and principles of Neoplatonism. Modern neoplatonism emphasizes the importance of spiritual practices and the attainment of gnosis.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Ancient Greek philosophy\n* Plato\n* Aristotle\n* Stoicism\n* Epicureanism\n* Gnosticism\n* Kabbalah\n* Hermeticism\n* Theosophy\n* Esotericism\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is intended to provide a comprehensive overview of Neoplatonism.\n* The development of Neoplatonism is a complex and multifaceted process that spans several centuries.\n* The ideas and principles of Neoplatonism have had a profound impact on Western thought and culture.\n\n**References**\n\n* This article is based on a variety of sources, including the works of Plotinus, Porphyry, Iamblichus, and Proclus.\n* The development of Neoplatonism is also influenced by the works of other philosophers and theologians, including Plato, Aristotle, and the Christian Fathers.\n\n**Further reading**\n\n* Plotinus, \"The Enneads\"\n* Porphyry, \"Isagoge\"\n* Iamblichus, \"On the Mysteries\"\n* Proclus, \"The Platonic Theology\"\n* Augustine, \"The Confessions\"\n* Origen, \"On First Principles\"\n* Pseudo-Dionysius, \"The Mystical Theology\"\n* Kabbalistic texts, such as the \"Zohar\" and the \"Kabbalah of Rabbi Moses de Leon\"\n* Hermetic texts, such as the \"Corpus Hermeticum\"\n* Theosophical texts, such as the \"Secret Doctrine\" of Helena Blavatsky\n\n**External links**\n\n* Neoplatonism.org: A comprehensive online resource on Neoplatonism\n* The Neoplatonist Forum: A online forum for discussion of Neoplatonism\n* The Platonic Academy: A online resource on Plato and Neoplatonism", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

From its early beginnings in the 18th century to the present day, Ukrainian opera has evolved significantly, influenced by various cultural and artistic trends. This article provides an overview of the development of Ukrainian opera, highlighting its key milestones, notable composers, and significant events that have shaped the country's operatic tradition.\n\n**Origins**\n\n### Shkilʹna dramy (school dramas)\n\nThe origins of Ukrainian opera date back to the 18th century, when school dramas (shkilʹna dramy) were performed in Ukrainian-language schools. These amateur productions featured simple, folk-inspired music and were often based on Ukrainian folk tales and legends. While not formal operas, these school dramas laid the groundwork for the development of Ukrainian opera and helped to establish a sense of national identity through the use of the Ukrainian language.\n\n### Vertepy (nativity scenes)\n\nAnother early influence on Ukrainian opera was the vertepy (nativity scene), a traditional folk performance that depicted the life of Christ. Vertepy performances often featured music, dance, and storytelling, and were an important part of Ukrainian cultural heritage. The vertepy tradition influenced the development of Ukrainian opera, particularly in its use of folk elements and emphasis on storytelling.\n\n### Vaudeville\n\nIn the late 19th century, vaudeville became a popular form of entertainment in Ukraine. Vaudeville shows featured a mix of music, dance, and theater, and were often performed in Ukrainian or other languages spoken in the region. While not strictly opera, vaudeville shows paved the way for the development of more complex and sophisticated forms of Ukrainian musical theater.\n\n**Operetta**\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, operetta became a popular form of entertainment in Ukraine. Operetta shows were often based on light operas and featured a mix of music, dance, and comedy. Ukrainian operetta composers, such as Mykola Lysenko's contemporary, Mykola Lysenko's friend and fellow composer, Oleksandr Kolessa, created works that were both entertaining and culturally significant. Operetta played an important role in the development of Ukrainian opera, as it helped to establish a sense of national identity and cultural pride through the use of the Ukrainian language and folk elements.\n\n**Obstacles to the development of Ukrainian-language opera**\n\nDespite the growth of Ukrainian culture and language in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, there were still significant obstacles to the development of Ukrainian-language opera. The Russian Empire, which ruled Ukraine at the time, actively suppressed the use of the Ukrainian language and cultural expression. Many Ukrainian artists and intellectuals were forced to work in secret or emigrate to other countries in order to pursue their artistic goals.\n\n**Emergence of Ukrainian opera**\n\n### Mykola Lysenko\n\nMykola Lysenko is widely considered the father of Ukrainian opera. Born in 1842, Lysenko was a composer, pianist, and singer who dedicated his life to the development of Ukrainian music and culture. In 1864, Lysenko wrote his first opera, \"Taras Bulba,\" which was a critical and commercial success. Lysenko went on to write several more operas, including \"Babenka\" and \"Natalka Poltavka,\" which helped to establish Ukrainian opera as a distinct and important form of musical theater.\n\n### Lysenko's contemporaries and successors\n\nLysenko's contemporaries and successors, including composers such as Oleksandr Kolessa, Stanislav Liudkevych, and Mykola Skorulskyy, continued to develop and refine the art of Ukrainian opera. These composers, along with Lysenko, helped to create a unique and national style of opera that reflected the country's folk traditions, language, and cultural identity.\n\n**Period of resurgence**\n\n### 1910s\n\nIn the 1910s, Ukrainian opera experienced a period of resurgence, thanks in part to the efforts of Lysenko's contemporaries and successors. Composers such as Stanislav Liudkevych and Mykola Skorulskyy wrote new operas that were both critically and commercially successful. This period of resurgence helped to establish Ukrainian opera as a major force in the country's cultural scene.\n\n### 1920s and early 1930s\n\nIn the 1920s and early 1930s, Ukrainian opera continued to grow and develop. Composers such as Oleksandr Kolessa and Mykola Lysenko's student, Mykola Dmytrovych, wrote new operas that reflected the country's changing cultural and social landscape. This period also saw the establishment of several new opera companies and the construction of new opera houses, which helped to promote and develop Ukrainian opera.\n\n### Historical opera\n\nIn the 1920s and early 1930s, Ukrainian opera also experienced a period of historical opera, with composers such as Oleksandr Kolessa and Mykola Dmytrovych writing operas based on historical events and figures. This period saw the creation of operas such as Kolessa's \"Svitana\" and Dmytrovych's \"Levko,\" which helped to promote and develop Ukrainian opera and its unique national style.\n\n**Stalinism (1932–1956)**\n\nIn 1932, the Soviet government, led by Joseph Stalin, launched a campaign of forced assimilation against Ukraine's cultural and linguistic heritage. Ukrainian opera, along with other forms of Ukrainian cultural expression, was severely suppressed. Many Ukrainian artists and intellectuals were arrested, imprisoned, or forced into exile. Ukrainian opera houses were closed, and the use of the Ukrainian language was actively discouraged.\n\n### World War II\n\nDuring World War II, Ukrainian opera experienced a period of significant disruption and hardship. Many Ukrainian opera companies and artists were forced to flee their homes or were killed in the war. The war also saw the destruction of many Ukrainian opera houses and theaters.\n\n### 1945–1953\n\nIn the years following World War II, Ukrainian opera began to experience a period of gradual recovery. Composers such as Mykola Skorulskyy and Mykola Lyubchenko wrote new operas that were both critically and commercially successful. This period also saw the establishment of several new opera companies and the reconstruction of old opera houses.\n\n**1953–1991**\n\nIn the years following Stalin's death in 1953, Ukrainian opera experienced a period of significant growth and development. Composers such as Mykola Dmytrovych and Mykola Lyubchenko wrote new operas that reflected the country's changing cultural and social landscape. This period also saw the establishment of several new opera companies and the construction of new opera houses.\n\n### 1953–1970\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, Ukrainian opera continued to grow and develop. Composers such as Mykola Dmytrovych and Mykola Lyubchenko wrote new operas that reflected the country's changing cultural and social landscape. This period also saw the establishment of several new opera companies and the construction of new opera houses.\n\n### 1970s\n\nIn the 1970s, Ukrainian opera experienced a period of significant growth and development. Composers such as Mykola Dmytrovych and Mykola Lyubchenko wrote new operas that reflected the country's changing cultural and social landscape. This period also saw the establishment of several new opera companies and the construction of new opera houses.\n\n### 1980s\n\nIn the 1980s, Ukrainian opera continued to grow and develop. Composers such as Mykola Dmytrovych and Mykola Lyubchenko wrote new operas that reflected the country's changing cultural and social landscape. This period also saw the establishment of several new opera companies and the construction of new opera houses.\n\n**Post-independence operas**\n\nIn the years following Ukraine's independence in 1991, Ukrainian opera has continued to grow and develop. Composers such as Mykola Dmytrovych and Mykola Lyubchenko have written new operas that reflect the country's changing cultural and social landscape. This period has also seen the establishment of several new opera companies and the construction of new opera houses.\n\n**Opera houses**\n\nUkraine has several opera houses, including the National Opera of Ukraine, the Kyiv Opera House, and the Lviv Opera House. These opera houses have played an important role in the development and promotion of Ukrainian opera and have helped to establish the country's unique national style of opera.\n\n**References**\n\n* Notes\n* Citations\n* Sources\n\n**Further reading**\n\n* \n* \n* \n\n**External links**\n\n*", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The conflict has resulted in significant human suffering, widespread destruction, and a major humanitarian crisis.\n\nThe invasion was widely condemned by the international community, and has been characterized as an act of aggression and a breach of international law. The conflict has also led to a significant escalation of tensions between Russia and the West, and has had far-reaching consequences for global politics and international relations.\n\n**Prelude**\n\nThe tensions leading up to the invasion began in early 2022, when Russia began to amass troops along its border with Ukraine. The Kremlin claimed that this was in response to concerns about Ukrainian aggression, but many observers believed that it was a pretext for a planned invasion.\n\nIn January 2022, the United States and other Western countries imposed sanctions on several Russian officials and entities, in response to Russia's actions in Ukraine. Russia responded by expelling several diplomats from these countries and imposing its own sanctions on Western individuals and entities.\n\nOn February 21, 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin made a televised address in which he recognized the independence of the Donetsk and Luhansk people's republics, two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine that had been supported by Russia. This move was widely seen as a precursor to an invasion.\n\n**Initial invasion**\n\nOn February 24, 2022, at 5:00 AM local time, Russian forces launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine, with attacks reported in multiple regions across the country. The initial invasion was characterized by widespread artillery bombardments, airstrikes, and amphibious landings.\n\nRussian forces targeted major cities, including Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Odessa, as well as key infrastructure such as airports, roads, and bridges. The Ukrainian military responded with force, but was initially overwhelmed by the scale of the Russian invasion.\n\nIn the first few days of the invasion, Russian forces made significant gains, capturing key cities and infrastructure in eastern Ukraine. However, Ukrainian forces eventually regrouped and launched a series of counterattacks, which slowed the Russian advance.\n\n**Southeastern front**\n\nThe southeastern front of the conflict saw intense fighting in the Donbas region, where Ukrainian forces clashed with Russian-backed separatists. The city of Mariupol, a key port city in eastern Ukraine, was besieged by Russian forces, and was subjected to a prolonged and brutal siege.\n\nIn the early stages of the conflict, Russian forces made significant gains in the Donbas region, capturing several key cities and infrastructure. However, Ukrainian forces eventually launched a series of counterattacks, which pushed Russian forces back and established a defensive line.\n\n**2022 Ukrainian counteroffensives**\n\nIn June 2022, Ukrainian forces launched a series of counteroffensives against Russian forces in eastern Ukraine. The counteroffensives were characterized by a series of rapidly executed attacks, which caught Russian forces off guard and inflicted significant casualties.\n\nThe counteroffensives were successful in pushing Russian forces back and recapturing several key cities and infrastructure. However, the gains were ultimately reversed, and Russian forces regrouped and launched a series of counterattacks, which pushed Ukrainian forces back.\n\n**Second stalemate**\n\nThe conflict entered a second stalemate in the summer of 2022, as both sides dug in and prepared for a prolonged and brutal conflict. The stalemate was characterized by a series of limited skirmishes and artillery exchanges, as both sides sought to gain a strategic advantage.\n\nThe stalemate was marked by a significant escalation of the humanitarian crisis, as civilians were caught in the crossfire and infrastructure was severely damaged. The international community continued to condemn the conflict and call for a peaceful resolution.\n\n**2023 Ukrainian counteroffensive**\n\nIn 2023, Ukrainian forces launched a new counteroffensive against Russian forces, which was characterized by a series of rapid and decisive attacks. The counteroffensive was successful in pushing Russian forces back and recapturing several key cities and infrastructure.\n\nThe counteroffensive was marked by a significant improvement in Ukrainian military tactics and strategy, which allowed Ukrainian forces to gain a strategic advantage over Russian forces. The counteroffensive was also supported by significant international aid and assistance, which helped to bolster Ukrainian forces and enable them to achieve their objectives.\n\n**Second winter campaign**\n\nThe conflict entered a second winter campaign in 2023, as both sides continued to engage in limited skirmishes and artillery exchanges. The winter campaign was marked by a significant escalation of the humanitarian crisis, as civilians were caught in the crossfire and infrastructure was severely damaged.\n\nDespite the challenges, Ukrainian forces continued to push forward with their counteroffensives, which were successful in pushing Russian forces back and recapturing several key cities and infrastructure. The international community continued to condemn the conflict and call for a peaceful resolution.\n\n**See also**\n\n* List of Russian military units involved in the 2022 invasion of Ukraine\n* List of Ukrainian military units involved in the 2022 invasion of Ukraine\n* Russian-Ukrainian War\n* International response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine\n\n**References**\n\n* Note: This article does not include any citations or references.\n\n**External links**\n\n* Russian Ministry of Defence\n* Ukrainian Ministry of Defence\n* List of sources for the Russian-Ukrainian War", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The season began on August 14, 2021, and concluded on May 22, 2022. The season was marked by a fierce title race, significant managerial changes, and COVID-19 outbreaks that forced postponements.\n\n**The race for first place**\n\nThe 2021–22 Premier League season was characterized by a highly competitive title race, with several teams vying for the top spot throughout the season. Manchester City, led by manager Pep Guardiola, were the reigning champions, but Liverpool, Manchester United, and Chelsea were among the favorites to dethrone them. The season's early stages saw Liverpool and Manchester City engage in a fierce battle for top spot, with the two teams trading places at the top of the table. However, Manchester City eventually pulled away from the competition, accumulating a significant lead in the final weeks of the season.\n\n**Newcastle takeover**\n\nOne of the most significant stories of the 2021–22 Premier League season was the takeover of Newcastle United by a consortium led by the Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF). The takeover was completed in October 2021, and it marked a significant shift in the club's ownership structure. The new ownership group invested heavily in the club, signing several high-profile players and appointing a new management team. The takeover had a significant impact on the club's on-field performance, as Newcastle United's results improved significantly under their new ownership.\n\n**COVID-19 outbreaks force postponements**\n\nThe 2021–22 Premier League season was also marked by several COVID-19 outbreaks that forced postponements of matches. Several clubs, including Liverpool, Manchester United, and Chelsea, were forced to postpone matches due to outbreaks among their players and staff. The postponements had a significant impact on the league's schedule, with several matches being rescheduled for later in the season.\n\n**Abramovich sanctions**\n\nRoman Abramovich, the owner of Chelsea Football Club, was sanctioned by the UK government in March 2022 due to his alleged involvement in the invasion of Ukraine. The sanctions had a significant impact on the club, as Abramovich was forced to sell the club to a new ownership group. The sale was completed in May 2022, and it marked the end of Abramovich's 19-year tenure as Chelsea's owner.\n\n**Final day climax**\n\nThe 2021–22 Premier League season concluded on May 22, 2022, with a dramatic final-day climax. Manchester City sealed the title with a 3-2 win over Aston Villa, while Liverpool secured a 3-0 win over Wolves to finish second. The final-day results also had a significant impact on the relegation battle, as Burnley and Watford were relegated to the Championship.\n\n### Title\n\nManchester City won their fourth Premier League title in five seasons, accumulating 93 points from their 38 matches. Pep Guardiola's side dominated the league, winning 29 matches and losing just three. Erling Haaland was the club's top scorer, netting 35 goals in his debut season in the Premier League.\n\n### Relegation\n\nBurnley and Watford were relegated to the Championship, finishing 18th and 19th in the table, respectively. Norwich City finished 20th, but were relegated due to their lower goal difference compared to Everton, who finished 19th.\n\n### Champions League, Europa League and Conference League spots\n\nThe top four teams in the Premier League qualify for the Champions League, while the fifth-placed team qualifies for the Europa League. The sixth-placed team qualifies for the Europa League Conference League. Manchester City qualified for the Champions League as champions, while Liverpool and Chelsea qualified as runners-up and third-placed teams, respectively. Manchester United qualified for the Europa League, finishing fifth in the table.\n\n**Other teams**\n\nOther notable teams in the 2021–22 Premier League season included Tottenham Hotspur, who finished sixth and qualified for the Europa League Conference League, and Arsenal, who finished seventh and missed out on European qualification.\n\n**Teams**\n\n### Stadiums and locations\n\nThe 20 teams in

It was the sixth legislative election of the French Fifth Republic.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe election was held in the midst of a global economic crisis and a growing concern about climate change. The French government, led by President Emmanuel Macron, was seeking to maintain its majority in the National Assembly. The election was also seen as a test of Macron's popularity and the effectiveness of his policies.\n\nThe election was significant because it marked a change in the electoral system. For the first time, voters in each constituency would be able to choose between two candidates in the second round, rather than just one. This change was aimed at increasing voter turnout and making the electoral process more representative.\n\n**Electoral system**\n\nThe French electoral system is based on a proportional representation system, with three rounds of voting. In the first round, voters choose from a list of candidates in their constituency. The two candidates with the most votes in each constituency advance to the second round, where voters choose between them. The third round is only held in constituencies where no candidate receives a majority of the vote in the second round.\n\nIn the 2022 election, the electoral system was modified to include a \"dual-round\" system, where voters in each constituency choose between two candidates in the second round. This change was aimed at increasing voter turnout and making the electoral process more representative.\n\n**Dates**\n\nThe election was held on two dates: 12 and 19 June 2022. The first round was held on 12 June, and the second round was held on 19 June.\n\n**Major parties and alliances**\n\nSeveral major parties and alliances participated in the election. The largest party was the La République En Marche! (LREM) party, led by President Emmanuel Macron. The second-largest party was the Rassemblement National (RN) party, led by Marine Le Pen. Other major parties included the Socialist Party (PS), the Communist Party (PCF), and the Republican Party (LR).\n\n**Deputies not standing for reelection**\n\nSeveral deputies who were previously elected to the National Assembly did not stand for reelection in 2022. These included several prominent politicians, such as the former Prime Minister Manuel Valls and the former Interior Minister Christophe Castaner.\n\n**Opinion polls**\n\nOpinion polls were conducted throughout the election campaign to gauge voter sentiment and predict the outcome of the election. Several polls were conducted in the weeks leading up to the first round, with some showing the LREM party in a strong position and others showing the RN party gaining ground.\n\n**Results**\n\n### First round\n\nThe first round of the election was held on 12 June 2022. The results were as follows:\n\n| Party | Votes | Percentage |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| LREM | 6,579,118 | 25.7% |\n| RN | 4,148,275 | 16.1% |\n| PS | 2,371,808 | 9.2% |\n| PCF | 1,114,303 | 4.3% |\n| LR | 1,061,752 | 4.1% |\n\n### Second round\n\nThe second round of the election was held on 19 June 2022. The results were as follows:\n\n| Party | Votes | Percentage |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| LREM | 7,976,176 | 28.2% |\n| RN | 6,392,638 | 22.4% |\n| PS | 3,571,451 | 12.5% |\n| PCF | 1,334,322 | 4.7% |\n| LR | 1,263,419 | 4.5% |\n\n### National results\n\nThe national results of the election were as follows:\n\n| Party | Seats |\n| --- | --- |\n| LREM | 260 |\n| RN | 89 |\n| PS | 29 |\n| PCF | 15 |\n| LR | 61 |\n\n### Results by constituency\n\nThe results by constituency were as follows:\n\n| Constituency | Seats |\n| --- | --- |\n| Paris | 10 |\n| Lyon | 8 |\n| Marseille | 12 |\n| Bordeaux | 7 |\n| Toulouse | 7 |\n\n### Electorate\n\nThe electorate for the election was approximately 50.5 million people, with a turnout of around 47.5%. This was a decrease of around 2% compared to the previous election.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\n### Formation of parliamentary groups\n\nFollowing the election, the LREM party formed the majority in the National Assembly, with 260 seats. The RN party formed the second-largest group, with 89 seats. The PS, PCF, and LR parties also formed groups, although with fewer seats.\n\n### Vote of no confidence\n\nIn the weeks following the election, the National Assembly voted on several motions of no confidence against the government. These motions were largely symbolic, as the LREM party had a majority in the Assembly.\n\n**See also**\n\n* French legislative election\n* 2017 French legislative election\n* 2020 French legislative election\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The election was held in the midst of a global economic crisis and a growing concern about climate change.\n* The French electoral system was modified to include a \"dual-round\" system, where voters in each constituency choose between two candidates in the second round.\n* The election was significant because it marked a change in the electoral system and the return of the RN party to the National Assembly.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

Born on June 19, 1947, in Bombay, India, Rushdie has lived a life marked by literary innovation, controversy, and a commitment to free speech.\n\n**Early life and education**\n\nRushdie was born to a Muslim family of modest means in Bombay, India. His father, Anis Ahmed Rushdie, was a businessman, and his mother, Negin Bhatt, was a social worker. Rushdie has said that his family was not particularly devout, and he was not raised with a strong emphasis on Islamic tradition. He attended Cathedral and John Connon School in Bombay and later studied history at King's College, Cambridge, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1968.\n\n**Career**\n\nRushdie's literary career spans multiple genres and forms, including fiction, nonfiction, and drama.\n\n### **Copywriter**\n\nBefore becoming a full-time writer, Rushdie worked as a copywriter for the British advertising agency S. H. Benson and later for Ogilvy & Mather. During this period, he wrote numerous advertisements, including the famous \"Hamlet\" ad for Black Label whiskey.\n\n### **Literary works**\n\nRushdie's literary career can be divided into several distinct periods, each marked by a significant shift in style, tone, and thematic focus.\n\n#### **Early works and literary breakthrough, 1975–1987**\n\nRushdie's early works include \"Grimus\" (1975), a science fiction novel that explores the intersection of mythology and technology, and \"Midnight's Children\" (1981), a magical realist novel that tells the story of India's independence through the experiences of a young boy born at the stroke of midnight. The novel won the Booker Prize in 1981 and established Rushdie as a major literary talent.\n\n#### **The Satanic Verses and Haroun and the Sea of Stories, 1988–1990**\n\nThe Satanic Verses (1988) is a novel that explores the tensions between Islam and the West through the story of two Indian immigrants who become embroiled in a divine struggle between good and evil. The novel sparked widespread controversy and outrage, particularly in the Islamic world, and led to a fatwa being issued against Rushdie by Ayatollah Khomeini. Rushdie's subsequent novel, Haroun and the Sea of Stories (1990), is a children's book that explores the power of storytelling and the importance of preserving cultural heritage.\n\n#### **Further works, 1990s–2000s**\n\nRushdie's subsequent novels include \"The Moor's Last Sigh\" (1995), a novel that explores the intersection of Indian and European culture, and \"The Ground Beneath Her Feet\" (1999), a novel that reimagines the story of Orpheus and Eurydice in the context of modern-day India. Rushdie also published several collections of essays, including \"Imaginary Homelands\" (1991) and \"Step Across This Line\" (2002).\n\n#### **Later works, novels, and essays, 2015–2024**\n\nRushdie's more recent works include \"Joseph Anton\" (2012), a memoir that explores his experiences with the fatwa, and \"Two Years Eight Months and Twenty-Eight Nights\" (2015), a novel that reimagines the intersection of East and West through the story of a young Arab and a young European. Rushdie has also published several essays on topics ranging from Brexit to the rise of nationalism.\n\n**Critical reception**\n\nRushdie's work has been widely praised for its innovation, wit, and intellectual curiosity. Critics have praised his ability to blend different styles and genres, as well as his commitment to exploring the complexities of identity, culture, and politics. However, his work has also been criticized for its perceived irreverence towards Islamic tradition and its perceived elitism.\n\n**Academic and other activities**\n\nRushdie has taught at various universities, including Cornell University and Emory University, and has held several academic positions, including the chair of the Booker Prize. He has also been involved in various literary and cultural organizations, including the PEN American Center and the Writers' Guild of Great Britain.\n\n**Film and television**\n\nRushdie's work has been adapted into several films and television shows, including \"The Satanic Verses\", \"Midnight's Children\", and \"The Moor's Last Sigh\". He has also been involved in various film and television projects, including the production of a film adaptation of his novel \"The Ground Beneath Her Feet\".\n\n**The Satanic Verses and the fatwā**\n\nThe publication of \"The Satanic Verses\" sparked widespread controversy and outrage, particularly in the Islamic world. Ayatollah Khomeini issued a fatwa against Rushdie, calling for his death and labeling him an apostate. The fatwa led to a series of events, including the failed assassination attempt on Rushdie in 1989 and the subsequent attacks on his publishers and supporters.\n\n### **Failed assassination attempt (1989)**\n\nOn February 14, 1989, Rushdie was the target of a failed assassination attempt by a group of Muslim extremists. The group, which included several members of the Iranian government, had been planning the attack for several months. The attempt was foiled when the would-be assassins were unable to find Rushdie, who had been staying in hiding.\n\n#### **Hezbollah's comments (2006)**\n\nIn 2006, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah called for Rushdie's death, labeling him a \"Zionist agent\" and an \"apostate\". The comments sparked renewed controversy and outrage, particularly in the Middle East.\n\n### **International Guerillas (1990)**\n\nIn 1990, a group of international Islamist guerrillas, including members of Hezbollah and Hamas, launched a series of attacks on Rushdie's publishers and supporters. The attacks, which included bombings and shootings, were aimed at silenc", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The new map was challenged by several groups, including the League of Women Voters and the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, who argued that it still engaged in racial gerrymandering.

The suspensions were met with strong reactions from the affected communities, as well as from other commentators and experts. This article provides an overview of the events leading up to the suspensions, the policy changes implemented by Twitter, and the responses from various stakeholders.\n\n**#Background**\n\nTwitter, a social media platform founded in 2006, has undergone significant changes since Elon Musk's acquisition in October 2022. Musk, a prolific user of Twitter, has been vocal about his plans to revamp the platform's moderation policies and increase transparency. However, his approach has been met with criticism from various quarters, including users, journalists, and experts.\n\n**#Account suspensions**\n\nThe December 2022 suspensions were a culmination of several policy changes implemented by Twitter. Some of the key changes include:\n\n##**Twitter policy changes**\n\nTwitter's policy changes aimed to reduce the prevalence of harassment and spam on the platform. However, the implementation of these changes led to the suspension of numerous accounts, including those of journalists, flight-tracking services, and other users. The policy changes included:\n\n*   The introduction of a \"legacy\" label for high-profile accounts, which some users saw as an attempt to demonetize these accounts.\n*   The enforcement of stricter moderation policies, particularly with regards to hate speech and harassment.\n*   The implementation of a new algorithm that prioritized content from accounts that were deemed \"authentic\" and \"trustworthy.\"\n\n##**Suspension of flight-tracking accounts**\n\nOne of the most notable suspensions was that of flight-tracking services, including @FlightRadar24 and @planefinder. These accounts provided real-time updates on flight schedules, delays, and cancellations, and were widely used by travelers and aviation enthusiasts. The suspensions were met with criticism from the affected communities, who saw the accounts as a valuable resource.\n\n##**Suspension of journalist accounts**\n\nSeveral journalist accounts were also suspended, including those of prominent journalists such as Glenn Greenwald and Matt Taibbi. The suspensions were met with criticism from the journalism community, who saw the accounts as an essential tool for reporting on news and current events.\n\n##**Explanation from Twitter and Musk**\n\nTwitter and Musk defended the suspensions as necessary measures to reduce harassment and spam on the platform. In a statement, Musk said that the suspensions were part of a broader effort to \"make Twitter a more positive and inclusive place.\" However, many users saw the suspensions as an attempt to silence dissenting voices and stifle free speech.\n\n**#Reinstatement of some accounts**\n\nIn response to the backlash, Twitter reinstated some of the suspended accounts, including those of flight-tracking services and journalists. However, the reinstatements were not universal, and many users continued to express concern about the platform's moderation policies and the potential for future suspensions.\n\n**#Responses**\n\nThe suspensions sparked a wide range of responses from various stakeholders, including:\n\n##**Suspended journalists**\n\nSeveral journalists who were suspended spoke out about the experience, highlighting the importance of free speech and the need for robust moderation policies. Glenn Greenwald, for example, wrote a scathing op-ed about the suspensions, arguing that they represented a \"clear and present danger\" to the free press.\n\n##**Other commentators**\n\nOther commentators, including experts and users, weighed in on the suspensions, offering a range of perspectives on the issue. Some saw the suspensions as a necessary measure to reduce harassment and spam, while others saw them as an overreach of Twitter's moderation powers.\n\n**#See also**\n\n*   Twitter's moderation policies\n*   Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter\n*   Free speech and social media platforms\n*   Harassment and spam on social media platforms", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

This process has been ongoing for over six decades, with the goal of creating a more peaceful, prosperous, and integrated Europe.\n\n**History**\n\nThe concept of European integration dates back to the aftermath of World War II, when European leaders sought to prevent future conflicts by creating a more cooperative and integrated Europe. The first step towards integration was the creation of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) in 1951, which brought together six European countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands) to manage their coal and steel industries.\n\nIn the 1960s, the ECSC was expanded to create the European Economic Community (EEC), which established a common market among its member states. The EEC was later renamed the European Community (EC) in 1993, and then merged with other European institutions to form the European Union (EU) in 1999.\n\n**Theories of Integration**\n\nThere are several theories of integration that have helped to shape the European integration process. These include:\n\n### **Proto-integration period**\n\nDuring the proto-integration period, European countries began to cooperate on specific issues, such as economic policy and defense.

This phase was characterized by a focus on economic integration and the creation of a single market.\n\n### **Second phase: analyzing governance, 1980s onwards**\n\nThe second phase of integration saw a focus on governance and the development of new institutions, such as the European Monetary Institute (EMI) and the European Central Bank (ECB). This phase was characterized by a focus on economic and monetary union.\n\n### **Third phase: constructing the EU, 1990s onwards**\n\nThe third phase of integration saw the creation of the EU as we know it today. This phase was characterized by a focus on a single currency, the euro, and the creation of a single market.\n\n**Citizens' organisations calling for further integration**\n\nThere are several citizens' organizations that have called for further integration, including the European Citizens' Initiative (ECI) and the Committee for a People's Europe (CPE).\n\n**Overlap of membership in various agreements**\n\nMany European countries are members of multiple agreements, including:\n\n### **Common membership of member states of the European Union**\n\nAll EU member states are also members of the European Economic Area (EEA) and the Schengen Agreement.\n\n### **Most integrated countries**\n\nThe most integrated countries in Europe are those that are members of the EU, the EEA, and the Schengen Agreement.
