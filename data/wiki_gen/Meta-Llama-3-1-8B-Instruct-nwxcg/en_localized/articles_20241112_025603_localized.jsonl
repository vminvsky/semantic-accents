The project has been implemented multiple times, with the most notable instances being in 2017, 2022, and 2023.\n\n**Introduction**\nR/place is a unique online experience that showcases the collaborative potential of social media platforms. By allowing users to contribute to a shared canvas, the project creates a dynamic and ever-changing artwork that reflects the collective creativity of its participants. This article provides an overview of the history and development of R/place, as well as its media response and cultural significance.\n\n**History**\n\n### 2017 Experiment\nThe first R/place experiment took place in 2017 as a side project by the developers of the social media platform, Twitter. The project was designed to be a simple collaborative drawing experience, where users could contribute to a shared canvas by changing individual pixels. The canvas was a 1,000x1,000 pixel grid, and users could change the color of a single pixel by posting a specific tweet. The project was launched without any prior announcement, and it quickly gained popularity among Twitter users.\n\nThe 2017 experiment was notable for its chaotic and unpredictable nature. As users contributed to the canvas, it quickly became a chaotic mess of colors and patterns. The project was also prone to vandalism, with some users intentionally changing pixels to create disturbing or off-putting images. Despite the chaos, the 2017 experiment was widely covered by media outlets and online communities, and it marked the beginning of R/place as a cultural phenomenon.\n\n### 2022 Experiment\nThe second R/place experiment took place in 2022, several years after the initial experiment. The project was revamped and updated, with a new 5,000x5,000 pixel canvas and a more robust moderation system. The 2022 experiment was notable for its increased popularity and engagement, with millions of users contributing to the canvas over the course of several days.\n\nThe 2022 experiment was also notable for its more organized and collaborative nature. Users formed groups and worked together to create complex and intricate designs, including murals, mosaics, and other forms of collaborative art. The project was also more focused on community-building and social interaction, with users engaging in discussions and debates about the art and the project itself.\n\n### 2023 Experiment\nThe third R/place experiment took place in 2023, and it marked a significant departure from the previous two experiments. The project was updated with a new 10,000x10,000 pixel canvas and a more advanced moderation system. The 2023 experiment was notable for its increased emphasis on community engagement and social interaction, with users able to participate in live events and discussions.\n\nThe 2023 experiment was also notable for its more experimental and avant-garde nature. Users were encouraged to push the boundaries of traditional art and creativity, and the project featured a wide range of unusual and innovative designs.

Pictures. The film is based on the DC Comics character of the same name and serves as a reboot of the Batman film series. The movie follows the story of a younger Bruce Wayne, played by Robert Pattinson, as he becomes the vigilante known as Batman to fight crime in Gotham City.\n\nPlot\n--------\n\nThe film begins with a narrative device where the audience is presented with a series of flashbacks and visions of the past, which eventually lead to the present day. In the present, Gotham City is plagued by corruption and crime, and the police department is ineffective in dealing with it. Bruce Wayne, a billionaire philanthropist, returns to his hometown after a long absence to attend a charity gala at the Gotham City Opera House. However, the event is disrupted by the Riddler (Paul Dano), a serial killer who is using puzzles and riddles to commit murders and taunt the police.\n\nAs the investigation into the Riddler's crimes unfolds, Bruce becomes increasingly obsessed with uncovering his identity and motives. He adopts the persona of Batman, using his skills and resources to track down the Riddler and bring him to justice. Along the way, he encounters Selina Kyle (Zoë Kravitz), a cat burglar who becomes embroiled in his investigation, and Alfred Pennyworth (Andy Serkis), his loyal butler and confidant.\n\nCast\n-----\n\n* Robert Pattinson as Bruce Wayne/Batman\n* Zoë Kravitz as Selina Kyle/Catwoman\n* Paul Dano as Edward Nashton/The Riddler\n* Jeffrey Wright as James Gordon\n* John Turturro as Carmine Falcone\n* Peter Sarsgaard as Gil Colson\n* Jayme Lawson as Bella Reál\n* Andy Serkis as Alfred Pennyworth\n\nProduction\n----------\n\n### Development\n\nThe idea for a new Batman film was first proposed by Warner Bros. in 2015, with Ben Affleck set to direct and star in the movie.

The team decides to use Scott's Quantum Realm experience to their advantage, hoping to find a way to rescue Janet, who has been trapped in the Quantum Realm since the events of Ant-Man.\n\nAs the team navigates the Quantum Realm, they encounter a being known as Kang the Conqueror, a powerful and ruthless individual from the future who has been manipulating events in the Quantum Realm to suit his own purposes. Kang is determined to conquer the multiverse, and Scott and his team must stop him before it's too late.\n\n# Cast\n\n* Paul Rudd as Scott Lang / Ant-Man\n* Evangeline Lilly as Hope van Dyne / Wasp\n* Michael Douglas as Hank Pym\n* Michelle Pfeiffer as Janet van Dyne\n* Kathryn Newton as Cassie Lang\n* Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conqueror\n* David Dastmalchian as Veb\n* Katy O'Brian as Jota\n* William Jackson Harper as Quantonium\n* Bill Murray as Lord Krylar\n\n# Production\n\n## Development\n\nThe film was first announced in 2019, with Scott Lang's next adventure being a key part of Marvel Studios' Phases 4 and 5.

Peyton Reed, director of the first two Ant-Man films, returned to direct the third installment.\n\n## Pre-production\n\nPre-production for the film began in 2020, with the cast and crew working remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The film's script was rewritten several times, with the story undergoing significant changes to accommodate the introduction of Kang the Conqueror. The film's visual effects were also a major focus, with the team using a combination of practical and CGI effects to bring the Quantum Realm to life.\n\n## Filming\n\nPrincipal photography for the film began in February 2021 and wrapped in October 2021. The film was shot on location in Atlanta, Georgia, and at Pinewood Atlanta Studios. The cast and crew worked tirelessly to complete the film, often working 12-hour days to meet the tight production schedule.\n\n## Post-production\n\nPost-production for the film was a long and arduous process, with the team working to complete the film's visual effects and sound design. The film's score was composed by Ludwig Göransson, who incorporated a mix of electronic and orchestral elements to create a unique sound.\n\n# Music\n\nThe film's score was composed by Ludwig Göransson, who incorporated a mix of electronic and orchestral elements to create a unique sound. The score features a haunting and atmospheric quality, perfectly capturing the sense of wonder and unease that pervades the Quantum Realm. The soundtrack also features several songs, including a rendition of the classic tune \"The Entertainer\".\n\n# Marketing\n\nMarketing for the film began in 2022, with Marvel Studios releasing a series of trailers and teasers that showcased the film's action-packed visuals and introduced the villainous Kang the Conqueror.

The protest gained widespread attention and drew international scrutiny, sparking debates about freedom of assembly, public health measures, and the role of government in responding to social unrest.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Protest goals\n\nThe primary goals of the protests were to challenge the Canadian government's COVID-19 vaccination policies, including mandatory vaccination requirements for certain professions and the implementation of a vaccine passport system. Protesters also sought to raise awareness about the perceived erosion of civil liberties and the perceived overreach of government authority in response to the pandemic.\n\n### Initial events and the start of the protest\n\nThe protests began in late January 2022, when a group of truckers and their supporters converged on Ottawa, the nation's capital, in a convoy of trucks and other vehicles.

Born on August 25, 1949, in Oxford, England, Amis has established himself as a leading figure in contemporary literature.\n\nEarly life\n\nMartin Amis was born to Kingsley Amis, a renowned novelist, and Hilary Bardwell. His father's literary success and his own early exposure to writing had a significant impact on his development as a writer. Amis was raised in a family that valued literature and learning, and he has credited his father's influence with helping him to develop his writing skills.\n\nEarly writing\n\nAmis's writing career began in the 1970s, with the publication of his first novel, _The Rachel Papers_, in 1973. This debut novel explored themes of identity, morality, and the complexities of human relationships. Amis's work during this period was characterized by its intellectualism, experimentation, and often provocative subject matter.\n\nMain career\n\n### 1980s and 1990s\n\nIn the 1980s, Amis continued to establish himself as a major literary force with the publication of novels such as _Dead Babies_ (1986) and _Money_ (1984). _Money_ is often cited as one of Amis's best works, and its exploration of the Thatcherite era's excesses and decay resonated with readers. The novel's satire and critique of the effects of capitalism on individual relationships and society remain relevant today.\n\n### 2000s\n\nThe 2000s saw Amis continue to push the boundaries of his writing style and subject matter. Novels such as _The Experience_ (2000) and _Night Train_ (1997) showcased his ability to experiment with form and narrative structure. _The Experience_ explored the nature of reality and the human experience, while _Night Train_ delved into the complexities of human relationships and the effects of trauma.\n\n### 2010s and 2020s\n\nIn the 2010s, Amis continued to write novels that were both critically acclaimed and commercially successful. _The Zone of Interest_ (2014) and _Inside Story_ (2018) showcased his ability to tackle complex and often difficult subjects with nuance and sensitivity. _The Zone of Interest_ explored the themes of the Holocaust and the nature of evil, while _Inside Story_ delved into the complexities of human relationships and the effects of trauma.\n\n### Other work\n\n#### University of Manchester\n\nIn addition to his literary career, Amis has also been involved in academic pursuits. In 2007, he was appointed as the first professor of creative writing at the University of Manchester. During his tenure, he established the Manchester Writing School and oversaw the development of the university's creative writing program.\n\nPersonal life\n\nAmis was married to Antonia Phillips from 1983 to 1995, and then to Isabel Fonseca from 1996 to 2018. He has two children, Jacob and Louisa. In 2018, Amis announced that he would be separating from his wife, and the couple divorced soon after.\n\n### Death\n\nMartin Amis passed away on August 17, 2023, at the age of 73, after a long battle with cancer.\n\nViews\n\nAmis's views on a range of subjects are reflected in his writing. He has been known to be provocative and contrarian, often challenging readers to think critically about the world around them.\n\n#### Writing\n\nAmis has written extensively on the craft of writing and the role of the writer in society. He has argued that the writer's primary responsibility is to tell the truth, even if it is uncomfortable or difficult.\n\n#### Nuclear proliferation\n\nAmis has been a vocal critic of nuclear proliferation and the dangers of the nuclear age. In his novel _The Zone of Interest_, he explores the themes of the Holocaust and the nature of evil, and argues that the Holocaust was a preventable tragedy.\n\n#### Geopolitics\n\nAmis has written extensively on geopolitics and the complexities of international relations. He has argued that the global system is inherently unstable and that the rise of nationalist and populist movements poses a significant threat to global stability.\n\n#### Electoral politics\n\nAmis has been critical of electoral politics and the way in which politicians often use rhetoric and spin to manipulate public opinion. In his novel _The Zone of Interest_, he explores the ways in which politicians use language to create a false narrative and distract from the truth.\n\n#### Islam and Islamism\n\nAmis has written extensively on the topics of Islam and Islamism, and has argued that the rise of Islamist movements poses a significant threat to global stability. In his novel _The Zone of Interest_, he explores the complexities of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the ways in which Islamist ideologies have been used to justify violence and terrorism.\n\n#### Euthanasia\n\nAmis has written extensively on the topic of euthanasia and the ethics of assisted dying. In his novel _The Experience_, he explores the themes of mortality and the meaning of life, and argues that individuals have the right to choose their own fate.\n\n#### Agnosticism\n\nAmis has identified as an agnostic and has written extensively on the nature of faith and the role of religion in society. In his novel _The Zone of Interest_, he explores the complexities of faith and the ways in which it can be used to justify violence and oppression.\n\nBibliography\n\n### Novels\n\n* _The Rachel Papers_ (1973)\n* _Dead Babies_ (1986)\n* _Money_ (1984)\n* _London Fields_ (1989)\n* _The Experience_ (2000)\n* _Night Train_ (1997)\n* _The Zone of Interest_ (2014)\n* _Inside Story_ (2018)\n\n### Short fiction\n\n* _A General in the Army Now_ (1990)\n* _Obbligato_ (1990)\n* _The Russia House_ (1989)\n* _The Moronic Inferno_ (1989)\n\n### Non-fiction\n\n* _Visiting Mrs. Nabokov_ (1993)\n* _The Moronic Inferno and Other Visits_ (1986)\n* _Experience_ (2000)\n\n### Screenplays\n\n* _The Russia House_ (1990)\n\nNotes\n\nThis article is based on a comprehensive review of Martin Amis's life and work.

Born on January 8, 1947, in Phoenix, Arizona, Bonin's life was marked by a series of violent crimes that would ultimately lead to his execution.\n\nEarly life\n\nChildhood\n Bonin was the youngest of five children born to William George Bonin Sr. and his wife, Mary Ellen. His family moved frequently during his childhood, living in various towns in Arizona and California. Bonin's parents divorced when he was eight years old, and he was sent to live with his grandparents in Fullerton, California. He attended Fullerton Union High School, where he was described as a quiet and reserved student.\n\n Adolescence\n Bonin's teenage years were marked by behavioral problems and run-ins with the law. He was arrested multiple times for petty crimes, including theft and vandalism. At the age of 16, Bonin dropped out of high school and began working as a mechanic. He enlisted in the United States Air Force in 1965, but was discharged in 1967 due to disciplinary problems.\n\n Engagement and U.S. Air Force\n Bonin met his first wife, Teresa Ehrlich, in the Air Force. They married in 1966, but the relationship was tumultuous, with Bonin frequently engaging in infidelity and violence. He was court-martialed twice for fighting with his fellow airmen and was eventually discharged from the Air Force.\n\nFirst convictions\n Bonin's first conviction came in 1967, when he was arrested for possession of a concealed firearm. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 60 days in jail. In 1969, Bonin was arrested for assault and battery, and was sentenced to six months in jail.\n\nIncarceration at Atascadero and Vacaville prison\n Bonin was sent to the Atascadero State Hospital in 1969, where he was diagnosed with a \"personality disorder\" and treated for several months. He was later transferred to the California Men's Colony at Vacaville, where he spent several years in solitary confinement. During this time, Bonin's behavior became increasingly erratic, and he was frequently disciplined for violent outbursts.\n\nFurther offenses and imprisonment\n Bonin's behavior did not improve during his time at Vacaville. He was arrested multiple times for fighting with his fellow inmates, and was eventually transferred to the maximum-security prison at San Quentin. In 1977, Bonin was paroled and released from prison.\n\nRelease\n After his release from prison, Bonin returned to his family's home in Fullerton. He quickly became restless, and began to engage in a series of minor crimes, including theft and vandalism. It was during this time that Bonin met Vernon Butts, a fellow sex offender who would become his accomplice in several murders.\n\nAcquaintance with Vernon Butts and Gregory Miley\n Bonin met Vernon Butts through a mutual acquaintance, an", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The shortage was caused by a combination of factors, including supply chain issues, recall and plant shutdown, import restrictions, and market concentration.\n\nCauses\n\n### Supply chain issues\n\nThe infant formula shortage was exacerbated by supply chain issues, which were caused by a combination of factors, including COVID-19 pandemic-related disruptions, transportation delays, and labor shortages. The supply chain issues led to a shortage of raw materials, such as milk and other nutrients, which are used to manufacture infant formula.\n\n### Recall and plant shutdown\n\nIn February 2022, Abbott Nutrition, a leading manufacturer of infant formula, announced a voluntary recall of its Similac, Alimentum, and EleCare products due to concerns over bacterial contamination. The recall led to a shutdown of Abbott's Sturgis, Michigan plant, which is one of the largest infant formula manufacturing facilities in the United States. The shutdown had a significant impact on the supply of infant formula, as the plant produces a significant portion of the country's infant formula.\n\n#### Alleged problems at Sturgis plant\n\nInvestigations into the Sturgis plant revealed alleged problems with the facility's safety and quality control procedures. The plant had a history of issues with bacterial contamination, including Cronobacter sakazakii, which is a bacterium that can cause serious illness in infants. The allegations of problems at the Sturgis plant contributed to the shortage of infant formula and raised concerns about the safety of infant formula in the United States.\n\n### Import restrictions\n\nThe United States imposed import restrictions on infant formula from other countries, including Mexico and Ireland, due to concerns over the safety and quality of these products. The restrictions led to a shortage of infant formula in the United States, as imports from these countries were a significant source of supply.\n\n### Market concentration\n\nThe infant formula market in the United States is highly concentrated, with a few large manufacturers dominating the market. The concentration of the market made it difficult for other manufacturers to increase production to meet the demand for infant formula, exacerbating the shortage.\n\nEffects\n\n### Sale and donation of breast milk\n\nThe infant formula shortage led to an increase in the sale and donation of breast milk. Many mothers turned to selling their breast milk online or through local milk banks, while others donated their breast milk to hospitals and other organizations. The sale and donation of breast milk helped to alleviate the shortage of infant formula, but also raised concerns about the safety and quality of breast milk sold online.\n\n### Use of alternative foods\n\nThe infant formula shortage led to an increase in the use of alternative foods, such as cow's milk and soy milk, as substitutes for infant formula. While these alternatives can be used in a pinch, they are not nutritionally equivalent to infant formula and can pose health risks to infants.\n\n### Hospitalizations\n\nThe infant formula shortage led to an increase in hospitalizations of infants due to formula-related illnesses. Some infants were hospitalized for dehydration and other complications related to the lack of access to safe and nutritious infant formula.\n\n### Bot usage\n\nThe infant formula shortage also led to an increase in bot usage, as online retailers and manufacturers used automated systems to sell out of infant formula and other baby supplies.\n\n### Shortage in Canada\n\nThe infant formula shortage affected not only the United States but also Canada, where many manufacturers rely on the same suppliers and logistics as American manufacturers. The shortage in Canada led to a significant increase in prices and a shortage of infant formula in many provinces.\n\nResponses\n\n### Efforts to prevent price gouging\n\nThe U.S. government and other organizations implemented efforts to prevent price gouging of infant formula and other baby supplies. These efforts included monitoring prices and enforcing laws against price gouging.\n\n### Efforts to increase supply\n\nManufacturers and distributors of infant formula implemented efforts to increase the supply of infant formula, including increasing production and shipping infant formula from other countries.\n\n### Efforts to restore production\n\nAbbott Nutrition and other manufacturers implemented efforts to restore production at their plants, including implementing new safety and quality control procedures.\n\n### Investigations\n\n#### Congressional investigation\n\nThe U.S. Congress launched an investigation into the infant formula shortage and the role of manufacturers, distributors, and regulators in the shortage.\n\n#### FDA investigation\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) launched an investigation into the safety and quality of infant formula, including the allegations of bacterial contamination at the Sturgis plant.\n\n#### ABC News investigation\n\nABC News conducted an investigation into the infant formula shortage and the safety and quality of infant formula, including an in-depth look at the Sturgis plant.\n\n#### DOJ investigation\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) launched an investigation into price gouging and other alleged antitrust activities related to the infant formula shortage.\n\nCommentary\n\n### Breast milk vs. formula debate\n\nThe infant formula shortage raised questions about the safety and quality of breast milk sold online and the effectiveness of breast milk as a substitute for infant formula. Some argued that breast milk is a safer and more nutritious option, while others argued that it is not feasible for all mothers to breastfeed.\n\n### Criticism of federal response\n\nSome criticized the federal response to the infant formula shortage, arguing that it was too slow and ineffective in addressing the crisis. Others argued that the response was adequate, given the complex and multifaceted nature of the shortage.\n\n#### White House response\n\nThe White House issued a statement responding to the infant formula shortage, emphasizing the importance of ensuring the safety and quality of infant formula and providing support to manufacturers and distributors.\n\n#### Formula availability at the Southern border\n\nThe infant formula shortage also raised concerns about the availability of infant formula at the Southern border, where many families rely on formula as their primary source of nutrition for infants.\n\nSee also\n\n* List of formula recalls\n* Infant formula safety\n* Breastfeeding\n* Baby food industry\n\nThis article uses material from Wikipedia's article on the 2022 United States infant formula shortage, which is released under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share-Alike License 3.0 (CC-BY-SA).", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

His swimming career spanned several decades, with a notable decline in the latter part of his career.\n\nEarly Swimming Achievements\n\nYoung's early life and swimming career are not well-documented, but it is known that he was a strong swimmer from a young age. He began training in the Catalina Channel, off the coast of California, under the guidance of experienced coaches and swimmers.\n\nCatalina Swim Training\n\nYoung's training in the Catalina Channel was rigorous and designed to prepare him for long-distance swims. The channel's unique conditions, including strong currents and cold water temperatures, made it an ideal location for training swimmers who aimed to tackle challenging swims. Young was among the first swimmers to recognize the value of training in the Catalina Channel, and he spent many hours honing his skills in the waters off the California coast.\n\nCatalina Channel Swim\n\nYoung's first notable swim in the Catalina Channel was in 1922, when he swam from Catalina Island to the mainland. The swim was a significant achievement, as it required Young to navigate the channel's treacherous currents and waters. Young's swim was notable for being one of the first recorded swims in the channel, and it set the stage for his future long-distance swimming feats.\n\nSwam with Tides\n\nYoung's swim in the Catalina Channel was notable not only for its distance but also for the fact that he swam with the tides. The tides in the channel can be unpredictable and challenging for swimmers, but Young successfully navigated the currents and completed his swim. This achievement demonstrated Young's skill and endurance as a long-distance swimmer.\n\nCompetition from Norman Ross\n\nYoung's swims in the Catalina Channel were not without competition. Norman Ross, another experienced swimmer, had also been training in the channel and had been making gains in his own swimming career. Young and Ross were rival swimmers, and their competitions pushed each other to achieve greater distances and times. Their rivalry added to the excitement and challenge of swimming in the Catalina Channel.\n\nPublic Acclaim, with Limited Financial Gain\n\nYoung's swims in the Catalina Channel received widespread public acclaim, with many newspapers and magazines covering his achievements. However, despite his fame, Young struggled to make a living from his swimming career. He received limited financial compensation for his swims, and he relied on sponsorship and donations to support himself. This was a common issue for many long-distance swimmers in the 1920s and 1930s, who often had to rely on the generosity of others to continue their swimming careers.\n\nInconsistent Swimming Career\n\nYoung's swimming career was marked by periods of intense activity followed by periods of inactivity. This inconsistency made it challenging for him to maintain a high level of fitness and to continue making progress in his swimming career.\n\n1927, 21-Mile Lake Ontario Swim\n\nIn 1927, Young swam 21 miles across Lake Ontario, a significant feat that required him to navigate the lake's strong currents and winds. The swim was a notable achievement, but it was also a challenging and demanding event that pushed Young to his limits.\n\n1928, 15-Mile Lake Ontario Swim\n\nIn 1928, Young swam 15 miles across Lake Ontario, a distance that was considered impressive at the time. The swim was notable for its speed, as Young completed the distance in a relatively short time.\n\nWins Sept 1928 Montreal to Repentigney Marathon\n\nIn September 1928, Young won the Montreal to Repentigney Marathon, a challenging swim that required him to navigate the waters of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The swim was a notable achievement, as it demonstrated Young's skill and endurance as a long-distance swimmer.\n\n1929, 15-mile Lake Ontario swim\n\nIn 1929, Young swam 15 miles across Lake Ontario, a distance that was considered impressive at the time. The swim was notable for its speed, as Young completed the distance in a relatively short time.\n\n1930, 15-mile Lake Ontario swim\n\nIn 1930, Young swam 15 miles across Lake Ontario, a distance that was considered impressive at the time. The swim was notable for its speed, as Young completed the distance in a relatively short time.\n\nWins 1931 Lake Ontario win\n\nIn 1931, Young won the Lake Ontario swim, a challenging event that required him to navigate the lake's strong currents and winds. The swim was a notable achievement, as it demonstrated Young's skill and endurance as a long-distance swimmer.\n\nLate Swim Career\n\nYoung's swimming career declined in the latter part of the 1930s, as he struggled to continue making progress in his swimming career. He faced stiff competition from younger swimmers, and he found it challenging to maintain a high level of fitness.\n\nSwim Retirement and Marriage\n\nYoung retired from swimming in the 1940s, after a long and successful career. He married a woman named Dorothy, and the couple had two children together. Young's marriage and family life were happy and fulfilling, and he was able to settle into a quiet life after his retirement from swimming.\n\nMarriages\n\nYoung was married twice, first to a woman named Margaret and then to Dorothy. His marriage to Margaret ended in divorce, but his marriage to Dorothy was a long and happy one.\n\nLate Professional Life\n\nAfter his retirement from swimming, Young worked as a coach and instructor, helping young swimmers to develop their skills and achieve their goals. He was a respected figure in the swimming community, and he continued to be involved in the sport until his death.\n\nHonors\n\nYoung was awarded several honors and accolades for his achievements in swimming, including a place in the swimming hall of fame. He was recognized as one of the greatest long-distance swimmers of all time, and his achievements continue to inspire swimmers today.\n\nSee also\n\n* Swimming\n* Long-distance swimming\n* Catalina Channel\n* Lake Ontario\n* Montreal to Repentigney Marathon\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n* George Young at the International Swimming Hall of Fame", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The film is based on the true story of a bear that ingested a large quantity of cocaine in 1985.\n\nIntroduction\n------------\n\nIn the early 1980s, the United States was in the midst of a cocaine epidemic. The drug was widely available and its use was on the rise. In the midst of this chaos, a black bear in the woods of Georgia ingested a large quantity of cocaine, leading to its untimely death. The story of the bear's demise would go on to become a cautionary tale about the dangers of cocaine and the power of nature to reclaim what has been lost. The film Cocaine Bear brings this story to life in a unique and entertaining way.\n\nPlot\n-----\n\nThe film Cocaine Bear tells the story of a black bear that ingests a large quantity of cocaine in 1985. The bear, which has been nicknamed \"Cocaine Bear,\" is a massive animal that has been living in the woods of Georgia. The bear's life is turned upside down when it stumbles upon a large quantity of cocaine that has been dumped in the woods by a group of drug dealers.\n\nAs the bear ingests the cocaine, it becomes increasingly agitated and aggressive. The bear begins to roam the woods, causing chaos and destruction wherever it goes. The bear's behavior becomes more and more erratic, leading to a series of tragic events that ultimately result in its death.\n\nCast\n-----\n\nThe film Cocaine Bear features a talented cast of actors, including Keri Russell, Margo Martindale, Ray Liotta, and Christian Convery.

The deal was first announced in April 2022, but faced numerous challenges and setbacks along the way.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nTwitter is a social media platform with over 440 million monthly active users, making it one of the most widely used platforms for real-time communication and news dissemination. As a major player in the tech industry, Twitter's acquisition by Musk has significant implications for the company's future direction, user experience, and the broader social media landscape.\n\n**Prelude**\n\n### Background\n\nTwitter was founded in 2006 by Jack Dorsey, Evan Williams, Biz Stone, and Noah Glass. The platform quickly gained popularity for its 280-character limit, hashtags, and real-time updates. Over the years, Twitter has expanded its features to include live streaming, polls, and video sharing.\n\n### Early developments\n\nIn the years leading up to Musk's acquisition bid, Twitter faced increasing pressure from investors to improve its financial performance. The company's user growth had slowed, and its advertising revenue was under pressure from competitors like Facebook and Instagram. In 2020, Twitter's CEO Jack Dorsey announced a plan to increase revenue through improved advertising targeting and new features.\n\n**Buyout offer**\n\nOn April 4, 2022, Elon Musk, the CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, announced that he had acquired a 9.2% stake in Twitter, making him the company's largest shareholder. Musk stated that he believed Twitter had significant untapped potential and that he would work with the company to improve its features and increase its user base.\n\n### Takeover bid\n\nOn April 14, 2022, Musk made a formal takeover bid for Twitter, offering to buy the company for $44 billion. The bid was conditional on several factors, including the removal of Twitter's CEO Jack Dorsey, the appointment of a new CEO, and the implementation of new content moderation policies.\n\n### Acquisition announcement\n\nOn April 25, 2022, Twitter announced that it had accepted Musk's takeover bid. The deal was expected to close in the coming months, subject to regulatory approvals.\n\n**Attempted termination**\n\nHowever, on July 8, 2022, Musk announced that he was terminating his takeover bid, citing concerns over Twitter's user growth and the prevalence of spam and fake accounts on the platform.\n\n### Alleged hold\n\nMusk claimed that Twitter was not providing him with adequate information about its user base, and that the company was not being transparent about its content moderation policies. Twitter responded that it had provided Musk with all the necessary information and that it was committed to transparency.\n\n### Attempted withdrawal by Musk\n\nOn July 12, 2022, Musk attempted to withdraw from the deal, citing the same concerns that had led him to terminate the bid. Twitter responded by filing a lawsuit against Musk, seeking to enforce the terms of the original agreement.\n\n**Revival and closing**\n\nOn July 21, 2022, Musk announced that he would revive his takeover bid, subject to certain conditions. Twitter agreed to provide Musk with additional information about its user base and to implement new content moderation policies.\n\n### Revitalization of bid\n\nOn July 27, 2022, Musk formally revived his takeover bid, offering to buy Twitter for $54.20 per share. The deal was expected to close in the coming months, subject to regulatory approvals.\n\n### Completion of purchase\n\nOn October 27, 2022, Twitter announced that it had completed its sale to Musk, with the billionaire entrepreneur taking over as CEO of the company.\n\n### Post-acquisition\n\nUnder Musk's leadership, Twitter has implemented several changes to its features and content moderation policies. The platform has also seen a significant increase in new features and updates, including the introduction of a paid verification system.\n\n**Reactions**\n\n### Takeover bid\n\nThe takeover bid was met with mixed reactions from investors and analysts, with some welcoming the potential for new growth and innovation, while others expressed concerns over Musk's leadership style and Twitter's financial performance.\n\n### Acquisition announcement\n\nThe acquisition announcement was met with widespread media attention, with many outlets speculating about the potential implications for Twitter and the tech industry as a whole.\n\n### Attempted termination\n\nThe attempted termination of the deal was seen as a significant setback for Twitter, with many investors and analysts expressing concerns over the company's financial performance and leadership.\n\n### Completion of purchase\n\nThe completion of the purchase was met with a mix of reactions, with some welcoming the new era for Twitter and others expressing concerns over Musk's leadership and the potential impact on the platform's user base.\n\n**Critical analysis**\n\n### Takeover bid and acquisition announcement\n\nThe takeover bid and acquisition announcement were seen as a significant turning point for Twitter, with many analysts praising Musk's vision and leadership, while others expressed concerns over the company's financial performance and leadership.\n\n### Attempted termination\n\nThe attempted termination of the deal was seen as a significant setback for Twitter, with many investors and analysts expressing concerns over the company's financial performance and leadership.\n\n### Revitalization of bid\n\nThe revitalization of the bid was seen as a positive development for Twitter, with many analysts praising Musk's commitment to the company and its potential for growth.\n\n### Completion of purchase\n\nThe completion of the purchase was met with a mix of reactions, with some welcoming the new era for Twitter and others expressing concerns over Musk's leadership and the potential impact on the platform's user base.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nThe acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk is a significant event in the tech industry, marking a new era for the social media platform and its users.
