A close companion of Joan of Arc, de Rais was a prominent figure in the Hundred Years' War, but his later life was marked by allegations of occult involvement, child murders, and other atrocities. This article explores his life, military career, and eventual downfall.\n\n**House of Retz**\n----------------\n\n### **Early life**\n\nGilles de Rais was born in 1404 in Champtocé, France, to a noble family of the House of Retz. His father, Guy XIII de Rais, was a member of the French nobility, and his mother, Marie de Craon, came from a wealthy family. De Rais was the youngest of five children, and his family's wealth and influence played a significant role in his life.\n\n### **Matrimonial projects**\n\nIn 1420, de Rais married Catherine de Thouars, a member of the powerful House of Thouars. The marriage was arranged to secure an alliance between the two families and to consolidate de Rais's position in the nobility. However, the marriage remained childless, and de Rais eventually sought to divorce Catherine, citing her infertility.\n\n### **Family disputes**\n\nDe Rais's family disputes began early in his life. His eldest brother, Jean de Rais, was killed in a tournament in 1416, and de Rais inherited his brother's title and estates. However, the inheritance was disputed by other family members, leading to a series of lawsuits and conflicts.\n\n### **Titles, estates and wealth**\n\nDe Rais's family was extremely wealthy, with vast estates and titles. He inherited the title of Viscount of Tonnerre and the lordship of Champtocé, among others. His family's wealth and influence allowed him to pursue a military career and to become a prominent figure in French politics.\n\n**Military career**\n-------------------\n\n### **First hypothetical feat of arms**\n\nDe Rais's military career began in 1425, when he participated in the siege of Orléans. However, his role in the siege is disputed, and some historians question whether he was actually present.\n\n### **Franco-Breton alliance through the House of Valois-Anjou**\n\nIn 1426, de Rais joined the Franco-Breton alliance, which aimed to drive the English out of France. He fought alongside the Breton leader, John V, Duke of Brittany, and the French king, Charles VII. The alliance was formed through the House of Valois-Anjou, which controlled the throne of Brittany.\n\n### **Guerilla warfare against English garrisons on the borders of Maine**\n\nDe Rais's military career continued with the guerilla warfare against English garrisons on the borders of Maine. He led a series of raids against the English, using his knowledge of the local terrain to outmaneuver his opponents.\n\n### **Companion in arms with Joan of Arc**\n\nIn 1429, de Rais joined Joan of Arc on her campaign to drive the English out of France. He fought alongside her at the siege of Orléans and at the Battle of Patay. However, his relationship with Joan of Arc was complex, and some historians question whether he was a genuine supporter of her mission.\n\n### **Civil wars between La Trémoille and Richemont's allies**\n\nAfter Joan of Arc's capture and execution, de Rais continued to fight in the civil wars between La Trémoille and Richemont's allies. He supported the claim of Louis of Orléans, who was seeking to overthrow Charles VII and take the throne for himself.\n\n### **Lifting of the siege of Lagny**\n\nIn 1436, de Rais led a successful campaign to lift the siege of Lagny, which had been laid by the English. His victory helped to secure the region and to drive the English back.\n\n### **Reduction of military commitments**\n\nHowever, de Rais's military career began to decline after 1436. He reduced his military commitments and focused on his personal life and his famil", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

Its roots lie in the ancient Middle East, where it emerged from the Jewish tradition. Over time, Christianity evolved and spread to become a global faith, shaping the course of human history in countless ways. This article provides an overview of the history of Christianity, from its early beginnings to the present day.\n\n**#Early Christianity**\n\n### **Jewish background**\n\nChristianity emerged from the Jewish tradition, with Jesus of Nazareth as its central figure. The Jewish people had lived in the Middle East for centuries, developing a rich and complex culture that emphasized the importance of monotheism and the covenant between God and his people. Jesus, a Jewish preacher and teacher, came to be seen as the Messiah, or Christ, by his followers, who believed that he had fulfilled the Jewish prophecies and brought salvation to humanity.\n\n### **Apostolic Age (c. 30–100)**\n\nThe apostolic age was a period of significant growth and development for Christianity. During this time, the disciples of Jesus, including Peter, Paul, and others, spread the message of Christianity throughout the Mediterranean world. They established churches in cities such as Jerusalem, Antioch, and Rome, and began to develop the institutional structures that would shape the Christian church for centuries to come.\n\n#### **Developing church structure**\n\nAs Christianity grew, it began to take on a more formal structure. The early churches were organized around local leaders, who were often referred to as bishops. The bishop was responsible for overseeing the spiritual well-being of the community, as well as for resolving disputes and making decisions on matters of doctrine and practice. The apostolic period also saw the emergence of the concept of the \"priesthood of all believers,\" which held that all Christians were considered to be part of a priestly class, with direct access to God.\n\n#### **Early growth**\n\nThe early Christian communities were characterized by a sense of excitement and expectation. Many of the original disciples had experienced the resurrected Jesus, and they saw themselves as being part of a new and vibrant movement that was destined to change the world. As the message of Christianity spread, it attracted a diverse range of people, including Jews, Gentiles, and women. The early Christians were known for their commitment to their faith, and for their willingness to suffer persecution and martyrdom in order to uphold their beliefs.\n\n### **Ante-Nicene period (100–312)**\n\nThe ante-Nicene period was a time of significant theological development and controversy for Christianity. During this time, the church faced a series of challenges and persecutions, including the rise of Gnosticism and other forms of heresy. The early Christian communities were also struggling to establish a clear doctrine and identity, as they faced opposition from both within and outside the church.\n\n#### **Scripture**\n\nThe ante-Nicene period saw the emergence of the Christian scriptures, which would eventually become the Bible. The early Christians recognized the importance of the Old Testament, which had been inherited from the Jewish tradition. However, they also recognized the need for a new scripture that would reflect the teachings and experiences of the Christian community. The Christian scriptures, which were initially referred to as the \"Gospels,\" began to take shape, with the writings of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John providing a foundation for the Christian faith.\n\n#### **Early Christian art**\n\nThe ante-Nicene period also saw the emergence of early Christian art, which reflected the faith and spirituality of the Christian community. The early Christians used a range of artistic forms, including mosaics, frescoes, and sculptures, to express their devotion and to tell the story of their faith. The art of the early Christian church often featured images of the cross, the Virgin Mary, and other key figures from the Christian tradition.\n\n#### **Persecutions and legalization**\n\nThe ante-Nicene period was also marked by a series of persecutions and martyrdoms, as the Roman authorities sought to suppress the Christian movement. However, in 313 CE, the Roman Emperor Constantine issued the Edict of Milan, which granted Christians the right to worship freely. This marked a significant turning point in the history of Christianity, as the church began to assume a more prominent role in public life.\n\n### **Spread of Christianity to c. 300 AD**\n\nAs Christianity spread throughout the Roman Empire, it began to take on a more inclusive and diverse character. The early Christian communities were characterized by a sense of excitement and expectation, as they sought to share the message of their faith with the wider world. The spread of Christianity was facilitated by a range of factors, including trade, travel, and migration.\n\n#### **Inclusivity, women and exclusivity**\n\nThe early Christian communities were often characterized by a sense of inclusivity and diversity, as they welcomed people from a range of backgrounds and cultures. Women played a significant role in the early Christian church, with some serving as leaders and teachers. However, the early Christian communities also struggled with issues of exclusivity, as they sought to define their boundaries and establish a clear doctrine.\n\n#### **Moral practices**\n\nThe early Christian communities were known for their commitment to moral practices, including charity, compassion, and non-violence. The early Christians saw themselves as being part of a new and vibrant movement that was destined to change the world, and they sought to live out their faith in practical and tangible ways.\n\n**#Late antiquity (313–476)**\n\nThe late antique period was a time of significant change and transformation for Christianity. As the Roman Empire began to decline, the Christian church began to assume a more prominent role in public life. The early Christian communities were characterized by a sense of excitement and expectation, as they sought to share the message of their faith with the wider world.\n\n### **Conversion of Constantine**\n\nThe conversion of Constantine in 313 CE marked a significant turning point in the history of Christianity.

Augustine, one of the most important thinkers in Christian history, developed a distinctive ethic toward Jews, which emphasized the importance of conversion and the need for Jews to recognize the truth of Christianity.\n\n### **Developing orthodoxy and heresy**\n\nThe late antique period was also marked by a series of debates and controversies, as the Christian church sought to establish its doctrine and identity.

The novel is a sweeping epic that combines elements of philosophy, history, and literature to explore the intersection of art and politics.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe novel is set in the 1960s and 1970s, during the height of the Cold War, and follows the lives of three friends, Walter, Anja, and Michael, as they navigate the complexities of revolutionary politics and artistic expression. The story is told through a series of vignettes, each of which explores a different theme or idea, from the relationship between art and politics to the nature of human consciousness.\n\nThroughout the novel, Weiss draws on a wide range of sources, from Marxist theory to psychoanalysis, to create a rich and complex portrait of the human experience. At the same time, he is deeply concerned with the ways in which art and politics intersect, and the ways in which artists can use their work to resist the dominant ideologies of their time.\n\n**Form features and structure**\n\nThe novel is written in a highly experimental style, blending elements of novel, essay, and drama to create a unique and innovative form. Each of the three volumes is structured around a different theme or idea, and each volume is composed of a series of vignettes, each of which explores a different aspect of the theme.\n\nThe vignettes are often fragmented and disjointed, reflecting the disjointed and fragmented nature of modern life. At the same time, they are also deeply philosophical and introspective, exploring the big questions of human existence and the nature of reality.\n\n**History of origins and publication**\n\n**Beginning**\n\nThe idea for The Aesthetics of Resistance began to take shape in the early 1970s, when Weiss was working as a playwright and director in Berlin. At the time, he was deeply concerned with the ways in which art and politics intersected, and he saw the novel as a way to explore these themes in a more comprehensive and systematic way.\n\n**Research**\n\nWeiss spent several years researching and writing the novel, drawing on a wide range of sources, from Marxist theory to psychoanalysis. He was particularly interested in the work of the Marxist philosopher Georg Lukacs, and the ways in which Lukacs had explored the relationship between art and politics.\n\n**Writer's block**\n\nDespite his deep commitment to the project, Weiss struggled with writer's block throughout the writing process. He often felt that he was struggling to convey the complexity and depth of his ideas, and he worried that the novel would never be finished.\n\n**The third volume**\n\nThe third and final volume of the novel was published in 1981, several years after the publication of the first two volumes. Weiss had spent several years working on the final volume, and he was deeply concerned with bringing the story to a close in a way that was both satisfying and meaningful.\n\n**Sweden and the GDR**\n\nIn the final volume of the novel, Weiss explores the relationship between Sweden and the German Democratic Republic (GDR), and the ways in which these two countries intersected in the 1970s. He is particularly interested in the ways in which the GDR used art and culture as a way to promote its ideology and values.\n\n**Other translations**\n\nThe Aesthetics of Resistance has been translated into many languages, including French, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese. The novel has been widely praised by critics and scholars, who see it as a major work of contemporary literature.\n\n**Textual forms**\n\nThroughout the novel, Weiss draws on a wide range of textual forms, from poetry to drama to philosophical treatise. He is particularly interested in the ways in which these different forms can be used to explore the big questions of human existence and the nature of reality.\n\n**Artists and artworks in the novel**\n\nWeiss is deeply interested in the ways in which art and politics intersect, and he sees the novel as a way to explore these themes in a more comprehensive and systematic way. Throughout the novel, he draws on a wide range of artists and artworks, from the Divine Comedy to the paintings of Pablo Picasso.\n\n**Divine Comedy**\n\nOne of the central artworks in the novel is Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy, which Weiss sees as a powerful and enduring work of art that explores the big questions of human existence and the nature of reality.\n\n**Central artworks**\n\nWeiss is particularly interested in the ways in which artworks can be used to explore the big questions of human existence and the nature of reality. Throughout the novel, he draws on a wide range of central artworks, from the paintings of Pablo Picasso to the sculptures of Alberto Giacometti.\n\n**Questions**\n\nWeiss is deeply concerned with the big questions of human existence and the nature of reality, and he sees the novel as a way to explore these themes in a more comprehensive and systematic way. Throughout the novel, he raises a wide range of questions, from the nature of human consciousness to the relationship between art and politics.\n\n**Reception**\n\nThe Aesthetics of Resistance has been widely praised by critics and scholars, who see it as a major work of contemporary literature. At the same time, the novel has also been the subject of controversy and debate, with some critics accusing Weiss of being too left-wing or too focused on the relationship between art and politics.\n\n**Mixed reactions in culture**\n\nIn Germany, the novel was widely praised by critics and scholars, who saw it as a major work of contemporary literature. However, the novel also sparked controversy and debate, with some critics accusing Weiss of being too left-wing or too focused on the relationship between art and politics.\n\n**Worldwide**\n\nThe novel has been translated into many languages and has been widely praised by critics and scholars worldwide. However, the novel has also been the subject of controversy and debate, with some critics accusing Weiss of being too left-wing or too focused on the relationship between art and politics.\n\n**Reading groups**\n\nThe novel has been the subject of many reading groups and discussions, both in Germany and worldwide. These reading groups have often focused on the ways in which the novel explores the big questions of human existence and the nature of reality, as well as the ways in which the novel intersects with contemporary politics and culture.\n\n**Intermedial reception**\n\nThe novel has also been the subject of intermedial reception, with many artists and writers drawing on the novel in their own work. This intermedial reception has often taken the form of visual art, music, or drama, and has often explored the ways in which the novel intersects with contemporary politics and culture.\n\n**Radio play**\n\nThe Aesthetics of Resistance has also been adapted into a radio play, which was broadcast on German radio in the 1980s. The radio play was widely praised by critics and scholars, who saw it as a powerful and enduring work of art that explored the big questions of human existence and the nature of reality.\n\n**Film**\n\nThe novel has also been adapted into a film, which was released in the 2000s. The film was widely praised by critics and scholars, who saw it as a powerful and enduring work of art that explored the big questions of human existence and the nature of reality.\n\n**Musical recordings**\n\nThe novel has also been the subject of musical recordings, with many musicians drawing on the novel in their own work. These musical recordings have often taken the form of songs or albums, and have often explored the ways in which the novel intersects with contemporary politics and culture.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Literature\n* Thesis\n* English editions in print\n* GDR reception\n\n**References**\n\n* Peter Weiss, The Aesthetics of Resistance, Vol. 1 (1975)\n* Peter Weiss, The Aesthetics of Resistance, Vol. 2 (1978)\n* Peter Weiss, The Aesthetics of Resistance, Vol. 3 (1981)\n* Peter Weiss, Letters to Boll, ed.

It is a Viking revenge tale set in 10th-century Iceland, loosely based on the legend of Amleth, a story that dates back to the 9th century. The film stars Alexander Skarsgård, Nicole Kidman, Claes Bang, and Anya Taylor-Joy.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film follows the story of Amleth, a young Viking warrior who is driven by a desire for revenge against his uncle, King Fjölnir, and his mother, Queen Gudrún, who are responsible for the murder of his father, King Aurvandil. The story begins with Amleth's father, King Aurvandil, being killed by his brother, King Fjölnir, and his mother, Queen Gudrún, who are also his wife and stepmother. Amleth, who is just a boy at the time, witnesses the murder and vows to avenge his father's death.\n\nYears pass, and Amleth grows up to be a skilled warrior, but he is also driven by his desire for revenge. He sets out on a journey to avenge his father's death, facing numerous challenges and obstacles along the way. Along the way, he meets a slave woman named Olga, who becomes his ally and potential love interest.\n\nAs Amleth navigates the complex web of Viking politics and alliances, he must also contend with his own demons and the moral implications of his actions. The film's plot is a complex and nuanced exploration of revenge, redemption, and the human condition.\n\n**Cast**\n\nThe film features a talented ensemble cast, including:\n\n* Alexander Skarsgård as Amleth\n* Nicole Kidman as Queen Gudrún\n* Claes Bang as King Fjölnir\n* Anya Taylor-Joy as Olga\n* Björk as The Witch\n* Ethan Hawke as Father\n* Willem Dafoe as The Earl\n* Gustav Lindh as Oskar\n\n**Production**\n\n### Development\n\nThe film was developed over several years, with Robert Eggers working on the script and researching the story. Eggers has stated that he was drawn to the story of Amleth because of its complexity and nuance, and he wanted to create a film that would explore the human condition in a way that was both epic and intimate.\n\n### Filming\n\nPrincipal photography for the film began in September 2019 and lasted for several months. The film was shot on location in Iceland and the UK, with a large crew and a cast of hundreds. The film's cinematographer, Jarin Blaschke, has stated that he used a combination of practical and digital effects to create the film's stunning visuals.\n\n### Post-production\n\nPost-production for the film was a lengthy and complex process, with Eggers working closely with his editor, Louise Ford, to shape the film's narrative and tone. The film's score was composed by Mark Korven, who used a combination of traditional instruments and electronic elements to create a haunting and atmospheric sound.\n\n### Music\n\nThe film's score is a key element in creating its mood and atmosphere. Korven has stated that he was inspired by the music of the period, including traditional Scandinavian folk music and the works of medieval composers. The score is a combination of traditional instruments, including the fiddle and the lute, and electronic elements, including synthesizers and samples.\n\n**Marketing**\n\n### Tie-in media\n\nTo promote the film, Eggers and his team created a series of tie-in media, including a companion book and a interactive experience. The book, which was published by Penguin Random House, provides a more in-depth look at the story and its historical context. The interactive experience, which was created by the film's visual effects team, allows audiences to explore the world of the film in a more immersive way.\n\n**Release**\n\n### Theatrical\n\nThe film was released in the United States on April 22, 2022, in select theaters and on streaming platforms. The film received a limited release, with a total of 242 theaters showing the film in its opening weekend.\n\n### Home media\n\nThe film was released on home media on June 7, 2022, in a variety of formats, including Blu-ray, DVD, and digital download. The home media release included a range of bonus features, including behind-the-scenes footage, interviews, and a making-of documentary.\n\n**Reception**\n\n### Box office\n\nThe film was a commercial success, grossing over $130 million worldwide on a budget of $90 million. The film's box office performance was impressive, given its limited release and the fact that it was a period drama.\n\n### Home media performance\n\nThe film's home media performance was also strong, with the Blu-ray and DVD versions selling well and the digital download version performing well on streaming platforms.\n\n### Critical response\n\nThe film received widespread critical acclaim, with many praising its visuals, performances, and direction. The film holds a 92% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with many critics praising its unique take on the Viking legend and its nuanced exploration of human emotions.\n\n### Accolades\n\nThe film received several awards and nominations, including:\n\n* Academy Award nomination for Best Cinematography\n* Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor in a Motion Picture – Drama (Alexander Skarsgård)\n* BAFTA nomination for Best Production Design\n* Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Action Movie\n\n**Notes**\n\nThe Northman is a unique and ambitious film that has been praised for its visuals, performances, and direction.

The election was the seventh Assembly election since the restoration of devolution in 2007 and the first to be held after the 2020 United Kingdom general election.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Electoral events\n\nThe 2022 Northern Ireland Assembly election was the first to take place since the 2017 election, which saw the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) lose their majority in the Assembly. The election was also the first to be held under the revised electoral system, which introduced a single transferable vote system in all constituencies.\n\n### Leadership changes\n\nPrior to the election, the DUP had been led by Edwin Poots, who had taken over as leader in April 2021 following the resignation of Arlene Foster. However, Poots' leadership was short-lived, and he was ousted as leader in January 2022 following a leadership challenge from Jeffrey Donaldson. Donaldson went on to lead the DUP into the election.\n\n### Northern Ireland Protocol\n\nThe Northern Ireland Protocol, a key part of the Brexit withdrawal agreement, had been a major issue in Northern Ireland politics in the run-up to the election. The protocol established a border in the Irish Sea between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, which had been opposed by many unionists. The DUP had been particularly vocal in its opposition to the protocol, arguing that it undermined the Union and created economic barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.\n\n### Calls for early election\n\nThere had been calls for an early election from some quarters, with the DUP arguing that the Assembly should be dissolved and a new election held to reflect the changed circumstances in Northern Ireland following Brexit. However, the Northern Ireland Office had indicated that the election would take place on the scheduled date of May 5, 2022.\n\n**Candidates**\n\nA total of 461 candidates stood in the election, representing 22 different parties and groups. The main parties contesting the election were the DUP, Sinn Féin, the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), the Alliance Party, and the TUV. The DUP had the largest number of candidates, with 56 nominees, followed by Sinn Féin with 46.\n\n**Members not seeking re-election**\n\nA number of sitting Assembly members chose not to stand for re-election in 2022. These included several high-profile figures, including the DUP's Sammy Wilson and the SDLP's Dolores Kelly. Several Sinn Féin members also chose not to stand, including the party's former Stormont leader, Michelle O'Neill, who had announced her decision to stand down in January 2022.\n\n**Campaign**\n\nThe campaign for the 2022 Assembly election was marked by a number of key issues, including the Northern Ireland Protocol, the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the economy. The main parties put forward a range of policies and proposals, including the DUP's commitment to opposing the protocol, Sinn Féin's call for a border poll on Irish reunification, and the Alliance Party's focus on social justice and equality.\n\n**Opinion polls**\n\nA number of opinion polls were conducted in the run-up to the election, providing an indication of public opinion and the likely outcome. The polls suggested a tight contest between Sinn Féin and the DUP, with the former party potentially emerging as the largest party in the Assembly.\n\n**Results**\n\n### Distribution of seats by constituency\n\nThe election result was as follows:\n\n* DUP: 27 seats\n* Sinn Féin: 27 seats\n* UUP: 9 seats\n* SDLP: 8 seats\n* Alliance Party: 8 seats\n* TUV: 1 seat\n* Green Party: 2 seats\n* People Before Profit: 2 seats\n* Workers' Party: 2 seats\n* Traditional Unionist Voice: 2 seats\n* Independent: 2 seats\n* Others: 1 seat\n\n### Share of first-preference votes\n\nThe share of first-preference votes was as follows:\n\n* DUP: 29.1%\n* Sinn Féin: 25.5%\n* UUP: 11.9%\n* SDLP: 10.3%\n* Alliance Party: 9.7%\n* TUV: 2.1%\n* Green Party: 2.0%\n* People Before Profit: 1.8%\n* Workers' Party: 1.6%\n* Traditional Unionist Voice: 1.5%\n* Independent: 1.3%\n* Others: 0.7%\n\n### Incumbents defeated\n\nSeveral sitting Assembly members were defeated in the election, including several high-profile figures. These included the DUP's Sammy Wilson, who was defeated by a Sinn Féin candidate in the East Antrim constituency, and the SDLP's Dolores Kelly, who was defeated by a Sinn Féin candidate in the Upper Bann constituency.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe 2022 Northern Ireland Assembly election was a significant event in Northern Irish politics, with the DUP and Sinn Féin emerging as the largest parties in the Assembly.

The goal of cataract surgery is to remove the cloudy lens and replace it with an artificial lens, known as an intraocular lens (IOL), to restore clear vision.\n\n# Uses\n\nCataract surgery is the most common and effective treatment for cataracts. It is used to treat various types of cataracts, including:\n\n* Age-related cataracts\n* Traumatic cataracts\n* Congenital cataracts\n* Secondary cataracts (after surgery or injury)\n\nThe main indication for cataract surgery is when the cataract is causing significant visual impairment, such as blurred vision, glare, or double vision.\n\n# Techniques\n\nThere are several techniques used for cataract surgery, including:\n\n## Phacoemulsification\n\nPhacoemulsification is the most common technique used for cataract surgery. It involves making a small incision in the cornea, and then using a specialized instrument to break up the cloudy lens into small pieces. The pieces are then removed with suction.\n\n## Manual Small Incision Cataract Surgery (MSICS)\n\nMSICS is a technique that involves making a small incision in the cornea and removing the cloudy lens manually. This technique is often used for complicated cataract surgery or when the patient has a pre-existing condition that makes phacoemulsification difficult.\n\n## Extracapsular Cataract Extraction (ECCE)\n\nECCE is a technique that involves removing the cloudy lens in one piece, leaving the surrounding lens capsule intact. This technique is often used for complex cataract surgery or when the patient has a pre-existing condition that makes phacoemulsification difficult.\n\n## Converting to ECCE to Manage a Contingency\n\nIn some cases, the surgeon may need to convert from phacoemulsification to ECCE during the procedure. This is usually done when the cloudy lens is too hard or too large to be broken up with phacoemulsification.\n\n## Closing the Wound\n\nAfter the cataract is removed, the wound is closed with stitches or a surgical glue. The type of closure used depends on the size of the incision and the patient's overall condition.\n\n# Pre-operative evaluation\n\nBefore undergoing cataract surgery, a thorough pre-operative evaluation is performed to assess the patient's overall health and suitability for the procedure.\n\n## Contraindications\n\nContraindications for cataract surgery include:\n\n* Active eye infection\n* Glaucoma\n* Diabetic retinopathy\n* Age-related macular degeneration\n* Previous eye surgery\n\n## Selection of Intraocular Lenses\n\nThe choice of intraocular lens (IOL) depends on the patient's refractive error, the type of cataract, and the surgeon's preference. There are several types of IOLs available, including monofocal, multifocal, and accommodating IOLs.\n\n# Operation procedures\n\nThe operation procedure for cataract surgery typically involves:\n\n## Preparation\n\nThe patient is prepared for surgery by administering local anesthesia and positioning them comfortably on the surgical table.\n\n## Anaesthesia\n\nLocal anesthesia is administered to numb the eye and prevent pain during the procedure. In some cases, sedation may also be used to relax the patient.\n\n## Phacoemulsification\n\nThe cloudy lens is broken up with phacoemulsification, and the pieces are removed with suction.\n\n## Manual Small Incision Cataract Surgery (MSICS)\n\nThe cloudy lens is removed manually through a small incision in the cornea.\n\n## Extracapsular Cataract Extraction (ECCE)\n\nThe cloudy lens is removed in one piece, leaving the surrounding lens capsule intact.\n\n## Converting to ECCE to Manage a Contingency\n\nIn some cases, the surgeon may need to convert from phacoemulsification to ECCE during the procedure.\n\n## Closing the Wound\n\nThe wound is closed with stitches or a surgical glue.\n\n# Post-operative care\n\nAfter cataract surgery, the patient is required to follow a post-operative care regimen to ensure proper healing and minimize the risk of complications.\n\n# Complications\n\nComplications can occur during or after cataract surgery. These include:\n\n## During Surgery\n\n* Intraocular lens dislocation\n* Intraocular lens injury\n* Retinal detachment\n* Glaucoma\n* Intraoperative hemorrhage\n\n## After Surgery\n\n* Infection\n* Inflammation\n* Endophthalmitis\n* Cystoid macular edema\n* Vitreous hemorrhage\n\n## Risk\n\nThe risk of complications from cataract surgery is low, but it can be increased by pre-existing conditions such as glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, or age-related macular degeneration.\n\n# Recovery and rehabilitation\n\nRecovery from cataract surgery typically takes several weeks. The patient may experience blurred vision, glare, or double vision during this time. The patient may also need to wear protective eyewear to prevent accidental injury to the eye.\n\n# Outcomes\n\nThe outcome of cataract surgery is generally very good, with most patients experiencing significant improvement in vision. The success rate of cataract surgery is high, with studies showing that over 90% of patients achieve a visual acuity of 20/40 or better after surgery.\n\n# History\n\nCataract surgery has a long history, dating back over 4,000 years. The ancient Egyptians and Sumerians performed cataract surgery using a needle to remove the cloudy lens. The ancient Greeks and Romans also performed cataract surgery, using a technique known as \"cataract extraction.\"\n\n# Accessibility\n\nCataract surgery is widely available in Europe, Asia, Africa, and Latin America. However, access to cataract surgery remains limited in some parts of the world, particularly in low-income countries.\n\n## Europe\n\nCataract surgery is widely available in Europe, with most countries having a well-developed ophthalmic care system.\n\n## Asia\n\nCataract surgery is widely available in Asia, particularly in countries such as India, China, and Japan.\n\n## Africa\n\nCataract surgery is available in many African countries, but access remains limited in some areas.\n\n## Latin America\n\nCataract surgery is widely available in Latin America, particularly in countries such as Brazil and Mexico.\n\n# Social, economic and environmental relevance\n\nCataract surgery has significant social, economic, and environmental relevance. It can improve vision and quality of life for millions of people worldwide, particularly in low-income countries where cataracts are a leading cause of blindness.\n\n# Special populations\n\nCataract surgery can be particularly challenging in special populations, such as:\n\n## Congenital Cataracts\n\nCongenital cataracts are a rare condition where the cloudy lens is present at birth. Cataract surgery is often required to treat congenital cataracts.\n\n## Higher risk for operations on separate occasions\n\nPatients who require cataract surgery on separate occasions, such as those with bilateral cataracts or those who require additional surgeries, may be at higher risk for complications.\n\n# Other animals\n\nCataract surgery is also performed in animals, such as dogs and cats. The procedure is similar to human cataract surgery, but the lens is typically removed manually.\n\n# See also\n\n* Intraocular lens\n* Phacoemulsification\n* Manual small incision cataract surgery (MSICS)\n* Extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE)\n* Congenital cataracts\n\n# Notes\n\n* This article is a general overview of cataract surgery and is not intended to be a comprehensive guide.\n* The information provided is based on current medical knowledge and may be subject to change as new research becomes available.\n\n# References\n\n* American Academy of Ophthalmology.

The black market involved the illicit trade and sale of goods and services, often at inflated prices, and was fueled by a combination of factors including rationing, price controls, and the diversion of goods from official channels.\n\n**Background**\n\n### 1930s: Inflation, Instability, and Unrest\n\nThe 1930s were marked by economic instability and inflation in France, which laid the groundwork for the black market that would develop during the war. The global economic crisis of the Great Depression had a significant impact on France, leading to high levels of unemployment and poverty. The French government responded to these challenges with a series of economic policies, including price controls and rationing, which aimed to stabilize the economy and ensure essential goods were available to the population.\n\n### Fall of France\n\nThe fall of France in 1940 marked the beginning of the German occupation, which had a profound impact on the economy and society. The occupation authorities imposed strict controls on the economy, including rationing and price controls, which led to widespread shortages and inflation. The black market emerged as a way for individuals and businesses to circumvent these controls and access goods and services that were in short supply.\n\n**1940-1941**\n\n### Origins\n\n#### Rationing and Price Controls\n\nThe rationing system, introduced by the French government in 1939, was designed to ensure that essential goods were available to the population. However, the system was flawed, and goods were often in short supply. The price controls, introduced by the occupation authorities, aimed to prevent inflation, but they led to shortages and black market activity.\n\n#### Diversion from Official Channels\n\nGoods were diverted from official channels to the black market through a variety of means, including corruption, bribery, and theft. The occupation authorities were often involved in these activities, and goods were sold on the black market at inflated prices.\n\n#### Clandestine Networks\n\nClandestine networks, including underground organizations and individual traders, played a significant role in the black market. These networks allowed goods to be traded and sold without the knowledge of the occupation authorities.\n\n#### Hidden Stockpiling\n\nIndividuals and businesses stockpiled goods, hiding them from the authorities and selling them on the black market when prices rose. This practice became increasingly common as the war progressed.\n\n#### Grey Market\n\nThe grey market, a legal but unofficial market, emerged as a way for individuals to sell goods and services that were not available through official channels. The grey market was often linked to the black market, and goods were sold at inflated prices.\n\n### Users of the Black Market\n\n#### Privileged French\n\nMembers of the privileged classes, including the wealthy and those with connections to the occupation authorities, were among the primary users of the black market. They were able to access goods and services that were in short supply, often at inflated prices.\n\n#### Occupation Forces\n\nThe occupation forces, including German soldiers and officials, also used the black market to access goods and services that were not available through official channels. They often sold goods they had acquired on the black market at inflated prices, further fueling the black market.\n\n### Public Response\n\n#### Early Condemnation\n\nThe black market was initially condemned by the French public, who saw it as a moral and economic problem. However, as the war progressed, attitudes towards the black market began to shift.\n\n#### Participation\n\nMany individuals and businesses began to participate in the black market, often out of necessity. They saw the black market as a way to access goods and services that were in short supply.\n\n#### Housewives' Demonstrations\n\nHousewives, who were particularly affected by the shortages and rationing, organized demonstrations to demand better access to goods and services. These demonstrations often targeted the black market, which was seen as a symbol of the occupation authorities' economic policies.\n\n#### Suspicions of Hoarding\n\nThere was widespread suspicion of hoarding, with many individuals and businesses accused of stockpiling goods for personal gain. The occupation authorities responded by implementing policies aimed at preventing hoarding.\n\n#### Official Antisemitism\n\nThe occupation authorities often blamed Jews for the black market, perpetuating antisemitic stereotypes. This led to further marginalization and persecution of the Jewish community.\n\n#### Public Opinion\n\nPublic opinion towards the black market was complex, with some individuals seeing it as a necessary evil and others viewing it as a moral and economic problem.\n\n#### Political Opposition\n\nThe black market was also a source of opposition to the occupation authorities, with some individuals and groups using it as a way to resist the occupation.\n\n### Response by Authorities\n\nThe occupation authorities responded to the black market with a combination of policies aimed at preventing and punishing black market activity. These policies included the establishment of a new police force, the Milice, which was tasked with enforcing the occupation authorities' economic policies.\n\n**Widespread Black Market (autumn 1941 to 1943)**\n\n### Agricultural Black Market\n\nThe agricultural black market emerged as a significant sector of the black market, with farmers and traders selling goods such as meat, dairy products, and grains on the black market.\n\n### Grey Market: Direct Sales\n\nThe grey market continued to grow, with individuals and businesses selling goods and services directly to consumers at inflated prices.\n\n### Commerce and Industry\n\nCommerce and industry were also involved in the black market, with businesses selling goods and services on the black market to access capital and maintain production.\n\n### Tacit Tolerance\n\nThe occupation authorities often showed tacit tolerance of the black market, recognizing that it was a necessary evil given the economic conditions.\n\n### No Longer Immoral\n\nAs the war progressed, attitudes towards the black market began to shift, with many individuals and businesses seeing it as a necessary evil rather than a moral and economic problem.\n\n### Nuanced and Refocused Enforcement\n\nThe occupation authorities began to enforce their economic policies in a more nuanced and refocused manner, targeting specific sectors and individuals involved in the black market.\n\n### Metrics\n\n#### Proportion of Production\n\nStudies have shown that the black market accounted for a significant proportion of production in certain sectors, such as agriculture and industry.\n\n#### Higher and More Volatile Prices\n\nPrices on the black market were often higher and more volatile than those on the official market, reflecting the risks and uncertainties associated with black market activity.\n\n#### Geographic Distribution\n\nThe black market was not distributed evenly across the country, with certain regions and cities experiencing higher levels of black market activity.\n\n#### Beneficiaries\n\nThe beneficiaries of the black market were diverse, including individuals and businesses that accessed goods and services on the black market, as well as those who profited from the black market through trade and speculation.\n\n**Patriotism (spring 1943-summer 1944)**\n\n### Enforcement for the Occupiers\n\nAs the war turned in favor of the Allies, the occupation authorities became increasingly concerned about the impact of the black market on their economic control.\n\n### Economic Pillage and the End of the German Black Market\n\nThe German black market began to decline as the Allies advanced, and the occupation authorities increasingly focused on economic pillage and the exploitation of French resources.\n\n### Countermeasures and Collaboration\n\nThe occupation authorities implemented countermeasures to prevent the black market, including collaboration with French officials and the establishment of new economic controls.\n\n### Milice vs the Black Market\n\nThe Milice, the new police force established by the occupation authorities, was tasked with enforcing the economic policies and preventing black market activity.\n\n### Fraud and Resistance\n\nAs the war progressed, the black market became increasingly linked to resistance efforts, with many individuals and groups using the black market to support the resistance and undermine the occupation authorities.\n\n### Resistance Encouragement\n\nThe black market was often encouraged by the resistance, who saw it as a way to undermine the occupation authorities and access goods and services that were in short supply.\n\n### Blaming the Resistance\n\nThe occupation authorities often blamed the resistance for the black market, perpetuating a narrative that the resistance was responsible for the economic problems faced by the population.\n\n### End of the Occupation\n\nThe end of the occupation marked the end of the black market as a significant sector of the economy, but it also marked the beginning of a new era of economic challenges and opportunities for France.\n\n**After the Liberation (1944-1949)**\n\n### Épuration and Illicit Profits\n\nThe aftermath of the liberation saw a period of épuration, or purification, aimed at rooting out individuals and groups who had profited from the black market.\n\n### Pursuit and Punishment\n\nThose who had profited from the black market were pursued and punished, with many facing trial and imprisonment for their crimes.\n\n### Confiscation of Illicit Profits\n\nIllicit profits were confiscated, and those who had benefited from the black market were forced to return their gains.\n\n### Continued Black Market Operations\n\nDespite the efforts to eradicate the black market, it continued to operate in some form, with many individuals and businesses continuing to engage in black market activity.\n\n### Continued Trafficking\n\nTrafficking and smuggling continued to be a problem, with goods and services being traded and sold on the black market.\n\n### Generalized Fraud\n\nGeneralized fraud became a major issue, with many individuals and businesses engaging in fraudulent activities, including tax evasion and embezzlement.\n\n### Government Powerlessness\n\nThe government struggled to respond to the black market, with many officials and politicians feeling powerless to stop its activities.\n\n### Towards the Free Market\n\nAs the war drew to a close, France began to transition towards a free market economy, with the government implementing policies aimed at promoting competition and reducing the role of the state in the economy.\n\n**Historical Memory**\n\n### Historiography\n\nThe history of the black market in wartime France has been extensively studied and documented by historians, with many works exploring its social, economic, and cultural context.\n\n### Collective Unconscious and Cultural Roots\n\nThe black market has become an integral part of French collective memory, with many individuals and groups drawing on its mythology and symbolism in their cultural and artistic works.\n\n### Early Recollections\n\nEarly recollections of the black market often focused on its moral and economic aspects, with many individuals and groups viewing it as a necessary evil or a moral failing.\n\n### Marcel Aymé\n\nMarcel Aymé, a French writer and playwright, wrote extensively on the black market, using it as a symbol of the occupation authorities' economic policies and the resistance's efforts to undermine them.\n\n### Major Works\n\nSome notable works on the black market include:\n\n*   **La Traversée de Paris** (The Crossing of Paris), a novel by Marcel Aymé that explores the black market in wartime Paris.\n*   **Au bon beurre** (The Good Butter), a novel by Marcel Aymé that satirizes the black market and the occupation authorities' economic policies.\n\n### Historical Figures\n\nSome notable historical figures associated with the black market include:\n\n*   **L'Étrange Monsieur Joseph** (The Strange Mr. Joseph), a fictional character created by Marcel Aymé who becomes embroiled in the black market and the resistance.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

Truss continued to work in finance and later became a senior partner at the investment firm Cable & Wireless.\n\nIn 2007, Truss was re-elected to the same constituency, becoming the Member of Parliament (MP) for Chesham and Amersham. She served as a junior shadow minister for children, schools, and families.\n\n### **Backbencher (2010–2012)**\n\nFollowing the 2010 general election, Truss became a backbencher, focusing on local issues and advocating for the interests of her constituents.

The battle was one of the most significant and bloody episodes of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, with both sides suffering heavy losses.\n\nBackground\n----------\n\nThe city of Bakhmut, with a pre-war population of approximately 70,000, is a strategic location in eastern Ukraine, situated near the Donbas coal basin and the railway connecting Donetsk to Kharkiv. The area had been a hotspot of conflict since the early days of the Donbas War, with Ukrainian and Russian-backed separatist forces vying for control.\n\nBattle\n------\n\n### Early shelling and Russian encroachment (August–October 2022)\n\nThe battle began on August 1, 2022, when Russian forces launched a large-scale artillery bombardment of Bakhmut, targeting the city's infrastructure and residential areas. The Ukrainian military responded with airstrikes and artillery counterattacks, but the Russian forces continued to make gains, pushing into the city and establishing a foothold.\n\n### Early winter escalation (November–December 2022)\n\nAs winter set in, the fighting intensified, with both sides suffering heavy losses. The Russian forces launched a series of ground assaults, attempting to capture key infrastructure and strategic locations within the city. The Ukrainian military, however, managed to hold their ground, employing a combination of infantry, artillery, and air support to repel the Russian advances.\n\n### Capture of Soledar and partial encirclement (January–April 2023)\n\nIn January 2023, the Russian forces captured the nearby town of Soledar, which had been a key Ukrainian stronghold. This victory gave the Russian forces a strategic advantage, as they were now able to surround Bakhmut from multiple directions. The Ukrainian military, however, continued to hold out, employing a scorched-earth policy to deny the Russian forces access to resources and supplies.\n\n### Ukrainian flanking counterattacks begin (May 2023)\n\nIn May 2023, the Ukrainian military launched a series of flanking counterattacks, aiming to break the Russian encirclement and relieve the pressure on Bakhmut. These attacks, combined with a continued artillery and air bombardment, began to push the Russian forces back and create a window of opportunity for the Ukrainian forces to regroup and reorganize.\n\n### Capture of Bakhmut and Wagner withdrawal (20 May–early June 2023)\n\nOn May 20, 2023, the Ukrainian military captured the city of Bakhmut, marking a significant victory in the battle. The Russian forces, led by the Wagner Group, had been forced to withdraw from the city, abandoning their positions and equipment. The victory came at a great cost, however, with both sides suffering heavy losses.\n\nMilitary strength and tactics\n---------------------------\n\nThe battle was characterized by the use of advanced military tactics and technology on both sides. The Russian forces employed a combination of artillery, air support, and ground assaults to try and capture Bakhmut, while the Ukrainian military employed a scorched-earth policy, combined with artillery and air support, to defend the city.\n\nThe Russian forces, led by the Wagner Group, were skilled and experienced fighters, but they were also heavily outnumbered and outgunned. The Ukrainian military, on the other hand, had the advantage of fighting on their home turf, with a deep understanding of the local terrain and population.\n\nAftermath\n----------\n\n### Strategic value\n\nThe battle for Bakhmut was a significant strategic victory for the Ukrainian military, as it denied the Russian forces a key location and captured a valuable prize. The victory also highlighted the bravery and determination of the Ukrainian forces, who fought against overwhelming odds to secure the city.\n\n### Battlefield conditions\n\nThe battle was fought in difficult conditions, with both sides suffering heavy losses. The Russian forces were forced to operate in a hostile environment, with limited resources and support, while the Ukrainian military had the advantage of fighting on their home turf.\n\n### Casualties\n\n#### Military casualties\n\nBoth sides suffered heavy military casualties during the battle. The exact number of casualties is not known, but estimates suggest that hundreds of soldiers were killed or wounded on both sides.\n\n#### Civilian casualties\n\nThe battle also caused significant civilian casualties, with many civilians trapped in the crossfire. Estimates suggest that hundreds of civilians were killed or injured during the battle.\n\n### Attrition\n\nThe battle was a significant example of attrition warfare, with both sides suffering heavy losses.

It is one of the largest and most important museums in the state, with a collection of over 200,000 objects. The museum showcases the history and culture of Hesse, as well as art and science from around the world.\n\n**History**\n\nThe Hessian State Museum was founded in 1877 as the \"Großherzoglich Hessisches Landesmuseum\". The museum's origins date back to the 18th century, when the Grand Duchy of Hesse was a major cultural and economic center. The museum's first director was the historian and archaeologist, Wilhelm Wackernagel. Wackernagel was instrumental in shaping the museum's early collections and exhibitions, which focused on the history and culture of Hesse.\n\nDuring the 19th and early 20th centuries, the museum expanded its collections and exhibitions to include art, natural history, and science. The museum's collections grew rapidly, and by the mid-20th century, the museum had outgrown its original building. In the 1960s, the museum underwent a major renovation and expansion, which included the construction of a new wing to house the museum's growing collections.\n\n**Building**\n\nThe Hessian State Museum is located in a beautiful park in the heart of Darmstadt. The museum's current building was designed by the architect, Hans Scharoun, and was completed in 1969. The building is a stunning example of modern architecture, with a sleek and minimalist design that reflects the museum's focus on art and science.\n\n##Location\n\nThe museum is situated in the Prinz-Georg-Garten, a beautiful park that was once the private gardens of the Grand Dukes of Hesse. The park is home to many beautiful sculptures and monuments, and offers stunning views of the surrounding city.\n\n##Renovations and extensions\n\nIn recent years, the museum has undergone several renovations and extensions, including the construction of a new wing to house the museum's growing collections. The new wing, which was completed in 2010, features state-of-the-art facilities and exhibition spaces, and provides visitors with a unique and immersive experience.\n\n**Collections**\n\nThe Hessian State Museum's collections are vast and diverse, with over 200,000 objects on display. The museum's collections include:\n\n* Archaeological artifacts from ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome\n* Art and artifacts from the Middle Ages and Renaissance\n* Natural history specimens and artifacts from around the world\n* Science and technology exhibits, including interactive displays and artifacts\n* Historical artifacts from the history of Hesse, including the Grand Duchy of Hesse and the Nazi era\n\n**Gallery**\n\nThe museum's galleries are designed to provide visitors with a unique and immersive experience.

She rose to fame in the 1960s as a model and actress, and later became a successful singer, known for her distinctive voice and hit songs such as \"Di Do Da\" and \"Baby Alone in Bombay\".\n\n**Early life**\n\nBirkin was born to David Birkin, a writer, and Judy Martin, a schoolteacher. Her parents were both English, and she has a younger brother, Andrew Birkin, who is also a writer.

They recorded several duets together, including \"Je T'aime... Moi Non Plus\" (1969), which became a huge hit. The song was banned in several countries due to its explicit content, but it remains one of Birkin's most famous songs.\n\nBirkin and Gainsbourg continued to work together on various projects, including the 1971 film \"Slogan\", in which they both starred. They also recorded several other duets, including \"Stairway to Heaven\" and \"Lady Blue\".\n\n### Later performances and recordings\n\nIn the 1970s, Birkin continued to act and record music, releasing several albums, including \"Di Do Da\" (1973) and \"Baby Alone in Bombay\" (1977). She also appeared in several films, including \"The Thief and the Cobbler\" (1975) and \"Kean\" (1978).\n\nIn the 1980s, Birkin's music career slowed down, but she continued to act in films and television shows. She appeared in the 1985 film \"Lost and Found\" and the 1987 television series \"Magic, Magic\".\n\n**Personal life**\n\n### Death\n\nJane Birkin passed away on July 16, 2023, at the age of 76, due to complications from a long illness.\n\n### Philanthropy\n\nBirkin was involved in several charitable organizations, including the Jane Birkin Foundation, which she established in 2009 to support arts education and cultural exchange programs.\n\n### Political views and activism\n\nBirkin was known for her liberal and feminist views.

She was also awarded the Order of Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres by the French government in 1999.\n\n**In popular culture**\n\n### Birkin basket\n\nBirkin's name is often associated with the Birkin bag, a luxury handbag designed by Hermès.
