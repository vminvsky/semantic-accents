These events can have significant political and logistical consequences, as they often involve the appointment of a new judge to fill the vacancy.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe federal judiciary has a long history, dating back to the Judiciary Act of 1789, which established the United States Supreme Court and the federal district courts. Over the years, the federal judiciary has grown in size and complexity, with the creation of new courts and the appointment of additional judges. Despite this growth, the death of a federal judge in active service remains a relatively rare event.\n\n**Political consequences**\n\nThe death of a federal judge in active service can have significant political consequences, as it often involves the appointment of a new judge to fill the vacancy. This process can be contentious, as it involves the nomination and confirmation of a new judge by the President and the Senate. In some cases, the appointment of a new judge can be influenced by politics, as different factions may have competing interests in the vacancy.\n\nIn addition to the appointment of a new judge, the death of a federal judge in active service can also have broader political implications. For example, it can create a vacancy on the court that may be filled by a judge with a different ideological perspective, potentially shifting the balance of the court.\n\n**Logistical consequences**\n\nThe death of a federal judge in active service can also have significant logistical consequences, particularly in terms of the administration of justice. When a judge dies, their duties and responsibilities must be transferred to another judge, which can be a complex and time-consuming process.\n\nIn some cases, the death of a federal judge in active service can also create a backlog of cases, as the court may be operating with a reduced number of judges. This can have a significant impact on the administration of justice, particularly in high-volume courts such as the federal district courts.\n\n**Lists**\n\nThe following lists provide a comprehensive overview of the deaths of United States federal judges in active service:\n\n### 1789–1869\n\nDuring this period, the federal judiciary was relatively small, with a total of 17 judges serving on the federal courts.

The protests were primarily driven by the economic crisis facing the country, which had led to severe shortages of food, fuel, and other essential goods, as well as a sharp devaluation of the Sri Lankan rupee.\n\n**Background**\n\nSri Lanka had been facing a severe economic crisis for several years, which was exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The country's foreign exchange reserves had dwindled, and the government had taken on significant debt to try to keep the economy afloat. However, this had led to a sharp increase in inflation, which had reduced the purchasing power of the population. The economic crisis had also led to a severe shortage of fuel, which had affected the transportation of goods and people. The government had tried to address the crisis by imposing price controls and rationing fuel, but these measures had only made things worse.\n\n**Timeline**\n\n### March\n\nThe first protests took place on March 31, 2022, when a group of students and activists gathered in front of the Sri Lankan parliament building to demand action from the government to address the economic crisis. The protests were peaceful, but they quickly gained momentum, with more and more people joining in. The government responded by imposing a state of emergency and deploying the military to control the crowds.\n\n### April\n\n#### Declaration of state of emergency\n\nOn April 1, 2022, the government declared a state of emergency, which gave the military the power to arrest and detain people without charge.

The session was tense, with opposition MPs criticizing the government's handling of the crisis.\n\n#### \"Occupy Galle Face\"\n\nOn April 7, 2022, a group of protesters gathered in front of the Galle Face Green, a popular public space in Colombo, to demand action from the government.

The resignation was seen as a major blow to the government, which had been struggling to maintain its legitimacy.\n\n#### Deployment of military\n\nOn May 10, 2022, the military was deployed to control the crowds and maintain order. The move was seen as an attempt to crack down on the protests and restore order.\n\n#### Founding of No-Deal-Gama\n\nOn May 11, 2022, a new protest movement, No-Deal-Gama, was founded by a group of activists and protesters. The movement was seen as a challenge to the government's authority and a call for greater democracy and accountability.\n\n### June\n\nIn June 2022, the protests continued, with many people calling for the government to take action to address the economic crisis.

The film is a reboot of the Batman film series and stars Robert Pattinson as the titular character, alongside Zoë Kravitz, Paul Dano, and Jeffrey Wright. The film follows the story of a darker and more complex take on the character, exploring themes of class conflict and inequality.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film is set in a dark and gritty version of Gotham City, where crime and corruption run rampant. Bruce Wayne (Robert Pattinson) has been training to become Batman for several years, but his skills are put to the test when the Riddler (Paul Dano) begins to terrorize the city with a series of complex puzzles and murders. As Batman delves deeper into the mystery, he discovers that the Riddler is seeking revenge against the corrupt and wealthy elite of Gotham, and that he is being manipulated by a larger force.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Robert Pattinson as Bruce Wayne / Batman\n* Zoë Kravitz as Selina Kyle / Catwoman\n* Paul Dano as Edward Nashton / The Riddler\n* Jeffrey Wright as James Gordon\n* John Turturro as Carmine Falcone\n* Peter Sarsgaard as Gil Colson\n* Andy Serkis as Alfred Pennyworth\n* Colin Farrell as Oswald Cobblepot / The Penguin\n\n**Production**\n\n### Development\n\nThe idea for a new Batman film began to take shape in 2017, when DC Films announced that Ben Affleck would be directing and starring in a solo Batman film. However, Affleck stepped down as director in 2018, and the project was put on hold.\n\n### Redevelopment under Matt Reeves\n\nMatt Reeves was brought on board to direct the film in 2019, and he began to redevelop the project from scratch. Reeves has stated that he drew inspiration from the 1989 Batman film directed by Tim Burton, as well as the 1992 film Batman Returns. He also consulted with comic book creators and fans to get a better understanding of the character.\n\n### Writing\n\nThe screenplay for The Batman was written by Matt Reeves and Dylan Clark. Reeves has stated that he wanted to create a more complex and nuanced take on the character, one that explored the psychological and emotional depths of Bruce Wayne.\n\n### Casting\n\nThe casting process for The Batman was a long and arduous one, with many actors being considered for the role of Bruce Wayne. Robert Pattinson was ultimately cast in the role, and he underwent a rigorous training program to prepare for the physical demands of the part.\n\n### Design\n\n#### Sets and props\n\nThe production design for The Batman was overseen by James Chinlund, who created a dark and gritty version of Gotham City. The sets were built to resemble a mix of Gothic and Art Deco architecture, with a focus on creating a sense of decay and neglect.\n\n#### Batsuit\n\nThe Batsuit for The Batman was designed by Louise Mingenbach, who worked closely with Pattinson to create a suit that was both functional and visually striking. The suit features a distinctive yellow utility belt and a cowl that is designed to be more streamlined and aerodynamic.\n\n#### Other costumes\n\nThe costumes for the film were designed by Louise Mingenbach and Christopher Hargadon. The Riddler's costume, in particular, features a distinctive red and black color scheme and a mask that is designed to resemble a puzzle piece.\n\n**Filming**\n\n### Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the production of The Batman, with many scenes being filmed in isolation and with social distancing measures in place. The cast and crew underwent regular testing and followed strict safety protocols to minimize the risk of infection.\n\n**Editing**\n\nThe editing process for The Batman was overseen by William Hoy and Tyler Nelson. The film features a complex and non-linear narrative, with many scenes being intercut and layered to create a sense of tension and suspense.\n\n**Visual effects**\n\nThe visual effects for The Batman were created by MPC and Weta Digital. The film features a range of complex visual effects, including the Batmobile, the Batwing, and the city of Gotham.\n\n**Music**\n\nThe music for The Batman was composed by Michael Giacchino, who created a dark and atmospheric score that incorporates a range of themes and motifs. The score features a mix of orchestral and electronic elements, with a focus on creating a sense of tension and suspense.\n\n**Marketing**\n\nThe marketing campaign for The Batman was launched in 2021, with a series of teaser trailers and posters being released. The campaign centered around the idea of \"The Dark Knight\" and the idea of a more complex and nuanced take on the character.\n\n**Release**\n\n### Theatrical\n\nThe Batman was released in theaters on March 4, 2022, in the United States and other countries. The film was a critical and commercial success, grossing over $770 million worldwide and receiving widespread critical acclaim.\n\n### Home media\n\nThe Batman was released on digital platforms on April 25, 2022, and on Blu-ray and DVD on May 24, 2022.\n\n**Reception**\n\n### Box office\n\nThe Batman was a commercial success, grossing over $770 million worldwide.

The film features a range of characters who are struggling to survive in a city that is dominated by corrupt and wealthy elites.\n\n### Depiction of Batman\n\nThe film features a complex and nuanced take on the character of Batman, one that explores the psychological and emotional depths of Bruce Wayne. The film shows Batman as a character who is driven by a sense of justice and a desire to protect the people of Gotham, but who is also struggling with his own demons and personal issues.\n\n**Future**\n\n### Sequels and shared universe\n\nThe Batman is part of a larger shared universe of DC Films, and it is likely that the character will appear in future films and television shows. Matt Reeves has stated that he would like to explore the character's backstory and his relationships with other characters in future films.\n\n### Spin-off series\n\n* **The Penguin**: A spin-off series featuring Colin Farrell as Oswald Cobblepot / The Penguin is in development, with Matt Reeves serving as executive producer.\n* **Unproduced series**: A number of other spin-off series are in development, including a series featuring Zoë Kravitz as Selina Kyle / Catwoman and a series featuring Jeffrey Wright as James Gordon.\n\n**Notes**\n\nThe Batman is a complex and nuanced take on the character of Batman, one that explores the psychological and emotional depths of Bruce Wayne.

I will do my best to provide a comprehensive article while adhering to the requirements.\n\n**Norfolk and Western 611**\n\nThe Norfolk and Western 611 is a steam locomotive built by the Norfolk and Western Railway (N&W) in 1950. It was the last steam locomotive built for the N&W and is considered one of the most iconic and powerful steam locomotives in the world.\n\n**Design and Abilities**\n\nThe 611 is a Class A, 4-8-0 locomotive, with a total weight of 554,000 pounds (251,000 kg) and a power output of 3,000 horsepower (2,200 kW). It is 87 feet 6 inches (26.67 meters) long and 10 feet 5 inches (3.18 meters) high. The locomotive has a 69-inch (1,757 mm) driving wheel diameter and a 72-inch (1,829 mm) driver diameter. The firebox has a grate area of 79 square feet (7.34 square meters) and a heating surface of 9,100 square feet (845 square meters).\n\nThe 611 is equipped with a high-pressure, high-output boiler that is capable of producing steam at 400 pounds per square inch (2,800 kPa). It has a 3,000-gallon (11,356-liter) water tank and a 1,000-gallon (3,785-liter) fuel tank. The locomotive is powered by a 3-cylinder, triple-expansion steam engine that produces 3,000 horsepower (2,200 kW) at 200 rpm.\n\n**History**\n\nThe Norfolk and Western 611 was built in 1950 by the Roanoke Shops of the Norfolk and Western Railway in Roanoke, Virginia. It was the 611th locomotive built by the N&W and was originally numbered 611 and later renumbered 1218. The locomotive was designed to haul heavy coal trains over the N&W's mountainous terrain in the Appalachian region.\n\n#### Revenue Service\n\nThe 611 was initially assigned to the N&W's Roanoke Division and was used to haul coal trains between the coal fields of West Virginia and Virginia and the company's steel mills in Roanoke. The locomotive quickly gained a reputation for its power and reliability, and it was soon promoted to the N&W's elite guest locomotive program.\n\n#### First Retirement\n\nIn 1964, the N&W began to phase out its steam locomotives in favor of diesel-electric locomotives. The 611 was initially retired in 1964, but it was later stored at the Roanoke Shops and maintained in working condition.\n\n#### First Mainline Excursion Service\n\nIn the 1970s, the 611 began to participate in mainline excursion service, hauling tourist trains over the N&W's main line. The locomotive was restored to its original condition and was equipped with a new paint scheme and a period-correct interior.\n\n#### Second Retirement\n\nIn 1984, the 611 was retired for a second time, this time due to the increasing costs of maintaining the locomotive and the decreasing demand for steam power. The locomotive was placed in storage at the N&W's Elizabeth River Shops in Norfolk, Virginia.\n\n#### Second Mainline Excursion Service\n\nIn 1990, the 611 was restored to excursion service and began to participate in mainline excursions over the N&W's main line. The locomotive was equipped with a new paint scheme and a period-correct interior, and it was used to haul tourist trains between Roanoke and Norfolk.\n\n#### Post-NS Excursion Service\n\nIn 1982, the N&W was merged with the Southern Railway to form the Norfolk Southern Railway (NS). The 611 continued to participate in mainline excursion service, hauling tourist trains over the NS's main line. In 2017, the locomotive was restored to its original condition and was used to haul the NS's 60th Anniversary Train.\n\n**Accidents and Incidents**\n\nThe Norfolk and Western 611 has been involved in several accidents and incidents during its service life. In 1956, the locomotive was involved in a collision with a freight train in Virginia, resulting in minor damage to the locomotive. In 1974, the locomotive was involved in a derailment in West Virginia, resulting in significant damage to the locomotive and several injuries to crew members.\n\n**In Popular Culture**\n\nThe Norfolk and Western 611 has been featured in several films and television shows, including \"The Great Locomotive Chase\" and \"The Railway Series\". The locomotive has also been featured in several books and magazines, including \"Trains\" and \"Railfan\".\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Norfolk and Western Railway\n* Norfolk Southern Railway\n* Steam locomotive\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The Norfolk and Western 611 is a 4-8-0 locomotive, with a total weight of 554,000 pounds (251,000 kg) and a power output of 3,000 horsepower (2,200 kW).\n* The locomotive is 87 feet 6 inches (26.67 meters) long and 10 feet 5 inches (3.18 meters) high.\n* The 611 is equipped with a high-pressure, high-output boiler that is capable of producing steam at 400 pounds per square inch (2,800 kPa).\n\n**References**\n\n* \"Norfolk and Western 611\".

Jackson Women's Health Organization\n\nThe Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization case was a landmark Supreme Court decision in the United States that overruled the constitutional right to abortion established by Roe v. Wade. The case involved a challenge to a Mississippi law that banned most abortions after 15 weeks of gestation.\n\nBackground\n\n### Common Law\n\nPrior to the Roe v. Wade decision in 1973, abortion laws varied widely from state to state. Many states had laws that prohibited abortion, while others allowed it in certain circumstances. The common law had traditionally viewed abortion as a crime, but the American Medical Association and other medical organizations had advocated for more liberal abortion laws in the early 20th century.\n\n### Constitutional Right\n\nThe Roe v. Wade decision established a constitutional right to abortion, holding that the right to privacy, as described in Griswold v. Connecticut, extended to a woman's decision to have an abortion. The court established a trimester framework, which allowed states to regulate abortion in the second trimester but prohibited them from banning it in the first trimester. The court also allowed states to ban abortion in the third trimester, except where necessary to preserve the life or health of the woman.\n\n### Evolution of the Composition of the Supreme Court\n\nThe composition of the Supreme Court had changed significantly since the Roe v. Wade decision. In 2020, the court had become more conservative, with three new justices appointed by President Trump: Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett. This shift in the court's composition led many to predict that the court would overturn Roe v. Wade.\n\nGestational Age Act\n\n### Lower Courts\n\nThe Mississippi law at issue in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization banned most abortions after 15 weeks of gestation. The law was challenged in federal court by the Jackson Women's Health Organization, a clinic that provided abortion services in Mississippi. The district court ruled in favor of the clinic, holding that the law was unconstitutional. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the district court's decision, holding that the law was constitutional.\n\nSupreme Court\n\n### Oral Argument\n\nThe case was argued before the Supreme Court on December 1, 2021. The court heard arguments from the clinic's attorneys, as well as from the state of Mississippi and the U.S. Solicitor General. The justices asked questions about the constitutionality of the law, as well as about the impact of the law on women's health and rights.\n\n### Leaked Draft Opinion\n\nOn May 2, 2022, a leaked draft opinion was published by Politico, revealing that the court was poised to overturn Roe v. Wade. The draft opinion, written by Justice Samuel Alito, argued that the court had erred in establishing a constitutional right to abortion and that the decision should be overturned. The leak caused widespread outrage and protests across the country.\n\n### Reactions\n\nThe leak of the draft opinion sparked immediate reactions from politicians, activists, and ordinary citizens. Many expressed outrage and dismay at the prospect of the court overturning Roe v. Wade. Others celebrated the potential outcome, seeing it as a victory for the anti-abortion movement. The leak also sparked calls for increased security measures at the Supreme Court, as well as investigations into how the draft opinion was leaked.\n\n### Investigation\n\nThe Supreme Court launched an investigation into the leak, led by the Court's Marshal, Gail Curley. The investigation aimed to identify the source of the leak and to determine how the draft opinion was obtained. The investigation was ongoing at the time of publication.\n\nOpinions\n\n### Majority Opinion\n\nOn June 24, 2022, the court issued its decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization. The majority opinion, written by Justice Alito, held that the court had erred in establishing a constitutional right to abortion and that the decision should be overturned. The majority opinion also held that the Mississippi law at issue was constitutional, as it did not ban abortion entirely but rather regulated it after 15 weeks of gestation.\n\n### Concurrences\n\nJustice Thomas wrote a concurring opinion, arguing that the court should consider overturning other precedents, including Griswold v. Connecticut, which established a right to privacy. Justice Kavanaugh wrote a concurrence, arguing that the court should allow states to regulate abortion in the second trimester but not in the third trimester.\n\n### Concurrence in Judgment\n\nChief Justice Roberts wrote a concurrence in judgment, arguing that the court should have considered the plain meaning of the Constitution when establishing a right to abortion. However, he agreed with the majority opinion, holding that the Mississippi law at issue was constitutional.\n\n### Dissent\n\nJustices Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan wrote a dissenting opinion, arguing that the court had erred in overturning Roe v. Wade and that the decision was a significant setback for women's rights and health. They argued that the majority opinion was based on a flawed understanding of the Constitution and that it would have serious consequences for women across the country.\n\nImpact\n\n### Pre-Decision\n\nPrior to the decision, many states had passed laws restricting abortion access. In 2021, the Guttmacher Institute reported that 21 states had laws restricting abortion, while 14 states had laws expanding access. The Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision was seen as a significant threat to abortion access, as it would allow states to ban abortion entirely.\n\n### Post-Decision\n\nThe decision has had significant consequences for abortion access across the country. Many states have passed laws restricting abortion, while others have passed laws expanding access. The decision has also sparked widespread protests and activism, as well as calls for increased security measures at the Supreme Court.\n\n### State Laws Restricting Abortion\n\n#### EMTALA and Federal Preemption\n\nThe Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision has raised concerns about the impact on the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA). EMTALA requires hospitals to provide emergency medical care, including abortion, in certain circumstances. The decision has sparked debates about whether states can ban abortion and still comply with EMTALA.\n\n### State Laws Expanding Abortion Access\n\nSome states have responded to the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision by passing laws expanding abortion access. In 2022, the state of Illinois passed a law protecting access to abortion, while the state of Oregon passed a law expanding access to abortion services. Other states, such as California and New York, have also passed laws expanding access to abortion.\n\n### Congressional Proposals\n\nCongress has responded to the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision by proposing several bills to protect access to abortion. The Women's Health Protection Act, for example, would prohibit states from banning abortion and would require clinics to provide abortion services. Other bills, such as the Equal Access to Abortion Coverage in the Military (EACH) Act, would expand access to abortion for military personnel and their families.\n\n### Executive Action by President Biden\n\nPresident Biden has responded to the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision by taking executive action to protect access to abortion. In 2022, he issued an executive order protecting access to abortion, which included guidance for states to protect access to abortion. He also issued an executive order expanding access to abortion services for military personnel and their families.\n\n### Medical Abortion, In Vitro Fertilization, and Other Processes\n\nThe Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision has raised concerns about the impact on medical abortion, in vitro fertilization (IVF), and other reproductive health services. Some states have passed laws restricting access to these services, while others have passed laws expanding access.\n\n### Data Privacy\n\nThe Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision has raised concerns about data privacy, particularly with regard to reproductive health data. The decision has sparked debates about whether states can require clinics to share reproductive health data with law enforcement agencies.\n\n### 2022 and 2024 United States Election Seasons\n\nThe Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision has had significant consequences for the 2022 and 2024 United States election seasons. Many politicians have campaigned on a platform of expanding access to abortion, while others have campaigned on a platform of restricting access.\n\n### Effects on Abortion Rates\n\nThe Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision has had significant effects on abortion rates across the country. Some states have seen a significant increase in abortion rates, while others have seen a significant decrease.\n\n### Effects on Infant Mortality\n\nThe Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision has also had significant effects on infant mortality rates across the country. Some states have seen a significant increase in infant mortality rates, while others have seen a significant decrease.\n\nReaction\n\n### Legal Journalists\n\nLegal journalists have responded to the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision with a range of opinions. Some have hailed the decision as a victory for the anti-abortion movement, while others have seen it as a significant setback for women's rights and health.\n\n### Political\n\n#### Support\n\nMany politicians have expressed support for the Dobbs v.

The game was played between the Third Australian Divisional Squad and the Australian Training Units Squad at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. This event was a significant milestone in Australian sports history, marking the first time two Australian teams faced off in a football match.\n\n**Origin**\n\nThe idea for the game was conceived by General John Monash, a prominent Australian military leader and sports enthusiast. Monash believed that sport had a vital role to play in maintaining the morale and physical fitness of soldiers during wartime.

I'll do my best to provide a comprehensive article, but I may need to make some adjustments to ensure it meets the requirements.\n\n**The Whale (2022 film)**\n\nThe Whale is a 2022 American drama film directed by Darren Aronofsky and written by Samuel D. Hunter. The film stars Brendan Fraser, Sadie Sink, Hong Chau, and Samantha Morton. The film is an adaptation of Hunter's 2012 play of the same name, which premiered at the Humana Festival of New American Plays in Louisville, Kentucky.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film tells the story of Charlie, a reclusive English teacher in his mid-50s, who weighs over 600 pounds and is struggling with a life-threatening health condition. Charlie lives alone in a small apartment in Omaha, Nebraska, and spends most of his time watching television and eating junk food. He is desperate to reconnect with his estranged daughter, Ellie, who is now a teenager and living with her mother in another city.\n\nDespite his physical limitations, Charlie is determined to improve his life and reconnect with his daughter. He starts taking care of himself, including losing weight and learning to play the piano again. However, his efforts are hindered by his own self-destructive tendencies and the disapproval of those around him.\n\nAs Charlie navigates his complex and often painful relationships, he must also confront the trauma and guilt that has haunted him for years. Through his journey, Charlie learns valuable lessons about love, forgiveness, and redemption.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Brendan Fraser as Charlie\n* Sadie Sink as Ellie\n* Hong Chau as Liz\n* Samantha Morton as Mary\n* Ty Simpkins as Thomas\n* Sam Douglas as Tom\n\n**Production**\n\n#### Writing and casting\n\nThe Whale was written by Samuel D. Hunter, who adapted his 2012 play of the same name for the screen. The film was originally set to be directed by Brandon Cronenberg, but he dropped out due to creative differences. Darren Aronofsky was subsequently brought on board to direct the film, with Fraser and Hunter serving as producers.\n\nFraser was cast in the lead role of Charlie, despite being largely absent from the film industry for several years. He reportedly lost over 100 pounds to play the role, which required him to undergo a significant physical transformation. The rest of the cast was assembled through a combination of auditions and casting calls.\n\n#### Filming\n\nThe film was shot on location in Omaha, Nebraska, over the course of several weeks in the fall of 2021. The production team worked closely with local authorities to ensure that the film was shot safely and respectfully, given the sensitive nature of the subject matter.\n\nAronofsky has stated that he aimed to create a film that was both visually stunning and emotionally resonant, using a combination of close-ups, long takes, and natural lighting to capture the intricate details of Fraser's performance.\n\n**Release**\n\nThe Whale was initially set to be released in theaters in the fall of 2022, but it was pushed back to December 9, 2022, due to production delays. The film was released in a limited capacity, playing in select theaters in the United States and Canada.\n\nDespite its initial limited release, The Whale received widespread critical acclaim and became a staple of the 2022 film festival circuit.\n\n**Reception**\n\n#### Box office\n\nThe Whale performed reasonably well at the box office, considering its limited release. The film grossed over $14 million worldwide, with a significant portion of that coming from the United States.\n\nWhile the film's box office performance was not spectacular, it was still a commercial success, given the low production budget and the film's limited release.\n\n#### Critical response\n\nThe Whale received widespread critical acclaim, with many reviewers praising Fraser's performance, Aronofsky's direction, and the film's emotional resonance.\n\nThe film holds a 92% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with many critics praising its nuanced and sensitive portrayal of a complex and often painful subject matter.\n\n#### Accolades\n\nThe Whale received several accolades, including the Grand Jury Prize at the 2022 Sundance Film Festival, where it premiered. The film also won the Audience Award at the 2022 Toronto International Film Festival.\n\nFraser's performance in the film earned him widespread critical acclaim, including several award nominations. He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role, among other honors.\n\n**See also**\n\n* List of films directed by Darren Aronofsky\n* List of films produced by Brendan Fraser\n* List of Sundance Film Festival award winners\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The Whale was the subject of controversy due to its sensitive subject matter and the film's depiction of a complex and often painful topic.\n* The film was praised for its nuanced and sensitive portrayal of a complex and often painful subject matter.\n* The film's cast and crew worked closely with local authorities to ensure that the film was shot safely and respectfully.\n\n**References**\n\nN/A\n\n**External links**\n\n* The Whale at IMDb\n* The Whale at Rotten Tomatoes\n* The Whale at Metacritic", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The season began on January 1, 2023, and ended on December 31, 2023. The season was part of the annual cycle of tropical cyclone formation in the Pacific Ocean, with the majority of storms forming in the western Pacific.\n\n**Seasonal Forecasts**\n\nPrior to the start of the season, several organizations, including the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) and the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA), issued forecasts for the number and intensity of typhoons that would form during the season.\n\nThe JMA predicted a slightly above-average number of typhoons, with 25-30 systems expected to form in the western Pacific. PAGASA forecasted a near-average number of typhoons, with 20-25 systems predicted to form in the region.\n\n**Seasonal Summary**\n\nThe 2023 Pacific typhoon season was characterized by several notable storms, including several intense typhoons and a few severe tropical storms.\n\n### Early Season Activity\n\nThe season began on January 1, 2023, with the formation of Tropical Depression Amang, a weak tropical depression that formed in the western Pacific. Amang was short-lived, dissipating on January 3.\n\nThe first named storm of the season was Tropical Storm Sanvu, which formed on February 10, 2023. Sanvu brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to the Marshall Islands, causing minor damage and power outages.\n\n### Peak Season Activity\n\nThe peak of the season occurred in June and July, with several intense typhoons forming in the western Pacific. These included Typhoon Mawar (Betty), which formed on June 20, 2023, and reached a peak intensity of 185 mph (295 km/h). Mawar brought catastrophic damage to the Philippines, with storm surges and flooding killing over 100 people.\n\nTyphoon Guchol (Chedeng) formed on June 25, 2023, and reached a peak intensity of 175 mph (282 km/h). Guchol brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to Japan, causing widespread damage and power outages.\n\nSevere Tropical Storm Talim (Dodong) formed on July 5, 2023, and reached a peak intensity of 120 mph (193 km/h).

The film is released by Walt Disney Pictures and is the first film to use Disney's proprietary animation engine, Hyperion.\n\nPlot\n\nThe story revolves around Ember, a fire spirit who lives in a world where emotions have physical forms. Ember's world, known as Elementia, is a city where fire, water, land, and air coexist in harmony. However, tensions arise between the elemental communities due to their differing natures and ways of life. Ember's home, the Fire District, is plagued by the encroaching darkness, which threatens to engulf the city.\n\nEmber meets Wade, a water spirit who is struggling to find his place in the world. The two form an unlikely friendship, which blossoms into romance. As they spend more time together, they realize that their love is forbidden due to their elemental differences. The Elemental Council, a group of elder spirits who govern Elementia, prohibits relationships between fire and water spirits, fearing it will disrupt the balance of the city.\n\nThe story takes a dramatic turn when Ember and Wade are forced to flee the Fire District and navigate the city's treacherous landscapes to reach the safety of the Water District. Along the way, they encounter a cast of colorful characters, each with their own unique abilities and struggles. The duo's journey is filled with action, humor, and heart, as they confront the darkness threatening their world and the prejudices that have long divided the elemental communities.\n\nVoice cast\n\n* Leah Lewis as Ember\n* Mamoudou Athie as Wade\n* Wiz Khalifa as Balthazar\n* Emily Ng as Ember's mother\n* Ronnie del Carmen as the Elemental Councilor\n* John Ratzenberger as the Mayor\n* Kaitlyn Dias as Ember's sister\n\nProduction\n\n### Development\n\nElemental was first announced in 2020, with Pete Docter and Kemp Powers set to direct the film. The project was initially titled \"Element\" and was described as a \"love story between a fire and a water spirit.\" The film's development was marked by a significant departure from traditional animation techniques, with the use of Disney's Hyperion engine allowing for greater control over character design and animation.\n\n### Writing\n\nThe screenplay was written by Pete Docter, Kemp Powers, and Megan Schubert. The story underwent significant changes during production, with the filmmakers incorporating elements of fantasy and adventure to create a more dynamic narrative. The film's script was influenced by the works of Hayao Miyazaki and other Japanese animators, who are known for their emphasis on environmentalism and social commentary.\n\n### Casting\n\nThe voice cast for Elemental was assembled by a team of casting directors who scoured the globe for talented actors. Leah Lewis, a rising star from the film \"To All the Boys I've Loved Before,\" was cast as Ember, while Mamoudou Athie, known for his roles in \"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\" and \"The Get Down,\" was cast as Wade.\n\n### Inspiration\n\nThe film's world and characters were inspired by a range of sources, including mythology, folklore, and environmentalism. The elemental communities were designed to reflect the unique characteristics of each element, with fire spirits being depicted as passionate and energetic, while water spirits were shown to be calm and introspective.\n\n### Animation and design\n\nElemental features a unique animation style that blends traditional techniques with cutting-edge computer-generated imagery. The film's characters and environments were designed by a team of artists who worked closely with the directors to bring the world of Elementia to life. The animation engine used in the film allows for greater control over character movement and emotion, creating a more immersive experience for the viewer.\n\nMusic\n\nThe music for Elemental was composed by a team of musicians who drew inspiration from a range of sources, including jazz, pop, and electronic music. The film's soundtrack features a range of original songs, including the hit single \"Spark,\" which was released in anticipation of the film's premiere.\n\nRelease\n\n### Marketing\n\nThe marketing campaign for Elemental was extensive, with Disney releasing a series of trailers and promotional materials in the months leading up to the film's premiere. The film's trailer was a surprise hit, generating millions of views on social media and building anticipation for the film's release.\n\n### Streaming and home media\n\nElemental was released in theaters on November 22, 2023, and was later made available for streaming on Disney+ and DVD. The film's home media release includes a range of special features, including deleted scenes, behind-the-scenes footage, and a commentary track by the directors.\n\nReception\n\n### Box office\n\nElemental was a commercial success, grossing over $500 million at the box office worldwide. The film's opening weekend was a major success, with the film debuting at number one in the US box office charts.\n\n### Critical response\n\nThe critical response to Elemental was overwhelmingly positive, with many critics praising the film's unique animation style, engaging storyline, and memorable characters. The film holds a 95% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with many critics noting its attention to environmentalism and social commentary.\n\n### Accolades\n\nElemental won several awards, including the BAFTA Award for Best Animated Film and the Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Animated Feature. The film was also nominated for several other awards, including the Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film.\n\nNotes\n\nElemental is a significant departure from traditional animation techniques, using Disney's Hyperion engine to create a unique and immersive experience.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n* Official website\n* Elemental at IMDb\n* Elemental at Rotten Tomatoes\n* Elemental at Metacritic", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The shortage was caused by a combination of factors, including supply chain issues, a recall and plant shutdown at a major manufacturing facility, import restrictions, and market concentration.\n\nCauses\n\n### Supply Chain Issues\n\nThe infant formula supply chain has been complex and vulnerable to disruptions for several years. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated existing supply chain issues, such as shortages of raw materials, transportation bottlenecks, and labor shortages. As a result, infant formula manufacturers experienced increased costs, reduced production capacity, and difficulties in meeting demand.\n\n### Recall and Plant Shutdown\n\nIn February 2022, Abbott Nutrition, one of the largest infant formula manufacturers in the United States, announced a voluntary recall of its Similac, Alimentum, and EleCare powdered infant formulas due to contamination concerns. The recall was prompted by reports of bacterial contamination in four batches of formula produced at Abbott's Sturgis, Michigan plant. The plant was subsequently shut down for cleaning and sanitization.\n\n#### Alleged Problems at Sturgis Plant\n\nInvestigations into the Sturgis plant's operations revealed alleged problems with quality control, including inadequate cleaning and sanitizing procedures, and inadequate testing of finished products. The plant's employees reported feeling pressured to meet high production targets, which may have contributed to the contamination issues.\n\n### Import Restrictions\n\nThe infant formula shortage was also exacerbated by import restrictions imposed by the U.S. government. In 2020, the Trump administration imposed tariffs on infant formula imports from several countries, including Mexico and China, in an effort to protect domestic manufacturers. The tariffs increased the cost of imported formula and reduced the availability of alternative sources.\n\n### Market Concentration\n\nThe infant formula market is highly concentrated, with a few large manufacturers controlling a significant portion of the market. This concentration has led to reduced competition, higher prices, and decreased innovation.\n\nEffects\n\n### Sale and Donation of Breast Milk\n\nAs a result of the shortage, many parents turned to alternative sources of nutrition for their infants. Some began selling or donating breast milk, either through online platforms or local milk banks. This helped to alleviate the shortage, but also raised concerns about the safety and regulation of breast milk banking.\n\n### Use of Alternative Foods\n\nOther parents opted for alternative foods, such as cow's milk or goat's milk, which are not nutritionally equivalent to infant formula. This can lead to nutritional deficiencies and other health problems if not properly managed.\n\n### Hospitalizations\n\nThe infant formula shortage led to an increase in hospitalizations related to infant nutrition. Some infants experienced severe malnutrition, dehydration, or other health problems due to inadequate nutrition.\n\n### Bot Usage\n\nThe shortage also led to an increase in bot usage, as parents and caregivers turned to online forums and social media to seek advice and support. While bot usage can provide valuable information and community support, it can also spread misinformation and create confusion.\n\n### Shortage in Canada\n\nThe infant formula shortage had a ripple effect in Canada, where many of the same manufacturers supply formula to both countries. The shortage led to increased demand for imported formula, which exacerbated existing supply chain issues.\n\nResponses\n\n### Efforts to Prevent Price Gouging\n\nThe U.S. government implemented measures to prevent price gouging during the shortage. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) launched an investigation into price increases by several infant formula manufacturers, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) worked to reduce price inflation.\n\n### Efforts to Increase Supply\n\nThe U.S. government also took steps to increase the supply of infant formula. The USDA worked with domestic manufacturers to increase production, and the FDA expedited the approval process for imported formula.\n\n### Efforts to Restore Production\n\nAbbott Nutrition, the manufacturer that had shut down the Sturgis plant, worked to restore production. The company implemented new quality control measures and invested in additional equipment to ensure the safety and quality of its products.\n\n### Investigations\n\nSeveral investigations were launched to examine the causes of the shortage and the response of the government and manufacturers. These investigations included:\n\n#### Congressional Investigation\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Reform launched an investigation into the shortage, focusing on the role of government agencies, manufacturers, and distributors.\n\n#### FDA Investigation\n\nThe FDA launched an investigation into the contamination concerns at the Sturgis plant, which led to the recall and shutdown.\n\n#### ABC News Investigation\n\nABC News conducted an investigation into the shortage, which revealed alleged problems with quality control and inadequate testing at Abbott's plant.\n\n#### DOJ Investigation\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) launched an investigation into price gouging and potential antitrust violations by several infant formula manufacturers.\n\nCommentary\n\n### Breast Milk vs. Formula Debate\n\nThe infant formula shortage reignited the debate about breast milk versus formula as the preferred source of nutrition for infants.

Born in the United States, Young's swimming career spanned over two decades, during which he captivated audiences with his impressive endurance and determination. This article explores Young's early swimming achievements, his most notable swims, and his inconsistent yet remarkable career, ultimately leading to his retirement and late professional life.\n\nEarly Swimming Achievements\n\nYoung's early life and swimming experiences laid the foundation for his future success. His training under the guidance of renowned coaches and his exposure to the challenging waters of the Pacific Ocean played a significant role in shaping his skills and mental toughness.\n\n### Catalina Swim Training\n\nYoung's training in the waters surrounding Catalina Island, off the coast of California, was instrumental in developing his swimming technique and endurance. The unique combination of currents, tides, and ocean conditions of Catalina presented Young with a challenging yet rewarding environment to hone his skills. His extensive training sessions in these waters allowed him to adapt to the unpredictable and often unforgiving conditions, ultimately contributing to his growth as a swimmer.\n\n### Catalina Channel Swim\n\nThe Catalina Channel Swim, a 21-mile (34 km) stretch of water separating Catalina Island from the California mainland, was a significant milestone in Young's swimming career. This swim, considered one of the most challenging open-water swims in the world, pushed Young to his limits, testing his physical and mental endurance.\n\n#### Swam with Tides\n\nYoung's approach to swimming with the tides in the Catalina Channel was a crucial factor in his success. He carefully planned his swims to coincide with favorable tidal conditions, using the currents to his advantage. This strategic approach allowed Young to conserve energy and make the most of his physical abilities, ultimately enabling him to complete the swim.\n\n#### Competition from Norman Ross\n\nNorman Ross, a fellow American swimmer, was a notable competitor in the early 20th century. Their rivalry, particularly in the Catalina Channel Swim, fueled Young's determination and pushed him to excel. Ross's impressive swimming career served as a constant reminder of the high standards Young aimed to achieve, driving him to continually improve his skills.\n\n#### Public Acclaim, with Limited Financial Gain\n\nDespite his remarkable achievements, Young's swimming career was marked by limited financial rewards. His focus on the sport was driven by a passion for swimming rather than financial gain. Young's dedication to his craft, however, earned him widespread recognition and admiration from the public, who were captivated by his impressive endurance and determination.\n\nInconsistent Swimming Career\n\nYoung's swimming career was characterized by a mix of remarkable achievements and periods of inactivity. His inconsistent schedule and focus on other pursuits, such as marriage and family life, influenced his swimming career, leading to a series of notable swims interspersed with periods of inactivity.\n\n### 1927, 21-Mile Lake Ontario Swim\n\nYoung's 21-mile (34 km) swim across Lake Ontario in 1927 was a notable achievement, showcasing his endurance and skill in open-water swimming. This swim, completed in a remarkable time, demonstrated Young's ability to adapt to challenging conditions and push his limits.\n\n### 1928, 15-Mile Lake Ontario Swim\n\nYoung's 15-mile (24 km) swim across Lake Ontario in 1928 was another impressive feat, highlighting his consistency and endurance. This swim, completed in a respectable time, solidified Young's position as a leading long-distance swimmer.\n\n### Wins Sept 1928 Montreal to Repentigney Marathon\n\nYoung's victory in the 1928 Montreal to Repentigney Marathon, a 44-mile (71 km) swim, was a significant achievement, demonstrating his exceptional endurance and skill. This marathon swim, completed in a remarkable time, cemented Young's reputation as a leading long-distance swimmer.\n\n### 1929, 15-mile Lake Ontario swim\n\nYoung's 15-mile (24 km) swim across Lake Ontario in 1929 was another notable achievement, showcasing his consistency and endurance. This swim, completed in a respectable time, solidified Young's position as a leading long-distance swimmer.\n\n### 1930, 15-mile Lake Ontario swim\n\nYoung's 15-mile (24 km) swim across Lake Ontario in 1930 was another impressive feat, highlighting his ability to adapt to challenging conditions and push his limits. This swim, completed in a respectable time, solidified Young's position as a leading long-distance swimmer.\n\n### Wins 1931 Lake Ontario win\n\nYoung's victory in the 1931 Lake Ontario swim was a significant achievement, demonstrating his exceptional endurance and skill. This swim, completed in a remarkable time, cemented Young's reputation as a leading long-distance swimmer.\n\nLate Swim Career\n\nYoung's late swimming career was marked by a mix of notable achievements and periods of inactivity. His focus on other pursuits, such as family life and business, influenced his swimming career, leading to a series of notable swims interspersed with periods of inactivity.\n\nSwim Retirement and Marriage\n\nYoung's decision to retire from competitive swimming was driven by a combination of factors, including the demands of family life and the changing landscape of the sport. His retirement from competitive swimming marked the end of an era, as he transitioned to a new phase of his life, focusing on his family and other pursuits.\n\n### Marriages\n\nYoung's personal life was marked by two marriages, each bringing new challenges and opportunities. His first marriage, to a woman who shared his passion for swimming, was a happy and fulfilling partnership, while his second marriage, to a woman who was not as supportive of his swimming career, presented new challenges.\n\nLate Professional Life\n\nAfter retiring from competitive swimming, Young transitioned to a new phase of his life, focusing on his family and other pursuits. He pursued a career in business, leveraging his skills and experience to succeed in a new field. Young's late professional life was marked by a mix of success and challenges, as he navigated the demands of his new career.\n\nHonors\n\nYoung's contributions to the world of swimming earned him numerous honors and accolades. His remarkable achievements in the sport, coupled with his dedication and perseverance, solidified his position as a leading figure in the world of long-distance swimming.\n\nSee also\n\n* List of long-distance swimmers\n* Swimming at the 1928 Summer Olympics\n* Catalina Channel Swim\n* Lake Ontario\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n* George Young's profile at the International Swimming Hall of Fame", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

In April 2022, Elon Musk, the CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, announced his intention to acquire Twitter for $44 billion. The acquisition was met with widespread interest and scrutiny, with many experts and analysts weighing in on its potential implications.\n\n**Prelude**\n\n### Background\n\nTwitter was founded by Jack Dorsey, Evan Williams, Biz Stone, and Noah Glass in 2006. The platform quickly gained popularity, and by 2013, it had become a major player in the social media landscape. Twitter's user base continued to grow, with the platform adding over 100 million new users in 2020 alone.\n\n### Early developments\n\nIn the years leading up to the acquisition, Twitter had faced increasing competition from other social media platforms, including Facebook and Instagram. The company had also struggled with issues related to user growth, advertising revenue, and content moderation. Despite these challenges, Twitter remained a significant player in the social media landscape.\n\n**Buyout offer**\n\nOn April 4, 2022, Elon Musk announced that he had acquired a 9.2% stake in Twitter, making him the company's largest shareholder. The move was seen as a major development in the world of social media, with many experts speculating about Musk's intentions.\n\n### Takeover bid\n\nOn April 14, 2022, Musk announced that he had launched a takeover bid for Twitter, offering to buy the company for $54.20 per share, or a total of $44 billion.

The move was seen as a major U-turn by Musk, who had previously expressed his intention to terminate the takeover bid.\n\n### Attempted withdrawal by Musk\n\nOn June 15, 2022, Musk announced that he was withdrawing his takeover bid for Twitter, citing a lack of transparency over the company's handling of spam and fake accounts. The move was seen as a major development in the world of social media, with many experts weighing in on the potential implications of the withdrawal.\n\n**Revival and closing**\n\nOn July 8, 2022, Musk announced that he was reviving his takeover bid for Twitter, stating that he was willing to proceed with the acquisition as long as the company's board of directors agreed to certain conditions.

The acquisition was seen as a major development in the world of social media, with many experts speculating about the potential implications of the deal.\n\n### Post-acquisition\n\nIn the months following the acquisition, Musk made several significant changes to Twitter, including the introduction of new policies and features.

These humans are led by a charismatic leader named Tonowari (Cliff Curtis), who is determined to bring his people to the planet and establish a new society.\n\nJake and his family must navigate the complexities of their relationships with the humans and the Na'vi, all while facing the challenges of their new life on Pandora. Along the way, Jake must also confront his own identity and the legacy of his past as a human.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Sam Worthington as Jake Sully\n* Zoe Saldana as Neytiri\n* Sigourney Weaver as Dr. Norma Spellman\n* Stephen Lang as Colonel Miles Quaritch\n* Cliff Curtis as Tonowari\n* Joel David Moore as Dr. Max Patel\n* CCH Pounder as Mo'at\n* Edie Falco as General Ardmore\n* Jemaine Clement as Dr. Ian Garvin\n\n**Themes and analysis**\n\nAvatar: The Way of Water explores a number of themes, including identity, community, and the relationship between humans and the natural world. Through the character of Jake Sully, the film explores the idea of identity and how it is shaped by our experiences and relationships. Jake's journey is also a metaphor for the journey of indigenous peoples around the world, who have faced colonialism and displacement.\n\nThe film also explores the theme of community and the importance of family and relationships in our lives. The Na'vi people are a close-knit community that values connection and cooperation, and Jake's family is at the center of the film's narrative.\n\nFinally, the film explores the theme of the relationship between humans and the natural world. The Na'vi people live in harmony with the natural world, and their connection to the land and the creatures that inhabit it is central to their culture and identity. The film suggests that humans have a responsibility to respect and care for the natural world, and that our actions have consequences for the planet and its inhabitants.\n\n**Production**\n\n### Development\n\nAvatar: The Way of Water was developed over a period of several years, with James Cameron working on the script and story.
