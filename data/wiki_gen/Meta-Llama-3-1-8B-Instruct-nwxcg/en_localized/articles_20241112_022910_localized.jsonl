The draft was held on April 28–30, 2022, at the Caesars Forum in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\n**Host city**\n\nThe 2022 NFL Draft was held at the Caesars Forum in Las Vegas, Nevada, marking the first time the draft was held in Las Vegas. The Caesars Forum is a 550,000-square-foot (51,000 m2) facility that features a large outdoor courtyard and a 100,000-square-foot (9,300 m2) indoor event space. The venue was chosen as the host of the 2022 NFL Draft in 2019, with the NFL citing its location and amenities as key factors in the decision.\n\n**Player selections**\n\nThe 2022 NFL Draft featured 259 selections across the seven rounds. The draft was televised nationally on the NFL Network, with ESPN and ABC also broadcasting coverage. The first round of the draft was held on Thursday, April 28, with the remaining rounds taking place on Friday, April 29, and Saturday, April 30.\n\nThe Cincinnati Bengals selected quarterback Joe Burrow with the first overall pick in the 2022 NFL Draft. Burrow, a product of Ohio State University, was the seventh overall pick in the 2020 NFL Draft but played only one season with the Bengals before suffering a season-ending injury. The Bengals had been searching for a quarterback to lead their team, and Burrow's selection was seen as a major coup for the franchise.\n\nThe Jacksonville Jaguars selected wide receiver Travon Walker with the second overall pick, while the Houston Texans selected quarterback C.J. Stroud with the third overall pick. The Philadelphia Eagles selected defensive tackle Jordan Davis with the 13th overall pick, while the Detroit Lions selected edge rusher Aidan Hutchinson with the 2nd overall pick.\n\n**Notable undrafted players**\n\nDespite the hype surrounding the top prospects in the 2022 NFL Draft, many talented players went undrafted. One notable example is running back James Cook, who was a consensus All-American at Georgia and was expected to be a second-round pick. However, he went undrafted and eventually signed with the Buffalo Bills as an undrafted free agent.\n\nOther notable undrafted players from the 2022 NFL Draft include quarterback Malik Cunningham, who was a Heisman Trophy finalist at Louisville, and defensive back Camryn Batch, who was a standout cornerback at North Carolina.\n\n**Trades**\n\nThe 2022 NFL Draft saw a number of trades take place throughout the seven rounds. One notable trade occurred on the second day of the draft, when the New England Patriots traded a 2022 third-round pick to the Philadelphia Eagles in exchange for wide receiver DeVonta Smith.\n\nThe Miami Dolphins traded a 2022 second-round pick to the San Francisco 49ers in exchange for wide receiver Deebo Samuel, while the Cleveland Browns traded a 2022 fourth-round pick to the New York Jets in exchange for defensive tackle Sheldon Rankins.\n\n**2020 Resolution JC-2A selections**\n\nThe 2022 NFL Draft saw the selection of several players who were previously selected in the 2020 NFL Draft but were not signed by their respective teams. One notable example is quarterback Joe Burrow, who was the first overall pick in the 2020 NFL Draft but suffered a season-ending injury and was released by the Cincinnati Bengals. Burrow was selected by the Bengals with the first overall pick in the 2022 NFL Draft, marking a major comeback for the quarterback.\n\nOther players who were previously selected in the 2020 NFL Draft but were not signed by their respective teams include quarterback Jordan Love, who was selected by the Green Bay Packers with the 26th overall pick, and linebacker Patrick Taylor, who was selected by the Dallas Cowboys with the 124th overall pick.\n\n**Notes**\n\nThe 2022 NFL Draft was the first time the draft was held in Las Vegas, with the city's Caesars Forum serving as the venue for the event. The draft saw a number of trades take place, with multiple teams swapping picks throughout the seven rounds.\n\nThe 2022 NFL Draft also saw the selection of several players who were previously selected in the 2020 NFL Draft but were not signed by their respective teams. These players, including quarterback Joe Burrow and linebacker Patrick Taylor, marked a major comeback for the players and their respective teams.\n\n**Summary**\n\nThe 2022 NFL Draft saw the selection of 259 players across the seven rounds, with the Cincinnati Bengals selecting quarterback Joe Burrow with the first overall pick. The draft saw a number of trades take place, with multiple teams swapping picks throughout the seven rounds.\n\nThe 2022 NFL Draft also saw the selection of several players who were previously selected in the 2020 NFL Draft but were not signed by their respective teams. These players, including quarterback Joe Burrow and linebacker Patrick Taylor, marked a major comeback for the players and their respective teams.\n\n**Selections by NCAA conference**\n\nThe 2022 NFL Draft saw the selection of players from several NCAA conferences, with the Southeastern Conference (SEC) leading the way with 60 selections. The Big 12 Conference followed with 34 selections, while the Pac-12 Conference had 25 selections.\n\nThe Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) had 23 selections, while the Big Ten Conference had 22 selections. The American Athletic Conference (AAC) had 10 selections, while the Mid-American Conference (MAC) had 6 selections.\n\n**Colleges with multiple draft selections**\n\nThe 2022 NFL Draft saw the selection of multiple players from several colleges, with the University of Alabama leading the way with 7 selections.

The storm was the eighth named storm, the fifth hurricane, and the third major hurricane of the 2022 Atlantic hurricane season.\n\n# Meteorological History\n\nHurricane Fiona formed on September 14, 2022, from a tropical wave that moved off the coast of Africa. The system quickly developed into a tropical depression, and later, a tropical storm, as it moved westward across the Atlantic. The storm strengthened rapidly, reaching hurricane strength on September 15, and eventually, major hurricane strength on September 17.\n\nFiona's formation was influenced by a strong subtropical ridge that extended from the eastern United States to the western Atlantic. The ridge allowed the storm to move westward, away from the subtropical steering currents, and into a region of low wind shear and high sea surface temperatures. The storm's track was also influenced by a mid-latitude trough that formed over the eastern United States, which eventually interacted with Fiona and steered it northward towards the Caribbean.\n\n# Preparations\n\nAs Fiona formed, forecasters predicted that the storm would intensify and impact the Caribbean, prompting governments to issue warnings and advisories. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) issued a hurricane watch for the Leeward Islands, and a tropical storm watch for the Windward Islands.\n\nGovernments in the affected areas took steps to prepare for the storm. In Guadeloupe, the government declared a state of emergency and ordered evacuations in low-lying areas. In Puerto Rico, the government activated its emergency operations center and deployed personnel to areas expected to be affected by the storm.\n\n## Guadeloupe\n\nOn September 16, 2022, the government of Guadeloupe issued a hurricane warning for the island, and residents were advised to seek shelter in secure buildings. The island's international airport was closed, and ferry services were suspended.\n\n## Puerto Rico\n\nOn September 17, 2022, the government of Puerto Rico issued a hurricane warning for the island, and residents were advised to seek shelter in secure buildings. The island's international airport was closed, and ferry services were suspended.\n\n## Dominican Republic\n\nOn September 18, 2022, the government of the Dominican Republic issued a hurricane warning for the island's northern coast, and residents were advised to seek shelter in secure buildings. The island's international airport was closed, and ferry services were suspended.\n\n## Turks and Caicos\n\nOn September 18, 2022, the government of the Turks and Caicos Islands issued a hurricane warning for the islands, and residents were advised to seek shelter in secure buildings. The island's international airport was closed, and ferry services were suspended.\n\n## Antigua\n\nOn September 18, 2022, the government of Antigua and Barbuda issued a hurricane warning for the islands, and residents were advised to seek shelter in secure buildings. The island's international airport was closed, and ferry services were suspended.\n\n## Bermuda\n\nOn September 19, 2022, the government of Bermuda issued a hurricane watch for the island, and residents were advised to prepare for the storm. The island's international airport was closed, and ferry services were suspended.\n\n## Eastern Canada\n\nOn September 21, 2022, the government of Canada issued a hurricane warning for the eastern provinces, and residents were advised to seek shelter in secure buildings. The Canadian government also deployed military personnel to assist with evacuations and emergency response efforts.\n\n# Impact\n\nFiona made landfall in Guadeloupe on September 16, 2022, as a Category 4 hurricane, with sustained winds of 140 mph (225 km/h) and storm surge of up to 10 feet (3 meters). The storm caused widespread damage and flooding on the island, including the destruction of homes and businesses.\n\n## Guadeloupe\n\nThe storm caused an estimated $500 million in damage on Guadeloupe, and left thousands of people homeless. The island's infrastructure was severely damaged, including roads, bridges, and power lines.\n\n## Puerto Rico\n\nFiona made landfall in Puerto Rico on September 17, 2022, as a Category 3 hurricane, with sustained winds of 120 mph (195 km/h) and storm surge of up to 6 feet (2 meters). The storm caused widespread damage and flooding on the island, including the destruction of homes and businesses.\n\n## Dominican Republic\n\nFiona made landfall in the Dominican Republic on September 18, 2022, as a Category 2 hurricane, with sustained winds of 100 mph (155 km/h) and storm surge of up to 5 feet (2 meters). The storm caused widespread damage and flooding on the island, including the destruction of homes and businesses.\n\n## Turks and Caicos\n\nFiona made landfall in the Turks and Caicos Islands on September 18, 2022, as a Category 3 hurricane, with sustained winds of 120 mph (195 km/h) and storm surge of up to 8 feet (3 meters).

The album marks a new era in Swift's music, exploring themes of introspection, self-discovery, and emotional growth. With Midnights, Swift continues to push the boundaries of her artistry, experimenting with new sounds and styles while maintaining her signature songwriting voice.\n\n**#Background**\n\nMidnights was written during a period of significant personal and professional change for Swift. In the years leading up to the album's release, Swift had experienced a highly publicized feud with Scooter Braun and Scott Borchetta, resulting in a highly publicized dispute over the ownership of her master recordings. Swift had also announced her engagement to actor Joe Alwyn, with whom she had been in a long-term relationship. These experiences served as a catalyst for the introspection and self-discovery that would shape the narrative of Midnights.\n\n**#Concept and writing**\n\n**##Themes**\n\nThe concept of Midnights revolves around the idea of exploring one's inner world, examining the complexities of the human experience, and confronting the fears and doubts that often accompany personal growth. Swift has described the album as a \"sacred record\" that captures the moments of \"midnight madness\" – the times when she feels most vulnerable, anxious, and unsure of herself. Through Midnights, Swift invites listeners to join her on a journey of self-discovery, encouraging them to confront their own fears and doubts, and to find solace in the darkness.\n\n**#Production and music**\n\nMidnights was produced by Jack Antonoff, who had previously collaborated with Swift on her 2019 album, Lover. Antonoff brought a new level of experimentation to the production, incorporating elements of electronic music, hip-hop, and indie rock. Swift has said that she was drawn to Antonoff's approach, which allowed her to push the boundaries of her songwriting and explore new sounds. The album features a range of instrumental textures, from the minimalist piano-driven balladry of \"Lavender Haze\" to the driving electronic beats of \"Anti-Hero.\"\n\n**#Artwork and aesthetics**\n\nThe cover art for Midnights features a striking image of Swift in a dark, minimalist setting, surrounded by candles and a faint glow. The artwork was designed by Swift herself, who wanted to create a visual representation of the album's themes of introspection and self-discovery. The aesthetic of the album is characterized by its use of dark colors, bold typography, and abstract imagery, which reflects Swift's desire to create a sense of mystery and intrigue.\n\n**#Release and promotion**\n\nMidnights was released on October 21, 2022, in conjunction with a special \"midnight\" edition of the album, which included exclusive merchandise and a limited-edition CD. Swift promoted the album through a series of social media posts and interviews, in which she discussed the album's themes and inspirations. The album's release was accompanied by a string of high-profile performances, including a surprise appearance at the 2022 Grammy Awards and a sold-out show at the Los Angeles Staples Center.\n\n**#Commercial performance**\n\nMidnights debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling over 1.2 million copies in its first week. The album has been certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and has broken multiple streaming records, including the most-streamed album in a single day on Spotify. Worldwide, Midnights has sold over 5 million copies and has been certified multi-platinum in several countries.\n\n**#Critical reception**\n\n**##Rankings**\n\nMidnights has received widespread critical acclaim, with many praising Swift's songwriting and the album's thematic cohesion. Rolling Stone described the album as \"a deeply personal and emotionally raw\" work, while The New York Times praised Swift's ability to \"craft songs that are both deeply personal and universally relatable.\" The album has been included on several year-end lists, including Rolling Stone's \"50 Best Albums of 2022\" and The New York Times' \"Best Albums of 2022.\"\n\n**#Awards**\n\nMidnights has been nominated for several awards, including the 2023 Grammy Awards for Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album. Swift has won several awards for the album, including the 2022 MTV Video Music Award for Best Pop Video for \"Anti-Hero.\"\n\n**#Impact**\n\nMidnights has had a significant impact on the music industry, inspiring a new generation of artists to explore themes of introspection and self-discovery. The album's success has also paved the way for Swift to continue pushing the boundaries of her artistry, experimenting with new sounds and styles while maintaining her signature songwriting voice.\n\n**#Track listing**\n\n1. \"Lavender Haze\"\n2. \"Maroon\"\n3. \"Anti-Hero\"\n4. \"Snow on the Beach\" (feat.

The storm caused significant damage and disruption to communities in Melanesia, Norfolk Island, and New Zealand, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake.\n\n# Meteorological History\n\nCyclone Gabrielle formed as a tropical disturbance in the Coral Sea on February 2, 2023. The system gradually intensified as it moved westward, eventually developing into a tropical cyclone on February 4. The storm continued to strengthen, reaching category 3 strength on the Australian Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale by February 6. Over the next two days, Gabrielle maintained its intensity, causing widespread damage and disruption in the region.\n\n## Formation and Intensification\n\n Gabrielle formed in a region of low pressure in the Coral Sea, an area prone to tropical cyclone activity. The system was initially characterized by a loose circulation and disorganized convection. However, as it moved westward, the system began to consolidate, and the convection became more organized. By February 4, Gabrielle had developed a well-defined eye and a symmetric cloud pattern, indicating a strengthening storm.\n\n## Track and Intensity\n\n Gabrielle's track was influenced by the trade winds, which steered the storm westward towards the Solomon Islands. The storm continued to intensify, reaching category 3 strength on February 6. The storm's central pressure dropped to 950 hPa, and the maximum sustained winds reached 150 km/h. Over the next 24 hours, Gabrielle maintained its intensity, causing widespread damage and disruption in the region.\n\n# Effects\n\nCyclone Gabrielle caused significant damage and disruption to communities in Melanesia, Norfolk Island, and New Zealand.\n\n## Melanesia\n\nIn the Solomon Islands, Gabrielle caused widespread damage to homes and infrastructure, leaving many people without access to basic necessities. The storm also disrupted communication and transportation networks, making it difficult for aid to reach affected areas.\n\n## Norfolk Island\n\nIn Norfolk Island, Gabrielle caused significant damage to homes and infrastructure, including the island's power grid. The storm also disrupted communication and transportation networks, leaving many residents without access to basic necessities.\n\n## New Zealand\n\nGabrielle made landfall in New Zealand on February 14, bringing widespread rain and strong winds to the eastern regions of the North Island. The storm caused significant damage to homes and infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and communications networks.\n\n### Northland\n\nIn Northland, Gabrielle caused widespread damage to homes and infrastructure, including the region's power grid. The storm also disrupted communication and transportation networks, leaving many residents without access to basic necessities.\n\n### Auckland\n\nIn Auckland, Gabrielle caused significant damage to homes and infrastructure, including the region's power grid. The storm also disrupted communication and transportation networks, leaving many residents without access to basic necessities.\n\n### Waikato\n\nIn Waikato, Gabrielle caused widespread damage to homes and infrastructure, including the region's power grid. The storm also disrupted communication and transportation networks, leaving many residents without access to basic necessities.\n\n### Gisborne\n\nIn Gisborne, Gabrielle caused significant damage to homes and infrastructure, including the region's power grid. The storm also disrupted communication and transportation networks, leaving many residents without access to basic necessities.\n\n### Hawke's Bay\n\nIn Hawke's Bay, Gabrielle caused widespread damage to homes and infrastructure, including the region's power grid. The storm also disrupted communication and transportation networks, leaving many residents without access to basic necessities.\n\n### Manawatū-Whanganui\n\nIn Manawatū-Whanganui, Gabrielle caused significant damage to homes and infrastructure, including the region's power grid. The storm also disrupted communication and transportation networks, leaving many residents without access to basic necessities.\n\n### Other regions\n\nIn other regions of New Zealand, Gabrielle caused significant damage to homes and infrastructure, including the region's power grid. The storm also disrupted communication and transportation networks, leaving many residents without access to basic necessities.\n\n# Responses\n\nThe response to Cyclone Gabrielle was coordinated by various agencies and organizations in New Zealand.\n\n## New Zealand\n\nThe New Zealand government declared a state of emergency in response to Gabrielle's impact. The government also deployed military personnel and equipment to assist with relief efforts.\n\n### Relief\n\nThe New Zealand Red Cross and other humanitarian organizations provided relief supplies, including food, water, and shelter, to affected communities. The organizations also provided emotional support and counseling to those affected by the storm.\n\n### Government\n\nThe New Zealand government provided financial assistance to affected communities, including grants and loans to help with rebuilding and recovery efforts.\n\n### Civil society\n\nCivil society organizations, including community groups and charities, played a significant role in responding to Gabrielle's impact. These organizations provided relief supplies, including food, water, and shelter, to affected communities.\n\n### Inquiries\n\nAn inquiry into the response to Gabrielle was conducted by the New Zealand government. The inquiry was established to investigate the effectiveness of the response to the storm and to identify areas for improvement.\n\n### Managed retreat\n\nThe managed retreat of coastal communities was a topic of debate in the aftermath of Gabrielle. The storm highlighted the risks associated with coastal development and the need for managed retreat in areas prone to flooding and erosion.\n\n# Retirement\n\nCyclone Gabrielle was retired from the list of Pacific cyclone names by the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat in recognition of the significant damage and disruption it caused. The name was replaced by a new name for future storms.\n\n# See also\n\n* Cyclone season in the South Pacific\n* List of Pacific cyclones\n* Tropical cyclones in New Zealand\n\n# References\n\n(Note: This section is not included as per the requirements)\n\n# External links\n\n* New Zealand MetService: Cyclone Gabrielle\n* Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat: Retired Pacific cyclone names\n* New Zealand Red Cross: Cyclone Gabrielle response", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

Bagley\n\nTennent Henry Bagley Jr. is a former American intelligence officer and author, best known for his work on the analysis of the KGB-CIA war during the Cold War era. Bagley's experiences and insights into the world of espionage have been widely read and discussed in the realm of intelligence studies.\n\n#Early Life and Education\n\nTennent Bagley was born on March 22, 1921, in New York City. His family had a long tradition of public service, with his father serving as a diplomat in the United States Foreign Service. Bagley's early life was shaped by the tumultuous years of the Great Depression and World War II. He grew up in a household that valued education and encouraged his interest in history and politics.\n\nBagley attended the prestigious Groton School, where he developed a strong foundation in languages, including Russian and German. He then went on to study at Yale University, where he earned a degree in history. Bagley's academic pursuits were interrupted by World War II, during which he enlisted in the United States Marine Corps.\n\n#Career\n\nAfter the war, Bagley joined the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in 1947, where he began working in the Directorate of Intelligence. He quickly rose through the ranks, becoming one of the agency's leading experts on the Soviet Union. Bagley's work took him to various parts of the world, including Eastern Europe, where he developed close relationships with local intelligence officers and politicians.\n\nBagley played a key role in the CIA's analysis of the KGB, the Soviet Union's security agency. He was instrumental in identifying the KGB's various methods and tactics, including the use of double agents and moles within the CIA. Bagley's work on the KGB-CIA war has been widely studied and admired by intelligence professionals.\n\n#Bagley's Analysis of the KGB-CIA War\n\nBagley's analysis of the KGB-CIA war was groundbreaking, as it provided a detailed understanding of the Soviet Union's intelligence operations. He identified the KGB's use of double agents, such as Kim Philby, a British agent who had defected to the Soviet Union, and George Blake, a Dutch agent who had also defected. Bagley also highlighted the KGB's use of moles within the CIA, such as Aldrich Ames and Robert Hanssen, who would later become infamous for their treason.\n\nBagley's work on the KGB-CIA war has been praised for its depth and accuracy. He has been credited with helping to shape the CIA's understanding of the Soviet Union's intelligence capabilities and vulnerabilities. His analysis has also been widely read and studied by intelligence professionals and scholars.\n\n#The Popov Case\n\nOne of the most notable cases that Bagley worked on was the Popov case, which involved the defection of a high-ranking KGB officer, Ivan Popov. Popov had been a key figure in the KGB's operations in Eastern Europe and had defected to the CIA in 1953. Bagley played a key role in debriefing Popov and extracting intelligence from him.\n\nThe Popov case was significant, as it provided the CIA with valuable insights into the KGB's operations and methods. It also highlighted the KGB's use of double agents and moles within the CIA. Bagley's work on the Popov case has been widely praised, as it helped to shape the CIA's understanding of the KGB's capabilities and vulnerabilities.\n\n#The Golienewski Case\n\nAnother notable case that Bagley worked on was the Golienewski case, which involved the defection of a high-ranking KGB officer, Richard Golienewski. Golienewski had been a key figure in the KGB's operations in Germany and had defected to the CIA in 1958. Bagley played a key role in debriefing Golienewski and extracting intelligence from him.\n\nThe Golienewski case was significant, as it provided the CIA with valuable insights into the KGB's operations and methods. It also highlighted the KGB's use of double agents and moles within the CIA. Bagley's work on the Golienewski case has been widely praised, as it helped to shape the CIA's understanding of the KGB's capabilities and vulnerabilities.\n\n#The Nosenko Case\n\nOne of the most infamous cases that Bagley worked on was the Nosenko case, which involved the defection of a high-ranking KGB officer, Yuri Nosenko. Nosenko had been a key figure in the KGB's operations in the Soviet Union and had defected to the CIA in 1962. Bagley played a key role in debriefing Nosenko and extracting intelligence from him.\n\nThe Nosenko case was significant, as it highlighted the KGB's use of double agents and moles within the CIA. It also raised questions about the CIA's handling of Nosenko, who was suspected of being a KGB plant. Bagley's work on the Nosenko case has been widely praised, as it helped to shape the CIA's understanding of the KGB's capabilities and vulnerabilities.\n\n#Nosenko and the \"Zepp\" Incident\n\nOne of the most notable incidents that occurred during the Nosenko case was the \"Zepp\" incident, which involved a KGB plot to discredit Nosenko and the CIA. The KGB had created a fake document, known as the \"Zepp\" document, which suggested that Nosenko was a KGB plant. Bagley was instrumental in uncovering the truth behind the \"Zepp\" incident, which helped to clear Nosenko's name and restore his credibility.\n\n#More Nosenko\n\nThe Nosenko case was a complex and drawn-out affair, with Bagley playing a key role in the CIA's efforts to extract intelligence from Nosenko. Despite the challenges and setbacks, Bagley remained committed to understanding the KGB's operations and methods. His work on the Nosenko case has been widely praised, as it helped to shape the CIA's understanding of the KGB's capabilities and vulnerabilities.\n\n#The KITTY HAWK / Shadrin Case\n\nAnother notable case that Bagley worked on was the KITTY HAWK / Shadrin case, which involved the defection of a high-ranking KGB officer, Nikolai Shadrin. Shadrin had been a key figure in the KGB's operations in Eastern Europe and had defected to the CIA in 1964. Bagley played a key role in debriefing Shadrin and extracting intelligence from him.\n\nThe KITTY HAWK / Shadrin case was significant, as it provided the CIA with valuable insights into the KGB's operations and methods. It also highlighted the KGB's use of double agents and moles within the CIA. Bagley's work on the KITTY HAWK / Shadrin case has been widely praised, as it helped to shape the CIA's understanding of the KGB's capabilities and vulnerabilities.\n\n#Rebuttal to John L. Hart's HSCA testimony\n\nIn 1976, John L. Hart, a former CIA officer, testified before the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) that Bagley had been involved in a plot to assassinate Fidel Castro in 1960. Bagley vigorously denied these allegations, stating that he had been on leave at the time and had no involvement in any such plot. Bagley's rebuttal was widely praised, as it helped to clear his name and restore his credibility.\n\n#Reactions to his Spy Wars book\n\nBagley's book, \"Spy Wars: Moles, Mysteries, and Deadly Games,\" was widely praised by intelligence professionals and scholars. The book provided a detailed and insightful look at the world of espionage, including the KGB-CIA war. Bagley's work was praised for its accuracy and depth, and the book has become a classic in the field of intelligence studies.\n\n#In Popular Culture\n\nBagley's work has been featured in various films and television shows, including \"The Spy Who Came in from the Cold\" and \"The Americans.\" His experiences and insights have also been referenced in popular culture, including in books and articles.\n\n#Personal Life\n\nBagley retired from the CIA in 1967 and went on to become a successful author and consultant. He has written several books on intelligence and espionage, including \"Spy Wars: Moles, Mysteries, and Deadly Games.\" Bagley has also been involved in various philanthropic efforts, including supporting the Central Intelligence Agency's Museum and Library.\n\nIn conclusion, Tennent H. Bagley was a highly respected and accomplished intelligence officer and author. His work on the KGB-CIA war has been widely praised, and his insights into the world of espionage have been invaluable. His legacy continues to be felt today, and his contributions to the field of intelligence studies are immeasurable.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The institution has a rich history spanning over 500 years, with various names and incarnations. This article provides an overview of the college's evolution, estate, and facilities, as well as its legacy activities and notable alumni.\n\n**History**\n\nWye College's history can be broadly divided into several distinct periods.\n\n### Chantry\n\nThe college's origins date back to the 14th century when a chantry, a collegiate church, was established at Wye. The chantry was dedicated to St. Mary and was funded by a bequest from a local benefactor. The chantry provided a place of worship, education, and charitable activities for the local community.\n\n### After abolition\n\nIn 1547, the chantry was dissolved as part of the English Reformation, and the college's assets were seized by the Crown. However, the site continued to be used as a place of education, with a school being established on the premises in the 16th century.\n\n### Lady Joanna Thornhill School\n\nIn 1798, a boarding school for girls was established at Wye, known as Lady Joanna Thornhill School. The school was named after its benefactress, Lady Joanna Thornhill, who had donated a significant sum of money to establish the institution. The school provided education to girls from wealthy families and was known for its high standards and academic excellence.\n\n### South Eastern Agricultural College\n\nIn 1894, the South Eastern Agricultural College was established at Wye, with a focus on providing education and training in agriculture and related subjects. The college was founded by the University of London and was initially known as the South Eastern University College.\n\n### Wye College\n\nIn 1950, the South Eastern Agricultural College was renamed Wye College, reflecting its growing reputation as a leading institution in agricultural education. The college expanded its curriculum to include a wide range of subjects, including economics, sociology, and biology.\n\n### Imperial College at Wye\n\nIn 2000, Wye College merged with Imperial College London to form Imperial College at Wye. The merger was part of a broader strategy to strengthen Imperial College's position as a leading research-intensive university.\n\n#### Imperial College scheme\n\nThe merger between Wye College and Imperial College London was a significant development in the history of both institutions. The scheme aimed to create a new institution that would combine the strengths of both colleges, with a focus on research, teaching, and knowledge transfer.\n\n#### Closure\n\nIn 2011, Imperial College at Wye was closed as part of a broader restructuring of Imperial College London's estate. The decision was taken after a review of the college's financial position and academic performance.\n\n**Estate and facilities**\n\nWye College's estate comprised a range of buildings and facilities, many of which date back to the 16th century.\n\n### Layout\n\nThe college's estate was laid out in a symmetrical pattern, with the main buildings arranged around a central courtyard. The layout reflected the college's origins as a chantry and later as a school.\n\n### Student accommodation\n\nWye College provided a range of student accommodation, including single and shared rooms, as well as flats and houses. The accommodation was designed to provide students with a supportive and inclusive living environment.\n\n### Old Flying Horse\n\nThe Old Flying Horse is a 16th-century timber-framed building that was once used as a tavern. The building is now used as a student residence and is one of the college's most historic and iconic buildings.\n\n### Cloister\n\nThe cloister is a 16th-century courtyard that was once used as a place of worship. The cloister is now used as a quiet space for students to study and relax.\n\n### Painted glass\n\nWye College's stained glass windows are a notable feature of the estate.

The monument, also known as the \"American Stonehenge,\" was erected in 1980 and features a set of inscriptions that outline a set of principles for a sustainable and peaceful world. The monument has sparked controversy and debate over the years, with some viewing it as a thought-provoking work of art and others seeing it as a harbinger of a new world order.\n\n**History**\n\nThe history of the Georgia Guidestones begins in 1979, when a mysterious individual, known only as \"R.C. Christian,\" approached Elbert County officials with a proposal to build a monument that would serve as a symbol of peace and sustainability. Christian, who was described as a well-educated and well-traveled individual, presented a detailed plan for the monument, including its design, construction, and inscriptions.\n\n**Construction**\n\nConstruction of the Georgia Guidestones began in 1979 and was completed in 1980. The monument was built using granite from the nearby town of Elberton, and stands 19.67 feet (6 meters) tall. The monument features four stones, each weighing over 19 tons, and a capstone that weighs over 25 tons. The stones are aligned with the movements of the sun, moon, and stars, and feature a series of inscriptions that outline a set of principles for a sustainable and peaceful world.\n\n**Reaction**\n\nThe Georgia Guidestones were officially dedicated on March 22, 1980, and were met with a mixture of excitement and skepticism. Some viewed the monument as a thought-provoking work of art, while others saw it as a harbinger of a new world order. The monument's inscriptions, which are written in eight languages, including English, Spanish, Swahili, and Hebrew, were particularly controversial, with some critics viewing them as a call to action for a one-world government.\n\n**Destruction**\n\nIn 2017, the Georgia Guidestones were vandalized, with the capstone being destroyed and the inscriptions being defaced. The vandalism was widely reported in the media, and sparked a renewed debate about the monument's meaning and significance. In the aftermath of the vandalism, the monument's owners, the Elbert County Board of Commissioners, announced plans to repair and restore the monument.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe vandalism of the Georgia Guidestones has had a significant impact on the monument's reputation and significance. While some have viewed the vandalism as a tragic event, others have seen it as an opportunity to re-examine the monument's meaning and purpose. In the aftermath of the vandalism, a new movement has emerged to preserve and protect the monument, and to ensure that its inscriptions and principles continue to inspire and guide future generations.\n\n**Description**\n\nThe Georgia Guidestones are a striking monument that features a series of inscriptions and astronomical alignments. The monument's design is inspired by ancient stone circles, and features a series of stones that are aligned with the movements of the sun, moon, and stars.\n\n**Inscriptions**\n\nThe inscriptions on the Georgia Guidestones are written in eight languages, including English, Spanish, Swahili, and Hebrew. The inscriptions outline a set of principles for a sustainable and peaceful world, and include the following:\n\n* \"Let these be guidelines for humanity\"\n* \"May kindness guide us\"\n* \"May understanding guide us\"\n* \"May we tend to the earth and sea\"\n* \"May we be aware of our true nature\"\n* \"May we be guided by reason\"\n* \"May we be aware of our place in the universe\"\n\n**Explanatory tablet**\n\nThe explanatory tablet on the Georgia Guidestones provides additional context and information about the monument's design and purpose. The tablet explains that the monument was built to serve as a symbol of peace and sustainability, and to provide a set of guidelines for humanity.\n\n**Physical data**\n\nThe Georgia Guidestones are a physical manifestation of the principles outlined in the inscriptions. The monument stands 19.67 feet (6 meters) tall, and features four stones, each weighing over 19 tons. The stones are aligned with the movements of the sun, moon, and stars, and feature a series of astronomical alignments.\n\n**Guidestone languages**\n\nThe inscriptions on the Georgia Guidestones are written in eight languages, including English, Spanish, Swahili, and Hebrew. The use of multiple languages reflects the monument's global significance and its message of peace and unity.\n\n**Astronomical features**\n\nThe Georgia Guidestones feature a series of astronomical alignments, including the movements of the sun, moon, and stars. The monument's design is inspired by ancient stone circles, and reflects a deep understanding of astronomy and mathematics.\n\n**Interpretations**\n\nThe Georgia Guidestones have sparked a wide range of interpretations and debates over the years. Some have viewed the monument as a thought-provoking work of art, while others have seen it as a harbinger of a new world order. The monument's inscriptions and principles have been interpreted in a variety of ways, including as a call to action for a one-world government, or as a simple set of guidelines for living a peaceful and sustainable life.\n\n**Conspiracy theories**\n\nThe Georgia Guidestones have been the subject of numerous conspiracy theories over the years. Some have viewed the monument as a tool for spreading a new world order, while others have seen it as a harbinger of a catastrophic event. The monument's inscriptions and principles have been interpreted as a call to action for a one-world government, or as a simple set of guidelines for living a peaceful and sustainable life.\n\n**See also**\n\n* American Stonehenge\n* Elbert County, Georgia\n* New World Order\n* One-world government\n* Sustainability\n* Peace\n\n**References**\n\n* \"Georgia Guidestones.\" Wikipedia, 2023.\n* \"The Georgia Guidestones: A Symbol of Peace and Sustainability.\" The Elberton Granite Finishing Company, n.d.\n* \"The Georgia Guidestones: A New World Order?\" The Internet Archive, n.d.\n\n**Further reading**\n\n* \"The Georgia Guidestones: A Mystery of the Modern Age.\" The Georgia Historical Quarterly, 2010.\n* \"The Georgia Guidestones: A Symbol of Peace and Unity.\" The International Journal of Peace Studies, 2015.\n\n**External links**\n\n* The Georgia Guidestones Official Website\n* The Elberton Granite Finishing Company\n* The Georgia Historical Society\n* The International Journal of Peace Studies", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

From the early days of Alexander Graham Bell's invention to the modern era of cellphones and smartphones, the telephone has played a significant role in shaping American society and culture.\n\n**AT&T and the Bell System**\n\nThe telephone industry in the United States was dominated by AT&T and its subsidiary companies, known collectively as the Bell System. The Bell System was formed in 1881 when Alexander Graham Bell and his investors founded the American Bell Telephone Company, which was later renamed AT&T in 1899.\n\n### American Bell Telephone Company (1881–1899)\n\nThe American Bell Telephone Company was founded in 1881 by Alexander Graham Bell, Thomas Watson, and Gardiner Greene Hubbard. The company's primary goal was to develop and commercialize Bell's invention of the telephone. In 1880, Bell and Watson had successfully transmitted speech over a telegraph wire, and the company quickly began to establish a network of telephone exchanges across the United States.\n\n### AT&T (1899–1982)\n\nIn 1899, AT&T acquired the assets of the American Bell Telephone Company and became the dominant force in the telephone industry. Under the leadership of Theodore Vail, AT&T expanded its network to cover the entire country and introduced new technologies, such as switchboards and operators. AT&T also established a network of research and development facilities to improve telephone technology and services.\n\n### Research priority\n\nAT&T's research priority was to improve the quality and reliability of telephone service. The company invested heavily in research and development, hiring top scientists and engineers to work on projects such as the development of the transistor and the first commercial computer.\n\n### Targeting an audience\n\nAT&T's marketing efforts targeted two primary audiences: urban public telephones and rural telephone service.\n\n#### Urban public telephones\n\nIn cities, AT&T established a network of public telephones, which were initially coin-operated. These phones were placed in phone booths, which were designed to be a convenient and efficient way for people to make phone calls.\n\n#### Rural telephone service\n\nIn rural areas, AT&T faced challenges in providing telephone service due to the lack of infrastructure and the difficulty in connecting rural communities to the main network. To overcome these challenges, AT&T introduced the concept of rural telephone cooperatives, which allowed local communities to pool their resources to establish their own telephone networks.\n\n### Breakup of AT&T in 1982\n\nIn 1982, AT&T was broken up into seven regional Bell operating companies, known as the Baby Bells, in accordance with the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice's requirements. The breakup marked a significant shift in the telecommunications industry, as it led to increased competition and innovation.\n\n**Cellphones and smartphones**\n\nThe introduction of cellphones and smartphones revolutionized the way people communicate and access information. The first cellphone was invented in 1973 by Martin Cooper, and it was later commercialized by Motorola in 1983. The first smartphone was introduced in 1992 by IBM, and it was later popularized by Apple's iPhone in 2007.\n\n**Personnel**\n\nThe telephone industry has historically employed a large number of personnel, including switchboard operators and labor force.\n\n### Switchboard and operators\n\nSwitchboard operators were responsible for connecting calls and providing customer service. They were typically women who worked in a central location, answering calls and directing them to the correct extension.\n\n### Labor force: bias for and against women\n\nThe telephone industry has a long history of bias against women. Women were often relegated to lower-paying and lower-status jobs, such as switchboard operators, while men held higher-paying and higher-status jobs, such as engineers and technicians.\n\n### Strikes\n\nThe telephone industry has experienced several strikes over the years, including a major strike by the Communications Workers of America (CWA) in 1985.\n\n### Hawthorne studies\n\nThe Hawthorne studies were a series of experiments conducted by Western Electric in the 1920s and 1930s to study the effects of working conditions on employee productivity. The studies found that changes in working conditions had a significant impact on employee morale and productivity.\n\n### Employee benefits\n\nThe telephone industry has historically offered a range of employee benefits, including health insurance, pension plans, and paid time off.\n\n**Users**\n\nThe telephone industry has a wide range of users, including businesses, housewives, and individuals.\n\n### Business\n\nBusinesses use the telephone to communicate with customers, suppliers, and employees. The telephone is an essential tool for businesses, allowing them to communicate quickly and efficiently.\n\n### Housewives\n\nHousewives use the telephone to communicate with family members, friends, and neighbors. The telephone has become an essential tool for housewives, allowing them to stay connected with others and access information.\n\n### Gender and culture roles\n\nThe telephone has played a significant role in shaping gender and culture roles. The telephone has allowed women to take on new roles and responsibilities, such as working outside the home and participating in the workforce.\n\n### Telemarketing\n\nTelemarketing is a type of direct marketing that uses the telephone to sell products or services. Telemarketing has become a popular method for businesses to reach customers and promote their products.\n\n### 9-1-1\n\nThe 9-1-1 system is a network of emergency services that use the telephone to connect callers with emergency responders. The 9-1-1 system is an essential tool for emergency services, allowing them to respond quickly and efficiently to emergencies.\n\n### Harassing calls\n\nHarassing calls are a type of telephone call that is intended to intimidate or harass the recipient. Harassing calls are a serious issue, and can be reported to authorities.\n\n### Literary fears\n\nThe telephone has been the subject of many literary works, including horror stories and science fiction novels. The telephone has been depicted as a source of fear and anxiety, often symbolizing the unknown and the uncontrollable.\n\n**See also**\n\n* History of the telephone\n* Telephone industry\n* Telecommunications\n* Communication studies\n* Social and cultural studies\n* Technology studies\n* Business studies\n* Sociology\n\n**References**\n\nThis article has no references.\n\n**Further reading**\n\n* History of the Telephone (Wikipedia article)\n* Telephone Industry (Wikipedia article)\n* Telecommunications (Wikipedia article)\n* Communication Studies (Wikipedia article)\n* Social and Cultural Studies (Wikipedia article)\n* Technology Studies (Wikipedia article)\n* Business Studies (Wikipedia article)\n* Sociology (Wikipedia article)\n\n**External links**\n\n* AT&T website\n* Bell System website\n* Telephone industry website\n* Telecommunications website\n* Communication studies website\n* Social and cultural studies website\n* Technology studies website\n* Business studies website\n* Sociology website", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

Born on December 8, 1970, in Dublin, Ireland, O'Connor rose to international fame in the late 1980s with her debut album, \"The Lion and the Cobra.\" Her career spans over three decades, marked by creative experimentation, personal struggles, and a commitment to social justice.\n\n**Early life and education**\n\nO'Connor was born to Sean and Marie O'Connor, a working-class family in Dublin's Liberties neighborhood. Her father, a truck driver, was an abusive and violent man who later abandoned the family. O'Connor's mother, a devout Catholic, struggled to provide for her children, and the family relied on government assistance. O'Connor's early life was marked by poverty, neglect, and a strained relationship with her father.\n\nO'Connor attended the Loreto Convent in Dublin, where she became immersed in music and developed a passion for singing. She later attended Cabra Community School in Dublin, where she was exposed to various musical styles and influences. Her musical talents were recognized early, and she began performing at local events and competitions.\n\n**Music career**\n\n### 1980s\n\nO'Connor's music career began in the late 1980s, when she formed a band called Ton Ton Macoute. The band gained local attention, but O'Connor's unique voice and style eventually led her to pursue a solo career.\n\n### 1987–1989: The Lion and the Cobra\n\nO'Connor's debut album, \"The Lion and the Cobra,\" was released in 1987 to mixed reviews. Despite initial skepticism, the album's singles, such as \"Mandinka\" and \"Troy,\" gained traction, and O'Connor's distinctive voice and style began to attract attention.\n\n### 1990–1993: I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got\n\nO'Connor's second album, \"I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got,\" released in 1990, marked a significant turning point in her career. The album's lead single, \"Nothing Compares 2 U,\" became a worldwide hit, reaching number one in numerous countries and selling over 30 million copies. O'Connor's powerful, emotive voice and the song's haunting melody made it an instant classic.\n\n#### Saturday Night Live protest\n\nIn 1992, O'Connor appeared on Saturday Night Live, where she performed \"Nothing Compares 2 U\" as a tribute to the victims of the Bosnian War. However, during the performance, O'Connor removed a photograph of Pope John Paul II from her jacket and tore it apart, sparking controversy and outrage. The incident was widely reported and cemented O'Connor's reputation as a provocative and uncompromising artist.\n\n### 1993–2000\n\nO'Connor's subsequent albums, \"Am I Not Your Girl?\" (1992) and \"Universal Mother\" (1995), explored themes of motherhood, identity, and spirituality. The albums received critical acclaim, but O'Connor's commercial success began to decline.\n\n### 2000s\n\nIn the early 2000s, O'Connor continued to experiment with her sound, releasing the albums \"Faith and Courage\" (2000) and \"She Who Dwells in the Secret of My Heart\" (2002). However, her mental health issues and personal struggles began to impact her career.\n\n### 2010s\n\nO'Connor's 2010s output was marked by creative experimentation and a return to her roots. She released the albums \"The Invisible Speck\" (2012) and \"I'm Not Bossy, I'm the Boss\" (2014), which featured collaborations with artists such as Mavis Staples and Steve Winwood.\n\n### 2020–2023: Memoir and death of son\n\nIn 2020, O'Connor published her memoir, \"Rememberings,\" which detailed her life story, including her experiences with mental health, relationships, and her struggles with fame. Tragically, in 2022, O'Connor's 17-year-old son, Shane, died by suicide. O'Connor has spoken publicly about her grief and has continued to advocate for mental health awareness and support.\n\n**Personal life**\n\n### Marriages and children\n\nO'Connor has been married four times: to John Waters (1987), to Nick Fenton (1992), to Barry Herridge (2001), and to Donal Lunny (2010). She has four children: Jake, Roisin, Shane, and Yeshua.\n\n### Other relationships\n\nO'Connor has been involved in several high-profile relationships, including with musician Steve Alfred and activist Michael Powell.\n\n### Homes\n\nO'Connor has lived in various locations, including Dublin, London, and Los Angeles.\n\n### Sexuality\n\nO'Connor identifies as bisexual and has spoken about her experiences with same-sex relationships.\n\n### Politics\n\nO'Connor has been an outspoken advocate for social justice, supporting causes such as women's rights, LGBTQ+ rights, and anti-apartheid activism.\n\n### Religion\n\nO'Connor was raised Catholic but has since identified as agnostic and has spoken about her struggles with faith.\n\n### Health\n\nO'Connor has struggled with mental health issues, including depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder. She has spoken publicly about her experiences and has advocated for mental health awareness and support.\n\n### Death\n\nO'Connor is still alive, but her personal struggles and health issues have been well-documented.\n\n**Tributes**\n\nO'Connor has been the subject of numerous tributes and collaborations, including the 1992 \"Nothing Compares 2 U\" tribute album, which featured artists such as Elton John and Prince. In 2012, O'Connor was inducted into the Irish Music Hall of Fame.\n\n**In popular culture**\n\nO'Connor's music and image have influenced numerous artists, including Madonna, Prince, and Patti Smith. Her music has been featured in various films and television shows, including \"The Bodyguard\" and \"The X-Files.\"\n\n**Discography**\n\n* \"The Lion and the Cobra\" (1987)\n* \"I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got\" (1990)\n* \"Am I Not Your Girl?\" (1992)\n* \"Universal Mother\" (1995)\n* \"Faith and Courage\" (2000)\n* \"She Who Dwells in the Secret of My Heart\" (2002)\n* \"The Invisible Speck\" (2012)\n* \"I'm Not Bossy, I'm the Boss\" (2014)\n\n**Filmography**\n\n* \"The Bodyguard\" (1992)\n* \"The X-Files\" (1993)\n* \"The Secret Policeman's Biggest Ball\" (2012)\n\n**Awards**\n\n* Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance (1991)\n* MTV Video Music Award for Best Female Video (1991)\n* Billboard Music Award for Top Female Artist (1992)\n\n**See also**\n\n* Irish music\n* Women in music\n* LGBTQ+ rights\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is based on publicly available information and may not be comprehensive or up-to-date.\n\n**References**\n\n* None\n\n**Further reading**\n\n* \"Rememberings\" by Sinéad O'Connor (2020)\n* \"The Sinéad O'Connor Story\" by Peter Buckley (2002)\n\n**External links**\n\n* Sinéad O'Connor's official website\n* Sinéad O'Connor's official social media accounts", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

It belongs to the genus Torreya, which is a group of conifers characterized by their distinctive seeds and large, pinnately compound leaves. This article provides an overview of the species' discovery, taxonomy, distribution, ecology, conservation status, and management efforts.\n\n**Species Discovery**\n\nTorreya taxifolia was first described by American botanist Asa Gray in 1853, based on a specimen collected in the Apalachicola River valley in Florida. At the time, the species was considered to be a rare and local occurrence. However, it was not until the mid-20th century that the full extent of its range was explored, revealing that the species was more widespread than initially thought.\n\n**Taxonomy and Naming**\n\nTorreya taxifolia is the type species of the genus Torreya, which is named after the Italian botanist Fortunato Moricand (1808-1879). The species name \"taxifolia\" is derived from the Latin words \"taxus,\" meaning yew, and \"folium,\" meaning leaf, in reference to the species' distinctive leaf morphology.\n\n**Type Species of Genus Torreya**\n\nAs the type species of the genus Torreya, T. taxifolia has been used as a reference point for the classification and identification of other species within the genus. Its characteristics, such as the large, persistent cones and the distinctive seed shape, are used to distinguish it from other conifers.\n\n**Common Names**\n\nTorreya taxifolia is commonly known as the Florida nutmeg or Florida torreya, due to its resemblance to the nutmeg tree (Myristica fragrans). It is also occasionally referred to as the Apalachicola nutmeg or the Florida pitch pine.\n\n**Description**\n\n**Technical Description**\n\nTorreya taxifolia is a coniferous tree that typically grows to a height of 15-20 meters (50-65 feet). Its trunk is straight and cylindrical, with a diameter of up to 1 meter (3.3 feet). The bark is reddish-brown and scaly, with deep furrows and ridges. The leaves are large and pinnately compound, consisting of 10-20 needle-like branches that are 2-4 centimeters (0.8-1.6 inches) long.\n\n**Subcanopy Growth Adaptations**\n\nTorreya taxifolia has adapted to grow in the subcanopy layer of forests, where it receives filtered sunlight and moist conditions. Its leaves are adapted to capture the limited light available in this environment, with a high density of chlorophyll and a reflective upper surface to reduce light absorption.\n\n**Distribution**\n\n**Wild Population**\n\nTorreya taxifolia is found in the wild in the southeastern United States, specifically in the states of Florida, Georgia, and Alabama. Its range is limited to the Apalachicola River valley and surrounding areas, where it grows in association with other conifers and hardwoods.\n\n**Prehistoric Distribution**\n\nFossil evidence suggests that T. taxifolia was more widespread in the past, with remains found in the southeastern United States dating back to the Paleocene epoch (66-56 million years ago). Its range may have been affected by changes in climate and geology over time.\n\n**Ecology**\n\n**Habitat**\n\nTorreya taxifolia grows in a variety of habitats, including coniferous and deciduous forests, swamps, and savannas. It requires a moist environment with well-drained soil and filtered sunlight.\n\n**Seed Dispersal**\n\nThe seeds of T. taxifolia are dispersed by birds and small mammals, which feed on the cones and then deposit the seeds in new locations. The seeds are also dispersed by water, which aids in germination and establishment of new individuals.\n\n**Extinction Threats**\n\n**Vulnerabilities of Restricted Range Size**\n\nTorreya taxifolia is vulnerable to extinction due to its limited range size and restricted distribution. The species is found in only a few locations, making it susceptible to local extinctions and habitat loss.\n\n**The Die-Off Begins**\n\nIn the early 20th century, a die-off of T. taxifolia began, with reports of trees dying in large numbers. The causes of the die-off were not immediately clear, but it was suspected to be related to disease, insects, and environmental factors.\n\n**The Role of Pathogens in the Die-Off**\n\nResearch has suggested that pathogens may have played a role in the die-off, with fungal and bacterial diseases identified as potential causes. However, the exact mechanisms of the die-off remain unclear.\n\n**The Role of Habitat Deterioration in the Die-Off**\n\nHabitat deterioration may also have contributed to the die-off, with changes in land use and environmental conditions affecting the species' ability to survive.\n\n**Focus on a Stem Canker Fungus**\n\nOne potential cause of the die-off is a stem canker fungus (Discosphaerina torreyaecola), which has been identified as a pathogen of T. taxifolia. However, the role of this fungus in the die-off is still being researched and debated.\n\n**Ultimate Cause of Die-Off Still Unsolved**\n\nDespite extensive research, the ultimate cause of the die-off of T. taxifolia remains unclear. It is likely that a combination of factors contributed to the decline of the species.\n\n**Conservation Actions**\n\n**Protect Areas in Species Range**\n\nConservation efforts are focused on protecting areas within the species' range and improving habitat conditions. This includes the establishment of protected areas, such as national parks and wildlife refuges.\n\n**List the Species as Endangered**\n\nTorreya taxifolia has been listed as an endangered species by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, recognizing its critical conservation status.\n\n**In Situ Habitat Improvement**\n\nIn situ habitat improvement involves modifying the environment to improve conditions for T. taxifolia. This includes thinning of competitor vegetation, pruning of trees, and introduction of native species.\n\n**Ex Situ Genetic Safeguarding**\n\nEx situ genetic safeguarding involves the collection and storage of seeds and genetic material from T. taxifolia. This allows for the preservation of genetic diversity and the potential for reintroduction of the species into the wild.\n\n**Document Early Horticultural Plantings**\n\nHistorical records of early horticultural plantings of T. taxifolia provide valuable information on the species' cultivation and growth. These records can inform modern conservation efforts and improve our understanding of the species' ecology.\n\n**Conservation Controversies**\n\n**Assisted Migration (the Policy Debate)**\n\nAssisted migration, or the deliberate movement of species from one location to another, is a contentious issue in conservation. Some argue that assisted migration can help to reestablish populations of T. taxifolia, while others raise concerns about genetic integrity and potential impacts on native ecosystems.\n\n**Management of Seeds Produced Ex Situ**\n\nManagement of seeds produced ex situ is a critical aspect of conservation efforts. This includes the use of seeds from official plantings, as well as those accessed by citizens.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

It is native to the Mediterranean region and Western Asia.\n\n**Distribution**\n\nAnagyris foetida is widely distributed across the Mediterranean region, including countries such as Spain, France, Italy, Greece, Turkey, and Israel. It also occurs in Western Asia, including parts of Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan.\n\n**Habitat**\n\nAnagyris foetida typically grows in well-drained soils in dry to semi-dry areas, often in association with Mediterranean scrub and oak woodlands. It can thrive in a variety of habitats, including rocky outcrops, scrublands, and open woodlands.\n\n**Adaptations to growth in Winter and early Spring**\n\nAnagyris foetida has several adaptations that enable it to survive and grow in the harsh winter and early spring conditions of the Mediterranean region.\n\n### **Summer leaf-fall**\n\nAnagyris foetida is a deciduous plant that sheds its leaves during the summer months. This adaptation helps the plant conserve water and protect its leaves from excessive heat and drought.\n\n### **Pollination by birds**\n\nAnagyris foetida is pollinated by birds, which visit the plant's flowers in search of nectar. The plant's flowers are rich in nectar and offer a valuable source of energy for birds during the summer months.\n\n**Seed dispersal**\n\nAnagyris foetida has several mechanisms for seed dispersal, which enable it to spread to new areas and establish itself in new habitats.\n\n## **Soil seed banks**\n\nAnagyris foetida seeds can remain dormant in the soil for several years, allowing the plant to establish a soil seed bank. This enables the plant to survive periods of unfavorable conditions and recover quickly when conditions improve.\n\n## **Olive mimicry**\n\nAnagyris foetida seeds resemble those of the olive tree, which can lead to accidental ingestion by humans and animals. This mimicry may provide a means of seed dispersal, as the seeds are inadvertently eaten and deposited in new areas.\n\n## **Role of sheep**\n\nSheep may inadvertently disperse Anagyris foetida seeds by eating the plant's flowers and leaves and then depositing the seeds in new areas through their droppings.\n\n## **Other possible mammalian and avian vectors**\n\nOther animals, such as rodents and birds, may also play a role in dispersing Anagyris foetida seeds.\n\n## **Unknown seed dispersal vector**\n\nThere may be other, as yet unknown, vectors that contribute to seed dispersal of Anagyris foetida.\n\n## **Tough, waterproof seed coats**\n\nAnagyris foetida seeds have a tough, waterproof seed coat that allows them to survive for extended periods in the soil and withstand harsh weather conditions.\n\n**Value as a nitrogen-fixing pioneer and companion plant**\n\nAnagyris foetida is a nitrogen-fixing plant that can improve soil fertility and provide a valuable resource for other plants growing in the same area. It can also serve as a pioneer plant, helping to establish new habitats and ecosystems.\n\n**Medicinal use**\n\nAnagyris foetida has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes, including the treatment of respiratory problems and as a diuretic.\n\n**Toxicity**\n\nAnagyris foetida contains several toxic compounds, including the alkaloid anagyrine, which can cause birth defects if ingested during pregnancy.\n\n## **Alkaloid anagyrine a cause of birth defects**\n\nAnagyrine is a known teratogen that can cause birth defects if ingested during pregnancy. This highlights the importance of caution when handling Anagyris foetida or consuming products that may contain its seeds or extracts.\n\n## **Danger to children**\n\nAnagyris foetida seeds and extracts can be hazardous to children, who may accidentally ingest them or be exposed to the plant's toxic compounds.\n\n## **Hazardous tainting of milk products**\n\nAnagyris foetida seeds can contaminate milk products if they are ingested by grazing animals, highlighting the importance of proper handling and storage of milk products.\n\n## **Case of accidental poisoning in Algeria**\n\nThere have been reported cases of accidental poisoning in Algeria, where individuals ingested Anagyris foetida seeds or extracts, leading to serious health consequences.\n\n**Cultural references: Anagyris and Anagyrous**\n\nThe name \"Anagyris\" has been referenced in various cultural contexts, including the works of the ancient Greek playwright Aristophanes.\n\n## **Lysistrata**\n\nIn Aristophanes' play \"Lysistrata\", the character Anagyrous is mentioned as a representative of the city of Anagyris.\n\n## **Persistence of name**\n\nThe name \"Anagyris\" has persisted throughout history, highlighting the importance of the plant in ancient cultures and its continued relevance today.\n\n**Gallery**\n\n### **Anagyris foetida**\n\nAn image of Anagyris foetida, showing its distinctive flowers and leaves.\n\n### **Avian pollinators**\n\nAn image of birds pollinating Anagyris foetida flowers.\n\n### **Avian nectar thief**\n\nAn image of a bird stealing nectar from Anagyris foetida flowers.\n\n### **Insect pollinators**\n\nAn image of insects pollinating Anagyris foetida flowers.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Mediterranean flora\n* Fabaceae\n* Nitrogen-fixing plants\n* Pioneer plants\n* Medicinal plants\n* Toxic plants", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

However, in 2015, Söhnlein left OceanGate, citing creative differences and a desire to pursue other projects. Despite this setback, the Cyclops 1 was completed and underwent rigorous testing, demonstrating its capabilities in various deep-sea environments.\n\n### 2016–2023: Expansion of fleet and dives to the Titanic\n\nFollowing the success of Cyclops 1, OceanGate expanded its fleet with the acquisition of S-501, a submersible designed for deeper dives. The company also developed a new submersible, Titan, a 24-foot (7.3 meters) long, 5-foot (1.5 meters) diameter vessel capable of reaching depths of up to 12,500 feet (3,800 meters). In 2019, OceanGate made history by becoming the first private company to take tourists to the wreck of the RMS Titanic. The company's submersible, Titan, took five tourists on a 4.5-hour dive to the wreck site, marking a significant milestone in the company's expansion.\n\n### 2023: Implosion of Titan and death of Rush\n\nOn June 18, 2023, OceanGate's submersible, Titan, imploded during a dive to the wreck of the USS Johnson Sea Link, a US Navy submersible that had sunk in 1973. The incident resulted in the loss of five lives, including Stockton Rush, the founder and CEO of OceanGate. The incident was met with widespread shock and sadness, and it remains a major setback for the company.\n\n**Submersibles**\n\nOceanGate operates a fleet of advanced submersibles designed for deep-sea exploration and research. The company's submersibles are known for their innovative designs, cutting-edge technology, and ability to operate in extreme environments.\n\n### Antipodes\n\nAntipodes was a US-based company specializing in manned submersibles. OceanGate acquired Antipodes in 2011, incorporating its designs and expertise into its own operations.\n\n### Cyclops 1\n\nCyclops 1 is a 21-foot (6.4 meters) long, 5-foot (1.5 meters) diameter submersible designed for deep-sea exploration. The vessel was constructed by OceanGate in 2013 and underwent rigorous testing, demonstrating its capabilities in various deep-sea environments.\n\n### Titan\n\nTitan is a 24-foot (7.3 meters) long, 5-foot (1.5 meters) diameter submersible capable of reaching depths of up to 12,500 feet (3,800 meters).
