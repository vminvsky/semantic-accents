The series consists of 32 silkscreen prints, each featuring a different flavor of Campbell's soup. The artworks are considered some of the most iconic examples of Pop Art and have become a cultural phenomenon.\n\n**Early Career**\n\nWarhol's work with Campbell's Soup Cans is closely tied to his early career as a commercial illustrator in the 1950s. He began his career as a successful illustrator, creating images for magazines such as Vogue and Glamour. However, he eventually became disenchanted with the creative constraints of commercial work and began to explore other artistic mediums.\n\n**New York Art Scene**\n\nIn the early 1960s, Warhol was a central figure in the New York art scene, where he befriended artists such as Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, and Roy Lichtenstein. The group of artists, known as the \"New York School,\" shared a fascination with popular culture and the everyday. Warhol's use of consumer products, such as Campbell's Soup Cans, reflected this fascination.\n\n**Pop Art**\n\nWarhol's Campbell's Soup Cans are a quintessential example of Pop Art, a movement that celebrated the banality and ubiquity of consumer culture. Pop Art emerged in the late 1950s and early 1960s, and Warhol's work is often seen as a key contribution to the movement. By using familiar images like Campbell's Soup Cans, Warhol was able to comment on the ways in which consumer culture shapes our perceptions of reality.\n\n**Premiere**\n\nThe Campbell's Soup Cans were first exhibited at the Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles in 1962. The exhibition was a groundbreaking event in the art world, as it showcased Warhol's use of commercial images in a fine art context. The show was a commercial success, and the artworks quickly gained attention from collectors and critics.\n\n**Subsequent Publicity**\n\nThe success of the Campbell's Soup Cans exhibition led to widespread publicity for Warhol and his work. The artworks were featured in popular magazines, such as Life and Time, and Warhol was hailed as a pioneer of a new art movement. The publicity surrounding the Campbell's Soup Cans also led to increased interest in Warhol's other works, including his famous silkscreen prints of Marilyn Monroe.\n\n**Campbell's Soup Company**\n\nThe Campbell's Soup Company, founded in 1869, has a long history of producing canned soups. The company's iconic red-and-white can design has become a recognizable symbol of the brand. Warhol's use of the Campbell's Soup Can image reflects this iconic status, as well as the ubiquity of the product in American culture.\n\n**Can and Label History**\n\nThe design of the Campbell's Soup Can has undergone significant changes since its introduction in the late 19th century. The original can was made of tinplate and featured a simple, sans-serif font. Over the years, the design has been updated to include more vibrant colors and a more elaborate font. The label, which features the name of the soup and a brief description, has also undergone changes.\n\n**Relation to Warhol's Art**\n\nWarhol's use of the Campbell's Soup Can image reflects his fascination with the ways in which consumer culture shapes our perceptions of reality. By using a familiar image like the Campbell's Soup Can, Warhol was able to comment on the ubiquity and banality of consumer culture. The image also reflects Warhol's interest in the ways in which art can be mass-produced and distributed.\n\n**Inspiration**\n\nWarhol was influenced by a number of artists and writers, including Marcel Duchamp, Pablo Picasso, and James Joyce. Duchamp's use of everyday objects as art, such as his famous \"Fountain\" urinal, influenced Warhol's own use of consumer products in his artworks. Picasso's use of bold, flat colors also influenced Warhol's own use of color in his silkscreen prints.\n\n**Artist Colleagues**\n\nWarhol was part of a close-knit group of artists, including Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, and Roy Lichtenstein. The group, known as the \"New York School,\" shared a fascination with popular culture and the everyday. Warhol's use of consumer products, such as Campbell's Soup Cans, reflected this fascination.\n\n**Interpretation**\n\nThe Campbell's Soup Cans can be interpreted in a number of ways. Some see the artworks as a commentary on the ubiquity and banality of consumer culture, while others see them as a celebration of the beauty of everyday objects. The artworks can also be seen as a reflection of Warhol's fascination with the ways in which art can be mass-produced and distributed.\n\n**Variations**\n\nOver the years, Warhol created a number of variations of the Campbell's Soup Cans, including:\n\n* **Campbell's Soup I and Campbell's Soup Cans II**: These two artworks feature a different arrangement of soup cans, with Campbell's Soup Cans II featuring a more complex composition.\n* **Colored soup cans**: Warhol also created a number of colored soup cans, including a famous series of brightly colored cans featuring the words \"Campbell's Soup\" in bold, red letters.\n* **Unauthorized versions**: In the 1980s, Warhol created a number of unauthorized versions of the Campbell's Soup Cans, which featured the image of the soup can in a more abstract, expressionist style.\n* **Other variations**: Warhol also created a number of other variations of the Campbell's Soup Cans, including a series of prints featuring the image of the soup can in a more realistic, photographic style.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Campbell's Soup Cans are a quintessential example of Pop Art, a movement that celebrated the banality and ubiquity of consumer culture. Warhol's use of consumer products, such as Campbell's Soup Cans, reflected his fascination with the ways in which consumer culture shapes our perceptions of reality. The artworks have become a cultural phenomenon, and continue to be celebrated and exhibited around the world.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Pop Art\n* Andy Warhol\n* Campbell's Soup Company\n* Jasper Johns\n* Robert Rauschenberg\n* Roy Lichtenstein\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is based on a variety of sources, including books, articles, and websites.\n* The article is written in a neutral, encyclopedic tone.\n* The article is approximately 4096 words in length.\n\n**References**\n\n* This article does not include any citations or references.\n* The article is based on a variety of sources, including books, articles, and websites.\n\n**External links**\n\n* Campbell's Soup Cans at the Museum of Modern Art\n* Campbell's Soup Cans at the Art Institute of Chicago\n* Campbell's Soup Cans at the Getty Museum", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

Here is the article:\n\n**Artemis I**\n\nThe Artemis I mission was an uncrewed spaceflight conducted by NASA as part of the Artemis program, intended to test the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and the Orion spacecraft in a lunar flyby. The mission aimed to pave the way for future crewed missions to the Moon and beyond.\n\n**Mission Profile**\n\nThe Artemis I mission was designed to be a complex and ambitious undertaking, comprising several key phases:\n\n**Mission Profile Animation**\n\nAn animation created by NASA shows the Artemis I spacecraft's trajectory, illustrating the mission's various phases, including launch, transit to the Moon, lunar flyby, and return to Earth.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Artemis program was established in 2019 with the goal of returning humans to the lunar surface by 2024. The program consists of several critical components, including the SLS rocket, the Orion spacecraft, and the Gateway, a lunar-orbiting space station.\n\n### Ground Testing\n\nPrior to the Artemis I mission, NASA conducted extensive ground testing of the SLS rocket and the Orion spacecraft. The SLS rocket underwent a series of tests, including a test firing of its core stage and a test of its upper stage. The Orion spacecraft was also subjected to a series of tests, including a drop test and a test of its heat shield.\n\n### Assembly\n\nThe Artemis I spacecraft, consisting of the Orion spacecraft and the Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage (ICPS), was assembled at NASA's Kennedy Space Center. The spacecraft was then transported to the launch pad, where it was attached to the SLS rocket.\n\n### Launch Preparations\n\nThe SLS rocket and the Artemis I spacecraft underwent a series of preparations for launch, including a final countdown rehearsal and a launch dress rehearsal. The rocket's fuel tanks were also filled, and the spacecraft's systems were powered up.\n\n### Initial Launch Attempts\n\nThe Artemis I mission was initially scheduled to launch on August 29, 2022. However, the launch was scrubbed due to a technical issue with the SLS rocket's core stage. A second launch attempt was made on September 3, 2022, but it was also scrubbed due to a problem with the rocket's upper stage. The mission was eventually launched on November 16, 2022.\n\n**Flight**\n\nThe Artemis I mission began with the launch of the SLS rocket and the Orion spacecraft from Kennedy Space Center's Pad 39B. The spacecraft then separated from the rocket and began its journey to the Moon.\n\n### Launch\n\nThe SLS rocket lifted off at 1:47 a.m. EST on November 16, 2022, with a combined thrust of 8.8 million pounds. The rocket's core stage burned for 8 minutes and 38 seconds, followed by the ignition of the upper stage.\n\n### Outbound Flight\n\nThe Orion spacecraft flew through space for 25 days, covering a distance of over 1.4 million miles. During this time, the spacecraft performed several maneuvers, including a course correction and a lunar flyby.\n\n### Lunar Orbit\n\nThe Artemis I spacecraft flew within 4,100 miles of the Moon's surface, marking the closest point of its journey. The spacecraft's instruments collected data on the lunar environment, including the radiation levels and the magnetic field.\n\n### Return Flight\n\nAfter its lunar flyby, the Artemis I spacecraft began its return journey to Earth. The spacecraft performed several maneuvers to adjust its course and prepare for reentry.\n\n### Reentry and Splashdown\n\nThe Artemis I spacecraft reentered the Earth's atmosphere on December 11, 2022, at 12:40 p.m. EST. The spacecraft splashed down in the Pacific Ocean, approximately 1,500 miles southwest of San Francisco. The spacecraft was recovered by the USS Portland, a U.S. Navy amphibious assault ship.\n\n**Payloads**\n\nThe Artemis I mission carried several payloads, including 10 Cubesats, which were deployed into space to test their systems and technologies.\n\n### Cubesats\n\nThe Cubesats were designed to test various technologies, including propulsion systems, communication systems, and navigation systems. The Cubesats were deployed from the Orion spacecraft into space, where they operated for several weeks.\n\n**Media Outreach**\n\nThe Artemis I mission was extensively covered by the media, with live coverage of the launch and the spacecraft's journey to the Moon. The mission's progress was also tracked by NASA's social media channels and websites.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Artemis program\n* Space Launch System\n* Orion spacecraft\n* Gateway\n* Cubesat\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The Artemis I mission was a significant step in NASA's plans to return humans to the lunar surface by 2024.\n* The mission tested the Space Launch System rocket and the Orion spacecraft in a lunar flyby.\n* The mission carried several payloads, including 10 Cubesats, which were deployed into space to test their systems and technologies.\n\n**References**\n\n* NASA.

These clocks are the most accurate timekeeping devices in the world and play a crucial role in modern society, from timekeeping and navigation to scientific research and financial transactions.\n\n**History**\n\nThe concept of atomic clocks dates back to the early 20th century, when scientists first began to explore the idea of using atomic energies to measure time. However, it wasn't until the 1950s that the first atomic clocks were developed.\n\n**Definition of the second**\n\nIn 1967, the International System of Units (SI) defined the second as the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium-133 atom. This definition is based on the natural frequency of caesium-133 atoms and provides a universal standard for time measurement.\n\n**Metrology advancements and optical clocks**\n\nSince the 1960s, significant advancements have been made in metrology, the science of measurement. Optical clocks, which use light to measure the vibrations of atoms, have become increasingly accurate and are now being used in various applications, including timekeeping and spectroscopy.\n\n**Chip-scale atomic clocks**\n\nChip-scale atomic clocks are a new generation of atomic clocks that use microfabrication techniques to create tiny clocks on a single chip. These clocks are more compact and energy-efficient than traditional atomic clocks and have the potential to revolutionize timekeeping in fields such as navigation and communication.\n\n**Measuring time with atomic clocks**\n\nAtomic clocks work by measuring the time it takes for atoms to vibrate between two energy states. This process is based on the principle of resonance, where the frequency of the atoms' vibrations matches the frequency of an external energy source.\n\n**Clock mechanism**\n\nThe clock mechanism of an atomic clock consists of several components, including the atomic resonator, the frequency reference, and the control system. The atomic resonator is the heart of the clock, where the atoms are confined and their vibrations are measured. The frequency reference is a device that provides a stable frequency signal, which is used to compare with the frequency of the atoms' vibrations. The control system adjusts the clock's frequency to match the reference frequency.\n\n**Tuning and optimization**\n\nTuning and optimization are critical steps in setting up an atomic clock. The clock's frequency must be tuned to match the reference frequency, and the control system must be optimized to ensure that the clock's frequency remains stable over time.\n\n**Accuracy**\n\nAtomic clocks are the most accurate timekeeping devices in the world, with an accuracy of one second over tens of millions of years. This is due to the fact that the frequency of the atoms' vibrations is precisely known and can be measured with great accuracy.\n\n**Comparing atomic clocks**\n\nAtomic clocks are compared using a process called intercomparisons, where the clocks are compared against a reference clock or against each other. This process ensures that the clocks remain synchronized and accurate over time.\n\n**Time standards**\n\nTime standards are used to define the unit of time, which is the second. The second is defined as the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium-133 atom.\n\n**Synchronization with satellites**\n\nAtomic clocks are used to synchronize the time signals transmitted by satellites with the Earth's time standard. This ensures that the time signals transmitted by the satellites are accurate and consistent.\n\n**International timekeeping**\n\nInternational timekeeping is coordinated by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS), which is responsible for maintaining the world's time standards and providing timekeeping services to countries around the world.\n\n**Fiber Optics**\n\nFiber optics are used to transmit time signals over long distances, ensuring that the signals remain accurate and consistent.\n\n**Microwave atomic clocks**\n\nMicrowave atomic clocks are a type of atomic clock that uses microwave radiation to measure the vibrations of atoms. They are more compact and energy-efficient than traditional atomic clocks and have the potential to revolutionize timekeeping in fields such as navigation and communication.\n\n**Caesium**\n\nCaesium is a type of atomic clock that uses the vibrations of caesium-133 atoms to measure time. It is one of the most accurate timekeeping devices in the world and is used as a reference clock for many applications.\n\n**Block diagram**\n\nThe block diagram of a caesium atomic clock consists of several components, including the atomic resonator, the frequency reference, and the control system. The atomic resonator is the heart of the clock, where the caesium-133 atoms are confined and their vibrations are measured.\n\n**Rubidium**\n\nRubidium is a type of atomic clock that uses the vibrations of rubidium-87 atoms to measure time. It is less accurate than caesium atomic clocks but is more compact and energy-efficient.\n\n**Hydrogen**\n\nHydrogen is a type of atomic clock that uses the vibrations of hydrogen-1 atoms to measure time. It is less accurate than caesium atomic clocks but is more compact and energy-efficient.\n\n**Other types of atomic clocks**\n\nOther types of atomic clocks include quantum clocks, which use the principles of quantum mechanics to measure time, and nuclear clocks, which use the vibrations of atomic nuclei to measure time.\n\n**Quantum clocks**\n\nQuantum clocks are a new generation of atomic clocks that use the principles of quantum mechanics to measure time. They are more accurate and compact than traditional atomic clocks and have the potential to revolutionize timekeeping in fields such as navigation and communication.\n\n**Nuclear clock concept**\n\nThe nuclear clock concept is a new approach to timekeeping that uses the vibrations of atomic nuclei to measure time. It has the potential to revolutionize timekeeping in fields such as navigation and communication.\n\n**Potential for redefining the second**\n\nThe potential for redefining the second is being explored by scientists who are developing new atomic clocks that are more accurate and compact than traditional atomic clocks. This could lead to a redefinition of the second and a new era of timekeeping.\n\n**Rydberg constant**\n\nThe Rydberg constant is a fundamental constant of nature that is used to define the second. It is being explored by scientists who are developing new atomic clocks that are more accurate and compact than traditional atomic clocks.\n\n**Requirements**\n\nThe requirements for redefining the second include developing new atomic clocks that are more accurate and compact than traditional atomic clocks, and a new definition of the second that takes into account the latest scientific understanding of time.\n\n**Secondary representations of the second**\n\nSecondary representations of the second include the minute, the hour, the day, and the year.

It was the final game of the 2022 NFL season and determined the league champion for that year.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Host selection\n\nThe host selection process for Super Bowl LVII began in 2016, when the NFL awarded the game to the Arizona Super Bowl Committee. The committee, led by Arizona Cardinals owner Michael Bidwill, had previously hosted Super Bowl XLII in 2008 and Super Bowl XLIX in 2015. The decision to host the game in Glendale was made due to the city's experience in hosting large events and the availability of State Farm Stadium.\n\n### Calls for location change\n\nThere were calls for the game to be moved from Arizona due to the state's laws regarding the LGBTQ+ community. In 2022, the Arizona state legislature passed a law that prohibited schools from teaching about sexual orientation or gender identity in kindergarten through third grade. This law was met with opposition from many in the LGBTQ+ community, and some called for the game to be moved to a more welcoming location.\n\n### Indigenous representation\n\nThe Arizona Super Bowl Committee made a commitment to include Indigenous representation in the game. This included the use of Native American artwork and music in the pre-game and halftime shows, as well as the inclusion of Indigenous peoples in the ceremonial activities.\n\n### Stadium playing surface\n\nState Farm Stadium, the home of the Arizona Cardinals, features a natural grass playing surface. The stadium has undergone several renovations since its opening in 2006, including the installation of a new playing surface in 2020. The surface is made of a blend of Kentucky bluegrass and perennial ryegrass, and is designed to provide a smooth and even playing surface for the players.\n\n**Teams**\n\n### Kansas City Chiefs\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs were the American Football Conference (AFC) champions for the 2022 season. They finished the regular season with a record of 14-3, and defeated the Cincinnati Bengals in the AFC Championship game to earn a spot in Super Bowl LVII.\n\n### Philadelphia Eagles\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles were the National Football Conference (NFC) champions for the 2022 season. They finished the regular season with a record of 14-3, and defeated the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC Championship game to earn a spot in Super Bowl LVII.\n\n### Playoffs\n\nThe playoffs for Super Bowl LVII consisted of four games: the AFC Championship game and the NFC Championship game, which determined the participants in the Super Bowl, and two wild card games that determined the participants in the divisional round.\n\n### Pre-game notes\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles held a joint practice on February 9, 2023, at State Farm Stadium. The practice was attended by fans and media from both teams, and featured a series of drills and scrimmages.

The 13th and final spot was awarded to the top team from the 2021 European Curling Championships, held in Lillehammer, Norway.\n\n**Russian Participation**\n\nDue to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, the Russian team, skipped by Sergey Glukhov, was not allowed to participate in the 2022 World Men's Curling Championship as a result of a WCF ban on Russian teams. This decision was made in accordance with the WCF's Code of Ethics and Human Rights Policy.\n\n**Teams**\n\nThe 13 teams that competed in the 2022 World Men's Curling Championship were:\n\n1.

One notable change was the introduction of a \"freeze\" rule, which requires the lead stone to come to rest within a certain distance from the button in order to be considered \"in play.\" Another change was the reduction of the number of hammer throws in the 10th end from three to two.\n\n**Round-robin standings**\n\nThe round-robin standings for the 2022 World Men's Curling Championship were:\n\n1.

The election was the 38th parliamentary election since the establishment of the Riksdag in 1866.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe election was the culmination of a tumultuous period in Swedish politics, marked by the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, migration, and climate change. The outgoing government, led by Prime Minister Stefan Löfven, had been in office since 2014 and had implemented several key policies, including a national minimum wage and a ban on fur farming.\n\n### Löfven's government\n\nDuring its tenure, the Löfven government had also faced significant controversy, particularly regarding its handling of the migration crisis in 2015 and 2016, which saw a massive influx of asylum seekers arriving in Sweden. The government's decision to introduce a temporary migrant reception policy, known as the \"flyktingpeng\" (asylum seeker allowance), was widely criticized by opposition parties. The government also faced criticism for its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in the early stages of the outbreak.\n\n### Andersson's government\n\nIn June 2021, Stefan Löfven announced his resignation as Prime Minister, citing health reasons. Magdalena Andersson, the former Minister for Finance and leader of the Social Democratic Party, was elected as the new Prime Minister, becoming the first female Prime Minister of Sweden. The Andersson government inherited a challenging economic situation, with the country facing high inflation and a budget deficit.\n\n**Electoral system**\n\nThe 2022 Swedish general election was conducted using the proportional representation system, where voters cast ballots for a party list rather than individual candidates. The country is divided into 29 constituencies, each electing 30 members to the Riksdag. The election is considered a \"six-year parliament\" system, where members serve for a fixed six-year term.\n\n### Political parties\n\nThe main parties contesting the 2022 election were:\n\n* **Social Democratic Party** (S): Center-left\n* **Moderate Party** (M): Center-right\n* **Liberal Party** (L): Center-right\n* **Green Party** (MP): Center-left\n* **Christian Democrats** (KD): Center-right\n* **Sweden Democrats** (SD): Right-wing\n\n### Pre-election composition\n\nPrior to the election, the Riksdag consisted of 349 members, with the Social Democratic Party holding 116 seats, the Moderate Party 70, the Liberal Party 20, the Green Party 16, the Christian Democrats 22, and the Sweden Democrats 62.\n\n**Campaign**\n\nThe 2022 Swedish general election campaign was marked by several key issues, including the economy, migration, and climate change.\n\n### Issues\n\n* **Economy:** The economy was a major issue during the campaign, with the opposition parties criticizing the government's handling of the budget and taxation policy.\n* **Migration:** The migration crisis of 2015 and 2016 remained a contentious issue, with the opposition parties calling for stricter immigration laws.\n* **Climate change:** Climate change was a key issue during the campaign, with the government and opposition parties vying for support on their respective policies to reduce carbon emissions.\n\n### Party campaigns\n\nThe Social Democratic Party campaigned on a platform of increasing social welfare and investment in education and healthcare. The Moderate Party, on the other hand, focused on reducing taxes and increasing business investment. The Sweden Democrats campaigned on a platform of stricter immigration laws and reduced taxation.\n\n### Slogans\n\nThe main slogans used during the campaign were:\n\n* **Social Democratic Party:** \"A Strong Social Democratic Sweden\"\n* **Moderate Party:** \"A Prosperous Sweden\"\n* **Sweden Democrats:** \"Sweden First\"\n\n### Debates\n\nThe 2022 election campaign saw several TV debates, including a debate between the three main party leaders, Stefan Löfven (Social Democratic Party), Ulf Kristersson (Moderate Party), and Jimmie Åkesson (Sweden Democrats).\n\n**Opinion polls**\n\nOpinion polls in the run-up to the election showed a tight contest between the Social Democratic Party and the Moderate Party, with the Sweden Democrats and the Green Party also polling well.\n\n**Results**\n\nThe election results showed a significant shift in the balance of power in the Riksdag, with the Social Democratic Party losing 18 seats and the Moderate Party gaining 15 seats. The Sweden Democrats also made significant gains, increasing their seat count by 14.\n\n### By bloc\n\nThe election results by bloc were:\n\n* **Center-left:** 144 seats (41.4%)\n* **Center-right:** 154 seats (44.5%)\n* **Right-wing:** 51 seats (14.7%)\n\n### Voter demographics\n\nThe election results showed significant differences in voting patterns between different age groups and regions. Young people (18-24) voted overwhelmingly for the Social Democratic Party, while older voters (65+) preferred the Moderate Party.\n\n### By constituency\n\nThe election results by constituency were:\n\n* **Stockholm:** Social Democratic Party 27.4%, Moderate Party 22.1%, Sweden Democrats 14.5%\n* **Uppsala:** Social Democratic Party 30.4%, Moderate Party 21.5%, Sweden Democrats 13.2%\n* **Sörmland:** Moderate Party 29.4%, Social Democratic Party 24.5%, Sweden Democrats 15.1%\n\n### Seat distribution\n\nThe seat distribution in the Riksdag after the election was:\n\n* **Social Democratic Party:** 99 seats\n* **Moderate Party:** 116 seats\n* **Liberal Party:** 24 seats\n* **Green Party:** 18 seats\n* **Christian Democrats:** 22 seats\n* **Sweden Democrats:** 76 seats\n\n### Maps\n\nSeveral maps were published during the campaign to show the voting patterns by constituency.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe election results led to a significant shift in the balance of power in the Riksdag, with the Moderate Party emerging as the largest party. The Sweden Democrats also made significant gains, increasing their seat count by 14.\n\n### Government formation\n\nThe Moderate Party, led by Ulf Kristersson, attempted to form a government with the support of the Liberal Party and the Christian Democrats.

The town's strategic location on the coast made it a significant hub for trade, commerce, and exploration, attracting various groups and cultures throughout its history. This article explores the origins, development, and evolution of Lahaina, highlighting its history, geography, demographics, arts and culture, sports, and popular culture.\n\n**History**\n\n**Name**\n\n### Modern name, etymology and pronunciations\n\nLahaina is derived from the Hawaiian words \"la\" meaning \"cruel\" or \" cruel sea\" and \"haina\" meaning \"place\" or \"land\". The name is pronounced as \"lah-hah-nah\". The town's name reflects its early association with the sea and its role as a major port and trading center.\n\n### Ancient names\n\nBefore the arrival of European explorers, the area was known as \"Olowalu\" by the ancient Hawaiians, who considered it a sacred and spiritual place. The name \"Olowalu\" is still used today to refer to the area.\n\n**Early rulers**\n\nThe earliest known ruler of the Lahaina area was Paao, a Tahitian chief who arrived in Hawaii in the 12th century. Paao established a settlement on the island of Hawaii and later became the ruler of Maui. His descendants continued to rule the island, with the last king of Maui, Kamehameha I, conquering the island in 1795.\n\n**Western contact**\n\n### Kahekili II\n\nThe first European to visit Lahaina was the British explorer Captain James Cook in 1778. Cook's arrival marked the beginning of Western contact with the island, which had a profound impact on the native Hawaiian population. Kahekili II, the last king of Maui, was a skilled warrior and leader who resisted the influence of European explorers. He was known for his bravery and military prowess, and his legacy continues to be celebrated in Hawaii today.\n\n### Kamehameha I and Kamehameha II\n\nIn 1795, Kamehameha I, the founder of the Kingdom of Hawaii, conquered the island of Maui, including the Lahaina area. Kamehameha I established a new capital on the island of Hawaii and made Lahaina a major port and trading center. His son, Kamehameha II, continued his father's legacy and expanded the kingdom's borders.\n\n### Christian missionaries\n\nIn the early 19th century, Christian missionaries arrived in Hawaii, including the American Protestant missionary, Reverend Sheldon Dibble. The missionaries played a significant role in introducing Western customs, values, and education to the native Hawaiian population. They also helped to establish the first schools and churches in Hawaii.\n\n### Whaling\n\nDuring the 19th century, Lahaina became a major whaling port, with many whaling ships visiting the area to hunt and process whales. The whaling industry brought great wealth and prosperity to the town, but it also had a significant impact on the environment and the native Hawaiian population.\n\n### Kamehameha III\n\nKamehameha III, the third king of Hawaii, ruled from 1825 to 1854. He was a skilled diplomat and leader who worked to modernize and strengthen the kingdom. He also established the Kingdom of Hawaii's first constitution and introduced Western-style education and government to the islands.\n\n### 20th century\n\nIn the 20th century, Lahaina continued to evolve, with the town becoming a popular tourist destination. The construction of the Honoapiilani Highway in the 1950s made it easier for visitors to access the area, and the town's historic charm and cultural significance attracted tourists from around the world.\n\n**2023 wildfire**\n\nIn 2023, a devastating wildfire swept through Lahaina, destroying homes and businesses and forcing thousands of people to evacuate. The fire highlighted the need for greater investment in fire prevention and emergency services in the area.\n\n**Geography**\n\n**Climate**\n\nLahaina is located on the west coast of the island of Maui, about 30 miles northwest of Kahului. The town's climate is tropical, with high temperatures and humidity throughout the year. The area receives most of its rainfall during the winter months, with the dry season running from May to October.\n\n**Demographics**\n\nAs of the 2020 census, the population of Lahaina was approximately 11,000 people. The town has a diverse population, with people from all over the world living and working in the area. The median household income is around $60,000, and the median home value is around $500,000.\n\n**Arts and culture**\n\nLahaina has a rich and vibrant arts and culture scene, with numerous galleries, museums, and performance venues. The town is home to the Lahaina Heritage Trail, a self-guided tour that explores the area's history and cultural significance. Visitors can also experience the town's unique blend of Hawaiian, European, and Asian cultures by attending one of the many festivals and events held throughout the year.\n\n**Sports**\n\nLahaina is a popular destination for outdoor enthusiasts, with numerous opportunities for surfing, snorkeling, and other water sports. The town is also home to the Lahaina Pali Trail, a challenging hike that offers stunning views of the coastline and surrounding landscape.\n\n**Popular culture**\n\nLahaina has been featured in numerous films and television shows, including the popular TV series \"Hawaii Five-0\" and the movie \"The Descendants\". The town's historic charm and cultural significance have made it a popular setting for movies and TV shows.\n\n**Gallery**\n\n* Image: Lahaina, Hawaii (2020)\n* Image: Lahaina Heritage Trail\n* Image: Lahaina Pali Trail\n* Image: Surfing in Lahaina\n\n**See also**\n\n* History of Hawaii\n* Kingdom of Hawaii\n* Hawaiian culture\n* Lahaina Heritage Trail\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is a comprehensive overview of the history, geography, demographics, arts and culture, sports, and popular culture of Lahaina, Hawaii.\n* The article is based on publicly available information and is intended to provide a neutral and informative account of the town's history and significance.\n\n**References**\n\n* This article does not include any references, as it is intended to be a neutral and informative overview of the topic.\n\n**External links**\n\n* Lahaina, Hawaii official website\n* Lahaina Heritage Trail\n* Lahaina Pali Trail", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

Established in 1991, the award is presented annually by the Commission des Grandes Voies (CGV) of the Club Alpin Français (CAF) and the International Federation of Mountaneering Associations (UIAA). The award is considered one of the most prestigious honors in the field of alpine climbing.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Piolets d'Or was created in 1991 by the CGV and the CAF to recognize and celebrate outstanding achievements in alpine climbing. The award is named after the \"Piolet d'Or\" award, which was first presented in 1976 to honor the outstanding achievements of climbers who had summited the most difficult routes in the Alps. Over the years, the Piolets d'Or has evolved to become a more comprehensive award that recognizes a wide range of climbing achievements.\n\nMultiple winners\n\nSince its inception, the Piolets d'Or has been awarded to several climbers who have made significant contributions to the field of alpine climbing. Some notable winners include:\n\n* Reinhold Messner, the first person to climb all 14 eight-thousanders\n* Ueli Steck, a Swiss climber who was known for his speed and efficiency on the mountain\n* Pip Hare, a British climber who has made several first ascents in the Alps and the Himalayas\n* Alex Honnold, an American climber who is known for his free solo ascents of difficult routes\n\nCriteria\n\nThe Piolets d'Or is awarded to climbers who have made significant contributions to the field of alpine climbing. The award is given to climbers who have achieved outstanding results in climbing, mountaineering, or ski mountaineering. The selection process involves a committee of experts who review the achievements of climbers and select the winners.\n\nThe selection committee considers a wide range of factors when selecting the winners, including:\n\n* The difficulty of the climb\n* The speed and efficiency of the ascent\n* The risk involved in the climb\n* The contribution to the field of alpine climbing\n\nReception\n\nThe Piolets d'Or is widely recognized as one of the most prestigious awards in the field of alpine climbing. The award is considered a great honor and is often seen as a career highlight for climbers. Many climbers have credited the Piolets d'Or with inspiring them to pursue a career in climbing.\n\nHowever, some climbers have criticized the award for being too focused on individual achievements and not enough on the environmental and social impact of climbing. Others have argued that the award is too biased towards climbers from Europe and the United States, and not enough towards climbers from other parts of the world.\n\nCriticism\n\nSome climbers have criticized the Piolets d'Or for being too focused on individual achievements and not enough on the environmental and social impact of climbing.

It was established by the Holy Roman Empire in 1678, following the conquest of the region from the Ottoman Empire.\n\n**History**\n\n### Austrian Conquest\n\nIn 1678, the Holy Roman Empire, under the leadership of Emperor Leopold I, launched a military campaign against the Ottoman Empire, which had controlled the region for centuries. The campaign was successful, and the Ottomans were forced to cede significant territories to the Habsburgs. The Banat of Craiova was one of the regions that fell under Austrian control.\n\n### Government Creation\n\nFollowing the conquest, the Austrians established a government in the Banat of Craiova. The region was divided into several counties, each governed by a local administrator. The capital of the Banat of Craiova was the city of Craiova, which became an important center of commerce and trade.\n\n### Boyar and Peasant Resistance\n\nThe establishment of the Banat of Craiova was met with resistance from the local boyar class, who had long been the dominant elite in the region. The boyars saw the Austrian conquest as a threat to their power and privileges, and they resisted the new government's attempts to impose its authority. The peasants, who made up the majority of the population, also resisted the Austrian rule, seeing it as an opportunity to gain greater autonomy and freedom.\n\n### Austrian Consolidation\n\nDespite the initial resistance, the Austrians were able to consolidate their control over the Banat of Craiova. They implemented a series of reforms aimed at modernizing the region's infrastructure and economy. The Austrians also established a new system of taxation, which helped to increase revenue and fund the costs of administration.\n\n### Ottoman Reconquest\n\nIn 1688, the Ottoman Empire launched a counterattack against the Austrians, seeking to retake the territories that had been lost in the previous campaign. The Ottomans were successful in their efforts, and the Banat of Craiova was reconquered. The region remained under Ottoman control for several decades, until it was finally ceded to the Habsburgs in the Treaty of Passarowitz in 1718.\n\n**Legacy**\n\n### \"Colonial\" Precedent\n\nThe Banat of Craiova can be seen as a precursor to the colonial practices of European powers in the modern era. The Austrians' establishment of a government in the region, despite the presence of a local elite, set a precedent for the imposition of foreign rule on colonized territories.\n\n### Cultural Survivals\n\nDespite the relatively short duration of the Banat of Craiova, the region's cultural heritage has survived to this day. The city of Craiova, which was once the capital of the Banat, remains an important cultural center in Romania. The region's architecture, cuisine, and traditions continue to be celebrated and preserved by local communities.\n\n**Symbols**\n\nThe Banat of Craiova did not have an official coat of arms or flag, as it was a short-lived state that did not have a permanent government. However, the region's cultural heritage continues to be celebrated through various symbols, including the city's emblem, which features a buck's head and a pair of antlers.\n\n**Notes**\n\nThe Banat of Craiova was a significant episode in the history of the region, marking the transition from Ottoman to Habsburg rule. The region's cultural heritage continues to be celebrated and preserved by local communities, and its legacy can be seen in the modern-day cultural practices and traditions of the region.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The election was the 15th general election in the history of Malaysia and was held to elect members of the Dewan Rakyat, the lower house of the Parliament of Malaysia.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Previous election\n\nThe 14th Malaysian general election was held on 9 May 2018. The Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition, led by Mahathir Mohamad, won a majority of the seats in the Dewan Rakyat, defeating the Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition, which had been in power for 61 years. The PH coalition won 113 out of 222 seats in the Dewan Rakyat, while the BN coalition won 79 seats.\n\n### Significant events\n\nSince the 2018 general election, Malaysia has experienced a series of significant events that have impacted the country's politics. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic hit Malaysia, leading to a state of emergency and the suspension of Parliament. The pandemic also led to economic difficulties, including a recession and a significant increase in unemployment.\n\n### 2020–22 political crisis\n\nIn 2020, a series of events led to a political crisis in Malaysia. In February 2020, the Malaysian government announced a state of emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The emergency was initially set to last six months, but it was later extended indefinitely. The emergency led to the suspension of Parliament, and the government was given sweeping powers to pass laws without parliamentary approval.\n\nIn 2021, the Malaysian government was rocked by a series of scandals, including the 1MDB scandal, which involved the theft of billions of dollars from the state-owned 1MDB development fund. The scandal led to the resignation of several high-ranking government officials, including the Prime Minister, Muhyiddin Yassin.\n\n**Electoral system**\n\nMalaysia uses a first-past-the-post electoral system, where the candidate with the most votes in a constituency wins the seat. The country is divided into 222 constituencies, each representing a different geographic area. The Dewan Rakyat has 222 members, who are elected by the people of Malaysia through a secret ballot.\n\n**Timeline**\n\n### Dissolution of parliament\n\nOn 10 October 2022, the Malaysian King, Sultan Abdullah Sultan Ahmad Shah, dissolved Parliament, paving the way for a general election. The dissolution was made following a request from the Prime Minister, Ismail Sabri Yaakob, who had been in power since August 2021.\n\n### Dissolution of state legislatures\n\nOn 11 October 2022, the King also dissolved the state legislatures of Perlis, Kedah, Kelantan, Terengganu, Pahang, and Sabah, which were also dissolved in preparation for the general election.\n\n### Pre-nomination events\n\nBefore the general election, several events took place, including the nomination of candidates and the campaigning by political parties. The nomination process began on 15 October 2022, and ended on 22 October 2022. During this period, candidates from various parties were nominated to contest in the general election.\n\n### Timetable\n\nThe general election was held on 19 November 2022. The voting process began at 8:00 am and ended at 5:00 pm. The counting of votes began immediately after the polling stations closed, and the results were announced in the evening.\n\n**Last election pendulum**\n\nBefore the general election, several analysts and pollsters released their last election pendulum, which predicted the outcome of the election. The pendulum, also known as the \"electoral pendulum\", is a statistical tool used to predict the outcome of elections based on past voting patterns.\n\n**Political parties and candidates**\n\n### Parties represented in current legislatures\n\nSeveral parties were represented in the current legislatures, including the Perikatan Nasional (PN) coalition, the Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition, and the Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition. The PN coalition was formed in 2020 and is led by Muhyiddin Yassin. The PH coalition was formed in 2018 and is led by Anwar Ibrahim. The BN coalition was formed in 1974 and is led by Ahmad Zahid Hamidi.\n\n### Extra-parliamentary parties\n\nSeveral extra-parliamentary parties contested in the general election, including the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS), the Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA), and the Democratic Action Party (DAP).\n\n### Nominated candidates\n\nA total of 1,081 candidates were nominated to contest in the general election. The candidates included 444 from the PN coalition, 413 from the PH coalition, 213 from the BN coalition, and 111 from the extra-parliamentary parties.\n\n**Campaign**\n\n### Timing of election\n\nThe general election was held on 19 November 2022, which was a Saturday. The election was announced on 10 October 2022, and the nomination process began on 15 October 2022.\n\n### Youth vote\n\nThe youth vote was a significant factor in the general election. The Malaysian youth, who make up a significant portion of the population, was a key target for political parties. Several parties launched campaigns to attract the youth vote, including offering scholarships and job opportunities.\n\n**Outgoing members of parliament**\n\nA total of 222 members of Parliament were elected in the general election. The outgoing members of Parliament included 117 from the PN coalition, 84 from the PH coalition, and 21 from the BN coalition.\n\n**Opinion polls**\n\nSeveral opinion polls were conducted before the general election, including a poll by the Malaysian Institute of Democracy and Elections (MIDE). The poll predicted that the PH coalition would win the most seats, followed by the PN coalition and the BN coalition.\n\n**Results**\n\n### By alliance\n\nThe results of the general election were as follows:\n\n* Perikatan Nasional (PN) coalition: 71 seats\n* Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition: 89 seats\n* Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition: 30 seats\n* Extra-parliamentary parties: 32 seats\n\n### By parliamentary seats\n\nThe results of the general election by parliamentary seat were as follows:\n\n* PN coalition: 71 seats\n* PH coalition: 89 seats\n* BN coalition: 30 seats\n* Extra-parliamentary parties: 32 seats\n\n### State assemblies\n\nThe results of the general election by state assembly were as follows:\n\n* Perlis: PN coalition: 12 seats, PH coalition: 3 seats, BN coalition: 1 seat\n* Kedah: PN coalition: 25 seats, PH coalition: 11 seats, BN coalition: 0 seats\n* Kelantan: PAS: 38 seats, PN coalition: 1 seat, PH coalition: 0 seats\n* Terengganu: PN coalition: 23 seats, PH coalition: 1 seat, BN coalition: 0 seats\n* Pahang: PN coalition: 23 seats, PH coalition: 1 seat, BN coalition: 0 seats\n* Selangor: PH coalition: 42 seats, PN coalition: 5 seats, BN coalition: 0 seats\n* Negeri Sembilan: PH coalition: 18 seats, PN coalition: 3 seats, BN coalition: 0 seats\n* Malacca: PH coalition: 12 seats, PN coalition: 4 seats, BN coalition: 0 seats\n* Johor: PN coalition: 27 seats, PH coalition: 10 seats, BN coalition: 0 seats\n* Sarawak: PN coalition: 27 seats, PH coalition: 4 seats, BN coalition: 0 seats\n* Sabah: PN coalition: 33 seats, PH coalition: 8 seats, BN coalition: 0 seats\n* Kuala Lumpur: PH coalition: 11 seats, PN coalition: 3 seats, BN coalition: 0 seats\n* Labuan: PN coalition: 1 seat, PH coalition: 1 seat, BN coalition: 0 seats\n\n### Seats that changed allegiance\n\nA total of 49 seats changed allegiance in the general election, including 31 from the PN coalition, 12 from the PH coalition, and 6 from the BN coalition.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\n### Formation of federal government\n\nAfter the general election, the Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition, led by Anwar Ibrahim, formed the federal government.
