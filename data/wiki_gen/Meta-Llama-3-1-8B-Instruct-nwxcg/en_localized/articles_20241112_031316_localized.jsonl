This can occur through various means, including missionary work, individual conversion, and the spread of Christianity through imperial or colonial power.\n\n**Missions**\n\nChristian missions have played a significant role in the spread of Christianity throughout history. Missionaries have traveled to various parts of the world, often at great personal risk, to convert people to Christianity. The earliest Christian missionaries were the apostles, who were sent by Jesus Christ to spread his teachings to the world. Later, Christian missionaries were instrumental in the conversion of various regions, including Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas.\n\n**Individual Conversion**\n\nIndividual conversion to Christianity often involves a personal decision to accept the teachings of Jesus Christ and to follow the Christian faith. This can occur through various means, including baptism, eucharist, and confirmation.\n\n### **Baptism**\n\nBaptism is the sacrament by which a person is initiated into the Christian faith. It involves the use of water, symbolizing the washing away of sin and the reception of new life in Christ. Baptism is usually performed by immersion or sprinkling, and is often accompanied by a profession of faith and a commitment to live a Christian life.\n\n### **Eucharist**\n\nThe eucharist is a sacrament in which Christians partake of bread and wine, symbolizing the body and blood of Christ. The eucharist is a celebration of the Last Supper, in which Jesus instituted the sacrament as a reminder of his love and sacrifice for humanity. The eucharist is an important part of Christian worship and is often celebrated in churches around the world.\n\n### **Confirmation**\n\nConfirmation is a sacrament in which a person is confirmed in their faith and receives the gift of the Holy Spirit. It is often performed by a bishop or other ordained minister, and involves the laying on of hands and the recitation of prayers. Confirmation is a celebration of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, which occurred on the day of Pentecost, and is a reminder of the power of God to transform and empower believers.\n\n**Places and Practices**\n\nChristianization has occurred in various forms and to varying degrees in different parts of the world. Some regions have been more successful in adopting Christianity, while others have resisted or even destroyed Christian artifacts and institutions.\n\n### **Temple Conversion within Roman Empire**\n\nDuring the Roman Empire, many temples were converted into Christian churches. This process involved the destruction of pagan idols and the installation of Christian symbols and artifacts. The conversion of temples was often a gradual process, with Christians initially using the temples for worship and later converting them into churches.\n\n### **Temple and Icon Destruction**\n\nIn some regions, Christianization was accompanied by the destruction of pagan temples and icons. This was often seen as a way to purge the region of pagan influences and to establish Christianity as the dominant faith.

Founded in 1826, it is one of the largest and most prestigious universities in the UK. UCL is a member of the prestigious Russell Group, a network of research-intensive universities in the UK, and is a constituent college of the University of London.\n\nHistory\n\n### 1826 to 1836 – London University\n\nUCL was founded in 1826 as London University, with the aim of providing higher education to students from all backgrounds. The university was established by a group of reformers, including Lord Brougham and Jeremy Bentham, who sought to create a institution that was open to students of all social classes. The university's first campus was located in Gower Street, Bloomsbury, and its first students began attending classes in 1828.\n\n### 1836 to 1900 – University College, London\n\nIn 1836, the university was renamed University College, London (UCL). During this period, UCL underwent significant expansion, with the establishment of new faculties and departments. The university's curriculum was also expanded to include a wider range of subjects, including law, medicine, and engineering. UCL's student body also grew during this period, with the number of students increasing from just over 100 in 1836 to over 1,000 by 1880.\n\n### 1900 to 1976 – University of London, University College\n\nIn 1900, UCL became a constituent college of the University of London, a federal university that was established to provide a framework for higher education in the UK. During this period, UCL continued to expand, with the establishment of new faculties and departments, including the Faculties of Arts and Sciences, and the Institute of Education. UCL's research output also increased during this period, with the establishment of several research institutes and centers.\n\n### 1976 to 2005 – University College London\n\nIn 1976, UCL was granted university status, and its name was changed to University College London (UCL). During this period, UCL underwent significant modernization, with the establishment of new facilities and infrastructure. The university's research output also increased, with the establishment of several new research centers and institutes. UCL's student body also grew during this period, with the number of students increasing from just over 10,000 in 1976 to over 25,000 by 2005.\n\n### From 2005\n\nSince 2005, UCL has continued to expand, with the establishment of new faculties and departments, including the Faculties of Engineering and Informatics, and the Institute of Health and Society. The university's research output has also increased, with the establishment of several new research centers and institutes. UCL has also invested heavily in its campus, with the establishment of several new facilities and infrastructure.\n\nCampus and locations\n\n### Bloomsbury\n\nUCL's main campus is located in Bloomsbury, a district of central London. The campus is home to several of the university's faculties and departments, including the Faculties of Arts and Sciences, and the Institute of Education. The campus is also home to several of the university's museums and galleries, including the Grant Museum of Zoology and the Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology.\n\n### UCL East\n\nIn 2020, UCL announced plans to establish a new campus in Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, Stratford, London.

The outbreak began in April 2022 and has since spread to multiple countries, resulting in a significant number of cases and deaths.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Emergency Preparedness Prior to Outbreak\n\nPrior to the outbreak, many countries had emergency preparedness plans in place to address potential public health crises. These plans typically included protocols for surveillance, contact tracing, and containment of infectious diseases. While mpox was not a major concern at the time, the global health community had learned valuable lessons from previous outbreaks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and was better equipped to respond to emerging health threats.\n\n### Endemic Mpox in Africa\n\nMpox has been endemic in certain regions of Africa for decades, particularly in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Republic of Congo, and Cameroon. The virus was first identified in 1970, and since then, there have been sporadic outbreaks and cases reported in the region. However, the 2022–2023 outbreak marked a significant increase in cases and spread beyond Africa, prompting a global response.\n\n**Outbreak Characteristics**\n\n### Phylogenetics\n\nThe 2022–2023 mpox outbreak was caused by a distinct clade of the mpox virus, which is different from the strains that have been circulating in Africa. The new clade has been identified as a recombinant strain, meaning it has recombined with other viruses to create a new genetic sequence. This has raised concerns about the potential for the virus to adapt and evolve over time.\n\n### Long Incubation Periods\n\nOne of the distinctive features of the 2022–2023 mpox outbreak is the long incubation period of the virus. In some cases, individuals have reported symptoms taking up to 14 days to appear after exposure. This long incubation period has made contact tracing and containment efforts challenging, as individuals may not realize they have been infected until after they have already spread the virus to others.\n\n### Mild Clinical Manifestations\n\nIn contrast to other viral infections, such as COVID-19, mpox is characterized by mild clinical manifestations. The virus typically causes skin lesions, fever, and swollen lymph nodes, but in most cases, these symptoms are not severe enough to require hospitalization. This has led some to underestimate the potential severity of the outbreak, but the virus's ability to spread rapidly and cause significant morbidity cannot be ignored.\n\n### Fear of Zoonotic Spread\n\nOne of the concerns surrounding the 2022–2023 mpox outbreak is the potential for zoonotic spread, meaning the virus could jump from animals to humans. While there is no evidence to suggest that animals are a significant source of infection, the possibility of zoonotic transmission has raised concerns among public health officials and scientists.\n\n**Chronology**\n\n### Deaths Outside of Africa\n\nThe first deaths outside of Africa were reported in the United States in May 2022, followed by several other countries, including Canada, the United Kingdom, and Brazil. As of August 2023, there have been over 100 reported deaths in non-African countries.\n\n**Transmission**\n\n### Transmission Patterns\n\nThe 2022–2023 mpox outbreak has been characterized by a complex transmission pattern, with cases reported in both individuals who have recently traveled to areas where the virus is endemic and those who have not. The virus has also been detected in healthcare workers, suggesting that there may be ongoing transmission in healthcare settings.\n\n### Wastewater Surveillance\n\nWastewater surveillance has played a critical role in detecting and tracking the spread of mpox. By analyzing wastewater samples for the presence of the virus, public health officials have been able to identify areas where the virus is circulating and take targeted measures to contain the outbreak.\n\n**Interventions**\n\n### Testing and Containment\n\nTesting and containment have been critical components of the response to the 2022–2023 mpox outbreak. Public health officials have implemented widespread testing to identify individuals who have been infected and contain the virus to prevent further spread. This has included contact tracing, quarantine, and isolation of affected individuals.\n\n### Vaccination\n\nSeveral vaccines have been developed to protect against mpox, and vaccination efforts have been underway in several countries. While vaccination is an important tool for preventing the spread of the virus, it is not a guarantee against infection, and public health officials continue to emphasize the importance of adherence to public health measures, such as wearing masks and practicing good hygiene.\n\n**Social Aspects**\n\n### Misinformation\n\nThe 2022–2023 mpox outbreak has been accompanied by a significant amount of misinformation and stigma surrounding the virus. This has led to confusion and anxiety among the public, as well as a delay in seeking medical attention when symptoms appear. Public health officials and social media platforms have been working to provide accurate information and promote clear messaging around the outbreak.\n\n**Responses**\n\n### World Health Organization\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has played a critical role in the global response to the 2022–2023 mpox outbreak. The WHO has provided technical guidance, supported surveillance and contact tracing efforts, and advocated for equitable access to vaccination and treatment.\n\n### Countries\n\nCountries have responded to the outbreak in a variety of ways, with some implementing strict public health measures, such as lockdowns and mask mandates, while others have taken a more relaxed approach. Public health officials and government leaders have faced significant challenges in balancing the need to contain the outbreak with the need to protect the economy and individual freedoms.\n\n### Dependent Territories\n\nDependent territories, such as Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands, have also been affected by the 2022–2023 mpox outbreak. These territories have faced unique challenges in responding to the outbreak, including limited resources and infrastructure.\n\n**Cases per Country and Territory**\n\nAs of August 2023, there have been reported cases of mpox in over 100 countries and territories around the world. The following table provides a rough breakdown of the number of cases by country and territory:\n\n| Country/Territory | Number of Cases | Number of Deaths |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| United States | 20,000 | 200 |\n| Canada | 5,000 | 50 |\n| United Kingdom | 2,000 | 20 |\n| Brazil | 1,000 | 10 |\n| Australia | 500 | 5 |\n| Germany | 300 | 3 |\n| France | 200 | 2 |\n| China | 100 | 1 |\n| Japan | 50 | 1 |\n\n**Timeline of First Confirmed Cases by Country or Territory**\n\nThe following table provides a rough breakdown of the first confirmed cases of mpox by country and territory:\n\n| Country/Territory | Date of First Confirmed Case |\n| --- | --- |\n| United States | May 6, 2022 |\n| Canada | May 10, 2022 |\n| United Kingdom | May 15, 2022 |\n| Brazil | May 20, 2022 |\n| Australia | May 25, 2022 |\n| Germany | June 1, 2022 |\n| France | June 5, 2022 |\n| China | June 10, 2022 |\n| Japan | June 15, 2022 |\n\n**Timeline of Suspected Cases by Country or Territory**\n\nThe following table provides a rough breakdown of the suspected cases of mpox by country and territory:\n\n| Country/Territory | Date of First Suspected Case |\n| --- | --- |\n| United States | April 21, 2022 |\n| Canada | April 25, 2022 |\n| United Kingdom | April 30, 2022 |\n| Brazil | May 5, 2022 |\n| Australia | May 10, 2022 |\n| Germany | May 15, 2022 |\n| France | May 20, 2022 |\n| China | May 25, 2022 |\n| Japan | May 30, 2022 |\n\n**Timeline of First Deaths by Country or Territory (in countries with initial 2022 detection from 6 May onwards)**\n\nThe following table provides a rough breakdown of the first deaths associated with mpox by country and territory:\n\n| Country/Territory | Date of First Death |\n| --- | --- |\n| United States | May 22, 2022 |\n| Canada | May 25, 2022 |\n| United Kingdom | May 30, 2022 |\n| Brazil | June 5, 2022 |\n| Australia | June 10, 2022 |\n| Germany | June 15, 2022 |\n| France | June 20, 2022 |\n| China | June 25, 2022 |\n| Japan | June 30, 2022 |\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Mpox\n* COVID-19 pandemic\n* Vaccination\n* Public health\n* Contact tracing\n* Quarantine\n* Isolation\n\n**References**\n\nThis article has no references.\n\n**External Links**\n\n* World Health Organization (WHO) - Mpox\n* Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) - Mpox\n* World Health Organization (WHO) - Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN)\n* Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) - Mpox (monkeypox) resources", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

He is widely considered one of the greatest mathematicians of all time, and his work had a profound impact on the development of mathematics and science.\n\n### Biography\n\n#### Youth and Education\n\nGauss was born in Braunschweig, Germany, to a family of modest means. His father, Gebhard Dietrich Gauss, was a gardener and a musician, while his mother, Dorothea Benze, was a washerwoman. Gauss's early education was provided by his father, who recognized his son's exceptional mathematical abilities and encouraged him to pursue his interests. In 1788, Gauss began his formal education at the Braunschweig Collegium Carolinum, where he excelled in mathematics and was particularly drawn to the works of Leonhard Euler.\n\n#### Private Scholar\n\nGauss's mathematical abilities were already evident by the time he was 10 years old. He was largely self-taught, and his education was interrupted by the death of his father in 1791. Despite these challenges, Gauss continued to study mathematics on his own, and by the time he was 14, he had already made significant contributions to the field of mathematics. His family's financial situation improved when his mother remarried, but Gauss's relationship with his stepfather was strained.\n\n#### Professor in Göttingen\n\nIn 1795, Gauss was awarded a scholarship to the University of Göttingen, where he studied mathematics and physics under the guidance of Abraham Kästner. During his time at Göttingen, Gauss began to develop his mathematical theories, including his work on the fundamental theorem of algebra. He also became acquainted with the work of other prominent mathematicians, including Joseph-Louis Lagrange and Adrien-Marie Legendre.\n\n#### Gauss's Brain\n\nGauss's brain was preserved after his death and is now on display at the University of Göttingen. It is said to have been removed by his wife, Minna, who was a skilled anatomist. The brain is notable for its unusual size and structure, which is said to be consistent with the exceptional mathematical abilities of its owner.\n\n#### Family\n\nGauss married Johanna Osthoff in 1805, but she died in 1809, shortly after giving birth to their second child. Gauss was devastated by her death and never remarried. He had four children with Johanna, and his family played an important role in his life.\n\n#### Personality\n\n#### Scholar\n\nGauss was a prolific mathematician and scientist who made significant contributions to many fields. He was known for his exceptional mathematical abilities, which were evident from an early age. His work on the fundamental theorem of algebra, the discovery of the method of least squares, and his contributions to number theory are just a few examples of his many achievements.\n\n#### Private Man\n\nGauss was a private person who kept to himself, but he was not antisocial. He was known to be a kind and generous person who was loved by his family and colleagues. He was also a skilled musician and enjoyed playing the lyre and the violin.\n\n### Scientific Work\n\n#### Algebra and Number Theory\n\nGauss's work on algebra and number theory is considered some of his most significant contributions to mathematics. His book, \"Disquisitiones Arithmeticae,\" is considered a classic in the field and had a profound impact on the development of number theory.\n\n#### Fundamental Theorem of Algebra\n\nGauss's work on the fundamental theorem of algebra is considered one of his most significant contributions to mathematics.

It is organized by the Indonesian Football Federation (PSSI) and is the highest level of football in Indonesia. The league was established in 1994 and has undergone several changes in its format and structure over the years.\n\n# History\n\n## Origins\n\nThe idea of establishing a top-level football league in Indonesia dates back to the 1920s, when the Dutch colonial authorities organized the first national football championships. However, it was not until the 1990s that the PSSI began to take steps to establish a professional league. In 1994, the PSSI launched the Liga Indonesia, which was initially composed of 18 teams.\n\n## Foundation\n\nThe Liga Indonesia was founded on August 14, 1994, with the aim of creating a professional league that would attract top players and teams from across the country. The league was initially divided into two conferences: the West and East conferences, each with nine teams. The top two teams from each conference would qualify for the championship playoffs.\n\n## Dualism\n\nIn the early years of the Liga Indonesia, the league was plagued by dualism, with some teams refusing to compete in the league due to disagreements over the league's structure and governance. The dualism issue was eventually resolved in 2002, when the PSSI introduced a new league format that eliminated the dualism problem.\n\n## Government intervention and FIFA suspension\n\nIn 2015, the Indonesian government intervened in the league, imposing a new format and governance structure on the PSSI. However, the move was opposed by many in the football community, and the PSSI was eventually suspended by FIFA in August 2015. The suspension was lifted in 2016, and the PSSI was allowed to resume its activities.\n\n## Name change\n\nIn 2020, the PSSI announced that it would be changing the name of the league from Liga Indonesia to Liga 1. The name change was made to reflect the league's new format and to attract more international attention and sponsorship.\n\n# Competition format\n\n## Competition\n\nThe Liga 1 is a double round-robin competition, with 18 teams competing in each season. The top four teams at the end of the season qualify for the championship playoffs, while the bottom four teams are relegated to the Liga 2. The playoffs are played in a two-legged format, with the winners qualifying for the AFC Champions League.\n\n## Promotion and relegation\n\nTeams that finish in the top four positions at the end of the season are promoted to the Liga 1, while teams that finish in the bottom four positions are relegated to the Liga 2. The top three teams in the Liga 2 also qualify for the Liga 1 playoffs.\n\n## Video assistant referee\n\nThe Liga 1 introduced video assistant referee (VAR) technology in 2019 to improve the accuracy of refereeing decisions. The VAR system is used to review goals, penalties, and other critical decisions.\n\n# Clubs\n\n## Champions\n\nThe Liga 1 has been won by several teams since its inception, including:\n\n* PSMS Medan (1995)\n* Persebaya Surabaya (1998)\n* Persib Bandung (2000)\n* PSIS Semarang (2004)\n* Arema Malang (2015)\n* Bali United (2019)\n\n## Performance by clubs\n\nThe following table shows the performance of the top teams in the Liga 1 since its inception:\n\n| Team | Titles | Runners-up | Third-place finishes |\n| PSMS Medan | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n| Persebaya Surabaya | 1 | 2 | 1 |\n| Persib Bandung | 1 | 1 | 2 |\n| PSIS Semarang | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n| Arema Malang | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n| Bali United | 1 | 1 | 0 |\n\n## 2024–25 season\n\nThe 2024–25 Liga 1 season is expected to feature 18 teams competing in a double round-robin format. The top four teams will qualify for the championship playoffs, while the bottom four teams will be relegated to the Liga 2.\n\n### Maps\n\nThe following maps show the locations of the teams in the Liga 1:\n\n* Java: 10 teams\n\t+ East Java: 4 teams\n\t+ West Java: 3 teams\n\t+ Central Java: 2 teams\n\t+ Yogyakarta: 1 team\n* Sumatra: 4 teams\n\t+ North Sumatra: 2 teams\n\t+ South Sumatra: 1 team\n\t+ Riau: 1 team\n\n## Former clubs\n\nSeveral teams have been relegated from the Liga 1 in recent years, including:\n\n* Persikabo 1973\n* Barito Putera\n* PS Barito Putera\n* Persela Lamongan\n* PS TNI\n\n## All-time Liga 1 table\n\nThe following table shows the all-time performance of teams in the Liga 1:\n\n| Team | Appearances | Titles | Runners-up | Third-place finishes |\n| PSMS Medan | 20 | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n| Persebaya Surabaya | 18 | 1 | 2 | 1 |\n| Persib Bandung | 16 | 1 | 1 | 2 |\n| PSIS Semarang | 14 | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n| Arema Malang | 12 | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n| Bali United | 6 | 1 | 1 | 0 |\n\n# Foreign players\n\nThe Liga 1 has attracted several foreign players over the years, including:\n\n* Hamzah Fanana (Senegal)\n* Oscar Lapola (Brazil)\n* Clayton (Brazil)\n* Beto (Brazil)\n* Germano Vidal (Brazil)\n* Gegy (Brazil)\n* M.

Robert Oppenheimer, the director of the Manhattan Project. The film is directed by Christopher Nolan and written by Nolan and his brother Jonathan. It stars Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer, alongside Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., Florence Pugh, Benny Safdie, Rami Malek, and Alden Ehrenreich in supporting roles.\n\nPlot\n\nThe film is a sprawling epic that spans decades, from Oppenheimer's early days as a theoretical physicist to his role as the director of the Manhattan Project during World War II. Along the way, it explores the complexities of Oppenheimer's personal life, including his relationships with his wife Kitty (Emily Blunt) and his mistress Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh). The film also delves into the moral implications of the atomic bomb and the toll it takes on Oppenheimer's mental and emotional well-being.\n\nAs the war draws to a close, Oppenheimer becomes increasingly disillusioned with the use of the bomb, which he had helped to create. He begins to question the ethics of the project and the motivations of those who are pushing for its use. The film culminates in a dramatic and intense confrontation between Oppenheimer and the government officials who are demanding that he reveal the secrets of the bomb.\n\nCast\n\n* Cillian Murphy as J.

Nolan was drawn to the story of Oppenheimer's life, particularly his role as the director of the Manhattan Project. He saw an opportunity to explore the complexities of Oppenheimer's character and the historical events that shaped his life.\n\nWriting\n\nThe screenplay for Oppenheimer was written by Nolan and his brother Jonathan. The script went through numerous drafts, with Nolan working closely with his brother to develop the story and characters. The script was also influenced by Nolan's own research on the subject, including his reading of Oppenheimer's letters and diaries.\n\nCasting\n\nThe casting process for Oppenheimer began in 2018, with Cillian Murphy being the first actor to be attached to the project. Murphy was a longtime friend of Nolan's, and the two had previously worked together on the film Inception. Murphy was drawn to the role of Oppenheimer, seeing it as a chance to explore the complexities of the character.\n\nFlorence Pugh was cast as Jean Tatlock, Oppenheimer's mistress, and Emily Blunt was cast as Kitty Oppenheimer, Oppenheimer's wife. The two actresses brought a level of depth and nuance to their roles, which helped to bring the film to life.\n\nFilming\n\nFilming for Oppenheimer began in September 2021 and lasted for several months. The film was shot on a combination of IMAX and 65mm film, which gave it a unique and cinematic look. The film was shot on location in the United States, including in the state of New Mexico, where the Manhattan Project was based.\n\nPost-production\n\nPost-production on Oppenheimer was a long and laborious process. Nolan and his team worked tirelessly to edit the film, using a combination of digital and analog techniques to shape the narrative. The film's score was composed by Ludwig Göransson, who worked closely with Nolan to create a haunting and atmospheric soundtrack.\n\nMusic\n\nThe music for Oppenheimer was composed by Ludwig Göransson, who worked closely with Nolan to create a haunting and atmospheric soundtrack. The score features a combination of orchestral and choral elements, which help to bring the film's narrative to life.\n\nMarketing\n\nThe marketing campaign for Oppenheimer was extensive, with Warner Bros. releasing a series of promotional materials, including trailers and posters. The film's trailer was released in June 2023, and it quickly went viral, generating widespread buzz and excitement.\n\nRelease\n\nTheatrical\n\nOppenheimer was released in theaters on July 21, 2023, in a limited release. The film played well in art house theaters, where it received positive reviews from critics and audiences alike. The film's wide release followed in August 2023, and it quickly became a box office hit.\n\nClassifications and censorship\n\nOppenheimer was classified as a PG-13 film by the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) for its mature themes and some violence. The film's rating was not without controversy, with some critics and viewers feeling that it was too soft on the subject matter.\n\nHome media\n\nOppenheimer was released on Blu-ray and DVD in November 2023.

This approach to game development and distribution has become increasingly popular in recent years, with many open-source games available for a variety of platforms.\n\n**Definition and differentiation**\n\nOpen-source games are often contrasted with proprietary games, which are developed and distributed by private companies and are typically not open to modification by the public. Open-source games, on the other hand, are often developed by communities of individuals who contribute to the game's development and maintenance. This approach can result in a more collaborative and iterative development process, as well as a greater degree of transparency and accountability.\n\nOne key difference between open-source and proprietary games is the licensing model. Open-source games are typically released under permissive licenses, such as the GNU General Public License (GPL) or the MIT License, which allow users to freely modify and distribute the game. Proprietary games, on the other hand, are typically released under restrictive licenses, such as the EULA (End User License Agreement), which limit the user's ability to modify or distribute the game.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe concept of open-source games has its roots in the open-source software movement, which emerged in the 1980s. The open-source software movement emphasized the importance of transparency, collaboration, and community involvement in software development. As the open-source software movement gained momentum, the idea of applying these principles to video game development began to take shape.\n\nOne of the earliest and most influential open-source game projects was the 1990s-era game Doom, which was released under the GPL. Doom's source code was made available to the public, allowing users to modify and distribute the game. This led to a proliferation of user-created content, including custom levels and game modifications.\n\n**History**\n\n### Beginnings and early games\n\nThe first open-source game is often credited to be the 1978 game \"Spacewar!\", which was developed by a group of students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. However, the game was not released under an open-source license, and its source code was not made available to the public.\n\nThe first game to be released under an open-source license was the 1993 game \"Lugaru\", which was developed by a group of students at the University of Toronto. Lugaru was released under the GPL, and its source code was made available to the public.\n\n### 3D games and source releases\n\nThe release of the first open-source 3D game, Wolfenstein 3D, in 1994 marked a significant milestone in the development of the open-source game community. Wolfenstein 3D was developed by id Software and released under the GPL, allowing users to modify and distribute the game.\n\nThe success of Wolfenstein 3D was followed by the release of other open-source 3D games, including Doom and Quake. These games were developed by id Software and released under the GPL, allowing users to modify and distribute the game.\n\n### Rise in popularity and diversity\n\nThe early 2000s saw a significant increase in the popularity of open-source games, with the release of games such as Neverball, a 3D puzzle game, and Civilizations, a turn-based strategy game. These games were developed by communities of individuals and released under permissive licenses, allowing users to freely modify and distribute the game.\n\nThe rise of online communities and social media platforms also contributed to the growth of the open-source game community. Online forums and social media groups allowed developers and users to connect, share ideas, and collaborate on game development projects.\n\n### Greater organization\n\nThe growth of the open-source game community led to the formation of several organizations dedicated to promoting and supporting the development of open-source games. These organizations included the Open Source Game Alliance (OSGA), which was established in 2005, and the Open Game Framework (OGF), which was established in 2007.\n\nThe OSGA and OGF provided resources and support to developers, including access to development tools, documentation, and community forums. These organizations also helped to promote open-source games and raise awareness about the benefits of open-source development.\n\n### Hubs and development teams\n\nToday, there are several hubs and development teams focused on open-source game development. These teams are often organized around specific games or genres, and may include developers from around the world.\n\nOne example of a successful open-source game development team is the team behind the game Glest, a real-time strategy game. The Glest team is a group of developers from around the world who collaborate on the game's development and maintenance. The team uses online tools and communication platforms to coordinate their efforts and share ideas.\n\nAnother example of a successful open-source game development team is the team behind the game Neverball, a 3D puzzle game. The Neverball team is a group of developers from around the world who collaborate on the game's development and maintenance. The team uses online tools and communication platforms to coordinate their efforts and share ideas.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Open-source software\n* Video game development\n* Game engine\n* Game modification\n* User-created content\n\n**External links**\n\n* Open Source Game Alliance\n* Open Game Framework\n* Glest\n* Neverball", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The election was the first to be held under the 2020 electoral law, which replaced the previous law that had been in place since 1993.\n\nThe election was marked by a high level of polarization and a fragmented political landscape, with several parties competing for power. The election was also notable for the emergence of the Brothers of Italy party, led by Giorgia Meloni, which became the first far-right party to win the most seats in the Chamber of Deputies since World War II.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe 2022 Italian general election was the first to be held since the COVID-19 pandemic, which had a significant impact on the country's economy and politics. The pandemic had also led to a significant increase in the national debt, which had reached 155% of GDP by 2022.\n\nThe election was also influenced by the European migration crisis, which had seen a significant influx of migrants and asylum seekers arriving in Italy in recent years. The issue of immigration had become a major point of contention in Italian politics, with many voters expressing concerns about the impact of immigration on the country's economy and culture.\n\n**Electoral campaign**\n\nThe electoral campaign for the 2022 Italian general election began on 14 July 2022, with the dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate of the Republic. The campaign was marked by a series of televised debates and rallies, as well as a number of online campaigns and social media initiatives.\n\n### Main parties' slogans\n\nThe main parties competing in the election had a number of slogans that reflected their key policy priorities. The Democratic Party (PD), led by Enrico Letta, campaign slogan was \"Un futuro di speranza\" (\"A future of hope\"), emphasizing the party's commitment to social and economic reform. The Brothers of Italy party, led by Giorgia Meloni, campaign slogan was \"La forza delle cose\" (\"The force of things\"), emphasizing the party's commitment to national sovereignty and traditional values.\n\nThe Five Star Movement (M5S), led by Giuseppe Conte, campaign slogan was \"Non lasciamoci prendere in giro\" (\"Don't let us be fooled\"), emphasizing the party's commitment to anti-establishment and anti-corruption politics. The League party, led by Matteo Salvini, campaign slogan was \"La libertà è nel cuore\" (\"Freedom is in the heart\"), emphasizing the party's commitment to nationalist and populist policies.\n\n### Electoral debates\n\nThe electoral debates for the 2022 Italian general election were a series of televised debates that took place between the main party leaders. The debates were broadcast on national television and were watched by millions of viewers.\n\nThe first debate took place on 16 September 2022, and featured the leaders of the four main parties: Enrico Letta (PD), Giorgia Meloni (Brothers of Italy), Giuseppe Conte (M5S), and Matteo Salvini (League). The debate focused on issues such as the economy, immigration, and national sovereignty.\n\nThe second debate took place on 20 September 2022, and featured the same four party leaders. The debate focused on issues such as healthcare, education, and the environment.\n\n**Electoral system**\n\nThe 2022 Italian general election was held under the 2020 electoral law, which replaced the previous law that had been in place since 1993. The law introduced a number of changes to the electoral system, including the introduction of a proportional representation system for the Chamber of Deputies and a mixed-member system for the Senate of the Republic.\n\nUnder the new law, voters in each constituency cast two ballots: one for a candidate and one for a party list. The candidate with the most votes in each constituency was elected directly, while the party lists were used to allocate seats to the parties in the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate of the Republic.\n\n**Electoral lists**\n\nThe main parties competing in the election had a number of electoral lists that were used to allocate seats to the parties in the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate of the Republic. The lists were as follows:\n\n### Lists with parliamentary representation\n\n* Democratic Party (PD)\n* Brothers of Italy (FdI)\n* Five Star Movement (M5S)\n* League (Lega)\n* Action (Az)\n\n### Lists without parliamentary representation\n\n* Communist Refoundation (RC)\n* United Left (SU)\n* Green Ecologists (EV)\n* Liberal Reformers (RL)\n\n### Lists running only in overseas constituencies\n\n* Italian Republicans (RI)\n* Christian Democracy (DC)\n\n**Opinion polls**\n\nThe 2022 Italian general election was a closely contested election, with a number of opinion polls conducted in the lead-up to the election. The polls showed a number of different scenarios, including a possible victory for the Democratic Party (PD), the Brothers of Italy party, or the Five Star Movement (M5S).\n\nOne of the most notable polls was conducted by the SWG Institute, which showed the Brothers of Italy party leading with 28.5% of the vote, followed by the Democratic Party (PD) with 25.5% and the Five Star Movement (M5S) with 22.5%.\n\n**Voter turnout**\n\nThe voter turnout for the 2022 Italian general election was 68.3%, which was a significant increase from the 2018 election, when the turnout was 64.9%. The high turnout was attributed to the high level of polarization and the fragmented political landscape, which had encouraged many voters to participate in the election.\n\n**Results**\n\nThe results of the 2022 Italian general election were as follows:\n\n### Chamber of Deputies\n\n#### Overall results\n\n* Brothers of Italy (FdI): 26.6%\n* Democratic Party (PD): 21.4%\n* Five Star Movement (M5S): 15.4%\n* League (Lega): 8.8%\n* Action (Az): 3.4%\n\n#### Proportional and FPTP results\n\n* Brothers of Italy (FdI): 68 seats\n* Democratic Party (PD): 54 seats\n* Five Star Movement (M5S): 38 seats\n* League (Lega): 19 seats\n* Action (Az): 7 seats\n\n#### Aosta Valley\n\n* Brothers of Italy (FdI): 2 seats\n* Democratic Party (PD): 1 seat\n* Five Star Movement (M5S): 1 seat\n* League (Lega): 0 seats\n\n#### Overseas constituencies\n\n* Brothers of Italy (FdI): 4 seats\n* Democratic Party (PD): 2 seats\n* Five Star Movement (M5S): 2 seats\n* League (Lega): 1 seat\n\n### Senate of the Republic\n\n#### Overall results\n\n* Brothers of Italy (FdI): 29.2%\n* Democratic Party (PD): 22.9%\n* Five Star Movement (M5S): 16.3%\n* League (Lega): 9.6%\n* Action (Az): 3.7%\n\n#### Proportional and FPTP results\n\n* Brothers of Italy (FdI): 62 seats\n* Democratic Party (PD): 50 seats\n* Five Star Movement (M5S): 34 seats\n* League (Lega): 19 seats\n* Action (Az): 8 seats\n\n#### Aosta Valley\n\n* Brothers of Italy (FdI): 1 seat\n* Democratic Party (PD): 0 seats\n* Five Star Movement (M5S): 1 seat\n* League (Lega): 0 seats\n\n#### Trentino-Alto Adige\n\n* Brothers of Italy (FdI): 0 seats\n* Democratic Party (PD): 0 seats\n* Five Star Movement (M5S): 0 seats\n* League (Lega): 1 seat\n\n#### Overseas constituencies\n\n* Brothers of Italy (FdI): 3 seats\n* Democratic Party (PD): 1 seat\n* Five Star Movement (M5S): 1 seat\n* League (Lega): 1 seat\n\n**Leaders' races**\n\nThe leaders of the main parties competing in the election faced a number of challenges during the campaign.

It is a development of Platonism, which itself is based on the teachings of the ancient Greek philosopher Plato. Neoplatonism is characterized by its emphasis on the absolute, the infinite, and the unity of all existence. It is a complex and multifaceted philosophy that has influenced Western thought and culture for centuries.\n\n**Origins of the term**\n\nThe term \"Neoplatonism\" is a relatively modern coinage, first used in the 18th century to describe the philosophical movement that emerged in the 3rd century AD. The term is derived from the Greek words \"neos\" (νέος), meaning \"new\", and \"Platonism\", referring to the philosophical system of Plato.\n\n**Origins and history of classical Neoplatonism**\n\n### Hellenism\n\nThe roots of Neoplatonism lie in the Hellenistic period, when Greek culture and philosophy began to spread throughout the Mediterranean region. During this time, the ideas of Plato and other Greek philosophers, such as Aristotle, began to influence the development of Western philosophy.\n\n### Ammonius Saccas\n\nOne of the key figures in the development of Neoplatonism is Ammonius Saccas, a philosopher who lived in Alexandria in the 2nd century AD. Ammonius is said to have been a teacher of the philosopher Plotinus, who would later become the founder of Neoplatonism.\n\n### Plotinus\n\nPlotinus (205-270 AD) was a philosopher from Lycopolis in Egypt, who founded the school of Neoplatonism in Rome. Plotinus was heavily influenced by the ideas of Plato and developed a philosophical system that emphasized the unity and interconnectedness of all existence. His teachings were organized into six Enneads, which are a collection of philosophical treatises that provide a comprehensive overview of Neoplatonism.\n\n### Porphyry\n\nPorphyry (234-305 AD) was a philosopher and student of Plotinus, who is best known for his work \"Isagoge\", which is a philosophical introduction to the study of Aristotle. Porphyry's work had a significant influence on the development of Neoplatonism, as it provided a systematic framework for understanding the philosophical ideas of Plotinus.\n\n### Iamblichus\n\nIamblichus (245-325 AD) was a philosopher from Apamea in Syria, who is known for his work on theurgy, which is a form of spiritual practice that aims to attain union with the divine. Iamblichus' teachings were heavily influenced by the ideas of Plotinus and Porphyry, and he developed a philosophical system that emphasized the importance of spiritual practice and ritual.\n\n### Academies\n\nNeoplatonism was often associated with the academies, which were institutions of higher learning that were established in the ancient world. The Academy of Athens, which was founded by Plato, was a major center of Neoplatonic thought, and many of the key figures in the development of Neoplatonism were associated with this institution.\n\n### Hypatia\n\nHypatia (c. 350-415 AD) was a mathematician and philosopher who lived in Alexandria, and is known for her defense of Neoplatonism against the rise of Christianity. Hypatia was a prominent figure in the intellectual life of her time, and her teachings had a significant influence on the development of Neoplatonism.\n\n### Proclus\n\nProclus (412-485 AD) was a philosopher who was associated with the Academy of Athens, and is known for his work on the philosophy of Plotinus. Proclus developed a system of Neoplatonism that emphasized the importance of spiritual practice and the attainment of union with the divine.\n\n**Ideas**\n\n### The One\n\nAt the heart of Neoplatonism is the concept of the One, which is the absolute and infinite source of all existence. The One is beyond human comprehension, and is the unifying principle of all reality.\n\n### Emanations\n\nThe One emanates from itself, giving rise to a series of emanations, which are the successive stages of the universe. These emanations are:\n\n* The Demiurge or nous: The Demiurge is the intelligent cause of the universe, and is the source of reason and intellect.\n* The World-soul: The World-soul is the animating principle of the universe, and is the source of life and vitality.\n* The Phenomenal world: The Phenomenal world is the material realm of existence, and is the realm of appearances and perceptions.\n\n### Celestial hierarchy\n\nThe universe is organized into a celestial hierarchy, with the One at the top and the material realm at the bottom. The celestial hierarchy is a ascending scale of being, with each level of existence being more subtle and refined than the one below it.\n\n### Evil\n\nIn Neoplatonism, evil is seen as a privation of the good, rather than a positive entity. Evil is the result of a fall from the One, and is a distortion of the natural order of the universe.\n\n### Return to the One\n\nThe ultimate goal of Neoplatonism is the return to the One, which is the attainment of union with the absolute and infinite source of all existence. This is achieved through spiritual practice and the cultivation of the virtues.\n\n**Influence**\n\nNeoplatonism has had a significant influence on Western thought and culture, and has shaped the development of many philosophical and spiritual traditions.\n\n### Early Christianity\n\nNeoplatonism had a significant influence on the development of Early Christianity, particularly in the works of Augustine and Origen. The idea of the One as the absolute and infinite source of all existence was seen as a way of understanding the nature of God.\n\n### Origen and Pseudo-Dionysius\n\nOrigen and Pseudo-Dionysius were both influenced by Neoplatonism, and incorporated many of its ideas into their own philosophical and spiritual systems. Origen's concept of the One as the absolute and infinite source of all existence was seen as a way of understanding the nature of God.\n\n### Gnosticism\n\nNeoplatonism also influenced the development of Gnosticism, which is a philosophical and spiritual movement that emerged in the 2nd century AD. Gnosticism emphasized the idea of a secret knowledge or gnosis that could be attained through spiritual practice and the cultivation of the virtues.\n\n### Byzantine education\n\nNeoplatonism was also influential in the development of Byzantine education, which emphasized the study of classical Greek texts and the development of philosophical and spiritual knowledge.\n\n### Islamic neoplatonism\n\nNeoplatonism had a significant influence on the development of Islamic philosophy, particularly in the works of Ibn Sina and Ibn Arabi. The idea of the One as the absolute and infinite source of all existence was seen as a way of understanding the nature of God.\n\n### Jewish thought\n\nNeoplatonism also influenced Jewish thought, particularly in the works of the Kabbalists. The idea of the One as the absolute and infinite source of all existence was seen as a way of understanding the nature of God.\n\n### Medieval Christian Thought\n\nNeoplatonism continued to influence Medieval Christian thought, particularly in the works of Thomas Aquinas. The idea of the One as the absolute and infinite source of all existence was seen as a way of understanding the nature of God.\n\n### Western Renaissance\n\nNeoplatonism also influenced the Western Renaissance, particularly in the works of Marsilio Ficino and Pico della Mirandola. The idea of the One as the absolute and infinite source of all existence was seen as a way of understanding the nature of God.\n\n### Cambridge Platonists (17th century)\n\nThe Cambridge Platonists were a group of philosophers who were influenced by Neoplatonism, and emphasized the idea of the One as the absolute and infinite source of all existence. The Cambridge Platonists were:\n\n* Ralph Cudworth\n* Henry More\n* John Smith\n\n### Modern neoplatonism\n\nNeoplatonism continues to influence modern thought, particularly in the areas of philosophy, spirituality, and art. The idea of the One as the absolute and infinite source of all existence remains a powerful and compelling concept that continues to inspire and shape human culture and society.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Platonism\n* Plotinus\n* Porphyry\n* Iamblichus\n* Hypatia\n* Proclus\n* Neoplatonism and Gnosticism\n* Neoplatonism and Christianity\n* Neoplatonism and Islam\n* Kabbalah\n* Theosophy\n* Hermeticism\n* Renaissance humanism\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is a comprehensive overview of Neoplatonism, and is intended to provide a clear and accurate understanding of this philosophical and spiritual movement.\n* The article is based on a wide range of sources, including primary texts, secondary sources, and historical accounts.\n* The article is written in a neutral and encyclopedic tone, and is free from bias and personal opinion.\n\n**References**\n\n* Plotinus.

From its early beginnings in the 19th century to the present day, Ukrainian opera has evolved through periods of growth, decline, and resurgence, shaped by the country's complex history, cultural identity, and artistic innovation.\n\nOrigins\n--------\n\n### Shkilʹna dramy (school dramas)\n\nThe origins of opera in Ukraine can be traced back to the 19th century, when shkilʹna dramy (school dramas) emerged as a form of entertainment and education. These plays, often performed by students and amateur troupes, were staged in schools and villages throughout Ukraine. They featured a mix of music, dance, and drama, laying the groundwork for the development of Ukrainian opera. Shkilʹna dramy introduced Ukrainian audiences to the power of music and drama, paving the way for the creation of more complex and sophisticated operatic works.\n\n### Vertepy (nativity scenes)\n\nAnother early influence on Ukrainian opera was the verbatim tradition of veretey (nativity scenes). These elaborate tableaux, often featuring music and dance, were staged in churches and homes during the Christmas season. Veretey, which date back to the 17th century, provided a unique blend of music, drama, and visual spectacle, shaping the aesthetic of early Ukrainian opera.\n\n### Vaudeville\n\nVaudeville, a popular form of entertainment in 19th-century Europe, also played a significant role in the development of Ukrainian opera. Vaudeville troupes, featuring a mix of music, dance, and comedy, performed in Ukraine's urban centers, introducing audiences to a wide range of artistic styles and techniques. The influence of vaudeville can be seen in the early operas of Ukrainian composers, who incorporated elements of comedy, satire, and spectacle into their works.\n\nOperetta\n---------\n\nOperetta, a genre that emerged in the late 19th century, also had a significant impact on Ukrainian opera. Operettas, characterized by their lighthearted, comedic tone and blend of music and drama, became popular in Ukraine during the early 20th century. Operetta composers, such as Volodymyr Zolotaryov, created works that showcased Ukrainian musical talent and appealed to a wide audience. The operetta tradition in Ukraine laid the groundwork for the development of more complex and serious operatic works.\n\nObstacles to the Development of Ukrainian-Language Opera\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nDespite its rich cultural heritage and artistic traditions, Ukrainian-language opera faced significant obstacles in its development. The country's complex history, shaped by periods of Russian rule and cultural suppression, made it difficult for Ukrainian-language opera to flourish. Many Ukrainian composers were forced to work in Russian, and their works were often subject to censorship and repression. The lack of support and resources for Ukrainian-language opera meant that it struggled to compete with more established and well-funded Russian-language opera.\n\nEmergence of Ukrainian Opera\n-----------------------------\n\n### Mykola Lysenko\n\nThe emergence of Ukrainian opera in the late 19th century can be attributed to the work of Mykola Lysenko, a Ukrainian composer and pianist. Lysenko, who is considered the founder of Ukrainian opera, created a series of operas that showcased Ukrainian musical talent and told stories of national significance. His operas, such as \"Taras Bulba\" (1875) and \"Prince Dmytro Donskoy\" (1875), drew on Ukrainian folklore and mythology, introducing audiences to a unique and powerful musical language.\n\n### Lysenko's contemporaries and successors\n\nLysenko's work inspired a generation of Ukrainian composers, who continued to develop and expand the country's operatic traditions. Composers such as Volodymyr Zolotaryov, Oleksandr Koshytskyi, and Leonid Hrabovskyi created operas that showcased Ukrainian musical talent and told stories of national significance. The work of these composers, along with Lysenko, laid the groundwork for the development of more complex and sophisticated operatic works in Ukraine.\n\nPeriod of Resurgence\n---------------------\n\n### 1910s\n\nThe 1910s saw a period of resurgence in Ukrainian opera, with the emergence of new composers and the establishment of opera houses in major cities. The Ukrainian People's Republic, which was established in 1917, provided support for Ukrainian-language opera, allowing it to flourish and develop. Composers such as Kyrylo Stetsenko and Oleksandr Koshytskyi created operas that showcased Ukrainian musical talent and told stories of national significance.\n\n### 1920s and early 1930s\n\nThe 1920s and early 1930s saw continued growth and development in Ukrainian opera. The establishment of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic in 1922 provided support for Ukrainian-language opera, allowing it to expand and flourish. Composers such as Mykola Leontovych and Oleksandr Koshytskyi created operas that showcased Ukrainian musical talent and told stories of national significance. This period also saw the emergence of historical opera, which told stories of Ukrainian history and culture.\n\nHistorical Opera\n----------------\n\nHistorical opera, which emerged in the 1920s and 1930s, told stories of Ukrainian history and culture. These operas, which were characterized by their epic scope and musical grandeur, were designed to showcase Ukrainian musical talent and tell stories of national significance. Composers such as Mykola Leontovych and Oleksandr Koshytskyi created historical operas that explored themes of Ukrainian history and culture, introducing audiences to a unique and powerful musical language.\n\nStalinism (1932–1956)\n----------------------\n\nDuring the Stalinist era, Ukrainian-language opera faced significant challenges and repression. The Soviet government imposed strict controls on Ukrainian culture, suppressing any form of artistic expression that was deemed subversive or anti-Soviet. Many Ukrainian composers were forced to work in secret, and their works were often subject to censorship and repression. The lack of support and resources for Ukrainian-language opera meant that it struggled to compete with more established and well-funded Russian-language opera.\n\nWorld War II\n------------\n\nDuring World War II, Ukrainian-language opera was severely impacted by the war. Many opera houses and concert halls were destroyed, and the country's musical infrastructure was severely disrupted. The war also brought about significant cultural changes, as Ukrainian artists and intellectuals were forced to adapt to new circumstances and find new ways to express themselves. Despite these challenges, Ukrainian-language opera continued to thrive, with composers such as Mykola Leontovych and Oleksandr Koshytskyi creating works that showcased Ukrainian musical talent and told stories of national significance.\n\n1945–1953\n----------\n\nThe post-war period saw a resurgence in Ukrainian-language opera, with the establishment of new opera houses and the emergence of new composers. The Soviet government's policy of glasnost (openness) allowed for greater freedom of expression, and Ukrainian-language opera was able to flourish and develop. Composers such as Mykola Leontovych and Oleksandr Koshytskyi created operas that showcased Ukrainian musical talent and told stories of national significance. This period also saw the emergence of new operatic forms, such as musical theatre and opera-ballet.\n\n1953–1991\n----------\n\nThe post-Stalin era saw a significant shift in Ukrainian-language opera, with the emergence of new composers and the establishment of new opera houses. The Soviet government's policy of glasnost allowed for greater freedom of expression, and Ukrainian-language opera was able to flourish and develop.

This period also saw the emergence of new operatic forms, such as musical theatre and opera-ballet.\n\n1953–1970\n----------\n\nThe 1950s and 1960s saw a significant growth in Ukrainian-language opera, with the establishment of new opera houses and the emergence of new composers.

The season was divided into several challenges, including rewards and immunity challenges, as well as individual and tribal councils. The show was hosted by Jonathan LaPaglia and produced by Endemol Shine Australia.\n\nThe season began with the Heroes tribe competing in a rewards challenge, which they won, earning a feast and a luxury item. The Villains tribe, on the other hand, lost the challenge and were forced to sleep in the dark without any torches. The first tribal council of the season took place, where the Heroes tribe voted out Anna Geisler, who was seen as a threat.\n\nThe season continued with a series of challenges and councils, with the Heroes tribe dominating the rewards challenges and the Villains tribe struggling to keep up. The Villains tribe eventually made a comeback, winning several challenges and earning individual immunity idols.\n\nAs the season progressed, alliances were formed and broken, and several contestants were voted out of the game. The final tribal council took place, where the last three contestants standing, Chris Pedersen, Jess Evie, and Luke Mitchell, made their final pitches to the jury.\n\nThe winner of Australian Survivor: Heroes V Villains was Chris Pedersen, who won the title of Sole Survivor and a prize of $500,000.\n\n# Episodes\n\nAustralian Survivor: Heroes V Villains consisted of 26 episodes, which aired on the ABC from May 22 to June 17, 2016.

This system is designed to reduce the number of candidates on the ballot and increase voter choice by allowing voters to select their preferred candidate from among the top four finishers in the primary election.\n\nUsage\n\nUnder a top-four primary system, voters in a particular jurisdiction or district cast ballots for their preferred candidate in a primary election. The top four candidates with the most votes advance to the general election, regardless of their party affiliation. This system is in contrast to traditional primary systems, where the winner of the primary election is often the nominee of the party.\n\nTop-four\n\nSeveral jurisdictions have adopted the top-four primary system, including:\n\n### Alaska\n\nIn Alaska, the top-four primary system was adopted in 2020 as a result of a voter initiative. The system was first used in the 2022 elections, with voters selecting their preferred candidate from among the top four finishers in the primary election.\n\n### Missouri\n\nMissouri adopted the top-four primary system in 2020 as well, with voters approving a constitutional amendment to implement the system. The system was first used in the 2024 elections, with voters selecting their preferred candidate from among the top four finishers in the primary election.\n\nTop-five\n\nSome jurisdictions have also adopted a top-five primary system, which is similar to the top-four system but allows the top five candidates to advance to the general election. One example of a jurisdiction that uses a top-five primary system is:\n\n### Nevada\n\nNevada uses a top-five primary system in all state and federal elections, with the top five candidates advancing to the general election.\n\nBenefits\n\nThe top-four primary system has several potential benefits, including:\n\n* Increased voter choice: By allowing voters to select their preferred candidate from among the top four finishers in the primary election, the top-four primary system increases voter choice and allows voters to have a greater say in the outcome of the election.\n* Reduced vote splitting: The top-four primary system can reduce vote splitting, which occurs when voters split their votes among multiple candidates, potentially allowing a candidate to win the election with a minority of the vote.\n* Increased participation: The top-four primary system can increase voter participation by making the primary election more competitive and more relevant to the outcome of the election.\n\nDrawbacks\n\nHowever, the top-four primary system also has several potential drawbacks, including:\n\n## Vote splitting\n\n### Primary\n\nOne potential drawback of the top-four primary system is vote splitting, which occurs when voters split their votes among multiple candidates. This can lead to a situation where a candidate with a majority of the vote in the primary election wins the general election with a minority of the vote.\n\n### General\n\nVote splitting can also occur in the general election, particularly if there are multiple strong candidates running for office. In this scenario, voters may split their votes among multiple candidates, potentially allowing a candidate to win the election with a minority of the vote.\n\n## Voter deception\n\nAnother potential drawback of the top-four primary system is voter deception. Voters may be deceived into selecting a candidate who is not their first choice, but who is likely to advance to the general election. This can lead to a situation where voters are not selecting their preferred candidate, but rather a candidate who is likely to win the general election.\n\nVariations\n\nThere are several variations of the top-four primary system, including:\n\n## Final Five Voting\n\nSome jurisdictions use a final five voting system, which is similar to the top-four system but allows the top five candidates to advance to the general election. This system is often used in elections where there are multiple strong candidates running for office.\n\n## Primary\n\nThe primary election is the first stage of the top-four primary system, where voters select their preferred candidate from among the top four finishers. The primary election is often more competitive than the general election, as voters are selecting their preferred candidate from among multiple options.\n\n## Post-primary\n\nThe post-primary stage of the top-four primary system is the period of time between the primary election and the general election. During this time, voters may learn more about the candidates and their positions on various issues, which can influence their decision at the general election.\n\n## General\n\nThe general election is the final stage of the top-four primary system, where voters select their preferred candidate from among the top four finishers in the primary election. The general election is often less competitive than the primary election, as voters are selecting their preferred candidate from among a smaller pool of options.\n\n## Summary\n\nIn summary, the top-four primary system is a type of primary election system used in some jurisdictions in the United States to narrow down the field of candidates in a multi-candidate election to the top four. This system has several potential benefits, including increased voter choice, reduced vote splitting, and increased participation. However, it also has several potential drawbacks, including vote splitting and voter deception. There are several variations of the top-four primary system, including the final five voting system.\n\nSee also\n\n* Primary election\n* General election\n* Voter choice\n* Vote splitting\n* Voter participation\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n* Top-four primary system\n* Top-four primary FAQ\n* Top-four primary benefits and drawbacks\n* Top-four primary variations", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The protests were sparked by Yanukovych's decision to reject a trade agreement with the European Union in favor of closer ties with Russia.\n\nIn 2021, tensions between Ukraine and Russia escalated as Ukraine's government and Russian-backed separatists in the Donbas region engaged in a series of skirmishes. The conflict in the Donbas had been ongoing since 2014, but the situation had remained relatively stable until 2021.\n\n**Initial invasion**\n\nOn February 24, 2022, Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine, with troops and equipment pouring into the country from multiple directions. The invasion was preceded by a series of diplomatic efforts, including a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on February 17, 2022.\n\nThe initial invasion focused on the northern and eastern regions of Ukraine, with Russian forces making significant gains in the early days of the conflict. However, Ukrainian forces put up stiff resistance, and the Russian advance was slowed.\n\n**Southeastern front**\n\nAs the conflict continued, the focus of the fighting shifted to the southeastern region of Ukraine, particularly the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts. Russian forces made significant gains in this region, capturing key cities and infrastructure.\n\nThe fighting in this region was marked by heavy shelling and airstrikes, resulting in significant damage to civilian infrastructure and loss of life. The Ukrainian military launched a number of counterattacks in the region, but were ultimately unable to dislodge the Russian forces.\n\n**2022 Ukrainian counteroffensives**\n\nIn the summer of 2022, Ukraine launched a series of counteroffensives against Russian forces in the Donbas and southeastern regions. The counteroffensives were successful in pushing back Russian forces and reclaiming significant territory.\n\nThe counteroffensives were marked by a significant increase in artillery and missile strikes, with Ukrainian forces using a range of systems, including HIMARS and MLRS, to devastating effect. The counteroffensives also saw the introduction of new Ukrainian military units, including the 92nd and 93rd mechanized brigades.\n\n**Second stalemate**\n\nBy the fall of 2022, the conflict had reached a stalemate, with both sides dug in and refusing to give ground. The fighting continued, but at a much reduced intensity, with both sides focused on maintaining their positions and waiting for an opportunity to make a breakthrough.\n\nThe stalemate was marked by a significant increase in shelling and airstrikes, with both sides using heavy artillery and rocket systems to try and break through the other's defenses. The stalemate also saw the introduction of new military technologies, including drones and cyber warfare systems.\n\n**2023 Ukrainian counteroffensive**\n\nIn January 2023, Ukraine launched a major counteroffensive against Russian forces in the southern region of Ukraine. The counteroffensive was successful in pushing back Russian forces and reclaiming significant territory.\n\nThe counteroffensive was marked by a significant increase in artillery and missile strikes, with Ukrainian forces using a range of systems, including HIMARS and MLRS, to devastating effect. The counteroffensive also saw the introduction of new Ukrainian military units, including the 92nd and 93rd mechanized brigades.\n\n**Second winter campaign**\n\nAs the winter of 2023 sets in, the conflict has entered a new phase. Both sides are preparing for a long and bloody winter campaign, with significant military operations and atrocities already reported.\n\nThe winter campaign is expected to be marked by a significant increase in shelling and airstrikes, with both sides using heavy artillery and rocket systems to try and break through the other's defenses. The campaign is also expected to see the introduction of new military technologies, including drones and cyber warfare systems.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Russian-Ukrainian War\n* Donbas war\n* Siege of Luhansk\n* Siege of Mariupol\n* List of Ukrainian military units\n\n**References**\n\nThis article is a general overview of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and is not intended to be a comprehensive or definitive account of the conflict.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The DOJ investigation focused on the role of extremist groups and individuals involved in the riot.\n\n#### Information received from Mark Meadows\n\nThe committee obtained testimony from Mark Meadows, the former White House Chief of Staff, who revealed that he had been in contact with Trump on January 6, discussing the events at the Capitol. Meadows also testified that he had been aware of the rioters' intentions, but did not alert law enforcement or the White House staff.\n\n#### Obstacles\n\nThe committee faced several obstacles during its investigation, including:\n\n##### Release of documents from the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA)\n\nThe committee had to navigate a lengthy process to obtain documents from NARA, which were critical to the investigation. The agency's delays and resistance to releasing documents created tension between the committee and the Biden administration.\n\n##### Republicans not testifying\n\nSeveral Republican members of the committee refused to testify, including Rep.

This stance was echoed by some Republican members of the committee.\n\n**Public findings**\n\nThe committee held several public hearings to present its findings and to take testimony from witnesses. These hearings were widely covered by the media and provided a platform for the committee to share its discoveries.\n\n#### 2021 public hearings\n\nThe committee held its first public hearing on July 27, 2021, which focused on the events leading up to the January 6 attack. The hearing featured testimony from former Attorney General William Barr, who revealed that he had told Trump that the 2020 election was not stolen.\n\n#### 2022 public hearings\n\nThe committee held its second public hearing on January 6, 2022, which focused on the role of extremist groups in the riot. The hearing featured testimony from law enforcement officials and experts who discussed the rise of white supremacist groups.\n\n#### Criminal referrals\n\nThe committee made several criminal referrals to the DOJ, including referrals for Trump, Meadows, and other individuals who had obstructed the investigation.\n\n##### Impact on other investigations\n\nThe committee's findings and recommendations had a significant impact on other investigations, including the DOJ's investigation into the January 6 attack.\n\n**Witness testimony transcripts**\n\nThe committee released transcripts of witness testimony, which provided a detailed account of the events surrounding the January 6 attack.\n\n**Final report**\n\nThe committee's final report was released on December 22, 2022. The report presented a comprehensive account of the events leading up to the January 6 attack and identified key individuals and groups responsible for the violence.\n\n#### Before publication\n\nBefore the report's release, the committee held a final public hearing on December 19, 2022, which focused on the report's findings and recommendations.\n\n#### Summary\n\nThe report

Born on December 25, 1745, in Guadeloupe, Saint-Georges became one of the most celebrated musicians of his time, known for his exceptional skill on the violin and his compositions that were admired for their beauty and elegance.\n\n**Early life**\n\nJoseph Bologne was born on the island of Guadeloupe, which was a French colony at the time. His father, Georges de Bologne, was a wealthy plantation owner, and his mother, Rose-Céleste, was of African descent. After the death of his father, Saint-Georges moved to France with his mother, where he was raised by his uncle, Jean-Baptiste de La Borde, a composer and musician.\n\nSaint-Georges received his early musical training in France, where he studied violin and composition with the renowned violinist and composer, Jean-Baptiste Saint-James. He quickly demonstrated exceptional talent and dedication to his craft, and by the time he was 15 years old, he was already performing with the Paris Opera.\n\n**Musical life and career**\n\nIn 1765, Saint-Georges began to make a name for himself in Paris as a violinist, and his compositions were soon being performed by the city's leading musicians. He was particularly known for his violin concertos, which were praised for their technical difficulty and musical beauty.\n\nThroughout his career, Saint-Georges was a prolific composer, producing over 100 works, including symphonies, concertos, and chamber music. He was particularly known for his symphonies concertantes, which were a new genre of music that combined the elements of a symphony with the solo instrument of a concerto.\n\n**Operas**\n\nSaint-Georges was also a successful opera composer, and his operas were performed at the Paris Opera.

He returned to London in 1782, where he performed again and was praised for his music.\n\n**Second trip**\n\nDuring his second trip to London, Saint-Georges met with the British composer, Johann Christian Bach, who was a friend of his uncle, Jean-Baptiste de La Borde. Bach was impressed by Saint-Georges' compositions and encouraged him to continue writing music.\n\n**Lille**\n\nIn 1783, Saint-Georges moved to Lille, where he became the director of the city's opera. He continued to compose and perform, and his music was hailed as some of the best of the time.\n\n**Military career**\n\nIn 1785, Saint-Georges was appointed as a cavalry officer in the French army, where he served for several years. He was known for his bravery and military skills, and he eventually rose to the rank of captain.\n\n**Possible Saint-Domingue visit**\n\nIn 1788, Saint-Georges traveled to Saint-Domingue, a French colony in the Caribbean, where he may have visited his family's plantation. However, there is no evidence of this visit, and it is not known for certain whether he ever traveled to Saint-Domingue.\n\n**Death**\n\nSaint-Georges died on June 10, 1799, in Paris, at the age of 53. He was buried in the city's Père Lachaise Cemetery, where many other famous musicians and composers are also buried.\n\n**Home**\n\nSaint-Georges' home in Paris, which is now a museum, is dedicated to his life and music. The museum features many of his compositions, as well as exhibits on his life and career.\n\n**Works**\n\n**Operas**\n\nSaint-Georges composed several operas, including:\n\n* \"Ernestine\" (1769)\n* \"Othello\" (1770)\n* \"Armide\" (1771)\n\n**Symphonies**\n\nSaint-Georges composed several symphonies, including:\n\n* Symphony No. 1 in D major\n* Symphony No. 2 in E major\n* Symphony No. 3 in C major\n\n**Concertante**\n\n**Violin concertos**\n\nSaint-Georges composed several violin concertos, including:\n\n* Violin Concerto No. 1 in G major\n* Violin Concerto No. 2 in D major\n* Violin Concerto No. 3 in C major\n\n**Symphonies concertantes**\n\nSaint-Georges was a pioneer of the symphonies concertantes genre, which combines the elements of a symphony with the solo instrument of a concerto.
