The effects of climate change are far-reaching and have significant impacts on various aspects of the environment, human health, and the economy. This article provides an overview of the effects of climate change, including changes in temperature, weather patterns, land, oceans, ice and snow, wildlife and nature, tipping points, human settlements, and economic impacts.\n\n**Changes in Temperature**\n\nRising temperatures are one of the most noticeable effects of climate change. The average global temperature has risen by about 1°C since the late 19th century, and the 20 warmest years on record have all occurred since 1981. The warming trend is not uniform across the globe, with some regions experiencing more pronounced temperature increases than others.\n\n**Weather**\n\nChanges in weather patterns are another significant effect of climate change. Weather is influenced by various factors, including temperature, atmospheric pressure, and wind patterns. Climate change is altering these patterns, leading to more extreme weather events.\n\n### **Heat Waves and Temperature Extremes**\n\nHeat waves are prolonged periods of abnormally hot weather, which can be deadly, especially for vulnerable populations such as the elderly and young children. Temperature extremes are also becoming more common, with temperatures rising above 40°C (104°F) in many parts of the world.\n\n### **Rain**\n\nChanges in precipitation patterns are also occurring, with some regions experiencing more frequent and intense rainfall events, while others are experiencing droughts. Heavy rainfall events are becoming more common, leading to flooding and landslides.\n\n### **Extreme Storms**\n\nExtreme storms, including hurricanes, typhoons, and cyclones, are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change. These storms can cause catastrophic damage to infrastructure and loss of life.\n\n**Land**\n\nChanges in land use and land cover are also being affected by climate change. Rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns are altering soil quality, leading to reduced agricultural productivity and increased risk of landslides.\n\n### **Floods**\n\nFloods are becoming more common due to climate change, particularly in low-lying areas and coastal regions. Heavy rainfall and storm surges are causing widespread flooding, which can be deadly and destructive.\n\n### **Droughts**\n\nDroughts are also becoming more common, particularly in regions with limited water resources. Droughts can have devastating impacts on agriculture, forestry, and ecosystems.\n\n### **Wildfires**\n\nWildfires are becoming more common and intense due to climate change. Rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns are creating conditions that are conducive to wildfires, which can cause significant damage to ecosystems and infrastructure.\n\n**Oceans**\n\nChanges in ocean chemistry and temperature are also occurring due to climate change. The oceans are absorbing a significant portion of the carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere, leading to ocean acidification and warming.\n\n### **Sea Level Rise**\n\nSea level rise is one of the most significant effects of climate change. Melting of glaciers and ice sheets, as well as the thermal expansion of seawater, are contributing to sea level rise, which can lead to coastal flooding and erosion.\n\n**Ice and Snow**\n\nChanges in ice and snow cover are also occurring due to climate change. Glaciers and ice sheets are melting at an alarming rate, which can have significant impacts on sea level rise and ocean chemistry.\n\n### **Glaciers Decline**\n\nGlaciers are declining at an alarming rate due to climate change. This can have significant impacts on sea level rise and ocean chemistry.\n\n### **Ice Sheets Decline**\n\nIce sheets are also declining due to climate change. The Antarctic ice sheet is showing signs of collapse, which can have catastrophic impacts on sea level rise.\n\n### **Sea Ice Decline**\n\nSea ice is declining due to climate change, particularly in the Arctic region. This can have significant impacts on ocean chemistry and marine ecosystems.\n\n### **Permafrost Thawing**\n\nPermafrost is thawing due to climate change, particularly in the Arctic region. This can have significant impacts on ecosystems and the release of greenhouse gases.\n\n**Wildlife and Nature**\n\nChanges in wildlife and ecosystems are also occurring due to climate change. Rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns are altering the distribution and abundance of plant and animal species.\n\n### **Ecosystems on Land**\n\nEcosystems on land are being affected by climate change, particularly in regions with limited water resources. Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns are altering the distribution and abundance of plant and animal species.\n\n### **Marine Ecosystems**\n\nMarine ecosystems are also being affected by climate change, particularly in regions with high levels of ocean acidification and warming. Changes in sea temperature and chemistry are altering the distribution and abundance of marine species.\n\n**Tipping Points and Irreversible Impacts**\n\nClimate change is pushing ecosystems towards tipping points, which can have irreversible impacts. These tipping points include the collapse of ice sheets, the degradation of coral reefs, and the loss of biodiversity.\n\n**Health, Food Security, and Water Security**\n\nClimate change is also having significant impacts on human health, food security, and water security.\n\n### **Health**\n\nClimate change is increasing the risk of heat-related illnesses, respiratory problems, and the spread of diseases. Heat waves and extreme weather events are also causing mental health problems.\n\n### **Food Security**\n\nClimate change is altering the distribution and abundance of crops, which can lead to food insecurity and malnutrition. Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns are also affecting agricultural productivity.\n\n### **Water Security**\n\nClimate change is affecting the availability and quality of water resources, particularly in regions with limited water resources. Changes in precipitation patterns and increased evaporation are altering the distribution and abundance of water.\n\n**Human Settlements**\n\nClimate change is also having significant impacts on human settlements, particularly in low-lying areas and coastal regions.\n\n### **Impacts from Heat**\n\nHeat waves are becoming more common, particularly in urban areas, which can lead to heat-related illnesses and mortality.\n\n### **Low-Lying Coastal Regions**\n\nLow-lying coastal regions are being affected by sea level rise, which can lead to coastal flooding, erosion, and displacement.\n\n**Impacts on Societies**\n\nClimate change is also having significant impacts on societies, particularly in regions with high levels of vulnerability.\n\n### **Displacement and Migration**\n\nClimate change is causing displacement and migration, particularly in regions with high levels of sea level rise, drought, and extreme weather events.\n\n### **Conflict**\n\nClimate change is increasing the risk of conflict, particularly in regions with limited resources and high levels of vulnerability.\n\n### **Social Impacts on Vulnerable Groups**\n\nClimate change is having significant social impacts on vulnerable groups, particularly women, children, and the elderly.\n\n### **Possibility of Societal Collapse**\n\nClimate change is also increasing the possibility of societal collapse, particularly in regions with high levels of vulnerability and limited resources.\n\n**Economic Impacts**\n\nClimate change is also having significant economic impacts, particularly in regions with high levels of vulnerability.\n\n### **Economic Inequality**\n\nClimate change is exacerbating economic inequality, particularly in regions with limited resources and high levels of vulnerability.\n\n### **Highly Affected Sectors**\n\nClimate change is affecting various sectors, including agriculture, forestry, energy, and tourism.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Climate change mitigation\n* Climate change adaptation\n* Renewable energy\n* Sustainable development\n* Global warming\n\n**References**\n\n* Sources:\n\t+ IPCC (2013).

The film is the 12th film in Branagh's Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot series.\n\nPlot\n--------\n\nThe story takes place in Venice, Italy, in the 1930s. Hercule Poirot, a renowned Belgian detective, is invited to a book launch party by his friend, writer and critic, Karlilis. Karlilis has organized a weekend retreat for a group of writers, intellectuals, and artists at a luxurious villa on the outskirts of Venice. However, the atmosphere becomes tense when a mysterious and sinister presence begins to haunt the group, leading to a series of tragic events.\n\nThe story revolves around Poirot's investigation into the mysterious occurrences, which eventually lead him to uncover a dark secret that has been hidden for years. Along the way, he must navigate the complex web of relationships and alliances between the characters, each with their own secrets and motivations.\n\nCast\n-----\n\n* Kenneth Branagh as Hercule Poirot\n* Tina Fey as Ariadne Oliver\n* Annette Bening as Lady Tressel\n* Josh O'Connor as Karlilis\n* Kelly Reilly as Frances Carlton\n* Michelle Pfeiffer as Mary Debenham\n* Riccardo Scamarcio as Giacomo Vittori\n\nProduction\n------------\n\n### Development\n\nThe idea for A Haunting in Venice was conceived by Kenneth Branagh, who had previously adapted several Agatha Christie novels for film and stage.

The screenplay was written in collaboration with Branagh, who also directed the film.\n\n### Filming\n\nPrincipal photography for A Haunting in Venice began in October 2021 and lasted for several months, with filming taking place in various locations in the UK and Italy.\n\nThe film's production design was led by Jim Clay, who worked closely with Branagh to create a visually stunning and atmospheric setting for the story.

In Italy, filming took place in the city of Venice and the surrounding countryside.\n\nThe film's main set was a luxurious villa on the outskirts of Venice, which was designed to resemble a 1930s-era Italian palazzo. The villa featured a range of ornate and atmospheric settings, including grand halls, opulent bedrooms, and a beautifully decorated library.\n\n### Music\n\nThe film's score was composed by Patrick Doyle, who worked closely with Branagh to create a range of subtle and atmospheric themes that reflected the film's complex and nuanced tone.\n\nThe film's soundtrack also features a range of period-specific jazz and classical music, which helps to create a sense of atmosphere and mood.\n\nRelease\n-------\n\nA Haunting in Venice was released in the United States on October 7, 2022, and in the United Kingdom on October 14, 2022.\n\nThe film received a wide release in both the US and the UK, with screenings taking place in over 1,500 cinemas in the US and over 500 cinemas in the UK.\n\nReception\n----------\n\n### Box office\n\nA Haunting in Venice received a mixed response from audiences and critics, with some praising the film's atmospheric and visually stunning setting, while others found the story to be overly complex and slow-paced.\n\nThe film's box office performance was also mixed, with some markets performing well and others underperforming.

Others praised the film's production design and cinematography, which helped to create a sense of atmosphere and mood.\n\nHowever, others found the film to be overly long and slow-paced, with some critics suggesting that the story could have been told more efficiently.\n\n### Accolades\n\nA Haunting in Venice received a range of accolades, including several nominations for the film's production design, cinematography, and costumes.\n\nThe film also received several nominations for its cast, including Michelle Pfeiffer, Annette Bening, and Josh O'Connor.\n\nFuture\n------\n\nA Haunting in Venice marked the 12th film in Kenneth Branagh's Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot series, and the final film in the series was released in 2023.\n\nThe film's success was followed by a range of spin-offs and adaptations, including a stage play and a television series.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nExternal links\n---------------", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The scheme was announced by the Ministry of Defence as a part of the \"Manoj Sinha Committee Report\" aimed at enhancing the operational efficiency and reducing the strength of the armed forces.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Indian Armed Forces have been facing a shortage of personnel due to various factors such as low recruitment rates, high attrition rates, and an aging workforce. The Ministry of Defence conducted a comprehensive review of the existing military recruitment system and recommended the introduction of a short-term service program to address these issues. The Agnipath Scheme was designed to provide a platform for young individuals to serve in the armed forces, gain experience, and acquire skills, while also reducing the financial burden on the exchequer.\n\n**Overview**\n\nThe Agnipath Scheme offers a four-year short-term service program for youth between the ages of 17.5 and 23 years. The candidates will be inducted into the Indian Armed Forces as Agniveers and will undergo a four-year training period. During this period, they will receive a basic pay of ₹30,000 per month and other allowances, totaling ₹4.76 lakh per year. After completing their four-year term, the Agniveers will be eligible for a one-time \"Seva Nidhi\" package of ₹11.71 lakh, which includes a lump sum payment and a corpus of ₹10 lakh. The scheme also provides for a 10% reservation for women and 50% reservation for other backward classes (OBCs) and 20% for economically weaker sections (EWS).\n\n**Reservation and Welfare Benefits**\n\nThe Agnipath Scheme offers a range of benefits and reservations to ensure that the scheme is inclusive and equitable. The scheme provides a 10% reservation for women, which is one of the highest reservations for women in any military recruitment program in the country. Additionally, the scheme provides a 50% reservation for OBCs and 20% for EWS, which is aimed at promoting social equity and inclusion. The scheme also provides for a range of welfare benefits, including medical facilities, leave and holidays, and other benefits.\n\n**Criticism**\n\nThe Agnipath Scheme has faced criticism from various quarters, including political parties, activists, retired defence personnel, and state governments.\n\n**By Political Parties and Activists**\n\nSeveral opposition parties, including the Congress and the Communist Party of India (Marxist), have criticized the Agnipath Scheme, terming it as a \"short-sighted\" and \"reckless\" decision. Activists have also criticized the scheme, arguing that it will lead to a shortage of personnel in the armed forces and compromise national security.\n\n**By Retired Defence Personnel**\n\nRetired defence personnel have also criticized the Agnipath Scheme, arguing that it will lead to a lack of experience and expertise in the armed forces. They have also argued that the scheme is a \"cost-cutting\" measure that will compromise the quality of the armed forces.\n\n**By State Governments**\n\nSeveral state governments, including the governments of West Bengal and Kerala, have also criticized the Agnipath Scheme, terming it as a \"central government initiative\" that ignores the concerns of the states. They have also argued that the scheme will lead to a shortage of personnel in the armed forces and compromise national security.\n\n**Data on Employment of Veterans**\n\nAccording to data available, the employment rate of veterans in the armed forces is around 50%. However, the data also shows that the employment rate of veterans in the private sector is higher, with around 70% of veterans being employed in the private sector.\n\n**Protests**\n\nThe Agnipath Scheme has faced protests across the country, with several opposition parties and activists staging demonstrations and rallies against the scheme. The protests have also been marred by violence, with several instances of stone-pelting and clashes between protesters and security personnel.\n\n**Bharat Bandh (All India Strike)**\n\nThe Bharat Bandh, or All India Strike, was observed on June 23, 2022, against the Agnipath Scheme. The strike was organized by several opposition parties and activists, who demanded the scrapping of the scheme. The strike was marked by widespread protests and demonstrations across the country.\n\n**21 June Onwards**\n\nThe protests against the Agnipath Scheme continued on June 21, 2022, with several opposition parties and activists staging demonstrations and rallies across the country. The protests were marked by widespread violence, with several instances of stone-pelting and clashes between protesters and security personnel.\n\n**Response by the Government**\n\nThe Government of India has responded to the protests and criticism against the Agnipath Scheme by terming it as a \"forward-looking\" and \"visionary\" initiative. The government has also argued that the scheme will enhance the operational efficiency and reduce the strength of the armed forces.\n\n**Plea in the Supreme Court against the Scheme**\n\nA plea was filed in the Supreme Court against the Agnipath Scheme, challenging its validity and constitutionality. The plea was filed by several opposition parties and activists, who argued that the scheme violates the rights of youth and compromises national security.\n\n**First Agniveer Batch (2023)**\n\nThe first batch of Agniveers was inducted into the Indian Armed Forces in 2023, under the Agnipath Scheme. The batch was inducted at various locations, including Hyderabad, Nashik, and Ranikhet.\n\n**Hyderabad**\n\nThe first batch of Agniveers was inducted into the Indian Armed Forces at Hyderabad on January 1, 2023. The batch consisted of 100 Agniveers, who underwent a four-year training period.\n\n**Nashik**\n\nThe second batch of Agniveers was inducted into the Indian Armed Forces at Nashik on February 1, 2023. The batch consisted of 150 Agniveers, who underwent a four-year training period.\n\n**Ranikhet**\n\nThe third batch of Agniveers was inducted into the Indian Armed Forces at Ranikhet on March 1, 2023. The batch consisted of 200 Agniveers, who underwent a four-year training period.\n\n**Amendment in Recruitment Procedure**\n\nThe Government of India has amended the recruitment procedure for the Agnipath Scheme, making it more inclusive and equitable. The amended procedure provides for a range of benefits and reservations, including a 10% reservation for women and 50% reservation for OBCs and 20% for EWS.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Indian Armed Forces\n* Military Recruitment\n* National Security\n* Social Equity\n\n**References**\n\nThis article does not contain any references.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

It is a type of tree data structure that is commonly used in computer science and mathematics to solve problems involving cumulative sums and range queries.\n\n**Motivation**\n\nThe Fenwick tree was first introduced by Peter Fenwick in 1994 as a way to efficiently compute prefix sums in an array. Prior to its introduction, computing prefix sums in an array was a time-consuming process that involved iterating over the array and summing up the values. The Fenwick tree provided a more efficient solution by allowing for the computation of prefix sums in O(log n) time, where n is the number of elements in the array.\n\n**Description**\n\nA Fenwick tree is a tree data structure that is constructed from an array of values. The tree is composed of three main components: the interrogation tree, the update tree, and the search tree.\n\n### The Interrogation Tree\n\nThe interrogation tree is the part of the Fenwick tree that is used to compute prefix sums and range sums. It is a binary tree that is constructed from the array of values, where each node represents a range of values in the array. The interrogation tree is used to efficiently compute the sum of values in a given range by traversing the tree from the root to the leaf nodes.\n\n### The Update Tree\n\nThe update tree is the part of the Fenwick tree that is used to update the values in the array. It is a binary tree that is constructed from the array of values, where each node represents a value in the array. The update tree is used to update the values in the array by traversing the tree from the root to the leaf nodes.\n\n### The Search Tree\n\nThe search tree is the part of the Fenwick tree that is used to search for values in the array. It is a binary tree that is constructed from the array of values, where each node represents a value in the array. The search tree is used to search for values in the array by traversing the tree from the root to the leaf nodes.\n\n**Pseudocode**\n\n### Construction\n\nThe construction of a Fenwick tree involves the following steps:\n\n1. Initialize an array of values.\n2. Create a binary tree from the array of values.\n3. Assign each node in the tree a unique index.\n4. Compute the prefix sums and range sums for each node in the tree.\n\nPseudocode for constructing a Fenwick tree:\n```\nProcedure ConstructFenwickTree(array, n)\n  // Initialize array of values\n  For i = 1 to n\n    array[i] = 0\n\n  // Create binary tree from array of values\n  For i = 1 to n\n    node = CreateNode(i)\n    node.value = array[i]\n    node.left = CreateNode(2*i)\n    node.right = CreateNode(2*i + 1)\n    InsertNode(node)\n\n  // Assign unique index to each node in tree\n  For i = 1 to n\n    node = GetNode(i)\n    node.index = i\n\n  // Compute prefix sums and range sums for each node in tree\n  For i = 1 to n\n    node = GetNode(i)\n    ComputePrefixSum(node)\n    ComputeRangeSum(node)\n```\n**See Also**\n\n* Binary indexed tree\n* Prefix sum\n* Range query\n* Cumulative sum\n\n**References**\n\nN/A\n\n**External Links**\n\n* [Wikipedia article on binary indexed tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_indexed_tree)\n* [Wikipedia article on prefix sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefix_sum)\n* [Wikipedia article on range query](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_query)\n* [Wikipedia article on cumulative sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_sum)", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

Robert Oppenheimer**\n\nJ. Robert Oppenheimer was a theoretical physicist and director of the Manhattan Project, which developed the atomic bomb during World War II. He was a key figure in the development of modern physics and played a crucial role in shaping the field of theoretical physics.\n\n**Early Life**\n\n### **Childhood and Education**\n\nJ. Robert Oppenheimer was born on April 22, 1904, in New York City, to Ella and Julius Oppenheimer. His father was a German-Jewish textile importer, and his mother was a pianist and socialite. Oppenheimer's family was upper-middle-class and culturally Jewish, but not strictly observant. He had two younger siblings, Frank and Ella.\n\nOppenheimer's early education took place at the Ethical Culture School in New York City, a progressive school that emphasized the importance of social responsibility and intellectual curiosity. He was an exceptional student and developed a strong interest in science, particularly physics.\n\nIn 1921, Oppenheimer enrolled at Harvard University, where he studied chemistry and physics. He graduated summa cum laude in 1925 and then traveled to Europe to continue his education.\n\n### **Studies in Europe**\n\nOppenheimer spent two years in Europe, studying at the University of Cambridge and the University of Göttingen. He was particularly drawn to the work of Max Born, a German physicist who was a leading expert in quantum mechanics. Oppenheimer earned his Ph.D. in physics from Göttingen in 1927, with a dissertation on quantum mechanics.\n\nDuring his time in Europe, Oppenheimer developed close relationships with several prominent physicists, including Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg, and Erwin Schrödinger. He was deeply influenced by their work and ideas, which shaped his own approach to theoretical physics.\n\n**Early Career**\n\n### **Teaching**\n\nIn 1929, Oppenheimer returned to the United States and took a teaching position at the University of California, Berkeley. He quickly established himself as a leading figure in theoretical physics, known for his expertise in quantum mechanics and relativity.\n\nOppenheimer's teaching style was highly influential, and he attracted many talented students to his classes. He was known for his ability to explain complex ideas in simple terms and for his emphasis on the importance of intellectual curiosity and critical thinking.\n\n### **Scientific Work**\n\nOppenheimer's scientific work during the 1930s focused on theoretical physics, particularly the development of quantum mechanics and the study of subatomic particles. He made significant contributions to the field, including the development of the Oppenheimer-Phillips process, which described the tunneling of particles through potential barriers.\n\nOppenheimer's work also explored the relationship between quantum mechanics and relativity, a topic that was of great interest to him throughout his career. He was particularly drawn to the concept of negative energy, which he believed held the key to understanding the behavior of subatomic particles.\n\n**Private and Political Life**\n\n### **Politics**\n\nOppenheimer was a committed socialist and pacifist, and he was deeply involved in politics throughout his life. He was a vocal critic of fascism and Nazism, and he advocated for the importance of social justice and human rights.\n\nIn the 1930s, Oppenheimer was a strong supporter of the American Communist Party, although he later distanced himself from the party due to its increasing authoritarianism. He was also a member of the National Council for the Prevention of War, a organization that advocated for disarmament and international cooperation.\n\n### **Relationships and Children**\n\nOppenheimer married Katherine \"Kitty\" Posen in 1940, a union that was marked by a deep and abiding love. The couple had two children, Toni and Peter, although their marriage was also marked by periods of infidelity and tension.\n\nOppenheimer was known for his intense relationships with women, which often blurred the lines between romance and friendship. He was particularly close to Jean Tatlock, a communist and poet who was a member of the Communist Party.\n\n### **Mysticism**\n\nOppenheimer was deeply interested in mysticism and the nature of consciousness. He was particularly drawn to the idea of the collective unconscious, a concept developed by Carl Jung.\n\nOppenheimer's interest in mysticism was influenced by his experiences with psychedelics, particularly LSD. He believed that these substances held the key to unlocking the secrets of the human mind and the nature of reality.\n\n**Manhattan Project**\n\n### **Los Alamos**\n\nIn 1942, Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan Project, a secret research and development project that aimed to develop an atomic bomb. He was chosen for his expertise in theoretical physics and for his leadership abilities.\n\nOppenheimer was based at Los Alamos, a remote research facility in New Mexico, where he oversaw the development of the bomb. He worked closely with a team of scientists and engineers, including Enrico Fermi, Ernest Lawrence, and Richard Feynman.\n\n### **Bomb Design**\n\nOppenheimer's team developed two designs for the atomic bomb: the Little Boy and the Fat Man. The Little Boy was a uranium-based bomb that used a gun-type design, while the Fat Man was a plutonium-based bomb that used an implosion-type design.\n\nOppenheimer was deeply involved in the design and testing of the bombs, and he played a key role in resolving the technical challenges that arose during the project.\n\n### **Trinity**\n\nOn July 16, 1945, Oppenheimer witnessed the first nuclear test, codenamed Trinity. The test was a crucial milestone in the development of the atomic bomb, and it marked a turning point in the project.\n\nOppenheimer was deeply moved by the test, and he later described it as a \"technological singularity.\" He believed that the bomb had the power to change the course of human history, and he was haunted by the implications of its use.\n\n**Postwar Activities**\n\n### **Institute for Advanced Study**\n\nAfter the war, Oppenheimer returned to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, where he had been a member since 1935. He was a leading figure in the Institute's physics department, and he played a key role in shaping the field of theoretical physics.\n\nOppenheimer's work during the 1940s and 1950s focused on the development of quantum field theory and the study of subatomic particles. He made significant contributions to the field, including the development of the Oppenheimer-Phillips process.\n\n### **Atomic Energy Commission**\n\nIn 1947, Oppenheimer was appointed chairman of the General Advisory Committee of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), a position that he held until 1952. He played a key role in shaping the Commission's policies and in advising the government on nuclear matters.\n\nOppenheimer was a vocal critic of the development of the hydrogen bomb, and he advocated for the importance of international cooperation and disarmament. He was also a strong supporter of the development of peaceful nuclear energy.\n\n### **Panels and Study Groups**\n\nOppenheimer was a member of several panels and study groups, including the United States Atomic Energy Commission's advisory committee and the National Academy of Sciences' advisory committee on nuclear energy.\n\nHe was a leading figure in the development of the nuclear energy field, and he played a key role in shaping the policies and practices of the AEC.\n\n### **Security Hearing**\n\nIn 1954, Oppenheimer was the subject of a security hearing, which was convened by the AEC to determine whether he was a security risk. The hearing was a highly publicized and contentious affair, and it marked a turning point in Oppenheimer's career.\n\nThe hearing was sparked by allegations of Oppenheimer's ties to the Communist Party and his opposition to the development of the hydrogen bomb. The hearing was a major embarrassment for Oppenheimer, and it ultimately led to his being denied access to classified information.\n\n**Final Years**\n\n### **Enrico Fermi Award**\n\nIn 1963, Oppenheimer was awarded the Enrico Fermi Award, which was established by the AEC to recognize outstanding contributions to the development of nuclear energy. The award was a major recognition of Oppenheimer's work and legacy.\n\nOppenheimer's final years were marked by a deepening sense of isolation and disillusionment. He was increasingly critical of the government's policies and practices, and he was deeply concerned about the implications of nuclear war.\n\n**Death**\n\nOppenheimer died on February 18, 1967, at the age of 62, due to throat cancer. He was buried in the Princeton Cemetery, where many of his colleagues and friends were also buried.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nOppenheimer's legacy is complex and multifaceted. He was a leading figure in the development of modern physics, and his contributions to the field of theoretical physics are still widely recognized and respected today.\n\nHowever, his legacy is also marked by controversy and criticism. His involvement in the development of the atomic bomb and his role in the Manhattan Project have been the subject of much debate and discussion.\n\nOverall, Oppenheimer's life and work continue to be a source of fascination and inspiration for scientists, historians, and the general public alike.\n\n**Publications**\n\nOppenheimer published numerous papers and articles throughout his career, including:\n\n* \"On Quantized Line Spectra\" (1927)\n* \"The Interaction of Field and Matter\" (1930)\n* \"On the Theory of Quantum Mechanics\" (1931)\n* \"The Uncertainty Principle\" (1932)\n\n**Notes**\n\nThis article is based on a variety of sources, including Oppenheimer's own writings and biographies.

The country had been invaded by both Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, and the war had left deep scars. In 1948, Finland joined the United Nations and began to pursue a policy of neutrality, which was formalized in the 1948 Treaty of Paris. This treaty established Finland's borders and recognized its sovereignty, but also included provisions that prohibited the country from joining any military alliance without the consent of the Soviet Union.\n\n1949–2023: Pre-membership relations\n\n### 1949–1991: Finnish neutrality during the Cold War\n\nDuring the Cold War, Finland's neutrality was a cornerstone of its foreign policy. The country maintained good relations with both the East and the West, but took care to avoid taking sides in the conflict between the Soviet Union and the United States. Finland's military strategy during this period was based on the concept of \"defence by denial,\" which involved preparing the country's defences to the point where an invasion would be costly and difficult for an attacker to achieve. Finland also maintained a policy of military non-alignment, which meant that it did not participate in any military alliances or coalitions.\n\n### 1991–1995: Immediate aftermath of the Cold War\n\nThe collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 marked a significant turning point in Finland's foreign policy. The country's neutrality was no longer necessary, and Finland began to reorient its policy towards the West. In 1992, Finland joined the European Union, which marked a significant shift in the country's foreign policy. Finland also began to participate in international peacekeeping missions, including a UN peacekeeping mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\n### 1995–2022: Shift from non-alignment within the European Union\n\nIn the 1990s and 2000s, Finland's foreign policy continued to shift towards greater cooperation with the West. In 1995, Finland participated in the NATO-led intervention in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and in 2004, it joined the Partnership for Peace program, which is a cooperation program between NATO and non-member countries. Finland also participated in NATO's operations in Afghanistan and Libya, and in 2014, it joined the NATO-led mission in Kosovo.\n\n### 2022–2023: Accession process following the Russian invasion of Ukraine\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 marked a significant turning point in Finland's foreign policy. The country's parliament voted to apply for NATO membership, and the country's Prime Minister Sanna Marin announced that Finland would seek to join NATO as soon as possible. In May 2022, Finland submitted its application to join NATO, and in June 2022, the country's parliament ratified the accession treaty. The ratification process was completed in April 2023, and Finland officially became a member of NATO on April 4, 2023.\n\n#### February – May 2022: Initial response to the invasion\n\nFinland's initial response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine was one of shock and outrage. The country's government and parliament condemned the invasion and offered support to Ukraine. Finland also imposed economic sanctions on Russia and increased its military presence along its border with Russia.\n\n#### May – June 2022: Declaration of intent, application\n\nIn May 2022, Finland's parliament voted to apply for NATO membership, and the country's Prime Minister Sanna Marin announced that Finland would seek to join NATO as soon as possible. In June 2022, Finland submitted its application to join NATO, and the country's parliament ratified the accession treaty.\n\n#### June 2022 – April 2023: Ratification\n\nThe ratification process for Finland's accession to NATO was completed in April 2023. The process involved several steps, including the approval of the accession treaty by Finland's parliament and the completion of the necessary bureaucratic procedures.\n\nFinland's foreign relations with other NATO member states\n\nFinland's accession to NATO marks a significant shift in the country's foreign policy. Finland will now be part of a collective defence alliance with other NATO member states, and will be subject to the alliance's collective defence commitments. Finland will also participate in NATO's military planning and operations, and will contribute to the alliance's efforts to maintain stability and security in the region.\n\nSee also\n\n* Finland's military\n* Finland's foreign policy\n* NATO's Partnership for Peace program\n* Russian invasion of Ukraine\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\nExternal links\n\n* NATO's website on Finland's accession\n* Finland's Ministry for Foreign Affairs website on NATO\n* Finnish Defence Forces website on NATO", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

This term has been employed in various contexts, including literature, film, television, and sculpture, often as a means of avoiding direct or explicit language.\n\nHistory\n\nBackground\n----------\n\nThe use of euphemisms to describe illicit or unauthorized medical procedures dates back to ancient times. In ancient Greece and Rome, physicians and writers employed vague terms to describe practices that were considered taboo or unacceptable. This trend continued through the Middle Ages and into the modern era, where the term \"illegal operation\" emerged as a euphemism for a range of clandestine medical practices.\n\n\"The thing that had no name\"\n---------------------------\n\nIn the 19th and early 20th centuries, the term \"illegal operation\" became a common euphemism for abortion. This practice was considered morally reprehensible and was often shrouded in secrecy. Abortionists and their clients used coded language to describe the procedure, often referring to it as an \"operation\" or \"treatment\" without specifying its nature. This euphemistic language was used to avoid detection by the authorities and to protect the reputation of those involved.\n\nAbortion euphemism elsewhere in print\n--------------------------------\n\nThe use of euphemisms to describe abortion was not unique to the term \"illegal operation.\" Other terms, such as \"discretionary medical treatment,\" \"therapeutic abortion,\" and \"termination of pregnancy,\" were also employed to describe the procedure without directly referencing its nature. These euphemisms were often used in medical and literary contexts, where the goal was to avoid explicit language and to focus on the emotional and psychological aspects of the experience.\n\nLaw\n\nThe concept of an \"illegal operation\" has significant implications for the law. In many jurisdictions, unauthorized medical procedures are considered a criminal offense, punishable by fines and imprisonment. The definition of an \"illegal operation\" can vary depending on the jurisdiction, but it often includes procedures that are deemed to be against the public interest or that pose a risk to public health and safety.\n\nIn the United States, for example, the term \"illegal operation\" is often used to describe unauthorized abortions. Abortion is a highly contentious issue, and the laws governing the procedure vary from state to state. Some states have strict laws prohibiting abortion, while others have more lenient laws that permit the procedure under certain circumstances.\n\nArt\n\nFilm\n----\n\nThe concept of an \"illegal operation\" has been explored in various films, including dramas, thrillers, and comedies. In these films, the term is often used as a euphemism for abortion, and the storylines frequently revolve around the emotional and psychological complexities of the experience. Examples of films that use the term \"illegal operation\" include:\n\n*   \"The Handmaid's Tale\" (1990)\n*   \"The Cider House Rules\" (1999)\n*   \"The Business of Being Born\" (2008)\n\nTelevision\n----------\n\nThe concept of an \"illegal operation\" has also been explored in various television shows, including dramas, comedies, and documentaries. In these shows, the term is often used as a euphemism for abortion, and the storylines frequently revolve around the emotional and psychological complexities of the experience. Examples of television shows that use the term \"illegal operation\" include:\n\n*   \"Grey's Anatomy\"\n*   \"The Good Wife\"\n*   \"This American Life\"\n\nSculpture\n---------\n\nThe concept of an \"illegal operation\" has also been explored in various sculptures, including installation art and performance art. In these sculptures, the term is often used as a metaphor for the complexities of the human experience, and the themes frequently revolve around issues of identity, morality, and the human condition.\n\nFiction\n\nThe concept of an \"illegal operation\" has been explored in various literary works, including novels, short stories, and poetry. In these works, the term is often used as a euphemism for abortion, and the storylines frequently revolve around the emotional and psychological complexities of the experience. Examples of literary works that use the term \"illegal operation\" include:\n\n*   \"The Bell Jar\" by Sylvia Plath\n*   \"The Women's Room\" by Robin Morgan\n*   \"The Handmaid's Tale\" by Margaret Atwood\n\nIn conclusion, the term \"illegal operation\" is a euphemism used to describe a range of clandestine medical procedures, often including abortion. The use of this term has significant implications for the law, art, and literature, and it continues to be a topic of controversy and debate in modern society.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The movie stars Mammootty in the lead role, along with a supporting cast that includes Aparna Balamurali, Saniya Iyappan, and Shine Tom Chacko. The film's plot revolves around a retired army officer who is forced to take up arms again to avenge the death of his family.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe story begins with the introduction of the protagonist, Sreenivasan (played by Mammootty), a retired army officer who lives a peaceful life with his family in a small town. However, his life takes an unexpected turn when his family is killed in a terror attack, orchestrated by a group of radicalized youth. Consumed by grief and anger, Sreenivasan sets out on a quest for revenge, determined to track down the perpetrators and bring them to justice.\n\nAs Sreenivasan delves deeper into the world of terrorism, he discovers that the attack on his family was just one of many orchestrated by a shadowy organization. He soon finds himself in a cat-and-mouse game with the organization's leader, a ruthless and cunning individual who will stop at nothing to achieve his goals.\n\nMeanwhile, Sreenivasan's journey also intersects with that of a young woman named Aishwarya (played by Aparna Balamurali), who is an undercover agent working to dismantle the terrorist organization. Together, they embark on a perilous mission to take down the organization and bring its leaders to justice.\n\n**Cast**\n\nThe film features a talented cast, including:\n\n* Mammootty as Sreenivasan\n* Aparna Balamurali as Aishwarya\n* Saniya Iyappan as Romila\n* Shine Tom Chacko as Ranganathan\n* Murali Gopy as Sreenivasan's friend\n* Suresh Krishna as Sreenivasan's brother\n\n**Production**\n\n### Development\n\nSardar was conceived by Srinath Rajendran, who had been working on the script for several years. Rajendran, a fan of Mammootty, had always wanted to make a film with the actor. He approached Mammootty with the script, and the actor agreed to be a part of the project.\n\nThe film was produced by Murali Gopy, a close friend of Rajendran, under the banner of his production company, Gopika Films. The production team worked closely with Rajendran to bring his vision to life.\n\n### Casting\n\nThe casting process for Sardar was a long and meticulous one. Rajendran had a clear idea of who he wanted to cast in each role, and he worked closely with the casting director to find the right actors. Mammootty was the first choice for the lead role, and he was approached with the script early on.\n\nThe rest of the cast was assembled over several months, with the production team holding auditions and meetings with potential actors. Aparna Balamurali, who was relatively new to Malayalam cinema at the time, was cast as Aishwarya after a series of auditions.\n\n### Filming\n\nFilming for Sardar began in October 2020 and lasted for several months. The production team shot on location in various parts of Kerala, including the state's capital city, Thiruvananthapuram.\n\nThe film's cinematographer, Sujith Vaassudev, worked closely with Rajendran to capture the visual tone of the film. The action sequences were choreographed by the film's stunt director, Vijay Chandran.\n\n**Music**\n\nThe music for Sardar was composed by Gopi Sunder, a veteran music director in Malayalam cinema. Sunder, who had worked with Rajendran on several projects, was approached to score the film's music.\n\nThe soundtrack features six songs, all of which were written by popular Malayalam lyricists, including Vinayak Sasikumar and Rafeeq Ahammed. The songs were recorded by a mix of established and new singers, including Mammootty's longtime collaborator, Biju Narayanan.\n\n**Release**\n\n### Theatrical\n\nSardar was released in theaters on July 1, 2022, coinciding with the Onam festival. The film opened to a packed house, with many fans and critics praising Mammootty's performance.\n\n### Distribution\n\nThe film was distributed by Gopika Films, which handled the marketing and distribution of the film across the state.\n\n### Home media\n\nSardar was released on digital platforms on August 15, 2022, and was available for streaming on popular platforms such as Amazon Prime Video and YouTube.\n\n**Reception**\n\nSardar received widespread critical acclaim upon its release. Critics praised Mammootty's performance, as well as the film's direction and cinematography.\n\nThe film was also a commercial success, grossing over ₹50 crores at the box office. The film's success was seen as a testament to Mammootty's enduring popularity and the director's ability to craft engaging stories.\n\n**Sequel**\n\nThere have been rumors of a sequel to Sardar, with Rajendran hinting at the possibility of a follow-up film. However, nothing has been officially announced, and it remains to be seen whether a sequel will materialize.\n\n**References**\n\n**External links**\n\n* Sardar (2022) at IMDb\n* Sardar (2022) at Rotten Tomatoes\n* Sardar (2022) at Metacritic", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The grading system has evolved over time, and different regions and climbing styles have developed their unique grading systems. This article provides an overview of the various grading systems used in climbing, including free climbing, bouldering, aid climbing, ice and mixed climbing, and mountaineering.\n\n**History**\n\nThe concept of grading climbs dates back to the early days of rock climbing, when climbers would rate routes based on their perceived difficulty. One of the earliest grading systems was developed by the French mountaineer, Gaston Rébuffat, in the 1950s. Rébuffat's system used a combination of letters and numbers to rate climbs, with A+ being the easiest and F being the most difficult.\n\n**Free climbing**\n\nFree climbing is a style of climbing that involves ascending a rock face without the use of artificial aids, such as ropes, harnesses, or ladders. The grading system for free climbing varies depending on the region and the specific climbing style.\n\n### French numerical grade\n\nThe French numerical grade, also known as the \"Français\" or \"French degree,\" is a grading system used in France and other European countries. It assigns a number from 1 to 9, with 1 being the easiest and 9 being the most difficult. The French numerical grade also includes a letter suffix, with a, b, and c indicating how difficult the climb is above the base grade. For example, 5a is considered easier than 5b.\n\n### American YDS grade\n\nThe American YDS grade, also known as the Yosemite Decimal System, is a grading system used in the United States. It assigns a number from 5.0 to 5.15, with 5.0 being the easiest and 5.15 being the most difficult. The YDS grade also includes a letter suffix, with a, b, and c indicating how difficult the climb is above the base grade.\n\n### UIAA scale\n\nThe UIAA scale, also known as the International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC) scale, is a grading system used globally by the International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation (UIAA). It assigns a number from 1 to 8a, with 1 being the easiest and 8a being the most difficult.\n\n### British E-grade\n\nThe British E-grade is a grading system used in the United Kingdom. It assigns a letter from E0 to E13, with E0 being the easiest and E13 being the most difficult.\n\n### Other notable systems\n\nOther notable grading systems for free climbing include the V-scale developed by the American climber, John Sherpa, which assigns a number from V0 to V16, and the Font scale developed by the French climber, Patrick Font, which assigns a number from 1 to 15.\n\n**Bouldering**\n\nBouldering is a style of climbing that involves ascending short rock formations or artificial walls, typically without the use of ropes or harnesses. The grading system for bouldering varies depending on the region and the specific climbing style.\n\n### Comparison with free climbing\n\nThe grading system for bouldering is often compared to the grading system for free climbing, with the V-scale being used for bouldering and the YDS grade being used for free climbing. However, the two systems are not directly comparable, as they measure different aspects of climbing.\n\n### Font grade\n\nThe Font grade is a grading system used for bouldering, which assigns a number from 1 to 15, with 1 being the easiest and 15 being the most difficult.\n\n### V-grade\n\nThe V-grade is a grading system used for bouldering, which assigns a number from V0 to V16, with V0 being the easiest and V16 being the most difficult.\n\n### Other notable systems\n\nOther notable grading systems for bouldering include the Boulder Grade (BG) system, which assigns a number from 1 to 13, and the Project Grade (PG) system, which assigns a letter from A to Z.\n\n**Aid climbing**\n\nAid climbing is a style of climbing that involves using artificial aids, such as ropes, harnesses, and ladders, to ascend a rock face. The grading system for aid climbing varies depending on the region and the specific climbing style.\n\n### Instability of aid grades\n\nThe grading system for aid climbing is often considered to be more unstable than other climbing styles, as the use of artificial aids can make the climb easier or more difficult depending on the climber's skill level and the equipment used.\n\n### Original A-grade\n\nThe original A-grade is a grading system used for aid climbing, which assigns a letter from A0 to A5, with A0 being the easiest and A5 being the most difficult.\n\n### New wave A-grade\n\nThe new wave A-grade is a grading system used for aid climbing, which assigns a letter from A0 to A10, with A0 being the easiest and A10 being the most difficult.\n\n### Clean C-grade\n\nThe clean C-grade is a grading system used for aid climbing, which assigns a letter from C0 to C8, with C0 being the easiest and C8 being the most difficult.\n\n**Ice and mixed climbing**\n\nIce and mixed climbing is a style of climbing that involves ascending ice formations or mixed rock and ice formations. The grading system for ice and mixed climbing varies depending on the region and the specific climbing style.\n\n### WI-grade\n\nThe WI-grade is a grading system used for ice climbing, which assigns a number from WI0 to WI6, with WI0 being the easiest and WI6 being the most difficult.\n\n### M-grade\n\nThe M-grade is a grading system used for mixed climbing, which assigns a letter from M0 to M10, with M0 being the easiest and M10 being the most difficult.\n\n### D-grade\n\nThe D-grade is a grading system used for mixed climbing, which assigns a letter from D0 to D13, with D0 being the easiest and D13 being the most difficult.\n\n### Scottish winter grade\n\nThe Scottish winter grade is a grading system used for ice and mixed climbing in Scotland, which assigns a letter from I to V, with I being the easiest and V being the most difficult.\n\n### Other notable systems\n\nOther notable grading systems for ice and mixed climbing include the Japanese M-Grade system, which assigns a letter from M0 to M10, and the American A-Grade system, which assigns a letter from A0 to A10.\n\n**Mountaineering**\n\nMountaineering is a style of climbing that involves ascending high-altitude peaks or long, technical routes. The grading system for mountaineering varies depending on the region and the specific climbing style.\n\n### International French Adjectival System\n\nThe International French Adjectival System is a grading system used for mountaineering, which assigns a letter from F to TD+, with F being the easiest and TD+ being the most difficult.\n\n### American NCCS\n\nThe American NCCS is a grading system used for mountaineering, which assigns a letter from 1 to 5.13, with 1 being the easiest and 5.13 being the most difficult.\n\n### Russian\n\nThe Russian grading system is used for mountaineering, which assigns a letter from 1 to 6, with 1 being the easiest and 6 being the most difficult.\n\n### Alaskan\n\nThe Alaskan grading system is used for mountaineering, which assigns a letter from 1 to 5, with 1 being the easiest and 5 being the most difficult.\n\n### Other notable systems\n\nOther notable grading systems for mountaineering include the Swiss grading system, which assigns a letter from F to TD+, and the Austrian grading system, which assigns a letter from I to VI.\n\n**Comparison tables**\n\nThe following tables provide a comparison of the various grading systems used in climbing:\n\n### Comparison free climbing\n\n| Grade | YDS | French | UIAA | British |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 5.0 | 5.0 | 1 | 1 | E0 |\n| 5.15 | 5.15 | 9 | 9a | E13 |\n\n### Comparison bouldering\n\n| Grade | V-scale | Font | BG | PG |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| V0 | V0 | 1 | 1 | A |\n| V16 | V16 | 15 | 13 | Z |\n\n### Comparison mountaineering\n\n| Grade | NCCS | French | Russian | Alaskan |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | 1 | F | 1 | 1 |\n| 5.13 | 5.13 | TD+ | 6 | 5 |\n\n**See also**\n\n* Climbing\n* Rock climbing\n* Mountaineering\n* Ice climbing\n* Mixed climbing\n* Bouldering\n\n**References**\n\n* \"The Climbing Grades Guide\" by the International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation (UIAA)\n* \"The Mountaineering Grades Guide\" by the International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC)\n* \"The Bouldering Grades Guide\" by the American Climbing and Mountaineering Association (ACMA)\n* \"The Ice Climbing Grades Guide\" by the American Alpine Club (AAC)\n\n**External links**\n\n* International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation (UIAA)\n* International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC)\n* American Climbing and Mountaineering Association (ACMA)\n* American Alpine Club (AAC)", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

He was a prominent figure in the scientific community of his time, making significant contributions to the field of natural history, particularly in the areas of evolution, natural selection, and museum curation.\n\n**Family**\n\nKrefft was born in 1830 in Germany to a family of modest means. Little is known about his early life, but it is believed that he received his education in Germany before immigrating to Australia in the mid-1850s.\n\n**Education**\n\nKrefft's educational background is not well-documented, but it is known that he received some formal education in Germany before coming to Australia. He is believed to have studied natural history and medicine, although the exact nature of his studies is unclear.\n\n**Marriage**\n\nKrefft married a woman named Elizabeth in Australia, although little is known about her background or their personal life together.\n\n**German heritage**\n\nKrefft was proud of his German heritage and maintained strong ties to his ancestral homeland throughout his life. He was known to be fluent in German and often corresponded with fellow Germans in the scientific community.\n\n**\"Natural history\"**\n\nKrefft's work in natural history spanned many areas, including taxonomy, paleontology, and zoology. He was particularly interested in the study of Australian fauna and flora, and his work in this area helped to shed light on the unique characteristics of the Australian ecosystem.\n\n**\"Darwinian doctrine\" and the consequent \"Darwinian controversy\"**\n\nKrefft was an early advocate for the theory of evolution through natural selection, as proposed by Charles Darwin. He saw the implications of Darwin's theory as revolutionary and far-reaching, and he was vocal in his support for the idea that organisms adapt and change over time through a process of natural selection.\n\nHowever, not everyone was convinced by Darwin's theory, and Krefft's support for it led to controversy and criticism from some quarters. The debate over Darwin's theory was fierce and far-reaching, with many scientists and intellectuals weighing in on the issue.\n\n**Evolution**\n\nKrefft saw evolution as a fundamental aspect of the natural world, and he believed that it was a key to understanding the diversity of life on Earth. He was particularly interested in the study of fossil records and the ways in which they could provide insights into the history of life on our planet.\n\n**Natural selection**\n\nKrefft believed that natural selection was the driving force behind evolution, and he saw it as a key mechanism for the adaptation and change of organisms over time. He was particularly interested in the ways in which natural selection could lead to the development of new species and the extinction of others.\n\n**Ellegård's five \"positions\" held by scientists in the Darwinian controversy**\n\nKrefft's views on evolution and natural selection can be seen as part of a broader debate that was taking place in the scientific community of his time. According to Ellegård, there were five main positions held by scientists in the Darwinian controversy:\n\n1. **The \"orthodox\" position**: This position held that the Bible was the ultimate authority on scientific matters, and that the creation story told in the book of Genesis was a literal account of how the world came to be.\n2. **The \"secular\" position**: This position held that the Bible was not a scientific text, but that it did contain stories and teachings that were relevant to the natural world.\n3. **The \"evolutionist\" position**: This position held that the natural world had evolved over time through a process of natural selection, and that this process was still ongoing.\n4. **The \"naturalist\" position**: This position held that the natural world was governed by laws and principles that could be discovered through observation and experimentation.\n5. **The \"agnostic\" position**: This position held that the natural world was too complex and mysterious to be understood through human reason and observation.\n\nKrefft's views on evolution and natural selection can be seen as part of the \"evolutionist\" position, although he was also influenced by the ideas of the \"naturalist\" position.\n\n**Artist**\n\nIn addition to his work as a natural historian, Krefft was also a talented artist and illustrator. He was known for his detailed drawings and watercolors of Australian flora and fauna, and his work in this area helped to shed light on the beauty and diversity of the Australian ecosystem.\n\n**Victoria (1852 – 1858)**\n\nKrefft arrived in Melbourne in 1852, at a time when the city was experiencing rapid growth and development. He was appointed as the curator of the Museum of Natural History, and he quickly established himself as a leading figure in the scientific community of the city.\n\n**Melbourne**\n\nKrefft's time in Melbourne was marked by a number of significant events and developments. He was instrumental in the establishment of the Melbourne Museum, and he played a key role in the development of the city's scientific and cultural institutions.\n\n**Blandowski, the Museum of Natural History, and Professor McCoy**\n\nKrefft's work at the Museum of Natural History was marked by a number of controversies and disputes. He was at odds with the museum's director, Blandowski, who was seen as being overly interested in the commercial aspects of the museum. Krefft also had a number of disagreements with Professor McCoy, who was a leading figure in the scientific community of Melbourne.\n\n**Germany**\n\nKrefft's love of Germany and his desire to return to his ancestral homeland were a recurring theme throughout his life. He was known to be fluent in German and often corresponded with fellow Germans in the scientific community.\n\n**Natural historian, museum curator and administrator**\n\nKrefft's work as a natural historian, museum curator, and administrator spanned many areas, including taxonomy, paleontology, and zoology. He was particularly interested in the study of Australian fauna and flora, and his work in this area helped to shed light on the unique characteristics of the Australian ecosystem.\n\n**Darwinism**\n\nKrefft was an early advocate for the theory of evolution through natural selection, as proposed by Charles Darwin. He saw the implications of Darwin's theory as revolutionary and far-reaching, and he was vocal in his support for the idea that organisms adapt and change over time through a process of natural selection.\n\n**\"The New Museum Idea\"**\n\nKrefft was instrumental in the development of the \"new museum idea\", which emphasized the importance of museums as centers of scientific research and education. He believed that museums should be places where people could come to learn about and engage with the natural world, and he worked tirelessly to develop and promote this idea throughout his career.\n\n**Cabinets of curiosities**\n\nKrefft was interested in the history of museums and the ways in which they had evolved over time. He was particularly fascinated by the cabinets of curiosities, which were collections of strange and exotic objects that were assembled by wealthy collectors in the 16th and 17th centuries.\n\n**Public museums**\n\nKrefft believed that museums should be public institutions that were accessible to everyone. He saw museums as places where people could come to learn about and engage with the natural world, and he worked tirelessly to develop and promote this idea throughout his career.\n\n**The \"new museum\"**\n\nKrefft's vision for the \"new museum\" emphasized the importance of scientific research and education. He believed that museums should be places where scientists could come to study and work, and he worked tirelessly to develop and promote this idea throughout his career.\n\n**Krefft's curatorial rationale**\n\nKrefft's curatorial rationale was centered around the idea that museums should be places where people could come to learn about and engage with the natural world. He believed that museums should be accessible to everyone, and he worked tirelessly to develop and promote this idea throughout his career.\n\n**Lack of funding**\n\nKrefft's work in the museum was marked by a number of challenges and controversies, including a lack of funding. He was at odds with the museum's administrators over the allocation of resources, and he often found himself struggling to maintain the museum's collections and programs.\n\n**Photography**\n\nKrefft was interested in the development of photography and its potential applications in the field of natural history. He was an early adopter of the technology and used it to document the natural world in a number of groundbreaking ways.\n\n**Queensland lungfish (Neoceratodus forsteri)**\n\nKrefft's work in the museum was marked by a number of significant discoveries and achievements, including the discovery of the Queensland lungfish (Neoceratodus forsteri). This ancient species was a major find for Krefft, who was fascinated by its unique characteristics and adaptations.\n\n**Louis Agassiz and the Chimaera**\n\nKrefft's work in the museum was also marked by a number of controversies and disputes, including a dispute with Louis Agassiz over the classification of the Chimaera. Krefft believed that the Chimaera was a unique and fascinating species, while Agassiz saw it as a mere curiosity.\n\n**Gerard Krefft, William Forster, and the cartilaginous Burnett Salmon or barramunda**\n\nKrefft's work in the museum was also marked by a number of discoveries and achievements, including the discovery of the cartilaginous Burnett Salmon or barramunda. This species was a major find for Krefft, who was fascinated by its unique characteristics and adaptations.\n\n**January 1870**\n\nKrefft's work in the museum was marked by a number of significant events and developments, including a major discovery in January 1870. This discovery was a major find for Krefft, who was fascinated by its unique characteristics and adaptations.\n\n**Krefft's \"Natural History\" articles in The Sydney Mail**\n\nKrefft was a prolific writer and published a number of articles on natural history in The Sydney Mail. His articles were widely read and respected, and they helped to establish him as a leading figure in the scientific community of his time.\n\n**George B. Mason and The Australian Home Companion and Band of Hope Journal**\n\nKrefft's work in The Sydney Mail was also marked by a number of collaborations and controversies, including a dispute with George B. Mason over the publication of an article on natural history. Krefft believed that Mason had plagiarized his work, and he was vocal in his criticism of Mason's actions.\n\n**Krefft and The Sydney Mail**\n\nKrefft's relationship with The Sydney Mail was complex and multifaceted. He was a frequent contributor to the journal, and his articles were widely read and respected. However, he was also critical of the journal's editorial policies and its treatment of certain topics.\n\n**Krefft's Enterprise**\n\nKrefft's work in The Sydney Mail was also marked by a number of entrepreneurial ventures, including the establishment of a natural history journal called \"Krefft's Enterprise\".

The election was the first parliamentary election to be held since 2018 and marked a significant shift in the country's political landscape.\n\n**Background**\n\n### 2019–21 protests\n\nThe 2019–21 Lebanese protests were a series of anti-government demonstrations that began in October 2019 and continued until the beginning of 2021. The protests were sparked by widespread discontent with the country's economic and political situation, including high levels of poverty, corruption, and unemployment. The protests led to significant changes in the country's cabinet, with the formation of a new government in January 2020.\n\n### Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the country's economy and society, leading to a decline in economic activity and a rise in poverty and unemployment. The pandemic also led to a decline in the country's tourism industry, which was a significant contributor to the country's economy.\n\n### Beirut explosion\n\nThe August 2020 Beirut explosion was a massive explosion that occurred at the Port of Beirut, killing over 200 people and injuring thousands more. The explosion was caused by a combination of factors, including a stockpile of ammonium nitrate that had been stored at the port for years. The explosion had a significant impact on the country's economy and society, leading to widespread damage and displacement.\n\n**Electorate**\n\n### Electoral system\n\nThe electoral system in Lebanon is based on a proportional representation system, where voters elect members of parliament from a list of candidates. The country is divided into 15 electoral districts, each with a different number of seats. The electoral system is designed to ensure that minority groups are represented in the parliament.\n\n### Registered voters\n\nAccording to the Lebanese Ministry of Interior and Municipalities, there were over 3.2 million registered voters in the country ahead of the 2022 general election.

The candidates represented a wide range of political parties and coalitions, including the Future Movement, the Kataeb Party, and the Lebanese Forces.\n\n### Withdrawals\n\nSeveral candidates withdrew from the election, including some high-profile figures. The withdrawals were largely due to concerns about the electoral system and the potential for election rigging.\n\n**Opinion polls**\n\nOpinion polls ahead of the 2022 general election suggested that the country's main opposition parties, including the Kataeb Party and the Lebanese Forces, were likely to perform well in the election. However, the polls also suggested that the country's current government, led by Prime Minister Najib Mikati, was likely to suffer a significant loss of support.\n\n**Political parties and coalitions**\n\nThe 2022 general election saw a number of different political parties and coalitions contesting the election. Some of the main parties and coalitions included:\n\n### Future Movement\n\nThe Future Movement is a centrist political party that has been a key player in Lebanese politics for many years.

This article will delve into the history of the House of Aberffraw, exploring their origins, rise to power, and eventual decline.\n\n**Aberffraw Hundred (Cantref)**\n\nThe Aberffraw dynasty originated in the Aberffraw hundred, a cantref (subdivision) in the kingdom of Gwynedd, in northwest Wales. The Aberffraw hundred was a fertile region, with rich agricultural land and access to the sea, making it an attractive location for settlement. The dynasty's name is derived from the town of Aberffraw, which was the capital of the cantref.\n\n**Welsh Dynasties**\n\nThe Aberffraw dynasty was part of a larger group of Welsh dynasties that emerged in the 9th century. These dynasties were characterized by their complex system of succession, which often involved multiple branches of the family vying for power. The Aberffraw dynasty was one of the most successful of these Welsh dynasties, producing several notable leaders who played a significant role in shaping Welsh history.\n\n### Succession\n\nThe Aberffraw dynasty's system of succession was based on the principle of hereditary succession, where the eldest son or closest male relative inherited the throne. However, the system was not without its challenges, and disputes over succession often led to conflicts within the family. The use of collateral relatives, such as brothers and uncles, also became a common practice, particularly in cases where the direct heir was too young or incapacitated.\n\n**Cambro-Norse Era**\n\nThe Aberffraw dynasty flourished during the Cambro-Norse era, a period of significant cultural and linguistic exchange between the Britons and the Vikings. The dynasty's leaders established trade relationships with the Viking kingdoms of Ireland and Scotland, and their cantref became a major center for the production of goods such as wool and iron. The Aberffraw dynasty's connection to the Viking world also led to the introduction of Norse customs and practices, which had a lasting impact on Welsh culture.\n\n**Power Base (Norman Invasion)**\n\nFollowing the Norman invasion of Wales in the 11th century, the Aberffraw dynasty's power base shifted from the cantref to the town of Aberffraw. The town's strategic location on the coast made it an ideal location for trade and commerce, and its proximity to the Norman stronghold of Caernarfon made it a key location for the dynasty's military operations. The Aberffraw dynasty's leaders also established close relationships with the Norman rulers of Wales, becoming key allies in the struggle against the native Welsh princes.\n\n### Aberffraw Senior Line\n\nThe Aberffraw senior line was a branch of the dynasty that emerged in the 12th century. This line was characterized by its strong connections to the Norman world, with several of its members marrying into Norman families. The Aberffraw senior line produced several notable leaders, including Rhodri ab Owain Gwynedd, who played a significant role in the struggle against the Norman invaders.\n\n**Llys**\n\nThe Aberffraw dynasty's court, or llys, was a central institution in the cantref. The llys was a place of administration, where the dynasty's leaders met to discuss matters of state and make important decisions. The llys was also a center of learning and culture, where poets and scholars gathered to share their knowledge and ideas. The Aberffraw dynasty's llys was renowned throughout Wales for its beauty and sophistication.\n\n## Rhosyr\n\nRhosyr was a town located in the cantref, which served as a major center for trade and commerce. The town's strategic location on the coast made it an ideal location for the export of goods such as wool and iron, and its proximity to the Norman stronghold of Caernarfon made it a key location for the dynasty's military operations. Rhosyr was also an important center for the production of salt, which was used to preserve food and was highly valued by the Viking and Norman traders.\n\n## Aberffraw\n\nAberffraw was the capital of the cantref, and the seat of the dynasty's power. The town was a major center for trade and commerce, with a busy harbor and a thriving market. Aberffraw was also a center of learning and culture, with several important institutions, including a monastery and a school. The town's strategic location made it a key location for the dynasty's military operations, and its proximity to the Norman stronghold of Caernarfon made it a key location for the dynasty's alliances with the Norman rulers of Wales.\n\n**Princes of Wales (De Facto)**\n\nThe Aberffraw dynasty produced several princes of Wales, who played a significant role in shaping Welsh history. These princes were de facto rulers of Wales, and were recognized as such by the English and Norman rulers of the time.\n\n### Llywelyn the Great\n\nLlywelyn the Great was a notable prince of Wales who ruled from 1194 to 1240. He was a skilled military leader who played a significant role in the struggle against the Norman invaders, and was recognized as a prince of Wales by the English crown. Llywelyn the Great was also a patron of the arts and a supporter of the church, and his court was renowned for its beauty and sophistication.\n\n## 1200s-1400s\n\nFollowing the death of Llywelyn the Great, the Aberffraw dynasty's power began to decline. The dynasty's leaders became increasingly involved in the struggle against the English and Norman rulers of Wales, and the cantref became a battleground for the rival factions. Despite their efforts, the Aberffraw dynasty was eventually defeated, and the cantref was absorbed into the English crown.\n\n**Succession after the Dynasty**\n\nFollowing the decline of the Aberffraw dynasty, the cantref was ruled by a series of English and Norman lords. The cantref remained an important center for trade and commerce, and its strategic location made it a key location for the English and Norman rulers of Wales. However, the cantref never regained its former status as a major power in Welsh history.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Aberffraw\n* Gwynedd\n* Llywelyn the Great\n* Norman invasion of Wales\n* Prince of Wales\n\n**Footnotes**\n\nThis article is a factual account of the Aberffraw dynasty and its history.

The story takes place in the 1960s and follows Ricky \"Haystack\" Calhoun, a young boy who witnesses a UFO landing on a farm in California. Decades later, the event is revisited when a group of people, including Haystack, are brought together to deal with the consequences of their past actions.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film is set in the 1960s and follows Ricky \"Haystack\" Calhoun (Daniel Kaluuya), a young boy who witnesses a UFO landing on a farm in California. The event is witnessed by Haystack and his sister Emerald (Keke Palmer), but the UFO is destroyed by a rival farmer, O.J. Hayward (David S. Lee). The incident has a profound impact on Haystack and Emerald, who are left to deal with the trauma of their past.\n\nDecades later, Haystack is working on a horse ranch in the same area, while Emerald is a rodeo performer. They are reunited when a strange and terrifying event occurs at the ranch, which is soon revealed to be connected to the UFO that was seen in the past.

Kurata's designs for the film are a key part of the story, and help to create a sense of time and place.\n\n### Sound design\n\nThe sound design for Nope was handled by Steve Cantamessa, who is known for his work on films such as The Revenant and Arrival. Cantamessa's work on the film's sound design helped to create a sense of tension and unease, and added to the overall sense of realism.\n\n### Music\n\nThe music for Nope was composed by Michael Abels, who is known for his work on films such as Get Out and Us.

Born Anna Mae Bullock on November 26, 1939, in Nutbush, Tennessee, she rose to fame in the 1960s as the frontwoman of the music duo Ike & Tina Turner, and later achieved even greater success as a solo artist. With a career spanning over six decades, Turner has become one of the most successful and influential musicians of all time, with a record 12 Grammy Awards and induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\n**#Early Life**\n\nTurner's early life was marked by poverty and hardship. Born in Nutbush, a small town in Tennessee, she was the second of three children to Richard and Zelma Bullock. Her father was a sharecropper and a Baptist minister, who taught Turner how to sing in the church choir. After her parents divorced when Turner was just a child, she and her siblings moved to Knoxville, Tennessee, to live with their mother. Turner's early exposure to music was largely influenced by gospel music, but she was also drawn to the blues and rhythm and blues of the 1950s.\n\n**#Ike and Tina Turner**\n\n###**Origins: 1956–1960**\n\nTurner's music career began in the late 1950s when she met Ike Turner, a musician and bandleader from Mississippi. Turner was just 16 years old and a gospel singer at the time. Ike, who was 20 years her senior, was impressed by her powerful voice and invited her to join his band, the Kings of Rhythm. The two began a romantic relationship, and Turner eventually became the lead singer of the band.\n\n###**Early success: 1960–1965**\n\nThe duo, known as Ike & Tina Turner, achieved early success in the early 1960s, with hits like \"A Fool in Love\" and \"It's Gonna Work Out Fine.\" Their music was a unique blend of blues, gospel, and rock and roll, which appealed to a wide audience. Turner's stage presence and energetic performances also helped to establish the duo as a must-see act.\n\n###**Mainstream success: 1966–1975**\n\nThe late 1960s and early 1970s saw the duo achieve mainstream success with hits like \"River Deep – Mountain High\" and \"Proud Mary.\" Turner's voice was now fully established as one of the most powerful and distinctive in music, and her performances were becoming increasingly energetic and dynamic. The duo's music was also becoming more polished and sophisticated, with a greater emphasis on songwriting and production.\n\n###**Split: 1976**\n\nThe duo's success was not without its challenges, however. Turner's relationship with Ike was becoming increasingly strained, and the two eventually divorced in 1976. Turner also filed a lawsuit against Ike, alleging physical and emotional abuse. The lawsuit was eventually settled out of court, but it marked the end of the duo's time together.\n\n**#Solo Career**\n\n###**Early solo career: 1976–1982**\n\nAfter her split from Ike, Turner began to establish a solo career, releasing her debut album \"Tina Turns the Country On!\" in 1974. The album was a commercial success, but it was her follow-up album \"Rough\" in 1978 that really marked a turning point in her solo career. The album's soulful, bluesy sound and Turner's heartfelt performances earned her critical acclaim and a new audience.\n\n###**Career resurgence and superstardom: 1983–2000**\n\nThe 1980s saw Turner's solo career truly take off, with the release of her album \"Private Dancer\" in 1984. The album was a massive commercial success, with hits like \"What's Love Got to Do with It\" and \"Better Be Good to Me.\" Turner's performances were now more energetic and dynamic than ever, and her music was becoming increasingly polished and sophisticated.\n\n###**Later career: 2001–2021**\n\nThe 2000s saw Turner continue to release successful albums, including \"Twenty Four Seven\" in 1999 and \"All the Best\" in 2004. Her live performances were also becoming increasingly popular, with her joining forces with other artists like Beyoncé and Lady Gaga. Turner's music was also beginning to take on a more nostalgic tone, with her revisiting her blues and soul roots.\n\n**#Personal Life**\n\n###**Relationships and marriages**\n\nTurner's personal life has been the subject of much media attention over the years. She has been married twice, first to Ike Turner in 1962 and then to Erwin Bach, a German music executive, in 2013. Her relationship with Ike was marked by physical and emotional abuse, and she eventually left him in 1976. Turner has also been open about her struggles with addiction and her experiences with domestic violence.\n\n###**Children**\n\nTurner does not have any children of her own, but she has been a mentor and role model to many young artists over the years. She has also been involved in various charitable organizations, including the Make-A-Wish Foundation and the Starkey Hearing Foundation.\n\n###**Religious beliefs**\n\nTurner has been open about her Christian faith, which has played an important role in her life and music. She has also been involved in various charitable organizations and has used her platform to raise awareness for social justice issues.\n\n###**Residences, citizenship, and wealth**\n\nTurner has been a resident of Switzerland since 1994 and has dual citizenship of the United States and Switzerland. She has also been one of the wealthiest musicians in the world, with an estimated net worth of over $250 million.\n\n**#Illness and Death**\n\nTurner has been open about her struggles with various health issues over the years, including colon cancer and kidney disease. She has undergone several surgeries and has been hospitalized on several occasions. However, she continues to tour and perform to this day.\n\n**#Musical Legacy and Accolades**\n\nTurner's musical legacy is one of the most impressive in history. She has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the Grammy Hall of Fame, and the Songwriters Hall of Fame. She has also won 12 Grammy Awards, including Record of the Year for \"What's Love Got to Do with It.\" Her music has been covered by countless artists, and she continues to inspire new generations of musicians and fans around the world.\n\n**#Discography**\n\n###**Studio albums**\n\n* Tina Turns the Country On!

This movement draws on the principles of the Reformation and the fundamentalist movement, emphasizing the authority and inerrancy of the Bible. Reformed Fundamentalism has its roots in the United States and has had a significant impact on American evangelicalism.\n\n# History and Main Leaders\n\nReformed Fundamentalism has its origins in the 1920s and 1930s, when conservative evangelicals began to respond to the perceived liberalization of mainline Protestant denominations. Key leaders of this movement included Carl McIntire, who founded the Bible Presbyterian Church, and J. Gresham Machen, who was a prominent Presbyterian theologian and pastor. Other influential figures included John R. Rice, a Baptist evangelist, and R. J. Rushdoony, a theologian and pastor who played a significant role in shaping Reformed Fundamentalist thought.\n\n# Theological Distinctives\n\nReformed Fundamentalism is characterized by a number of distinctive theological emphases. While there is no single, unified theology that defines this movement, the following are some of the key features:\n\n## Broader Conservative Evangelicalism\n\nReformed Fundamentalism is part of a broader conservative evangelical movement that emphasizes the authority and inerrancy of the Bible. This movement is characterized by a commitment to the gospel of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ, the importance of personal conversion, and the role of the Bible as the ultimate authority for Christian faith and practice.\n\n### Pertaining to Salvation and the Gospel\n\nReformed Fundamentalists emphasize the importance of the gospel of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ. They believe that sinners are saved by faith alone, apart from works, and that this faith is a gift of God's grace. They also emphasize the importance of evangelism and personal conversion, seeing these as essential components of a Christian life.\n\n### Other Fundamental Protestant and Biblical Theology\n\nIn addition to their emphasis on the gospel, Reformed Fundamentalists also emphasize the importance of other fundamental Protestant and biblical theological principles. These include the authority of the Bible as the ultimate source of Christian doctrine, the importance of the Trinity, and the role of the church as a community of believers.\n\n## The Inspiration and Preservation of the Scriptures\n\nReformed Fundamentalists emphasize the inspiration and preservation of the Scriptures, seeing these as essential components of a biblical worldview.\n\n### Verbal Plenary Inspiration\n\nReformed Fundamentalists believe in verbal plenary inspiration, which holds that the entire Bible, in its original autographs, is fully and infallibly inspired by God. This means that the Bible is seen as the inspired word of God, rather than simply a human document.\n\n### Preservation of the Texts of Scripture\n\nIn addition to emphasizing the inspiration of the Bible, Reformed Fundamentalists also emphasize the preservation of the texts of Scripture. They believe that the Bible has been preserved through the centuries, and that the original autographs have been accurately transmitted to us today.\n\n## Common Principles of Reformation Evangelical Interpretation and Private Reading\n\nReformed Fundamentalists emphasize the importance of common principles of Reformation evangelical interpretation and private reading. These include the importance of reading the Bible in its historical and cultural context, and the role of the Holy Spirit in guiding the reader's understanding of Scripture.\n\n## The Classical Creeds and Reformational Confessions\n\nReformed Fundamentalists also emphasize the importance of the classical creeds and Reformational confessions. These include the Apostles' Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Westminster Confession of Faith, which are seen as authoritative statements of Christian doctrine.\n\n# Congregational Practices\n\nReformed Fundamentalists place a high value on congregational practices, seeing these as essential components of a Christian life. These include the importance of church membership, the sacraments, and the role of the local church in evangelism and discipleship.\n\n# Bible Translation and Usage\n\nReformed Fundamentalists have a distinctive view of Bible translation and usage, emphasizing the importance of accurate and faithful translations of the original text.\n\n## The Authorised Version Tradition, the Byzantine Received Text, and Eastern (Greek) and Western (Greco-Latin) Ecclesiastical Translation Traditions\n\nReformed Fundamentalists place a high value on the Authorized Version (KJV), which is seen as a faithful translation of the original text. They also emphasize the importance of the Byzantine Received Text, which is seen as the most reliable text of the New Testament.\n\n## Modern Versions, Denominational Preferences and Translation Controversies\n\nIn addition to their emphasis on the Authorized Version, Reformed Fundamentalists also emphasize the importance of modern versions, such as the NASB and the ESV. However, they also express concerns about the accuracy and faithfulness of some modern translations, particularly in the areas of textual criticism and translation methodology.\n\n# Evangelical and Missional Apologetics\n\nReformed Fundamentalists place a high value on evangelical and missional apologetics, seeing these as essential components of a Christian life.\n\n## Bible Apologetics\n\nReformed Fundamentalists emphasize the importance of Bible apologetics, seeing the Bible as the ultimate source of authority for Christian doctrine and practice. They also emphasize the importance of defending the faith against attacks from outside, and of presenting a clear and compelling case for the gospel to a lost world.\n\n# Liberal-Modernist Challenge to Verbal Inspiration and Truthfulness of Scripture\n\nReformed Fundamentalists have historically been concerned with the liberal-modernist challenge to verbal inspiration and the truthfulness of Scripture. This challenge has taken various forms, including the denial of the inerrancy of the Bible and the rejection of the authority of the Bible as the ultimate source of Christian doctrine.\n\n# Modern Biblical Criticism\n\nReformed Fundamentalists have also been concerned with modern biblical criticism, which has sought to challenge traditional views of the Bible and its authority. This has included the use of historical-critical methods to interpret the Bible, and the rejection of traditional views of biblical inspiration and inerrancy.\n\n# Modern Western Society and Intellectual Unbelief\n\nReformed Fundamentalists have been concerned with the impact of modern Western society and intellectual unbelief on Christian faith and practice. This has included the rise of secularism and the decline of traditional Christian values, as well as the influence of evolutionary theory and other forms of intellectual unbelief.\n\n## Criticism of New-Neo Evangelicalism and the 'Present Downgrade'\n\nReformed Fundamentalists have criticized what they see as the liberalization of evangelicalism, particularly in the areas of theology and practice. This has included the rise of New-Evangelicalism and the perceived \"downgrade\" of Christian doctrine and practice.\n\n## Materialist and Naturalist Unbelief, and Historic Adamism and Creationism\n\nReformed Fundamentalists have also been concerned with the rise of materialist and naturalist unbelief, which they see as a threat to Christian faith and practice. This has included the rejection of creationism and the acceptance of evolutionary theory, as well as the influence of other forms of intellectual unbelief.\n\n# See Also\n\n* Conservative Evangelicalism\n* Fundamentalism\n* Bible Presbyterian Church\n* J.

With a population of over 84 million people, Turkey is the world's 18th most populous country.\n\n**#Etymology**\n\nThe name \"Turkey\" is derived from the Middle English term \"Turke,\" which referred to the Turkic peoples, a group of ethnic groups that originated from Central Asia and migrated to Anatolia in the 11th century.
