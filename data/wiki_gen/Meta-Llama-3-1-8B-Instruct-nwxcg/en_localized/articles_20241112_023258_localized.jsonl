The club competes in the Ovens and Murray Football League (OMFL) and has a rich history dating back to 1877.\n\n**Club History**\n\nThe Wangaratta Football Club was founded in 1877, making it one of the oldest football clubs in Australia. The club's early years were marked by a series of mergers and name changes, with the club being known as the Wangaratta Cricket and Football Club from 1877 to 1880. In 1880, the club separated into two distinct entities, with the cricket team becoming the Wangaratta Cricket Club and the football team becoming the Wangaratta Football Club.\n\nThe club's early success was marked by a series of premierships in the Ovens and Murray Football League, with the club winning its first premiership in 1883. The club's success continued throughout the early 20th century, with the club winning several more premierships in the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nIn the mid-20th century, the club underwent a period of decline, finishing last in the OMFL in 1955. However, the club's fortunes turned around in the 1960s, with the club winning several premierships and finishing second in the OMFL in 1965.\n\nIn recent years, the club has continued to compete at a high level, finishing third in the OMFL in 2015 and fourth in 2018. The club has also been involved in several notable matches, including a 2019 match against the Ovens and Murray Football League's under 19 representative team.\n\n**Football Competition Timeline**\n\nThe following is a list of the Wangaratta Football Club's participation in various football competitions:\n\n* 1877-1880: Wangaratta Cricket and Football Club\n* 1880-1955: Wangaratta Football Club (Ovens and Murray Football League)\n* 1956-1965: Wangaratta Football Club (Ovens and Murray Football League)\n* 1966-1975: Wangaratta Football Club (Ovens and Murray Football League)\n* 1976-1985: Wangaratta Football Club (Ovens and Murray Football League)\n* 1986-1995: Wangaratta Football Club (Ovens and Murray Football League)\n* 1996-2005: Wangaratta Football Club (Ovens and Murray Football League)\n* 2006-2015: Wangaratta Football Club (Ovens and Murray Football League)\n* 2016-present: Wangaratta Football Club (Ovens and Murray Football League)\n\n**Football Premierships**\n\nThe Wangaratta Football Club has won several premierships throughout its history.

However, in recent years, the country has taken steps towards greater integration with the Western world, including accession to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). This article will provide an overview of Finland's relations with NATO, from the country's post-war neutrality to its current membership.\n\n##Background: Finnish neutrality at the end of World War II\n\nFinland declared its independence from Russia in 1917, and during World War II, the country was invaded by the Soviet Union. The Continuation War (1939-1944) saw Finland fighting against the Soviet Union, but the country ultimately had to cede significant territory to the Soviets. After the war, Finland adopted a policy of neutrality, aiming to avoid involvement in future conflicts.\n\n##1949–2023: Pre-membership relations\n\n###1949–1991: Finnish neutrality during the Cold War\n\nDuring the Cold War, Finland maintained its neutrality, avoiding membership in military alliances and instead focusing on economic cooperation with Western countries. The country joined the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) in 1961 and the European Economic Community's (EEC) predecessor, the European Economic Area (EEA), in 1973. Finland's neutrality was also reflected in its foreign policy, which emphasized cooperation with the Soviet Union and other Eastern European countries.\n\n###1991–1995: Immediate aftermath of the Cold War\n\nThe collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 marked a significant turning point in Finland's foreign policy. The country quickly established diplomatic relations with the newly independent Baltic states and began to reorient its foreign policy towards the West. In 1992, Finland joined the European Union (EU), which marked a significant shift towards greater integration with the European community.\n\n###1995–2022: Shift from non-alignment within the European Union\n\nFinland's membership in the EU led to a significant shift in its foreign policy, with the country increasingly aligning itself with Western powers. In 1995, Finland joined the Schengen Agreement, which allowed for the free movement of people between EU countries. The country also participated in EU peacekeeping missions and provided military support to international organizations.\n\n###2022–2023: Accession process following the Russian invasion of Ukraine\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 marked a significant turning point in Finland's foreign policy. The country quickly condemned the invasion and provided humanitarian aid to Ukraine. In May 2022, Finland's parliament passed a resolution declaring the country's intention to apply for NATO membership. The application was submitted in June 2022, and the accession process began in earnest.\n\n####February – May 2022: Initial response to the invasion\n\nFinland's initial response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine was swift and decisive. The country provided humanitarian aid to Ukraine and condemned the invasion in strong terms. Finland's parliament also passed a resolution calling for NATO membership, which marked a significant shift in the country's foreign policy.\n\n####May – June 2022: Declaration of intent, application\n\nIn May 2022, Finland's parliament passed a resolution declaring the country's intention to apply for NATO membership. The application was submitted in June 2022, and the accession process began in earnest. The country's decision to join NATO was seen as a significant shift in its foreign policy, with the country aligning itself with Western powers.\n\n####June 2022 – April 2023: Ratification\n\nThe ratification process for Finland's NATO membership began in June 2022 and was completed in April 2023. The process involved the approval of Finland's parliament and the signing of a membership agreement with NATO. The accession was seen as a significant achievement for Finland, marking a major shift in the country's foreign policy.\n\n##2023–present: Finnish membership in NATO\n\nFinland's membership in NATO was finalized in April 2023, with the country officially becoming a member of the alliance. The membership marked a significant shift in Finland's foreign policy, with the country aligning itself with Western powers. Finland's membership in NATO is seen as a key component of the country's security policy, providing a collective defense against potential threats.\n\nFinland's foreign relations with other NATO member states\n\nFinland's membership in NATO has also led to increased cooperation with other NATO member states. The country has established close ties with the United States, the United Kingdom, and other European countries. Finland has also participated in NATO's peacekeeping missions and provided military support to international organizations.\n\nSee also\n\n* Finland–EU relations\n* Finland–Russia relations\n* Finland–United States relations\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\n* Nordic Council of Ministers.

These actions aim to decrease greenhouse gas emissions, slow down the rate of global warming, and prevent the worst impacts of climate change. Climate change mitigation is a crucial aspect of addressing the climate crisis, as it seeks to reduce the risks associated with climate change and promote a more sustainable future.\n\n**Definitions and Scope**\n\nClimate change mitigation encompasses a wide range of activities, including reducing emissions from energy production and use, land use changes, and industrial processes. It involves transitioning to low-carbon energy sources, increasing energy efficiency, and preserving and enhancing carbon sinks such as forests, soils, and wetlands. Mitigation also includes reducing deforestation, promoting sustainable land use practices, and implementing policies to reduce emissions.\n\n**Relationship with Solar Radiation Modification (SRM)**\n\nSolar radiation modification (SRM) refers to techniques that aim to reduce the amount of solar radiation that reaches the Earth's surface, thereby cooling the planet. SRM methods include injecting aerosols into the stratosphere, injecting sulfates into the stratosphere, and using mirrors or other reflective materials to deflect solar radiation. While SRM can provide a temporary cooling effect, its long-term effectiveness and potential unintended consequences are still unclear. Climate change mitigation and SRM can be complementary, but they are distinct approaches to addressing the climate crisis.\n\n**Emission Trends and Pledges**\n\nGlobal greenhouse gas emissions have continued to rise over the past few decades, despite increasing efforts to reduce them. The most recent data available shows that global emissions have increased by over 50% since 1990. To mitigate climate change, emissions must be reduced significantly, and this requires a coordinated effort from governments, businesses, and individuals.\n\n**Needed Emissions Cuts**\n\nTo avoid the worst impacts of climate change, global emissions must be reduced by at least 45% by 2030, and by 100% by 2050. This requires a rapid transition to low-carbon energy sources, increased energy efficiency, and reduced energy consumption. Achieving this goal will require significant changes to energy production and use, transportation, industry, and land use.\n\n**Pledges**\n\nIn 2015, nearly 200 countries agreed to the Paris Agreement, which aims to limit global warming to well below 2°C and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. The agreement includes a goal to reduce global emissions by at least 45% by 2030, compared to 2010 levels. Many countries have made pledges to reduce their emissions, but these pledges are not yet sufficient to achieve the goal of limiting warming to 1.5°C.\n\n**Low-Carbon Energy**\n\nLow-carbon energy sources, such as solar, wind, hydro, and nuclear power, are essential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. These sources can provide energy without emitting greenhouse gases, and they can be scaled up rapidly to meet growing energy demand.\n\n**Solar and Wind Energy**\n\nSolar energy has become increasingly cost-competitive with fossil fuels in recent years, and it is now the cheapest source of electricity in many parts of the world. Wind energy is another rapidly growing source of low-carbon energy, and it can provide electricity at a cost competitive with fossil fuels.\n\n**Other Renewables**\n\nOther renewable energy sources, such as hydro, geothermal, and tidal power, are also becoming increasingly important. These sources can provide energy without emitting greenhouse gases, and they can be used to power transportation, industry, and homes.\n\n**Integrating Variable Renewable Energy**\n\nVariable renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, can provide electricity, but they cannot provide baseload power. Integrating these sources into the grid requires advanced technologies, such as energy storage and smart grids, to ensure a reliable and efficient energy supply.\n\n**Nuclear Power**\n\nNuclear power can provide low-carbon energy, but it also poses significant risks, including nuclear accidents and the management of radioactive waste. Nuclear power plants can provide baseload power, but they are becoming increasingly expensive, and their role in the energy mix is declining.\n\n**Replacing Coal with Natural Gas**\n\nNatural gas is often touted as a cleaner alternative to coal, but it still emits significant amounts of greenhouse gases, primarily methane. Replacing coal with natural gas can reduce emissions, but it does not address the root causes of climate change.\n\n**Demand Reduction**\n\nReducing energy demand is essential for mitigating climate change, as it reduces the amount of energy that needs to be produced from fossil fuels. Demand reduction can be achieved through energy conservation and efficiency, lifestyle changes, and dietary changes.\n\n**Energy Conservation and Efficiency**\n\nEnergy conservation and efficiency can reduce energy demand by improving the efficiency of buildings, appliances, and transportation. This can be achieved through simple measures, such as turning off lights and electronics when not in use, and through more complex measures, such as upgrading to energy-efficient appliances and buildings.\n\n**Lifestyle Changes**\n\nLifestyle changes, such as reducing air travel and meat consumption, can also reduce energy demand. These changes can have significant impacts, but they require individual effort and collective action.\n\n**Dietary Change**\n\nDietary change can reduce energy demand by reducing the amount of energy required to produce and transport food. A plant-based diet, for example, can reduce energy demand by up to 50%.\n\n**Family Size**\n\nReducing family size can also reduce energy demand, as it reduces the number of people consuming energy. This can be achieved through family planning and education.\n\n**Preserving and Enhancing Carbon Sinks**\n\nCarbon sinks, such as forests, soils, and wetlands, can absorb and store carbon dioxide, reducing the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Preserving and enhancing these sinks can help mitigate climate change.\n\n**Forests**\n\nForests are the largest carbon sink on land, and they play a crucial role in regulating the climate. Preserving and expanding forests can help reduce emissions and store carbon dioxide.\n\n**Conservation**\n\nForest conservation efforts can help preserve existing forests and prevent deforestation. This can be achieved through protected areas, sustainable forest management, and community-led forest conservation.\n\n**Afforestation and Reforestation**\n\nAfforestation and reforestation can restore degraded forests and expand forest cover. This can be achieved through planting trees, restoring degraded lands, and promoting sustainable forest management.\n\n**Soils**\n\nSoils can also act as carbon sinks, storing carbon dioxide through processes such as soil carbon sequestration. Preserving and enhancing soil health can help reduce emissions and promote sustainable agriculture.\n\n**Wetlands**\n\nWetlands, such as mangroves and salt marshes, can also act as carbon sinks, storing carbon dioxide through processes such as soil carbon sequestration. Preserving and enhancing wetland health can help reduce emissions and promote sustainable land use.\n\n**Deep Ocean**\n\nThe deep ocean can also act as a carbon sink, storing carbon dioxide through processes such as ocean acidification. Preserving and enhancing ocean health can help reduce emissions and promote sustainable ocean use.\n\n**Enhanced Weathering**\n\nEnhanced weathering can also help reduce emissions by accelerating the conversion of carbon dioxide into stable minerals. This can be achieved through technologies such as weathering rocks or minerals.\n\n**Other Methods to Capture and Store CO2**\n\nOther methods to capture and store CO2 include carbon capture and storage (CCS), bio-energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), and direct air capture (DAC). These methods can reduce emissions from industrial sources, but they are still in the early stages of development and deployment.\n\n**Mitigation by Sector**\n\nClimate change mitigation efforts can be applied to various sectors, including buildings, transportation, industry, and agriculture.\n\n**Buildings**\n\nBuildings can be made more energy-efficient through insulation, windows, and building materials.

The grade system is a way to standardize the level of difficulty of a climb, allowing climbers to compare and evaluate routes. Various grade systems have been developed over time, each with its own unique characteristics and terminology.\n\n**History**\n\nThe first grade system was introduced in the early 20th century by the French Alpine Club. The French system, also known as the French numerical grade, was initially based on a numerical scale, with higher numbers indicating greater difficulty. However, the system was later modified to include a letter-based system, with grades labeled from 1 to 9, with 1 being the easiest and 9 being the most difficult.\n\n**Free climbing**\n\nFree climbing is a type of climbing that involves ascending a route without the use of any equipment or assistance, such as ropes, harnesses, or carabiners. Free climbing grades are used to describe the difficulty of a route, taking into account factors such as the physical demands of the climb, the level of technique required, and the risk of falling.\n\n### French numerical grade\n\nThe French numerical grade system is one of the most widely used and respected grading systems in the world. The system uses a number-based scale, with grades ranging from 1 to 9. The French grade system is based on the difficulty of the climb, with higher numbers indicating greater difficulty.\n\n* Grade 1: Easy, straightforward climb with minimal obstacles.\n* Grade 2: Moderate climb with some obstacles and challenges.\n* Grade 3: Difficult climb with complex sequences and technical moves.\n* Grade 4: Very difficult climb with high-level technical moves and risk.\n* Grade 5: Extremely difficult climb with high-level technical moves and significant risk.\n* Grade 6: Extremely difficult climb with high-level technical moves and extreme risk.\n* Grade 7: Extremely difficult climb with high-level technical moves and extreme risk.\n* Grade 8: Extremely difficult climb with high-level technical moves and extreme risk.\n* Grade 9: Extremely difficult climb with high-level technical moves and extreme risk.\n\n### American YDS grade\n\nThe American YDS (Yosemite Decimal System) grade system is used primarily in the United States. The YDS system uses a letter-based scale, with grades ranging from 5.0 to 5.15. The YDS system is based on the difficulty of the climb, with higher letters indicating greater difficulty.\n\n* Grade 5.0: Class 3 climb, with scrambling and some exposure.\n* Grade 5.1-5.2: Class 3-4 climb, with scrambling and some exposure.\n* Grade 5.3-5.4: Class 4-5 climb, with scrambling and some exposure.\n* Grade 5.5-5.6: Class 5 climb, with technical moves and exposure.\n* Grade 5.7-5.8: Class 5-6 climb, with technical moves and exposure.\n* Grade 5.9-5.10: Class 6 climb, with technical moves and exposure.\n* Grade 5.11-5.12: Class 6-7 climb, with technical moves and exposure.\n* Grade 5.13-5.14: Class 7 climb, with technical moves and exposure.\n* Grade 5.15: Class 7 climb, with technical moves and extreme exposure.\n\n### UIAA scale\n\nThe UIAA (Union of International Alpine Associations) scale is used primarily in Europe.

He was a prominent figure in the development of natural history museums in Australia and played a key role in the introduction of Darwinian theory to the country. Krefft was a prolific writer and artist, and his work continues to be important in the fields of natural history and museum studies.\n\n**Family**\n\nGerard Krefft was born on September 13, 1830, in Ostheim, Bavaria, Germany. His father was a Lutheran minister, and Krefft was the oldest of four children. Little is known about Krefft's early life, but it is believed that he received a classical education, studying Latin, Greek, and philosophy.\n\n**Education**\n\nKrefft's early education laid the foundation for his future career as a naturalist. He was particularly interested in the natural sciences and spent much of his free time studying and collecting specimens. In 1850, Krefft traveled to Europe, where he spent several years studying natural history at the universities of Munich and Berlin.\n\n**Marriage**\n\nIn 1852, Krefft married a woman named Emma, and the couple had two children together. Emma was an Englishwoman, and the couple met while Krefft was working in Melbourne. The marriage was a happy one, and Emma proved to be a supportive partner, often accompanying Krefft on his expeditions.\n\n**German Heritage**\n\nKrefft's German heritage had a significant impact on his work as a naturalist. He was deeply influenced by the scientific traditions of his homeland and was particularly interested in the work of German naturalists such as Alexander von Humboldt. Krefft's own work was characterized by a strong emphasis on observation and the collection of data, which was a hallmark of German scientific methodology.\n\n**\"Natural History\"**\n\nKrefft's work as a naturalist was focused on the study of the natural world. He was particularly interested in the study of Australian fauna and spent much of his career collecting and classifying specimens. Krefft's work in this area was groundbreaking, and he made several significant discoveries, including the description of several new species of fish and reptiles.\n\n**\"Darwinian doctrine\" and the consequent \"Darwinian controversy\"**\n\nKrefft was a strong supporter of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection. He was one of the first Australians to accept the theory, and he played a key role in popularizing it in the country. However, Krefft's support for Darwinism was not without controversy. The theory was widely opposed by many scientists and theologians, who saw it as a threat to traditional views of creation and the natural world.\n\n**Evolution**\n\nKrefft's understanding of evolution was shaped by his reading of Darwin's work. He saw evolution as a gradual process, driven by the struggle for existence and the survival of the fittest. Krefft believed that evolution was a fundamental principle of the natural world, and he saw it as a key to understanding the diversity of life on Earth.\n\n**Natural Selection**\n\nKrefft was a strong believer in the power of natural selection to shape the evolution of species. He saw natural selection as a key driver of evolutionary change, and he believed that it was responsible for the development of many of the complex adaptations found in living organisms.\n\n**Ellegård's five \"positions\" held by scientists in the Darwinian controversy**\n\nKrefft's position on Darwinism was one of enthusiastic support. He was a strong advocate for the theory, and he saw it as a key to understanding the natural world. However, not all scientists who dealt with evolution shared Krefft's views. In his book \"Darwin and the General Reader in Victorian England,\" Arnold Ellegård identified five different positions that scientists held on the issue of evolution. These positions were:\n\n1. The acceptance of evolution as a scientific fact\n2. The acceptance of evolution as a scientific theory, but with reservations\n3. The rejection of evolution as a scientific theory, but with reservations\n4. The rejection of evolution as a scientific theory\n5. The rejection of evolution as a scientific theory and the acceptance of creationism\n\nKrefft's position on Darwinism would fall into the first category, as he accepted evolution as a scientific fact.\n\n**Artist**\n\nIn addition to his work as a naturalist, Krefft was also a skilled artist. He was particularly interested in the study of Australian wildlife, and he spent much of his career painting and drawing animals. Krefft's artwork was highly regarded, and he was one of the first Australians to make a name for himself as a wildlife artist.\n\n**Victoria (1852 – 1858)**\n\nKrefft's work in Victoria was highly productive. He spent several years working in the state, collecting and classifying specimens and promoting the study of natural history. During this time, Krefft also worked as a curator at the Museum of Natural History in Melbourne.\n\n**Melbourne**\n\nKrefft's time in Melbourne was marked by several significant events. In 1853, he was appointed as the curator of the Museum of Natural History, and he spent several years working to develop the museum's collections. Krefft's work in this area was highly regarded, and he was seen as a driving force behind the development of the museum.\n\n**Blandowski, the Museum of Natural History, and Professor McCoy**\n\nKrefft's work at the Museum of Natural History was also marked by controversy. In 1857, the museum's curator, George Blandowski, was removed from his position, and Krefft was appointed as his replacement. However, Krefft's tenure as curator was short-lived, as he was dismissed from his position in 1858.\n\n**Germany**\n\nKrefft's experiences in Germany had a significant impact on his work as a naturalist. He was influenced by the scientific traditions of his homeland, and he was particularly interested in the work of German naturalists such as Alexander von Humboldt. Krefft's own work was characterized by a strong emphasis on observation and the collection of data, which was a hallmark of German scientific methodology.\n\n**Natural historian, museum curator and administrator**\n\nKrefft's work as a natural historian was focused on the study of the natural world. He was particularly interested in the study of Australian fauna and spent much of his career collecting and classifying specimens. Krefft's work in this area was groundbreaking, and he made several significant discoveries, including the description of several new species of fish and reptiles.\n\n**Darwinism**\n\nKrefft's support for Darwinism was a key aspect of his work as a naturalist. He was one of the first Australians to accept the theory, and he played a key role in popularizing it in the country. However, Krefft's support for Darwinism was not without controversy. The theory was widely opposed by many scientists and theologians, who saw it as a threat to traditional views of creation and the natural world.\n\n**\"The New Museum Idea\"**\n\nKrefft's work as a curator and administrator was also marked by innovation. In 1860, he was appointed as the curator of the Queensland Museum, and he spent several years working to develop the museum's collections. Krefft's work in this area was highly regarded, and he was seen as a driving force behind the development of the museum.\n\n**Cabinets of curiosities**\n\nKrefft's work as a curator was also marked by a focus on the development of cabinets of curiosities. He saw these collections as a way to showcase the natural world and to promote the study of natural history. Krefft's work in this area was highly regarded, and he was seen as a leading figure in the development of cabinets of curiosities.\n\n**Public museums**\n\nKrefft's work as a curator and administrator was also marked by a focus on the development of public museums. He saw these institutions as a way to promote the study of natural history and to provide a resource for the public. Krefft's work in this area was highly regarded, and he was seen as a leading figure in the development of public museums.\n\n**The \"new museum\"**\n\nKrefft's work as a curator and administrator was also marked by innovation. In 1860, he was appointed as the curator of the Queensland Museum, and he spent several years working to develop the museum's collections. Krefft's work in this area was highly regarded, and he was seen as a driving force behind the development of the museum.\n\n**Krefft's curatorial rationale**\n\nKrefft's approach to curating was highly regarded, and he was seen as a leading figure in the development of museum collections. His rationale for curating was based on a strong emphasis on observation and the collection of data. Krefft believed that the collection of specimens and artifacts was a key aspect of the curatorial process, and he spent much of his career developing the collections of the Queensland Museum.\n\n**Lack of funding**\n\nDespite Krefft's many achievements, his tenure as curator was marked by controversy. The Queensland Museum was underfunded, and Krefft struggled to maintain the institution's collections. In 1867, the museum was forced to close due to a lack of funding, and Krefft was dismissed from his position.\n\n**Photography**\n\nKrefft was also interested in the emerging field of photography. He saw photography as a way to document the natural world and to promote the study of natural history. Krefft's work in this area was highly regarded, and he was seen as a leading figure in the development of photography in Australia.\n\n**Queensland lungfish (Neoceratodus forsteri)**\n\nKrefft's work as a naturalist was also marked by a focus on the study of Australian fauna. He was particularly interested in the study of fish, and he spent much of his career collecting and classifying specimens. Krefft's work in this area was groundbreaking, and he made several significant discoveries, including the description of the Queensland lungfish.\n\n**Louis Agassiz and the Chimaera**\n\nKrefft's work as a naturalist was also marked by a focus on the study of Australian fauna.

The test, which was conducted on December 9, 2020, marked a significant milestone in the development of the Starship program. The flight test aimed to demonstrate the aerodynamic capabilities and reusable design of the Starship, with a focus on landing the spacecraft back on Earth.\n\n**Background**\n\n### **Starship**\n\nThe Starship is a reusable spacecraft designed by SpaceX to take both people and cargo to the Moon, Mars, and other destinations in the solar system. The spacecraft is being developed to be capable of carrying large payloads and landing safely back on Earth, with the goal of reducing the cost of access to space. The Starship is being built using a combination of traditional and additive manufacturing techniques, and is designed to be highly flexible and adaptable to different mission requirements.\n\n### **Development**\n\nThe development of the Starship began in 2012, with the first prototype, known as the Grasshopper, being tested in 2013. The Grasshopper was a vertical takeoff and landing (VTVL) test vehicle that demonstrated the ability to lift off from a launchpad and return to Earth. Over the next several years, SpaceX continued to develop and test the Starship, with the first full-scale prototype, known as the Starship Mark II, being built in 2019.\n\n### **Opinions before launch**\n\nAs the Starship Flight Test 1 approached, there was significant interest and anticipation among space enthusiasts and industry experts. Many believed that the test would be a crucial milestone in the development of the Starship program, and that its success would pave the way for future missions to Mars and beyond. Others expressed concerns about the safety and feasibility of the test, citing the risks associated with launching a reusable spacecraft into orbit.\n\n### **Test objectives**\n\nThe primary objectives of the Starship Flight Test 1 were to demonstrate the aerodynamic capabilities of the Starship in atmospheric flight, and to test the spacecraft's ability to land safely back on Earth. The test also aimed to gather data on the Starship's performance, stability, and control during ascent and descent.\n\n**Launch**\n\n### **Flight profile**\n\nThe Starship Flight Test 1 was launched from the SpaceX test site in Boca Chica, Texas, on December 9, 2020. The spacecraft reached an altitude of approximately 12.5 kilometers (8 miles) and flew at a speed of about 400 km/h (250 mph). The flight profile was designed to allow the Starship to reach the edge of space, where it would experience the extreme conditions of weightlessness and atmospheric pressure.\n\n### **Flight timeline**\n\nThe flight timeline of the Starship Flight Test 1 was as follows:\n\n* 0:00:00 - Launch from the SpaceX test site in Boca Chica, Texas\n* 0:00:30 - Reach an altitude of approximately 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles)\n* 0:02:00 - Reach an altitude of approximately 5 kilometers (3 miles)\n* 0:04:00 - Reach an altitude of approximately 7.5 kilometers (4.5 miles)\n* 0:06:00 - Reach an altitude of approximately 10 kilometers (6 miles)\n* 0:08:00 - Reach an altitude of approximately 12.5 kilometers (8 miles)\n* 0:09:00 - Max Q (maximum dynamic pressure)\n* 0:10:00 - MECO (main engine cutoff)\n* 0:11:00 - Starship reaches the edge of space\n* 0:12:00 - Starship begins descent\n* 0:14:00 - Starship lands safely back on Earth\n\n### **April 17, 2023 attempt**\n\nOn April 17, 2023, SpaceX conducted a second attempt to launch the Starship, which ended in a failure. The spacecraft experienced a mechanical issue during ascent, resulting in a loss of control and a crash landing.\n\n### **April 20, 2023, 2nd attempt**\n\nOn April 20, 2023, SpaceX conducted a third attempt to launch the Starship, which was successful. The spacecraft reached an altitude of approximately 20 kilometers (12 miles) and flew at a speed of about 600 km/h (373 mph).\n\n**Aftermath**\n\n### **Technical assessments**\n\nThe technical assessments of the Starship Flight Test 1 indicated that the spacecraft performed well during ascent and descent, but experienced some issues with stability and control. The Starship's Raptor engines performed as expected, but the spacecraft's guidance and navigation system required further development.\n\n### **Launch site**\n\nThe launch site for the Starship Flight Test 1 was the SpaceX test site in Boca Chica, Texas. The site, which was specially designed for the development and testing of the Starship, provided a safe and controlled environment for the launch and recovery of the spacecraft.\n\n### **Effects on environment**\n\nThe Starship Flight Test 1 had a minimal impact on the environment, as the spacecraft flew at a relatively low altitude and did not reach orbit. However, the test did generate some noise and disturbance, which was mitigated by the use of noise-reducing technologies and careful planning.\n\n### **FAA investigation**\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) conducted an investigation into the Starship Flight Test 1, which concluded that the test was conducted safely and in compliance with regulatory requirements. The investigation highlighted the importance of continued development and testing of the Starship program, with a focus on ensuring the safety of people and the environment.\n\n**See also**\n\n* SpaceX\n* Starship\n* Boca Chica, Texas\n* Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)\n* Weightlessness\n* Atmospheric pressure\n* Main engine cutoff (MECO)\n* Max Q (maximum dynamic pressure)\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The information in this article is based on publicly available data and may not reflect the most up-to-date information.\n* The Starship Flight Test 1 was a significant milestone in the development of the Starship program, but it is only one part of a larger effort to create a reusable spacecraft capable of taking people and cargo to the Moon, Mars, and other destinations in the solar system.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The election was the fifth national election since the end of the Lebanese Civil War in 1990 and the second since the formation of the current electoral law in 2017. The election was marked by a low voter turnout, with many Lebanese citizens expressing frustration with the country's political and economic situation.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe 2022 Lebanese general election was held amidst a backdrop of significant challenges facing the country. The COVID-19 pandemic had a devastating impact on Lebanon's economy, leading to widespread poverty, unemployment, and a significant decline in living standards. The 2020 Beirut explosion, which occurred on August 4, 2020, further exacerbated the country's economic crisis, leading to a massive influx of refugees and a significant decline in the country's economic output.\n\n**2019–21 protests**\n\nThe 2019–21 Lebanese protests, also known as the October Revolution, were a series of mass protests that took place across Lebanon from October 2019 to January 2021. The protests were sparked by a range of issues, including corruption, poverty, and the country's economic crisis. The protests saw widespread calls for the resignation of the government and the implementation of reforms to address the country's economic and social challenges. However, the protests ultimately failed to achieve their goals, and the government was able to maintain power.\n\n**Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic**\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on Lebanon's economy and society. The pandemic led to widespread lockdowns, travel restrictions, and other measures aimed at slowing the spread of the virus. However, these measures also had a devastating impact on the country's economy, with many businesses forced to close and millions of people left without income. The pandemic also exacerbated existing social and economic challenges in the country, leading to a significant increase in poverty and unemployment.\n\n**Beirut explosion**\n\nThe 2020 Beirut explosion, which occurred on August 4, 2020, was a massive explosion that killed over 200 people and injured thousands more. The explosion was caused by the ignition of a large cache of ammonium nitrate that had been stored in a warehouse in the port of Beirut. The explosion had a devastating impact on the city and the country as a whole, leading to widespread damage and a significant decline in living standards.\n\n**Electorate**\n\nThe Lebanese electorate is made up of over 3.9 million registered voters, who are eligible to vote in the country's parliamentary elections. The electorate is divided into 15 electoral districts, each of which elects a certain number of members of parliament. The electoral system used in Lebanon is a proportional representation system, in which voters elect a list of candidates rather than individual politicians.\n\n**Electoral system**\n\nThe electoral system used in Lebanon is a proportional representation system, in which voters elect a list of candidates rather than individual politicians. The system is designed to ensure that the number of seats won by each party or coalition is proportional to the number of votes they receive.

Originating from the Aberffraw hundred, a cantref in northwest Wales, the dynasty rose to prominence through their strategic alliances, military victories, and effective governance. This article will explore the history of the House of Aberffraw, from their origins to their eventual decline.\n\n# **Aberffraw hundred (cantref)**\n\nThe Aberffraw hundred, also known as Cantref Aberffraw, was a medieval cantref (a subdivision of land) in northwest Wales. It was one of the three cantrefs that made up the kingdom of Gwynedd, along with Arfon and Penllyn. The cantref was situated in the present-day county of Anglesey, and its name is derived from the Old Welsh words \"Aber,\" meaning \"river mouth,\" and \"ffraw,\" possibly referring to the River Ffraw that flows through the area.\n\nThe Aberffraw hundred was an important region during the medieval period, with several notable castles and fortifications, including Aberffraw Castle, which was the seat of the Aberffraw dynasty. The cantref's strategic location made it a key area for trade and communication between the kingdoms of Gwynedd and Powys.\n\n# **Welsh dynasties**\n\nThe Aberffraw dynasty was one of several powerful Welsh dynasties that emerged during the 12th to 15th centuries. These dynasties were characterized by their strong sense of family ties, strategic alliances, and military prowess. The Aberffraws were known for their effective governance and their ability to maintain power through a combination of diplomacy, marriage, and military conquest.\n\n## **Succession**\n\nThe Aberffraw dynasty was known for their complex system of succession, which was based on a combination of primogeniture (the right of the eldest son to inherit the throne) and the principle of \" tanistry\" (where the throne was passed to the most capable or worthy leader). This system allowed the dynasty to maintain power and adapt to changing circumstances, while also preventing the concentration of power in the hands of a single individual.\n\n# **Cambro-Norse era**\n\nThe Aberffraw dynasty rose to prominence during the Cambro-Norse era, a period of significant cultural and linguistic change in Wales. The Cambro-Norse people were a mix of Welsh and Norse warriors and settlers who had arrived in Wales following the Viking invasions of the 9th and 10th centuries. The Aberffraws were able to capitalize on the power vacuum created by the decline of the Viking era and establish themselves as a dominant force in Welsh politics.\n\n# **Power base (Norman invasion)**\n\nThe Aberffraw dynasty's power base was established during the Norman invasion of Wales in the 12th century. The Normans, led by William FitzOsbern, introduced feudalism to Wales and established a system of lordship and vassalage that would shape the country's politics for centuries to come. The Aberffraws were able to adapt to the new system and establish themselves as vassals of the Norman lords, while also maintaining their own power and influence in the region.\n\n## **Aberffraw senior line**\n\nThe Aberffraw senior line was the main branch of the Aberffraw dynasty, which produced several notable leaders, including Rhodri Maelor (known as Rhodri the Great) and Llywelyn the Great. The senior line was characterized by its strong sense of family ties and its ability to maintain power through a combination of diplomacy, marriage, and military conquest.\n\n# **Llys**\n\nThe Aberffraw dynasty was known for their use of the \"llys,\" a type of fortress or stronghold that served as a center of power and government. The llys was typically surrounded by a moat or other defensive features and was often the seat of the local lord or king. The Aberffraws used their llys to maintain control over their territories and to project their power into neighboring regions.\n\n## **Rhosyr**\n\nRhosyr was a key location in the Aberffraw dynasty's power base, serving as a major port and trading center. The town was situated on the mainland opposite the island of Anglesey and was an important hub for trade and commerce between the kingdoms of Gwynedd and Powys. The Aberffraws maintained a strong presence in Rhosyr, using it as a base for their military campaigns and trade expeditions.\n\n## **Aberffraw**\n\nAberffraw was the seat of the Aberffraw dynasty, situated in the heart of the cantref of the same name. The town was an important center of power and government, with several notable castles and fortifications, including Aberffraw Castle, which was the seat of the local lord. The Aberffraws maintained a strong presence in Aberffraw, using it as a base for their military campaigns and trade expeditions.\n\n# **Princes of Wales (de facto)**\n\nThe Aberffraw dynasty was known for their ability to produce powerful and influential leaders who played a significant role in Welsh politics. During the 13th century, the Aberffraws produced several notable princes of Wales, including Llywelyn the Great and his son, Dafydd ap Gruffydd. These princes were able to maintain power and influence through a combination of diplomacy, marriage, and military conquest.\n\n## **Llywelyn the Great**\n\nLlywelyn the Great was a notable prince of Wales and a member of the Aberffraw dynasty. He rose to prominence in the mid-13th century and established himself as a dominant force in Welsh politics. Llywelyn was known for his military campaigns against the English and his efforts to establish a unified Welsh state. He was also a patron of the arts and literature, and his court was renowned for its beauty and elegance.\n\n## **1200s- 1400s**\n\nThe Aberffraw dynasty continued to play a significant role in Welsh politics during the 13th to 15th centuries. The dynasty produced several notable leaders, including Owain Glyndŵr, who led a rebellion against the English in the early 15th century. The Aberffraws were also known for their complex system of succession, which allowed them to maintain power and adapt to changing circumstances.\n\n# **Succession after the dynasty**\n\nThe Aberffraw dynasty eventually declined in the 15th century, with the last known member of the family, Rhys ap Gruffydd, dying in 1390. The legacy of the Aberffraw dynasty continued to shape Welsh politics and culture, however, with several notable families and individuals emerging to take their place.\n\n# **See also**\n\n* Aberffraw Castle\n* Llywelyn the Great\n* Owain Glyndŵr\n* Welsh dynasties\n* Cambro-Norse era\n* Norman invasion of Wales\n\n# **Footnotes**\n\n* None\n\n# **References**\n\n* None\n\n# **Sources**\n\n* The Aberffraw Castle Project\n* The Welsh Government\n* The University of Wales Press\n\n# **Further reading**\n\n* The History of Wales by Sir John Rhys\n* The Principality of Wales by David Williams\n* The Aberffraw Dynasty by R.

Known as the \"Queen of Rock 'n' Roll,\" she is one of the most successful and influential musicians of all time, with a career spanning over six decades. Born Anna Mae Bullock on November 26, 1939, in Nutbush, Tennessee, Turner rose to fame in the 1960s as the lead vocalist of the duo Ike & Tina Turner, and later achieved massive success as a solo artist.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nTurner was born to Lavinia Mae Bullock and Floyd Bullock, a sharecropper. She grew up in a poor family with her parents and younger brother, and attended Nutbush High School. Turner's early life was marked by poverty, racism, and domestic violence, which would later influence her music and persona.\n\n**Ike and Tina Turner**\n\nTurner's music career began in the 1950s when she met Ike Turner, a musician and bandleader, in St. Louis, Missouri. Ike was 20 years older than Turner, and he saw potential in her voice. They began performing together as a duo, with Ike on guitar and Turner on vocals. The couple married in 1962 and formed the Ike & Tina Turner Revue.\n\n### Origins: 1956–1960\n\nTurner's early performances with Ike were marked by her powerful voice and energetic stage presence. The duo gained popularity in the St. Louis area, performing in local clubs and bars. In 1959, they signed a recording contract with Sue Records and released their debut single, \"A Fool in Love.\"\n\n### Early Success: 1960–1965\n\nThe Ike & Tina Turner Revue began to gain national attention in the early 1960s, with hits like \"It's Gonna Work Out Fine\" and \"Poor Fool.\" Turner's unique blend of rock, blues, and R&B styles, combined with her charismatic stage presence, helped the duo gain a loyal following. In 1965, they appeared on the popular TV show \"Shindig!,\" introducing their music to a wider audience.\n\n### Mainstream Success: 1966–1975\n\nThe Ike & Tina Turner Revue's popularity continued to grow in the late 1960s and early 1970s, with hits like \"River Deep – Mountain High\" and \"Proud Mary.\" Turner's performances became more theatrical, incorporating dance, costume changes, and audience participation. The duo's music and style influenced many other artists, including The Rolling Stones and Bruce Springsteen.\n\n### Split: 1976\n\nThe Ike & Tina Turner Revue's success was marred by personal problems, including Ike's increasing control over Turner and her music. In 1976, Turner left Ike and filed for divorce, citing domestic violence and emotional abuse. The split marked the end of the Ike & Tina Turner Revue and began a new chapter in Turner's solo career.\n\n**Solo Career**\n\nTurner's solo career began in the late 1970s, with her debut solo single, \"Viva La Money,\" released in 1978. However, it was her 1984 album \"Private Dancer\" that brought her to the forefront of the music scene.\n\n### Early Solo Career: 1976–1982\n\nTurner's early solo career was marked by struggles with her record label and personal demons. She released several albums, including \"Rough\" and \"Love Explosion,\" but they failed to achieve commercial success. In 1978, Turner released the album \"Simply the Best,\" which included the hit single \"Baby Get It On.\"\n\n### Career Resurgence and Superstardom: 1983–2000\n\nThe release of \"Private Dancer\" in 1984 marked a resurgence in Turner's career, with hits like \"What's Love Got to Do with It\" and \"Better Be Good to Me.\" The album sold over 10 million copies worldwide and established Turner as a solo superstar. She continued to release successful albums, including \"Break Every Rule\" and \"Foreign Affair,\" and embarked on several world tours.\n\n### Later Career: 2001–2021\n\nIn the 2000s, Turner released several more albums, including \"Twenty Four Seven\" and \"All the Best,\" which featured re-recorded versions of her classic hits. She continued to tour and perform, with a farewell concert in 2009. In 2013, Turner announced that she was retiring from touring, but would continue to perform live on rare occasions.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nTurner has been married twice, first to Ike Turner in 1962, and then to Erwin Bach in 2013. She has no biological children, but has been a stepmother to Bach's two children from a previous marriage.\n\n### Relationships and Marriages\n\nTurner's early relationships were marked by struggles with Ike Turner, whom she met in the 1950s. The couple married in 1962, but their relationship was marred by domestic violence and control issues.\n\n### Ike Turner\n\nTurner's marriage to Ike Turner was marked by his increasing control over her music and her life. She eventually left him in 1976, citing emotional and physical abuse.\n\n### Erwin Bach\n\nTurner met Erwin Bach, a German music executive, in 1986. They began a romantic relationship, but did not marry until 2013, when Turner was 73 years old.\n\n### Children\n\nTurner does not have any biological children, but has been a stepmother to Bach's two children from a previous marriage.\n\n### Religious Beliefs\n\nTurner has spoken publicly about her Christian faith, citing its influence on her music and her life.\n\n### Residences, Citizenship, and Wealth\n\nTurner is a citizen of the United States and Switzerland, and has lived in both countries throughout her career. She has a net worth of over $250 million, according to Forbes.\n\n**Illness and Death**\n\nTurner has been open about her struggles with health issues, including colon cancer and chronic pain. In 2021, she underwent surgery to remove a tumor from her abdomen, but was forced to cancel several performances due to her health.\n\n**Musical Legacy and Accolades**\n\nTurner's musical legacy is marked by her unique voice, charismatic stage presence, and influence on many other artists. She has been cited as an inspiration by artists like Beyoncé and Lady Gaga, and has won numerous awards, including eight Grammy Awards.\n\n### Awards, Honors and Achievements\n\n* Eight Grammy Awards\n* Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction in 1991\n* Billboard Music Awards Hall of Fame in 2003\n* American Music Awards of Merit in 1991\n* Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1989\n\n**Discography**\n\nTurner has released 12 studio albums, including:\n\n* \"Tina Turns the Country On!\" (1974)\n* \"Acid Queen\" (1975)\n* \"Rough\" (1978)\n* \"Love Explosion\" (1979)\n* \"Private Dancer\" (1984)\n* \"Break Every Rule\" (1986)\n* \"Foreign Affair\" (1989)\n* \"Wildest Dreams\" (1996)\n* \"Twenty Four Seven\" (1999)\n* \"All the Best\" (2004)\n* \"Tina!\" (2008)\n* \"Love Songs\" (2014)\n\n**Tours**\n\nTurner has embarked on several world tours throughout her career, including:\n\n* \"Tina Turner Revue\" (1960s-1970s)\n* \"Private Dancer Tour\" (1985)\n* \"Break Every Rule Tour\" (1986-1987)\n* \"Foreign Affair Tour\" (1989-1990)\n* \"Wildest Dreams Tour\" (1996-1997)\n* \"Twenty Four Seven Tour\" (1999-2000)\n* \"Tina Turner Live in Concert\" (2005)\n* \"Tina!: 50th Anniversary Tour\" (2008-2009)\n\n**Filmography**\n\nTurner has appeared in several films, including:\n\n* \"The Wiz\" (1978)\n* \"Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome\" (1985)\n* \"What's Love Got to Do with It\" (1993)\n* \"Last Action Hero\" (1993)\n* \"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum\" (1996)\n* \"Tina Turner: The Queen of Rock 'n' Roll\" (2008)\n\n**Books**\n\nTurner has written several books, including:\n\n* \"I, Tina: My Life Story\" (1986)\n* \"What's Love Got to Do with It\" (1993)\n* \"My Love Song to You\" (1996)\n* \"Tina Turner: The Autobiography\" (2018)\n\n**Notes**\n\nTurner's legacy extends far beyond her music, with her influence on fashion, performance, and popular culture.\n\n**References**\n\nBibliography:\n\n* Turner, Tina (1986).

Sonic must face off against this new foe and other enemies to protect the island and its secrets.\n\n##**Another Story**\n\nIn addition to the main storyline, Sonic Frontiers features an alternate narrative, known as \"Another Story.\" This narrative provides additional context and backstory for the game's characters and world. The Another Story mode is accessible from the game's main menu and offers a unique perspective on the game's events.\n\n**Development**\n\n##**Conception**\n\nThe development of Sonic Frontiers began in 2017, when Sega's Sonic Team began brainstorming ideas for a new Sonic game. The team was inspired by the success of other open-world games, such as The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and wanted to create a game that would offer a similar level of freedom and exploration.\n\n##**Design**\n\nThe game's design was led by lead game designer, Shun Nakamura, who emphasized the importance of creating a game that would appeal to both new and old fans of the series. The team drew inspiration from various sources, including classic Sonic games, anime, and manga.\n\n##**Writing**\n\nThe game's story was written by a team of writers, led by veteran writer, Yasushi Yamaguchi. The team aimed to create a narrative that would be both engaging and accessible to players of all ages.\n\n##**Music**\n\nThe game's soundtrack was composed by Tomoya Ohtani, who is known for his work on previous Sonic games. The music is a key element of the game, as it reacts to the player's actions and movements, creating a dynamic and immersive experience.\n\n**Marketing and release**\n\nSonic Frontiers was officially announced in June 2022, with a release date set for November 8, 2022.

It is characterized by a commitment to the principles of the Protestant Reformation, a emphasis on biblical literacy and exegesis, and a rejection of modernist and liberal interpretations of Scripture.\n\n**History and Main Leaders**\n\nReformed fundamentalism has its roots in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when American evangelicals began to react against the rising tide of liberal theology and modernism in the mainline denominations. Key figures in the development of reformed fundamentalism include J. Gresham Machen, a Presbyterian theologian who argued that the Bible is the ultimate authority for Christian doctrine and practice; Carl McIntire, a Baptist minister who founded the American Council of Christian Churches and advocated for a strict separation of church and state; and Cornelius Van Til, a Dutch-American philosopher and theologian who developed a distinctive approach to apologetics and the theological interpretation of Scripture.\n\nOther notable leaders in the reformed fundamentalist movement include James Henley Thornwell, a Presbyterian theologian who argued for the importance of the Westminster Confession of Faith; John Murray, a Presbyterian theologian who emphasized the sovereignty of God and the importance of biblical exegesis; and Gordon Clark, a Presbyterian theologian who developed a distinctive approach to theology and apologetics.\n\n**Theological Distinctives**\n\nReformed fundamentalism is characterized by several distinct theological emphases, including a commitment to the authority of Scripture, a emphasis on personal conversion and regeneration, and a rejection of modernist and liberal interpretations of Scripture.\n\n### **Broader Conservative Evangelicalism**\n\nReformed fundamentalism is part of a broader conservative evangelical movement that emphasizes the importance of biblical authority, personal conversion, and traditional Christian doctrine. This movement is characterized by a commitment to the inerrancy and authority of Scripture, a emphasis on personal evangelism and discipleship, and a rejection of modernist and liberal interpretations of Scripture.\n\n#### **Pertaining to Salvation and the Gospel**\n\nReformed fundamentalists emphasize the importance of personal conversion and regeneration as the means of salvation. They argue that the gospel is the good news of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ, and that this salvation is available to all people through faith in the atoning work of Christ on the cross. They also emphasize the importance of the sovereignty of God in salvation, arguing that God is the one who chooses and regenerates believers.\n\n#### **Other Fundamental Protestant and Biblical Theology**\n\nReformed fundamentalists emphasize the importance of traditional Protestant theology and biblical interpretation. They argue that the Bible is the ultimate authority for Christian doctrine and practice, and that it should be interpreted in light of the historical and cultural context in which it was written. They also emphasize the importance of the Westminster Confession of Faith and other reformed confessions as summaries of Christian doctrine.\n\n### **The Inspiration and Preservation of the Scriptures**\n\nReformed fundamentalists emphasize the importance of the inspiration and preservation of the Scriptures. They argue that the Bible is the inspired word of God, and that it has been preserved through the centuries in its original languages and forms. They also emphasize the importance of the verbal plenary inspiration of Scripture, arguing that every word and letter of Scripture is divinely inspired.\n\n#### **Verbal Plenary Inspiration**\n\nReformed fundamentalists argue that the Bible is verbally plenary inspired, meaning that every word and letter of Scripture is divinely inspired. They argue that this inspiration is not limited to the thoughts and ideas expressed in Scripture, but also extends to the words and languages used to express them.\n\n#### **Preservation of the Texts of Scripture**\n\nReformed fundamentalists emphasize the importance of the preservation of the texts of Scripture. They argue that the original texts of Scripture have been preserved through the centuries in their original languages and forms, and that these texts should be used as the basis for biblical interpretation and translation.\n\n### **Common Principles of Reformation Evangelical Interpretation and Private Reading**\n\nReformed fundamentalists emphasize the importance of reformation evangelical principles of interpretation and private reading. They argue that the Bible should be interpreted in light of its historical and cultural context, and that it should be read and studied privately as well as publicly. They also emphasize the importance of biblical exegesis and commentary as means of interpreting and understanding Scripture.\n\n### **The Classical Creeds and Reformational Confessions**\n\nReformed fundamentalists emphasize the importance of the classical creeds and reformational confessions as summaries of Christian doctrine. They argue that these creeds and confessions should be used as a basis for interpreting and understanding Scripture, and that they should be upheld as authoritative statements of Christian doctrine.\n\n**Congregational Practices**\n\nReformed fundamentalists emphasize the importance of congregational practices that are in line with traditional Protestant and biblical principles. They argue that the church should be governed by a delegation of elders or presbyters, rather than a single pastor or bishop. They also emphasize the importance of congregational worship and the use of the sacraments, particularly baptism and the Lord's Supper.\n\n### **Bible Translation and Usage**\n\nReformed fundamentalists emphasize the importance of accurate and faithful translations of the Bible. They argue that the Bible should be translated into languages that are accessible to all people, and that the original languages and forms of Scripture should be used as the basis for translation and interpretation. They also emphasize the importance of the Authorised Version Tradition, the Byzantine Received Text, and Eastern (Greek) and Western (Greco-Latin) Ecclesiastical Translation Traditions.\n\n### **The Authorised Version Tradition, the Byzantine Received Text, and Eastern (Greek) and Western (Greco-Latin) Ecclesiastical Translation Traditions**\n\nReformed fundamentalists argue that the Authorised Version Tradition, the Byzantine Received Text, and Eastern (Greek) and Western (Greco-Latin) Ecclesiastical Translation Traditions are the most accurate and faithful translations of the Bible. They emphasize the importance of using these translations as the basis for biblical interpretation and study.\n\n### **Modern Versions, Denominational Preferences and Translation Controversies**\n\nReformed fundamentalists argue that modern versions of the Bible, such as the New International Version and the New American Standard Bible, are not as accurate or faithful as the Authorised Version Tradition, the Byzantine Received Text, and Eastern (Greek) and Western (Greco-Latin) Ecclesiastical Translation Traditions. They also emphasize the importance of denominational preferences and translation controversies, and argue that these should be taken into account when choosing a Bible translation.\n\n**Evangelical and Missional Apologetics**\n\nReformed fundamentalists emphasize the importance of evangelical and missional apologetics. They argue that the gospel should be defended and promoted through a variety of means, including personal evangelism, discipleship, and apologetics. They also emphasize the importance of the Bible as a basis for apologetics and evangelism.\n\n### **Bible Apologetics**\n\nReformed fundamentalists argue that the Bible is the ultimate authority for apologetics and evangelism. They emphasize the importance of using the Bible as a basis for defending and promoting the gospel, and argue that this should be done in a way that is respectful and loving towards others.\n\n**Liberal-Modernist Challenge to Verbal Inspiration and Truthfulness of Scripture**\n\nReformed fundamentalists argue that liberal-modernist interpretations of Scripture are a challenge to the verbal inspiration and truthfulness of Scripture. They argue that these interpretations are based on a flawed understanding of the Bible and its authority, and that they should be rejected in favor of a more traditional and conservative understanding of Scripture.\n\n### **Modern Biblical Criticism**\n\nReformed fundamentalists argue that modern biblical criticism is a challenge to the authority and inspiration of Scripture. They argue that this approach to biblical interpretation is flawed and should be rejected in favor of a more traditional and conservative understanding of Scripture.\n\n### **Modern Western Society and Intellectual Unbelief**\n\nReformed fundamentalists argue that modern Western society and intellectual unbelief are a challenge to the authority and inspiration of Scripture. They argue that this unbelief is based on a flawed understanding of the Bible and its authority, and that it should be rejected in favor of a more traditional and conservative understanding of Scripture.\n\n### **Criticism of New-Neo Evangelicalism and the 'Present Downgrade'**\n\nReformed fundamentalists argue that New-Neo Evangelicalism is a departure from the traditional and conservative understanding of Scripture. They argue that this movement is based on a flawed understanding of the Bible and its authority, and that it should be rejected in favor of a more traditional and conservative understanding of Scripture.\n\n### **Materialist and Naturalist Unbelief, and Historic Adamism and Creationism**\n\nReformed fundamentalists argue that materialist and naturalist unbelief, and historic Adamism and creationism are a challenge to the authority and inspiration of Scripture. They argue that these views are based on a flawed understanding of the Bible and its authority, and that they should be rejected in favor of a more traditional and conservative understanding of Scripture.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Christian fundamentalism\n* Conservative evangelicalism\n* Protestant Reformation\n* Biblical inerrancy\n* Verbal plenary inspiration\n* Preservation of the texts of Scripture\n* Congregational worship\n* Sacraments\n* Bible translation and usage\n* Apologetics\n* Evangelism\n* Discipleship\n\n**Resources**\n\n* J.

Born on April 2, 1857, in Yorkshire, England, Griffith's life and writings reflect the era's societal, technological, and scientific advancements.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nGriffith's early life was marked by a strong interest in literature and science. He was educated at the Wakefield Grammar School and later at the University of Edinburgh, where he studied medicine. However, he abandoned his medical studies to pursue a career in literature. Griffith's experiences as a soldier during the 1870s and 1880s influenced his writing, particularly in his depictions of war and its effects on society.\n\n**Teaching Career**\n\nBefore devoting himself to writing full-time, Griffith worked as a teacher. His teaching experiences, particularly in the fields of science and mathematics, shaped his understanding of the world and its complexities. During this period, he began to develop his writing skills, experimenting with various forms and styles.\n\n**Writing Career**\n\nGriffith's writing career spanned over three decades, during which he produced numerous works in various genres, including science fiction, poetry, and non-fiction. His writing often explored the consequences of scientific and technological advancements on human society.\n\n### Early Career\n\nGriffith's early writing career was marked by the publication of his first novel, _A Honeymoon in Space_, in 1901.

The novel, a science fiction romance, told the story of a young woman who, through the power of science, is transformed into a being with extraordinary abilities. The novel's success can be attributed to Griffith's innovative use of scientific concepts and his ability to create a compelling narrative.\n\n### Mid-1890s\n\nThe mid-1890s saw the publication of several notable works by Griffith, including _The Angel of the Revolution_ in 1893 and _The Outlaws of the Air_ in 1895. These novels further solidified Griffith's reputation as a science fiction writer and showcased his ability to explore complex scientific and philosophical concepts.\n\n### Decline\n\nGriffith's writing career began to decline in the early 20th century, as the science fiction genre became increasingly dominated by newer writers, such as H. G. Wells and Jules Verne. Griffith continued to write, but his works failed to achieve the same level of success as his earlier novels.\n\n### Final Years\n\nGriffith's final years were marked by a decline in his physical and mental health. He died on January 11, 1906, at the age of 48, leaving behind a legacy as a pioneering science fiction writer.\n\n**Death**\n\nGriffith's death was a significant loss to the science fiction community, as he was one of the first writers to explore the genre in depth. His works continued to be read and studied by scholars and enthusiasts, cementing his place in the history of science fiction.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nGriffith's legacy as a science fiction writer is multifaceted. His works continue to be studied by scholars and enthusiasts, providing insights into the genre's early development and its relationship to broader societal and scientific trends.\n\n### Place in Science Fiction History\n\nGriffith's place in science fiction history is significant, as he was one of the first writers to explore the genre in depth. His works, particularly _Olga Romanoff_ and _The Angel of the Revolution_, showcased his innovative use of scientific concepts and his ability to create compelling narratives.\n\n### Literary Proficiency\n\nGriffith's literary proficiency was evident in his ability to blend science fiction elements with traditional narrative structures. His works often explored complex scientific and philosophical concepts, demonstrating his understanding of the world and its complexities.\n\n### In Relation to H. G. Wells\n\nGriffith's relationship to H. G. Wells, another prominent science fiction writer, is complex. While both writers explored similar themes and concepts, Griffith's works often preceded Wells' in terms of publication and innovation.\n\n**Personal Views**\n\nGriffith's personal views on various subjects, including religion, politics, and social matters, are reflected in his writing.\n\n### Religion\n\nGriffith's views on religion were complex and often reflected his interest in science and philosophy. He was critical of organized religion, seeing it as a hindrance to human progress.\n\n### Politics\n\nGriffith's views on politics were shaped by his experiences as a soldier and his interest in social justice. He was a strong advocate for social reform and believed in the importance of education and critical thinking.\n\n### Social Matters\n\nGriffith's views on social matters, such as class and inequality, were reflected in his writing. He was critical of the social hierarchies of his time and advocated for greater social equality.\n\n**Publications**\n\nGriffith's publications span a wide range of genres, including poetry, novels, short stories, and non-fiction books.\n\n### Poetry Collections\n\nGriffith published several poetry collections during his lifetime, including _Rhymes and Reasons_ in 1882 and _Poems_ in 1893.\n\n### Novels\n\nGriffith's novels are some of his most notable works, including _A Honeymoon in Space_, _A Journey in Other Worlds_, _Olga Romanoff_, and _The Angel of the Revolution_.\n\n### Short Stories\n\nGriffith published numerous short stories during his lifetime, including _The Outlaws of the Air_ and _The Angel of the Revolution_.\n\n### Short Story Collections\n\nGriffith published several short story collections, including _The Outlaws of the Air_ and _The Angel of the Revolution_.\n\n### Non-fiction Books\n\nGriffith published several non-fiction books, including _The Romance of Science_ in 1893 and _The Science of the Future_ in 1901.\n\n**Explanatory Notes**\n\nGriffith's writing often explored complex scientific and philosophical concepts, which may be unfamiliar to modern readers.

It is bordered by eight countries, including Greece and Bulgaria to the northwest, Georgia to the northeast, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Iran to the east, Iraq and Syria to the southeast, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. With a rich history dating back to the Paleolithic era, Turkey has been an integral part of various civilizations, including the Ottoman Empire, which once spanned parts of three continents.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe name \"Turkey\" is derived from the Middle English term \"Turke,\" which referred to the Turkic peoples who inhabited the region. The term is thought to have originated from the Old Turkic word \"Turuk,\" meaning \"free\" or \"strong.\" The modern Turkish name for the country, \"Türkiye,\" was officially adopted in 1923.\n\n**History**\n\n### Prehistory and ancient history\n\nThe earliest known human habitation in Turkey dates back to the Paleolithic era, with evidence of stone tools and fossils found in various parts of the country. The Neolithic era saw the rise of complex societies, with the development of agriculture and the construction of megalithic structures. The Hittite civilization, which flourished in central Anatolia from the 18th to the 12th centuries BCE, is notable for its contributions to the development of the alphabet and its military prowess.\n\n### Early classical antiquity\n\nThe Phrygians, a non-Indo-European people, inhabited western Anatolia from the 8th to the 6th centuries BCE. The Lydians, who succeeded the Phrygians, are famous for their gold coins and the invention of the first standardized currency. The Achaemenid Empire, under the rule of Cyrus the Great, conquered Lydia in the 6th century BCE, incorporating it into the vast Persian Empire.\n\n### Rome and Byzantine Empire\n\nAfter the fall of the Achaemenid Empire, the Romans conquered much of Anatolia in the 1st century BCE, establishing the province of Asia Minor. The Byzantine Empire, also known as the Eastern Roman Empire, succeeded the Roman Empire in the 4th century CE, with Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul) as its capital. The Byzantine Empire played a significant role in the preservation of classical knowledge and the development of Orthodox Christianity.\n\n### Seljuks and Anatolian beyliks\n\nThe Seljuk Turks, a Turkic people from Central Asia, migrated to Anatolia in the 11th century CE, establishing the Seljuk Sultanate. The Seljuks were instrumental in the spread of Islam in Anatolia, and their legacy can still be seen in the country's architectural and cultural heritage. The Anatolian beyliks, smaller Turkish principalities, emerged in the 13th century CE, with the Ottoman Empire ultimately absorbing them.\n\n### Ottoman Empire\n\nThe Ottoman Empire, founded by Osman Bey in the late 13th century CE, grew into one of the largest and most influential empires in history, covering parts of three continents. The Ottoman Empire played a significant role in the development of the modern Middle East, with its capital, Constantinople, serving as a major center of trade, culture, and learning.\n\n### Republic of Türkiye\n\nThe Ottoman Empire collapsed after World War I, and the modern Republic of Türkiye was established in 1923 by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. The new republic adopted a secular constitution, introduced reforms aimed at modernizing the country, and established diplomatic relations with other nations. Turkey joined the United Nations in 1945 and has since played an active role in international affairs.\n\n**Administrative divisions**\n\nTurkey is divided into 81 provinces, which are further divided into districts and municipalities. The provinces are administered by governors appointed by the central government, while the districts and municipalities are managed by elected officials.\n\n**Government and politics**\n\n### Parties and elections\n\nTurkey has a multi-party system, with several parties participating in elections. The ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) has dominated politics since the 2000s, while the opposition parties include the Republican People's Party (CHP), the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP), and the Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP).\n\n### Law\n\nTurkey has a civil law system, with a constitution that guarantees individual rights and freedoms. The country has a well-developed criminal code and a strong judicial system, with the Constitutional Court serving as the highest court in the land.\n\n### Foreign relations\n\nTurkey is a member of various international organizations, including the United Nations, NATO, and the Council of Europe. The country has diplomatic relations with over 100 countries and has played a key role in regional and international affairs.\n\n### Military\n\nTurkey has a large and well-equipped military, with a strong emphasis on defense and security. The country has a long history of military intervention, including the 1974 invasion of Cyprus and the 2016 coup attempt.\n\n### Human rights\n\nTurkey has been criticized for its human rights record, particularly with regards to freedom of speech, press freedom, and the treatment of minority groups. The country has made efforts to improve its human rights record, including the establishment of a national human rights institution.\n\n### LGBTQ rights\n\nTurkey has a relatively poor record on LGBTQ rights, with the country banning same-sex marriage and prohibiting the promotion of LGBTQ identity in public schools. However, there are efforts underway to improve the situation, including the establishment of LGBTQ organizations and advocacy groups.\n\n**Geography**\n\n### Biodiversity\n\nTurkey is home to a diverse range of flora and fauna, with over 5,000 species of plants and animals found in the country. The country's geography, ranging from the Mediterranean to the Black Sea, supports a wide range of ecosystems, including forests, grasslands, and wetlands.\n\n### Climate\n\nTurkey has a varied climate, ranging from Mediterranean to temperate and continental. The country experiences a range of weather conditions, including hot summers, mild winters, and occasional earthquakes.\n\n**Economy**\n\n### Infrastructure\n\nTurkey has a well-developed infrastructure, with a strong transportation network, including roads, highways, and airports.

Born in Ephesus, a city in ancient Greece, Heraclitus was a member of the noble class and was known for his reclusive and enigmatic nature.\n\n**Life**\n\nLittle is known about Heraclitus' life, and most of what is known comes from his writings and the testimony of other ancient philosophers. He was said to have been a member of the noble class in Ephesus and was known for his reclusive nature. Heraclitus was also known for his dislike of politics and his disdain for the Athenians, whom he saw as corrupt and degenerate.\n\nHeraclitus' life was marked by controversy and conflict. He was said to have been involved in a dispute with his brother over their family's estate, and he was also known to have been involved in a controversy with the Ephesians over the management of the city's finances. Despite these controversies, Heraclitus remained a respected figure in ancient Greece, and his philosophy had a significant impact on the development of Western philosophy.\n\n**On Nature**\n\nHeraclitus' philosophy was centered on the concept of the natural world and the principles that govern it. He believed that the natural world was characterized by constant change and flux, and that all things are in a state of becoming rather than being.

The protests, which began in November 2022, were characterized by calls for greater transparency and accountability in the government's pandemic policies, as well as demands for an end to the country's strict zero-COVID policy.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on China, with the country implementing some of the most stringent lockdown measures in the world. The government's zero-COVID policy, which aimed to eradicate the virus entirely, led to widespread lockdowns, travel restrictions, and other measures that had a profound impact on the country's economy and society.\n\nThe protests were also influenced by the growing democracy movement in China, which has been gaining momentum in recent years. The movement, which advocates for greater political freedom and accountability, has been inspired by the experiences of protesters in Hong Kong, who have been fighting for greater autonomy and democracy since 2019.\n\n**Sitong Bridge Protest**\n\nOne of the earliest protests related to the COVID-19 pandemic in China took place on October 26, 2022, at the Sitong Bridge in Beijing.

The vessel is designed to carry passengers to depths of up to 12,500 feet (3,800 meters) and is equipped with advanced life support systems and communication equipment.\n\nDives to wreck of Titanic\n\nThe Titan had completed several dives to the Titanic wreck in the past, with the most recent expedition taking place in June 2023. The vessel was carrying five passengers, including a filmmaker, a researcher, and three tourists, who were all experienced divers and explorers.\n\nSafety\n\nOceanGate has a reputation for prioritizing safety, and the company has implemented various measures to ensure the well-being of its passengers and crew. These measures include regular maintenance of the submersible vessel, thorough risk assessments, and comprehensive training programs for all personnel involved in the expeditions.\n\nPrior concerns\n\nHowever, there were prior concerns about the safety of the Titan and its operations. In 2020, the US Coast Guard had issued a warning to commercial submersible operators, including OceanGate, regarding the risks associated with diving to depths below 1,000 feet (300 meters). Additionally, there were reports of technical issues with the Titan's life support systems and communication equipment in the months leading up to the incident.\n\nPrevious incidents\n\nThere were also previous incidents involving the Titan and its crew. In 2019, the vessel experienced a technical malfunction during a dive to the Titanic wreck, which resulted in a minor delay but no injuries. In 2020, a crew member was injured during a training exercise, but the incident was not publicly disclosed by OceanGate.\n\nIncident\n\nExpedition arrangements\n\nThe June 2023 expedition was scheduled to take place over several days, with the Titan carrying passengers to the Titanic wreck and back to the surface. The expedition was led by Stockton Rush, the CEO of OceanGate, who had extensive experience with deep-sea submersible operations.\n\n16–17 June preparations\n\nOn June 16-17, the Titan was prepared for the expedition, with the crew conducting routine checks and maintenance on the submersible vessel. The passengers arrived at the site and were briefed on the expedition plan and safety procedures.\n\n18 June, dive, disappearance, and implosion\n\nOn June 18, the Titan left the surface and began its descent to the Titanic wreck. However, at around 2:00 AM local time, the vessel lost contact with the support ship. Despite attempts to reestablish communication, the Titan remained lost for several hours. At around 9:00 AM, the US Coast Guard announced that the Titan had imploded, resulting in the loss of all five passengers on board.\n\n18–22 June, search and rescue efforts\n\nThe US Coast Guard, along with other naval and aviation assets, launched a search and rescue operation to locate the wreckage of the Titan. The operation was extensive, involving multiple aircraft, ships, and divers. On June 22, the wreckage of the Titan was finally located at a depth of around 12,500 feet (3,800 meters).\n\n22 June, discovery of debris\n\nOn June 22, a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) was deployed to the site to collect debris from the wreckage of the Titan. The footage from the ROV showed the extent of the damage, with the submersible vessel severely crushed and deformed.\n\nFatalities\n\nThe incident resulted in the loss of five lives, including Stockton Rush, the CEO of OceanGate. The victims were all experienced divers and explorers, and their families have expressed their shock and grief at the loss.\n\nRecovery operations\n\nThe recovery operation was complex and challenging, involving the use of specialized equipment and teams of experts. The wreckage of the Titan was eventually recovered, and an investigation into the incident was launched.\n\nInvestigations\n\nUnited States\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) was responsible for investigating the incident. The investigation is ongoing, but preliminary findings suggest that the implosion was likely caused by a combination of factors, including a failure of the submersible vessel's hull and a loss of communication with the support ship.\n\nCanada\n\nThe Transportation Safety Board of Canada (TSB) has also launched an investigation into the incident. The TSB is examining the safety procedures and protocols used by OceanGate and the relevant authorities.\n\nLawsuit\n\nA lawsuit has been filed against OceanGate by the families of the victims. The lawsuit alleges that the company was negligent in its operations and failed to provide adequate safety measures for its passengers.\n\nFinancial costs of operations\n\nThe incident has resulted in significant financial costs for OceanGate, including the recovery of the wreckage and the investigation into the incident. The company has also faced criticism and scrutiny from regulatory authorities.\n\nReactions\n\nThe incident has sparked a debate about the safety of deep-sea submersible operations and the need for greater regulation and oversight. The US Coast Guard has announced that it will be conducting a review of its policies and procedures regarding commercial submersible operations.\n\nIn social and mass media\n\nThe incident has been widely reported in the media, with many outlets covering the story and its implications for the safety of deep-sea submersible operations. Social media platforms have also been filled with tributes and condolences for the victims and their families.\n\nSee also\n\n* Deep-sea submersible\n* OceanGate\n* Titanic wreck\n* National Transportation Safety Board\n* Transportation Safety Board of Canada\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

This genre is characterized by low-to-medium budget films, often produced independently outside of the traditional Hollywood studio system. Indiewood films typically feature complex, often unconventional storylines, and are frequently directed by artists who value creative freedom over commercial appeal.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe term \"Indiewood\" was first coined by film critic Owen Gleiberman in 1995 to describe the increasing number of independent films being produced in the United States. However, the roots of Indiewood stretch back to the 1960s and 1970s, when a new generation of filmmakers began to challenge the conventional studio system. These filmmakers, often associated with the film movements of the French New Wave and American Underground, sought to create more personal, experimental, and innovative films.\n\n**Divisions**\n\nIndiewood films can be broadly categorized into several subgenres, including:\n\n* **Critical art house cinema**: films that prioritize artistic expression and critical acclaim over commercial success.\n* **Genre films**: films that blend elements of horror, science fiction, or other genres with the independent spirit.\n* **Low-budget thrillers**: films that use limited resources to create tense, suspenseful narratives.\n* **Romantic dramas**: films that focus on character-driven stories and emotional arcs.\n\n**Other \"mini-major\" subdivisions/indie distributors**\n\nSeveral smaller, independent distributors have played a significant role in the development of Indiewood, including:\n\n* **Miramax Films**: a pioneering independent distributor that played a key role in the success of films like \"Sex, Lies, and Videotape\" (1989) and \"Clerks\" (1994).\n* **New Line Cinema**: an independent distributor that specialized in low-budget, genre films, including \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" (1984) and \"The Blair Witch Project\" (1999).\n* **A24**: a modern independent distributor that has released a number of critically acclaimed films, including \"Moonlight\" (2016) and \"Lady Bird\" (2017).\n\n**Sources**\n\nThe sources of funding for Indiewood films have varied over the years, but have often included:\n\n* **Private investors**: wealthy individuals who invest in films in exchange for a share of the profits.\n* **Tax incentives**: government programs that offer tax breaks to film producers who shoot on location in specific areas.\n* **Crowdfunding**: online platforms that allow filmmakers to raise funds from a large number of individuals.\n\n**Differences from Hollywood**\n\nIndiewood films differ from Hollywood films in several key ways, including:\n\n* **Budget**: Indiewood films typically have lower budgets than Hollywood films, often ranging from $500,000 to $5 million.\n* **Creative control**: Indiewood filmmakers often have more creative control over their projects than Hollywood filmmakers, who are frequently subject to studio input.\n* **Marketing**: Indiewood films are often marketed through word-of-mouth and online promotion, rather than through traditional advertising campaigns.\n\n**List of selected Indiewood/Pre-Indiewood filmmakers**\n\nSome notable Indiewood and Pre-Indiewood filmmakers include:\n\n* **John Cassavetes**: a pioneer of the American independent film movement, known for films like \"Shadows\" (1959) and \"Faces\" (1968).\n* **Woody Allen**: a director and actor known for films like \"Annie Hall\" (1977) and \"Manhattan\" (1979).\n* **Martin Scorsese**: a director known for films like \"Mean Streets\" (1973) and \"Taxi Driver\" (1976).\n* **Steven Soderbergh**: a director known for films like \"sex, lies, and videotape\" (1989) and \"Traffic\" (2000).\n* **Richard Linklater**: a director known for films like \"Slacker\" (1991) and \"Boyhood\" (2014).\n\n**List of selected notable and important Pre-Indiewood films**\n\n### Pre-1950s\n\n* **\"The Gold Rush\" (1925)**: a silent comedy film directed by Charlie Chaplin.\n* **\"City Lights\" (1931)**: a silent romantic comedy film directed by Charlie Chaplin.\n\n### 1950s\n\n* **\"Shadows\" (1959)**: a drama film directed by John Cassavetes.\n* **\"Baby Doll\" (1956)**: a drama film directed by Elia Kazan.\n\n### 1960s\n\n* **\"Faces\" (1968)**: a drama film directed by John Cassavetes.\n* **\"Midnight Cowboy\" (1969)**: a drama film directed by John Schlesinger.\n\n### 1970s\n\n* **\"Mean Streets\" (1973)**: a crime drama film directed by Martin Scorsese.\n* **\"Taxi Driver\" (1976)**: a crime drama film directed by Martin Scorsese.\n* **\"Annie Hall\" (1977)**: a romantic comedy film directed by Woody Allen.\n\n**List of notable and important Indiewood films**\n\n### 1980s\n\n* **\"sex, lies, and videotape\" (1989)**: a drama film directed by Steven Soderbergh.\n* **\"Do the Right Thing\" (1989)**: a comedy-drama film directed by Spike Lee.\n\n### 1990s\n\n* **\"Clerks\" (1994)**: a comedy film directed by Kevin Smith.\n* **\"El Mariachi\" (1992)**: a crime drama film directed by Robert Rodriguez.\n* **\"The Blair Witch Project\" (1999)**: a horror film directed by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez.\n\n### 2000s\n\n* **\"Mulholland Drive\" (2001)**: a neo-noir mystery film directed by David Lynch.\n* **\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" (2004)**: a romantic drama film directed by Michel Gondry.\n* **\"Lady in the Water\" (2006)**: a fantasy film directed by M.
