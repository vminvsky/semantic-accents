The outbreak affected several states in the central and southern regions of the country, resulting in significant damage, injuries, and loss of life.\n\n# Meteorological Synopsis\n\n## March 5\n\nThe outbreak began on March 5, 2022, as a complex low-pressure system developed over the central Great Plains. This system, fueled by a strong low-pressure system over the Rocky Mountains, began to shift eastward, bringing with it the potential for severe thunderstorms and tornadoes. As the system moved into the central Great Plains, it interacted with a strong cold front, leading to the development of a strong dry line.\n\nThe dry line, a boundary between dry and moist air, played a significant role in the development of severe thunderstorms and tornadoes. As the dry line moved eastward, it interacted with the cold front, leading to the development of strong updrafts and downdrafts. These updrafts and downdrafts, in turn, led to the formation of supercells, which are rotating thunderstorms capable of producing tornadoes.\n\n## March 3\n\nThe supercells that developed on March 5 were particularly intense, with some producing multiple tornadoes. The first tornado of the outbreak occurred in the early afternoon in the state of Texas, where a weak tornado touched down in the town of Granbury. This was followed by a series of tornadoes in the surrounding areas, including the city of Waxahachie, where a tornado caused significant damage and injured several people.\n\nAs the outbreak continued, the severity of the tornadoes increased, with multiple EF3 and EF4 tornadoes touching down in the states of Oklahoma, Kansas, and Missouri. These tornadoes caused significant damage and injured several people, with some communities being nearly destroyed.\n\n## March 6–7\n\nOn March 6 and 7, the outbreak continued, with multiple tornadoes touching down in the central and southern United States. The most significant tornado of the outbreak occurred on March 6 in the state of Iowa, where a massive EF4 tornado caused significant damage and injured several people.\n\nThe tornado, which touched down in the town of Pella, was particularly intense, with wind speeds reaching up to 200 miles per hour. The tornado caused significant damage to homes, businesses, and infrastructure, with some buildings being completely destroyed.\n\n## March 7 event\n\nOn March 7, multiple tornadoes touched down in the state of Iowa, including a significant EF3 tornado that caused significant damage in the town of Winterset. This tornado, which touched down in the early afternoon, caused significant damage to homes and businesses, with some buildings being partially destroyed.\n\nThe outbreak continued throughout the day, with multiple tornadoes touching down in the surrounding areas. The most significant tornado of the day occurred in the town of Newton, where a massive EF4 tornado caused significant damage and injured several people.\n\n# Confirmed Tornadoes\n\n## March 5 Event\n\nOn March 5, a total of 22 tornadoes were reported in the United States, with several of these tornadoes being significant. The most significant tornado of the day occurred in the state of Texas, where a massive EF4 tornado caused significant damage and injured several people.\n\n## March 6 Event\n\nOn March 6, a total of 25 tornadoes were reported in the United States, with several of these tornadoes being significant. The most significant tornado of the day occurred in the state of Iowa, where a massive EF4 tornado caused significant damage and injured several people.\n\n## March 7 Event\n\nOn March 7, a total of 20 tornadoes were reported in the United States, with several of these tornadoes being significant. The most significant tornado of the day occurred in the state of Iowa, where a massive EF4 tornado caused significant damage and injured several people.\n\n## Macksburg–Winterset–Norwalk–Colfax–Newton, Iowa\n\nOn March 7, a significant tornado outbreak occurred in the state of Iowa, with multiple tornadoes touching down in the Macksburg, Winterset, Norwalk, Colfax, and Newton areas. The most significant tornado of the day occurred in the town of Newton, where a massive EF4 tornado caused significant damage and injured several people.\n\nThe tornado, which touched down in the early afternoon, caused significant damage to homes, businesses, and infrastructure, with some buildings being partially destroyed. The tornado also caused significant disruptions to the local power grid, leaving thousands of people without electricity.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe Tornado Outbreak of March 5–7, 2022, resulted in significant damage and loss of life across the United States. The outbreak was particularly intense in the states of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, and Iowa, where multiple tornadoes touched down and caused significant damage.\n\nThe most significant tornado of the outbreak occurred in the town of Newton, Iowa, where a massive EF4 tornado caused significant damage and injured several people. The tornado also caused significant disruptions to the local power grid, leaving thousands of people without electricity.\n\nIn the aftermath of the outbreak, emergency responders and relief teams were deployed to affected areas to provide assistance and support to those in need. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) also provided significant support to affected areas, including the deployment of emergency aid and resources.\n\n# See Also\n\n* List of tornadoes in the United States\n* Tornado Alley\n* Tornado outbreak\n* Severe thunderstorm\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is based on information from various sources, including news reports and official government reports.\n\n# References\n\nThis article does not include any references.\n\n# External Links\n\n* National Weather Service\n* Federal Emergency Management Agency\n* American Red Cross", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

He was born in Lycopolis, Egypt, and spent most of his life in Rome, where he developed a unique and influential philosophical system that synthesized elements of Plato, Aristotle, and Eastern mysticism.\n\n**Biography**\n\n### Expedition to Persia and Return to Rome\n\nPlotinus was born in Lycopolis, Egypt, to a Greek family. His father, Eustochius, was a Hermetic philosopher and a devout follower of the Egyptian gods. Plotinus's early life and education are shrouded in mystery, but it is known that he traveled extensively throughout the Mediterranean, including an expedition to Persia, where he studied various philosophical and spiritual traditions.\n\nUpon his return to Rome, Plotinus became a pupil of the famous Neopythagorean philosopher Ammonius Saccas. Under Ammonius's tutelage, Plotinus delved deeply into the teachings of Plato and developed his own philosophical system. He also became acquainted with various Christian, Gnostic, and Hermetic texts, which would later influence his thought.\n\n### Later Life\n\nPlotinus spent the remainder of his life in Rome, where he taught philosophy and attracted a large following of students, including Porphyry, who would become his biographer. Plotinus's teachings emphasized the importance of reason, the immortality of the soul, and the attainment of spiritual enlightenment through mystical experience. He also advocated for a simple and austere lifestyle, free from the corrupting influences of wealth and power.\n\nPlotinus died in 270 CE, at the age of 65, while on a journey to Campania.\n\n**Major Ideas**\n\n### The One\n\nAt the heart of Plotinus's philosophy lies the concept of the One ( hen kai pan ), the ultimate reality and source of all existence. The One is beyond human comprehension, a unity that transcends all duality and multiplicity. It is the uncaused cause, the source of all being and becoming.\n\n### Emanation by the One\n\nAccording to Plotinus, the One emanates a series of higher and lower realities, including the Intellect ( nous ), the Soul ( psyche ), and the material world. This emanation is not a causal relationship, but rather a series of successive unfoldments, each one more diminished and imperfect than the last.\n\n### The True Human and Happiness\n\nFor Plotinus, the true human is the one who has achieved spiritual enlightenment and is united with the One. This union is the source of true happiness and fulfillment, which is not dependent on external circumstances, but rather on the internal state of the soul.\n\n### Henosis\n\nHenosis (lit. \"oneness\") is the ultimate goal of Plotinus's philosophy, the attainment of unity with the One. This is not a intellectual understanding, but a direct, mystical experience of the divine. Henosis is the source of true wisdom, which is not a knowledge of external things, but a knowledge of the self and the divine.\n\n**Relation with Contemporary Philosophy and Religion**\n\n### Plotinus's Relation to Plato\n\nPlotinus's philosophy is deeply rooted in the teachings of Plato, whom he revered as a divine revelation. However, Plotinus also departed from Plato in significant ways, developing a more complex and nuanced understanding of the nature of reality and the human condition.\n\n### Plotinus and the Gnostics\n\nPlotinus's philosophy shares some similarities with Gnosticism, particularly in its emphasis on the importance of spiritual knowledge and the attainment of mystical experience. However, Plotinus's system is more systematic and comprehensive, and he rejects many of the more radical Gnostic teachings.\n\n### Against Causal Astrology\n\nPlotinus was a vocal critic of causal astrology, which he saw as a form of superstition and idolatry. According to Plotinus, the stars and planets are mere reflections of the higher realities, and do not exert any causal influence on human affairs.\n\n**Film Studies**\n\nPlotinus's philosophy has been the subject of several film studies, including the 2006 documentary \"The Seeds of Time,\" which explores the relationship between Plotinus's thought and the concept of time.\n\n**Influence**\n\n### Ancient World\n\nPlotinus's philosophy had a significant impact on the development of Neoplatonism, which became a dominant philosophical school in the ancient world. His ideas also influenced the thought of various Christian, Gnostic, and Hermetic writers.\n\n### Christianity\n\nPlotinus's philosophy influenced the development of Christian thought, particularly in the areas of mysticism and the nature of the Trinity. However, many Christian writers also rejected Plotinus's ideas, seeing them as incompatible with the teachings of the Bible.\n\n### Islam\n\nPlotinus's philosophy was known to and respected by many Islamic thinkers, including Avicenna and Ibn Sina. His ideas on the nature of reality and the human condition are still studied and debated in Islamic circles today.\n\n### Judaism\n\nPlotinus's philosophy had a limited impact on Jewish thought, although some Jewish writers, such as Maimonides, were influenced by his ideas.\n\n### Renaissance\n\nDuring the Renaissance, Plotinus's philosophy was rediscovered and studied by many European thinkers, including Ficino and Pico della Mirandola. His ideas on the nature of the human condition and the attainment of spiritual enlightenment were particularly influential.\n\n### Great Britain\n\nPlotinus's philosophy was also studied and debated in Great Britain, particularly during the 17th and 18th centuries.

The battle began in February 2022, as a continuation of the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War, and lasted for several months, resulting in significant losses for both sides.\n\n**Background**\n\n### War in Donbas\n\nThe Donbas region has been embroiled in conflict since 2014, when pro-Russian separatists declared independence in the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, leading to the outbreak of the War in Donbas. The conflict has resulted in significant human suffering, with thousands of deaths and injuries, as well as widespread destruction of infrastructure and economic losses.\n\n### Prior operations\n\nIn the years leading up to the 2022 battle, Ukraine and Russia had engaged in several rounds of fighting, with varying degrees of intensity. In 2021, Russian-backed separatists launched a series of attacks on Ukrainian positions, which were repelled with the help of Ukrainian forces. However, these skirmishes only served to heighten tensions and set the stage for the larger conflict that was to come.\n\n**Prelude**\n\n### Russian objectives\n\nRussia's objectives in the 2022 battle of Donbas were multifaceted. On the one hand, Moscow sought to consolidate control over the Donbas region, which has significant economic and strategic importance. The region is home to several key industries, including coal mining, steel production, and agriculture, and its control would give Russia a significant economic and strategic foothold in the region.\n\nOn the other hand, Russia's objectives in the battle were also motivated by a desire to weaken Ukraine and undermine its sovereignty. By launching a large-scale military operation against Ukraine, Russia sought to demonstrate its military power and intimidate its neighbor into submission.\n\n**Opposing forces and foreign involvement**\n\n### Russian and pro-Russian forces\n\nThe Russian military, along with pro-Russian separatist groups, played a key role in the 2022 battle of Donbas. Russian forces were deployed in large numbers, with estimates suggesting that up to 150,000 troops were involved in the conflict. These forces were supported by a range of military hardware, including tanks, artillery, and aircraft.\n\nPro-Russian separatist groups, such as the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) and the Luhansk People's Republic (LPR), also played a significant role in the conflict. These groups were led by a range of leaders, including Alexander Zakharchenko and Igor Plotnitsky, who were known for their extreme nationalist and anti-Ukrainian views.\n\n### Ukrainian forces\n\nUkrainian forces, along with their international backers, played a key role in resisting the Russian advance. Ukrainian troops were deployed along the front lines, where they engaged in fierce fighting with Russian and separatist forces. Ukraine also received significant military aid from its international backers, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and other European countries.\n\n### Foreign support for Ukraine\n\nUkraine received significant foreign support during the 2022 battle of Donbas. The United States, in particular, played a key role in providing military aid to Ukraine, including billions of dollars' worth of equipment and training. Other countries, such as the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia, also provided significant military aid to Ukraine.\n\n**Battle**\n\n### Early operations (April–May 2022)\n\nThe 2022 battle of Donbas began in earnest in April 2022, when Russian and separatist forces launched a series of attacks on Ukrainian positions in the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts.

The capital is a remarkable example of the art and culture of the Mauryan Empire, which was one of the largest empires of ancient India. The Lion Capital is renowned for its intricate carvings, rich symbolism, and historical significance. It has been designated as a national monument of India and is considered one of the most iconic symbols of the country.\n\n## History\n\nThe Lion Capital of Ashoka was created during the reign of Emperor Ashoka, who ruled the Mauryan Empire from 269 BCE to 232 BCE. Ashoka was a devout Buddhist who was instrumental in spreading Buddhism throughout his empire. He commissioned numerous monuments and sculptures, including the Lion Capital, to commemorate his conquests and to promote Buddhism. The Lion Capital was originally used as the capital of a column, possibly the Ashoka Pillar, which was erected at Sarnath, a sacred site for Buddhists. The column was built to commemorate the site where the Buddha first taught his doctrine to his five ascetic followers.\n\nThe Lion Capital was created by skilled artisans who were trained in the Gandhara and Mathura schools of art. These schools were renowned for their expertise in sculpture and architecture. The artisans used the ancient technique of carving and modeling to create the intricate designs and patterns on the capital.\n\n## Excavation and display\n\nThe Lion Capital was discovered in 1905 by British archaeologist John Marshall during excavations at Sarnath. The capital was found in a damaged state, with several pieces missing, including the column to which it was originally attached. The capital was later restored and is now displayed at the Sarnath Museum, which is a part of the Archaeological Survey of India.\n\n## Description\n\nThe Lion Capital is a sculptural capital that represents the Mauryan style of art. It consists of a circular base, a bell-shaped middle section, and a lotus flower-shaped top. The base is decorated with intricate carvings of lions, while the bell-shaped middle section features a frieze of four lions seated back to back, with their faces towards the center. The lotus flower-shaped top is adorned with a finial, which is missing in the original capital.\n\nThe lions on the capital are depicted in a naturalistic style, with their bodies and heads carved in a way that gives them a sense of movement. The lions are seated on a pedestal, with their paws resting on the pedestal and their heads turned towards the center. The lions are surrounded by a frieze of four wheels, which are believed to represent the four continents of the ancient world.\n\n## Symbolism\n\nThe Lion Capital is rich in symbolism and represents several themes and ideas. The lions on the capital represent the power and bravery of the Mauryan Empire, while the four wheels represent the four directions and the four continents. The lotus flower-shaped top represents the cycle of birth, growth, and decay, which is a central theme in Buddhism.\n\nThe capital also represents the Mauryan Empire's cultural and artistic achievements. The intricate carvings and patterns on the capital demonstrate the skill and expertise of the artisans who created it. The capital also represents the Mauryan Empire's rich cultural heritage, which was influenced by various cultures and traditions.\n\n## Influences\n\nThe Lion Capital of Ashoka was influenced by various cultures and traditions, including the Gandhara and Mathura schools of art. The Mauryan Empire was a melting pot of cultures, and the capital reflects this diversity. The capital was also influenced by Buddhist art and architecture, which was popular during the Mauryan period.\n\n## Legacy\n\nThe Lion Capital of Ashoka has had a significant legacy and influence on Indian art and culture. It has been an inspiration to many artists and architects, who have been influenced by its intricate carvings and patterns. The capital has also been a symbol of Indian culture and identity, representing the country's rich cultural heritage.\n\n## Reconstructions\n\nThe Lion Capital of Ashoka has undergone several reconstructions and restorations over the years. The capital was first discovered in 1905, and it was later restored and displayed at the Sarnath Museum. The capital has also been the subject of various studies and research, which have helped to shed light on its history and significance.\n\n## Related sculpture\n\nThe Lion Capital of Ashoka is part of a larger collection of sculptures and monuments that were created during the Mauryan period. Some of the related sculptures include the Ashoka Pillar, which is a pillar that was erected at Sarnath, and the Amaravati Sculpture, which is a sculpture that was created at Amaravati, a town in the state of Andhra Pradesh.\n\n## Notes\n\nThe Lion Capital of Ashoka is a remarkable example of the art and culture of the Mauryan Empire. It has been designated as a national monument of India and is considered one of the most iconic symbols of the country. The capital is a testament to the skill and expertise of the artisans who created it, and it continues to inspire artists and architects to this day.\n\n## References\n\nThis article does not include any references.\n\n## Cited works\n\nThis article does not include any cited works.\n\n## Further reading\n\nFor further reading on the Lion Capital of Ashoka, see:\n\n* Marshall, J.

The election was contested by 344 candidates from 61 political parties, with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leading the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) leading the Secular Democratic Forces (SDF).\n\n**Background**\n\n### TTAADC elections\n\nThe Tripura Tribal Areas Autonomous District Council (TTAADC) elections were held in 2019, where the Indigenous People's Front of Tripura (IPFT) won a majority, tripping the BJP-led government in the state. The IPFT's victory led to increased demands for a separate state of Tipraland, which has been a contentious issue in Tripura politics.\n\n### Major political defections\n\nIn the lead-up to the 2023 election, several prominent politicians defected to the BJP, including former Congress MLA, Sudip Roy Barman, and former Tipra Haat leader, Bhanu Lal Saha. These defections were seen as a significant boost to the BJP's chances in the election.\n\n**Schedule**\n\nThe election schedule was announced by the Election Commission of India (ECI) on 15 January 2023. The election was held on 16 February 2023, with the counting of votes taking place on 2 March 2023.\n\n**Parties and Alliances**\n\n### National Democratic Alliance\n\nThe National Democratic Alliance (NDA) was the main alliance in the election, with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leading the coalition. The BJP had formed an alliance with the Indigenous People's Front of Tripura (IPFT), the Tipra Motha Party (TMP), and several smaller parties.\n\n### Secular Democratic Forces\n\nThe Secular Democratic Forces (SDF) was the main opposition alliance, led by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI-M). The CPI-M had formed an alliance with the Indian National Congress (INC), the Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP), and several smaller parties.\n\n### Tipra Motha Party\n\nThe Tipra Motha Party (TMP) was a new party that emerged in the lead-up to the election. The TMP was founded by Pradyot Debbarman, a member of the royal family of Tripura. The TMP contested 43 seats in the election and won 14 seats, making it the third-largest party in the assembly.\n\n### Others\n\nSeveral smaller parties and independent candidates also contested the election, including the All India Trinamool Congress (AITC), the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), and the Communist Party of India (CPI).\n\n**Candidates**\n\nA total of 344 candidates contested the election, with several prominent politicians including incumbent Chief Minister, Manik Saha, and former Chief Minister, Biplab Kumar Deb, contesting the election.\n\n**Issues**\n\n### 10323 Teachers batch\n\nOne of the key issues in the election was the recruitment of 10323 teachers, which had been stalled for several years. The BJP had promised to clear the recruitment list if it came to power, which was a major issue for many young voters.\n\n### Tipraland Movement\n\nThe Tipraland movement, led by the IPFT, was another key issue in the election. The movement demands the creation of a separate state of Tipraland, which has been a contentious issue in Tripura politics for several years.\n\n### Bru refugees\n\nThe issue of Bru refugees, who were forced to flee their homes in Mizoram due to ethnic violence, was also a major issue in the election. The BJP had promised to provide relief and rehabilitation to the Bru refugees, which was a major issue for many voters.\n\n**Campaigns**\n\n### Bharatiya Janata Party\n\nThe BJP's campaign focused on the party's development agenda, including the recruitment of 10323 teachers, the creation of new industries, and the improvement of infrastructure. The party also highlighted its achievements in the field of healthcare and education.\n\n### Communist Party of India (Marxist)\n\nThe CPI-M's campaign focused on the party's socialist agenda, including the creation of a more equal society, the protection of the rights of marginalized communities, and the promotion of public sector enterprises.\n\n### Indian National Congress\n\nThe INC's campaign focused on the party's development agenda, including the creation of new industries, the improvement of infrastructure, and the promotion of education and healthcare.\n\n### Tipra Motha Party\n\nThe TMP's campaign focused on the party's demand for a separate state of Tipraland, which was a major issue in the election.

The DRACO system is a small spacecraft that orbits Didymos and provides high-resolution images of the asteroid.\n\n### Effect of the Impact on Dimorphos and Didymos\n\nThe impact of the DART spacecraft on Dimorphos is expected to alter the asteroid's orbit around Didymos. The extent of the effect will depend on the velocity and mass of the DART spacecraft, as well as the physical properties of Dimorphos.\n\n### Observations of the Impact\n\nThe DART mission includes a range of instruments and systems to observe the impact and its effects. The spacecraft is equipped with a range of cameras and other instruments that will capture high-resolution images and data on the impact.\n\n### Follow-up Mission\n\nA follow-up mission to the DART mission is planned for 2026, which will include a spacecraft called the Europa Clipper. The Europa Clipper will study the Jupiter moon Europa and its subsurface ocean.\n\n### AIDA Mission Architecture\n\nThe DART mission is part of a larger mission architecture known as AIDA (Asteroid Impact and Deflection Assessment). The AIDA mission includes a range of spacecraft and instruments that will study the asteroid Didymos and its moons.\n\n**Mission Profile**\n\nThe DART mission has a complex profile that involves a range of phases, including:\n\n### Target Asteroid\n\nThe target asteroid for the DART mission is Dimorphos, a small asteroid that orbits a larger asteroid called Didymos.\n\n### Preflight Preparations\n\nThe DART spacecraft underwent a range of preflight preparations, including integration with the secondary spacecraft and testing of the spacecraft's systems.\n\n### Launch\n\nThe DART spacecraft was launched on November 24, 2021, from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California.\n\n### Transit\n\nThe DART spacecraft traveled to the Didymos asteroid system, where it will impact Dimorphos.\n\n### Course of the Impact\n\nThe DART spacecraft will impact Dimorphos at a speed of approximately 6.6 km/s (14,700 mph). The impact will be observed by a range of instruments and systems, including cameras and other sensors.\n\n### Sequence of Operations for Impact\n\nThe sequence of operations for the impact includes:\n\n1. **Launch:** The DART spacecraft is launched from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California.\n2. **Transit:** The DART spacecraft travels to the Didymos asteroid system.\n3. **Course correction:** The DART spacecraft performs a course correction to ensure accurate impact with Dimorphos.\n4. **Impact:** The DART spacecraft impacts Dimorphos at a speed of approximately 6.6 km/s (14,700 mph).\n\n**Gallery**\n\n* Image of the DART spacecraft: [insert image]\n* Image of the Didymos asteroid system: [insert image]\n* Image of the DRACO system: [insert image]\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Asteroid deflection\n* Planetary defense\n* Spacecraft\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The DART mission is a response to the growing threat of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) and the need for effective asteroid deflection techniques.\n* The DART mission is the first of its kind, with the goal of demonstrating the feasibility of deflecting an asteroid's orbit using a kinetic impactor.\n\n**References**\n\n* None\n\n**External Links**\n\n* NASA's Planetary Defense Coordination Office (PDCO)\n* NASA's DART mission website\n* European Space Agency's (ESA) AIDA mission website", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The incident involved the sinking of the Russian Navy's Slava-class cruiser, Moskva, in the Black Sea.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Moskva was a Slava-class cruiser that was commissioned in 1983 and had served in the Soviet and Russian navies for nearly four decades. The ship had been involved in several international incidents and had been involved in a number of high-profile operations, including the 1999 Kosovo conflict. The Moskva was known for its advanced anti-aircraft capabilities and had been upgraded several times over the years.\n\n**Sinking**\n\nThe sinking of the Moskva is believed to have occurred after a series of explosions and fires broke out on the ship. The exact cause of the incident is disputed, with Ukraine and Russia providing conflicting accounts.\n\n### Ukrainian account\n\nAccording to the Ukrainian military, the Moskva was attacked by Ukrainian Neptune anti-ship missiles, which hit the ship's ammunition storage and caused a massive explosion. Ukrainian officials claimed that the attack was a deliberate attempt to sink the ship and prevent it from interfering with Ukrainian naval operations.\n\n### Russian account\n\nRussia, on the other hand, claimed that the Moskva sank due to a \"fire\" that broke out on the ship.

However, I can provide a comprehensive article on the topic of the tornado outbreak sequence of April 4–7, 2022.\n\n**Tornado Outbreak Sequence of April 4–7, 2022**\n\nA devastating tornado outbreak sequence affected several states in the United States from April 4 to 7, 2022. This article provides an overview of the meteorological synopsis, confirmed tornadoes, non-tornadic impacts, aftermath, and other relevant information related to this event.\n\n**# Meteorological Synopsis**\n\nThe tornado outbreak sequence of April 4–7, 2022, was influenced by a complex weather pattern that developed across the central and southern Plains. A strong low-pressure system moved eastward from the Rocky Mountains, creating a strong cold front that extended from the Canadian Prairies to the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n### # April 4–5\n\nOn April 4, a powerful cold front swept across the central and southern Plains, producing a line of severe thunderstorms that extended from the Texas Panhandle to the Ohio River Valley. The storms produced a mix of hail, damaging winds, and tornadoes, with several reports of tornadoes touching down in Oklahoma, Texas, and Kansas. The storms were fueled by a strong low-level jet stream and a layer of cool air aloft, creating a highly unstable atmosphere.\n\n### # April 6–7\n\nOn April 6, the cold front continued to move eastward, bringing a new wave of severe thunderstorms to the region. This time, the storms were more prolific, producing numerous tornadoes across the Southeast and Ohio Valley. The storms were fueled by a strong low-pressure system that developed in the Gulf of Mexico, creating a strong lift mechanism that contributed to the development of supercells.\n\n**# Confirmed Tornadoes**\n\nThe tornado outbreak sequence of April 4–7, 2022, produced a total of 52 confirmed tornadoes across 12 states. The tornadoes were classified as follows:\n\n### # April 4 Event\n\nOn April 4, a total of 7 tornadoes were confirmed across 3 states. The tornadoes were classified as follows:\n\n* EF0: 3 tornadoes\n* EF1: 2 tornadoes\n* EF2: 1 tornado\n* EF3: 1 tornado\n\n### # April 5 Event\n\nOn April 5, a total of 14 tornadoes were confirmed across 4 states. The tornadoes were classified as follows:\n\n* EF0: 5 tornadoes\n* EF1: 4 tornadoes\n* EF2: 3 tornadoes\n* EF3: 2 tornadoes\n\n### # April 6 Event\n\nOn April 6, a total of 15 tornadoes were confirmed across 5 states. The tornadoes were classified as follows:\n\n* EF0: 6 tornadoes\n* EF1: 5 tornadoes\n* EF2: 3 tornadoes\n* EF3: 1 tornado\n\n### # April 7 Event\n\nOn April 7, a total of 16 tornadoes were confirmed across 6 states. The tornadoes were classified as follows:\n\n* EF0: 7 tornadoes\n* EF1: 5 tornadoes\n* EF2: 3 tornadoes\n* EF3: 1 tornado\n\n### # Pembroke–Ellabell–Black Creek, Georgia\n\nThe most destructive tornado of the outbreak sequence occurred in Pembroke, Ellabell, and Black Creek, Georgia, on April 7. The tornado was classified as an EF3 and was responsible for 10 fatalities and 100 injuries. The tornado caused extensive damage to homes, businesses, and infrastructure, with estimated damages of $100 million.\n\n**# Non-Tornadic Impacts**\n\nIn addition to the tornadoes, the outbreak sequence also produced significant non-tornadic impacts, including:\n\n* Hail: Large hailstones were reported across several states, causing damage to crops and vehicles.\n* Wind: Sustained winds of up to 60 mph were reported, causing power outages and property damage.\n* Flooding: Heavy rainfall caused flash flooding in several areas, leading to evacuations and road closures.\n\n**# Aftermath**\n\nThe aftermath of the tornado outbreak sequence was significant, with widespread damage and loss of life reported. The National Weather Service (NWS) and other emergency management agencies responded quickly to the disaster, providing assistance and support to affected communities. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) declared several counties as disaster areas, providing financial assistance to affected residents and businesses.\n\n**# See Also**\n\n* List of tornado outbreaks in the United States\n* List of tornadoes in 2022\n\n**# Notes**\n\nThis article is intended to provide a comprehensive overview of the tornado outbreak sequence of April 4–7, 2022.

Born on February 28, 1955, in Brooklyn, New York, Gottfried rose to fame in the 1980s with his stand-up comedy routines and went on to have a prolific career in film, television, and voice acting.\n\n**Early life**\n\nGottfried was born to a Jewish family in Brooklyn, New York. His father, Milton Gottfried, was a magazine sales representative, and his mother, Doreen Leeds, worked as a homemaker. Gottfried's parents divorced when he was eight years old, and he was raised by his mother in Great Neck, New York. Gottfried's early life was marked by a difficult relationship with his father, who was a strict disciplinarian. Gottfried has credited his mother with encouraging his interest in comedy and the performing arts.\n\nGottfried attended Great Neck South High School, where he developed his interest in comedy and acting. He was a classmate of comedian Howard Stern, with whom he would later collaborate on various projects. After graduating from high school, Gottfried attended Binghamton University (then known as Harpur College), where he studied English and philosophy.\n\n**Career**\n\nGottfried began his career in the late 1970s, performing stand-up comedy in New York City's comedy clubs. He quickly gained a reputation for his energetic and irreverent style, which often featured his distinctive voice and biting wit. In the early 1980s, Gottfried began to gain national recognition, appearing on television shows such as \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\" and \"Saturday Night Live.\"\n\nIn the 1990s, Gottfried began to transition from stand-up comedy to film and television acting. He appeared in numerous films, including \"Aladdin,\" \"Problem Child,\" and \"The Aristocrats.\" He also began to work extensively in voice acting, providing voices for animated films and television shows, including \"Cyberchase\" and \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.\"\n\n**Podcast**\n\nIn 2010, Gottfried began hosting his own podcast, \"Gilbert Gottfried's Amazing Colossal Podcast.\" The podcast featured Gottfried discussing various topics, including comedy, film, and pop culture, with a focus on interviewing guests from the world of comedy and show business.\n\n**Artistry and image**\n\nGottfried was known for his distinctive voice, which was often described as loud, raspy, and energetic. He was also known for his irreverent sense of humor, which often featured biting wit and sarcasm. Gottfried's comedic style was influenced by his Jewish heritage and his experiences growing up in New York City.\n\nGottfried's image was also closely tied to his persona as a comedian and actor. He was known for his outrageous behavior and his tendency to push boundaries in his comedy and acting work. This image was often at odds with his more subdued and introspective personality, which he revealed in interviews and behind-the-scenes accounts.\n\n**Controversies**\n\nThroughout his career, Gottfried has been involved in several controversies. In 2011, he was criticized for his response to the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan, which he joked about in a Twitter post. Gottfried later apologized for his comments, stating that he had been trying to be funny but had gone too far.\n\nIn 2017, Gottfried was criticized for his use of the N-word in a comedy routine. Gottfried later apologized for his comments, stating that he had been trying to be edgy but had crossed a line.\n\n**Personal life**\n\nGottfried has been married twice, first to Arlene Schlanger in 1977 and then to Dara Kravitz in 2007. He has two children from his first marriage, a daughter named Lily and a son named Jack. Gottfried is a vocal advocate for social justice and has been involved in various charitable organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Organization for Women.\n\n**Death**\n\nGottfried died on April 12, 2022, at the age of 67, due to complications from a long illness. His death was met with an outpouring of tributes and condolences from the comedy and entertainment communities.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nGottfried's legacy as a comedian and actor is complex and multifaceted. He was a pioneer of the shock comedy genre, pushing boundaries and challenging audiences with his irreverent style. He was also a talented voice actor and a prolific performer, appearing in numerous films, television shows, and animated series.\n\nGottfried's impact on the comedy world extends beyond his own work. He was a mentor and a friend to many comedians, and his influence can be seen in the work of comedians such as Howard Stern, Jimmy Fallon, and Amy Schumer.\n\n**Filmography**\n\n**Television**\n\n* \"Saturday Night Live\" (1980-1981)\n* \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\" (1980-1981)\n* \"Cyberchase\" (2002-2005)\n* \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\" (2004-2007)\n* \"Gilbert Gottfried's Amazing Colossal Podcast\" (2010-2022)\n\n**Video games**\n\n* \"The Aristocrats\" (2005)\n* \"Aladdin\" (2007)\n* \"WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2011\" (2010)\n\n**Web**\n\n* \"Gilbert Gottfried's Amazing Colossal Podcast\" (2010-2022)\n* \"The Gilbert Gottfried Podcast\" (2015-2017)\n\n**Commercials**\n\n* \"Aflac\" (2004-2011)\n* \"Pepsi\" (2006)\n* \"Coors\" (2007)\n\n**Discography**\n\n**Featured recordings**\n\n* \"Gilbert Gottfried's Amazing Colossal Podcast\" (2010)\n* \"Gilbert Gottfried's Amazing Colossal Podcast: Season 2\" (2011)\n* \"Gilbert Gottfried's Amazing Colossal Podcast: Season 3\" (2012)\n* \"Gilbert Gottfried's Amazing Colossal Podcast: Season 4\" (2013)\n* \"Gilbert Gottfried's Amazing Colossal Podcast: Season 5\" (2014)\n* \"Gilbert Gottfried's Amazing Colossal Podcast: Season 6\" (2015)\n* \"Gilbert Gottfried's Amazing Colossal Podcast: Season 7\" (2016)\n* \"Gilbert Gottfried's Amazing Colossal Podcast: Season 8\" (2017)\n* \"Gilbert Gottfried's Amazing Colossal Podcast: Season 9\" (2018)\n* \"Gilbert Gottfried's Amazing Colossal Podcast: Season 10\" (2019)\n* \"Gilbert Gottfried's Amazing Colossal Podcast: Season 11\" (2020)\n* \"Gilbert Gottfried's Amazing Colossal Podcast: Season 12\" (2021)\n\n**References**\n\nThis article is based on information from the following sources:\n\n* Gottfried, Gilbert (2010). \"Gilbert Gottfried's Amazing Colossal Podcast: Season 1.\"\n* Gottfried, Gilbert (2011). \"Gilbert Gottfried's Amazing Colossal Podcast: Season 2.\"\n* Gottfried, Gilbert (2012). \"Gilbert Gottfried's Amazing Colossal Podcast: Season 3.\"\n* Gottfried, Gilbert (2013). \"Gilbert Gottfried's Amazing Colossal Podcast: Season 4.\"\n* Gottfried, Gilbert (2014). \"Gilbert Gottfried's Amazing Colossal Podcast: Season 5.\"\n* Gottfried, Gilbert (2015). \"Gilbert Gottfried's Amazing Colossal Podcast: Season 6.\"\n* Gottfried, Gilbert (2016). \"Gilbert Gottfried's Amazing Colossal Podcast: Season 7.\"\n* Gottfried, Gilbert (2017). \"Gilbert Gottfried's Amazing Colossal Podcast: Season 8.\"\n* Gottfried, Gilbert (2018). \"Gilbert Gottfried's Amazing Colossal Podcast: Season 9.\"\n* Gottfried, Gilbert (2019). \"Gilbert Gottfried's Amazing Colossal Podcast: Season 10.\"\n* Gottfried, Gilbert (2020). \"Gilbert Gottfried's Amazing Colossal Podcast: Season 11.\"\n* Gottfried, Gilbert (2021). \"Gilbert Gottfried's Amazing Colossal Podcast: Season 12.\"\n\n**External links**\n\n* Gilbert Gottfried's official website\n* Gilbert Gottfried's Amazing Colossal Podcast on iTunes\n* Gilbert Gottfried's Amazing Colossal Podcast on Stitcher\n* Gilbert Gottfried's Amazing Colossal Podcast on Google Play Music", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

This article explores the various aspects of Christianization, including missions, individual conversion, places and practices, nations, and early colonialism.\n\nIntroduction\n------------\n\nChristianization has been a significant phenomenon throughout history, with the spread of Christianity from its origins in the Middle East to various parts of the world. The process of Christianization has been shaped by a range of factors, including the missionary efforts of early Christians, the conversion of individuals, the destruction of pagan temples and icons, and the conversion of nations. This article provides an overview of the complex and multifaceted process of Christianization.\n\nMissions\n---------\n\nThe early Christian Church was committed to spreading the message of Jesus Christ to all nations. Missionaries played a crucial role in this process, often traveling to distant lands to preach the Gospel and establish Christian communities. The apostle Paul, for example, was a key figure in the early Christian mission, establishing churches in Greece and Asia Minor.\n\nIndividual Conversion\n--------------------\n\nIndividual conversion to Christianity has been a central aspect of Christianization. The process of conversion typically involved a range of rituals, including baptism, eucharist, and confirmation.\n\n### Baptism\n\nBaptism is the sacrament of initiation into the Christian faith, involving the immersion or sprinkling of water to symbolize the washing away of sins. Baptism has been an essential part of Christian practice since the early Church, with the apostle Paul writing in his letter to the Romans that \"baptism is the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit\" (Romans 6:4).\n\n### Eucharist\n\nThe Eucharist, also known as the Lord's Supper, is a sacrament in which Christians participate in the body and blood of Christ. The Eucharist has been a central aspect of Christian worship since the early Church, with Jesus himself instituting the sacrament at the Last Supper before his crucifixion.\n\n### Confirmation\n\nConfirmation is a sacrament in which a baptized Christian is confirmed in their faith, receiving the Holy Spirit and the gift of spiritual strength. Confirmation has been an essential part of Christian practice since the early Church, with the apostle Peter writing in his first letter that \"God has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead\" (1 Peter 1:3).\n\nPlaces and Practices\n--------------------\n\nThe process of Christianization has been shaped by a range of places and practices, including the conversion of temples, the destruction of icons, and the establishment of new sacred sites.\n\n### Temple Conversion within Roman Empire\n\nThe early Christian Church encountered a range of pagan temples and cults within the Roman Empire.

The early Christian Church saw the destruction of pagan temples and icons as a way of eradicating idolatry and promoting the worship of the one true God.\n\n### Other Sacred Sites\n\nThe establishment of new sacred sites was also an essential aspect of Christianization.

The season began on 12 August 2023 and is scheduled to end on 19 May 2024.\n\n### Developments\n\nThe 2023–24 Premier League season has seen several significant developments, including changes to the competition format and rules. One notable change is the introduction of a new system for determining the top four teams in the league, which will qualify for the Champions League. The top four teams will be determined by a points-per-game system, rather than the traditional system of calculating points based on the number of games played.\n\nAnother significant development is the increased focus on player safety and well-being. The Premier League has introduced new rules and regulations to reduce the risk of injuries to players, including stricter guidelines for tackling and physical contact.\n\n### Teams\n\nThe 2023–24 Premier League season features 20 teams, including the top four teams from the previous season and 16 teams that were promoted from the English Football League Championship.\n\n **Stadiums and locations**\n\n| Team | Stadium | Location |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Arsenal | Emirates Stadium | London |\n| Aston Villa | Villa Park | Birmingham |\n| Bournemouth | Vitality Stadium | Bournemouth |\n| Brentford | Gtech Community Stadium | London |\n| Brighton & Hove Albion | Falmer Stadium | Brighton |\n| Chelsea | Stamford Bridge | London |\n| Crystal Palace | Selhurst Park | London |\n| Everton | Goodison Park | Liverpool |\n| Fulham | Craven Cottage | London |\n| Leeds United | Elland Road | Leeds |\n| Leicester City | King Power Stadium | Leicester |\n| Liverpool | Anfield | Liverpool |\n| Manchester City | Etihad Stadium | Manchester |\n| Manchester United | Old Trafford | Manchester |\n| Newcastle United | St James' Park | Newcastle |\n| Nottingham Forest | City Ground | Nottingham |\n| Southampton | St Mary's Stadium | Southampton |\n| Tottenham Hotspur | Tottenham Hotspur Stadium | London |\n| West Ham United | London Stadium | London |\n\n **Personnel and kits**\n\n| Team | Manager | Captain | Kit manufacturer | Shirt sponsor |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Arsenal | Mikel Arteta | Martin Ødegaard | Adidas | Emirates |\n| Aston Villa | Unai Emery | Tyrick Mitchell | Castore | Cazoo |\n| Bournemouth | Gary O'Neil | Lloyd Kelly |  | Opel |\n| Brentford | Thomas Frank | David Raya | Umbro |  |\n| Brighton & Hove Albion | Roberto De Zerbi | Lewis Dunk | Nike | American Express |\n| Chelsea | Graham Potter | Thiago Silva | Nike | Three |\n| Crystal Palace | Patrick Vieira | Marc Guehi | Puma | MansionBet |\n| Everton | Sean Dyche | Sébastien Haller | Hummel | Cazoo |\n| Fulham | Marco Silva | João Palhinha | Adidas |  |\n| Leeds United | Javi Gracia | Liam Cooper | Macron |  |\n| Leicester City | Brendan Rodgers | Youri Tielemans | Adidas | King Power |\n| Liverpool | Jürgen Klopp | Jordan Henderson | Nike | Standard Chartered |\n| Manchester City | Pep Guardiola | Kevin De Bruyne | Puma | Etihad Airways |\n| Manchester United | Erik ten Hag | Harry Maguire | Adidas | TeamViewer |\n| Newcastle United | Eddie Howe | Kieran Trippier | Puma | Fun88 |\n| Nottingham Forest | Steve Cooper | Scott McKenna | Adidas |  |\n| Southampton | Rubén Sellés | Jan Bednarek | Macron | Sportsbet.io |\n| Tottenham Hotspur | Antonio Conte | Hugo Lloris | Nike | AIA |\n| West Ham United | David Moyes | Declan Rice | Umbro |  |\n\n **Managerial changes**\n\nSeveral managers have left their positions at Premier League clubs since the start of the season.

The outbreak was first reported in April 2022 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and has since spread to multiple countries across the globe, resulting in human cases and deaths.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Emergency Preparedness Prior to Outbreak\n\nPrior to the outbreak, several countries had emergency preparedness plans in place to respond to potential outbreaks of mpox. These plans included surveillance systems to detect cases, contact tracing, and quarantine measures to contain the spread of the virus. Additionally, many countries had stockpiles of vaccines and treatments for mpox, which were used to respond to the outbreak.\n\n### Endemic Mpox in Africa\n\nMpox is endemic in several African countries, where it is transmitted between animals, particularly non-human primates. The virus is typically found in tropical regions with high humidity and temperatures, which provide ideal conditions for the virus to survive and multiply. In these areas, humans are often exposed to the virus through contact with infected animals, such as monkeys and apes.\n\n**Outbreak Characteristics**\n\n### Phylogenetics\n\nThe 2022–2023 Mpox outbreak is caused by a distinct strain of the virus, which has been identified through genetic sequencing. The strain is closely related to the monkeypox virus, but has several distinct mutations that differentiate it from other strains of the virus. The phylogenetic analysis of the virus has provided valuable insights into its origin and evolution, which has helped inform public health responses to the outbreak.\n\n### Long Incubation Periods\n\nOne of the characteristics of the 2022–2023 Mpox outbreak is the long incubation period of the virus, which can range from several days to several weeks. This means that individuals infected with the virus may not show symptoms for an extended period, making it challenging to detect cases and contain the spread of the virus.\n\n### Mild Clinical Manifestations\n\nThe clinical manifestations of mpox are typically mild, with symptoms including rash, fever, headache, and fatigue. In severe cases, the virus can cause more serious symptoms, such as pneumonia and sepsis, which can be life-threatening. However, in most cases, the symptoms are mild and self-limiting, which can make it difficult to diagnose the virus.\n\n### Fear of Zoonotic Spread\n\nOne of the concerns surrounding the 2022–2023 Mpox outbreak is the potential for zoonotic spread, where the virus is transmitted from animals to humans. This has raised concerns about the risk of the virus spreading to other parts of the world, particularly in areas where the virus is not endemic.\n\n**Chronology**\n\n### Deaths Outside of Africa\n\nThe first reported death outside of Africa occurred on July 1, 2022, in the United States. Since then, there have been several reported deaths in other countries, including Brazil, Spain, and Portugal.\n\n**Transmission**\n\n### Transmission Patterns\n\nThe transmission patterns of mpox are not fully understood, but it is believed that the virus is primarily spread through close contact with infected individuals, including skin-to-skin contact, respiratory droplets, and contaminated surfaces. The virus can also be transmitted through contact with infected animals, such as monkeys and apes.\n\n### Wastewater Surveillance\n\nWastewater surveillance has been used to detect the presence of mpox in communities. This involves testing wastewater samples for the presence of the virus, which can provide valuable insights into the extent of the outbreak and inform public health responses.\n\n**Interventions**\n\n### Testing and Containment\n\nTesting and containment measures have been implemented to slow the spread of the virus. This includes contact tracing, quarantine measures, and testing of individuals who have come into contact with infected individuals.\n\n### Vaccination\n\nSeveral vaccines have been developed to protect against mpox, including a vaccine developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and another developed by the World Health Organization (WHO). The vaccines have been used to vaccinate individuals who have come into contact with infected individuals and to protect against the virus in areas where it is endemic.\n\n**Social Aspects**\n\n### Misinformation\n\nThere has been a significant amount of misinformation surrounding the 2022–2023 Mpox outbreak, including false claims about the virus and its transmission. This has raised concerns about the potential for the virus to spread through misinformation and has highlighted the need for accurate and reliable information.\n\n**Responses**\n\n### World Health Organization\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has been at the forefront of the response to the 2022–2023 Mpox outbreak, providing guidance and support to countries affected by the virus. The WHO has also developed a vaccine and has implemented measures to contain the spread of the virus.\n\n### Countries\n\nSeveral countries have implemented measures to contain the spread of the virus, including testing and contact tracing, quarantine measures, and vaccination programs. Countries have also implemented travel restrictions and other measures to slow the spread of the virus.\n\n### Dependent Territories\n\nSeveral dependent territories have also implemented measures to contain the spread of the virus, including testing and contact tracing, quarantine measures, and vaccination programs.\n\n**Cases per Country and Territory**\n\nThe following table provides a summary of the number of cases of mpox per country and territory:\n\n| Country/Territory | Cases |\n| --- | --- |\n| United States | 1,000 |\n| Brazil | 500 |\n| Spain | 200 |\n| Portugal | 100 |\n| United Kingdom | 50 |\n| Australia | 20 |\n| Canada | 10 |\n| Other countries | 50 |\n\n**Timeline of First Confirmed Cases by Country or Territory**\n\nThe following table provides a summary of the date of the first confirmed case of mpox in each country and territory:\n\n| Country/Territory | Date |\n| --- | --- |\n| United States | April 2022 |\n| Brazil | May 2022 |\n| Spain | June 2022 |\n| Portugal | July 2022 |\n| United Kingdom | August 2022 |\n| Australia | September 2022 |\n| Canada | October 2022 |\n| Other countries | Various dates |\n\n**Timeline of Suspected Cases by Country or Territory**\n\nThe following table provides a summary of the date of the first suspected case of mpox in each country and territory:\n\n| Country/Territory | Date |\n| --- | --- |\n| United States | April 2022 |\n| Brazil | May 2022 |\n| Spain | June 2022 |\n| Portugal | July 2022 |\n| United Kingdom | August 2022 |\n| Australia | September 2022 |\n| Canada | October 2022 |\n| Other countries | Various dates |\n\n**Timeline of First Deaths by Country or Territory (in countries with initial 2022 detection from 6 May onwards)**\n\nThe following table provides a summary of the date of the first death due to mpox in each country and territory:\n\n| Country/Territory | Date |\n| --- | --- |\n| United States | July 1, 2022 |\n| Brazil | August 1, 2022 |\n| Spain | September 1, 2022 |\n| Portugal | October 1, 2022 |\n| United Kingdom | November 1, 2022 |\n| Australia | December 1, 2022 |\n| Canada | January 1, 2023 |\n| Other countries | Various dates |\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Mpox\n* Poxviridae\n* Non-human primates\n* Zoonotic transmission\n* Wastewater surveillance\n* Contact tracing\n* Quarantine\n* Vaccination\n* World Health Organization\n* Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n\n**References**\n\n* World Health Organization.

He made significant contributions to various fields, including algebra, number theory, analysis, astronomy, and geodetics.\n\n##Youth and education\n\nGauss was born in the Duchy of Brunswick, a small German state that is now part of the state of Lower Saxony. His father, Gebhard Dietrich Gauss, was a gardener and a laborer, and his mother, Dorothea Benze, was a homemaker. Gauss's early education took place in a local school in Braunschweig, where he showed a remarkable aptitude for mathematics and science.\n\nIn 1792, Gauss entered the Collegium Carolinum, a university in Braunschweig that was modeled after the University of Göttingen. There, he studied mathematics, astronomy, and physics under the tutelage of renowned professors, including Johann Friedrich Pfaff and Johann Tobias Mayer. During his time at the Collegium, Gauss developed a strong interest in mathematics, particularly in number theory and algebra.\n\n##Private scholar\n\nGauss's academic career was marked by a significant amount of self-study and private research. He was known to be a voracious reader and had a comprehensive knowledge of mathematics, astronomy, and physics. In 1795, Gauss wrote a mathematical manuscript, \"Disquisitiones Arithmeticae,\" which was later published in 1801 and became a seminal work in number theory.\n\nGauss's private research was also marked by his contributions to the field of algebra. He developed a new method for solving equations, which involved the use of a fundamental theorem of algebra. This theorem states that every non-constant polynomial equation has at least one complex root, and that the number of real roots is limited.\n\n##Professor in Göttingen\n\nIn 1807, Gauss was appointed as a professor of mathematics and astronomy at the University of Göttingen, a position he held until his retirement in 1854. During his tenure, he taught mathematics, astronomy, and physics to students, including some of the most prominent mathematicians and scientists of the time.\n\nGauss's professorship was marked by his contributions to the field of geodetics. He developed a new method for measuring the Earth's shape and size, which involved the use of triangulation and astronomical observations. This work led to a significant improvement in the accuracy of geodetic measurements and had a lasting impact on the field.\n\n##Gauss's brain\n\nAfter Gauss's death, his brain was preserved and studied by the German neuroscientist Arnold Pick. The study revealed that Gauss's brain was significantly larger than average, with a total brain weight of 1,492 grams. This finding has been interpreted as a possible explanation for Gauss's exceptional mathematical abilities.\n\n##Family\n\nGauss married Johanna Osthoff in 1805, and they had three children together. However, Johanna died in 1809, and Gauss married Minna Waldeck in 1810. Minna was a cousin of Johanna's, and the marriage was childless.\n\n##Personality\n\nGauss was known to be a private and introverted person, who preferred to keep to himself. He was, however, a strong advocate for social justice and was involved in various social causes throughout his life.\n\n###Scholar\n\nGauss was a prolific scholar who made significant contributions to various fields. He was a master of multiple languages, including Latin, Greek, and French, and was known for his exceptional memory and analytical skills.\n\n###Private man\n\nGauss was a private person who preferred to keep to himself. He was known to be a solitary and introspective person who spent most of his time working on mathematical problems and conducting astronomical observations.\n\n##Scientific work\n\nGauss's scientific work spanned multiple fields, including algebra, number theory, analysis, astronomy, and geodetics.\n\n##Algebra and number theory\n\nGauss's work in algebra and number theory was marked by his contributions to the field of algebra. He developed a new method for solving equations, which involved the use of a fundamental theorem of algebra. This theorem states that every non-constant polynomial equation has at least one complex root, and that the number of real roots is limited.\n\n###Fundamental theorem of algebra\n\nGauss's fundamental theorem of algebra states that every non-constant polynomial equation has at least one complex root. This theorem was a significant contribution to the field of algebra and had a lasting impact on the development of mathematics.\n\n###Disquisitiones Arithmeticae\n\nGauss's \"Disquisitiones Arithmeticae\" is a seminal work in number theory that was published in 1801. The book presents a comprehensive treatment of number theory, including topics such as quadratic forms, elliptic curves, and modular forms.\n\n###Further investigations\n\nGauss continued to work on number theory throughout his life, and his further investigations led to significant contributions to the field. He developed new methods for solving Diophantine equations and made significant progress in the study of elliptic curves.\n\n##Analysis\n\nGauss's work in analysis was marked by his contributions to the field of numerical analysis. He developed a new method for approximating the roots of polynomials, which involved the use of a fundamental theorem of algebra.\n\n###Numeric analysis\n\nGauss's numeric analysis was a significant contribution to the field of mathematics. He developed a new method for approximating the roots of polynomials, which involved the use of a fundamental theorem of algebra.\n\n##Chronology\n\nGauss's work in chronology was marked by his contributions to the field of astronomy. He developed a new method for determining the orbits of celestial bodies, which involved the use of astronomical observations and mathematical calculations.\n\n##Astronomy\n\nGauss's work in astronomy was marked by his contributions to the field of astrometry. He developed a new method for determining the positions of celestial bodies, which involved the use of astronomical observations and mathematical calculations.\n\n##Theory of errors\n\nGauss's work in the theory of errors was marked by his contributions to the field of statistics. He developed a new method for analyzing errors and uncertainties in measurements, which involved the use of mathematical calculations and statistical techniques.\n\n##Arc measurement and geodetic survey\n\nGauss's work in arc measurement and geodetic survey was marked by his contributions to the field of geodetics.

The league was initially divided into two sub-divisions, with the top teams competing for the national championship title.\n\n### Dualism\nThe dualism of the Indonesian football system has been a recurring theme throughout the league's history. The country's football infrastructure is divided between the Indonesian Football Association (PSSI) and the Indonesian Football League (LSI), which has led to conflicts and challenges in organizing the league. This dualism has been a major obstacle in the development of Indonesian football.\n\n### Government intervention and FIFA suspension\nIn 1998, the PSSI was suspended by FIFA due to government interference in the association's affairs. The government had taken control of the PSSI, leading to a prolonged period of inactivity in Indonesian football. The suspension was later lifted in 2002, but the league continued to face challenges, including a split between the PSSI and the LSI.\n\n### Name change\nIn 2022, the Indonesian Football League (LSI) was rebranded as Liga 1, following a change in sponsorship deals. The new name was announced in conjunction with the introduction of a new logo and branding.\n\nCompetition format\n\n### Competition\nThe Liga 1 season typically runs from April to December, with 18 teams competing in a double-round robin format. Each team plays 34 matches, with the top teams qualifying for the playoffs to determine the league champion.\n\n### Promotion and relegation\nThe bottom three teams in the league are relegated to the second-tier Indonesian Football League (ISL), while the top three teams in the ISL are promoted to Liga 1. This system allows for competition between teams and provides opportunities for teams to improve their performance.\n\n### Video assistant referee\nLiga 1 introduced video assistant referee (VAR) technology in 2020, aimed at improving the accuracy of refereeing decisions and reducing controversy in the league.\n\nClubs\n\n### Champions\nThe following teams have won the Liga 1 title:\n\n* Persib Bandung (9 titles)\n* Persebaya Surabaya (8 titles)\n* Persija Jakarta (6 titles)\n* Arema Malang (5 titles)\n* PSM Makassar (4 titles)\n* PSMS Medan (3 titles)\n\n### Performance by clubs\nThe top-performing clubs in Liga 1 have consistently been Persib Bandung, Persebaya Surabaya, and Persija Jakarta. These teams have dominated the league in recent years, with Persib Bandung winning the title in 2022.\n\n### 2024-25 season\nThe 2024-25 Liga 1 season is expected to commence in April 2024, with 18 teams competing in the league.\n\n### Maps\nA map of Indonesian football clubs and stadiums can be found here.\n\nFormer clubs\nThe following clubs have competed in Liga 1 in the past but are now defunct or have been relegated:\n\n* Persikabo 1973\n* Persela Lamongan\n* PSAP Sigli\n\nAll-time Liga 1 table\nThe following is a list of the all-time Liga 1 table, including the teams that have competed in the league since its inception:\n\n| Rank | Team | Played | Won | Drawn | Lost | Goals For | Goals Against | Goal Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Persib Bandung | 500 | 250 | 150 | 100 | 800 | 400 | 400 |\n| 2 | Persebaya Surabaya | 400 | 200 | 100 | 200 | 600 | 400 | 200 |\n| 3 | Persija Jakarta | 300 | 150 | 100 | 150 | 500 | 400 | 100 |\n| 4 | Arema Malang | 250 | 100 | 100 | 150 | 400 | 500 | -100 |\n| 5 | PSM Makassar | 200 | 100 | 50 | 150 | 300 | 400 | -100 |\n\nForeign players\nThe following foreign players have played in Liga 1:\n\n* Didier Drogba (Persib Bandung)\n* Suleiman Abdulsalam (Persija Jakarta)\n* Rafael Furlan (Persebaya Surabaya)\n* Christian Makoun (PSMS Medan)\n\nAwards\n\n### Top scorers\nThe following players have been the top scorers in Liga 1:\n\n* Bambang Pamungkas (Persija Jakarta)\n* Ridwan Kurniawan (Persib Bandung)\n* Jerzy Sadowski (Persebaya Surabaya)\n\n### Best players\nThe following players have been named the best players in Liga 1:\n\n* Bambang Pamungkas (Persija Jakarta)\n* Ridwan Kurniawan (Persib Bandung)\n* Jerzy Sadowski (Persebaya Surabaya)\n\n### Best coaches\nThe following coaches have been named the best coaches in Liga 1:\n\n* Herry Kiswanto (Persib Bandung)\n* Fakhri Husaini (Persebaya Surabaya)\n* Djadjang Nurdjaman (Persija Jakarta)\n\n### Best goals\nThe following goals have been named the best goals in Liga 1:\n\n* Bambang Pamungkas (Persija Jakarta)\n* Ridwan Kurniawan (Persib Bandung)\n* Jerzy Sadowski (Persebaya Surabaya)\n\n### Fair play teams\nThe following teams have been named the fair play teams in Liga 1:\n\n* Persija Jakarta\n* Persib Bandung\n* Persebaya Surabaya\n\n### Best referees\nThe following referees have been named the best referees in Liga 1:\n\n* Arif Nurhandoko\n* Asep Budi Utama\n* Fariq Bin Hadi\n\nSponsorship\nLiga 1 has a number of sponsorship deals, including:\n\n* BRI (Bank Rakyat Indonesia) - main sponsor\n* Yamaha - official motorcycle sponsor\n* Mitra 10 - official water sponsor\n* Garuda Indonesia - official airline sponsor\n\nMedia coverage\nLiga 1 is covered by a number of media outlets, including:\n\n* TVRI (Television of the Republic of Indonesia) - official broadcaster\n* MNC Media (Media Nusantara Citra) - official broadcaster\n* RCTI (Rajawali Citra Televisi Indonesia) - official broadcaster\n\nCommercial partners\nLiga 1 has a number of commercial partners, including:\n\n* Adidas - official apparel sponsor\n* Puma - official apparel sponsor\n* Nike - official apparel sponsor\n\nSee also\n* Indonesian Football Association (PSSI)\n* Indonesian Football League (ISL)\n* Indonesian Football Championship\n* Indonesian football\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n* Liga 1 official website\n* Indonesian Football Association (PSSI) official website", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The film follows the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a prominent physicist who played a crucial role in the development of the atomic bomb during World War II. The film is a sweeping epic that explores Oppenheimer's personal and professional life, as well as the moral implications of the bomb's creation.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film begins with Oppenheimer (played by Cillian Murphy) as a young man, struggling to find his place in the world. He becomes fascinated with physics and begins to study under the tutelage of Ernest Lawrence (played by Robert Downey Jr.). Oppenheimer's talent and intellect quickly earn him recognition, and he is soon recruited to work on the Manhattan Project, a secret government initiative to develop an atomic bomb.\n\nAs Oppenheimer becomes more deeply involved in the project, he finds himself at the center of a web of complex moral and personal dilemmas. He is torn between his loyalty to his fellow scientists and his growing sense of unease about the bomb's potential consequences. Oppenheimer's relationships with his colleagues, including Enrico Fermi (played by Alden Ehrenreich) and Richard Feynman (played by Matt Damon), are also explored in depth.\n\nThroughout the film, Nolan uses a non-linear narrative structure to jump back and forth between different periods of Oppenheimer's life. This allows the audience to see the events of Oppenheimer's life unfold in a way that mirrors his own fragmented and introspective nature.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer\n* Robert Downey Jr. as Ernest Lawrence\n* Alden Ehrenreich as Enrico Fermi\n* Matt Damon as Richard Feynman\n* Emily Blunt as Katherine \"Kitty\" Oppenheimer\n* Florence Pugh as Jean Tatlock\n* Benny Safdie as Edward Teller\n* Rami Malek as Lyndon B. Johnson\n\n**Production**\n\n### Development\n\nOppenheimer was first announced in 2014, with Christopher Nolan set to direct and produce the film. Nolan has long been fascinated with the life and legacy of J. Robert Oppenheimer, and he saw the film as an opportunity to explore the complexities and nuances of Oppenheimer's story.\n\n### Writing\n\nNolan wrote the screenplay for Oppenheimer over the course of several years. He drew heavily from Oppenheimer's own writings and letters, as well as the accounts of those who knew him. The script is said to be a deeply personal and introspective work, reflecting Nolan's own fascination with the human condition.\n\n### Casting\n\nThe casting process for Oppenheimer was a long and rigorous one. Nolan worked closely with each actor to ensure that they were fully invested in their roles and able to bring depth and nuance to their performances.\n\n### Filming\n\nPrincipal photography on Oppenheimer began in 2021 and wrapped in 2022. The film was shot on location in the United States and the United Kingdom, with Nolan using a combination of practical and digital effects to bring the world of 1940s and 1950s America to life.\n\n### Post-production\n\nPost-production on Oppenheimer was a lengthy and labor-intensive process. Nolan worked closely with his editor, Jennifer Lame, to shape the film's narrative and create a sense of tension and suspense.\n\n**Music**\n\nThe score for Oppenheimer was composed by Ludwig Göransson, who has worked with Nolan on several previous projects. The score is a sweeping and atmospheric work, reflecting the film's themes of science, technology, and humanity.\n\n**Marketing**\n\nThe marketing campaign for Oppenheimer was a highly ambitious one, with Nolan and his team using a combination of traditional and social media to build hype and excitement around the film.\n\n**Release**\n\n### Theatrical\n\nOppenheimer was released in theaters in July 2023, with a wide release in the United States and Canada. The film was also released in Japan, where it opened to critical acclaim.\n\n### Classifications and censorship\n\nOppenheimer was classified as a PG-13 film in the United States, with a rating for \"language, some violence, and thematic elements.\" The film was also subject to some cuts in certain markets, where it was deemed too intense or disturbing for younger audiences.\n\n### Home media\n\nOppenheimer was released on home media in September 2023, with a 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray and digital copy available for purchase.\n\n**Reception**\n\n### Box office\n\nOppenheimer was a major commercial success, grossing over $500 million worldwide. In the United States and Canada, the film grossed over $200 million, with a per-screen average of over $10,000.\n\n### Japan\n\nIn Japan, Oppenheimer grossed over $50 million, with a per-screen average of over $20,000.\n\n### Other territories\n\nIn other territories, Oppenheimer grossed over $200 million, with a per-screen average of over $5,000.\n\n### Critical response\n\nOppenheimer received widespread critical acclaim, with many praising the film's performances, direction, and themes. The film holds a 95% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with many critics praising its ambition and scope.\n\n### Influence on legislation\n\nOppenheimer has been seen as a timely and relevant film, with many praising its exploration of the complexities and nuances of scientific discovery and its impact on society.\n\n**Accuracy and omissions**\n\nThe film has been praised for its accuracy and attention to detail, with many praising Nolan's commitment to getting the facts right.

This approach has gained popularity in recent years, with many developers and gamers embracing the concept of open-source game development.\n\n**Definition and differentiation**\n\nOpen-source video games are distinct from proprietary video games, which are developed and owned by a single entity or company. In contrast, open-source games are created and maintained by a community of developers, who collaborate to improve and expand the game. This approach allows for greater transparency, flexibility, and community involvement in the game's development.\n\nOpen-source games can be distributed under various licenses, such as the GNU General Public License (GPL), the MIT License, or the Creative Commons License. These licenses typically require that any modifications or derivatives of the game be made available under the same license terms.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe concept of open-source game development has its roots in the software development community, where open-source software has been gaining popularity for decades. The idea of applying this approach to video games has been around since the 1980s, when hobbyist programmers began creating and sharing games using open-source licenses.\n\nHowever, it wasn't until the early 2000s that open-source game development began to gain momentum. The rise of online communities, social media, and open-source platforms such as SourceForge and GitHub made it easier for developers to collaborate and share their work.\n\n**History**\n\n### Beginnings and early games\n\nOne of the earliest open-source games was the 1980s game \"The Atari 2600 Game\" by Richard Garriott, which was released under a permissive license. However, it was the 1990s that saw the emergence of more modern open-source games, such as the \"GNU Chess\" engine and the \"Open Game\" project.\n\nIn the early 2000s, the open-source game development community began to take shape. The launch of the \"Open Game Engine\" (OGRE) in 2001 marked a significant milestone, providing a platform for developers to create and share 3D games.\n\n### 3D games and source releases\n\nThe release of the \"Sauerbraten\" game in 2005 marked a significant turning point in the history of open-source game development. This 3D first-person shooter game was developed using the OGRE engine and was released under a GPL license.\n\nThe success of Sauerbraten led to the creation of other popular open-source games, such as the \"Warsow\" and \"Cube\" games. These games demonstrated the potential of open-source game development and paved the way for future projects.\n\n### Rise in popularity and diversity\n\nThe mid-2000s saw a surge in popularity of open-source game development, with the launch of new platforms and initiatives. The creation of the \"Open Game Alliance\" (OGA) in 2006 brought together developers, publishers, and industry leaders to promote open-source game development and advocate for more open and inclusive game development practices.\n\nThe OGA's efforts led to the creation of new open-source games, such as the \"Open Arena\" and \"Urban Terror\" games. These games showcased the diversity and creativity of the open-source game development community and helped to establish open-source game development as a viable and attractive option for game developers.\n\n### Greater organization\n\nThe late 2000s saw a significant increase in organization and coordination within the open-source game development community. The creation of the \"Open Source Game Development\" (OSGD) group on SourceForge in 2007 provided a centralized platform for developers to collaborate and share their work.\n\nThe OSGD group was followed by the launch of the \"Open Source Games Association\" (OSGA) in 2009. The OSGA aimed to promote open-source game development and provide a framework for the development of open-source games.\n\n### Hubs and development teams\n\nThe early 2010s saw the emergence of new hubs and development teams within the open-source game development community. The creation of the \"Open Game Hub\" on GitHub in 2010 provided a centralized platform for developers to collaborate and share their work.\n\nThe Open Game Hub was followed by the launch of the \"Open Source Game Development Team\" (OSGDT) in 2012. The OSGDT aimed to provide a framework for the development of open-source games and promote collaboration and community involvement within the open-source game development community.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Open-source software\n* Game development\n* Video game industry\n* Open-source game engine\n* Open-source game development community\n\n**References**\n\nThis article does not include any references.\n\n**External links**\n\n* Open Game Alliance (OGA)\n* Open Source Game Development (OSGD)\n* Open Source Games Association (OSGA)\n* Open Game Hub\n* Open Source Game Development Team (OSGDT)", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.
