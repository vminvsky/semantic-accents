This can be achieved through a variety of methods, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, enhancing carbon sinks, and promoting sustainable development.\n\n**Relationship with Solar Radiation Modification (SRM)**\n\nSolar radiation modification (SRM) is a technique that aims to reduce the amount of solar radiation that enters the Earth's atmosphere, thereby cooling the planet. While SRM is a potential method for mitigating climate change, it is still a highly debated and experimental approach. Some researchers believe that SRM could be used as a complement to other mitigation strategies, but others argue that it could have unintended consequences and may not be a viable solution on its own.\n\n**Emission Trends and Pledges**\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions have been increasing rapidly over the past century, driven by the growing demand for energy, transportation, and other activities. To mitigate climate change, it is essential to reduce these emissions to net zero by the second half of this century. The Paris Agreement, signed by nearly 200 countries in 2015, sets a global goal to limit warming to well below 2°C and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.\n\n**Needed Emissions Cuts**\n\nTo achieve the Paris Agreement goals, it is estimated that global emissions need to be cut by 45% by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050. This requires a rapid transition to low-carbon energy, electrification of transportation, and increased energy efficiency. It also involves reducing non-energy emissions, such as from agriculture and land use, and removing CO2 from the atmosphere through carbon capture and storage (CCS) and afforestation.\n\n**Pledges**\n\nCountries have made various pledges to reduce their emissions, but these commitments are often inadequate and lack detail. Many countries have set national targets, but these are not always aligned with the Paris Agreement goals. Some countries, such as Norway and Sweden, have made significant progress in reducing emissions, while others, such as the United States and Australia, have rolled back climate policies and increased emissions.\n\n**Low-Carbon Energy**\n\nLow-carbon energy is essential for mitigating climate change. This includes solar, wind, hydro, and other renewable energy sources that can reduce dependence on fossil fuels and lower emissions. **Solar and Wind Energy** are becoming increasingly cost-competitive with fossil fuels and are being deployed at a rapid pace. **Other Renewables**, such as hydroelectric power and geothermal energy, also play an important role in the transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\n**Integrating Variable Renewable Energy**\n\nVariable renewable energy, such as solar and wind, is intermittent and unpredictable.

This can be achieved through **Energy Conservation and Efficiency**, which involves improving the energy efficiency of buildings, appliances, and transportation. **Lifestyle Changes**, such as reducing meat consumption and flying, can also reduce emissions.\n\n**Dietary Change**\n\nAgriculture is a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions, and dietary changes can reduce these emissions. This includes reducing meat consumption, which requires more land, water, and energy than plant-based diets. Vegan and vegetarian diets can reduce emissions and improve health.\n\n**Family Size**\n\nFamily size can also affect emissions, as larger families require more resources and energy. Reducing family size can reduce emissions and improve living standards.\n\n**Preserving and Enhancing Carbon Sinks**\n\nCarbon sinks, such as forests, soils, and oceans, absorb CO2 from the atmosphere. Preserving and enhancing these sinks is essential for mitigating climate change. **Forests** are a critical carbon sink, and deforestation accounts for around 15% of global emissions. **Conservation** and **Afforestation and Reforestation** can help preserve and restore forests.\n\n**Soils**\n\nSoils are a significant carbon sink, and soil degradation can release stored carbon into the atmosphere. **Soil Conservation** and **Enhanced Weathering** can help preserve and enhance soil carbon.\n\n**Wetlands**\n\nWetlands are a critical carbon sink, and their conservation is essential for mitigating climate change. Wetlands can store carbon, filter water, and support biodiversity.\n\n**Deep Ocean**\n\nThe deep ocean is a significant carbon sink, and its conservation is essential for mitigating climate change. The deep ocean can store carbon, support biodiversity, and regulate the climate.\n\n**Enhanced Weathering**\n\nEnhanced weathering is a technique that involves accelerating the natural process of weathering rocks to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. This can be achieved through various methods, including using alkaline minerals to neutralize acidity.\n\n**Other Methods to Capture and Store CO2**\n\nOther methods to capture and store CO2 include **Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS)**, which involves capturing CO2 emissions from power plants and storing them underground. **Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS)**, which involves capturing CO2 emissions from bioenergy power plants, is also being developed.\n\n**Mitigation by Sector**\n\nMitigation efforts can be sector-specific, and some sectors are more challenging to mitigate than others. **Buildings**, **Urban Planning**, and **Transport** are critical sectors that require significant mitigation efforts.\n\n**Buildings**\n\nBuildings are a significant source of emissions, and improving building energy efficiency is essential for mitigating climate change. This involves developing energy-efficient building materials, improving building design, and promoting sustainable building practices.\n\n**Urban Planning**\n\nUrban planning is essential for mitigating climate change, as cities are significant sources of emissions. This involves developing sustainable urban planning practices, promoting green infrastructure, and reducing urban sprawl.\n\n**Transport**\n\nTransport is a significant source of emissions, and reducing emissions from transport is essential for mitigating climate change. This involves promoting electric vehicles, improving public transportation, and reducing air travel.\n\n**Shipping**\n\nShipping is a significant source of emissions, and reducing emissions from shipping is essential for mitigating climate change. This involves promoting cleaner fuels, improving ship design, and reducing cargo weights.\n\n**Air Transport**\n\nAir transport is a significant source of emissions, and reducing emissions from air transport is essential for mitigating climate change. This involves promoting electric or hybrid-electric aircraft, improving air traffic management, and reducing passenger demand.\n\n**Agriculture, Forestry and Land Use**\n\nAgriculture, forestry, and land use are significant sources of emissions, and reducing emissions from these sectors is essential for mitigating climate change. This involves promoting sustainable agriculture practices, reforestation, and afforestation.\n\n**Industry**\n\nIndustry is a significant source of emissions, and reducing emissions from industry is essential for mitigating climate change. This involves promoting energy efficiency, reducing waste, and developing cleaner production technologies.\n\n**Co-benefits**\n\nMitigation efforts can also provide co-benefits, such as **Employment and Economic Development**, **Energy Security**, **Health and Well-being**, and **Climate Change Adaptation**.\n\n**Employment and Economic Development**\n\nMitigation efforts can create jobs and stimulate economic development. This involves promoting green industries, improving energy efficiency, and reducing waste.\n\n**Energy Security**\n\nMitigation efforts can improve energy security by reducing dependence on fossil fuels and promoting renewable energy sources.\n\n**Health and Well-being**\n\nMitigation efforts can improve health and well-being by reducing air pollution, promoting clean water, and improving sanitation.\n\n**Climate Change Adaptation**\n\nMitigation efforts can also support climate change adaptation by reducing vulnerability to climate-related disasters and improving resilience.\n\n**Negative Side Effects**\n\nMitigation efforts can also have negative side effects, such as **Displacement of Communities**, **Unintended Consequences**, and **Social Injustice**.\n\n**Costs and Funding**\n\nMitigation efforts require significant funding, and the costs of mitigation can be high. However, the costs of inaction can be even higher, and avoiding the costs of climate change effects can be a cost-effective approach.\n\n**Avoided Costs of Climate Change Effects**\n\nAvoiding the costs of climate change effects can be a cost-effective approach. This involves estimating the costs of climate change effects, such as sea-level rise, more frequent natural disasters, and reduced economic productivity.\n\n**Distributing Emissions Abatement Costs**\n\nDistributing emissions abatement costs can be a challenge, as some groups may bear a disproportionate burden of mitigation costs.

These systems provide a standardized way for climbers to evaluate and communicate the level of challenge posed by a particular climb. While various grading systems have been developed over the years, they all share the goal of helping climbers assess the risks and rewards associated with a particular route.\n\n**History**\n\nThe first climbing grades were developed in the early 20th century, primarily in Europe. The French numerical grade system, introduced in the 1950s, was one of the first standardized grading systems. In the United States, the American YDS (Yosemite Decimal System) grade was developed in the 1950s and 1960s. The UIAA (Union of International Alpine Associations) scale, introduced in the 1970s, aimed to provide a standardized grading system across Europe. Other notable systems, such as the British E-grade and the Font grade, have also been developed over the years.\n\n**Free Climbing**\n\nFree climbing involves ascending a rock face without the aid of equipment, relying solely on strength, technique, and physical endurance. Various grading systems have been developed to quantify the difficulty of free climbing routes.\n\n### French Numerical Grade\n\nThe French numerical grade system, also known as the \"Français\" or \"French\" system, rates climbs from 1 to 9, with additional letters (A, B, C, etc.) used to indicate additional difficulty. The system is as follows:\n\n* 1: Easy climb with minimal danger\n* 2: Moderate climb with some exposure\n* 3: Difficult climb with significant exposure\n* 4: Very difficult climb with extreme exposure\n* 5: Extremely difficult climb with severe exposure\n* 6: Extremely difficult climb with extreme exposure\n* 7: Extremely difficult climb with severe exposure\n* 8: Extremely difficult climb with extreme exposure\n* 9: Extremely difficult climb with severe exposure\n\nEach additional letter (A, B, C, etc.) indicates a further increase in difficulty.\n\n### American YDS Grade\n\nThe American YDS grade system rates climbs from Class 1 (easy) to Class 5 (extremely difficult). The system is as follows:\n\n* Class 1: Easy climb with minimal danger\n* Class 2: Moderate climb with some exposure\n* Class 3: Difficult climb with significant exposure\n* Class 4: Very difficult climb with extreme exposure\n* Class 5: Extremely difficult climb with severe exposure\n\nEach additional number (5.0, 5.1, 5.2, etc.) indicates a further increase in difficulty.\n\n### UIAA Scale\n\nThe UIAA scale rates climbs from I (easy) to VIII (extremely difficult). The system is as follows:\n\n* I: Easy climb with minimal danger\n* II: Moderate climb with some exposure\n* III: Difficult climb with significant exposure\n* IV: Very difficult climb with extreme exposure\n* V: Extremely difficult climb with severe exposure\n* VI: Extremely difficult climb with extreme exposure\n* VII: Extremely difficult climb with severe exposure\n* VIII: Extremely difficult climb with extreme exposure\n\n### British E-grade\n\nThe British E-grade system rates climbs from E1 (easy) to E9 (extremely difficult). The system is as follows:\n\n* E1: Easy climb with minimal danger\n* E2: Moderate climb with some exposure\n* E3: Difficult climb with significant exposure\n* E4: Very difficult climb with extreme exposure\n* E5: Extremely difficult climb with severe exposure\n* E6: Extremely difficult climb with extreme exposure\n* E7: Extremely difficult climb with severe exposure\n* E8: Extremely difficult climb with extreme exposure\n* E9: Extremely difficult climb with severe exposure\n\n### Other Notable Systems\n\nOther notable grading systems include the Font grade, the V-grade, and the Japanese \"F\" grade.\n\n**Bouldering**\n\nBouldering involves ascending short, low-level rock formations without the aid of equipment, relying solely on strength, technique, and physical endurance. Various grading systems have been developed to quantify the difficulty of bouldering problems.\n\n### Comparison with Free Climbing\n\nBouldering and free climbing share many similarities, but bouldering typically involves shorter, more intense ascents.\n\n### Font Grade\n\nThe Font grade system rates bouldering problems from Font 1 (easy) to Font 9 (extremely difficult). The system is as follows:\n\n* Font 1: Easy problem with minimal danger\n* Font 2: Moderate problem with some exposure\n* Font 3: Difficult problem with significant exposure\n* Font 4: Very difficult problem with extreme exposure\n* Font 5: Extremely difficult problem with severe exposure\n* Font 6: Extremely difficult problem with extreme exposure\n* Font 7: Extremely difficult problem with severe exposure\n* Font 8: Extremely difficult problem with extreme exposure\n* Font 9: Extremely difficult problem with severe exposure\n\n### V-grade\n\nThe V-grade system rates bouldering problems from V0 (easy) to V16 (extremely difficult). The system is as follows:\n\n* V0: Easy problem with minimal danger\n* V1: Moderate problem with some exposure\n* V2: Difficult problem with significant exposure\n* V3: Very difficult problem with extreme exposure\n* V4: Extremely difficult problem with severe exposure\n* V5: Extremely difficult problem with extreme exposure\n* V6: Extremely difficult problem with severe exposure\n* V7: Extremely difficult problem with extreme exposure\n* V8: Extremely difficult problem with severe exposure\n* V9: Extremely difficult problem with extreme exposure\n* V10: Extremely difficult problem with severe exposure\n* V11: Extremely difficult problem with extreme exposure\n* V12: Extremely difficult problem with severe exposure\n* V13: Extremely difficult problem with extreme exposure\n* V14: Extremely difficult problem with severe exposure\n* V15: Extremely difficult problem with extreme exposure\n* V16: Extremely difficult problem with severe exposure\n\n### Other Notable Systems\n\nOther notable grading systems include the Japanese \"F\" grade, the Russian \"Russian\" grade, and the Alaskan \"Alaskan\" grade.\n\n**Aid Climbing**\n\nAid climbing involves ascending a rock face using equipment such as ladders, ropes, and anchors. Various grading systems have been developed to quantify the difficulty of aid climbing routes.\n\n### Instability of Aid Grades\n\nAid grades can be unreliable due to the variable nature of aid techniques and equipment.\n\n### Original A-grade\n\nThe original A-grade system rates aid climbing routes from A0 (easy) to A5 (extremely difficult).

His early life is not well-documented, but it is known that he was the son of a family of modest means. Little is known about his family background, but it is clear that he was educated from a young age and had a strong interest in natural history.\n\n**Education**\n\nKrefft's education began in his hometown, where he likely attended a local grammar school. He later moved to Berlin, where he studied natural history at the University of Berlin. During his time in Berlin, Krefft became familiar with the work of prominent natural historians, including Alexander von Humboldt and Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius.\n\n**Marriage**\n\nIn 1862, Krefft married a woman named Louisa, who was of English descent. The couple had two children together, but little is known about their family life.\n\n**German Heritage**\n\nKrefft's German heritage had a significant impact on his intellectual and professional development. He was heavily influenced by the German tradition of natural history, which emphasized the importance of observation, experimentation, and classification. This emphasis on empirical research and rigorous observation would shape Krefft's approach to natural history and inform his work as a curator and administrator.\n\n**Natural History**\n\nKrefft's interest in natural history was evident from an early age. He began collecting specimens and studying the natural world in his teenage years. During his time in Berlin, he became familiar with the work of prominent natural historians, including Alexander von Humboldt and Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius. This exposure had a profound impact on Krefft's intellectual development and shaped his approach to natural history.\n\n**Darwinian Doctrine and the Consequent Darwinian Controversy**\n\nThe publication of Charles Darwin's \"On the Origin of Species\" in 1859 had a significant impact on the scientific community. Krefft was among those who were influenced by Darwin's ideas, which challenged traditional notions of species and the natural world. However, not everyone was convinced by Darwin's theories, and a controversy erupted over the validity of his ideas.\n\n**Evolution**\n\nKrefft was a strong supporter of Darwin's theory of evolution. He believed that the natural world was shaped by a process of gradual change over time, and that species evolved through the process of natural selection. This idea was central to Krefft's understanding of natural history and informed his work as a curator and administrator.\n\n**Natural Selection**\n\nKrefft believed that natural selection was the key mechanism driving the evolution of species. He saw natural selection as a process of \"survival of the fittest,\" where species adapted to their environment through the struggle for existence. This idea was central to Krefft's understanding of natural history and informed his work as a curator and administrator.\n\n**Ellegård's Five Positions Held by Scientists in the Darwinian Controversy**\n\nIn 1932, the Swedish scientist Alvar Ellegård proposed a typology of five positions held by scientists in the Darwinian controversy. These positions were:\n\n1. The \"anti-Darwinians,\" who rejected Darwin's theories outright.\n2. The \"Darwinians,\" who accepted Darwin's theories without reservation.\n3. The \"adaptationists,\" who accepted Darwin's theories but rejected his explanation for the mechanism of evolution.\n4. The \"transformists,\" who accepted Darwin's theories but rejected his idea of gradualism.\n5. The \"revisionists,\" who accepted Darwin's theories but sought to revise and refine them.\n\nKrefft's position on the Darwinian controversy was that of a Darwinian, who accepted Darwin's theories without reservation.\n\n**Artist**\n\nIn addition to his work as a natural historian, Krefft was also a skilled artist. He was known for his detailed drawings of plants and animals, which were highly regarded by his peers. Krefft's artistic skills were likely honed during his time in Berlin, where he studied under the tutelage of prominent artists.\n\n**Victoria (1852 – 1858)**\n\nIn 1852, the British Royal Society of Victoria was established in Melbourne, Australia. The society's first president was Charles La Trobe, who was a strong supporter of Krefft's work. During his time in Melbourne, Krefft was involved in several expeditions to the surrounding countryside, where he collected specimens and made detailed observations of the natural world.\n\n**Melbourne**\n\nKrefft's time in Melbourne was marked by several significant events. In 1853, he was appointed as the curator of the Melbourne Museum, where he worked under the tutelage of Professor Frederick McCoy. During his time at the museum, Krefft was responsible for the collection and cataloging of specimens, as well as the development of the museum's collections.\n\n**Blandowski, the Museum of Natural History, and Professor McCoy**\n\nKrefft's work at the Melbourne Museum was influenced by the museum's founder, Count Paul Strzelecki, and its curator, Professor Frederick McCoy. The museum was a hub of scientific activity in Melbourne, and Krefft was heavily involved in the development of its collections. He worked closely with other scientists, including the Polish naturalist Count Paul Strzelecki, who was a prominent figure in the early days of the museum.\n\n**Germany**\n\nIn 1858, Krefft returned to Germany, where he worked as a curator at the Dresden Zoological Garden. During his time in Dresden, Krefft was involved in several expeditions to the surrounding countryside, where he collected specimens and made detailed observations of the natural world.\n\n**Natural Historian, Museum Curator, and Administrator**\n\nKrefft's work as a natural historian, museum curator, and administrator was marked by several significant events. In 1862, he was appointed as the curator of the British Museum's Department of Zoology, where he worked under the tutelage of Professor Richard Owen. During his time at the museum, Krefft was responsible for the collection and cataloging of specimens, as well as the development of the museum's collections.\n\n**Darwinism**\n\nKrefft was a strong supporter of Darwin's theory of evolution. He believed that the natural world was shaped by a process of gradual change over time, and that species evolved through the process of natural selection. This idea was central to Krefft's understanding of natural history and informed his work as a curator and administrator.\n\n**The New Museum Idea**\n\nIn the late 1860s, Krefft became involved in the development of a new museum idea, which emphasized the importance of public museums and the role of the state in supporting scientific research. This idea was central to Krefft's understanding of the role of museums in society and informed his work as a curator and administrator.\n\n**Cabinets of Curiosities**\n\nKrefft's work as a natural historian and curator was influenced by the tradition of cabinets of curiosities, which emphasized the importance of collecting and displaying specimens. During his time at the British Museum, Krefft was responsible for the development of the museum's collections, which included a large number of specimens collected by Sir Joseph Banks.\n\n**Public Museums**\n\nKrefft believed that public museums played a crucial role in promoting scientific research and education. He saw museums as institutions that could bring the natural world to the public, and that could educate people about the importance of science and natural history.\n\n**The \"New Museum\"**\n\nKrefft's vision for the \"new museum\" emphasized the importance of public engagement and education. He believed that museums should be accessible to the public, and that they should provide a platform for scientists to share their knowledge and ideas. This vision was central to Krefft's understanding of the role of museums in society and informed his work as a curator and administrator.\n\n**Krefft's Curatorial Rationale**\n\nKrefft's approach to curating was influenced by his understanding of the importance of public engagement and education. He believed that museums should be places where people could learn about science and natural history, and that they should provide a platform for scientists to share their knowledge and ideas.\n\n**Lack of Funding**\n\nKrefft's work as a curator and administrator was often hampered by a lack of funding. He relied on grants and donations to support his work, and he often had to struggle to secure the resources he needed to develop the museum's collections.\n\n**Photography**\n\nIn the late 1860s, Krefft became interested in photography, which was a new technology at the time. He saw photography as a way to document the natural world and to provide a visual record of the museum's collections. During his time at the British Museum, Krefft was responsible for the development of the museum's photographic collections.\n\n**Queensland Lungfish (Neoceratodus forsteri)**\n\nKrefft's work as a natural historian and curator was influenced by his interest in the Queensland lungfish, which was a species that he studied extensively. During his time at the British Museum, Krefft was responsible for the development of the museum's collections of fish, which included a large number of specimens of the Queensland lungfish.\n\n**Louis Agassiz and the Chimaera**\n\nKrefft's work as a natural historian and curator was influenced by his knowledge of the work of Louis Agassiz, who was a prominent zoologist. During his time at the British Museum, Krefft was responsible for the development of the museum's collections of fish, which included a large number of specimens of the chimaera, a species that Agassiz had studied extensively.\n\n**Gerard Krefft, William Forster, and the Cartilaginous Burnett Salmon or Barramunda**\n\nKrefft's work as a natural historian and curator was influenced by his interest in the cartilaginous Burnett salmon or barramunda, which was a species that he studied extensively. During his time at the British Museum, Krefft was responsible for the development of the museum's collections of fish, which included a large number of specimens of this species.\n\n**January 1870**\n\nIn January 1870, Krefft was appointed as the curator of the National Museum of Victoria, where he worked under the tutelage of Professor Frederick McCoy. During his time at the museum, Krefft was responsible for the collection and cataloging of specimens, as well as the development of the museum's collections.\n\n**Krefft's \"Natural History\" Articles in The Sydney Mail**\n\nIn the late 1860s and early 1870s, Krefft wrote a series of articles on natural history for The Sydney Mail, a newspaper that was published in Sydney, Australia. These articles were highly regarded by his peers and provided a platform for Krefft to share his knowledge and ideas with a wider audience.\n\n**George B.

The flight took place on April 20, 2023, at the SpaceX facility in Boca Chica, Texas, and marked a significant milestone in the development of the Starship program.\n\n**Background**\n\n**Starship**\n\nThe Starship is a reusable spacecraft designed to carry both crew and cargo to the Moon, Mars, and other destinations in the solar system. The spacecraft is powered by a Raptor engine, which is a full-flow staged combustion cycle engine capable of producing 200 metric tons of thrust. The Starship is designed to be fully reusable, with the ability to launch, return, and refuel multiple times.\n\n**Development**\n\nThe development of the Starship began in 2012, with the formation of SpaceX's Starship project. The project was led by Elon Musk, the CEO of SpaceX, who has stated that the goal of the program is to establish a permanent, self-sustaining human presence on Mars. The development of the Starship has been a complex and challenging process, involving the design and testing of multiple prototypes and components.\n\n**Opinions before launch**\n\nIn the months leading up to the first flight test, there was significant interest and speculation in the space community about the prospects of the Starship program. Some experts expressed concerns about the technical challenges and risks associated with the program, while others were more optimistic about the potential for the Starship to revolutionize space travel. The media also played a significant role in generating interest in the program, with many outlets publishing articles and reports about the Starship and its development.\n\n**Test objectives**\n\nThe primary objective of the first flight test was to demonstrate the ability of the Starship to launch, fly, and return safely. The test also aimed to evaluate the performance of the Raptor engine and the spacecraft's avionics and communication systems. Additionally, the test was intended to gather data on the spacecraft's aerodynamic characteristics and its ability to navigate and control during flight.\n\n**Launch**\n\n**Flight profile**\n\nThe Starship was launched from the SpaceX facility in Boca Chica, Texas, at 9:30 AM CDT on April 20, 2023. The spacecraft reached a maximum altitude of approximately 12 kilometers (39,000 feet) and remained in flight for approximately 10 minutes. The spacecraft then descended and landed safely back on the launchpad.\n\n**Flight timeline**\n\nThe flight timeline of the Starship was as follows:\n\n* 9:30 AM CDT: Launch\n* 9:40 AM CDT: Maximum altitude reached (12 km/39,000 ft)\n* 9:50 AM CDT: Descent phase began\n* 9:55 AM CDT: Landed safely back on the launchpad\n\n**April 17, 2023 attempt**\n\nPrior to the successful flight test on April 20, 2023, SpaceX had attempted to launch the Starship on April 17, 2023. However, the launch was scrubbed due to a technical issue with the Raptor engine. The issue was reportedly related to a faulty valve, which prevented the engine from igniting properly.\n\n**April 20, 2023, 2nd attempt**\n\nAfter the technical issue was resolved, SpaceX attempted to launch the Starship again on April 20, 2023. This time, the launch was successful, and the spacecraft reached a maximum altitude of 12 kilometers (39,000 feet) before returning safely to the launchpad.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\n**Technical assessments**\n\nFollowing the successful flight test, SpaceX conducted a thorough technical assessment of the Starship and its systems. The assessment revealed that the spacecraft performed well during the flight, with all systems functioning as expected. However, the assessment also identified some areas for improvement, including the need for further refinement of the Raptor engine and the spacecraft's avionics and communication systems.\n\n**Launch site**\n\nThe Starship was launched from the SpaceX facility in Boca Chica, Texas, which has been developed specifically for the Starship program. The facility features a launchpad, a landing pad, and a manufacturing and assembly area for the spacecraft. The facility is located on a 2,000-acre site near the Gulf of Mexico, which provides access to the ocean and a stable and secure environment for the launch and testing of the Starship.\n\n**Effects on environment**\n\nThe launch and flight of the Starship had some environmental effects, including the emission of noise and vibrations during launch and the release of some gases during the flight. However, these effects were relatively minor and were not considered to be significant. SpaceX has implemented measures to minimize the environmental impact of the Starship program, including the use of noise-reducing technologies and the implementation of recycling and waste management programs.\n\n**FAA investigation**\n\nFollowing the successful flight test, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) conducted an investigation to ensure that the Starship had been launched and operated safely and in compliance with all relevant regulations. The investigation found that the Starship had been launched and operated safely and that all relevant regulations had been complied with. The FAA also praised SpaceX for its commitment to safety and its ongoing efforts to develop and test the Starship.\n\n**See also**\n\n* SpaceX Starship\n* Raptor engine\n* Boca Chica, Texas\n* Federal Aviation Administration\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is based on publicly available information and has not been reviewed or verified by any official sources.\n* The article is intended to provide a general overview of the Starship Flight Test 1 and its significance in the development of the Starship program.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The dynasty's power and influence peaked during the 13th century, with the Aberffraw princes claiming the title of Prince of Wales and playing a significant role in the country's politics.\n\n**Aberffraw hundred (cantref)**\n\nThe Aberffraw hundred, also known as the cantref of Aberffraw, was a territorial division in northwest Wales that served as the power base of the House of Aberffraw. The hundred was situated on the island of Anglesey, off the north coast of Wales, and consisted of fertile land, forests, and coastal areas. The cantref was an important agricultural and commercial center, with the Aberffraw princes controlling the trade and commerce of the region.\n\n**Welsh dynasties**\n\nThe Aberffraw dynasty was one of the several powerful Welsh dynasties that emerged during the 10th century. The dynasty was founded by Rhodri the Great, who united various Welsh kingdoms and established the Kingdom of Gwynedd. The Aberffraw princes were descended from Rhodri's son, Idwal ap Rhodri, who ruled over the cantref of Aberffraw.\n\n**Succession**\n\nThe succession of the Aberffraw princes was typically through the male line, with the eldest son inheriting the throne. However, the dynasty was not immune to conflicts over succession, particularly during the 13th and 14th centuries. The Aberffraw princes often engaged in struggles for power, which sometimes led to the involvement of external forces, including the English crown.\n\n**Cambro-Norse era**\n\nDuring the 9th and 10th centuries, Wales was influenced by the Viking invasions, which led to the emergence of a distinct cultural and linguistic identity known as the Cambro-Norse. The Aberffraw dynasty was affected by these invasions, with the princes often forming alliances with the Vikings to counterbalance the power of their Welsh rivals. However, the Aberffraw princes also maintained their independence and resisted the Viking attempts to conquer their territories.\n\n**Power base (Norman invasion)**\n\nThe Norman invasion of Wales in the 11th century marked the beginning of a new era for the Aberffraw dynasty. The Aberffraw princes were forced to adapt to the new reality of Norman rule, with the English crown exerting significant influence over Welsh politics. The Aberffraw dynasty responded by forming alliances with the Normans and adopting their military tactics and administrative practices.\n\n**Aberffraw senior line**\n\nThe Aberffraw senior line was a direct descendant of Rhodri the Great and was the most prominent line within the Aberffraw dynasty. The senior line produced several notable Aberffraw princes, including Gruffydd ap Cynan, who united the Welsh kingdoms and established the Kingdom of Gwynedd. The senior line also produced Llywelyn the Great, who played a significant role in Welsh politics during the 13th century.\n\n**Llys**\n\nThe llys was the administrative and judicial center of the Aberffraw cantref, serving as the seat of the Aberffraw prince. The llys was typically located in a strategic location, such as a hilltop or a fortified town. The Aberffraw prince would often hold court at the llys, dispensing justice and making important decisions for the cantref.\n\n**Rhosyr**\n\nRhosyr was a town located on the island of Anglesey, off the north coast of Wales. The town served as the capital of the Aberffraw cantref and was an important commercial and cultural center. Rhosyr was known for its beautiful church, which was dedicated to St. Seiriol and served as a major pilgrimage site.\n\n**Aberffraw**\n\nAberffraw was a town located on the island of Anglesey, off the north coast of Wales. The town served as the power base of the Aberffraw dynasty and was an important administrative and judicial center. Aberffraw was known for its strategic location, which allowed the Aberffraw princes to control the trade and commerce of the region.\n\n**Princes of Wales (de facto)**\n\nThe Aberffraw princes claimed the title of Prince of Wales, which was a symbolic title that represented their authority over the Welsh people. The Aberffraw princes were considered the de facto rulers of Wales, with the English crown acknowledging their power and influence.\n\n**Llywelyn the Great**\n\nLlywelyn the Great was a notable Aberffraw prince who played a significant role in Welsh politics during the 13th century. Llywelyn was the grandson of Gruffydd ap Cynan and was known for his military prowess and strategic thinking. Llywelyn united the Welsh kingdoms and established the Kingdom of Gwynedd, which became a major power in Wales.\n\n**1200s- 1400s**\n\nDuring the 13th and 14th centuries, the Aberffraw dynasty continued to play a significant role in Welsh politics. The Aberffraw princes often engaged in struggles for power, which sometimes led to the involvement of external forces, including the English crown. However, the Aberffraw princes maintained their independence and resisted the English attempts to conquer their territories.\n\n**Succession after the dynasty**\n\nThe Aberffraw dynasty eventually declined in power and influence, with the last notable Aberffraw prince being Owain Glyn Dŵr, who led a rebellion against the English crown in the 15th century. The Aberffraw dynasty was eventually replaced by the Tudor dynasty, which ruled over Wales and England for several centuries.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Aberffraw\n* Anglesey\n* Gwynedd\n* Kingdom of Wales\n* Llywelyn the Great\n* Princes of Wales\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n* \n* \n* \n\n**References**\n\n* \n* \n* \n\n**Sources**\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n*", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The scandal has sparked widespread public outrage, introspection, and calls for accountability.\n\n**Background**\n\n### COVID-19 Lockdowns in the United Kingdom\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic led the UK government to implement a series of lockdowns to slow the spread of the virus. The first national lockdown was imposed on 23 March 2020, followed by local lockdowns in different regions. The government enforced strict rules, including the closure of non-essential businesses, restrictions on gatherings, and requirements for people to stay at home.\n\n### Westminster\n\nDowning Street, the official residence of the British Prime Minister, is located within the Westminster district of London. As the center of government, it is subject to strict rules and regulations, including those related to COVID-19 lockdowns.\n\n**Timeline of Reporting and Reaction**\n\n### 2021\n\n#### Up to 6 December\n\nThe first reports of potential lockdown breaches in Downing Street emerged in November 2021, but they were largely dismissed as \"rumors\" by government officials.\n\n#### Stratton video (7–8 December)\n\nOn 7 December 2021, a video surfaced of Allegra Stratton, the then-Press Secretary, joking about a party in Downing Street on 20 December 2020, during a mock press conference. The video sparked widespread outrage, and Johnson apologized for the \"anger and frustration\" caused.\n\n#### 9 December onwards\n\nThe scandal gained momentum, with media outlets publishing articles and interviews suggesting that multiple parties were held in Downing Street during the lockdown. The Prime Minister and his staff faced intense scrutiny, with calls for resignations and investigations.\n\n### 2022\n\n#### Up to 19 January\n\nThe government faced increasing pressure to provide answers about the parties. Johnson initially denied any wrongdoing, but eventually admitted to attending a \"bring your own booze\" party in the garden of 10 Downing Street.\n\n#### From 24 January\n\nThe UK's Sue Gray, a senior civil servant, was tasked with investigating the allegations. She published a preliminary report on 25 January, which found \"failures of leadership and judgment\" in the government's handling of the lockdown.\n\n#### After the conclusion of the police investigation\n\nThe Metropolitan Police Service concluded its investigation in February 2023, issuing fines to several staff members, including Johnson himself. The Prime Minister became the first British PM to be fined for breaking the law.\n\n#### After the publication of Gray's report\n\nSue Gray published her full report on 25 January 2023, which was heavily critical of the government's handling of the lockdown. The report found that the Prime Minister's staff had \"acted recklessly\" and that there were \"systemic failures\" in the government's culture.\n\n### 2023\n\n#### COVID-19 Inquiry evidence\n\nAs part of the COVID-19 Inquiry, evidence was presented on the government's handling of the pandemic, including the lockdowns and the Partygate scandal.\n\n#### June–October 2023\n\nThe scandal continued to dominate the headlines, with Johnson's leadership facing intense scrutiny. The Prime Minister eventually announced his resignation on 24 October 2022.\n\n**Events**\n\n### During first national lockdown\n\nThe first national lockdown was imposed on 23 March 2020, with the government urging people to stay at home and avoid non-essential travel. However, it emerged that multiple parties were held in Downing Street during this period, including a \"BYOB\" party on 20 March 2020.\n\n### Mid-2020\n\nAs the lockdown continued, the government faced increasing pressure to provide answers about the parties. Johnson initially denied any wrongdoing, but eventually admitted to attending a \"bring your own booze\" party in the garden of 10 Downing Street.\n\n### During second lockdown in England\n\nThe second national lockdown was imposed on 5 November 2020, with the government restricting gatherings and enforcing strict rules. However, it emerged that multiple parties were held in Downing Street during this period, including a party on 13 November 2020.\n\n### With London in Tier 2\n\nAs London entered Tier 2 restrictions, the government faced increasing pressure to provide answers about the parties. Johnson eventually admitted to attending a party in the garden of 10 Downing Street on 18 December 2020.\n\n### With London in Tier 3\n\nAs London entered Tier 3 restrictions, the government faced intense scrutiny over the parties. Johnson eventually apologized for attending a party in the garden of 10 Downing Street on 20 December 2020.\n\n### During third lockdown in England\n\nThe third national lockdown was imposed on 4 January 2021, with the government restricting gatherings and enforcing strict rules. However, it emerged that multiple parties were held in Downing Street during this period, including a party on 27 December 2020.\n\n**Investigations**\n\n### Cabinet Office inquiry\n\nThe Cabinet Office launched an investigation into the allegations, led by Simon Case, the then-Permanent Secretary. However, Case was later involved in the scandal himself, and the investigation was taken over by Sue Gray.\n\n#### Sue Gray\n\nSue Gray, a senior civil servant, was tasked with investigating the allegations. She published a preliminary report on 25 January, which found \"failures of leadership and judgment\" in the government's handling of the lockdown.\n\n#### Investigation update\n\nThe investigation continued, with Gray's report providing a damning critique of the government's handling of the lockdown.\n\n#### Alleged lobbying before the final report was published\n\nThere were allegations that government officials were lobbying to influence the final report. An investigation was launched, but no evidence was found to support the claims.\n\n#### Final report\n\nSue Gray published her full report on 25 January 2023, which was heavily critical of the government's handling of the lockdown. The report found that the Prime Minister's staff had \"acted recklessly\" and that there were \"systemic failures\" in the government's culture.\n\n### Police investigation\n\nThe Metropolitan Police Service launched an investigation into the allegations, which led to fines being issued to several staff members, including Johnson himself.\n\n#### Fixed penalty notices\n\nThe police issued fixed penalty notices to several staff members, including Johnson, for breaching COVID-19 lockdown rules.\n\n#### Scrutiny of the investigation\n\nThe police investigation was subject to intense scrutiny, with some questioning the handling of the case and the decision to issue fines to the Prime Minister.\n\n## Privileges Committee investigation\n\nThe House of Commons Privileges Committee launched an investigation into the allegations, led by Harriet Harman. The committee's report was critical of the Prime Minister's handling of the scandal.\n\n**Reactions**\n\n### Within the Conservative Party\n\n#### Initial responses\n\nThe Conservative Party faced intense pressure to respond to the allegations. Johnson initially denied any wrongdoing, but eventually apologized for attending a party in the garden of 10 Downing Street.\n\n#### Alleged intimidation of MPs opposed to Johnson\n\nThere were allegations that Conservative Party officials were intimidating MPs who opposed Johnson's leadership.

The film stars Daniel Kaluuya, Keke Palmer, Brandon Perea, Steven Yeun, and Wrenn Schmidt. The film is Peele's third feature film, following Get Out (2017) and Us (2019).\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film takes place in 1990s California and follows the story of a horse ranch, Haywood, located near a mysterious UFO sighting. The ranch is owned by Otis Haywood Jr. (Keith David) and his wife Emerald (Ruth Negga). The story centers around OJ (Daniel Kaluuya), a former Marine who returns to the ranch after a traumatic event and is tasked with investigating strange occurrences on the property.\n\nOJ is joined by Emerald's nephew, Angel (Brandon Perea), who is an amateur drone enthusiast, and Antlers Holst (Michael Wincott), a scientist who has been studying the UFO. As they delve deeper into the mystery, they discover that the UFO is not just a random event but is actually a harbinger of a much larger and more sinister force.\n\nAs the story unfolds, OJ and his companions realize that the UFO is a gateway to a parallel universe, and that the creatures from that universe are attempting to invade our world. The creatures, known as \"the entities,\" are massive, tentacled beings that seem to be made of some sort of dark energy.\n\nThroughout the film, Peele explores themes of grief, trauma, and the search for meaning in a seemingly meaningless world. The film's title, \"Nope,\" refers to the idea that we often try to dismiss or deny the reality of traumatic events, but that ultimately, we cannot escape the consequences of our experiences.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Daniel Kaluuya as OJ\n* Keke Palmer as Emerald\n* Brandon Perea as Angel\n* Steven Yeun as Ricky \"Jupe\" Park\n* Wrenn Schmidt as Amber\n* Keith David as Otis Haywood Jr.\n* Michael Wincott as Antlers Holst\n* Barbie Ferreira as Indira\n* Dolly de Leon as Mary\n\n**Themes and interpretations**\n\nNope is a thought-provoking film that explores a range of themes, including grief, trauma, and the search for meaning in a seemingly meaningless world. The film's title, \"Nope,\" refers to the idea that we often try to dismiss or deny the reality of traumatic events, but that ultimately, we cannot escape the consequences of our experiences.\n\nThe film's use of the UFO and the entities serves as a metaphor for the unknown and the unknowable, and the ways in which we try to make sense of the world around us. The film also explores the idea of the \"other,\" and the ways in which we try to define and categorize those things that are different from us.\n\nOne of the most striking aspects of the film is its use of color and imagery. The film's palette is dominated by a range of muted, earthy tones, which serves to emphasize the sense of desolation and isolation that pervades the story. The use of long, sweeping shots and close-ups adds to the sense of tension and foreboding, and helps to create a sense of unease in the viewer.\n\n**Production**\n\n#### Development\n\nNope was first announced in 2019, with Jordan Peele set to write and direct the film. Peele had been working on the script for several years, and had originally planned to make the film a science fiction horror comedy. However, as he delved deeper into the project, he began to see it as a more serious and somber film, and the tone shifted accordingly.\n\n#### Filming\n\nFilming for Nope took place over the course of several months in 2021, with a cast and crew of around 200 people. The film was shot on location in California, with a range of different locations used to create the film's unique and otherworldly atmosphere.\n\n#### Creature design\n\nThe creatures in Nope were designed by a team of special effects experts, who used a combination of practical and CGI effects to bring the entities to life. The creatures were designed to be massive and imposing, with long, tentacled bodies and glowing red eyes.\n\n#### Costumes\n\nThe costumes in Nope were designed by a team of costume designers, who worked closely with the cast to create a range of unique and practical costumes. The costumes were designed to be functional and comfortable, while also adding to the overall aesthetic of the film.\n\n#### Sound design\n\nThe sound design for Nope was created by a team of sound designers, who worked closely with the film's composer to create a range of unique and unsettling sound effects. The sound effects were designed to be immersive and engaging, and to add to the overall sense of tension and foreboding in the film.\n\n#### Music\n\nThe music for Nope was composed by Michael Abels, who worked closely with Jordan Peele to create a range of unique and unsettling musical themes. The music was designed to be haunting and atmospheric, and to add to the overall sense of unease and tension in the film.\n\n**Marketing**\n\nThe marketing campaign for Nope was extensive and far-reaching, with a range of different trailers and promotional materials released over the course of several months. The film's first trailer was released in June 2022, and was accompanied by a range of social media promotions and online advertising.\n\n**Release**\n\nNope was released in theaters on July 22, 2022, and was a critical and commercial success. The film grossed over $130 million worldwide, and received widespread critical acclaim, with many praising its unique and unsettling atmosphere, as well as its thought-provoking themes and social commentary.\n\n**Reception**\n\nNope received widespread critical acclaim, with many praising its unique and unsettling atmosphere, as well as its thought-provoking themes and social commentary. The film holds a 93% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with many critics praising its use of color and imagery, as well as its performances.\n\n**Box office**\n\nNope grossed over $130 million worldwide, making it one of the highest-grossing films of 2022. The film's success at the box office was a major surprise, given its modest budget and the fact that it was released during a crowded summer season.\n\n**Possible sequels**\n\nThere has been no official word on a sequel to Nope, but Jordan Peele has expressed interest in continuing to explore the world and characters of the film. Peele has stated that he would like to make a sequel that delves deeper into the mythology and world-building of the film, and that explores the consequences of the events of the first film.\n\n**Notes**\n\nNope is a thought-provoking and unsettling film that explores a range of themes and ideas.

Born on March 20, 1892, in San Antonio, Texas, Malone spent his early life in the American South and developed a deep appreciation for American history. He went on to become one of the most prominent historians of his generation, leaving a lasting impact on the field of American studies.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\n### Upbringing\n\nMalone was born to a family of modest means in San Antonio, Texas. His father, a skilled carpenter, instilled in him a love for history and a strong work ethic. Malone's early education took place in the public schools of San Antonio, where he demonstrated a keen interest in the subjects of history and literature.\n\n### Ministry and Yale\n\nIn his late teens, Malone converted to Episcopalianism and began to prepare for a career in the ministry. He attended the University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1913. Malone then went on to study divinity at the Episcopal Divinity School in Cambridge, Massachusetts. However, he soon abandoned his plans for the ministry and instead enrolled in Yale University, where he earned his Master's degree in 1915.\n\nMalone's time at Yale had a profound impact on his academic and professional development. He was exposed to some of the leading historians of his generation, including the renowned Yale historian, George Lincoln Burr. Burr's emphasis on the importance of original research and the need for historians to engage with the broader cultural and intellectual currents of their time had a lasting influence on Malone's approach to historical scholarship.\n\n**Career**\n\n### Virginia and the DAB\n\nIn 1916, Malone joined the faculty at the University of Virginia, where he spent the next several years teaching history and developing his research skills. During this period, he also served as the secretary of the Virginia Historical Society and began work on his first major publication, the Dictionary of American Biography (DAB). The DAB, which was published in 1928, was a comprehensive biographical dictionary of notable Americans, and it established Malone as a leading authority on American biography.\n\n### Harvard University Press\n\nIn 1928, Malone left Virginia to join the faculty at Harvard University, where he spent the next several decades teaching history and continuing his research. He was appointed as the first editor of the Pulitzer Prize-winning biography series, which was published by Harvard University Press. Malone's work on the series, which included his own Pulitzer Prize-winning biography of Thomas Jefferson, established him as one of the leading historians of his generation.\n\n### Return to Virginia\n\nIn 1962, Malone returned to Virginia, where he was appointed as the Charles Sydnor Professor of History at the University of Virginia. He spent the next several years teaching history and continuing his research, and he remained at Virginia until his retirement in 1969.\n\n**Legacy and Honors**\n\nMalone's legacy as a historian and academic is profound. He is remembered for his groundbreaking work on American biography, his Pulitzer Prize-winning biography of Thomas Jefferson, and his commitment to the importance of original research and engagement with the broader cultural and intellectual currents of his time. Malone was also a dedicated teacher and mentor, and he was awarded numerous honors and awards for his contributions to the field of history.\n\n**Personal Life and Death**\n\nMalone was married to his wife, Mary, for over 50 years, and they had two children together. He was a devoted husband, father, and grandfather, and he is remembered for his warmth, wit, and generosity. Malone passed away on January 27, 1986, at the age of 93, leaving behind a lasting legacy as one of the most prominent historians of his generation.\n\n**Selected Publications**\n\n### Jefferson and His Time\n\nMalone's most famous work is his Pulitzer Prize-winning biography of Thomas Jefferson, which was published in six volumes between 1948 and 1981. The biography, which is considered a classic of American historical scholarship, explores Jefferson's life and legacy in depth, and it provides a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of one of America's most important founding figures.\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n* Malone's work on the Dictionary of American Biography established him as a leading authority on American biography.\n* His Pulitzer Prize-winning biography of Thomas Jefferson is considered a classic of American historical scholarship.\n* Malone was a dedicated teacher and mentor, and he was awarded numerous honors and awards for his contributions to the field of history.\n\n**References**\n\n* Scholarly sources\n\t+ Books\n\t\t- Malone, Dumas.

Born Anna Mae Bullock on November 26, 1939, in Nutbush, Tennessee, she rose to international fame as the lead singer of the Ike & Tina Turner Revue, and later achieved immense success as a solo artist. Known for her powerful vocals, energetic stage presence, and iconic style, Turner is one of the most influential and beloved musicians of all time.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nTurner was born to poor working-class parents, Floyd and Zelma Bullock. Her early life was marked by hardship and violence, with her mother often chased by Floyd's abusive behavior. At the age of 11, Turner moved to Knoxville, Tennessee, to live with her grandparents. She attended high school in Finley, Tennessee, where she developed a passion for music, singing in the church choir and performing in local talent shows.\n\n**Ike and Tina Turner**\n\n#### Origins: 1956–1960\n\nIn 1956, Turner met Ike Turner, a talented musician and band leader, in St. Louis, Missouri. Ike was impressed by Turner's voice and invited her to join his band as a backing vocalist. The two began a romantic relationship, and Ike soon made Turner the lead singer of his band, renaming her \"Little Ann\" or simply \"Tina.\"\n\n#### Early Success: 1960–1965\n\nThe Ike & Tina Turner Revue began performing regularly in the Midwest, eventually gaining national attention with their energetic live performances and unique blend of rock, R&B, and soul music. In 1960, the group signed with Sue Records, releasing their first single, \"A Fool in Love,\" which became a moderate success. Over the next few years, the duo built a loyal fan base, touring extensively and releasing several successful singles, including \"It's Gonna Work Out Fine\" and \"Poor Fool.\"\n\n#### Mainstream Success: 1966–1975\n\nThe Ike & Tina Turner Revue achieved mainstream success in the late 1960s, with hits like \"River Deep – Mountain High\" (1966) and \"Proud Mary\" (1971). They became one of the most popular and influential acts of the decade, touring with artists like The Rolling Stones and The Who. In 1971, Turner and Ike released their most successful album to date, \"Nuff Said,\" which included the hit single \"I've Been Loving You Too Long.\"\n\n#### Split: 1976\n\nThe marriage between Ike and Tina Turner began to unravel in the early 1970s. Ike's increasing substance abuse and controlling behavior led to a series of publicized incidents, including a highly publicized beating in 1976. The two eventually divorced, and Turner left the Ike & Tina Turner Revue, embarking on a solo career.\n\n**Solo Career**\n\n#### Early Solo Career: 1976–1982\n\nTurner's solo career began with her debut album, \"Tina Turns the Country On!\" (1974), which met with moderate success. However, it was her 1979 album, \"Love Explosion,\" that marked a significant turning point, featuring the hit single \"Nutbush City Limits.\" The album's success led to a string of sold-out tours and a renewed focus on Turner's songwriting and solo performance.\n\n#### Career Resurgence and Superstardom: 1983–2000\n\nIn 1983, Turner released her breakthrough album, \"Private Dancer,\" which included the iconic hits \"What's Love Got to Do with It\" and \"Better Be Good to Me.\" The album earned Turner her first two Grammy Awards and solidified her position as a solo superstar. Over the next two decades, Turner released a string of successful albums, including \"Break Every Rule\" (1986) and \"Foreign Affair\" (1989), and embarked on a series of sold-out tours.\n\n#### Later Career: 2001–2021\n\nIn the 2000s, Turner continued to tour and release new music, including the album \"Twenty Four Seven\" (1999) and a live album, \"Tina!: Live in Concert\" (2009). In 2013, Turner announced her retirement from touring, citing her age and health concerns. However, she continued to perform sporadically, including a 2019 tour with her longtime collaborator, Chris Isaak.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\n#### Relationships and Marriages\n\nTurner's personal life has been marked by several high-profile relationships and marriages. In the early 1970s, she began a romantic relationship with actor Dwight Sills, but the two eventually parted ways. In 1972, Turner married Ike Turner, with whom she had a tumultuous relationship marked by substance abuse and domestic violence. The two divorced in 1976.\n\nIn the 1980s, Turner began a romantic relationship with German music executive Erwin Bach, whom she married in 2013. The couple remains together to this day.\n\n#### Children\n\nTurner has no biological children, but she has been a godmother to several family friends and has spoken publicly about her desire to adopt children.\n\n#### Religious Beliefs\n\nTurner has been open about her Christian faith, often incorporating spiritual themes into her music and performances. In 2013, she made headlines for her public endorsement of same-sex marriage.\n\n#### Residences, Citizenship, and Wealth\n\nTurner has lived in several countries throughout her career, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland. In 2013, she announced her intention to renounce her U.S. citizenship, citing tax concerns. The move was met with controversy, with some critics accusing Turner of tax evasion.\n\nAs of 2020, Turner's net worth is estimated to be over $250 million, making her one of the wealthiest musicians of all time.\n\n**Illness and Death**\n\nIn 2021, Turner announced that she was battling a rare intestinal disease, which had been diagnosed in the spring of 2021. The news sparked widespread concern and well-wishes from fans and fellow artists. As of this writing, Turner remains under medical care, and her condition is not publicly disclosed.\n\n**Musical Legacy and Accolades**\n\nTurner's impact on music is immeasurable, with a career spanning over six decades. She has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice, once with Ike Turner and again as a solo artist. In 2019, she was awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\nThroughout her career, Turner has released over 20 studio albums, sold over 100 million records worldwide, and performed to sold-out crowds on every continent. Her influence can be seen in countless artists, from Janet Jackson to Beyoncé, who have cited Turner as an inspiration.\n\n**Discography**\n\n#### Studio Albums\n\n1. Tina Turns the Country On!

This movement has its roots in the Protestant Reformation and has been shaped by various historical and theological developments.\n\n# History and Main Leaders\n\nReformed fundamentalism emerged in the early 20th century, particularly in the United States, in response to the perceived liberalization of mainline Protestantism. The movement was influenced by the fundamentalist-modernist controversy, which saw conservative Christians rejecting the theological and cultural liberalism of the time. Key leaders of the Reformed fundamentalist movement include:\n\n*  J. Gresham Machen, a Presbyterian theologian who argued for the importance of biblical inerrancy and the rejection of liberal theology.\n*  Carl McIntire, a Presbyterian pastor and theologian who advocated for a strict separation of church and state and the rejection of ecumenism.\n*  Francis Schaeffer, a Presbyterian pastor and theologian who emphasized the importance of biblical inerrancy and the need for Christians to be engaged in the culture.\n\n# Theological Distinctives\n\nReformed fundamentalism is characterized by several key theological distinctives, which are rooted in a commitment to the authority of Scripture and the principles of the Protestant Reformation.\n\n## Broader Conservative Evangelicalism\n\nReformed fundamentalism is part of a broader conservative evangelical movement, which emphasizes the importance of biblical authority and the need for Christians to be engaged in evangelism and missions.\n\n### Pertaining to Salvation and the Gospel\n\nReformed fundamentalists believe that salvation is a sovereign work of God, accomplished through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. They emphasize the importance of the gospel message, which is understood to be the central message of the Bible.\n\n### Other Fundamental Protestant and Biblical Theology\n\nReformed fundamentalists also emphasize the importance of traditional Protestant and biblical theology, including the doctrine of the Trinity, the authority of Scripture, and the importance of justification by faith alone.\n\n## The Inspiration and Preservation of the Scriptures\n\nReformed fundamentalists believe that the Bible is inspired by God and that its original manuscripts were preserved through the work of the Holy Spirit. They emphasize the importance of verbal plenary inspiration, which holds that the Bible is inspired by God in both its original languages and its overall content.\n\n### Verbal Plenary Inspiration\n\nThe doctrine of verbal plenary inspiration holds that the Bible is inspired by God in both its original languages and its overall content. This means that every word, phrase, and sentence of the Bible is considered to be inspired by God and is therefore authoritative.\n\n### Preservation of the Texts of Scripture\n\nReformed fundamentalists believe that the original manuscripts of the Bible were preserved through the work of the Holy Spirit. They emphasize the importance of using manuscripts that are considered to be the most reliable and authentic, such as the Byzantine Received Text.\n\n## Common Principles of Reformation Evangelical Interpretation and Private Reading\n\nReformed fundamentalists emphasize the importance of private reading and interpretation of Scripture, which is understood to be a fundamental principle of the Protestant Reformation. They believe that individuals should read and interpret the Bible for themselves, rather than relying on external authorities or traditions.\n\n## The Classical Creeds and Reformational Confessions\n\nReformed fundamentalists place a high value on the classical creeds and Reformational confessions, which are considered to be authoritative statements of Christian doctrine. They believe that these creeds and confessions provide a framework for understanding and interpreting the Bible.\n\n# Congregational Practices\n\nReformed fundamentalist churches often emphasize the importance of traditional congregational practices, such as:\n\n*  The importance of the local church as the primary institution for Christian worship and service.\n*  The importance of the sacraments, particularly baptism and the Lord's Supper.\n*  The importance of biblical preaching and teaching.\n*  The importance of congregational singing and worship.\n\n# Bible Translation and Usage\n\nReformed fundamentalists place a high value on the Bible as the inspired Word of God, and therefore emphasize the importance of using reliable and accurate translations.\n\n## The Authorized Version Tradition, the Byzantine Received Text, and Eastern (Greek) and Western (Greco-Latin) Ecclesiastical Translation Traditions\n\nReformed fundamentalists have traditionally emphasized the importance of the Authorized Version (also known as the King James Version) and the Byzantine Received Text, which are considered to be reliable and authoritative translations.\n\n## Modern Versions, Denominational Preferences and Translation Controversies\n\nIn recent years, Reformed fundamentalists have been involved in debates over the use of modern translations, such as the New International Version (NIV) and the English Standard Version (ESV). Some Reformed fundamentalists have expressed concerns about the accuracy and faithfulness of these translations, while others have argued that they are reliable and useful for evangelism and discipleship.\n\n# Evangelical and Missional Apologetics\n\nReformed fundamentalists emphasize the importance of evangelism and missions, and have developed various apologetic strategies to engage with modern culture and intellectual unbelief.\n\n## Bible Apologetics\n\nReformed fundamentalists have developed a range of apologetic strategies to engage with modern culture and intellectual unbelief. They emphasize the importance of biblical apologetics, which seeks to demonstrate the truth and reliability of the Bible through logical and biblical reasoning.\n\n# Liberal-Modernist Challenge to Verbal Inspiration and Truthfulness of Scripture\n\nReformed fundamentalists have faced a challenge from liberal-modernist theology, which has questioned the authority and reliability of Scripture.\n\n# Modern Biblical Criticism\n\nReformed fundamentalists have also faced a challenge from modern biblical criticism, which has questioned the accuracy and historical reliability of the biblical text.\n\n# Modern Western Society and Intellectual Unbelief\n\nReformed fundamentalists have faced a challenge from modern Western society, which has increasingly rejected traditional Christian values and beliefs.\n\n## Criticism of New-Neo Evangelicalism and the 'Present Downgrade'\n\nSome Reformed fundamentalists have criticized the New-Neo Evangelical movement, which they see as compromising on traditional Christian doctrine and practice.\n\n## Materialist and Naturalist Unbelief, and Historic Adamism and Creationism\n\nReformed fundamentalists have also faced a challenge from materialist and naturalist unbelief, which rejects the idea of a supernatural creator and the historicity of Adam and Eve.\n\n# See Also\n\n*  Fundamentalism\n*  Evangelicalism\n*  Protestant Reformation\n*  Bible\n*  Theology\n*  Apologetics\n*  Missions\n\n# Resources\n\n*  J.

With a rich and diverse history spanning over 10,000 years, Turkey is a country of strategic importance, bridging the continents of Europe and Asia. Home to over 84 million people, Turkey is the world's 17th most populous country and the 2nd largest economy in the Middle East. From its ancient civilizations to its modern-day cultural and economic achievements, Turkey has become a significant player in global politics, economy, and culture.\n\n**Etymology**\n-------------\n\nThe name \"Turkey\" is derived from the Middle English word \"Turke,\" which was used to refer to the Turkic peoples who founded the Seljuk and Ottoman empires. The term \"Türkiye\" is the Turkish spelling of the country's name, which was adopted in 1923, after the establishment of the modern Republic of Turkey.\n\n**History**\n----------\n\n### Prehistory and ancient history\n\nThe region now known as Turkey has been inhabited by humans since the Paleolithic era. The earliest known human settlement in Turkey dates back to around 10,000 BCE, during the Neolithic Age. The region was home to various ancient civilizations, including the Hittites, Lydians, Phrygians, and Ionians. The ancient city of Troy, which was the setting of Homer's epic poem, the Iliad, is believed to be located in northwest Turkey.\n\n### Early classical antiquity\n\nIn the 8th century BCE, the region was conquered by the Lydians, who established the city of Lydia, which became a major power in the region. The Lydians were eventually conquered by the Persians in the 6th century BCE. The Persian Empire, under the rule of Cyrus the Great, expanded into the region, which became a major center of Persian culture and trade.\n\n### Rome and Byzantine Empire\n\nIn the 1st century BCE, the Romans conquered the region, which became a Roman province. The Romans introduced their language, culture, and architecture to the region, which had a lasting impact on the development of Turkish culture. The region was later conquered by the Byzantine Empire, which was the Eastern Roman Empire.\n\n### Seljuks and Anatolian beyliks\n\nIn the 11th century CE, the Seljuk Turks, a Turkish tribe from Central Asia, conquered the region and established the Seljuk Empire. The Seljuks established the city of Konya, which became a major center of Turkish culture and learning. The Seljuk Empire was eventually divided into various Anatolian beyliks, which were Turkish principalities that ruled over the region.\n\n### Ottoman Empire\n\nIn the 13th century CE, the Ottoman Turks, a Turkish tribe from Central Asia, conquered the region and established the Ottoman Empire. The Ottoman Empire expanded into the region, which became a major center of Ottoman culture and trade. The Ottoman Empire was eventually dissolved after World War I, and the modern Republic of Turkey was established in 1923.\n\n### Republic of Türkiye\n\nThe modern Republic of Turkey was established in 1923 by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, who became the country's first president. The new government introduced a series of reforms, including the adoption of the Latin alphabet, the introduction of secular education, and the promotion of women's rights. The country has since undergone significant economic and social reforms, and has become a significant player in global politics and economy.\n\n**Administrative divisions**\n---------------------------\n\nTurkey is divided into 81 provinces (iller), which are further divided into districts (ilçeler).

His ideas had a profound impact on Western philosophy and continue to influence contemporary thought.\n\n# Life\n\nHeraclitus was born in Ephesus, a city in ancient Ionia, into a noble family. Little is known about his personal life, but it is believed that he held significant social and economic power. He is said to have traveled extensively, including to the Persian Empire, where he may have come into contact with various philosophical and cultural influences. Heraclitus is thought to have lived a reclusive life, devoting himself to his philosophical pursuits.\n\n# On Nature\n\n## Structure\n\nHeraclitus' philosophical ideas can be understood through the structure of his writing. His works consist of short, aphoristic statements, often in the form of contradictions or paradoxes. These statements are meant to provoke thought and challenge his readers to think critically about the nature of reality. Heraclitus' style is characterized by a sense of ambiguity and complexity, making it difficult to pin down a single, coherent message.\n\n## Style\n\n### The Obscure\n\nHeraclitus' writing style is often described as obscure, fragmented, and difficult to understand. This has led some interpreters to suggest that his ideas are intentionally complex, designed to challenge and provoke his readers. Others have argued that his writing is simply the product of a unique cultural and intellectual context, one that is foreign to modern readers.\n\n# Philosophy\n\n## Unity of opposites and flux\n\nHeraclitus is perhaps best known for his concept of the unity of opposites, which posits that all things are interconnected and inseparable. He famously stated that \"no man ever steps in the same river twice, for it's not the same river and he's not the same man.\" This idea is closely related to his concept of flux, or the notion that all things are in a state of constant change.\n\n### Panta rhei\n\nThe Greek phrase \"panta rhei\" (everything flows) is a central concept in Heraclitus' philosophy. He believed that all things are in a state of constant flux, and that this flux is the fundamental nature of reality. This idea challenges traditional notions of stability and permanence, suggesting that everything is constantly changing and evolving.\n\n### You cannot step into the same river twice\n\nThis famous phrase, mentioned earlier, is a key example of Heraclitus' concept of flux. It suggests that even in a seemingly static entity like a river, change is always occurring. This idea has far-reaching implications for our understanding of the world and our place within it.\n\n### Strife is justice\n\nHeraclitus also believed that strife is a necessary and just aspect of the natural world. He saw conflict and tension as driving forces that shape the universe and bring about change. This idea challenges traditional notions of harmony and balance, suggesting that these concepts may be illusions.\n\n## Logos\n\nHeraclitus believed that logos, or reason, is the fundamental principle of the universe. He saw logos as a unifying force that underlies all things, a force that brings order and meaning to the world. This idea is closely related to his concept of the unity of opposites, which suggests that all things are interconnected and inseparable.\n\n## Fire\n\n### Fire as symbolic\n\nFire is a recurring symbol in Heraclitus' philosophy, representing the fundamental forces of nature and the cycle of birth, growth, and decay. He saw fire as a symbol of the creative and destructive forces that shape the universe, and as a reminder of the constant flux and change that underlies all things.\n\n## Cosmology\n\n### Sun\n\nHeraclitus believed that the sun is a symbol of the divine and the ultimate source of all life and energy. He saw the sun as a reminder of the cyclical nature of time, with its constant rising and setting a metaphor for the eternal cycle of birth, growth, and decay.\n\n### Moon\n\nThe moon, on the other hand, is seen as a symbol of the feminine and the receptive. Heraclitus believed that the moon is a reminder of the passive and receptive aspects of the universe, and of the importance of balance and harmony in the natural world.\n\n## God\n\nHeraclitus did not believe in a personal god or a divine creator. Instead, he saw the universe as a unified, interconnected whole, governed by the principles of logos and the natural order. He believed that the universe is self-contained and self-sufficient, with no need for external intervention or guidance.\n\n## The Soul\n\nHeraclitus believed that the soul is an extension of the natural world, and that it is subject to the same laws and principles that govern the universe. He saw the soul as a spark of the divine, a fragment of the universal logos that animates all things.\n\n## Foreign influence\n\n### Persia\n\nHeraclitus is believed to have traveled to the Persian Empire, where he may have come into contact with various philosophical and cultural influences. Some interpreters have suggested that his ideas were influenced by the teachings of the Persian prophet Zarathustra (Zoroaster).\n\n### India\n\nHeraclitus' ideas have also been compared to those of ancient Indian philosophers, such as the Buddha and the Upanishads. Some interpreters have suggested that his concept of the unity of opposites and the cyclical nature of time are similar to those found in ancient Indian thought.\n\n### Egypt\n\nHeraclitus' ideas have also been compared to those of ancient Egyptian philosophers, such as Hermes Trismegistus. Some interpreters have suggested that his concept of the unity of opposites and the cyclical nature of time are similar to those found in ancient Egyptian thought.\n\n# Legacy\n\n## Ancient\n\n### Pre-Socratics\n\nHeraclitus was a key figure in the development of pre-Socratic philosophy, which laid the groundwork for Western philosophy. His ideas influenced later pre-Socratic philosophers, such as Parmenides and Empedocles.\n\n#### Eleatics\n\nThe Eleatics, a school of philosophers from Elea, were influenced by Heraclitus' ideas on the unity of opposites and the cyclical nature of time. Parmenides' concept of the unity of being and non-being is similar to Heraclitus' concept of the unity of opposites.\n\n#### Pluralists and atomists\n\nThe pluralists and atomists, such as Empedocles and Leucippus, were also influenced by Heraclitus' ideas on the cyclical nature of time and the unity of opposites. Empedocles' concept of the four elements and the cyclical nature of time is similar to Heraclitus' ideas on the unity of opposites and the cyclical nature of time.\n\n#### Sophists\n\nThe Sophists, a group of philosophers who focused on rhetoric and argumentation, were influenced by Heraclitus' ideas on the importance of language and the role of the individual in shaping reality. Protagoras' concept of the individual's subjective experience is similar to Heraclitus' ideas on the importance of individual perception.\n\n### Classical and Hellenistic philosophy\n\n#### Stoics\n\nThe Stoics, a school of philosophers who emphasized reason and self-control, were influenced by Heraclitus' ideas on the unity of opposites and the cyclical nature of time. Epictetus' concept of the unity of being and non-being is similar to Heraclitus' concept of the unity of opposites.\n\n#### Cynics\n\nThe Cynics, a school of philosophers who emphasized the importance of living in accordance with nature, were influenced by Heraclitus' ideas on the importance of individual perception and the role of the individual in shaping reality. Diogenes' concept of the individual's subjective experience is similar to Heraclitus' ideas on the importance of individual perception.\n\n#### Pyrrhonists\n\nThe Pyrrhonists, a school of philosophers who emphasized the importance of skepticism and doubt, were influenced by Heraclitus' ideas on the cyclical nature of time and the unity of opposites. Sextus Empiricus' concept of the cyclical nature of time is similar to Heraclitus' ideas on the cyclical nature of time.\n\n### Early Christianity\n\nHeraclitus' ideas on the unity of opposites and the cyclical nature of time influenced early Christian thought, particularly in the writings of Origen and Gregory of Nyssa. The concept of the unity of opposites is similar to the Christian concept of the unity of being and non-being.\n\n### Weeping philosopher\n\nHeraclitus' reputation as a weeping philosopher, who wept for the suffering of humanity, has been noted by various interpreters. This reputation has led some to speculate about his personal life and emotional state.\n\n## Modern\n\n### Rationalism\n\nHeraclitus' ideas on the importance of reason and the role of the individual in shaping reality influenced modern rationalist philosophers, such as René Descartes and John Locke.\n\n### British empiricism\n\n#### Common sense\n\nBritish empiricist philosophers, such as David Hume and Thomas Reid, were influenced by Heraclitus' ideas on the importance of individual perception and the role of the individual in shaping reality. Hume's concept of common sense is similar to Heraclitus' ideas on the importance of individual perception.\n\n### Post-Kantianism\n\n#### Heraclitean studies\n\nPost-Kantian philosophers, such as Friedrich Nietzsche and Martin Heidegger, were influenced by Heraclitus' ideas on the cyclical nature of time and the unity of opposites. Nietzsche's concept of the eternal recurrence is similar to Heraclitus' ideas on the cyclical nature of time.\n\n### Continental\n\nContinental philosophers, such as Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir, were influenced by Heraclitus' ideas on the importance of individual freedom and the role of the individual in shaping reality. Sartre's concept of existentialism is similar to Heraclitus' ideas on the importance of individual freedom.\n\n### Analytic\n\n#### Wittgenstein\n\nAnalytic philosophers, such as Ludwig Wittgenstein and J.L. Austin, were influenced by Heraclitus' ideas on the importance of language and the role of the individual in shaping reality. Wittgenstein's concept of language games is similar to Heraclitus' ideas on the importance of language and individual perception.\n\n#### Contradiction\n\nAnalytic philosophers, such as Karl Popper and Paul Feyerabend, were influenced by Heraclitus' ideas on the cyclical nature of time and the unity of opposites. Popper's concept of the importance of contradiction is similar to Heraclitus' ideas on the cyclical nature of time.\n\n#### Philosophy of Religion\n\nAnalytic philosophers, such as Alvin Plantinga and William Alston, were influenced by Heraclitus' ideas on the importance of individual freedom and the role of the individual in shaping reality. Plantinga's concept of religious epistemology is similar to Heraclitus' ideas on the importance of individual perception and the role of the individual in shaping reality.\n\n#### Philosophy of Time\n\nAnalytic philosophers, such as J.J.C. Smart and Hilary Putnam, were influenced by Heraclitus' ideas on the cyclical nature of time and the unity of opposites. Smart's concept of the block universe theory is similar to Heraclitus' ideas on the cyclical nature of time.\n\n# Notes\n\n## Explanatory notes\n\nThis article provides an overview of Heraclitus' philosophical ideas and legacy.

This article provides an overview of the incident, its background, and the subsequent investigations and reactions.\n\n**Background**\n\n**OceanGate**\n\nOceanGate, Inc. is a private company based in the United States that specializes in submersible vessel design and operation. The company claims to be the world's leading provider of manned submersible services for commercial and scientific purposes. OceanGate has been involved in several high-profile projects, including the exploration of the Titanic wreck site.\n\n**Titanic**\n\nThe RMS Titanic was a British passenger liner that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean on April 15, 1912, after colliding with an iceberg during its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. The ship's sinking resulted in the loss of over 1,500 lives and became one of the most infamous maritime disasters in history. The wreck of the Titanic was discovered on September 1, 1985, by a team led by Robert Ballard.\n\n**Submersible Titan**\n\nThe Titan submersible was a deep-sea vessel designed and operated by OceanGate for the purpose of exploring the Titanic wreck site. The submersible was a type of bathyscaphe, a deep-diving submersible that can operate at extreme depths. The Titan submersible was certified to dive to depths of up to 6,300 meters (20,700 feet).\n\n**Dives to wreck of Titanic**\n\nThe Titan submersible made several dives to the wreck of the Titanic as part of a tourist expedition. The submersible was equipped with a viewport, where passengers could observe the wreck site, and a communication system that allowed them to stay in touch with the support vessel. The dives were part of a commercial expedition that involved paying customers.\n\n**Safety**\n\nThe Titan submersible was designed to be a safe vessel for deep-sea exploration. The submersible was equipped with a series of safety features, including a backup power system, a emergency oxygen supply, and a communication system. The submersible also had a pressure hull that was designed to withstand the extreme pressures of the deep ocean.\n\n**Prior concerns**\n\nThere were prior concerns about the safety of the Titan submersible. In 2022, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) issued a statement warning about the risks of deep-sea submersibles, including the Titan. The NOAA cited the risks of equipment failure, human error, and the unpredictable nature of the deep ocean.\n\n**Previous incidents**\n\nThere were previous incidents involving the Titan submersible. In 2020, the submersible experienced a minor malfunction during a dive to the Titanic wreck site. The incident was reported by OceanGate, but the company did not provide further details.\n\n**Incident**\n\n**Expedition arrangements**\n\nThe Titan submersible was part of a larger expedition to the Titanic wreck site, which involved several support vessels and a team of scientists and engineers. The expedition was sponsored by OceanGate and involved paying customers who had paid thousands of dollars to participate in the dive.\n\n**16–17 June preparations**\n\nThe Titan submersible arrived on site on June 16, 2023, and began preparations for the dive. The submersible was loaded with supplies, including food, water, and communication equipment. The support vessel, the Titan's support ship, the \"Polar Prince\", was also on site and ready to provide assistance during the dive.\n\n**18 June, dive, disappearance, and implosion**\n\nThe Titan submersible began its dive to the Titanic wreck site on June 18, 2023. The submersible was accompanied by a team of scientists and engineers on the support vessel. During the dive, the submersible experienced a catastrophic failure, resulting in a rapid loss of pressure. The submersible imploded, killing all five people on board.\n\n**18–22 June, search and rescue efforts**\n\nA search and rescue operation was launched immediately after the submersible's disappearance. The support vessel, the \"Polar Prince\", was joined by several other vessels, including a US Navy ship, the USS Sirocco, and a Canadian Coast Guard ship, the CCGS John G. Diefenbaker. The search effort involved a thorough scan of the seafloor using sonar and other equipment.\n\n**22 June, discovery of debris**\n\nOn June 22, 2023, a piece of debris from the Titan submersible was discovered on the seafloor, approximately 1,000 meters (3,300 feet) from the Titanic wreck site. The debris was identified as a section of the submersible's hull.\n\n**Fatalities**\n\nFive people were killed in the incident, including:\n\n* Stockton Rush, CEO of OceanGate\n* Hamish Harding, a British businessman and adventurer\n* Paul-Henri Nargeolet, a French engineer and Titanic expert\n* Shahzada Dawood, a British-Pakistani businessman and philanthropist\n* Suleman Dawood, Shahzada Dawood's son\n\n**Recovery operations**\n\nThe recovery of the submersible's wreckage was a complex and challenging operation. The wreckage was located on the seafloor, approximately 1,000 meters (3,300 feet) from the Titanic wreck site. The recovery effort involved several vessels, including the \"Polar Prince\" and the USS Sirocco.\n\n**Investigations**\n\nThe incident was investigated by both the United States and Canada. The US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and the Canadian Transportation Safety Board (TSB) led the investigations. The investigations focused on the design and operation of the submersible, as well as the safety procedures in place during the dive.\n\n**United States**\n\nThe US NTSB is responsible for investigating accidents involving commercial vessels in US waters. The NTSB investigation into the Titan submersible implosion is ongoing.\n\n**Canada**\n\nThe Canadian TSB is responsible for investigating accidents involving Canadian-registered vessels. The TSB investigation into the Titan submersible implosion is also ongoing.\n\n**Lawsuit**\n\nA lawsuit was filed on behalf of the families of the victims against OceanGate and several other companies involved in the expedition. The lawsuit alleges that the companies were negligent in their design and operation of the submersible, and that they failed to take adequate safety precautions during the dive.\n\n**Financial costs of operations**\n\nThe financial costs of the operation were significant. The recovery of the submersible's wreckage required several vessels and a team of experts, and the cost of the operation was estimated to be in the millions of dollars.\n\n**Reactions**\n\nThe incident was met with shock and outrage from the public and the scientific community. Many people expressed concerns about the safety of deep-sea submersibles and the risks of exploring the deep ocean.\n\n**In social and mass media**\n\nThe incident was widely covered in social and mass media, including news outlets, social media platforms, and online forums. The hashtag #TitanSubmersible was trending on Twitter, with many people expressing their condolences to the families of the victims.\n\n**See also**\n\n* OceanGate\n* Titanic\n* Deep-sea submersible\n* Manned submersible\n* Pressure hull\n* Emergency oxygen supply\n* Communication system\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is based on publicly available information and may not reflect the most up-to-date information.\n* The investigation into the incident is ongoing, and this article may be updated as new information becomes available.\n\n**References**\n\n* This article does not include any references, as it is based on publicly available information.\n\n**External links**\n\n* OceanGate\n* National Transportation Safety Board\n* Canadian Transportation Safety Board\n* Titanic\n* Deep-sea submersible\n* Manned submersible\n* Pressure hull\n* Emergency oxygen supply\n* Communication system", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

It refers to films that are produced outside of the traditional major Hollywood studios, but have a budget and production values that are higher than those of traditional independent films. Indiewood films often have a more polished and commercial appeal, but still maintain some of the creative freedom and autonomy that is characteristic of independent filmmaking.\n\nBackground\n------------\n\nThe term \"Indiewood\" was first coined in the 1990s to describe a new wave of independent films that were being produced in Los Angeles. These films were not quite big-budget Hollywood productions, but were also not small, low-budget indie films. Instead, they fell somewhere in between, with a budget that was typically between $1 million and $20 million.\n\nOne of the key factors that contributed to the emergence of Indiewood was the rise of the Sundance Film Festival in the 1980s and 1990s. The festival provided a platform for independent filmmakers to showcase their work and connect with industry professionals, and it helped to establish a network of filmmakers and producers who were looking to create more sophisticated and commercial independent films.\n\nDivisions\n------------\n\nIndiewood films can be divided into several subcategories. Some of the main divisions include:\n\n## Pre-Indiewood\n\nPre-Indiewood refers to the early days of independent filmmaking in the United States, before the emergence of Indiewood as a distinct genre. During this time, independent films were often produced on low budgets and had a more raw and experimental feel. Some notable filmmakers who worked in the pre-Indiewood era include John Cassavetes, Elia Kazan, and Orson Welles.\n\n## Art House\n\nArt house films are a type of Indiewood film that focuses on experimental and avant-garde storytelling. They often have a more abstract and introspective tone, and may feature non-traditional narrative structures and visual styles. Art house films may be more challenging to watch than mainstream Hollywood films, but they often provide a unique and thought-provoking viewing experience.\n\n## Mumblecore\n\nMumblecore is a subgenre of Indiewood films that emerged in the 2000s. Mumblecore films are characterized by their low-budget production values, naturalistic dialogue, and focus on character-driven storytelling. They often feature young, upwardly mobile professionals navigating the challenges of adulthood, and may explore themes such as relationships, identity, and social status.\n\nOther \"mini-major\" subdivisions/indie distributors\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nIn addition to the main divisions of Indiewood, there are several other \"mini-major\" subdivisions and indie distributors that are worth noting. Some of these include:\n\n## Miramax\n\nMiramax is a film production and distribution company that was founded in the 1970s. Miramax is known for producing and distributing a wide range of films, including some of the most successful and critically acclaimed Indiewood films of all time.\n\n## New Line Cinema\n\nNew Line Cinema is a film production and distribution company that was founded in the 1960s.

The history of fantasy is a complex and multifaceted narrative that spans multiple continents and civilizations. This article provides an overview of the development of fantasy as a distinct genre, from its early beginnings to its modern forms.\n\n**Differences between fantasy and earlier fantastic works**\n\nOne of the key challenges in tracing the history of fantasy is distinguishing it from earlier forms of fantastic literature and art. Fantastic elements, such as supernatural creatures and magical powers, have been present in human storytelling since ancient times. However, the modern concept of fantasy as a distinct genre emerged in the 19th century, with the development of Romances, Science Fiction, and other related genres.\n\nIn ancient Greece and Rome, myths and legends featured gods, goddesses, and supernatural beings, but these works were not necessarily considered \"fantasy\" in the modern sense. Similarly, medieval European literature, such as Arthurian Romances and the works of Geoffrey Chaucer, featured magical and supernatural elements, but these were often embedded in a historical or allegorical context. The modern concept of fantasy as a self-contained, imaginative world, separate from historical or scientific reality, emerged only in the 19th century.\n\n**Development of fantasy**\n\n### **Romances**\n\nRomances, also known as chivalric romances, were a popular literary form in medieval Europe, particularly in England and France. These works often featured magical and supernatural elements, such as enchantments, prophecies, and propitiatory rituals. However, these elements were usually embedded in a historical or allegorical context, and the primary focus was on the heroic exploits of the protagonist.\n\nOne of the most famous examples of a medieval Romance is Sir Thomas Malory's \"Le Morte d'Arthur\", which features King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. While the work is full of magical and supernatural elements, such as Merlin's prophecies and the Lady of the Lake's magical powers, these are presented as part of a historical or allegorical narrative.\n\n### **The Enlightenment**\n\nThe Enlightenment, which spanned the 17th and 18th centuries, marked a significant shift in the development of fantasy. During this period, there was a growing interest in reason, science, and empirical knowledge. This led to a decline in the popularity of medieval-style Romances and a rise in more rational and scientific forms of literature.\n\nHowever, this period also saw the emergence of new forms of fantasy, such as the Gothic novel. Gothic novels, such as Ann Radcliffe's \"The Mysteries of Udolpho\", featured elements of horror, the supernatural, and the irrational, but were presented in a more rational and scientific context.\n\n### **Romanticism**\n\nRomanticism, which emerged in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, marked a significant shift in the development of fantasy. Romantics emphasized the importance of imagination, emotion, and individualism, and often featured magical and supernatural elements in their works.\n\nOne of the key figures of Romanticism was the German writer E.T.A. Hoffmann, who wrote a series of fantastical tales, such as \"The Sand-Man\" and \"The Golden Pot\". These works featured elements of horror, the supernatural, and the irrational, but were presented in a more imaginative and emotional context.\n\n**Modern fantasy**\n\n### **Pre-Tolkien**\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, fantasy began to emerge as a distinct genre. This period saw the emergence of new forms of fantasy, such as the fantasy short story and the fantasy novel.\n\nOne of the key figures of this period was the American writer L. Frank Baum, who wrote a series of fantasy novels, including \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\". These works featured elements of magic, adventure, and fantasy, but were presented in a more rational and scientific context.\n\n### **Tolkien**\n\nJ.R.R. Tolkien, a British scholar and writer, is widely regarded as one of the most influential fantasy writers of the 20th century. His novel \"The Lord of the Rings\" (1954-55) is considered a landmark work of fantasy, and has had a profound impact on the genre.\n\nTolkien's work is characterized by its detailed world-building, complex mythology, and epic scope. His invented languages, such as Elvish and Dwarvish, are also notable for their complexity and beauty.\n\nTolkien's influence on the fantasy genre cannot be overstated. His work has inspired countless other writers, artists, and creators, and has helped to shape the modern concept of fantasy as we know it today.\n\n### **Post-Tolkien**\n\nIn the decades following Tolkien's major works, fantasy continued to evolve and diversify. This period saw the emergence of new sub-genres, such as urban fantasy, dark fantasy, and epic fantasy.\n\nOne of the key figures of this period is the American writer Neil Gaiman, who has written a series of fantasy novels, including \"Good Omens\" and \"American Gods\". Gaiman's work is characterized by its blend of fantasy, horror, and mythology, and has had a significant impact on the genre.\n\nModern fantasy is a diverse and complex genre, with a wide range of styles, themes, and sub-genres. From the epic fantasies of Tolkien to the urban fantasies of Gaiman, modern fantasy continues to evolve and thrive, offering endless possibilities for creators and readers alike.\n\n**References**\n\nFor further reading, see the following:\n\n* \"The Oxford Handbook of Fantasy Literature\" edited by Farah Mendlesohn and Edward James\n* \"The Cambridge Companion to Fantasy Literature\" edited by Edward James and Farah Mendlesohn\n* \"The Fantasy Reader: From Classical to Contemporary\" edited by Tom Shippey\n* \"The Encyclopedia of Fantasy\" edited by John Clute and John Grant\n\nNote: The references listed above are not actual citations, but rather a list of suggested sources for further reading.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

substitution**\n-----------------------------------\n\nSome sports have limited substitution policies, where teams are only allowed to make a certain number of substitutions during the game.\n\n### Sports that allow a limited number of substitutions\n\nCertain sports allow teams to make a limited number of substitutions during the game, with the goal of promoting a more strategic and tactical

only allowed to replace injured players, with the goal of promoting player safety and minimizing the risk of injury.\n\nThese sports often have a high risk of injury, and substitution policies are in place to ensure player safety.\n\n**Sports with mixed or hybrid systems**\n--------------------------------------\n\nSome sports have mixed or hybrid substitution systems, where teams are allowed to make different numbers of substitutions during different periods of the game.\n\n*   **Tennis**: In tennis, teams are allowed to make a limited number of substitutions during the first set, but unlimited substitutions during the second and third sets.\n*   **Volleyball**: Volleyball teams are also allowed to make a limited number of substitutions during the first set, but unlimited

The strike began on July 14, 2023, and lasted for 45 days, with millions of workers in the entertainment industry participating.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike was the first major labor dispute in the American entertainment industry in over two decades. The strike was sparked by disagreements over wages, working conditions, and benefits for SAG-AFTRA members. The dispute highlighted the growing tensions between the entertainment industry and its workforce, as well as the increasing importance of labor unions in the sector.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Unionization in Hollywood\n\nThe Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) is one of the largest labor unions in the American entertainment industry. Founded in 1933, the union represents over 160,000 members, including actors, musicians, singers, and other performers. SAG-AFTRA's primary mission is to protect the rights and interests of its members, including fair wages, safe working conditions, and benefits.\n\n### Pre-strike activity\n\nIn the months leading up to the strike, SAG-AFTRA members expressed growing frustration with the entertainment industry's treatment of workers. Many members felt that they were not being fairly compensated for their work, and that the industry was prioritizing profits over people. In response, SAG-AFTRA leaders began to mobilize members for a potential strike.\n\n**Timeline**\n\n### July\n\nOn July 14, 2023, SAG-AFTRA members voted to authorize a strike. The vote was largely expected, as many members had expressed support for a walkout in the months leading up to the vote. The same day, SAG-AFTRA leaders announced that the union would begin its strike immediately.\n\n### August\n\nIn the first week of August, SAG-AFTRA members began to picket outside major studios in Los Angeles and New York. The pickets were peaceful, with members carrying signs and distributing flyers to passersby. Meanwhile, industry executives began to speak out against the strike, arguing that it would harm the economy and damage the entertainment industry.\n\n### September\n\nAs the strike entered its second month, SAG-AFTRA members continued to picket outside studios. The union also began to target specific companies, including streaming giants Netflix and Disney+. In response, the companies began to speak out against the union, arguing that their business models were being unfairly targeted.\n\n### October\n\nIn mid-October, SAG-AFTRA leaders announced that they would be meeting with industry executives to discuss a potential settlement. The meeting was seen as a breakthrough, as it marked the first time that the two sides had spoken directly in months. However, the meeting ultimately broke down, with the union and industry executives unable to reach an agreement.\n\n### November\n\nAs the strike entered its fourth month, SAG-AFTRA members began to feel the economic effects of the dispute. Many members were forced to take on secondary jobs or go on unpaid leave, while others were forced to rely on financial assistance from the union. Industry executives, meanwhile, began to speak out against the union's tactics, arguing that they were being \"irrational\" and \"unreasonable\".\n\n### December\n\nIn December, SAG-AFTRA leaders announced that they would be calling off the strike. The decision was seen as a major victory for the union, as it marked the end of a 45-day dispute. However, the strike also highlighted the growing tensions between the entertainment industry and its workforce, and the increasing importance of labor unions in the sector.\n\n**Strike activity and responses**\n\n### Locations\n\nThe 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike took place in cities across the United States, including Los Angeles, New York, and Chicago. Members picketed outside major studios, including Warner Bros., Paramount Pictures, and Disney+. The strike also targeted streaming giants Netflix and Disney+, as well as other companies in the entertainment industry.\n\n### Media executives' response\n\nIndustry executives responded to the strike by speaking out against the union and its tactics. Many executives argued that the strike was \"unreasonable\" and \"irrational\", and that it would harm the economy and damage the entertainment industry. Some executives also began to speak out against SAG-AFTRA leaders, accusing them of being \"extremists\" and \"radicals\".\n\n### Politicians' response\n\nPoliticians responded to the strike by speaking out against the union and its tactics. Many politicians argued that the strike was \"unfair\" and \"unreasonable\", and that it would harm the economy and damage the entertainment industry. Some politicians also began to speak out against SAG-AFTRA leaders, accusing them of being \"extremists\" and \"radicals\".\n\n### Other unions' response\n\nOther unions responded to the strike by speaking out in support of SAG-AFTRA and its members. Many unions argued that the strike was justified, and that it highlighted the growing tensions between the entertainment industry and its workforce. Some unions also began to speak out against industry executives, accusing them of being \"anti-union\" and \"anti-worker\".\n\n### Other organizations' response\n\nOther organizations responded to the strike by speaking out in support of SAG-AFTRA and its members. Many organizations argued that the strike was justified, and that it highlighted the growing tensions between the entertainment industry and its workforce. Some organizations also began to speak out against industry executives, accusing them of being \"anti-union\" and \"anti-worker\".\n\n### Impact\n\nThe 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike had a significant impact on the entertainment industry, as well as on the broader economy. The strike highlighted the growing tensions between the industry and its workforce, and the increasing importance of labor unions in the sector. The strike also highlighted the need for greater fairness and equity in the industry, as well as the need for greater protections for workers.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike marked a major turning point in the entertainment industry, as it highlighted the growing tensions between the industry and its workforce. The strike also marked a major victory for SAG-AFTRA and its members, as it forced industry executives to take notice of the union's demands and to begin to negotiate in good faith.
