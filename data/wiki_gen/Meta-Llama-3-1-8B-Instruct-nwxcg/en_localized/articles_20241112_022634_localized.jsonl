It is a type of black hole that is conjectured to be the fundamental unit of information in the universe. Fuzzballs are thought to be the outcome of the collapse of matter in the universe, and they are characterized by their unique properties and behavior.\n\n**Physical properties**\n\n### String theory and composition\n\nFuzzballs are a product of string theory, a theoretical framework that attempts to reconcile quantum mechanics and general relativity. In string theory, the fundamental building blocks of the universe are not point-like particles, but tiny, vibrating strings. These strings can vibrate at different frequencies, giving rise to the various particles we observe in the universe.\n\nFuzzballs are thought to be the result of the collapse of a collection of strings into a single, compact object. This object is characterized by its high density and strong gravitational field, which are similar to those of a black hole. However, unlike traditional black holes, fuzzballs are thought to be made up of a complex, granular structure that gives rise to their unique properties.\n\n### Densities\n\nFuzzballs are incredibly dense objects, with densities that are many orders of magnitude higher than those of traditional black holes. This high density is thought to be the result of the compactification of the strings that make up the fuzzball, which creates a singularity at the center of the object.\n\nThe density of a fuzzball is so high that it is difficult to imagine the physical laws that govern its behavior. In fact, the density of a fuzzball is so high that it is thought to be the point at which the laws of physics as we know them break down.\n\n### Neutron star collapse\n\nFuzzballs are thought to be the end product of the collapse of a neutron star. A neutron star is a massive, spinning star that is composed primarily of neutrons. When a neutron star collapses, its density increases dramatically, causing it to become a black hole.\n\nHowever, if the neutron star is composed of a certain type of matter, it is thought to collapse into a fuzzball rather than a traditional black hole. This type of matter is known as \"exotic matter,\" and it has negative energy density. The collapse of exotic matter into a fuzzball is thought to be the result of a quantum phase transition, in which the matter undergoes a sudden change in its physical properties.\n\n**Information paradox**\n\nOne of the most intriguing aspects of fuzzballs is the information paradox, which arises from the fact that they are thought to be the end product of the collapse of matter in the universe. The information paradox is a fundamental problem in quantum mechanics and general relativity, and it has far-reaching implications for our understanding of the universe.\n\nIn essence, the information paradox asks the following question: What happens to the information contained in the matter that collapses into a fuzzball? In other words, what happens to the information about the matter's location, momentum, and other physical properties?\n\nThe answer to this question is not yet known, and it is the subject of much debate and research in the field of theoretical physics. However, some theories suggest that the information contained in the matter that collapses into a fuzzball is preserved in the form of a \"hologram\" on the surface of the object. This hologram is thought to be a two-dimensional representation of the information contained in the matter, and it is thought to be the result of a process known as \"holographic principle.\"\n\n**Testability of the theory**\n\nFuzzballs are a theoretical concept, and as such, they have not yet been directly observed or tested. However, the predictions of fuzzball theory are thought to be testable through a variety of experiments and observations.\n\nOne of the primary ways in which fuzzball theory can be tested is through the study of black hole physics. Black holes are thought to be the end product of the collapse of matter in the universe, and they are characterized by their strong gravitational fields and high densities.\n\nThe study of black hole physics can provide insights into the behavior of fuzzballs, and it can help to test the predictions of fuzzball theory. In particular, the study of black hole entropy, which is a measure of the amount of information contained in a black hole, can provide insights into the behavior of fuzzballs.\n\nAnother way in which fuzzball theory can be tested is through the study of gravitational waves. Gravitational waves are ripples in the fabric of spacetime that are produced by the merger of two massive objects, such as black holes or neutron stars.\n\nThe study of gravitational waves can provide insights into the behavior of fuzzballs, and it can help to test the predictions of fuzzball theory. In particular, the study of gravitational wave signals from the merger of two black holes can provide insights into the behavior of fuzzballs.\n\n**References**\n\nThis article does not include any references, as the information contained within is based on general knowledge and is not the result of specific research or studies.\n\n**External links**\n\nFor more information on fuzzballs and string theory, please see the following external links:\n\n* [String theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory)\n* [Black hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole)\n* [Gravitational wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_wave)\n* [Holographic principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holographic_principle)", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

It was held on March 9, 2022, after the incumbent President Moon Jae-in's term ended. The election was characterized by a highly competitive and divisive campaign between the two major candidates, Lee Jae-myung of the Democratic Party and Yoon Suk-yeol of the People Power Party.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe 2022 presidential election was the first in South Korean history to be held without a consensus candidate. The incumbent President Moon Jae-in, who had been in office since 2017, was ineligible to run for re-election due to the two-term limit. His party, the Democratic Party, had to choose a new candidate to represent them in the election.\n\nThe election was also notable for the emergence of a new conservative party, the People Power Party, which was formed in 2020 by a group of conservative politicians who defected from the Liberty Korea Party. The party's candidate, Yoon Suk-yeol, was a relatively unknown politician at the time, but he managed to gain significant momentum during the campaign.\n\n**Electoral system**\n\nThe presidential election in South Korea is based on a first-past-the-post system, where the candidate with the most votes wins the election. The election is held on a single day, and voters can choose from a list of registered candidates.\n\nThe electoral system in South Korea is also notable for the use of electronic voting machines, which were introduced in 2007. The machines are designed to make voting more efficient and secure, but they have also been criticized for their potential to introduce errors and manipulate the outcome of the election.\n\n**Nominations**\n\n### **Democratic Party**\n\n**Primary campaign**\n\nThe primary campaign for the Democratic Party began on February 7, 2022, with the first debate between the candidates.

The term \"tartan\" is often used to describe the pattern itself, but it can also refer to the specific weave and materials used to create the fabric.\n\n**Etymology and Terminology**\n\nThe word \"tartan\" is derived from the French word \"tartane,\" which refers to a type of striped fabric. The term has been used in the English language since the 16th century, initially to describe a wide range of striped patterns, not just those specifically associated with Scotland.\n\nIn Scotland, the term \"tartan\" is often used interchangeably with \"plaid.\" However, in the context of Scottish culture, a tartan typically refers to a specific pattern associated with a particular clan or family. In contrast, a plaid can refer to any type of striped fabric.\n\n**Weaving and Design**\n\n### Weaving Construction\n\nTartan patterns are created using a specific type of weaving construction called a \"sett.\" The sett is a grid of warp and weft yarns that are woven together to create the tartan pattern. The sett typically consists of a repeating sequence of colors, with the warp yarns forming the vertical stripes and the weft yarns forming the horizontal stripes.\n\nThe sett can be woven using a variety of techniques, including hand weaving or machine weaving. In traditional Scottish weaving, the sett is typically woven on a loom using a combination of wool and other natural fibers.\n\n### Styles and Design Principles\n\nTartan patterns can be categorized into several different styles, including:\n\n* **Modern tartans**: These are new tartan patterns that have been created in recent years. They often feature bold, bright colors and geometric patterns.\n* **Traditional tartans**: These are tartan patterns that have been associated with Scottish culture for centuries. They often feature muted colors and simple, repeating patterns.\n* **Historical tartans**: These are tartan patterns that were used in the past, but are no longer in use today. They often feature unique and exotic colors and patterns.\n\nTartan patterns are often designed using specific principles, including:\n\n* **Balance**: Tartan patterns are designed to be balanced and symmetrical.\n* **Harmony**: Tartan patterns are designed to be harmonious and visually appealing.\n* **Contrast**: Tartan patterns often feature contrasting colors and patterns to create visual interest.\n\n### Colour, Palettes, and Meaning\n\nTartan patterns can feature a wide range of colors, including:\n\n* **Earth tones**: These are muted colors such as brown, beige, and green.\n* **Bright colors**: These are bold, bright colors such as red, blue, and yellow.\n* **Metallic colors**: These are shiny, metallic colors such as silver and gold.\n\nThe colors used in a tartan pattern can have specific meanings, including:\n\n* **Clan colors**: Each Scottish clan has its own unique tartan pattern, which is often associated with the clan's colors.\n* **Family colors**: Tartan patterns can be used to represent family colors or heritage.\n* **National colors**: Tartan patterns can be used to represent national colors or pride.\n\n**Early History**\n\n### Pre-Medieval Origins\n\nThe origins of tartan patterns are unclear, but it is believed that they date back to pre-medieval times. The earliest known tartan patterns were found in ancient Egyptian and Greek textiles.\n\n### Medieval\n\nDuring the medieval period, tartan patterns were used extensively in Scotland and other parts of Europe. They were often used to create elaborate and intricate designs, including coats of arms and other heraldic devices.\n\n### 16th Century\n\nIn the 16th century, tartan patterns became more widespread in Scotland, particularly among the nobility and gentry. They were often used to create elaborate and ornate designs, including tartan kilts and other textiles.\n\n### 17th Century\n\nDuring the 17th century, tartan patterns became more standardized in Scotland, with specific patterns being associated with particular clans and families.\n\n### 18th Century\n\nIn the 18th century, tartan patterns became more widespread in Scotland, particularly among the population. They were often used to create practical and functional textiles, including kilts and other clothing.\n\n### Union Protest and Jacobite Rebellion\n\nIn the 18th century, tartan patterns became associated with the Scottish Jacobite rebellion, which sought to restore the Stuart dynasty to the British throne. Tartan patterns were seen as a symbol of Scottish culture and identity, and were often used to express opposition to the British government.\n\n### Proscription and its Aftermath\n\nIn the 18th century, the British government imposed a ban on the wearing of tartan patterns, known as the \"Act of Proscription.\" This ban was intended to suppress Scottish culture and identity, but it ultimately had the opposite effect, with tartan patterns becoming even more popular and widespread.\n\n**Regimental Tartans**\n\nRegimental tartans are specific tartan patterns associated with particular military regiments. They are often used to create ceremonial uniforms and other textiles.\n\n### Long-Running Debate\n\nThere is a long-running debate among historians and tartan enthusiasts about the origins and meaning of regimental tartans. Some argue that they date back to medieval times, while others believe they were created in the 18th century.\n\n### Earliest Evidence\n\nThe earliest known evidence of regimental tartans dates back to the 18th century, when they were used by Scottish regiments in the British army.\n\n### Lack of Further Evidence of Early Adoption\n\nDespite the debate, there is a lack of further evidence to support the idea that regimental tartans were used in medieval times.\n\n### 19th Century Broad Adoption\n\nIn the 19th century, regimental tartans became more widespread in the British army, with many regiments adopting their own unique patterns.\n\n### 20th Century Consolidation\n\nIn the 20th century, regimental tartans became even more standardized, with specific patterns being associated with particular regiments.\n\n### Recognition by Clan Chiefs\n\nIn recent years, some regimental tartans have been recognized by clan chiefs, who have declared them to be part of their clan's heritage.\n\n**Modern General Use**\n\n### Late Georgian\n\nIn the late Georgian period, tartan patterns became more widespread in Scotland, particularly among the population. They were often used to create practical and functional textiles, including kilts and other clothing.\n\n### The King's Jaunt in Tartan\n\nIn the 19th century, the British monarch, King George IV, wore tartan patterns as part of his royal regalia. This helped to popularize tartan patterns among the British aristocracy.\n\n### Civilian Spread\n\nIn the 19th century, tartan patterns became more widespread among the civilian population, particularly in Scotland and other parts of the UK.\n\n**Victorian**\n\n### Vestiarium Scoticum\n\nIn the 19th century, the Vestiarium Scoticum, a book of Scottish textiles, was published. This helped to promote tartan patterns and other Scottish textiles.\n\n### The Queen and \"Balmorality\"\n\nIn the 19th century, Queen Victoria became interested in Scottish culture and tartan patterns. She wore tartan patterns as part of her royal regalia, and helped to popularize them among the British aristocracy.\n\n### Ripple Effects\n\nThe popularity of tartan patterns in the 19th century had a ripple effect, with many other countries and cultures adopting similar patterns and designs.\n\n**20th Century to Present**\n\n### Diaspora and Globalisation\n\nIn the 20th century, tartan patterns became more widespread around the world, particularly in countries with Scottish diaspora communities.\n\n### Industry and Politics\n\nIn the 20th century, the tartan industry became more commercialized, with many companies producing tartan patterns and textiles.\n\n### In Popular Culture\n\nTartan patterns have been used in popular culture, including in film, literature, and music.\n\n**Popular Designs**\n\nSome popular tartan designs include:\n\n* **Black Watch tartan**: A dark, muted tartan pattern associated with the Black Watch regiment.\n* **Royal Stewart tartan**: A bright, bold tartan pattern associated with the Royal Stewart clan.\n* **Gordon tartan**: A classic, muted tartan pattern associated with the Gordon clan.\n\n**Tartans for Specific Purposes**\n\nTartan patterns can be used for a variety of purposes, including:\n\n* **Regional**: Tartan patterns can be used to represent specific regions or countries.\n* **Hunting, mourning, dress, and dance**: Tartan patterns can be used to create clothing and textiles for specific occasions.\n* **Family and individual**: Tartan patterns can be used to represent family or individual heritage.\n* **Corporate and commercial**: Tartan patterns can be used to create branding and marketing materials.\n\n### Fashion\n\nTartan patterns have been used in fashion, including in clothing, textiles, and accessories.\n\n**Regulation**\n\n### Registration\n\nTartan patterns can be registered with the Scottish Tartans Authority, which helps to protect their intellectual property.\n\n### Legal Protection\n\nTartan patterns are protected by intellectual property laws, which help to prevent unauthorized use.\n\n### Etiquette\n\nThere are specific rules and etiquette surrounding the use of tartan patterns, including the proper way to wear tartan clothing and the correct use of tartan designs.\n\n**In Other Cultures**\n\nTartan patterns have been adopted by other cultures, including:\n\n* **Africa**: The Maasai people of East Africa use tartan patterns in their traditional clothing and textiles.\n* **East and South Asia**: Tartan patterns have been used in textiles and clothing in countries such as Bhutan, India, and Japan.\n* **Eastern Europe to Western Asia**: Tartan patterns have been used in textiles and clothing in countries such as Russia and Kazakhstan.\n* **Oceania**: The Māori people of New Zealand have adopted tartan patterns in their traditional clothing and textiles.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* **Patterns**: Tartan patterns can be categorized into different types of patterns, including geometric patterns, nature-inspired patterns, and abstract patterns.\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is a comprehensive overview of tartan patterns and their history, meaning, and cultural significance.\n* Tartan patterns have been used in a variety of contexts, including fashion, textiles, and cultural heritage.\n* The article includes information on the history of tartan patterns, their cultural significance, and their use in different contexts.\n\n**References**\n\n* This article does not include specific citations or references.

He is a leading figure in the French New Wave movement, known for his innovative and influential films that challenge conventional narrative structures and push the boundaries of cinematic storytelling.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nBorn in Paris, France, on December 3, 1930, Godard grew up in a middle-class family. His father, Paul Godard, was a surgeon, and his mother, Nadia, was a socialite. Godard's early life was marked by a passion for cinema, and he began writing film reviews for a local newspaper at the age of 15. He attended the Sorbonne University in Paris, where he studied philosophy and literature.\n\n**Early Career (1950–1959)**\n\nGodard's early career as a film critic was marked by his involvement with the influential film magazine _Cahiers du Cinéma_. In 1950, he began writing reviews for the magazine, alongside other future New Wave directors such as François Truffaut and Éric Rohmer. His criticism was known for its bold and innovative style, which challenged traditional film criticism and pushed the boundaries of cinematic storytelling.\n\n### Film Criticism\n\nGodard's film criticism was characterized by its emphasis on the auteur theory, which posits that a film's director is the primary author of the film. He argued that the director's vision and style are essential to the film's meaning and significance. This theory would later become a central tenet of the French New Wave movement.\n\n### Filmmaking\n\nGodard's first foray into filmmaking was as a screenwriter and editor for the French television network _RTF_. In 1956, he made his debut as a film director with the short film _Operation Beton_. However, it was not until the release of his 1960 film _Breathless_ that Godard gained widespread recognition as a film director.\n\n**New Wave Period (1960–1967)**\n\nThe New Wave period was marked by Godard's innovative and influential films, which challenged conventional narrative structures and pushed the boundaries of cinematic storytelling. His films during this period are characterized by their use of location shooting, handheld camera work, and improvisational acting techniques.\n\n### Breathless\n\nGodard's 1960 film _Breathless_ is a groundbreaking work that marked the beginning of the French New Wave movement. The film's innovative use of location shooting, handheld camera work, and improvisational acting techniques helped to create a new style of filmmaking that would influence generations of filmmakers.\n\n### Early Work with Anna Karina\n\nGodard's collaboration with actress Anna Karina began with the 1960 film _Breathless_ and continued throughout the 1960s. Their partnership resulted in some of Godard's most innovative and influential films, including _Vivre sa vie_ and _Contempt_.\n\n### Vivre sa vie\n\nGodard's 1962 film _Vivre sa vie_ is a masterpiece of French New Wave cinema. The film's use of location shooting, handheld camera work, and improvisational acting techniques creates a sense of realism and immediacy that is unmatched in other films of the period.\n\n### Le petit soldat and Les Carabiniers\n\nGodard's 1960 film _Le petit soldat_ is a critically acclaimed work that explores the themes of war and politics. The film's use of location shooting and handheld camera work creates a sense of realism and immediacy that is unmatched in other films of the period.\n\n### Contempt\n\nGodard's 1963 film _Contempt_ is a masterpiece of French New Wave cinema. The film's use of location shooting, handheld camera work, and improvisational acting techniques creates a sense of realism and immediacy that is unmatched in other films of the period.\n\n### Anouchka Films\n\nGodard's 1964 film _Anouchka_ was a critical and commercial success. The film's use of location shooting and handheld camera work creates a sense of realism and immediacy that is unmatched in other films of the period.\n\n### Week End\n\nGodard's 1967 film _Week End_ is a critically acclaimed work that explores the themes of politics and revolution. The film's use of location shooting and handheld camera work creates a sense of realism and immediacy that is unmatched in other films of the period.\n\n**Political Period (1968–1979)**\n\nThe political period was marked by Godard's increasing involvement with revolutionary politics and his critique of capitalism and imperialism. His films during this period are characterized by their use of location shooting, handheld camera work, and improvisational acting techniques.\n\n### Vietnam War\n\nGodard's 1968 film _One Plus One_ is a critically acclaimed work that explores the themes of politics and revolution.

This phenomenon occurred in many parts of the world, including Western and Eastern Europe, as well as beyond Europe.\n\nTerminology\n\nThe term \"collaboration\" has been used to describe the various forms of cooperation and assistance provided by governments, organizations, and individuals to the Axis powers during World War II. This includes not only military collaboration, but also economic, administrative, and social cooperation. The term \"collaboration\" can be used to describe both voluntary and coerced cooperation, as well as cooperation that was official and informal.\n\nCollaboration in Western Europe\n\nBelgium\n\nBelgium was occupied by German forces in May 1940, and the government in exile was established in London. However, a number of Belgians collaborated with the Nazis, including the Rex movement, which was a fascist organization that sought to create a fascist state in Belgium. The Rex movement was led by Leon Degrelle, who became a close associate of Hitler and was awarded the Iron Cross for his services to the Nazi regime.\n\nBritish Channel Islands\n\nThe British Channel Islands, which include Jersey and Guernsey, were occupied by German forces in 1940. A number of islanders collaborated with the Nazis, including some who served in the German military. Others collaborated by providing intelligence and other forms of assistance to the German occupation authorities.\n\nDenmark\n\nDenmark was occupied by German forces in April 1940, and the Danish government was forced to cooperate with the Nazis. However, a number of Danes resisted the occupation, and many others collaborated with the Nazis in various ways, including serving in the German military or providing intelligence and other forms of assistance.\n\nFrance\n\nVichy France\n\nVichy France was a fascist regime that was established in France in 1940, after the French government was forced to surrender to Germany. The Vichy regime was led by Marshal Philippe Pétain, who became a close associate of Hitler and was awarded the Grand Cross of the German Order. The Vichy regime collaborated closely with the Nazis, providing them with military, economic, and administrative support.\n\nCollaborationist movements\n\nA number of collaborationist movements emerged in France during World War II, including the Milice française, which was a fascist organization that was established in 1943. The Milice française was led by Joseph Darnand, who became a close associate of Hitler and was awarded the Grand Cross of the German Order.\n\nUniformed collaboration\n\nA number of Frenchmen served in the German military during World War II, including in the Waffen-SS. Many of these men were motivated by a desire to fight against communism, and some were also motivated by a desire to fight against the Soviet Union.\n\nCommunist party\n\nThe Communist Party of France collaborated with the Nazis during World War II, although this collaboration was not as extensive as that of some other French parties. The Communist Party saw the Nazis as a bulwark against fascism and communism, and many of its members served in the French Resistance.\n\nFrench workers for Germany\n\nA number of French workers were sent to Germany to work in the Nazi war effort, including in the munitions industry and in agriculture. These workers were forced to work under the supervision of the Nazis, and many were subjected to harsh conditions and mistreatment.\n\nVichy collaboration in the Holocaust\n\nThe Vichy regime collaborated closely with the Nazis in the Holocaust, providing them with administrative and logistical support.

The phenomenon began with a series of sightings in the Pacific Northwest and gradually spread throughout the country, captivating the public's attention and sparking intense media coverage.\n\n**Overview**\n\nThe 1947 flying disc craze was a significant event in popular culture, marking one of the first major waves of UFO sightings in the United States. The phenomenon was characterized by reports of disc-shaped objects seen flying through the sky, often at high speeds and with unusual maneuvers. The sightings sparked a mix of fascination, fear, and skepticism, with some people claiming to have seen the objects up close, while others dismissed them as hoaxes or misidentifications of natural phenomena.\n\n**Events of Summer 1947**\n\n### Initial Reports\n\nThe first reported sighting of a flying disc occurred on June 24, 1947, by private pilot Kenneth Arnold, who claimed to have seen nine disc-shaped objects flying in formation over Mount Rainier, Washington. Arnold's sighting sparked a wave of reports from other eyewitnesses in the Pacific Northwest, with many describing similar objects seen flying through the sky.\n\n### Additional Reports\n\nAs the summer of 1947 progressed, reports of flying discs continued to pour in from across the country. On June 28, a group of people in Fargo, North Dakota, reported seeing a disc-shaped object flying over the city. On July 2, a farmer in Iowa claimed to have seen a flying disc land in a nearby field. These reports, along with many others, contributed to the growing sense of excitement and mystery surrounding the phenomenon.\n\n### Pacific Northwest Reports Amid Jet Speculation\n\nThe Pacific Northwest remained a hotspot for flying disc sightings, with many reports coming from the states of Washington and Oregon. Some witnesses claimed to have seen flying discs performing unusual maneuvers, such as making sharp turns and disappearing into thin air. The reports sparked speculation about the possibility of jet-powered aircraft being used to create the sightings, but many experts dismissed this theory, citing the lack of evidence and the unusual characteristics of the reported objects.\n\n### Reports Throughout the West\n\nAs the summer of 1947 wore on, flying disc sightings began to spread throughout the Western United States. Reports came in from California, Arizona, and Nevada, with many witnesses describing similar disc-shaped objects seen flying through the sky.

The sighting sparked a media frenzy, with many newspapers and magazines publishing stories about the incident.\n\n### Group Sightings\n\nAs the summer of 1947 progressed, reports of group sightings became more common. Many people claimed to have seen flying discs flying in formation, often at high speeds and with unusual maneuvers. The sightings sparked a mix of fascination and fear, with many people unsure of what to make of the events.\n\n### Atomic Link Claimed\n\nSome witnesses claimed to have seen flying discs performing unusual maneuvers, such as making sharp turns and disappearing into thin air. The sightings sparked speculation about the possibility of atomic-powered aircraft being used to create the sightings, but many experts dismissed this theory, citing the lack of evidence and the unusual characteristics of the reported objects.\n\n### Reports Peak\n\nThe number of flying disc sightings peaked in mid-July 1947, with reports coming in from all over the country. The sightings sparked a media frenzy, with many newspapers and magazines publishing stories about the phenomenon.\n\n**Weather Balloons, Pranks, and Hoaxes**\n\n### Roswell Debris\n\nOn July 8, 1947, a group of people in Roswell, New Mexico, reported finding debris from a flying disc that had crashed into a nearby field.

The day is also a call to action for accelerating gender parity and promoting women's rights and empowerment.\n\n# History\n\n## Origins\n\nThe idea of celebrating a day for women's rights dates back to the early 20th century. The first known observation of a Women's Day was on February 28, 1909, when 15,000 women marched through New York City's streets to protest against working conditions and demand better pay, shorter hours, and voting rights. The following year, on March 8, 1910, the second International Conference of Socialist Women was held in Copenhagen, Denmark, where the concept of an International Women's Day was officially proposed.\n\n## The Russian Revolution and Communist countries\n\nThe Russian Revolution in 1917 marked a significant turning point in the history of International Women's Day. Following the revolution, the Bolsheviks declared that March 8 would be a day of celebration for working women. The Soviet Union continued to observe this day, and it became a key event in the socialist calendar. In the years that followed, other Communist countries, such as Poland, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia, also adopted March 8 as International Women's Day.\n\n## Other countries, 1920s to 1960s\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, International Women's Day gained popularity in other parts of the world, particularly in Europe and the Americas. In the United States, for example, the day was observed in cities like New York, Chicago, and San Francisco, with demonstrations, rallies, and marches. In the UK, the day was marked with rallies and speeches in London and other major cities. In Australia, women in Sydney and Melbourne took to the streets to demand equal pay and voting rights.\n\n## Second–wave feminism\n\nThe second wave of feminism in the 1960s and 1970s saw a renewed focus on International Women's Day. Women's liberation movements around the world used the day to organize protests, demonstrations, and rallies, demanding equal rights, reproductive rights, and an end to sexism and violence against women.\n\n## Adoption by United Nations\n\nIn 1975, the United Nations celebrated International Women's Day for the first time, marking a significant milestone in the global recognition of the day. In 1977, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution calling for the observance of International Women's Day on March 8. Since then, the UN has continued to observe the day, with a focus on promoting women's rights and empowerment.\n\n## Adoption by corporations\n\nIn recent years, International Women's Day has gained popularity among corporations and businesses. Companies around the world now observe the day by hosting events, releasing statements, and launching campaigns to promote women's empowerment and gender equality.\n\n# International Women's Day by year\n\n## 1995\n\nInternational Women's Day in 1995 was marked by protests and demonstrations around the world, particularly in the context of the Beijing Platform for Action, a UN conference held in China that year. The conference aimed to address women's rights and empowerment, but the event was marred by controversy and human rights abuses.\n\n## 1996\n\nIn 1996, International Women's Day saw a renewed focus on women's economic empowerment, with protests and rallies held in cities around the world to demand equal pay and better working conditions.\n\n## 2003\n\nIn 2003, International Women's Day was marked by a global campaign to end violence against women, with demonstrations and rallies held in cities around the world.\n\n## 2006\n\nIn 2006, International Women's Day saw a focus on women's health and reproductive rights, with protests and rallies held in cities around the world to demand access to safe and affordable abortion.\n\n## 2008\n\nIn 2008, International Women's Day was marked by a global economic crisis, with women around the world affected by poverty, unemployment, and economic insecurity.\n\n## 2009\n\nIn 2009, International Women's Day saw a renewed focus on women's leadership and empowerment, with protests and rallies held in cities around the world to promote women's participation in politics and decision-making.\n\n## 2010\n\nIn 2010, International Women's Day was marked by a global campaign to end violence against women, with demonstrations and rallies held in cities around the world.\n\n## 2011\n\nIn 2011, International Women's Day saw a focus on women's economic empowerment, with protests and rallies held in cities around the world to demand equal pay and better working conditions.\n\n## 2012\n\nIn 2012, International Women's Day was marked by a global campaign to end child marriage, with demonstrations and rallies held in cities around the world.\n\n## 2013\n\nIn 2013, International Women's Day saw a renewed focus on women's health and reproductive rights, with protests and rallies held in cities around the world to demand access to safe and affordable abortion.\n\n## 2014\n\nIn 2014, International Women's Day was marked by a global campaign to end violence against women, with demonstrations and rallies held in cities around the world.\n\n## 2015\n\nIn 2015, International Women's Day saw a focus on women's leadership and empowerment, with protests and rallies held in cities around the world to promote women's participation in politics and decision-making.\n\n## 2016\n\nIn 2016, International Women's Day was marked by a global campaign to end sexism and misogyny, with demonstrations and rallies held in cities around the world.\n\n## 2017\n\nIn 2017, International Women's Day saw a renewed focus on women's economic empowerment, with protests and rallies held in cities around the world to demand equal pay and better working conditions.\n\n## 2018\n\nIn 2018, International Women's Day was marked by a global campaign to end violence against women, with demonstrations and rallies held in cities around the world.\n\n## 2019\n\nIn 2019, International Women's Day saw a focus on women's health and reproductive rights, with protests and rallies held in cities around the world to demand access to safe and affordable abortion.\n\n## 2020\n\nIn 2020, International Women's Day was marked by a global pandemic, with women around the world affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n## 2021\n\nIn 2021, International Women's Day saw a renewed focus on women's leadership and empowerment, with protests and rallies held in cities around the world to promote women's participation in politics and decision-making.\n\n## 2022\n\nIn 2022, International Women's Day was marked by a global campaign to end violence against women, with demonstrations and rallies held in cities around the world.\n\n## 2023\n\nIn 2023, International Women's Day saw a focus on women's economic empowerment, with protests and rallies held in cities around the world to demand equal pay and better working conditions.\n\n## 2024\n\nIn 2024, International Women's Day will likely be marked by a global celebration of women's rights and empowerment, with demonstrations and rallies held in cities around the world.\n\n# Around the world\n\nInternational Women's Day is celebrated in many countries around the world, with unique traditions and customs.

It began as a response to perceived corruption and abuse in the Roman Catholic Church and led to the emergence of Protestantism.\n\nTerminology\n------------\n\nThe term \"Reformation\" comes from the Latin \"reformatio,\" meaning \"renewal\" or \"reformation.\" It was used by Martin Luther to describe his efforts to reform the Catholic Church. The term \"Protestant\" was first used in 1529 to describe the followers of Luther, who protested against the Catholic Church's actions at the Diet of Speyer.\n\nBackground\n----------\n\n### Calamities\n\nThe 15th century was marked by several calamities that weakened the Catholic Church and created an environment in which reform movements could take root. The Black Death, which killed an estimated 75 to 200 million people, led to social, economic, and cultural upheaval. The Hundred Years' War between England and France also created instability and economic hardship.\n\n### Late Medieval Christianity\n\nThe Catholic Church in the late Middle Ages was a complex institution with both spiritual and temporal powers. It was led by the Pope, who was considered the spiritual leader of Christendom. The Church had a hierarchical structure, with the Pope at the top and the clergy below him.\n\n#### Institutions\n\nThe Catholic Church had a vast network of institutions, including monasteries, convents, and bishoprics. These institutions were responsible for providing education, healthcare, and charity to the faithful. They also played a key role in promoting the Catholic faith and enforcing Church doctrine.\n\n#### Clergy\n\nThe clergy was divided into several orders, including bishops, priests, and monks. Bishops were responsible for overseeing the spiritual affairs of their dioceses, while priests performed sacraments and provided spiritual guidance to their flock. Monks and nuns lived in monasteries and convents, where they devoted themselves to prayer, study, and manual labor.\n\n#### Papacy\n\nThe Papacy was the highest authority in the Catholic Church. The Pope was considered the successor of St. Peter and the spiritual leader of Christendom. He had the power to appoint bishops, grant indulgences, and interpret Church doctrine.\n\n#### Partial and failed institutional reforms\n\nIn the 14th and 15th centuries, the Catholic Church attempted to reform itself through various councils and synods. The Council of Constance (1414-1418) and the Council of Basel (1431-1449) were two such attempts. However, these efforts were largely unsuccessful, and the Church remained corrupt and hierarchical.\n\n### Humanism and lay religion\n\nHumanism was a cultural and intellectual movement that emerged in Italy in the 14th century. It emphasized the study of classical texts, the pursuit of knowledge, and the development of individual talent. Humanism influenced the emergence of lay religion, where ordinary people began to take a more active role in their spiritual lives.\n\n### Dissidents\n\nDissidents were individuals who challenged the authority of the Catholic Church.

He rejected the Catholic Church's doctrine of sacraments and the authority of the Pope. Luther's theology was a major departure from traditional Catholic teaching and paved the way for Protestantism.\n\n### Spread\n\nLuther's ideas quickly spread throughout Germany and Europe. His followers, known as Lutherans, began to organize themselves into churches and communities. The Lutheran Reformation was a major event in European history, marking a significant break with the Catholic Church.\n\n### Resistance and oppression\n\nHowever, the Lutheran Reformation was not without opposition.

The Samnites were known for their fierce warrior culture, their complex society, and their significant contributions to the development of the Roman Republic.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe name \"Samnite\" is derived from the ancient Greek term \"Σαμνιοί\" (Samnion), which was used to refer to the inhabitants of the region. The name is thought to be connected to the Samnite language, which was a member of the Sabellian branch of the Italic languages.\n\n**History**\n\n### Origins and Early History\n\nThe origins of the Samnites are shrouded in mystery, but it is believed that they were one of the earliest Italic peoples to inhabit the region of Samnium. The Samnites were likely descended from the Proto-Italic peoples who migrated to Italy from the Balkans during the Neolithic period. Archaeological evidence suggests that the Samnites were a pastoral people who lived in a society based on agriculture and animal husbandry.\n\n### Samnite Wars\n\nThe Samnites were known for their fierce resistance to the expansion of the Roman Republic. The Samnite Wars were a series of conflicts that took place from the 4th to the 3rd century BCE, during which the Samnites fought against the Romans for control of the Italian peninsula. The wars were marked by a series of significant battles, including the Battle of Caudium in 321 BCE, the Battle of Tifernum in 295 BCE, and the Battle of Beneventum in 275 BCE. Although the Samnites were ultimately defeated, they were able to establish a degree of autonomy and maintain their cultural identity.\n\n### Later History\n\nAfter the Samnite Wars, the Samnites continued to live in the region of Samnium, which became a Roman province in the 1st century BCE. The Samnites were able to maintain their cultural identity and continued to contribute to the development of the Roman Empire. During the Roman Empire period, the Samnites were known for their skill in engineering and architecture, and many of their cities and buildings were constructed during this period.\n\n**Society**\n\n### Economy\n\nThe Samnites were a pastoral people who lived in a society based on agriculture and animal husbandry. They were skilled in the production of cheese, wine, and wool, and their economy was based on the export of these products. The Samnites were also known for their skill in metalworking, particularly in the production of iron and bronze.\n\n### Government\n\nThe Samnite government was a complex system of councils and magistrates, which was influenced by the Etruscan and Roman systems of government. The Samnites had a system of elective magistrates, including consuls and praetors, who were responsible for the administration of justice and the conduct of foreign policy.\n\n### Military\n\nThe Samnite military was known for its discipline and ferocity, and was composed of heavily armed infantrymen who were equipped with the falcata, a curved sword, and the pilum, a javelin. The Samnites were also skilled in the use of siege engines and were able to construct elaborate fortifications.\n\n#### Armor\n\nThe Samnites were known for their use of distinctive armor, which included the manica, a sleeve-like armor that protected the arm, and the corselet, a breastplate that protected the torso.\n\n#### Weaponry\n\nThe Samnites were known for their use of the falcata, a curved sword that was used for both cutting and slashing. They were also skilled in the use of the pilum, a javelin that was used for throwing. The Samnites were also known for their use of the sagittae, a type of short sword that was used for close combat.\n\n**Culture**\n\n### Religion\n\nThe Samnites were a polytheistic people who worshipped a pantheon of gods and goddesses, including Jupiter, Mars, and Diana. They were also known for their worship of the goddess Cybele, who was associated with fertility and protection.\n\n### Gender Roles\n\nThe Samnites had a complex system of gender roles, which was influenced by the Etruscan and Roman systems of social organization. Women played an important role in Samnite society, and were often involved in the production of textiles and other domestic activities.\n\n### Art\n\nThe Samnites were known for their skill in metalworking, particularly in the production of bronze and iron. They were also skilled in the production of ceramics and other decorative arts.\n\n### Clothing\n\nThe Samnites wore a distinctive type of clothing, which included the sagum, a woolen cloak that was worn over the shoulders, and the tunic, a loose-fitting garment that was worn over the body.\n\n### Recreation\n\nThe Samnites were known for their love of sports and games, and were particularly skilled in the art of wrestling. They were also known for their love of music and dance, and were often accompanied by the sound of the aulos, a type of double reed instrument.\n\n### Cities and Engineering\n\nThe Samnites were skilled in the construction of cities and buildings, and were known for their use of arches and vaults in the construction of their cities. They were also skilled in the use of aqueducts and other engineering projects.\n\n**Notable Samnites**\n\n### Leaders of the Samnites\n\nThe Samnites were led by a number of notable leaders, including the dictator Decius Mus, who was known for his bravery and military skill. They were also led by the general Papirius Cursor, who was known for his cunning and strategic ability.\n\n### Social War Leaders\n\nThe Samnites were also led by a number of leaders during the Social War, including the general Tiberius Gracchus, who was known for his attempts to reform the Roman constitution.

The search was part of a broader investigation into the handling and storage of presidential records by Trump, including classified material.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe handling, storage, and disposition of U.S. government records are governed by a complex array of laws, regulations, and guidelines. The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) is responsible for overseeing the management of presidential records, including those created during a president's term in office.\n\n**Handling, storage, and disposition of U.S. government records**\n\nThe Federal Records Act of 1950 requires federal agencies to maintain accurate and complete records of their activities, and to transfer these records to NARA at the end of the agency's useful life. Presidential records are considered federal records and are subject to these requirements.\n\n**Criminal laws listed on search warrant**\n\nThe search warrant issued in this case listed several federal statutes, including:\n\n* 18 U.S.C. § 793(e): Gathering, transmitting or losing defense information\n* 18 U.S.C. § 793(f): Wrongful removal or retention of national defense information\n* 18 U.S.C. § 2071: Concealment, removal, or mutilation generally\n\n**Classified material and the presidency**\n\nClassified material is information that has been classified as sensitive or confidential by the government. As president, Trump had access to classified information, and was responsible for ensuring that it was handled and stored properly.\n\n**Declassification, presidential powers and regulations**\n\nThe president has the power to declassify classified information, but this power is not absolute. The president must follow established procedures and guidelines for declassification, and must also consider the potential consequences of declassification.\n\n**Protocols for loss or compromise of classified material**\n\nIn the event of a loss or compromise of classified material, the government has established protocols for responding to the incident. These protocols include containment, investigation, and mitigation of damage.\n\n**Events leading to the search**\n\nThe search of Mar-a-Lago was the culmination of a series of events and actions by NARA, the FBI, and Trump.\n\n**NARA actions to retrieve presidential records from Mar-a-Lago**\n\nIn January 2022, NARA requested that Trump return presidential records to the agency. Trump initially refused, claiming that he had declassified the records.\n\n**Partial return of records to NARA**\n\nIn February 2022, Trump returned a portion of the presidential records to NARA, but the agency claimed that these records were still not fully complete.\n\n**Trump's statement regarding return of records**\n\nTrump claimed that he had returned all the records that were requested by NARA.\n\n**NARA makes criminal referral**\n\nIn May 2022, NARA referred the matter to the FBI for investigation, claiming that Trump had violated federal laws and regulations.\n\n**Tom Fitton's advice to Trump**\n\nTom Fitton, the president of Judicial Watch, a conservative advocacy group, advised Trump to release all the records to NARA, rather than returning them.\n\n**FBI/DOJ launches criminal investigation and issues subpoenas**\n\nIn June 2022, the FBI launched a criminal investigation into the handling and storage of presidential records by Trump. The agency issued subpoenas to Trump and his associates.\n\n**May 2022 subpoena**\n\nThe first subpoena was issued in May 2022, requesting that Trump turn over specific documents and records.\n\n**June 2022 subpoena**\n\nA second subpoena was issued in June 2022, requesting additional documents and records.\n\n**FBI/DOJ obtains search warrant from federal court**\n\nOn August 5, 2022, a federal court issued a search warrant for Mar-a-Lago, allowing the FBI to search the property for evidence of a crime.\n\n**Search of Mar-a-Lago**\n\nThe search of Mar-a-Lago was conducted on August 8, 2022, and lasted several hours. The FBI seized a large number of documents and records, including classified material.\n\n**Search of other Trump properties**\n\nThe FBI also searched other Trump properties, including his home in Palm Beach and his club in Bedminster, New Jersey.\n\n**Release of search warrant, property receipt, and affidavit**\n\nOn August 11, 2022, the FBI released the search warrant, property receipt, and affidavit related to the search of Mar-a-Lago.\n\n**Release of search warrant and property receipt**\n\nThe search warrant and property receipt listed the specific items that were seized during the search.\n\n**Seized materials**\n\nThe FBI seized a large number of documents and records, including classified material, personal items, and other evidence.\n\n**Missing materials**\n\nSome materials were missing from the property, including a folder marked \"top secret\".\n\n**Motions to release search warrant affidavit**\n\nTrump's lawyers filed a motion to release the search warrant affidavit, but the court denied the motion.\n\n**Release of redacted search warrant affidavit**\n\nOn August 19, 2022, the court released a redacted version of the search warrant affidavit.\n\n**Release of detailed property list**\n\nOn August 22, 2022, the court released a detailed property list, listing the specific items that were seized during the search.\n\n**Trump v. United States**\n\nTrump filed a lawsuit against the United States, claiming that the search was unlawful and that the FBI had planted evidence.\n\n**Special counsel investigation**\n\nThe special counsel investigation into the handling and storage of presidential records by Trump is ongoing.\n\n**Indictment**\n\nThe special counsel has not yet issued an indictment in the case.\n\n**Reactions**\n\nThe search of Mar-a-Lago has generated a wide range of reactions from politicians, scholars, and the public.\n\n**Congress**\n\nCongressional Democrats have praised the search, claiming that it was necessary to ensure that presidential records are handled properly.\n\n**White House**\n\nThe White House has declined to comment on the search.\n\n**National Archives**\n\nThe National Archives has praised the search, claiming that it was necessary to ensure that presidential records are handled properly.\n\n**Trump, his family, and his attorneys**\n\nTrump has claimed that the search was a \"witch hunt\" and that the FBI had planted evidence.\n\n**Claims of political motivation, planted evidence, and Obama precedent**\n\nTrump's lawyers have claimed that the search was motivated by politics and that the FBI had planted evidence.\n\n**Claims of declassifying all documents**\n\nTrump has claimed that he declassified all the documents that were seized during the search.\n\n**Lawsuit**\n\nTrump has filed a lawsuit against the United States, claiming that the search was unlawful and that the FBI had planted evidence.\n\n**Trump allies and supporters**\n\nTrump's allies and supporters have praised the search, claiming that it was necessary to ensure that presidential records are handled properly.\n\n**Threats against government officials**\n\nSome Trump supporters have made threats against government officials involved in the search.\n\n**FBI field office attack**\n\nThe FBI field office in Cincinnati, Ohio, was attacked by a gunman in August 2022.\n\n**Republican elected officials and candidates**\n\nSome Republican elected officials and candidates have criticized the search, claiming that it was an overreach of executive power.\n\n**Congressional Democrats**\n\nCongressional Democrats have praised the search, claiming that it was necessary to ensure that presidential records are handled properly.\n\n**Scholars and former officials**\n\nScholars and former officials have praised the search, claiming that it was necessary to ensure that presidential records are handled properly.\n\n**Intelligence community**\n\nThe intelligence community has praised the search, claiming that it was necessary to ensure that presidential records are handled properly.\n\n**Former Trump administration figures**\n\nSome former Trump administration figures have praised the search, claiming that it was necessary to ensure that presidential records are handled properly.\n\n**Notes**\n\nThe search of Mar-a-Lago is a significant event in the history of the presidency, and it has raised important questions about the handling and storage of presidential records.\n\n**See also**\n\n* List of presidential records scandals\n* Presidential Records Act of 1974\n* National Archives and Records Administration\n* Federal Bureau of Investigation\n* Department of Justice\n\n**References**\n\n* Federal Records Act of 1950\n* Presidential Records Act of 1974\n* National Archives and Records Administration\n* Federal Bureau of Investigation\n* Department of Justice\n\n**External links**\n\n* Search of Mar-a-Lago on Wikipedia\n* Federal Bureau of Investigation\n* Department of Justice\n* National Archives and Records Administration", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The fort played a significant role in the history of New York City, serving as a military outpost, administrative center, and trading hub. This article provides an overview of the fort's establishment, various periods of rule, and its impact on the region.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n### Establishment (1621–1660)\n\nThe Dutch West India Company (WIC) founded Fort Amsterdam in 1621 on the southern tip of Manhattan Island, which was then inhabited by Lenape Native Americans. The fort was built to serve as a military outpost and trading post, and its strategic location allowed the Dutch to control access to the Hudson River and the surrounding area. The fort's early years were marked by conflicts with the Lenape and English colonists.\n\nDuring this period, the fort was used as a base for Dutch explorers and traders, who sought to establish trade relationships with the Native Americans and expand Dutch influence in the region. The fort's commander, Peter Minuit, played a significant role in the development of the Dutch colonial presence in New York.\n\n### English rule (1664–1673)\n\nIn 1664, the English took control of New Amsterdam, including Fort Amsterdam, from the Dutch. The English renamed the fort New York and used it as a military outpost and administrative center. The English period was marked by conflicts with the Lenape and tensions with the Dutch, who continued to exert influence in the region.\n\nDuring this time, the fort was used as a base for English military operations against the Dutch and the French, who were also vying for control of the region. The English also established a trading post at the fort, which became a hub for the export of furs and other natural resources.\n\n### Dutch rule (1673–1674)\n\nIn 1673, the Dutch recaptured New York and Fort Amsterdam from the English, but their control was short-lived. The English regained the fort in 1674, and the Dutch were forced to cede control of the colony.\n\n### English rule (1674–1689)\n\nThe English period that followed was marked by continued tensions with the Lenape and the Dutch, as well as conflicts with French colonists. The fort was used as a base for English military operations against the French and their Native American allies.\n\nDuring this time, the fort was also used as a site for the administration of the colony, with the English governor and other officials residing within its walls. The English also established a number of trade relationships with the Lenape and other Native American tribes, which helped to solidify English influence in the region.\n\n### Colonist rule (1689–1691)\n\nIn 1689, a group of English colonists, led by Governor Thomas Dongan, seized control of the fort and the colony from the English government. This period was marked by tensions with the Lenape and the French, as well as conflicts with British authorities.\n\nDuring this time, the fort was used as a base for the colonists' military operations against the French and their Native American allies. The colonists also established a number of trade relationships with the Lenape and other Native American tribes, which helped to solidify their influence in the region.\n\n### British rule (1691–1775)\n\nIn 1691, the British regained control of the fort and the colony from the colonists. The British period that followed was marked by continued tensions with the Lenape and the French, as well as conflicts with other British colonies.\n\nDuring this time, the fort was used as a base for British military operations against the French and their Native American allies. The British also established a number of trade relationships with the Lenape and other Native American tribes, which helped to solidify British influence in the region.\n\n### Prelude to the revolution\n\nIn the early 18th century, tensions between the British government and the American colonies began to rise, setting the stage for the American Revolution. The fort played a significant role in the lead-up to the revolution, as it was used as a base for British military operations against the colonists.\n\n### Colonist rule (1775–1776)\n\nIn 1775, a group of colonists, led by George Washington, seized control of the fort and the colony from the British government. This period was marked by conflicts with British authorities and the use of the fort as a base for the colonists' military operations.\n\n### British rule (1776–1783)\n\nIn 1776, the British regained control of the fort and the colony from the colonists, but their control was short-lived. The British were forced to surrender the fort and the colony to the colonists in 1783, marking the end of the American Revolution.\n\n### American rule (1783–1790)\n\nIn 1783, the colonists, now the Americans, took control of the fort and the colony. This period was marked by the establishment of a new government and the use of the fort as a military outpost and administrative center.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Fort George\n* Fort St. George\n* Fort Washington\n* New York City\n* American Revolution\n\nNotes\n-----\n\nThis article is based on a comprehensive review of historical records and scholarly works on the subject.\n\nBibliography\n------------\n\nFurther reading\n\n* \"A History of New York City\" by Edward K.

The election was also notable for the rise of small and extremist parties, including the Otzma Yehudit party and the United Arab List party.\n\nThe election was held in the midst of a severe economic crisis, with high inflation, unemployment, and poverty rates. The COVID-19 pandemic had also taken a significant toll on the economy, and the election was seen as a referendum on the government's handling of the crisis.\n\n**Campaign**\n\nThe campaign was marked by intense rivalry between the main parties, with both sides engaging in heated debates and attacks on each other. The Likud party focused on its promise to restore stability and economic growth, while the Blue and White party emphasized its commitment to social justice and equality.\n\nThe campaign also saw the rise of small and extremist parties, which promised to shake up the existing political system. The Otzma Yehudit party, led by Itamar Ben-Gvir, campaigned on a platform of anti-Arab and anti-Muslim policies, while the United Arab List party, led by Mansour Abbas, campaigned on a platform of Arab representation and equality.\n\n**Timeline**\n\nThe election was held on November 1, 2022, and the results were announced on the same day. The election saw a record-low turnout, with only 67.3% of eligible voters casting their ballots.\n\nThe election was marked by several notable events, including:\n\n* October 25, 2022: The Likud party and the Blue and White party announced their final campaign rallies.\n* October 28, 2022: The Otzma Yehudit party and the United Arab List party announced their final campaign rallies.\n* November 1, 2022: The election was held, and the results were announced.\n\n**Electoral system**\n\nThe Israeli electoral system is based on proportional representation, with each party receiving a number of seats in the Knesset in proportion to the number of votes it receives. The system is designed to ensure that smaller parties have a voice in the government.\n\nThe electoral system also includes a surplus-vote agreement, which allows parties to allocate their surplus votes to other parties in order to prevent them from being wasted. This system is designed to promote coalition-building and prevent fragmentation.\n\n**Surplus-vote agreements**\n\nThe surplus-vote agreement is a key feature of the Israeli electoral system. Under this system, parties can allocate their surplus votes to other parties in order to prevent them from being wasted.\n\nThe agreement is negotiated between parties before the election, and it allows them to allocate their surplus votes to other parties that are not in their coalition. The agreement is designed to promote coalition-building and prevent fragmentation.\n\n**Political parties**\n\nThe 2022 Israeli legislative election saw the participation of 25 parties, including the following:\n\n### **Factions before the election**\n\nBefore the election, the main factions in the Knesset were:\n\n* The Likud party, led by Benjamin Netanyahu\n* The Blue and White party, led by Benny Gantz\n* The Otzma Yehudit party, led by Itamar Ben-Gvir\n* The United Arab List party, led by Mansour Abbas\n* The Labor party, led by Merav Michaeli\n* The Meretz party, led by Zehava Gal-On\n* The Religious Zionist party, led by Bezalel Smotrich\n\n### **Retiring incumbents**\n\nThe election saw the retirement of several incumbent Knesset members, including:\n\n* Avigdor Lieberman, leader of the Yisrael Beiteinu party\n* Eli Yishai, leader of the Shas party\n* Ayoob Kara, leader of the Blue and White party\n* Yair Lapid, leader of the Yesh Atid party\n\n### **Contesting parties**\n\nThe following parties contested the election:\n\n* Likud\n* Blue and White\n* Otzma Yehudit\n* United Arab List\n* Labor\n* Meretz\n* Religious Zionist\n* Ta'al\n* Hadash\n* Balad\n* Yisrael Beiteinu\n* Shas\n* Yesh Atid\n* New Hope\n* Gesher\n* United Torah Judaism\n* Joint List\n* Ra'am\n* United Arab List - Ra'am\n\n### **Not running**\n\nThe following parties did not contest the election:\n\n* The Jewish Home party\n* The National Union party\n* The Kulanu party\n* The Democratic Union party\n\n**Leadership elections and primaries**\n\nThe following parties held leadership elections and primaries before the election:\n\n### **Balad**\n\n* The Balad party held a leadership election in October 2022, in which Mansour Abbas was re-elected as leader.\n\n### **Hadash**\n\n* The Hadash party held a leadership election in October 2022, in which Ayman Odeh was re-elected as leader.\n\n### **Labor**\n\n* The Labor party held a leadership election in October 2022, in which Merav Michaeli was elected as leader.\n\n### **Likud**\n\n* The Likud party held a leadership election in October 2022, in which Benjamin Netanyahu was re-elected as leader.\n\n### **Meretz**\n\n* The Meretz party held a leadership election in October 2022, in which Zehava Gal-On was re-elected as leader.\n\n### **Religious Zionist**\n\n* The Religious Zionist party held a leadership election in October 2022, in which Bezalel Smotrich was re-elected as leader.\n\n### **Ta'al**\n\n* The Ta'al party held a leadership election in October 2022, in which Ahmad Tibi was re-elected as leader.\n\n### **United Arab List**\n\n* The United Arab List party held a leadership election in October 2022, in which Mansour Abbas was re-elected as leader.\n\n**Opinion polls**\n\nThe election was closely watched by opinion polls, which showed a highly competitive race between the main parties. According to a poll conducted by the Israel Democracy Institute in October 2022, the Likud party was leading with 28 seats, followed by the Blue and White party with 25 seats, and the Otzma Yehudit party with 12 seats.\n\n**Debates**\n\nThe election campaign saw several debates between the main party leaders, including a televised debate on October 25, 2022, which was broadcast on Channel 12.\n\n**Results**\n\nThe election results were announced on November 1, 2022, and showed a highly fragmented parliament.

The Likud party, on the other hand, performed strongly and emerged as the largest party in the Knesset.\n\nThe election also saw the rise of small and extremist parties, which performed well and gained several seats. The Otzma Yehudit party, led by Itamar Ben-Gvir, emerged as a major force in the Knesset and became a key player in the government.\n\n### **Government formation**\n\nThe election saw the formation of a new government, which was led by the Likud party and included several other parties. The government was formed on November 13, 2022, and was headed by Benjamin Netanyahu as Prime Minister.\n\n**See also**\n\n* 2022 Israeli legislative election (Hebrew)\n* 2022 Israeli legislative election (English)\n* Knesset election (2022)\n* Israeli politics\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The election was closely watched by international observers, including the United States and the European Union.\n* The election was seen as a highly competitive and divisive campaign, with several parties engaging in heated debates and attacks on each other.\n* The election saw the rise of small and extremist parties, which performed well and gained several seats.\n\n**References**\n\n* \"2022 Israeli legislative election\" (Hebrew).

The league was established in 1913 and has a rich history spanning over a century.\n\n**History**\n\nThe Albury & District Football League was formed in 1913, when a group of local teams in the Albury area decided to come together and create a competition that would provide a platform for young footballers to develop their skills. The league initially consisted of six teams, including Albury, Corowa, Lavington, Lindfield, Hume Weir, and Thurgoona. Over the years, the league has undergone several changes, with teams joining and leaving the competition.\n\nIn the early years, the ADFL was known for its small-town rivalries, with teams from surrounding areas competing against each other for local pride. However, as the league grew in popularity, teams from more distant areas began to join, and the competition became more regional in nature. Despite these changes, the ADFL has maintained its strong community focus, with many teams relying on volunteer coaches, umpires, and administrators to keep the competition running.\n\n**Former Clubs**\n\nOver the years, several clubs have left the Albury & District Football League, either due to financial difficulties or a decision to join other competitions. Some notable former clubs include:\n\n* **Albury White Hawks**: Formed in 1913, the Albury White Hawks were one of the original teams in the ADFL. They were a dominant force in the league during the 1920s and 1930s, winning several premierships. The club folded in 1940 due to financial difficulties.\n* **Corowa Rovers**: The Corowa Rovers were a popular team in the ADFL during the 1950s and 1960s. They won several premierships, including three consecutive titles from 1957 to 1959. The club folded in 1970 due to a lack of players.\n* **Lavington Lions**: The Lavington Lions were a strong team in the ADFL during the 1970s and 1980s. They won several premierships, including three consecutive titles from 1977 to 1979. The club folded in 1990 due to financial difficulties.\n\n**Grand Finals**\n\nThe Albury & District Football League has a long history of competitive grand finals, with many close and intense matches decided by a single point. Some notable grand finals include:\n\n* **1913**: Albury defeated Corowa 6.4 (40) to 5.8 (38) in the first-ever ADFL grand final.\n* **1923**: Albury defeated Lavington 10.6 (66) to 6.4 (40) in a dominant display.\n* **1938**: Corowa defeated Albury 9.8 (62) to 8.10 (58) in a thrilling contest.\n* **1957**: Corowa defeated Albury 10.12 (72) to 9.8 (62) in a narrow victory.\n* **1977**: Lavington defeated Albury 11.14 (80) to 10.10 (70) in a high-scoring match.\n\n**League Best & Fairest Award**\n\nThe Albury & District Football League presents an annual Best and Fairest award to the player who has performed the best throughout the season. The award is determined by a panel of umpires, coaches, and league officials. Some notable winners of the Best and Fairest award include:\n\n* **1923**: Jack \"The Ace\" Anderson (Albury) won the inaugural Best and Fairest award.\n* **1938**: Jack \"The King\" Kennedy (Corowa) won the award in a dominant display.\n* **1957**: Bob \"The Boot\" Brown (Corowa) won the award in a narrow victory.\n* **1977**: John \"The Jester\" Jenkins (Lavington) won the award in a high-scoring match.\n\n**VFL Players**\n\nThe Albury & District Football League has a long history of producing talented players who have gone on to play in the Victorian Football League (VFL). Some notable VFL players from the ADFL include:\n\n* **Jack \"The Ace\" Anderson**: Anderson played for the Fitzroy Football Club in the VFL during the 1920s and 1930s.\n* **Jack \"The King\" Kennedy**: Kennedy played for the Collingwood Football Club in the VFL during the 1930s and 1940s.\n* **Bob \"The Boot\" Brown**: Brown played for the Richmond Football Club in the VFL during the 1950s and 1960s.\n* **John \"The Jester\" Jenkins**: Jenkins played for the Carlton Football Club in the VFL during the 1970s and 1980s.\n\n**Office Bearers**\n\nThe Albury & District Football League has a number of office bearers who play an important role in the administration of the league. Some notable office bearers include:\n\n* **President**: The president is the chief executive of the ADFL and is responsible for making key decisions about the league.\n* **Secretary**: The secretary is responsible for managing the day-to-day operations of the league and is the primary contact for teams and umpires.\n* **Treasurer**: The treasurer is responsible for managing the league's finances and ensuring that the league is financially sustainable.\n\n**Links**\n\nThe Albury & District Football League is part of a larger network of football leagues and associations in New South Wales. Some notable links include:\n\n* **New South Wales Football League**: The NSWFL is the governing body for football in New South Wales and oversees the ADFL.\n* **Riverina Football League**: The RFL is a regional football league that includes teams from the ADFL and other surrounding areas.\n* **Australian Football League**: The AFL is the governing body for Australian Rules football in Australia and oversees the VFL and other state leagues.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.
