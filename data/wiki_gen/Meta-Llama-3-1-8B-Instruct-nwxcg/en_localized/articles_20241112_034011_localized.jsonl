The Bugis people have a long and storied history, with a complex and nuanced society that has evolved over centuries.\n\n**Origins and antecedents**\n\n### Toalean — Pre-Austronesian South Sulawesi\n\nThe history of the Bugis people begins with the Toalean civilization, which is believed to have existed in South Sulawesi as far back as 1000 BCE. The Toaleans were a pre-Austronesian people who inhabited the region before the arrival of the Austronesian-speaking people.

Messi won his first La Liga title, his first Copa del Rey, and his first UEFA Champions League title in 2009.\n\n**2012–2014: Record-breaking year and Messidependencia**\n\nIn 2012, Messi had a record-breaking year, scoring 91 goals in 46 appearances for Barcelona, including 50 goals in 38 appearances in La Liga. During this period, Messi's individual talent and skill became so dominant that the media coined the term \"Messidependencia\" to describe the team's reliance on him. Messi won his fourth La Liga title, his second Copa del Rey, and his second UEFA Champions League title in 2011, and his fifth La Liga title, his third Copa del Rey, and his third UEFA Champions League title in 2015.\n\n**2014–2017: Arrival of Luis Enrique and birth of MSN**\n\nIn 2014, Luis Enrique replaced Gerardo Martino as Barcelona's coach, and Messi continued to dominate the team.

He is a skilled finisher and has a keen eye for goal, often scoring from distance and in one-on-one situations.\n\n**Reception**\n\n**Comparisons with Cristiano Ronaldo**\n\nMessi and Cristiano Ronaldo are often compared as two of the greatest players of all time. Both players have won numerous honors and accolades, including multiple Ballon d'Or awards and UEFA Champions League titles.

From the early days of professional tennis to the modern era, various tours and ranking systems have been established to promote competition, provide a framework for players to measure their progress, and determine the best players in the world.\n\n**World Championship Tours**\n\nThe World Championship tours, also known as the ATP World Tour and the WTA Tour, are the most prestigious professional tennis tours in the world. These tours are organized by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) and the Women's Tennis Association (WTA), respectively, and feature the top players from around the world competing in tournaments.\n\nThe ATP World Tour, established in 1990, is the top-level men's professional tennis tour. It features 64 tournaments, including the four Grand Slam events (Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, and US Open), 11 ATP Masters 1000 events, and 39 ATP 500 and 250 events. The tour is divided into several categories, with the highest category being the ATP Finals, which features the top eight players in the world.\n\nThe WTA Tour, established in 1973, is the top-level women's professional tennis tour. It features 54 tournaments, including the four Grand Slam events, 10 WTA Premier Mandatory and Premier 5 events, and 30 WTA International events. The tour is also divided into several categories, with the highest category being the WTA Finals, which features the top eight players in the world.\n\n**Winners**\n\nThe winners of the World Championship tours are determined by a points-based system, with players earning points based on their performance in tournaments. The player with the most points at the end of the year is crowned the world champion. Here are some of the recent winners of the World Championship tours:\n\n* ATP World Tour: Novak Djokovic (2011-2016), Rafael Nadal (2008-2010, 2017-2020), Roger Federer (2004-2007, 2009), Andy Murray (2016), Stan Wawrinka (2014), and Marin Cilic (2014).\n* WTA Tour: Serena Williams (2013-2017), Maria Sharapova (2004-2007, 2012-2013), Justine Henin (2007-2008), Kim Clijsters (2003, 2005, 2010-2011), and Martina Hingis (1997, 1998).\n\n**Tournament Ranking Series**\n\nThe tournament ranking series is a system used to rank players based on their performance in tournaments. The system is used by both the ATP and WTA tours, and is designed to provide a more accurate measure of a player's ability than the World Championship tours. The ranking series is based on a points system, with players earning points based on their performance in tournaments.\n\nThe ATP tournament ranking series features 51 tournaments, including the four Grand Slam events, 11 ATP Masters 1000 events, and 36 ATP 500 and 250 events. The WTA tournament ranking series features 43 tournaments, including the four Grand Slam events, 10 WTA Premier Mandatory and Premier 5 events, and 29 WTA International events.\n\n**Winners**\n\nThe winners of the tournament ranking series are determined by a points-based system, with players earning points based on their performance in tournaments. The player with the most points at the end of the year is crowned the champion. Here are some of the recent winners of the tournament ranking series:\n\n* ATP tournament ranking series: Novak Djokovic (2011-2016), Rafael Nadal (2008-2010, 2017-2020), Roger Federer (2004-2007, 2009), Andy Murray (2016), Stan Wawrinka (2014), and Marin Cilic (2014).\n* WTA tournament ranking series: Serena Williams (2013-2017), Maria Sharapova (2004-2007, 2012-2013), Justine Henin (2007-2008), Kim Clijsters (2003, 2005, 2010-2011), and Martina Hingis (1997, 1998).\n\n**Other Professional Tours**\n\nIn addition to the World Championship tours and tournament ranking series, there are several other professional tours that feature a range of players from around the world. These tours provide a platform for players to compete and gain experience, and can be a stepping stone to the higher-level tours.\n\n**Women**\n\nThe WTA 125K series is a women's professional tennis tour that features 16 tournaments, with a total prize money of $1.25 million. The tour is aimed at providing a platform for players who are not yet established on the WTA Tour, and offers a range of events from $125,000 to $250,000.\n\nThe ITF Women's Circuit is a women's professional tennis tour that features over 500 tournaments, with a total prize money of $12 million.

The election was held after the resignation of the party's previous leader, Nicola Sturgeon, on February 15, 2023. The election process was overseen by the SNP's National Executive Committee.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Scottish National Party has been the dominant force in Scottish politics since the 2015 general election. Under the leadership of Nicola Sturgeon, the party has been instrumental in shaping the country's politics and has maintained a strong presence in the Scottish Parliament. The party's leadership election was sparked by Sturgeon's announcement that she would be stepping down as leader. The election was seen as a significant moment for the party, with several high-profile candidates vying for the top spot.\n\n**Issues**\n\nThe 2023 SNP leadership election was shaped by several key issues, including:\n\n### **Economics**\n\nThe economy was a major focus of the leadership election, with candidates vying for the party's economic vision for Scotland. The SNP has traditionally been seen as a left-of-centre party, and the election saw several candidates proposing different approaches to economic policy. Some candidates, such as Kate Forbes, emphasized the need for a more business-friendly approach, while others, such as Humza Yousaf, argued that the party needed to focus on reducing poverty and inequality.\n\n### **Independence**\n\nThe issue of Scottish independence was also a major focus of the leadership election. The SNP has long been committed to the goal of Scottish independence, and the election saw several candidates vying to be the party's next leader on the issue. Some candidates, such as Ash Regan, emphasized the need for a more focused approach to independence, while others, such as Humza Yousaf, argued that the party needed to take a more nuanced approach to the issue.\n\n### **Gender recognition reform**\n\nThe issue of gender recognition reform was also a major focus of the leadership election. The SNP has long been committed to the goal of reforming Scotland's gender recognition laws, and the election saw several candidates vying to be the party's next leader on the issue. Some candidates, such as Kate Forbes, emphasized the need for a more cautious approach to reform, while others, such as Humza Yousaf, argued that the party needed to take a more radical approach to the issue.\n\n**Campaign**\n\nThe 2023 SNP leadership election campaign was a highly contested one, with several high-profile candidates vying for the top spot. The campaign was characterized by a series of hustings, debates, and media appearances, as well as a series of online and offline campaigns.\n\n### **Nomination period**\n\nThe nomination period for the leadership election was a three-week period during which candidates could be nominated by SNP members. The nomination period was marked by a series of high-profile announcements, including the decision by Humza Yousaf to stand for the leadership.\n\n### **Kate Forbes**\n\nKate Forbes, the former Finance Secretary for Scotland, was one of the first candidates to announce her candidacy for the leadership. Forbes emphasized the need for a more business-friendly approach to economic policy, and argued that the party needed to take a more nuanced approach to independence.\n\n### **Ash Regan**\n\nAsh Regan, the former Social Justice Secretary for Scotland, was another high-profile candidate to announce her candidacy for the leadership. Regan emphasized the need for a more focused approach to independence, and argued that the party needed to prioritize the needs of Scotland's most vulnerable communities.\n\n### **Humza Yousaf**\n\nHumza Yousaf, the former Health Secretary for Scotland, was the third high-profile candidate to announce his candidacy for the leadership. Yousaf argued that the party needed to take a more radical approach to gender recognition reform, and emphasized the need for a more nuanced approach to independence.\n\n### **Hustings**\n\nThe hustings were a series of debates and discussions held between the candidates, and were an important part of the leadership election campaign. The hustings were marked by a series of heated exchanges, including a row over membership numbers.\n\n### **Row about membership numbers**\n\nA row broke out during the hustings over the number of SNP members, with some candidates arguing that the party's membership numbers were artificially inflated. The row was sparked by a comment made by Kate Forbes, who suggested that the party's membership numbers were not as high as they claimed.\n\n**Election process**\n\nThe election process for the 2023 SNP leadership election was overseen by the party's National Executive Committee. The election was a one-member-one-vote system, in which every SNP member had a single vote.\n\n**Candidates**\n\nSeveral candidates announced their intention to stand for the leadership, but only a few were ultimately declared.\n\n### **Declared**\n\nThe following candidates were declared to be standing for the leadership:\n\n* Kate Forbes\n* Ash Regan\n* Humza Yousaf\n\n### **Declined**\n\nThe following candidates declined to stand for the leadership:\n\n* Nicola Sturgeon\n* John Swinney\n* Shona Robison\n\n### **Endorsements**\n\nSeveral candidates received endorsements from high-profile SNP members and MSPs, including:\n\n#### **Kate Forbes**\n\n* Mairi Gouge, MSP for Aberdeen South and North\n* Liam Kerr, MSP for North East Scotland\n\n#### **Ash Regan**\n\n* Richard Leonard, former leader of the Scottish Labour Party\n* Linda Fabiani, MSP for East Scotland\n\n#### **Humza Yousaf**\n\n* Anas Sarwar, leader of the Scottish Labour Party\n* Jenny Marra, MSP for North East Scotland\n\n#### **Declined to endorse**\n\nSeveral candidates declined to endorse any of the declared candidates, including:\n\n* Nicola Sturgeon\n* John Swinney\n* Shona Robison\n\n**Debates**\n\nThe debates were a series of discussions and debates held between the candidates, and were an important part of the leadership election campaign.

The character of Indiana Jones, created by George Lucas and Steven Spielberg, has become an iconic figure in popular culture. With the release of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, film enthusiasts and scholars alike are eager to explore the latest installment in the franchise.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film takes place in 1969, during the height of the Cold War. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford), a retired professor and expert in antiquities, is living in a monastery in New Mexico. However, his quiet life is disrupted by the arrival of his goddaughter, Helena Shaw (Phoebe Waller-Bridge), who has been tracking down a mysterious artifact known as the Dial of Destiny. The dial, an ancient relic with the power to manipulate time itself, is believed to have been created by the Greek god Apollo.\n\nAs Helena and Indiana embark on a perilous journey to find the dial, they soon discover that they are not the only ones searching for it. A rival treasure hunter, Jürgen Voller (Mads Mikkelsen), will stop at nothing to claim the dial and use its power to gain control over world events. Along the way, Indiana and Helena encounter a series of challenges, including treacherous landscapes, treacherous enemies, and even a run-in with a young Adolf Hitler.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones\n* Phoebe Waller-Bridge as Helena Shaw\n* Mads Mikkelsen as Jürgen Voller\n* Thomas Kretschmann as Theodor \"Doomsday\" Baha\n* Antonio Banderas as Juan \"Tomás\" Banderas\n* Toby Jones as Basil Shaw\n* Boyd Holbrook as Glen Miller\n* Shaunette Renée Wilson as Marcus Brody\n\n**Production**\n\n### Development\n\nThe development of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny began in 2017, shortly after the release of the fourth installment in the franchise, Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. James Mangold, who had previously directed the critically acclaimed film The Wolverine, was approached by Lucasfilm to helm the new Indiana Jones film. Mangold brought along a team of writers, including Jez and John-Henry Butterworth, who had previously worked on the film Kingsman: The Secret Service.\n\n### Pre-production\n\nPre-production on the film began in 2018, with Harrison Ford and Phoebe Waller-Bridge attached to star in the movie. The script underwent several drafts, with Mangold and the writers working to refine the story and characters. Filming was initially set to take place in 2019, but production was delayed due to logistical issues.\n\n### Casting\n\nThe casting process for the film was extensive, with several actors and actresses auditioning for roles in the movie. Mads Mikkelsen was cast as Jürgen Voller, a rival treasure hunter who serves as the main antagonist. Thomas Kretschmann was also cast in the film, playing the role of Theodor \"Doomsday\" Baha, a former Nazi officer who is obsessed with the dial.\n\n### Filming\n\nFilming on the movie began in 2020, with the production team shooting on location in various countries, including the United Kingdom, Italy, and Spain. The film's production was hampered by the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced the crew to take several breaks and adapt to new safety protocols.\n\n### Visual effects\n\nThe visual effects in the film were handled by Industrial Light & Magic, a renowned visual effects company that has worked on several high-profile films, including the Star Wars and Indiana Jones franchises. The film's visual effects team used a combination of practical and CGI effects to bring the film's action sequences and stunts to life.\n\n#### De-aging\n\nOne of the most impressive aspects of the film's visual effects is the de-aging technology used to make Harrison Ford look younger. The technology, developed by Industrial Light & Magic, uses AI to analyze the actor's facial structure and create a digital replica of his younger self. The technology was used extensively in the film's opening sequence, where Indiana Jones is shown as a younger man.\n\n### Music\n\nThe music for the film was composed by John Williams, who has been the primary composer on the Indiana Jones franchise for over three decades. The score is a fitting tribute to the franchise's rich musical heritage, incorporating several themes and motifs from previous Indiana Jones films.\n\n**Themes and influences**\n\nIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny explores several themes, including the power of time and the consequences of playing with forces beyond one's control. The film also touches on the theme of legacy, as Indiana Jones struggles to come to terms with his own mortality and the impact he has had on the world.\n\nThe film is also influenced by the works of H.P. Lovecraft, a horror author who wrote extensively on the theme of ancient, eldritch powers. The film's depiction of the Dial of Destiny, a device with the power to manipulate time itself, is reminiscent of Lovecraft's concept of the Elder Gods.\n\n**Release**\n\n### Marketing\n\nThe marketing campaign for the film began in 2022, with the release of several trailers and promotional materials. The film's trailers, which showcase the film's action sequences and stunts, have been well-received by fans and critics alike.\n\n### Theatrical\n\nIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny was released in theaters on June 30, 2023, in several countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. The film has been released in several formats, including 2D and 3D, as well as IMAX and Dolby Cinema.\n\n### Home media\n\nThe film is set to be released on home media in several formats, including Blu-ray, DVD, and digital download. The home media release will include several special features, including behind-the-scenes footage, deleted scenes, and audio commentary from the director and cast.\n\n**Reception**\n\n### Box office\n\nIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny has been a commercial success, grossing over $700 million at the global box office. The film's opening weekend was the largest for an Indiana Jones film, with the movie grossing over $200 million in the United States and over $100 million in other countries.\n\n### Critical response\n\nThe film has received widespread critical acclaim, with many praising the film's action sequences, stunts, and visuals. The film has a 92% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with many critics praising the film's nostalgic value and sense of wonder.\n\n### Accolades\n\nIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny has received several awards and nominations, including several Academy Award nominations for Best Visual Effects and Best Sound Editing. The film has also received several Critics' Choice Awards nominations, including Best Action Movie and Best Visual Effects.\n\n**Future**\n\nIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is the fifth installment in the Indiana Jones franchise, and it remains to be seen whether the character will continue to be featured in future films. However, with the film's success and the popularity of the character, it is likely that Indiana Jones will continue to be a staple of popular culture for years to come.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Indiana Jones\n* Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\n* Raiders of the Lost Ark\n* The Last Crusade\n* The Temple of Doom\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The film's script was written by Jez and John-Henry Butterworth, with David Koepp serving as a consultant.\n* The film's production was handled by Lucasfilm and Industrial Light & Magic.\n* The film's music was composed by John Williams.\n* The film's visual effects were handled by Industrial Light & Magic.\n\n**References**\n\n* None\n\n**External links**\n\n* Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny on IMDb\n* Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny on Rotten Tomatoes\n* Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny on Metacritic", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

In South Africa, testate succession is governed by the deceased estate laws, which provide a framework for the administration of a deceased person's estate.\n\n**Freedom of Testation**\n\nThe freedom of testation is the right of a person to dispose of their property as they wish, subject to certain limitations. In South Africa, the law recognizes the freedom of testation, which means that a person can dispose of their property in any way they see fit, as long as it is not contrary to public policy.\n\n### Limitations\n\nWhile the freedom of testation is recognized, there are certain limitations that apply. These limitations are designed to protect the interests of certain individuals and to prevent the abuse of the freedom of testation.\n\n#### Illegal Dispositions and Those Against Public Policy\n\nA person cannot dispose of their property in a way that is illegal or contrary to public policy. For example, a person cannot leave their property to someone who is not a South African citizen or resident.\n\n#### Subdivision of Agricultural Land\n\nA person cannot subdivide their agricultural land in a way that is not in accordance with the relevant laws and regulations.

This means that they must be free from undue pressure or coercion when making their will.\n\n**Capacity to Witness a Will**\n\nA person must have the capacity to witness a will in order to make a valid will. This means that they must be able to understand the nature and extent of their property and the consequences of their actions.\n\n**Formalities for Execution of a Will**\n\nA will must be executed in accordance with certain formalities in order to be valid.

These requirements include the intention of the testator to make a gift of property, as well as the capacity of the testator to make such a gift.\n\n### Methods of Executing a Valid Will\n\nA will can be executed in a number of ways, including by signing and signature, by certificate, or by witnesses.\n\n### Signing and Signature\n\nA will must be signed by the testator in the presence of witnesses. The signature must be in the testator's handwriting, and it must be dated.\n\n### Certificate\n\nA will can be executed by certificate, which is a document that confirms the testator's intention to make a gift of property.\n\n### Witnesses\n\nA will must be witnessed by two or more people, who must attest to the testator's signature and the testator's intention to make a gift of property.\n\n**Condonation**\n\nCondonation is the act of a person forgiving another person for a wrong or a debt. In South African law, condonation can be used to cancel or forgive a debt or a wrong, but only if the person who is forgiving the debt or wrong has the capacity to do so.\n\n**Invalid Wills**\n\nAn invalid will is a will that is not valid due to a defect or a flaw. There are a number of reasons why a will may be invalid, including lack of testamentary capacity, undue influence, or fraud.\n\n## Revocation\n\nA will can be revoked in a number of ways, including by later will or codicil, by physical or symbolic destruction, or by ademption.\n\n### Right of Revocation\n\nA person has the right to revoke their will at any time before their death.

This period saw the introduction of new building techniques, materials, and designs, which would go on to influence the development of New England architecture for centuries to come.\n\n**# Legend**\n\nThe following abbreviations will be used throughout this article:\n\n* **First Period**: Refers to the period of time from 1660 to 1679, during which the first period houses in Massachusetts were built.\n* **Massachusetts Bay Colony**: The British colony that existed in the region from 1629 to 1691.\n* **New England**: The region in northeastern North America that includes present-day Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut.\n* **Timber-framing**: A building technique that uses wooden frames to construct buildings.\n\n**# 1660–1670**\n\nThe first decade of the First Period saw the introduction of new building techniques and materials to Massachusetts. The Massachusetts Bay Colony had recently been established, and the colonists were eager to establish themselves in their new homes. The earliest first period houses in Massachusetts were typically small, one-room cabins made of wood and thatched with grass or straw.\n\n## Early Influences\n\nThe architecture of the first period houses in Massachusetts was influenced by several factors, including the colony's English heritage and the availability of local materials. The colonists brought their English building traditions with them to the New World, including the use of timber-framing and the construction of gabled roofs.\n\n## Building Techniques\n\nThe first period houses in Massachusetts were constructed using traditional timber-framing techniques. The frame of the house was built using heavy beams of wood, which were mortise-and-tenoned together to form a strong and stable structure. The frame was then filled in with smaller pieces of wood, such as studs and rafters, to create the walls and roof of the house.\n\n## Early Examples\n\nSome of the earliest examples of first period houses in Massachusetts include the following:\n\n* The Fairbanks House, built in Dedham in 1636, which is one of the oldest surviving houses in the United States.\n* The Parson Capen House, built in Topsfield in 1661, which features a large, central chimney and a steeply pitched roof.\n* The Francis Wyman House, built in Salem in 1661, which features a gambrel roof and a central chimney.\n\n**# 1671–1679**\n\nThe second decade of the First Period saw a significant increase in the number of houses being built in Massachusetts. The colony was thriving, and the demand for housing was high. The houses built during this period were larger and more complex than those of the previous decade, and featured a wider range of architectural styles.\n\n## Increased Urbanization\n\nAs the colony grew, more and more people began to move to urban areas, such as Boston and Salem. The houses built in these cities during this period were often larger and more ornate than those in rural areas, and featured a wider range of architectural styles.\n\n## Wider Range of Architectural Styles\n\nThe houses built during this period featured a wider range of architectural styles, including the following:\n\n* The Saltbox style, which features a large, central chimney and a steeply pitched roof.\n* The Gambrel style, which features a gambrel roof and a central chimney.\n* The Cape Cod style, which features a gambrel roof and a central chimney.\n\n## Examples of Houses Built During This Period\n\nSome examples of houses built during this period include the following:\n\n* The Old Manse, built in Concord in 1673, which features a gambrel roof and a central chimney.\n* The Robert Treat Paine House, built in Boston in 1673, which features a gambrel roof and a central chimney.\n* The oldest part of the Jonathan Corwin House, built in Salem in 1677, which features a gambrel roof and a central chimney.\n\n**# See also**\n\n* **History of Massachusetts**\n* **Architecture of Massachusetts**\n* **New England architecture**\n* **Timber-framing**\n* **Gambrel roof**\n* **Saltbox style**\n\n**# Notes**\n\n* This article is a general overview of the first period houses in Massachusetts, and does not include specific details about individual houses.\n* The dates used in this article are approximate, and refer to the time period during which the houses were built.\n* The information used in this article is based on general knowledge and does not include specific citations or references.\n\n**# References**\n\n* \n* \n* \n\n**# External links**\n\n* \n* \n*", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

Launched in July 2023, the platform allows users to post short messages, known as \"threads,\" which can be up to 500 characters in length. The app's primary purpose is to provide a space for users to share their thoughts, experiences, and ideas in a concise and easily consumable format.\n\n**History**\n\n### Predecessor\n\nThe concept of Threads as a social networking app is not entirely new. In 2020, Meta Platforms, Inc. acquired the photo and video sharing platform Instagram, which had already established itself as a prominent social media platform. However, the company's vision for a new platform, which would eventually become Threads, began to take shape in the following years.\n\n### Development and announcement\n\nThe development of Threads began in 2021, with a team of engineers and designers working to create a platform that would allow users to share short messages in a similar format to Twitter and TikTok. In May 2023, Meta Platforms, Inc. announced that the app would be launched in the coming months, with a focus on providing a space for users to share their thoughts and ideas in a concise and easily consumable format.\n\n### Launch\n\nThreads was officially launched on July 5, 2023, with a soft launch in the United States, the United Kingdom, and several other countries. The app was available for download on the App Store and Google Play Store, and users were able to sign up and start posting threads immediately.\n\n**Appearance and features**\n\n### Possibility of open interoperability\n\nOne of the key features of Threads is its potential for open interoperability with other social media platforms. As a decentralized platform, Threads allows users to connect their accounts with other platforms, such as Instagram and Twitter, using standardized APIs. This means that users can share their threads across multiple platforms, creating a seamless and integrated experience.\n\n### Account integration with Instagram\n\nThreads also allows users to integrate their Instagram accounts, enabling them to share their threads directly to their Instagram feed. This integration provides users with a convenient way to share their thoughts and ideas with their Instagram followers, while also allowing them to reach a wider audience on the Threads platform.\n\n### Device compatibility\n\nThreads is available on both iOS and Android devices, and can be accessed through the app or through the web. The app is optimized for mobile devices, providing a smooth and intuitive experience for users on-the-go.\n\n### Censorship attempts\n\nIn the weeks following the launch of Threads, several governments and organizations have attempted to censor the platform. In some countries, Threads has been blocked entirely, while in others, specific content has been censored or removed. These attempts have been met with resistance from the platform's users and administrators, who have argued that censorship undermines the principles of free speech and expression.\n\n### Advertising\n\nThreads does not currently display advertisements, and users are not required to pay to access the platform. However, it is likely that the platform will eventually introduce advertising and other revenue streams to support its operations.\n\n**Userbase**\n\n### Decline in the months after launch\n\nIn the months following the launch of Threads, the platform experienced a significant decline in user base. According to reports, the number of active users on the platform decreased by over 50% in the first six months, with many users citing the lack of features and content as the primary reason for their departure.\n\n### Popularity in Taiwan\n\nDespite the decline in user base elsewhere, Threads has proved unexpectedly popular in Taiwan, where the platform has attracted a large and engaged user base. The platform's popularity in Taiwan has been attributed to a combination of factors, including the language and cultural affinity of the Taiwanese population, as well as the platform's ease of use and intuitive interface.\n\n**Responses**\n\n### Intellectual property dispute\n\nIn August 2023, Meta Platforms, Inc. was sued by a group of artists and writers who claimed that the platform's use of copyrighted materials without permission was a breach of their intellectual property rights. The lawsuit was settled out of court, with Meta agreeing to pay a significant sum to the plaintiffs.\n\n### Data privacy\n\nIn September 2023, it was revealed that Threads had been collecting and storing user data without their consent. The incident sparked widespread outrage, and Meta was forced to issue a statement apologizing for the mistake and assuring users that their data would be deleted.\n\n### State media\n\nIn several countries, Threads has been criticized for allowing state media outlets to spread propaganda and disinformation. The platform has been accused of failing to effectively moderate content, allowing malicious actors to spread false information and manipulate public opinion.\n\n### Imitating other platforms\n\nThreads has been accused of imitating other social media platforms, such as Twitter and TikTok, without providing any unique features or functionality. The platform's lack of innovation and originality has been criticized by some as a sign of laziness and a lack of vision.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Meta Platforms, Inc.\n* Instagram\n* Twitter\n* TikTok\n* Social media\n* Online communities\n\n**References**\n\n(Note: No references are provided as per your request)\n\n**Further reading**\n\n* \"The Future of Social Media: Trends and Predictions\" by [Author]\n* \"The Rise of Decentralized Social Media\" by [Author]\n* \"The Impact of Social Media on Society\" by [Author]\n\n**External links**\n\n* Threads (official website)\n* Meta Platforms, Inc.

Spanning over 150 kilometers, the trail takes hikers through a unique and diverse landscape of mountains, valleys, and coastlines, featuring an impressive array of over 100 ancient watchtowers, known as \"torri\".\n\nHistory\n\nThe Path of 100 Towers is situated in the northwestern part of Sardinia, an island with a rich history dating back to the ancient civilizations of the Phoenicians, Carthaginians, and Romans. The watchtowers, which are the main attraction of the trail, were built by the Pisans and the Genoese during the Middle Ages to protect the coastline from pirate attacks and to monitor the sea trade. Many of these towers have been restored and now serve as a testament to the region's complex history and cultural heritage.\n\nTrekking routes\n\nThe Path of 100 Towers can be hiked in either direction, but the most common itinerary starts from the town of Castelsardo, a picturesque village perched on a cliff overlooking the Tyrrhenian Sea, and ends in the town of Santa Maria la Palma, a charming coastal town known for its beautiful beaches and seafood restaurants. The trail takes hikers through a variety of landscapes, including rugged mountains, rolling hills, and coastal cliffs, offering breathtaking views of the surrounding countryside.\n\nThe trail is well-marked and maintained, with clear signs and informative panels providing information about the history, geology, and flora and fauna of the area. Hikers can choose to complete the entire trail in several days, camping overnight in designated areas, or opt for a more leisurely pace, taking breaks to explore the local towns and villages.\n\nTowers\n\nThe watchtowers that line the Path of 100 Towers are the main attraction of the trail, and each one has its own unique character and history. The towers were built to serve as lookouts, signal stations, and fortifications, and many have been restored to their original appearance.\n\nMain towers\n\nSome of the most impressive towers along the trail include the Tower of Castelsardo, a 13th-century tower that dominates the town of Castelsardo; the Tower of Tergu, a 14th-century tower that offers stunning views of the surrounding countryside; and the Tower of Luogosanto, a 16th-century tower that has been converted into a museum.\n\nFlora and Fauna\n\nThe Path of 100 Towers passes through a variety of landscapes, each with its own unique flora and fauna. The trail takes hikers through Mediterranean scrub, where they can see a variety of plants and animals that are typical of the region, including oak trees, holm oaks, and juniper trees, as well as birds such as the golden eagle, the peregrine falcon, and the eagle owl.\n\nLagoon\n\nThe trail also passes through the Lagoon of Stintino, a protected nature reserve that is home to a variety of birds, including the pink flamingo, the grey heron, and the avocet. The lagoon is also a popular spot for water sports, including sailing, kayaking, and paddleboarding.\n\nBooks\n\nThe Path of 100 Towers has been featured in several books, including \"Sardinia on Foot\" by John Fisher, which provides a comprehensive guide to the island's hiking trails, and \"The Path of 100 Towers\" by Marco Fossati, which offers a detailed account of the trail's history and geology.\n\nCuriosities\n\nSome of the most interesting curiosities along the Path of 100 Towers include the ancient Phoenician temple of Tharros, which is located near the town of Tharros; the 16th-century Genoese tower of Castelsardo, which offers stunning views of the surrounding countryside; and the Roman ruins of the town of Sassari, which date back to the 1st century BC.\n\nSimilar treks\n\nThe Path of 100 Towers is similar to other long-distance hiking trails in Sardinia, including the Gennargentu National Park trail, which takes hikers through a rugged and remote landscape of mountains and valleys, and the Sarrabus-Flat Grounds trail, which passes through a variety of landscapes, including coastal cliffs, beaches, and forests.\n\nSee also\n\n* Sardinia\n* Hiking trails of Italy\n* Watchtowers of Sardinia\n* Castelsardo\n* Santa Maria la Palma\n\nGallery\n\n* Tower of Castelsardo\n* Tower of Tergu\n* Tower of Luogosanto\n* Lagoon of Stintino\n* Mediterranean scrub\n* Roman ruins of Sassari\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n* Path of 100 Towers official website\n* Sardinia tourism website\n* Italian National Parks website\n* Wikipedia article on Sardinia\n* Wikipedia article on Hiking trails of Italy", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The film is a direct sequel to the 1987 original and takes place in the Comanche Nation in 1719, following Naru, a young Comanche woman who becomes the tribe's first great hunter.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film begins with a Comanche tribe, led by Naru's father, Genghis, struggling to survive in the harsh environment of the Texas frontier. Naru, a skilled and ambitious young woman, is eager to prove herself as a hunter and earn the respect of her tribe. While out on a hunt, Naru and her friends encounter a technological alien creature, known as the Yautja, which has arrived on Earth to hunt humans. The creature, armed with advanced technology and hunting skills, begins to stalk and kill the Comanche tribe, forcing Naru and her friends to fight for survival.\n\nAs the body count rises, Naru and her friends are forced to flee their village and seek refuge in the nearby forest, where they are hunted by the Yautja. Along the way, Naru discovers that the creature is drawn to the vibrations of its prey's heartbeat and that she must use her knowledge of the forest and her hunting skills to outwit the creature. The film culminates in a tense and action-packed showdown between Naru and the Yautja, with the fate of her tribe hanging in the balance.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Amber Midthunder as Naru, a young Comanche woman and the main protagonist\n* Dakota Beavers as Taabe, Naru's younger brother\n* Sturgill Simpson as Red Sun, a seasoned hunter and Naru's mentor\n* Michelle Thrush as Akua, a Comanche elder and Naru's grandmother\n* Julian Black Antelope as Genghis, Naru's father and the leader of the Comanche tribe\n* Lance Reddick as Captain Harlan, a soldier from the Spanish Empire\n\n**Production**\n\n#### Development and casting\n\nPrey was in development for over a decade, with several writers and directors attached to the project over the years.

The film's cinematography was handled by Jeff Cutter, who used a combination of handheld and static shots to create a sense of tension and immediacy.\n\n#### Language\n\nThe film features a mix of English and Comanche dialogue, with the Comanche language used in many scenes to create a sense of authenticity and cultural connection.\n\n#### Visual effects\n\nThe Yautja was created using a combination of practical and visual effects, with the creature's design inspired by the original Predator film.

The soundtrack features a mix of traditional Comanche music and electronic elements, with the score released to critical acclaim.\n\n**Historical accuracy**\n\nThe film takes creative liberties with the historical period in which it is set, using the Comanche Nation as a backdrop for a science fiction story. However, the film's cultural consultant, James Welch, worked closely with the director to ensure that the film's portrayal of the Comanche culture was respectful and accurate.\n\n**Release**\n\nPrey was released on August 5, 2022, in the United States and Canada, with a global release following shortly thereafter.
