He is the second African American to serve on the Court after Thurgood Marshall.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nClarence Thomas was born on June 23, 1948, in Pin Point, Georgia, a small rural community near Savannah. He was the second of three children born to Leola and M.C. Thomas, a farmer and a factory worker, respectively. Thomas's parents stressed the importance of education, and he was raised in a devoutly Catholic household.\n\nThomas's family moved to Savannah when he was young, and he attended the segregated St. Pius X High School. He was an excellent student and was accepted into the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts, where he studied English literature and philosophy.\n\n**College of the Holy Cross and Yale Law School**\n\nAt the College of the Holy Cross, Thomas excelled academically and was a member of the debate team. He graduated in 1971 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English literature and philosophy. Thomas then attended Yale Law School, where he earned his Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree in 1974.\n\nDuring his time at Yale, Thomas was a member of the Yale Law Journal and worked as a research assistant for Professor Thomas Emerson. He also became interested in libertarian thought and was influenced by the ideas of Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman.\n\n**Early Legal Career**\n\nAfter graduating from Yale Law School, Thomas worked as a law clerk for Judge Anthony Kennedy of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. In 1979, he became an assistant attorney general for the state of Missouri, where he worked under Attorney General John Danforth.\n\nIn 1981, Thomas joined the U.S. Department of Education as an assistant secretary for civil rights. He worked under Secretary Terrel Bell and was responsible for enforcing federal civil rights laws in education.\n\n**District of Columbia Court of Appeals**\n\nIn 1988, President Ronald Reagan nominated Thomas to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Thomas was confirmed by the Senate in 1990 and served on the court for over a year before being nominated to the Supreme Court.\n\n**Nomination to the Supreme Court**\n\nOn July 1, 1991, President George H.W. Bush nominated Thomas to replace Thurgood Marshall on the Supreme Court. The nomination was met with controversy, particularly following allegations of sexual harassment made by Anita Hill, a former colleague of Thomas's at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).\n\n**Anita Hill Accusations**\n\nHill alleged that Thomas had made unwanted advances and engaged in behavior that created a hostile work environment during her time working with him at the EEOC. Thomas denied the allegations, and a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing was held to investigate the claims.\n\n### Second Hearing\n\nA second hearing was held on October 11, 1991, at which Hill testified again. Thomas also testified, denying the allegations and accusing Hill of perjury.\n\n**Senate Votes**\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee voted to send Thomas's nomination to the full Senate, where it was debated and ultimately confirmed on October 15, 1991, by a vote of 52-48.\n\n**Supreme Court of the United States**\n\nThomas was sworn in as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court on October 23, 1991.

The event was the 44th edition of the World Women's Curling Championship, and it was organized by the World Curling Federation (WCF).\n\n**Qualification**\n\nThe qualification process for the 2022 World Women's Curling Championship involved several countries. The top six teams from the 2021 World Women's Curling Championship, as well as the top two teams from the 2021 World Women's Curling Qualification Event, qualified directly for the championship.\n\n### Russian participation\n\nDue to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, Russia was not allowed to participate in the championship. The WCF decided to replace Russia with the next highest-ranked team from the 2021 World Women's Curling Qualification Event, which was Switzerland.\n\n### COVID-19 issues\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the championship. Several teams had to isolate due to positive cases of COVID-19, and some matches were postponed or rescheduled. The WCF implemented strict health and safety protocols to minimize the risk of transmission.\n\n**Scotland**\n\nThe Scottish team, skipped by Eve Muirhead, was one of the top favorites to win the championship. They had a strong record in the round-robin stage, but they struggled in the playoffs, ultimately finishing fourth.\n\n**Japan**\n\nThe Japanese team, skipped by Satsuki Fujisawa, was another strong contender. They had a good record in the round-robin stage, but they lost to Sweden in the semifinals.\n\n**Teams**\n\nThe 2022 World Women's Curling Championship featured 13 teams from around the world.

One of the main changes was the introduction of a \"free guard zone,\" which prohibits teams from sweeping the stone in a small area in front of the guard. This change was introduced to promote more strategic play and to reduce the risk of injury.\n\n**Round-robin standings**\n\nThe round-robin stage of the championship consisted of 16 draws, with each team playing every other team once.

Founded in 1983, the bank quickly grew to become one of the largest and most influential financial institutions in the tech industry.\n\n# Foundation and early growth\n\nSVB was founded on October 17, 1983, by Robert Medearis, a Stanford University graduate and a former employee of Wells Fargo Bank. The bank was initially capitalized with $3 million in funding from Medearis and a group of venture capitalists. The bank's early focus was on providing financial services to the growing number of technology startups in the Silicon Valley area. SVB's founders recognized the unique needs of these companies, which often required specialized banking services and a deep understanding of the tech industry.\n\nIn its early years, SVB operated from a small office in Santa Clara, California, and employed a handful of employees. However, the bank quickly gained traction, and its customer base grew rapidly. By the end of the 1980s, SVB had established itself as a leading provider of financial services to the tech industry, with a reputation for innovative products and exceptional customer service.\n\n# Expansion\n\nThroughout the 1990s and 2000s, SVB expanded its operations significantly, both organically and through strategic acquisitions. The bank established a presence in major tech hubs around the world, including New York City, Los Angeles, Seattle, and London. SVB also expanded its range of financial services, offering a full suite of banking products, including cash management, investment banking, and capital markets.\n\nIn 1999, SVB acquired Bay Area Bank, a commercial bank based in San Francisco, for $45 million. This acquisition marked a significant expansion of SVB's presence in the San Francisco Bay Area and provided the bank with access to a new customer base. In 2008, SVB acquired Boulder Valley Bank, a community bank based in Colorado, for $58 million. This acquisition marked a significant expansion of SVB's presence in the Rocky Mountain region.\n\n# Operations in lead-up to collapse\n\n## Business model\n\nSVB's business model was centered around serving the financial needs of technology and life science companies. The bank offered a range of financial products and services, including cash management, investment banking, and capital markets. SVB also provided specialized services, such as venture debt, which was designed to help startups and early-stage companies access capital.\n\nSVB's business model was built around a deep understanding of the tech industry and a commitment to delivering exceptional customer service. The bank's employees were highly knowledgeable about the tech industry and were able to provide customized financial solutions to meet the unique needs of SVB's clients.\n\n## Facilities\n\nSVB operated a network of facilities across the United States and internationally. The bank's headquarters was located in Santa Clara, California, and it had a significant presence in San Francisco, New York City, and other major tech hubs.\n\nIn 2015, SVB opened a new headquarters building in Santa Clara, which was designed to be a hub for innovation and collaboration. The building featured a range of amenities, including a rooftop garden, a fitness center, and a cafeteria.\n\n## Affiliations and community involvement\n\nSVB was a member of the Federal Reserve System and was subject to regulation by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). The bank was also a member of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, a non-profit organization that represented the interests of the Silicon Valley business community.\n\nSVB was committed to giving back to the community and was involved in a range of philanthropic efforts. The bank provided financial support to a number of non-profit organizations, including the Boys and Girls Clubs of America and the United Way.\n\n# Collapse\n\nOn March 10, 2023, SVB announced that it had suffered a significant loss due to the collapse of the tech industry. The bank had invested heavily in the bonds of Silicon Valley startups, which were now facing financial difficulties due to the economic downturn.\n\nIn an effort to shore up its finances, SVB sold a significant portion of its bond portfolio, which resulted in a loss of $1.8 billion. The bank's management team attempted to raise capital to cover the losses, but was ultimately unable to do so.\n\nOn March 10, 2023, the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) closed SVB and appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) as receiver. The FDIC took over the bank's assets and assumed responsibility for winding down SVB's operations.\n\nThe collapse of SVB sent shockwaves through the financial industry and had significant implications for the tech industry as a whole. The bank's failure highlighted the risks associated with the tech industry and the need for greater regulatory oversight.\n\n# References\n\n## Works cited\n\n* \"Silicon Valley Bank Announces Record Earnings for 2022.\" Silicon Valley Bank, 2023.\n* \"SVB Financial Group Announces Completion of Acquisition of Boulder Valley Bank.\" Silicon Valley Bank, 2008.\n* \"SVB Financial Group Announces Record Earnings for 2020.\" Silicon Valley Bank, 2021.\n\n# Further reading\n\n* \"The Rise and Fall of Silicon Valley Bank.\" The New York Times, 2023.\n* \"SVB Collapse: What It Means for the Tech Industry.\" Bloomberg, 2023.\n* \"The SVB Saga: A Cautionary Tale for the Tech Industry.\" Forbes, 2023.\n\n# External links\n\n* Silicon Valley Bank\n* Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\n* California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The team is controlled by the Iran Football Federation, which is a member of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) and the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA).\n\n**History**\n\n### Early years\n\nThe Iran national football team was established in 1926, and it has a long and storied history in international football. The team's early years were marked by a series of losses to European teams, including a 12-1 defeat to Hungary in 1954. However, the team began to show signs of improvement in the 1960s, with a notable victory over Egypt in 1966.\n\n### After the Iranian Revolution\n\nFollowing the Iranian Revolution in 1979, the team's fortunes changed dramatically. The new Islamic government imposed strict rules on the team, including the requirement that players wear long hair and beards. The team's performance on the field also improved, with a notable victory over Australia in 1982.\n\n### 1998–2006\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, the team experienced a period of significant improvement, with a notable appearance in the 2006 FIFA World Cup. The team was led by coach Branko Ivankovic, who implemented a new playing style that emphasized possession football. The team's success was marked by a series of victories over top-ranked teams, including a 2-1 win over Portugal.\n\n### Temporary suspension\n\nIn 2006, the team was temporarily suspended from international competition due to a dispute between the Iran Football Federation and FIFA. The dispute centered on the federation's decision to raise the age limit for players from 23 to 24, which was not in line with FIFA's rules. The suspension lasted for several months, during which time the team was unable to compete in any international matches.\n\n### 2007–14\n\nIn 2007, the team returned to international competition and began to show signs of improvement. The team was led by coach Afshin Ghotbi, who implemented a new playing style that emphasized speed and agility. The team's performance was marked by a series of victories over top-ranked teams, including a 2-1 win over South Korea.\n\n### Late 2010s\n\nIn the late 2010s, the team experienced a period of significant improvement, with a notable appearance in the 2018 FIFA World Cup. The team was led by coach Carlos Queiroz, who implemented a new playing style that emphasized possession football. The team's success was marked by a series of victories over top-ranked teams, including a 1-0 win over Morocco.\n\n### Early 2020s\n\nIn the early 2020s, the team continued to show signs of improvement, with a notable appearance in the 2022 FIFA World Cup. The team was led by coach Dragan Skocic, who implemented a new playing style that emphasized speed and agility. The team's performance was marked by a series of victories over top-ranked teams, including a 1-0 win over England.\n\n**Team image**\n\n### Nicknames\n\nThe Iran national football team is commonly known as the \"Team Melli\", which is the Persian name for the team. The team is also known as the \"Azadegan\" due to its association with the Azadegan League, which is the top division of Iranian football.\n\n### Kits and crests\n\nThe team's kits and crests are designed by the manufacturer Adidas. The team's home kit is a red shirt with white shorts and socks, while the away kit is a blue shirt with white shorts and socks.\n\n### Kit suppliers\n\nThe team's kits are supplied by Adidas.\n\n###

This phenomenon was a result of the widespread cultural and linguistic exchange between ancient Greece and the various civilizations of Africa, particularly in Egypt, Ethiopia, Libya, and Nubia.\n\nAncient Egypt\n\n### First Historical Colonies\n\nThe earliest recorded Greek colonies in Africa were established in the region of Cyrenaica, which is now modern-day Libya. The Greek city of Cyrene, founded in 631 BC by the Phoenicians, was a major center of Greek culture and learning in the Mediterranean. The city's strategic location and rich resources made it an attractive hub for trade and cultural exchange with neighboring African civilizations.\n\n### Hellenistic Times\n\n#### Rule of Alexander the Great (332–323 BC)\n\nThe conquests of Alexander the Great in the 4th century BC had a profound impact on the African continent. Alexander's armies swept through Egypt, Ethiopia, and Libya, spreading Greek culture, language, and ideas throughout the region. Many Africans were exposed to Greek philosophy, art, and architecture, which had a lasting impact on their own cultural development.\n\n#### The Ptolemaic Empire (323–30 BC)\n\nFollowing Alexander's death, his general Ptolemy I Soter established the Ptolemaic Empire in Egypt. The Ptolemies, who were Macedonian Greeks, ruled Egypt for over three centuries, during which time they promoted Greek culture and language throughout the kingdom. Many Africans, including nobles and intellectuals, were educated in Greek schools and adopted Greek customs and traditions.\n\nRoman and Byzantine Egypt\n\n### Coptic Greeks\n\nDuring the Roman and Byzantine periods, Greek culture continued to flourish in Egypt. The Coptic Greeks, who were descendants of the ancient Greeks, played a significant role in shaping Egyptian culture and society. Many Coptic Greeks were influential in the fields of art, literature, and philosophy, and their contributions had a lasting impact on the development of Egyptian civilization.\n\nAncient Ethiopia\n\n### Axumites of Ethiopia\n\nThe Axumite Empire, which flourished from the 1st century BC to the 8th century AD, was a powerful and influential African civilization. The Axumites, who were of Cushitic and Semitic origins, were heavily influenced by Greek culture and language. Many Axumite monarchs and nobles were educated in Greek schools and adopted Greek customs and traditions.\n\n### Abyssinian Greeks\n\nThe Abyssinian Greeks, who were a group of Greeks who settled in Ethiopia during the medieval period, played a significant role in shaping Ethiopian culture and society. Many Abyssinian Greeks were influential in the fields of art, literature, and philosophy, and their contributions had a lasting impact on the development of Ethiopian civilization.\n\nAncient Libya\n\n### Libyan Greeks of Cyrenaica\n\nThe Libyan Greeks of Cyrenaica, who were descendants of the ancient Greeks, continued to play a significant role in shaping Libyan culture and society. Many Libyan Greeks were influential in the fields of art, literature, and philosophy, and their contributions had a lasting impact on the development of Libyan civilization.\n\n### Libyan Greek Culture\n\nLibyan Greek culture, which was shaped by the interactions between the Greeks and the indigenous Libyans, was a unique and vibrant blend of Greek and African traditions. Many Libyan Greeks were skilled in the arts, and their works of art and architecture had a lasting impact on the development of Libyan culture.\n\nAncient Nubia\n\n### Axumite Subjugation of Nubia\n\nThe Axumite Empire, which flourished from the 1st century BC to the 8th century AD, extended its reach into Nubia, a region in northeastern Africa. The Axumites, who were of Cushitic and Semitic origins, were heavily influenced by Greek culture and language. Many Axumite monarchs and nobles were educated in Greek schools and adopted Greek customs and traditions.\n\n### Nubian Greeks\n\nThe Nubian Greeks, who were a group of Greeks who settled in Nubia during the medieval period, played a significant role in shaping Nubian culture and society. Many Nubian Greeks were influential in the fields of art, literature, and philosophy, and their contributions had a lasting impact on the development of Nubian civilization.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe phenomenon of African Greeks, who were individuals of African descent who were influenced by and adopted aspects of ancient Greek culture, language, and traditions, was a significant aspect of the cultural and linguistic exchange between ancient Greece and the various civilizations of Africa. The African Greeks played a significant role in shaping the cultures and societies of Egypt, Ethiopia, Libya, and Nubia, and their contributions had a lasting impact on the development of African civilization.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

While the judiciary has played a crucial role in shaping the nation's laws and policies, the mortality rates among federal judges have been relatively low. Despite this, there have been instances where judges have died in office, often due to various circumstances such as accidents, illnesses, or assassinations. This article provides an overview of the deaths of United States federal judges in active service, including the historical context, political and logistical consequences, and a comprehensive list of judges who have died in office.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe United States federal judiciary is composed of a hierarchical structure, with the Supreme Court at the top, followed by the Courts of Appeals, District Courts, and Bankruptcy Courts. The federal judiciary has a total of over 1,200 active judges, with the majority serving in the District Courts. The judges of the federal judiciary are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, and they serve for life, subject to impeachment and removal.\n\nThe deaths of federal judges in active service have been relatively rare, with most judges serving out their full terms or retiring before passing away. However, there have been instances where judges have died in office, often due to unforeseen circumstances. These events have had significant impacts on the federal judiciary, the court system, and the broader society.\n\n**Political consequences**\n\nThe deaths of federal judges in active service have significant political consequences, both in terms of the impact on the court and the broader society. When a judge dies in office, it often creates a vacancy that must be filled by the President and confirmed by the Senate. This process can be contentious, particularly if the deceased judge was a member of a minority group or had a significant impact on the court's jurisprudence.\n\nThe death of a federal judge can also have a significant impact on the court's decision-making process. If a judge dies in office, their seat may remain vacant for an extended period, potentially disrupting the court's ability to hear and decide cases. In some cases, the court may be unable to reach a quorum, leading to delays and inefficiencies in the judicial process.\n\n**Logistical consequences**\n\nThe deaths of federal judges in active service also have significant logistical consequences. When a judge dies in office, their chambers and staff must be reorganized to accommodate the new judge.

The project has since been repeated on various occasions, with its most recent iteration taking place in 2023. This article provides an overview of the project's history, media response, and notable aspects.\n\n## Overview\n\nR/place is a user-generated, grid-based canvas that allows participants to contribute to a collaborative artwork by adding or removing pixels. The project is often referred to as a \"social experiment\" due to its ability to bring together individuals from diverse backgrounds and showcase the power of collective creativity.\n\n## History\n\nR/place has undergone several iterations since its inception in 2017. Each iteration has introduced new features and gameplay mechanics, but the core concept remains the same.\n\n### 2017 experiment\n\nThe first R/place experiment took place on 4chan's /x/ board in April 2017. The project was created by 4chan users, who were given a 100x100 pixel grid to work with. Participants were allowed to add or remove pixels to create a collaborative artwork. The project quickly gained popularity, with users from around the world contributing to the artwork. The resulting image was a vibrant, abstract piece that showcased the diversity of the 4chan community.\n\nThe 2017 experiment was notable for its ability to bring together individuals from different parts of the world. Participants from countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia worked together to create a cohesive artwork. The project also highlighted the power of collective creativity, as users from different backgrounds came together to create something unique.\n\n### 2022 experiment\n\nThe second R/place experiment took place on 4chan's /x/ board in April 2022. This iteration introduced several new features, including a larger grid size (500x500 pixels) and a more complex gameplay mechanic. Participants were allowed to add or remove pixels, as well as draw lines and shapes using a variety of colors. The project also introduced a new concept called \"tiles,\" which allowed users to create larger, more complex artworks by combining smaller tiles.\n\nThe 2022 experiment was notable for its ability to showcase the diversity of the 4chan community. Participants from around the world contributed to the artwork, creating a vibrant and abstract piece that reflected the unique characteristics of the 4chan community.

In modern display technology, resolution is a critical factor in determining the quality and clarity of images displayed on a device. This article provides an overview of various display resolution standards, including high-definition, video graphics array, and extended graphics array resolutions.\n\n**Overview**\n\nDisplay resolution standards have evolved over the years, with each new standard offering improved image quality and resolution. The early display standards, such as VGA and SVGA, were initially used in computer monitors and televisions. As technology advanced, new standards like XGA, SXGA, and UXGA emerged, offering higher resolutions and wider color gamuts. Today, we have high-definition (HD), full high-definition (FHD), ultra-wide full high-definition (UWFHD), and 4K ultra-high-definition (UHD) resolutions, among others.\n\n**Aspect Ratio**\n\nThe aspect ratio of a display refers to the ratio of its width to its height. Common aspect ratios include 4:3, 16:9, and 16:10. The aspect ratio affects how images are displayed on a screen, with wider aspect ratios offering a more cinematic experience. Many modern displays, such as televisions and computer monitors, offer adjustable aspect ratios to accommodate different content formats.\n\n**High-Definition**\n\nHigh-definition (HD) resolutions offer a significant improvement over standard definition (SD) resolutions.

It is a Class J 4-8-4 steam locomotive, designed for high-speed passenger service on the N&W's mainline. The 611 has become an iconic symbol of American railroading, known for its speed, power, and aesthetic appeal.\n\n# Design and Abilities\n\nThe Norfolk and Western 611 was designed to be a high-speed passenger locomotive, capable of hauling large numbers of passengers at speeds of up to 100 mph (161 km/h). It was built with a 4-8-4 wheel arrangement, featuring a pair of leading wheels, four driving wheels, and four trailing wheels. The locomotive's cylinder valves were designed to be actuated by a single cam, allowing for smooth and efficient operation.\n\nThe 611's boiler was designed to produce high-pressure steam, with a maximum pressure of 250 psi (1,724 kPa). The locomotive's firebox was equipped with a Foster-Wheeler combustion chamber, which provided a high level of combustion efficiency and reduced fuel consumption. The 611's driving wheels were equipped with a type of braking system known as \"dynamic braking,\" which allowed the locomotive to slow down by converting some of its kinetic energy into heat.\n\n## Performance and Capabilities\n\nThe Norfolk and Western 611 was capable of producing a maximum tractive effort of 45,000 pounds (20,412 kg), making it one of the most powerful steam locomotives in the world at the time of its construction. The locomotive's top speed was 100 mph (161 km/h), with an average speed of 80-90 mph (129-145 km/h) over long distances. The 611's fuel consumption was approximately 300 pounds (136 kg) of coal per hour, making it relatively efficient for its size and power output.\n\n# History\n\nThe Norfolk and Western 611 was built in 1950 at the Roanoke Shops of the Norfolk and Western Railway in Roanoke, Virginia. It was one of 14 Class J 4-8-4 steam locomotives built by the N&W, and was designed to haul high-speed passenger trains over the N&W's mainline.\n\n## Revenue Service\n\nThe Norfolk and Western 611 entered revenue service on October 1, 1950, and quickly became a popular choice for hauling high-speed passenger trains on the N&W's mainline. The locomotive was known for its speed, power, and reliability, and quickly became a favorite among passengers and railroad employees alike.\n\n## First Retirement\n\nThe Norfolk and Western 611 was retired from revenue service in 1964, after 14 years of service. The locomotive was stored in the N&W's Roanoke Shops, where it remained in storage for several years.\n\n## First Mainline Excursion Service\n\nIn 1965, the 611 was restored to operating condition and began its first mainline excursion service. The locomotive was used to haul passenger trains over the N&W's mainline, offering excursion rides to tourists and railfans. The 611 quickly became a popular attraction, and its excursion service quickly became a highlight of the N&W's operations.\n\n## Second Retirement\n\nThe Norfolk and Western 611 was retired from mainline excursion service in 1975, after 10 years of service. The locomotive was stored in the N&W's Roanoke Shops, where it remained in storage for several years.\n\n## Second Mainline Excursion Service\n\nIn 1981, the 611 was restored to operating condition and began its second mainline excursion service. The locomotive was used to haul passenger trains over the N&W's mainline, offering excursion rides to tourists and railfans. The 611 quickly became a popular attraction, and its excursion service quickly became a highlight of the N&W's operations.\n\n## Post-NS Excursion Service\n\nIn 1982, the Norfolk and Western Railway was merged with the Southern Railway to form the Norfolk Southern Railway (NS). The 611 continued to operate in excursion service, offering passenger trains over the NS's mainline. The locomotive remained in service until 1997, when it was retired from excursion service due to the increasing costs of maintaining the locomotive.\n\n# Accidents and Incidents\n\nThe Norfolk and Western 611 has been involved in several accidents and incidents throughout its service life. In 1952, the locomotive was involved in a collision with a freight train, resulting in minor damage to the locomotive. In 1967, the 611 was involved in a derailment, resulting in significant damage to the locomotive.\n\n# In Popular Culture\n\nThe Norfolk and Western 611 has been featured in several films and television shows, including \"The Great Locomotive Chase\" and \"The Cannonball Run.\" The locomotive has also been featured in several books and magazines, including \"Trains\" and \"Railroad Magazine.\"\n\n# See Also\n\n* List of Norfolk and Western Railway locomotives\n* Class J 4-8-4 steam locomotive\n* Norfolk and Western Railway\n* Norfolk Southern Railway\n\n# Notes\n\n* The Norfolk and Western 611 is one of the most historic and iconic steam locomotives in the world.\n* The locomotive has been in service for over 60 years, making it one of the longest-serving steam locomotives in the world.\n* The 611 has been operated by several railroads, including the Norfolk and Western Railway and the Norfolk Southern Railway.\n\n# References\n\n* [insert references]\n\n# Bibliography\n\n* \"The Norfolk and Western 611\" by Robert C.

The protests drew international attention and highlighted the country's strained relationship with the United States.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe protests were sparked by the Canadian government's implementation of vaccine mandates for truckers crossing the border from the United States. The mandates, introduced in January 2022, required drivers to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 in order to continue crossing the border. The move was part of the country's efforts to slow the spread of the virus and protect public health.\n\n**Protest Goals**\n\nThe primary goal of the protests was to lift the vaccine mandates and passports, which protesters believed were an overreach of government authority and an infringement on their personal freedoms. The protesters also sought to raise awareness about the economic and social impacts of the mandates on truckers and other affected individuals.\n\n**Initial Events and the Start of the Protest**\n\nThe protests began in late January 2022, when a group of truckers launched a fundraising campaign on social media to support their efforts to overturn the vaccine mandates. The campaign, which was initially met with skepticism by many in the media and government, quickly gained traction and raised millions of dollars in donations.\n\n**American Influence**\n\nThe protests were heavily influenced by American truckers and conservative groups, who saw the Canadian government's vaccine mandates as an attack on personal freedom and a threat to the trucking industry. Many American truckers and politicians expressed support for the Canadian protesters, seeing the issue as a broader battle against government overreach and vaccine mandates.\n\n**Fundraising**\n\nThe fundraising campaign was a key factor in the success of the protests. The campaign, which was led by a group of Canadian and American truckers, raised millions of dollars in donations from individuals and businesses across North America. The funds were used to support the protests, including fuel, food, and other expenses for the truckers.\n\n**Donor List Hacked**\n\nIn February 2022, it was reported that the donor list for the fundraising campaign had been hacked and made public. The list, which included the names and contact information of thousands of donors, was widely shared on social media and sparked concerns about the safety and security of the donors.\n\n**Vaccine Mandates and Passports**\n\nThe vaccine mandates and passports were a key focus of the protests. The Canadian government introduced the mandates in January 2022, requiring truckers and other individuals to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 in order to continue crossing the border. The move was part of the country's efforts to slow the spread of the virus and protect public health.\n\n**Vaccination Requirements for US–Canada Cross-Border Travel**\n\nThe vaccination requirements for cross-border travel were a key issue for the protests. Many truckers and other individuals were opposed to the mandates, which they saw as an overreach of government authority and an infringement on their personal freedoms. The protests drew attention to the issue and sparked a broader debate about the role of government in regulating public health.\n\n**Convoy to Ottawa**\n\nIn early February 2022, a convoy of trucks set out from British Columbia, bound for Ottawa, the capital city of Canada. The convoy, which included hundreds of trucks and thousands of supporters, was a key part of the protests and drew international attention.\n\n**Ottawa Protest**\n\nThe Ottawa protest was a key part of the convoy's journey. The protest, which took place on Parliament Hill, drew thousands of supporters and sparked a series of clashes with police. The protest was marked by the burning of a Canadian flag and the desecration of public property.\n\n**Peak Size of Parliament Hill Demonstration**\n\nThe peak size of the Parliament Hill demonstration was estimated to be around 10,000 people. The event was marked by a series of speeches and performances, as well as a confrontation with police.\n\n**Desecration and Community Harassment**\n\nThe Ottawa protest was marked by a series of incidents of desecration and community harassment. The most notable incident was the burning of a Canadian flag, which sparked widespread condemnation.\n\n**Ottawa Protests and Entrenchment**\n\nThe Ottawa protests drew attention to the issue of vaccine mandates and passports, and sparked a broader debate about the role of government in regulating public health.
