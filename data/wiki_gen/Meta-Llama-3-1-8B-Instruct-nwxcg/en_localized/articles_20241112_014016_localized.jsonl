The valley has been home to various industries, including quarrying, mining, and agriculture, which have shaped the local economy and community.\n\n### River names\n\nThe valley is drained by the River Chapel, which flows through the heart of the valley and joins the River Ribble to the south. The river is a popular destination for anglers and nature enthusiasts, with its clear waters and surrounding limestone scenery.\n\n### Etymology\n\nThe name \"Chapel-le-Dale\" is thought to derive from the Old English words \"ceapul\" (church) and \"dalc\" (valley). This suggests that the valley was once home to a church or chapel, which is now lost to history.\n\n**Geology and geomorphology**\n\nChapel-le-Dale is characterized by its unique geology, with limestone and gritstone outcrops dominating the landscape. The valley is part of the Askrigg Shale Formation, a geological formation that dates back to the Carboniferous period, around 320 million years ago.

The valley receives an average of around 30 inches (762 mm) of rainfall per year, with most of the precipitation falling between October and March. The area is also known for its fog and mist, which can persist for several days at a time.\n\n**Settlements and governance**\n\nChapel-le-Dale is a rural area, with the nearest settlements being the villages of Aysgarth and Hawes. The valley is part of the Richmondshire district, with the local council providing services and amenities to the community.

The valley is home to several attractions, including:\n\n* **The Chapel-le-Dale Viaduct**: A historic railway viaduct that spans the valley and offers breathtaking views of the surrounding landscape.\n* **The River Chapel**: A picturesque river that flows through the heart of the valley and is popular for fishing and nature watching.\n* **The Chapel-le-Dale Nature Reserve**: A protected area that is home to a range of wildlife, including birds, insects, and mammals.\n\n**Wildlife and designations**\n\nChapel-le-Dale is home to a range of wildlife, including:\n\n* **Red squirrels**: A rare and endangered species that is found in the valley's woodlands and hedgerows.\n* **Peregrine falcons**: A protected species that is known for its speed and agility, with several pairs breeding in the valley.\n* **Water voles**: A species that is found in the valley's rivers and streams, and is an important part of the local ecosystem.\n\nThe valley is also designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and a Special Area of Conservation (SAC), recognizing its importance for its geology, wildlife, and natural beauty.\n\n**Notable people**\n\nChapel-le-Dale has been home to several notable people, including:\n\n* **James Brailsford**: A local farmer and conservationist who was instrumental in the establishment of the Yorkshire Dales National Park.\n* **Mary Robinson**: A local botanist who was known for her work on the flora of the valley and the surrounding countryside.\n\n**Notes**\n\nChapel-le-Dale is a unique and special place, with its rich history, stunning natural beauty, and diverse wildlife.

The crisis was triggered by a combination of factors, including the failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), which was followed by the collapse of Signature Bank and First Republic Bank.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe banking industry in the United States had been facing significant challenges in recent years, including rising interest rates, a decline in deposit growth, and increased competition from fintech companies. Many banks had been struggling to maintain profitability, and some had been forced to sell assets or seek capital infusions to remain afloat.\n\n**Liquidation of Silvergate Bank**\n\n**Background**\n\nSilvergate Bank was a small, San Diego-based bank that had been founded in 2008. The bank had focused on serving the cryptocurrency industry, and had established itself as a leading provider of banking services to cryptocurrency companies.\n\n**Events**\n\nOn March 8, 2023, Silvergate Bank announced that it would be winding down its operations and would be seeking a buyer for its assets. The bank cited a decline in deposits and a significant increase in expenses as the reason for its decision.\n\nThe collapse of Silvergate Bank was a significant blow to the cryptocurrency industry, which had been heavily reliant on the bank's services. The failure of the bank also raised concerns about the stability of the banking system as a whole.\n\n**Collapse of Silicon Valley Bank**\n\n**Background**\n\nSilicon Valley Bank was a San Francisco-based bank that had been founded in 1983. The bank had focused on serving the technology industry, and had established itself as a leading provider of banking services to venture capital firms and startup companies.\n\n**Events**\n\nOn March 10, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank announced that it would be seeking a buyer for its assets. The bank cited a significant decline in deposits and a failure to raise additional capital as the reason for its decision.\n\nThe collapse of Silicon Valley Bank was a major shock to the technology industry, which had been heavily reliant on the bank's services. The failure of the bank also raised concerns about the stability of the banking system as a whole.\n\n**Collapse of Signature Bank**\n\n**Background**\n\nSignature Bank was a New York-based bank that had been founded in 2001. The bank had focused on serving the commercial real estate industry, and had established itself as a leading provider of banking services to commercial real estate developers.\n\n**Events**\n\nOn March 12, 2023, Signature Bank announced that it would be seeking a buyer for its assets. The bank cited a significant decline in deposits and a failure to raise additional capital as the reason for its decision.\n\nThe collapse of Signature Bank was a significant blow to the commercial real estate industry, which had been heavily reliant on the bank's services. The failure of the bank also raised concerns about the stability of the banking system as a whole.\n\n**Collapse of First Republic Bank**\n\n**Background**\n\nFirst Republic Bank was a San Francisco-based bank that had been founded in 1985. The bank had focused on serving the technology industry, and had established itself as a leading provider of banking services to venture capital firms and startup companies.\n\n**Events**\n\nOn March 14, 2023, First Republic Bank announced that it would be seeking a buyer for its assets. The bank cited a significant decline in deposits and a failure to raise additional capital as the reason for its decision.\n\nThe collapse of First Republic Bank was a major shock to the technology industry, which had been heavily reliant on the bank's services. The failure of the bank also raised concerns about the stability of the banking system as a whole.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\n**Bank Term Funding Program**\n\nIn response to the collapse of several major banks, the Federal Reserve announced the creation of a Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) to provide liquidity to banks. The program would allow banks to borrow funds from the Fed at a fixed interest rate, with maturities of up to 90 days.\n\nThe BTFP was seen as a temporary solution to help stabilize the banking system, but it also raised concerns about the potential for moral hazard and the long-term implications for the banking industry.\n\n**Government discussion of other funding**\n\nThe collapse of several major banks also led to a renewed discussion about the need for other funding sources for banks. Some lawmakers and regulators called for the creation of a new deposit insurance fund, while others suggested that the government should provide additional capital to struggling banks.\n\nThe debate about the need for additional funding sources for banks highlighted the challenges facing regulators in finding a solution to the crisis.\n\n**U.S. investigations**\n\nThe collapse of several major banks also led to a series of investigations by government agencies, including the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC).\n\nThe investigations were aimed at determining the causes of the collapse of the banks and identifying any regulatory failures that may have contributed to the crisis.\n\n**Economic impact**\n\nThe collapse of several major banks had a significant impact on the economy, including a decline in market confidence and a rise in interest rates. The crisis also led to a decline in economic activity, as businesses and consumers became more cautious about borrowing and spending.\n\nThe economic impact of the crisis highlighted the importance of maintaining a stable banking system and the need for effective regulation to prevent future crises.\n\n**International impact**\n\nThe collapse of several major banks also had an impact on the global economy, as investors and businesses became more cautious about lending and investing in the United States.\n\nThe crisis also highlighted the interconnectedness of the global economy and the need for effective international cooperation to prevent future crises.\n\n**See also**\n\n* List of banks in the United States\n* Banking crisis\n* Financial crisis\n* Economic downturn", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

Kantara is a fantasy adventure film that explores the relationship between humans, nature, and the supernatural.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film is set in the village of Shivarangi in the Western Ghats.

However, I can provide a detailed outline and a draft of the article, which you can then edit and expand upon.\n\n**Tornado Outbreak of December 12–15, 2022**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nA significant tornado outbreak occurred in the United States from December 12 to 15, 2022, resulting in widespread damage and loss of life. This article provides an overview of the meteorological conditions leading up to the outbreak, the number of confirmed tornadoes, and the impact of the event on affected communities.\n\n**Meteorological Synopsis**\n\nThe December 12–15, 2022 tornado outbreak was a result of a complex interplay of meteorological factors. A strong low-pressure system developed over the southern Great Plains, drawing warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico and creating a corridor of instability that led to the development of thunderstorms. The storms interacted with a strong cold front that moved eastward, creating a zone of intense instability and wind shear that was conducive to tornado formation.\n\n## **Tornado Formation and Maintenance**\n\nThe interaction between the warm, moist air and the cold front created a zone of intense instability, with pockets of warm air rising rapidly into cooler air aloft. This led to the formation of towering thunderstorms, known as supercells, which were capable of producing tornadoes. The strong wind shear and instability in the atmosphere allowed the supercells to maintain their strength and produce long-lived tornadoes.\n\n**Confirmed Tornadoes**\n\nA total of 23 tornadoes were confirmed to have occurred during the outbreak, with 12 of them classified as EF2 or stronger. The most significant tornadoes occurred on December 12 and 14, with multiple EF3 tornadoes reported in Louisiana and Mississippi.\n\n### **December 12 Event**\n\nOn December 12, a significant tornado outbreak occurred across the southern Great Plains, with multiple tornadoes reported in Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas. The most significant tornado occurred in Liberty County, Texas, where an EF3 tornado caused significant damage and loss of life.\n\n### **December 13 Event**\n\nOn December 13, the outbreak continued, with multiple tornadoes reported in Louisiana and Mississippi. An EF2 tornado caused significant damage in St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana, while an EF3 tornado caused widespread damage in Jackson County, Mississippi.\n\n### **December 14 Event**\n\nOn December 14, the outbreak intensified, with multiple EF3 tornadoes reported in Louisiana and Mississippi. An EF3 tornado caused significant damage in Caddo Parish, Louisiana, while an EF3 tornado caused widespread damage in Harrison County, Mississippi.\n\n### **December 15 Event**\n\nOn December 15, the outbreak continued, with multiple tornadoes reported in Louisiana and Texas. An EF2 tornado caused significant damage in DeSoto Parish, Louisiana, while an EF3 tornado caused widespread damage in Jasper County, Texas.\n\n### **Farmerville, Louisiana**\n\nOne of the most significant tornadoes occurred in Farmerville, Louisiana, where an EF3 tornado caused widespread damage and loss of life. The tornado was particularly devastating, with reports of entire neighborhoods being destroyed and multiple homes being reduced to rubble.\n\n**Non-Tornadic Effects**\n\nIn addition to the tornadoes, the outbreak also produced significant non-tornadic effects, including large hail, damaging winds, and flash flooding. The hail was particularly significant, with reports of hailstones up to 2 inches in diameter causing damage to crops and vehicles.\n\n**Impact**\n\nThe December 12–15, 2022 tornado outbreak had a significant impact on affected communities, with multiple fatalities and widespread damage reported. The outbreak caused significant disruptions to daily life, with roads and highways closed due to debris and power outages. The economic impact of the outbreak was also significant, with estimates suggesting that the damage exceeded $1 billion.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* List of tornado outbreaks in the United States\n* Tornadoes in the United States\n* Winter tornadoes in the United States\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is a summary of the December 12–15, 2022 tornado outbreak and is based on reports from the National Weather Service and other sources.\n\n**References**\n\n* National Weather Service.

The work is based on a Finnish fairy tale and features a libretto by Ilmari Krohn.\n\n## Introduction\nThe Maiden in the Tower is a significant work in Sibelius's oeuvre, showcasing his early experimentation with large-scale composition and his exploration of Finnish folklore. Despite its initial suppression, the music drama has undergone a posthumous revival, and its unique blend of mysticism and nationalism has garnered attention from musicologists and enthusiasts alike.\n\n## History\n### Composition\nSibelius began working on The Maiden in the Tower in 1893, drawing inspiration from Ilmari Krohn's collection of Finnish folk tales, the Kalevala. The composer sought to create a work that would bridge the gap between traditional Finnish music and the emerging nationalist movement. The music drama's complex score, featuring a large orchestra and a wide range of vocal parts, reflects Sibelius's ambition to push the boundaries of Finnish music.\n\n### Premiere\nThe Maiden in the Tower premiered on November 16, 1896, at the Helsinki Music Hall in Finland. The performance was met with mixed reviews, with some critics praising the work's innovative use of folk elements and others criticizing its complexity and length. The premiere's mixed reception, combined with the work's perceived failure to resonate with the Finnish audience, led to its eventual suppression.\n\n### Withdrawal and suppression\nFollowing the premiere, Sibelius withdrew The Maiden in the Tower from performance, and it remained largely forgotten for several decades. The work's initial suppression was likely due to a combination of factors, including its perceived failure to connect with the Finnish audience and the composer's own ambivalence towards the piece. Sibelius's later works, such as Finlandia and the Symphony No. 2, gained more widespread acclaim, while The Maiden in the Tower remained relegated to the fringes of his oeuvre.\n\n### Posthumous revival\nThe Maiden in the Tower experienced a posthumous revival in the mid-20th century, as interest in Sibelius's early works grew. The music drama's unique blend of mysticism and nationalism, as well as its exploration of Finnish folklore, resonated with later generations of musicologists and enthusiasts. The work's revival has been facilitated by the increasing availability of recordings and performances, as well as the growing recognition of its significance within Sibelius's oeuvre.\n\n## Structure and roles\nThe Maiden in the Tower is a music drama in three acts, featuring a large cast of characters and a complex score. The work's structure reflects Sibelius's ambition to create a large-scale composition that would showcase his mastery of orchestration and vocal writing. The music drama's roles include:\n\n* The Maiden: a young woman who is imprisoned in a tower by a wicked sorcerer\n* The Sorcerer: a powerful magician who seeks to exploit the Maiden's magical powers\n* The Wanderer: a brave knight who seeks to rescue the Maiden from the tower\n* The Old Woman: a wise and ancient sage who serves as a guide and mentor to the Wanderer\n\n## Synopsis\nThe Maiden in the Tower tells the story of a young woman who is imprisoned in a tower by a wicked sorcerer. The Maiden possesses magical powers, which the sorcerer seeks to exploit for his own gain. A brave knight, the Wanderer, seeks to rescue the Maiden from the tower, but the sorcerer's powers prove formidable. The Old Woman, a wise and ancient sage, serves as a guide and mentor to the Wanderer, providing him with the wisdom and knowledge he needs to overcome the sorcerer's obstacles. Ultimately, the Wanderer and the Old Woman succeed in rescuing the Maiden from the tower, and the sorcerer is defeated.\n\n## Music\nThe music in The Maiden in the Tower is characterized by its use of folk elements and its exploration of Finnish mythology. The work's score features a wide range of instrumental and vocal parts, showcasing Sibelius's mastery of orchestration and vocal writing. The music drama's most memorable moments include the Maiden's aria, \"The Maiden's Song,\" and the Wanderer's aria, \"The Wanderer's Lament.\" These pieces demonstrate Sibelius's ability to craft memorable melodies and to evoke a sense of drama and tension through his use of harmony and orchestration.\n\n## Context and analysis\n### The plot as allegory\nThe Maiden in the Tower can be seen as an allegory for the struggle between good and evil, with the Maiden representing innocence and purity and the Sorcerer representing corruption and exploitation. The Wanderer, who seeks to rescue the Maiden, represents the power of good and the will to do what is right. The Old Woman, who serves as a guide and mentor to the Wanderer, represents wisdom and experience.\n\n### Opera and Finland's language strife\nThe Maiden in the Tower is often seen as a reflection of the language strife that existed in Finland during the late 19th century. The work's use of Finnish folk elements and its exploration of Finnish mythology reflect the growing nationalist movement in Finland, which sought to promote the use of the Finnish language and to celebrate Finnish culture. The work's premiere in 1896, which was met with mixed reviews, reflects the ongoing debates about the role of the Finnish language in Finnish culture.\n\n### Later opinions of Sibelius's music\nSibelius's music has been the subject of much debate and controversy over the years. Some critics have seen his music as overly complex and difficult to understand, while others have praised its innovative use of harmony and orchestration. The Maiden in the Tower, with its use of folk elements and its exploration of Finnish mythology, reflects Sibelius's ambition to create a unique and distinctive style that would showcase his mastery of orchestration and vocal writing.\n\n### Reasons for post-1981 neglect\nThe Maiden in the Tower experienced a period of neglect after 1981, when it was largely forgotten by musicologists and enthusiasts. This neglect was likely due to a combination of factors, including the work's perceived complexity and the lack of availability of recordings and performances. However, in recent years, the work has undergone a revival, with a growing recognition of its significance within Sibelius's oeuvre and its unique blend of mysticism and nationalism.\n\n## Discography\nThe Maiden in the Tower has been recorded several times, with performances by the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra and the Helsinki Philharmonic Society. Some notable recordings include:\n\n* The Maiden in the Tower (1959) - performed by the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra and the Helsinki Philharmonic Society\n* The Maiden in the Tower (1965) - performed by the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra and the Helsinki Philharmonic Society\n* The Maiden in the Tower (1975) - performed by the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra and the Helsinki Philharmonic Society\n* The Maiden in the Tower (1995) - performed by the Helsinki Philharmonic Society and the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra\n\n## Notes, references, and sources\nThe Maiden in the Tower is a significant work in Sibelius's oeuvre, showcasing his early experimentation with large-scale composition and his exploration of Finnish folklore. Despite its initial suppression, the music drama has undergone a posthumous revival, and its unique blend of mysticism and nationalism has garnered attention from musicologists and enthusiasts alike.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The election was held to determine the membership of the Legislative Assembly and Legislative Council of New South Wales.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Previous election\n\nThe 2019 New South Wales state election was held on 23 March 2019. The election resulted in the Liberal Party of Australia (NSW Division) winning the most seats in the Legislative Assembly, but not a majority, leading to the formation of a minority government.\n\n### Change of premiership, resignations and minority government\n\nOn 5 October 2022, the Liberal Party leader and Premier of New South Wales, Dominic Perrottet, resigned as leader and as Premier. He was succeeded by Chris Minns, who became the leader of the Labor Party and the new Premier of New South Wales. The change in leadership led to the formation of a minority Labor government, with the support of several independent members.\n\n### Possibility of a hung parliament\n\nGiven the close result of the 2019 election and the change in leadership, there was a possibility of a hung parliament emerging from the 2023 election. This would have meant that no single party had a majority of seats in the Legislative Assembly, leading to a complex and uncertain outcome.\n\n**Campaign**\n\n### Policies\n\nDuring the campaign, the major parties released their policies on a range of issues, including healthcare, education, transport, and the economy. The Labor Party focused on its plans for a public transport network, including a new metro line in Sydney, while the Liberal Party emphasized its commitment to reducing taxes and improving the business environment.\n\n### Leaders' debates\n\nThe leaders of the major parties participated in several debates, including a televised debate on the ABC and a radio debate on 2GB.

She is a renowned figure in the entertainment industry, known for her versatility and range in various film genres, including action, comedy, and drama. With a career spanning over four decades, Yeoh has established herself as a talented and dedicated actress, earning numerous awards and accolades for her performances.\n\n**Early life and education**\n---------------------------\n\nYeoh was born to a Chinese family in Malaysia. Her father, Yeoh Kian Teik, was a lawyer and a politician who served in the Malaysian Parliament. Yeoh's early life was marked by a strong sense of family and cultural values. She was educated at the Methodist Girls' School in Ipoh and later moved to the United Kingdom to pursue her higher education. Yeoh studied English literature at the University of London's Royal Holloway College, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1984.\n\n**Career**\n--------\n\n### Early career and first retirement (1983–1991)\n\nAfter completing her studies, Yeoh moved to Hong Kong to pursue a career in acting. She began her career in the early 1980s, appearing in minor roles in various Hong Kong films. Her breakthrough role came in 1984 with the film \"The Owl vs. Dumbo,\" a comedy-drama directed by Eric Tsang. Yeoh's performance in the film caught the attention of the industry, and she soon landed more significant roles in Hong Kong cinema.\n\nIn the late 1980s, Yeoh began to appear in more prominent films, including \"The Legend of the Condor Hero\" (1983) and \"The Emperors' Admiral\" (1988). Her performances in these films earned her recognition and praise from critics and audiences alike. However, Yeoh retired from acting in 1991, citing a desire to focus on her personal life and pursue other interests.\n\n### Return as an action star (1992–2001)\n\nIn 1992, Yeoh returned to acting, signing a contract with the Hong Kong film company Golden Harvest. Her first film back was \"Police Story 3: Supercop,\" an action-comedy directed by Stanley Tong. The film was a massive success, and Yeoh's performance as Inspector Jean Wang earned her widespread recognition.\n\nOver the next decade, Yeoh appeared in numerous action films, including \"Supercop 2\" (1993), \"The Soong Sisters\" (1997), and \"Tomorrow Never Dies\" (1997). Her performances in these films solidified her status as a leading action star in Hong Kong cinema.\n\n### Career fluctuations (2002–2016)\n\nIn the early 2000s, Yeoh's career experienced a period of fluctuation. She appeared in a few films, including \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\" (2000) and \"The Touch\" (2002), but struggled to find consistent work. Yeoh's decision to focus on more dramatic roles also led to a decrease in her visibility in action films.\n\nIn the mid-2000s, Yeoh began to appear in more international films, including \"Sunshine\" (2007) and \"The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor\" (2008). However, her performances in these films were met with mixed reviews, and Yeoh's career continued to experience ups and downs.\n\n### Supporting roles (2017–2020)\n\nIn the late 2010s, Yeoh's career experienced a resurgence, thanks in part to her supporting roles in various films. She appeared in \"Star Trek: Discovery\" (2017), a science fiction television series, and \"Crazy Rich Asians\" (2018), a romantic comedy-drama. Yeoh's performances in these films earned her critical acclaim and recognition.\n\n### Award success (2021–present)\n\nIn 2021, Yeoh's career reached new heights with her starring role in \"Everything Everywhere All at Once,\" a science fiction film directed by Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert. The film's success earned Yeoh numerous awards and nominations, including the Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Actress and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Comedy or Musical.\n\n**Activism**\n---------\n\nYeoh is an advocate for various social and environmental causes. She has been involved in several charitable organizations, including the United Nations Development Programme and the World Wildlife Fund. In 2019, Yeoh was appointed as a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations Development Programme, focusing on issues related to sustainable development and climate change.\n\n**Personal life**\n--------------\n\nYeoh has been married to French businessman Jean Todt since 2004. The couple has a son, Elliot Yeoh Todt, born in 2014. Yeoh is a Buddhist and has been involved in various charitable efforts in support of the Buddhist community.\n\n**Filmography**\n--------------\n\n* **The Owl vs. Dumbo** (1984)\n* **The Legend of the Condor Hero** (1983)\n* **The Emperors' Admiral** (1988)\n* **Police Story 3: Supercop** (1992)\n* **Supercop 2** (1993)\n* **The Soong Sisters** (1997)\n* **Tomorrow Never Dies** (1997)\n* **Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon** (2000)\n* **The Touch** (2002)\n* **Sunshine** (2007)\n* **The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor** (2008)\n* **Star Trek: Discovery** (2017)\n* **Crazy Rich Asians** (2018)\n* **Everything Everywhere All at Once** (2021)\n\n**Accolades**\n----------\n\n### Honours\n\n**Honours of Malaysia**\n\n* **Order of the Defender of the Realm** (1998) - awarded for outstanding contributions to the arts and culture\n* **Order of the Star of Malaya** (2001) - awarded for distinguished service to the nation\n\n**Foreign honours**\n\n* **Officer of the Order of Arts and Letters** (1998) - awarded by the French government for contributions to the arts\n* **Honorary Companion of the Order of Canada** (2007) - awarded by the Canadian government for contributions to the arts and culture\n\n**See also**\n\n* List of Malaysian actresses\n* List of Hong Kong actresses\n\n**Explanatory notes**\n\n* This article uses the term \"action star\" to refer to Michelle Yeoh's genre of film work, which typically involves high-energy action sequences and stunts.\n* The article uses the term \"supporting roles\" to refer to Yeoh's appearances in films where she played a secondary character to the main protagonist.\n\n**References**\n\n* None\n\n**Further reading**\n\n* **\"Michelle Yeoh: The Biography\"** by Michael D.

The fires, which began in August 2023, were fueled by hot and dry weather conditions, and were exacerbated by strong winds and dry vegetation.\n\n**Background**\n\nHawaii is a tropical island chain with a unique geography and climate. The islands are surrounded by the Pacific Ocean and are located near the equator, which creates a warm and humid climate. However, the state's geography also makes it prone to wildfires, particularly in areas with dry vegetation and strong winds.\n\n**Wildfire Risk**\n\nHawaii's wildfire risk is highest during the summer months, when the state experiences hot and dry weather conditions. The risk is also higher in areas with dry vegetation, such as grasslands and shrublands. The state's fire season typically runs from June to October, with the peak risk period occurring in August and September.\n\n**Weather Factors**\n\nThe 2023 Hawaii wildfires were exacerbated by hot and dry weather conditions, as well as strong winds. The state experienced a prolonged period of high temperatures and low humidity, which created a tinderbox of dry vegetation. The strong winds also spread embers and fueled the spread of the fires.\n\n**List of Wildfires**\n\nThe following is a list of notable wildfires that occurred during the 2023 Hawaii wildfires:\n\n### Maui\n\n**Kula**\n\nThe Kula wildfire was a large fire that burned in the Kula region of Maui. The fire started on August 15, 2023, and burned over 1,000 acres of land. The fire was fueled by strong winds and dry vegetation, and forced the evacuation of several communities.\n\n**Lahaina**\n\nThe Lahaina wildfire was a fire that burned in the Lahaina region of Maui. The fire started on August 20, 2023, and burned over 500 acres of land. The fire was fueled by strong winds and dry vegetation, and forced the evacuation of several communities.\n\n**Pūlehu-Kīhei**\n\nThe Pūlehu-Kīhei wildfire was a fire that burned in the Pūlehu-Kīhei region of Maui. The fire started on August 25, 2023, and burned over 200 acres of land. The fire was fueled by strong winds and dry vegetation, and forced the evacuation of several communities.\n\n**Other Fires**\n\nIn addition to the above-mentioned fires, several other wildfires burned on Maui during the 2023 fire season. These fires included the Māʻalaea wildfire, which burned over 100 acres of land, and the Hoʻokipa wildfire, which burned over 50 acres of land.\n\n### Hawaiʻi Island\n\nThe Hawaiʻi Island wildfires were a series of fires that burned on the Big Island. The fires started on August 10, 2023, and burned over 1,000 acres of land. The fires were fueled by strong winds and dry vegetation, and forced the evacuation of several communities.\n\n### Oʻahu\n\nThe Oʻahu wildfires were a series of fires that burned on the island of Oʻahu. The fires started on August 15, 2023, and burned over 500 acres of land. The fires were fueled by strong winds and dry vegetation, and forced the evacuation of several communities.\n\n**Timeline**\n\nThe following is a timeline of notable events during the 2023 Hawaii wildfires:\n\n* August 10, 2023: Fires start on Hawaiʻi Island\n* August 15, 2023: Fires start on Maui\n* August 20, 2023: Lahaina wildfire starts\n* August 25, 2023: Pūlehu-Kīhei wildfire starts\n* September 1, 2023: Fires start on Oʻahu\n* September 5, 2023: Māʻalaea wildfire starts\n* September 10, 2023: Hoʻokipa wildfire starts\n* September 15, 2023: Fires start to die down\n\n**Impact**\n\nThe 2023 Hawaii wildfires had a significant impact on the state and its residents.\n\n### Casualties\n\nThere were no reported fatalities during the 2023 Hawaii wildfires.\n\n### Damage\n\nThe fires burned over 10,000 acres of land, and destroyed several homes and businesses.

This domain of life is distinct from prokaryotes, which lack a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles. Eukaryotes can be found in a wide range of environments, from the freezing cold to the hottest temperatures, and include organisms such as animals, plants, fungi, and protists.\n\n**Diversity**\n\nEukaryotes are incredibly diverse, with over 100,000 identified species and thousands more still to be discovered. This diversity can be seen in the different forms and functions of eukaryotic cells, which have evolved to occupy a wide range of ecological niches. Some eukaryotes, such as animals and fungi, are multicellular and have complex body structures, while others, such as protists, are single-celled and have simple structures.\n\nEukaryotes can be found in almost every habitat on Earth, from the freezing cold of Antarctica to the hottest deserts. They can live in freshwater, saltwater, and even in the soil. This diversity of habitats is reflected in the diversity of eukaryotic species, which have evolved to occupy specific niches within these environments.\n\n**Distinguishing features**\n\n### Nucleus\n\nOne of the key distinguishing features of eukaryotes is the presence of a true nucleus. This is a membrane-bound organelle that contains the cell's genetic material, which is made up of DNA. The nucleus is surrounded by a double membrane called the nuclear envelope, which regulates the movement of materials in and out of the nucleus. The nucleus is responsible for controlling the cell's growth, reproduction, and metabolism.\n\nIn addition to the nucleus, eukaryotic cells also have other membrane-bound organelles, such as mitochondria, chloroplasts, and lysosomes. These organelles are specialized to perform specific functions within the cell, such as generating energy, photosynthesizing, and breaking down waste.\n\n### Biochemistry\n\nEukaryotes have a complex biochemistry, with a wide range of metabolic pathways and enzymes. They are capable of producing a wide range of organic compounds, including sugars, amino acids, and fatty acids. They also have a variety of metabolic pathways, such as glycolysis and the citric acid cycle, which allow them to generate energy from the breakdown of nutrients.\n\nEukaryotes also have a range of enzymes that are involved in the breakdown and synthesis of molecules. These enzymes include proteases, lipases, and glycosidases, which break down proteins, fats, and carbohydrates, respectively. They also have enzymes involved in the synthesis of molecules, such as DNA polymerase and RNA polymerase, which are involved in the replication and transcription of DNA.\n\n### Internal membranes\n\nEukaryotic cells have a complex system of internal membranes, which are responsible for regulating the movement of materials in and out of the cell. These membranes include the plasma membrane, the nuclear envelope, and the mitochondria. The plasma membrane is a selectively permeable membrane that surrounds the cell and regulates the movement of materials in and out. The nuclear envelope is a double membrane that surrounds the nucleus and regulates the movement of materials in and out. The mitochondria are membrane-bound organelles that are responsible for generating energy for the cell.\n\n### Mitochondria\n\nMitochondria are membrane-bound organelles that are responsible for generating energy for the cell. They are found in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells and are often referred to as the \"powerhouses\" of the cell. Mitochondria have their own DNA, which is separate from the DNA found in the nucleus. This DNA is responsible for encoding the proteins that are involved in the generation of energy.\n\nMitochondria produce energy through a process called cellular respiration, which involves the breakdown of glucose and other organic molecules. This process releases energy in the form of ATP, which is then used to power the cell's metabolic processes.\n\n### Plastids\n\nPlastids are membrane-bound organelles that are found in plant cells and are responsible for photosynthesis. They are found in the cytoplasm of plant cells and are often referred to as the \"food factories\" of the cell. Plastids have their own DNA, which is separate from the DNA found in the nucleus. This DNA is responsible for encoding the proteins that are involved in photosynthesis.\n\nPlastids produce energy through the process of photosynthesis, which involves the conversion of light energy into chemical energy. This energy is then used to power the cell's metabolic processes.\n\n### Cytoskeletal structures\n\nEukaryotic cells have a complex system of cytoskeletal structures, which are responsible for providing support and shape to the cell. These structures include microtubules, microfilaments, and intermediate filaments. Microtubules are long, hollow tubes that are composed of tubulin proteins. They are involved in the movement of materials within the cell and are also responsible for maintaining the shape of the cell.\n\nMicrofilaments are long, thin filaments that are composed of actin proteins. They are involved in the movement of materials within the cell and are also responsible for maintaining the shape of the cell. Intermediate filaments are long, thin filaments that are composed of various proteins. They are involved in maintaining the shape of the cell and providing support to the cell.\n\n### Cell wall\n\nEukaryotic cells have a cell wall that provides support and protection to the cell. The cell wall is composed of various materials, including cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin. The cell wall is responsible for maintaining the shape of the cell and providing protection against external forces.\n\nIn plants, the cell wall is composed of cellulose microfibrils, which are embedded in a matrix of hemicellulose and pectin. The cellulose microfibrils provide strength and rigidity to the cell wall, while the hemicellulose and pectin help to maintain the shape of the cell and provide protection against external forces.\n\n### Sexual reproduction\n\nEukaryotes are capable of sexual reproduction, which involves the fusion of gametes to produce a zygote. This process involves the release of gametes, such as sperm and eggs, which then fuse to form a zygote. The zygote then develops into a new individual, which is genetically different from the parent cells.\n\nSexual reproduction allows for genetic variation and increases the chances of survival for the species. It also allows for the exchange of genetic material between individuals, which can result in the formation of new traits and characteristics.\n\n**Evolution**\n\n### History of classification\n\nThe classification of eukaryotes has a long and complex history. The first classification system was developed by Carolus Linnaeus in the 18th century, which divided living organisms into three kingdoms: Plantae, Animalia, and Mineralia. However, this system was later found to be inadequate and was modified by other scientists, such as Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and Charles Darwin.\n\nIn the 20th century, the classification of eukaryotes was revolutionized by the discovery of new cellular structures and the development of molecular biology. The discovery of DNA and the development of molecular techniques allowed for the classification of eukaryotes based on their genetic and molecular characteristics.\n\n### Phylogeny\n\nThe phylogeny of eukaryotes is complex and still not fully understood. However, it is believed that eukaryotes evolved from a common ancestor with archaea, which are a group of single-celled microorganisms. The exact relationship between eukaryotes and archaea is still a topic of debate among scientists.\n\nOne theory is that eukaryotes evolved from a group of archaea that lived in the early oceans, around 2.1 billion years ago. These early eukaryotes were thought to have had a simple cell structure, with a nucleus and a few membrane-bound organelles.\n\nOver time, these early eukaryotes evolved and diversified, leading to the formation of different groups and classes of eukaryotes. The evolution of eukaryotes is thought to have been driven by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, including the development of new cellular structures and the colonization of new environments.\n\n### Origin of eukaryotes\n\nThe origin of eukaryotes is still a topic of debate among scientists. However, it is believed that eukaryotes evolved from a group of archaea that lived in the early oceans, around 2.1 billion years ago. These early eukaryotes were thought to have had a simple cell structure, with a nucleus and a few membrane-bound organelles.\n\nOne theory is that eukaryotes evolved from a group of archaea that lived in the early oceans, where they were exposed to high levels of oxygen. This led to the development of new cellular structures, including the nucleus and membrane-bound organelles.\n\nOver time, these early eukaryotes evolved and diversified, leading to the formation of different groups and classes of eukaryotes. The evolution of eukaryotes is thought to have been driven by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, including the development of new cellular structures and the colonization of new environments.\n\n### Fossils\n\nFossils of eukaryotes have been found in rocks dating back to the early oceans, around 2.1 billion years ago. These fossils include simple cells with a nucleus and a few membrane-bound organelles.\n\nSome of the earliest fossils of eukaryotes include those of ancient algae and protists, which were found in rocks dating back to the Precambrian era. These fossils were found in rocks from Australia and South Africa, and provide important evidence of the early evolution of eukaryotes.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Archaea\n* Bacteria\n* Protista\n* Fungi\n* Animalia\n* Plantae\n* Eukaryotic cell\n\n**References**\n\n* This article does not have any references.\n\n**External links**\n\n* Eukaryote at the Encyclopedia of Life\n* Eukaryote at the National Center for Biotechnology Information\n* Eukaryote at the Tree of Life Web Project", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

He was a member of the House of Plantagenet and the grandson of King Henry III. Edward is considered one of the most successful English monarchs of the Middle Ages, known for his military campaigns, administrative reforms, and the establishment of English parliamentary institutions.\n\n**Early years, 1239–1263**\n\n#### **Childhood and Marriage**\n\nEdward was born at Westminster Palace, London, to King Henry III and Queen Eleanor of Provence. He was the eldest son and was designated as the heir apparent from an early age. Edward received a comprehensive education, studying Latin, French, and history, as well as engaging in martial pursuits, such as jousting and hunting. In 1254, at the age of 15, Edward married Eleanor of Castile, the daughter of King Alfonso X of Castile. The marriage was arranged by Edward's father to strengthen ties with Spain and secure a potential alliance.\n\n#### **Early Ambitions**\n\nAs the heir apparent, Edward was involved in various royal duties and administrative tasks, including the governance of Wales and the administration of justice. He also accompanied his father on several military campaigns, including the Ninth Crusade in 1270. During this time, Edward demonstrated his military prowess and leadership skills, which would later serve him well as king. However, his relationship with his father was strained, and Edward often found himself at odds with his father's advisors and policies.\n\n**Civil war and crusades, 1264–1273**\n\n#### **Second Barons' War**\n\nIn 1264, Edward's cousin, Simon de Montfort, led a rebellion against King Henry III, known as the Second Barons' War. Edward, who was then 25 years old, joined his father's forces and played a key role in the Battle of Lewes, where he was captured by the rebels. De Montfort, who had become the de facto ruler of England, released Edward from captivity, and he eventually joined the rebellion. However, Edward soon realized that de Montfort's goals were not aligned with his own, and he defected to his father's side. In 1265, Edward led a successful campaign against the rebels, and de Montfort was killed in the Battle of Evesham.\n\n#### **Crusade and Accession**\n\nIn 1270, Edward joined his father on the Ninth Crusade, but the king fell ill and died at the port of Viterbo. Edward returned to England and was crowned king on August 19, 1272, at Westminster Abbey. He then set out to reclaim the territories his father had conquered in France, but his military campaigns were initially unsuccessful. It was not until 1274, when Edward married Eleanor of Castile, that he began to focus on consolidating his power and asserting his authority as king.\n\n**Early reign, 1274–1296**\n\n#### **Conquest of Wales**\n\nIn 1277, Edward turned his attention to Wales, which had been in a state of rebellion since the death of his father. Edward launched a military campaign against the Welsh prince, Llywelyn ap Gruffydd, and in 1282, he captured the prince and had him executed. The conquest of Wales marked a significant milestone in Edward's reign, and he was hailed as a hero by the English people.\n\n#### **Diplomacy and War on the Continent**\n\nIn the 1280s, Edward turned his attention to the Continent, seeking to assert English influence and secure alliances with other European powers. He negotiated a treaty with the Holy Roman Emperor, Rudolf of Habsburg, and launched a series of military campaigns against the French, who had rejected his claims to the throne. Although Edward's military campaigns were initially successful, he was eventually forced to withdraw from France and negotiate a peace treaty.\n\n#### **Great Cause**\n\nIn 1291, Edward launched the Great Cause, a series of trials that aimed to determine the rightful heir to the Scottish throne. The trials, which were held in Westminster Hall, were a significant milestone in the development of English parliamentary institutions and marked a major turning point in the history of Scotland.\n\n**Government and law**\n\n#### **Character as King**\n\nEdward was known for his strong personality and his ability to assert his authority. He was a just and fair ruler, but also a demanding one, who expected loyalty and obedience from his subjects. Edward was also a patron of the arts and a supporter of education, and his court was renowned for its culture and sophistication.\n\n#### **Administration and the Law**\n\nEdward's government was characterized by a strong centralized administration, which was responsible for collecting taxes, maintaining law and order, and administering justice. The king's council, which was composed of his advisors and nobles, played a key role in the administration of the kingdom. Edward also established a system of sheriffs and justices of the peace, who were responsible for maintaining law and order in the localities.\n\n#### **Finances and Parliament**\n\nEdward's government was also characterized by a strong emphasis on finance, and he was known for his ability to raise taxes and secure loans. The king's parliament, which was first established in 1295, played a key role in the development of English parliamentary institutions and marked a major turning point in the history of the kingdom.\n\n#### **Parliament and the Expulsion of the Jews**\n\nIn 1290, Edward expelled the Jews from England, a move that was motivated by a combination of economic and social factors. The expulsion was a significant milestone in the history of English Jewry and marked a major turning point in the relationship between the English crown and the Jewish community.\n\n#### **Administration in Ireland**\n\nEdward also extended his administration to Ireland, which was then a kingdom in its own right. In 1296, he appointed his justiciar, John Wogan, to govern the kingdom and establish a system of administration that was similar to that in England.\n\n**Later reign, 1297–1307**\n\n#### **Constitutional Crisis**\n\nIn 1297, Edward faced a constitutional crisis when his nobles rebelled against his authority. The rebels, who were led by John de Warenne, Earl of Surrey, and Hugh de Audley, Earl of Gloucester, demanded that the king reduce his power and restore the rights of the nobility. Edward eventually agreed to their demands and established a system of government that was more representative of the nobility.\n\n#### **Return to Scotland**\n\nIn 1298, Edward launched a second invasion of Scotland, but his campaign was unsuccessful, and he was forced to negotiate a peace treaty with the Scots. In 1303, he launched a third invasion, but was again forced to withdraw.\n\n#### **Death and Burial**\n\nEdward died on July 7, 1307, at Burgh-by-Sands, near Carlisle, while on a campaign in Scotland. He was succeeded by his son, Edward II, who went on to become one of the most infamous English monarchs of the Middle Ages.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nEdward I is remembered as one of the most successful English monarchs of the Middle Ages. He established a strong centralized administration, expanded English territories, and developed English parliamentary institutions. He also patronized the arts and education, and his court was renowned for its culture and sophistication. Despite his many achievements, Edward's legacy is also marked by his role in the expulsion of the Jews from England and his brutal suppression of the Welsh and Scottish rebellions.\n\n**Family**\n\n#### **First Marriage**\n\nEdward's first marriage was to Eleanor of Castile, the daughter of King Alfonso X of Castile. The marriage was arranged by Edward's father to strengthen ties with Spain and secure a potential alliance.\n\n#### **Second Marriage**\n\nEdward's second marriage was to Margaret of France, the daughter of Philip IV of France. The marriage was arranged by Edward to secure an alliance with France and to consolidate his power in Europe.\n\n#### **Genealogical Table**\n\n|  | Edward I of England |\n| --- | --- |\n| Father | Henry III of England |\n| Mother | Eleanor of Provence |\n| First Wife | Eleanor of Castile |\n| Second Wife | Margaret of France |\n| Children | Edward II of England, Thomas of Brotherton, 1st Earl of Norfolk, Edmund of Woodstock, 1st Earl of Kent, John of Eltham, 1st Earl of Cornwall, Joan of Acre, Eleanor of Woodstock, Alfonso, Earl of Chester |\n\n**See also**\n\n* List of English monarchs\n* English monarchs family tree\n* Second Barons' War\n* Crusades\n* Great Cause\n* English parliamentary institutions\n* Expulsion of the Jews from England\n\n**Notes**\n\nThis article is based on the following sources:\n\n* \"The Life of Edward I\" by H.

Born Sanford Braun on December 30, 1935, in Brooklyn, New York, Koufax grew up in a Jewish family and developed a passion for baseball at a young age.\n\n# Early life\n\nKoufax's early life was marked by a strong interest in baseball, which was encouraged by his parents, Irving and Lorraine Braun. His father, a dentist, was a fan of the Brooklyn Dodgers and introduced Koufax to the game. Koufax attended Lafayette High School in Brooklyn, where he played baseball and basketball, and was eventually signed by the Dodgers in 1954.\n\n## Major League tryouts\n\nKoufax's first experience in the Major Leagues came in 1955, when he was called up from the minor leagues to replace injured pitcher Don Newcombe. He made his debut on June 18, 1955, against the Brooklyn's rival, the New York Giants. Koufax pitched 11 innings in his first start, allowing 4 runs on 7 hits, and went on to make 14 more starts that season.\n\n# Professional career\n\nKoufax's professional career can be divided into several distinct phases, each marked by significant achievements and challenges.\n\n## Early years (1955–1960)\n\nIn his early years with the Dodgers, Koufax struggled to establish himself as a reliable starting pitcher. He went 11-16 in 1956, and his ERA rose to 4.18. However, he showed flashes of brilliance, including a 4-hit shutout against the St. Louis Cardinals in 1957. Koufax's career took a significant turn in 1958, when he went 18-13 and posted a 2.81 ERA, which caught the attention of baseball fans and scouts.\n\n## Domination (1961–1964)\n\nKoufax's breakthrough season came in 1961, when he went 18-13 with a 3.52 ERA, and led the National League in strikeouts with 269. He became the first left-handed pitcher to lead the league in strikeouts since 1924. In 1962, Koufax improved his record to 20-18, with a 2.54 ERA and 306 strikeouts. This marked the beginning of a remarkable stretch of dominance, during which Koufax won three Cy Young Awards in a row (1963, 1965, and 1966).\n\n### 1961 season\n\nKoufax's 1961 season was a defining moment in his career. He pitched 35 games, 25 of which were starts, and accumulated a 2.97 ERA. On September 9, 1961, Koufax pitched a 10-inning complete game against the San Francisco Giants, allowing just 2 runs on 6 hits. This performance marked a turning point in Koufax's career, as he established himself as one of the top pitchers in the league.\n\n### 1962 season\n\nKoufax's 1962 season was even more impressive. He went 20-18 with a 2.54 ERA, and led the league in strikeouts with 306. Koufax's dominance on the mound was matched by his clutch performances in high-pressure situations. On August 11, 1962, Koufax pitched a 12-inning complete game against the St. Louis Cardinals, allowing just 3 runs on 7 hits. This performance showcased Koufax's ability to perform under pressure and cemented his status as one of the greatest pitchers of all time.\n\n### 1963 season\n\nKoufax's 1963 season was his first full season as a starter, and it was a resounding success. He went 25-5 with a 1.88 ERA, and led the league in strikeouts with 306. Koufax's dominance on the mound was matched by his clutch performances in high-pressure situations. On June 4, 1963, Koufax pitched a 9-inning complete game against the San Francisco Giants, allowing just 2 runs on 5 hits. This performance marked a turning point in Koufax's career, as he established himself as one of the greatest pitchers of all time.\n\n## Salary dispute\n\nIn the early 1960s, Koufax became embroiled in a salary dispute with the Dodgers. He was making just $30,000 per year, which was significantly lower than the league average. Koufax argued that he was worth more, given his impressive performances on the mound. The dispute was eventually resolved, with Koufax signing a new contract worth $60,000 per year.\n\n### 1964 season\n\nKoufax's 1964 season was marked by a salary dispute with the Dodgers. He went 19-3 with a 1.75 ERA, but was limited to just 14 starts due to the dispute. Koufax's performances on the mound were impressive, but he was frustrated by the lack of support from the team. On July 1, 1964, Koufax pitched a 9-inning complete game against the San Francisco Giants, allowing just 2 runs on 5 hits. This performance marked a turning point in Koufax's career, as he established himself as one of the greatest pitchers of all time.\n\n## Playing in pain (1965–66)\n\nKoufax's career was marked by a series of injuries, including a strained shoulder and a torn elbow ligament. Despite these injuries, Koufax continued to pitch at an elite level, earning him three Cy Young Awards in a row (1963, 1965, and 1966).\n\n### 1965 season\n\nKoufax's 1965 season was marked by a series of injuries, including a strained shoulder and a torn elbow ligament. Despite these injuries, Koufax continued to pitch at an elite level, going 26-8 with a 1.73 ERA. On September 9, 1965, Koufax pitched a 10-inning complete game against the San Francisco Giants, allowing just 2 runs on 6 hits.\n\n#### Perfection\n\nOn September 9, 1965, Koufax pitched a perfect game against the Chicago Cubs, striking out 14 batters and allowing just 3 hits. This performance marked a turning point in Koufax's career, as he established himself as one of the greatest pitchers of all time.\n\n#### World Series and Yom Kippur decision\n\nKoufax's 1965 season was also marked by a World Series appearance against the Minnesota Twins. Despite being injured, Koufax pitched 2 scoreless innings in Game 5, allowing just 2 hits. However, he declined to pitch on Yom Kippur, citing his Jewish faith. This decision was widely praised, as it showed Koufax's commitment to his faith.\n\n## Holdout\n\nIn the early 1960s, Koufax became embroiled in a holdout dispute with the Dodgers. He was making just $60,000 per year, which was significantly lower than the league average. Koufax argued that he was worth more, given his impressive performances on the mound. The dispute was eventually resolved, with Koufax signing a new contract worth $75,000 per year.\n\n### 1966 season\n\nKoufax's 1966 season was marked by a holdout dispute with the Dodgers. He went 27-9 with a 1.73 ERA, but was limited to just 11 starts due to the dispute. Koufax's performances on the mound were impressive, but he was frustrated by the lack of support from the team.\n\n## Retirement\n\nKoufax retired in 1966, citing a combination of injuries and a desire to pursue other interests. He was just 30 years old, but his impressive career was marked by a series of awards and accolades, including three Cy Young Awards and a perfect game.\n\n# Career overall\n\nKoufax's career is widely regarded as one of the greatest in baseball history. He won three Cy Young Awards in a row (1963, 1965, and 1966), and pitched a perfect game in 1965. Koufax's ERA of 2.76 is the lowest in Major League history among pitchers with at least 2,500 innings pitched.\n\n## Statistics and achievements\n\nKoufax's career statistics are impressive, including:\n\n* Wins: 165\n* Losses: 87\n* ERA: 2.76\n* Strikeouts: 2,396\n* No-hitters: 4\n* Perfect games: 1\n* Cy Young Awards: 3\n\n## Pitching style and repertoire\n\nKoufax was known for his dominant fastball, which was clocked at up to 100 mph. He also had a sharp curveball and a changeup. Koufax was a master of the strike zone, and was known for his ability to locate his pitches with precision.\n\n# Post-playing activities\n\nAfter retiring from baseball, Koufax went on to become a successful businessman and philanthropist. He was involved in various charitable organizations, including the Jewish National Fund and the American Cancer Society. Koufax was also a vocal advocate for social justice and civil rights.\n\n# Honors and recognition\n\nKoufax was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1972, in his first year of eligibility.

Meanwhile, Thiruchitrambalam's best friend, played by Soori, provides comedic relief and supports him in his relationships.\n\nAs Thiruchitrambalam navigates through various relationships, he learns valuable lessons about love, family, and himself.

The film serves as a sequel to the 2011 film Puss in Boots and is the fifth installment in the Shrek franchise. The film follows the adventures of the titular character, Puss in Boots, as he navigates the complexities of his own legend and confronts the consequences of his actions.\n\nPlot\n\nThe film takes place in a fantasy world where Puss in Boots, voiced by Antonio Banderas, is a legendary cat burglar and adventurer. Puss is on the run from the Perrito, a group of cats who seek to avenge their fallen leader, as well as from the Big Bad Wolf, who seeks to capture him. Puss teams up with a new group of allies, including a tough-as-nails adventurer named Fatima, voiced by Salma Hayek, and a street-smart tom cat named Perrito, voiced by Oscar Isaac. Together, they embark on a perilous journey to find the mythical Last Wish, a magical artifact that will grant Puss his heart's desire.\n\nHowever, their quest is complicated by the presence of a new villain, the infamous Moggy, voiced by John Mulaney, who seeks to steal the Last Wish for himself.

The concept of anti-Zionism has evolved over time, and its meaning has been shaped by various historical, cultural, and political contexts.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nZionism, the movement to establish a Jewish homeland in Palestine, has been a contentious issue since its inception in the late 19th century. The movement's supporters, known as Zionists, have argued that a Jewish state is necessary for the safety and well-being of the Jewish people. Conversely, anti-Zionists have contested this idea, citing concerns about the rights of the Palestinian people, the impact of a Jewish state on the region, and the implications of Zionism for Jewish identity and community.\n\n**Anti-Zionism before 1948**\n\n**Early Jewish anti-Zionism**\n\nAnti-Zionism within the Jewish community has a complex history. Some early Jewish intellectuals, such as Theodor Herzl, were initially opposed to the idea of a Jewish homeland, seeing it as a betrayal of the universalist ideals of the Enlightenment. Others, like Ber Borochov, argued that a Jewish state would be a necessary step towards the ultimate goal of a socialist, classless society. In the pre-state period, Jewish anti-Zionist groups like the Poalei Zion and the Hashomer Hatzair advocated for a Jewish homeland, but with a socialist or democratic twist.\n\n**Early Arab anti-Zionism**\n\nArab opposition to Zionism has been well-documented since the early 20th century. Arab leaders like King Hussein of Hejaz and President Emir Faisal of Syria protested against the Balfour Declaration, which expressed British support for a Jewish homeland in Palestine. Arab intellectuals, such as Muhammad Al-Muwaylihi, wrote extensively about the dangers of Zionism, arguing that it threatened Arab identity and interests.\n\n**Reactions to the Balfour Declaration**\n\nThe Balfour Declaration, issued in 1917, was a significant turning point in the history of Zionism and anti-Zionism. While the declaration expressed British support for a Jewish homeland in Palestine, it also acknowledged Arab rights to the territory. However, the declaration's ambiguity and contradictions have been the subject of much debate and criticism.\n\n**Anti-Zionism in the 1920s–1930s**\n\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, anti-Zionism became increasingly prominent in the Arab world. The rise of Arab nationalism, led by figures like King Faisal II of Iraq and King Abdullah I of Jordan, emphasized the importance of Arab unity and resistance to Zionism. The Palestinian Arab Revolt, which began in 1936, was a major anti-Zionist uprising that called for Arab independence and the expulsion of Jewish settlers.\n\n**The Biltmore programme and its anti-Zionism fall-out**\n\nIn 1942, the Biltmore Conference in New York adopted a resolution calling for the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine. This move was seen as a major departure from the earlier Zionist consensus, which had advocated for a Jewish homeland within the framework of the British Mandate. Anti-Zionist groups, both within and outside the Jewish community, denounced the Biltmore programme as a threat to Arab rights and a betrayal of the principles of democracy and equality.\n\n**Religious**\n\nReligious opposition to Zionism has a long history, dating back to the early 20th century. Some Jewish groups, like the Neturei Karta, have argued that Zionism is a form of idolatry, contradicting the principles of traditional Judaism. In the Arab world, Islamic scholars have criticized Zionism as a threat to Islamic values and a challenge to the authority of the Quran. Christian denominations have also expressed opposition to Zionism, citing concerns about the impact of a Jewish state on Christian-Palestinian relations and the Holy Land.\n\n**Anti-Zionism after World War II and the creation of Israel**\n\n**1947–1948**\n\nThe UN Partition Plan, adopted in 1947, recommended the creation of separate Jewish and Arab states in Palestine. However, the plan was widely opposed by Arab leaders, who saw it as a betrayal of their rights and a threat to Arab identity. The establishment of the state of Israel in 1948 led to the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, known as the Nakba or \"catastrophe\" in Arabic.\n\n**Soviet Union**\n\nThe Soviet Union was an early supporter of the Palestinian cause, viewing Zionism as a form of imperialism and a threat to socialism. In the 1950s and 1960s, the Soviet Union provided diplomatic and economic support to the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), which became a major anti-Zionist force.\n\n**Arab and Palestinian anti-Zionism**\n\nArab and Palestinian anti-Zionism has been a dominant force in the region since the mid-20th century. The PLO, founded in 1964, has been a key player in the anti-Zionist movement, advocating for Palestinian rights and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state. Other groups, like Hamas, have also been vocal in their opposition to Zionism, viewing it as a threat to Arab identity and Islamic values.\n\n**Perception of Zionism as racism**\n\nDuring the Cold War, anti-Zionism became increasingly linked to anti-racism and anti-imperialism. The Soviet Union, Cuba, and other socialist countries argued that Zionism was a form of racism, perpetuating colonialism and apartheid in Palestine. This perception was further reinforced by the United Nations, which adopted several resolutions condemning Zionism as a form of racism.\n\n**Islamic perspectives**\n\nIslamic perspectives on Zionism have been shaped by a long history of conflict and competition between Islam and Judaism. Many Muslim scholars and leaders have viewed Zionism as a threat to Islamic values and a challenge to the authority of the Quran. In recent years, Islamic anti-Zionism has become increasingly prominent, with many Muslim countries and organizations advocating for Palestinian rights and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.\n\n**Left-wing politics**\n\nLeft-wing politics has been a key component of anti-Zionism, with many socialist and communist parties viewing Zionism as a form of imperialism and a threat to socialism. In the 1960s and 1970s, left-wing groups like the New Left and the anti-war movement emerged as major anti-Zionist forces, advocating for Palestinian rights and the end of US support for Israel.\n\n**Christian anti-Zionism**\n\nChristian anti-Zionism has a long history, dating back to the early 20th century. Some Christian denominations, like the Catholic Church, have expressed opposition to Zionism, citing concerns about the impact of a Jewish state on Christian-Palestinian relations and the Holy Land. Protestant denominations, like the Presbyterian Church, have also been critical of Zionism, viewing it as a form of colonialism and a threat to Palestinian rights.\n\n**Haredi Judaism**\n\nHaredi Judaism has been a significant force in the anti-Zionist movement, with many Haredi groups viewing Zionism as a form of idolatry and a betrayal of traditional Jewish values. In recent years, Haredi opposition to Zionism has become increasingly prominent, with some Haredi leaders advocating for a boycott of Israel and the establishment of a separate Haredi state.\n\n**Allegations of antisemitism**\n\nAnti-Zionism has been accused of being a form of antisemitism, with some critics arguing that opposition to Zionism is inherently anti-Jewish. However, many anti-Zionists argue that this charge is unfounded, citing the distinction between opposition to Zionism and opposition to Jews as individuals. Others argue that the charge of antisemitism is often used to silence critics of Zionism and to stifle debate about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\n**Jewish right to a state**\n\nThe right to a Jewish state has been a central issue in the anti-Zionist debate, with many anti-Zionists arguing that the concept of a Jewish state is inherently racist and exclusionary. Others argue that the Jewish people have a legitimate right to self-determination and a homeland, but that this right should not come at the expense of Palestinian rights and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.\n\n**Equating and correlating anti-Zionism with antisemitism**\n\nSome critics of anti-Zionism have equated anti-Zionism with antisemitism, arguing that opposition to Zionism is inherently anti-Jewish. However, this charge has been widely criticized as unfounded and simplistic, ignoring the complex historical and cultural contexts of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\n**View that the two are not interlinked**\n\nMany anti-Zionists argue that opposition to Zionism is not inherently anti-Jewish, citing the distinction between opposition to Zionism and opposition to Jews as individuals. Others argue that the charge of antisemitism is often used to silence critics of Zionism and to stifle debate about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\n**Shifting positions on the Zionist/Anti-Zionist spectrum**\n\nIn recent years, there has been a significant shift in the anti-Zionist movement, with many anti-Zionists moving towards a more nuanced and inclusive approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Some anti-Zionists have begun to advocate for a two-state solution, while others have called for a boycott of Israel and the establishment of a single, democratic state.\n\n**Far-right politics**\n\nFar-right politics has been a significant force in the pro-Zionist movement, with many far-right groups advocating for a Jewish state and the suppression of Palestinian rights. However, some far-right groups have also been critical of Zionism, viewing it as a form of socialism or communism.\n\n**Conspiracy theories**\n\nConspiracy theories have played a significant role in the anti-Zionist movement, with some anti-Zionists arguing that Zionism is a plot to control the world or to impose a new world order. However, these conspiracy theories have been widely criticized as unfounded and simplistic, ignoring the complex historical and cultural contexts of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Zionism\n* Israel\n* Palestine\n* Jewish nationalism\n* Arab nationalism\n* Anti-Semitism\n* Antizionism in the United Kingdom\n* Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement\n\n**Notes**\n\nThis article is a comprehensive overview of the complex and multifaceted issue of anti-Zionism.

The two breakaway territories in eastern Ukraine declared independence from Ukraine in 2014, leading to a significant escalation of the conflict. The recognition or non-recognition of these territories has had far-reaching implications for international relations, regional stability, and the overall conflict dynamics.\n\n**History**\n\nThe annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014 marked the beginning of a new phase in the conflict. In April 2014, pro-Russian protests broke out in eastern Ukraine, resulting in the establishment of the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic. The two territories declared independence from Ukraine, citing the need for self-defense and protection from Ukrainian forces. Russia, which had been providing military and economic support to the separatists, recognized the two territories as independent states in 2014.\n\nThe conflict escalated significantly in 2014, with the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 (MH17) in July, killing 298 people. The incident led to widespread international condemnation and increased pressure on Russia to take a more active role in resolving the conflict. In 2015, the Minsk Agreement was signed, aimed at bringing peace to the region. However, the agreement has been repeatedly violated, leading to ongoing fighting and a stalemate in the conflict.\n\n**Aftermath of Russian recognition**\n\nIn recognition of the DPR and LPR, Russia created a number of formal channels to engage with the two territories. In 2015, Russia established a \"humanitarian corridor\" to provide aid to the territories, which has been criticized by Ukraine and other international actors as a form of support for the separatists. Russia has also been accused of providing military support to the separatists, although the extent of this support is disputed.\n\nIn 2019, Russia's Constitutional Court ruled that the two territories were not part of Ukraine and that Russia had the right to recognize them as independent states. The ruling marked a significant escalation of Russia's position on the conflict and has been criticized by Ukraine and other international actors as a violation of international law.\n\n**Countries and entities that recognized the DPR and LPR as independent states**\n\n### UN member states\n\n* **Russia**: Russia was the first country to recognize the DPR and LPR as independent states in 2014. Since then, Russia has maintained a close relationship with the two territories and has provided significant economic and military support.\n* **South Ossetia**: In 2015, South Ossetia, a breakaway territory in Georgia, recognized the DPR and LPR as independent states.\n* **Nagorno-Karabakh**: In 2015, Nagorno-Karabakh, a breakaway territory in Azerbaijan, also recognized the DPR and LPR as independent states.\n\n### Non-UN states\n\n* **Abkhazia**: Abkhazia, a breakaway territory in Georgia, recognized the DPR and LPR as independent states in 2015.\n* **Transnistria**: Transnistria, a breakaway territory in Moldova, has expressed support for the DPR and LPR and has been accused of providing military support to the separatists.\n* **Tibet**: Tibet, a region in western China, has expressed support for the DPR and LPR and has been accused of providing humanitarian aid to the separatists.\n\n**Positions by other countries**\n\n### Countries and entities that supported recognizing the DPR and LPR as independent states\n\n* **China**: China has expressed support for the DPR and LPR and has been accused of providing humanitarian aid to the separatists.\n* **Belarus**: Belarus has expressed support for the DPR and LPR and has been accused of providing military support to the separatists.\n* **Syria**: Syria has expressed support for the DPR and LPR and has been accused of providing military support to the separatists.\n\n### Countries and entities that did not support recognizing the DPR and LPR as independent states\n\n* **United States**: The United States has consistently opposed the recognition of the DPR and LPR as independent states, citing the need for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n* **European Union**: The European Union has also opposed the recognition of the DPR and LPR as independent states, citing the need for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n* **Canada**: Canada has also opposed the recognition of the DPR and LPR as independent states, citing the need for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\n### Non-UN states\n\n* **Taiwan**: Taiwan has expressed opposition to the recognition of the DPR and LPR as independent states, citing the need for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n* **Israel**: Israel has expressed opposition to the recognition of the DPR and LPR as independent states, citing the need for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\n### International and regional organizations\n\n* **Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE)**: The OSCE has consistently opposed the recognition of the DPR and LPR as independent states, citing the need for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n* **Council of Europe**: The Council of Europe has also opposed the recognition of the DPR and LPR as independent states, citing the need for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\n**See also**\n\n* **Russo-Ukrainian War**\n* **Donetsk People's Republic**\n* **Luhansk People's Republic**\n* **Minsk Agreement**\n* **Annexation of Crimea by Russia**\n\n**Notes**\n\nThe international recognition of the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic is a complex and sensitive issue that has been a topic of debate and discussion since the outbreak of the Russo-Ukrainian War in 2014. The recognition or non-recognition of these territories has had far-reaching implications for international relations, regional stability, and the overall conflict dynamics.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

Rowling, is a British novelist best known for her fantasy novels in the Harry Potter series. Born on July 31, 1965, in Yate, England, Rowling has become one of the most successful authors of all time, with her books translated into over 80 languages and sold more than 500 million copies worldwide.\n\n**Life and Career**\n\n### Early Life and Family\n\nJoanne Kathleen Rowling was born to Peter James Rowling and Anne Volant Rowling, a flight attendant. Her father was an aircraft engineer, and her mother was a researcher and writer. Rowling has two older sisters, Dianne and Dianna, and a younger sister, Dina. The family moved to Winterbourne, Bristol, when Rowling was one year old.\n\nRowling's early years were marked by her mother's struggles with multiple sclerosis, which forced the family to move to a small flat in the Clifton area of Bristol. Rowling's parents divorced when she was nine years old, and her mother's health continued to decline. Rowling has spoken publicly about the difficulties she faced during this period, including poverty and neglect.\n\n### Secondary School and University\n\nRowling attended Wyedean Comprehensive School in Gloucestershire, where she was an average student. She developed a passion for writing and reading, and her teachers encouraged her to continue pursuing her creative interests. After completing her secondary education, Rowling attended the University of Exeter, where she studied French and Classics. During her time at university, Rowling became involved in the university's Amnesty International group and began to develop her writing skills.\n\n### Inspiration and Mother's Death\n\nRowling's mother died of multiple sclerosis on December 30, 1990, at the age of 45. This event had a profound impact on Rowling, who has spoken about the pain and loneliness she experienced following her mother's death. Rowling has credited her mother's death with inspiring her to write the Harry Potter series, which features a mother figure in the character of Lily Potter.\n\n### Marriage, Divorce and Single Parenthood\n\nIn 1992, Rowling married Portuguese television journalist Jorge Arantes, and the couple had a daughter, Jessica, in 1993. However, the marriage was short-lived, and the couple divorced in 1995. Rowling has spoken about the challenges she faced as a single mother, including poverty and depression.\n\n### Publishing Harry Potter\n\nRowling began writing the first Harry Potter book in 1990, while on a delayed train from Manchester to London. The book, which would eventually be published as Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, was initially rejected by twelve publishers. However, Bloomsbury agreed to publish the book in 1997, after the mother of Rowling's friend had convinced the publisher's children's book editor to read the manuscript.\n\nThe book's success was overwhelming, and the series went on to become a global phenomenon. Rowling wrote the remaining six books in the series over the next decade, with each book building on the previous one and introducing new characters and themes.\n\n### Films\n\nThe Harry Potter series has been adapted into a series of films, with Warner Bros. Pictures releasing eight movies between 2001 and 2011. The films have been critically acclaimed and have grossed over $7 billion at the box office. Rowling has been involved in the production of the films, serving as a producer on several of them.\n\n### Religion, Wealth and Remarriage\n\nRowling has spoken publicly about her Christian faith, which has been a source of inspiration for her writing. In 2001, she became one of the richest women in the world, with an estimated net worth of over $1 billion. Rowling married Neil Murray, a Scottish doctor, in 2001, and the couple has two sons, Mackenzie and David.\n\n### Adult Fiction and Robert Galbraith\n\nIn addition to the Harry Potter series, Rowling has written several adult fiction novels under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith. The first book, The Cuckoo's Calling, was published in 2013 and received critical acclaim. The second book, The Silkworm, was published in 2014, and the third book, Career of Evil, was published in 2015.\n\n### Later Harry Potter Works\n\nIn 2016, Rowling published a new Harry Potter book, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, which was written in collaboration with Jack Thorne and John Tiffany. The book is set nineteen years after the events of the original series and follows the story of Harry's youngest son, Albus.\n\n### Children's Stories\n\nRowling has also written several children's stories, including The Tales of Beedle the Bard and Quidditch Through the Ages. The Tales of Beedle the Bard was published in 2008 and features five fairy tales from the wizarding world. Quidditch Through the Ages was published in 2001 and provides a comprehensive guide to the sport of Quidditch.\n\n**Influences**\n\nRowling's writing has been influenced by a wide range of authors and books, including J.R.R. Tolkien, Philip Pullman, and Dickens. She has also been influenced by her own experiences as a single mother and her struggles with poverty and depression.\n\n**Style and Themes**\n\n### Style and Allusions\n\nRowling's writing style is characterized by its use of descriptive language and its ability to evoke a sense of magic and wonder. She often incorporates allusions to mythology and folklore into her stories, which adds depth and complexity to her narrative.\n\n### Themes\n\nRowling's writing often explores themes of love, loss, and the struggle between good and evil. Her stories often feature children as heroes, and she has been praised for her ability to create relatable and engaging characters.\n\n**Reception**\n\n### Gender and Social Division\n\nRowling's writing has been praised for its portrayal of female characters and its exploration of issues related to gender and social division. Her stories often feature strong female characters, such as Hermione Granger and Ginny Weasley, who are intelligent, resourceful, and independent.\n\n### Religious Reactions\n\nRowling's writing has been the subject of controversy and criticism from some religious groups, who have accused her of promoting a form of paganism and witchcraft. However, Rowling has consistently denied these claims, stating that her writing is intended to be a form of entertainment and not a form of proselytizing.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nRowling's legacy as a writer and a philanthropist is profound and far-reaching. She has been recognized for her contributions to education and literacy, and her books have been translated into over 80 languages and sold more than 500 million copies worldwide.\n\n**Legal Disputes**\n\nRowling has been involved in several high-profile legal disputes, including a lawsuit against the publishers of a book that accused her of plagiarism. However, the lawsuit was ultimately settled out of court.\n\n**Philanthropy**\n\nRowling has been involved in several charitable organizations, including the One Parent Families organization and the Multiple Sclerosis Research Foundation. She has also donated millions of dollars to various charities and educational institutions.\n\n**Views**\n\n### Politics\n\nRowling has expressed her views on politics, stating that she is a supporter of the Labour Party in the UK. She has also expressed her opposition to the Conservative Party's policies on education and welfare.\n\n### Press\n\nRowling has been the subject of much media attention and scrutiny, including criticism from some members of the press. However, she has consistently maintained a strong and independent voice, speaking out on issues related to education, politics, and social justice.\n\n### Transgender People\n\nRowling has been a vocal supporter of transgender people and has spoken out against transphobia and hate crimes.
