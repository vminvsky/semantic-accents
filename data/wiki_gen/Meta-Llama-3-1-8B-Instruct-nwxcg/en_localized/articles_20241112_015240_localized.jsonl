It formed on February 4, 2022, and dissipated on February 16, 2022. This article provides an overview of the meteorological history, preparations, impact, and aftermath of the cyclone.\n\n# Meteorological History\n\nCyclone Batsirai originated in the southern Indian Ocean, approximately 750 kilometers (466 miles) northwest of the French island of Réunion. The system developed from a tropical disturbance that had been tracked by the Mauritius Meteorological Services (MMS) since February 2, 2022. On February 4, the disturbance intensified into a tropical depression, and by February 5, it had strengthened into a tropical cyclone.\n\nThe cyclone moved south-southeastward, influenced by a subtropical high-pressure belt to the west and a low-pressure system to the east. On February 7, Cyclone Batsirai reached its peak intensity, with maximum sustained winds of approximately 220 kilometers per hour (137 miles per hour). The system maintained its strength for several days, causing widespread damage and disruption in the region.\n\n# Preparations\n\n## Mauritius\n\nAs Cyclone Batsirai approached, the government of Mauritius issued a red alert for the island nation, warning of severe damage and loss of life. The MMS issued regular updates on the cyclone's progress, and the National Emergency Response Committee activated its emergency response plan. Residents were advised to evacuate low-lying areas and seek shelter in safe locations.\n\n## Madagascar\n\nThe government of Madagascar also issued a red alert for the cyclone, and authorities in the affected regions prepared emergency shelters and evacuation centers. The Malagasy Meteorological Service (SMS) issued regular updates on the cyclone's progress, and the National Emergency Response Committee activated its emergency response plan. Residents were advised to evacuate low-lying areas and seek shelter in safe locations.\n\n# Impact\n\n## Mauritius\n\nCyclone Batsirai made landfall in Mauritius on February 8, 2022, causing widespread damage and disruption. The cyclone brought strong winds and heavy rainfall, resulting in the loss of power and communication services. The cyclone also caused significant flooding, particularly in the low-lying areas of the capital city, Port Louis.\n\nThe cyclone caused significant damage to infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and buildings. Several homes were destroyed or damaged, leaving many residents without shelter. The cyclone also caused significant economic losses, particularly in the agricultural and tourism sectors.\n\n## Réunion\n\nCyclone Batsirai also affected the French island of Réunion, located approximately 750 kilometers (466 miles) southwest of Mauritius. The cyclone brought strong winds and heavy rainfall, resulting in the loss of power and communication services. The cyclone also caused significant flooding, particularly in the low-lying areas of the capital city, Saint-Denis.\n\n## Madagascar\n\nThe cyclone also had a significant impact on Madagascar, particularly in the southern region of the island nation. The cyclone brought strong winds and heavy rainfall, resulting in the loss of power and communication services. The cyclone also caused significant flooding, particularly in the low-lying areas of the cities of Toliara and Farafangana.\n\nThe cyclone caused significant damage to infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and buildings. Several homes were destroyed or damaged, leaving many residents without shelter. The cyclone also caused significant economic losses, particularly in the agricultural and tourism sectors.\n\n# Aftermath\n\n## Mauritius\n\nIn the aftermath of the cyclone, the government of Mauritius declared a state of emergency and activated its emergency response plan. The National Emergency Response Committee was responsible for coordinating relief efforts, including the distribution of food, water, and shelter to affected residents.\n\nThe government also established a relief fund to provide financial assistance to affected residents and businesses. The fund was supported by international donors, including the United Nations and the European Union.\n\n## Madagascar\n\nIn the aftermath of the cyclone, the government of Madagascar declared a state of emergency and activated its emergency response plan. The National Emergency Response Committee was responsible for coordinating relief efforts, including the distribution of food, water, and shelter to affected residents.\n\nThe government also established a relief fund to provide financial assistance to affected residents and businesses.

He then joined the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) as a staff attorney and later became the EEOC's acting chair from 1982 to 1983.\n\n**District of Columbia Court of Appeals**\n\nIn 1983, President Ronald Reagan appointed Thomas to the U.S. Department of Education as an assistant secretary for civil rights. He served in that position until 1987, when he was appointed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Thomas served on the D.C. Circuit from 1988 to 1990 and gained a reputation as a conservative jurist.\n\n**Nomination to the Supreme Court**\n\nIn 1991, President George H.W. Bush nominated Thomas to the Supreme Court to replace Thurgood Marshall, who was retiring. Thomas's nomination was met with controversy, particularly when Anita Hill, a former colleague of Thomas's at the EEOC, accused him of sexual harassment. Hill testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, alleging that Thomas had made unwanted advances and created a hostile work environment.\n\n**Anita Hill Accusations**\n\nHill's accusations sparked a national debate about sexual harassment and the confirmation process. Despite Hill's testimony, Thomas maintained that he had done nothing wrong and that Hill's accusations were motivated by her own career ambitions. The Senate Judiciary Committee voted to recommend Thomas's nomination, but the full Senate was divided, and a second hearing was held.\n\n**Second Hearing**\n\nThe second hearing was marked by intense questioning of Hill and Thomas, with some senators accusing Hill of lying and others supporting her testimony. Despite the controversy, Thomas maintained his innocence and eventually won the support of the Senate.\n\n**Senate Votes**\n\nOn October 15, 1991, the Senate voted 52-48 to confirm Thomas to the Supreme Court. Thomas was sworn in on October 23, 1991, becoming the second African American to serve on the Court.\n\n**Supreme Court of the United States**\n\n**Government Powers and Legal Structure**\n\nThomas has been a strong advocate for limited government and individual rights. He has written numerous opinions on issues related to government powers and legal structure, including:\n\n* **Court Precedent**: Thomas has argued that the Supreme Court should not overturn precedent unless it is clearly unconstitutional. He has voted to uphold precedent in several high-profile cases, including the landmark decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992).\n* **Executive Power**: Thomas has argued that the executive branch has significant latitude in matters of foreign policy and national security. He has written opinions upholding the president's authority in cases such as Hamdi v. Rumsfeld (2004).\n* **Federalism and States' Rights**: Thomas has argued that the federal government should not overstep its authority and that states should have more flexibility in matters of policy. He has written opinions upholding state power in cases such as Gonzales v. Raich (2005).\n\n**Individual Rights**\n\nThomas has been a strong advocate for individual rights, including:\n\n* **First Amendment**: Thomas has argued that the First Amendment protects freedom of speech, even when it is unpopular or offensive. He has written opinions upholding the First Amendment in cases such as Citizens United v. FEC (2010).\n* **Second Amendment**: Thomas has argued that the Second Amendment protects the right to bear arms. He has written opinions upholding the Second Amendment in cases such as District of Columbia v. Heller (2008).\n* **Fourth Amendment**: Thomas has argued that the Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. He has written opinions upholding the Fourth Amendment in cases such as Arizona v. Gant (2009).\n* **Sixth Amendment**: Thomas has argued that the Sixth Amendment protects the right to a fair trial. He has written opinions upholding the Sixth Amendment in cases such as Blakely v. Washington (2004).\n* **Eighth Amendment**: Thomas has argued that the Eighth Amendment prohibits cruel and unusual punishment. He has written opinions upholding the Eighth Amendment in cases such as Roper v. Simmons (2005).\n* **Fourteenth Amendment**: Thomas has argued that the Fourteenth Amendment protects the due process rights of individuals. He has written opinions upholding the Fourteenth Amendment in cases such as Boumediene v. Bush (2008).\n* **Abortion and Family Planning**: Thomas has been a strong opponent of abortion and has written opinions upholding restrictions on abortion in cases such as Gonzales v. Carhart (2007).\n* **LGBTQ Rights**: Thomas has been a strong opponent of LGBTQ rights and has written opinions upholding restrictions on LGBTQ individuals in cases such as Hollingsworth v. Perry (2013).\n\n**Oral Arguments**\n\nThomas is known for his tough questioning of lawyers during oral arguments. He has been a strong advocate for the role of judges in shaping the law and has been critical of lawyers who he believes are trying to manipulate the Court.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\n**Family**\n\nThomas was married to Kathy Ambush from 1971 until her death in 1984. He married Virginia Lamp in 1987, and they had a daughter, Greta, in 1991. Thomas and his wife are devout Catholics and have been known to attend Mass together.\n\n**Religion**\n\nThomas is a devout Catholic and has spoken publicly about the role of faith in his life. He has been a strong supporter of the Catholic Church and has written opinions upholding the rights of Catholics in cases such as Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School v. EEOC (2012).\n\n**Literary Influences**\n\nThomas has spoken about the influence of authors such as Ayn Rand and Friedrich Hayek on his thought. He has also spoken about the importance of literature in shaping his understanding of the world.\n\n**Moira Smith Allegations**\n\nIn 1992, a former employee of Thomas's at the EEOC, Moira Smith, accused Thomas of making unwanted advances and creating a hostile work environment. Thomas denied the allegations, and Smith eventually dropped her complaint.\n\n**Nondisclosure of Finances**\n\nIn 2010, it was revealed that Thomas had not disclosed his finances as required by the Ethics in Government Act. Thomas eventually disclosed his finances, but the incident sparked a controversy about the lack of transparency on the Court.\n\n**Honors and Recognition**\n\nThomas has received numerous honors and awards for his service on the Supreme Court, including:\n\n* **American Bar Association**: Thomas was awarded the American Bar Association's highest honor, the American Bar Association's Gold Medal, in 2009.\n* **National Bar Association**: Thomas was awarded the National Bar Association's highest honor, the National Bar Association's Distinguished Service Award, in 2011.\n* **Catholic University of America**: Thomas was awarded an honorary degree from the Catholic University of America in 2009.\n\n**In Popular Culture**\n\nThomas has been the subject of numerous books, articles, and documentaries. He has been portrayed by actors such as Laurence Fishburne in the TV movie \"The Confirmation\" (1996) and by Geoffrey Rush in the TV movie \"The Supreme Court: The First 200 Years\" (2012).\n\n**Writings**\n\nThomas has written several books, including:\n\n* **\"Getting Right with God: Wrestling the Truth with My Brother Clarence\"** (2010) - a memoir about Thomas's childhood and his relationship with his brother.\n* **\"Clarence Thomas: A Biography\"** (2012) - a biography of Thomas's life and career.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* **List of Supreme Court Justices**\n* **United States Supreme Court**\n* **Supreme Court of the United States**\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n* **1**: Thomas was born in Pin Point, Georgia, and grew up in a low-income family.\n* **2**: Thomas attended the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts, and graduated magna cum laude in 1971.\n* **3**: Thomas worked as an assistant attorney general in Missouri from 1974 to 1977 and later became a director of community relations at the Monsanto Company.\n* **4**: Thomas was appointed to the U.S. Department of Education as an assistant secretary for civil rights in 1981 and served until 1982.\n* **5**: Thomas was appointed to the EEOC as a staff attorney in 1982 and later became the EEOC's acting chair from 1982 to 1983.\n* **6**: Thomas was appointed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 1988 and served until 1990.\n* **7**: Thomas was nominated to the Supreme Court by President George H.W.

Born on September 26, 1948, in Cambridge, England, she rose to international fame in the 1970s with a string of hit songs and starring roles in film. Throughout her career, Newton-John has been recognized for her contributions to music, film, and social causes, earning numerous awards and accolades.\n\nEarly life and family\n\nNewton-John was born to Irene and Brinley Newton-John, a professor of pharmacology. She has one older brother, Hugh, and a younger sister, Rona. When Newton-John was 10, the family moved to Australia, settling in Melbourne, where she began singing and acting at a young age. Her early influences included American country music and classic Hollywood musicals.\n\nCareer\n\n### Career beginnings\n\nNewton-John's music career began in the late 1960s, performing in local talent shows and competitions. She eventually moved to the United Kingdom, where she scored a recording contract with Decca Records. Her first single, \"Till You Say You'll Be Mine,\" was released in 1966, but it did not gain significant attention.\n\n### 1971–1974: Early success\n\nNewton-John's breakthrough came in 1971 with her cover of Bobbie Gentry's \"Little Green Bag.\" However, it was her 1971 single \"If Not for You\" that brought her initial success. The song, a cover of a Bob Dylan track, reached the top 10 in the UK. Newton-John's subsequent singles, \"What Is Life\" and \"My Love,\" also charted well.\n\n### 1975–1977: Have You Never Been Mellow, Clearly Love, and continued success\n\nNewton-John's success continued with the release of her 1975 album \"Have You Never Been Mellow,\" which included the hit single \"Have You Never Been Mellow.\" The song, a ballad about a past relationship, reached the top 10 in the US and UK. Newton-John's subsequent albums, \"Clearly Love\" (1975) and \"Want Ad/Land\" (1976), also spawned successful singles, including \"I Honestly Love You\" and \"You're the One.\"\n\n### 1978–1979: Grease and Totally Hot\n\nNewton-John's career took a significant turn in 1978 with the release of the film \"Grease,\" in which she starred alongside John Travolta as Sandy Olsson. The movie's soundtrack, featuring Newton-John and Travolta, became one of the best-selling albums of all time. The film's success catapulted Newton-John to international stardom. Her subsequent album, \"Totally Hot\" (1978), also spawned a hit single with the title track.\n\n### Lawsuit against MCA Records\n\nIn the early 1980s, Newton-John was involved in a highly publicized lawsuit against MCA Records, her record label at the time. Newton-John claimed that the label had not paid her royalties for the use of her name and image in advertising and merchandising. The lawsuit was eventually settled out of court.\n\n### 1980–1988: Physical, Soul Kiss, and The Rumour\n\nNewton-John's musical output in the 1980s was marked by a more pop-oriented sound. Her 1981 album \"Physical\" spawned the hit single \"Physical,\" which reached number one in the US. Newton-John's subsequent albums, \"Soul Kiss\" (1985) and \"The Rumour\" (1988), also included successful singles, including \"Soul Kiss\" and \"The Rumour.\"\n\n### 1989–1998: Motherhood, cancer, and advocacy\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, Newton-John became a mother to two daughters, Chloe and Isabelle. Her music output slowed during this period, but she continued to release new material, including the album \"Ga Ga\" (1990). Newton-John was also involved in various charitable causes, including the creation of the Olivia Newton-John Cancer and Wellness Centre in Australia.\n\n### 1998–2012: Later releases\n\nNewton-John released several albums in the late 1990s and early 2000s, including \"Back to Basics\" (1998), \"Satisfied\" (1999), and \"Christmas Wish\" (2000).

This approach helped SVB to build a loyal customer base and establish itself as a leader in the financial services industry.\n\n**Expansion**\n\nIn the 1990s, SVB began to expand its operations beyond the Silicon Valley region. The bank opened new branches in other parts of California and in other states, including Oregon, Washington, and Nevada. This expansion helped SVB to increase its customer base and provide its services to a wider range of companies.\n\nSVB also expanded its range of financial services during this period. The bank began to offer a wider range of investment products, including stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. It also established a venture capital arm, which invested in early-stage technology companies.\n\nIn addition to its expansion into new markets and services, SVB also made significant investments in technology during this period. The bank established a state-of-the-art online banking platform, which allowed customers to access their accounts and conduct financial transactions over the internet. This platform helped SVB to improve customer convenience and reduce the costs associated with traditional banking.\n\n**Operations in lead-up to collapse**\n\nIn the years leading up to its collapse, SVB continued to grow and expand its operations. The bank's total assets increased from $100 billion in 2019 to over $200 billion in 2022. However, the bank's financial situation began to deteriorate in 2022, as the technology industry experienced a downturn and the bank's asset values declined.\n\n**Business model**\n\nSVB's business model was focused on providing specialized financial services to technology and life science companies. The bank's founders recognized the need for a bank that could provide expert financial advice and tailored financial solutions to these companies, and they set out to create a bank that could meet this need.\n\nSVB's business model was based on the following key components:\n\n* **Credit lines**: SVB provided credit lines to technology companies, allowing them to access the capital they needed to grow and succeed.\n* **Investment products**: The bank offered a range of investment products, including stocks, bonds, and mutual funds, to help its customers grow their wealth.\n* **Venture capital**: SVB's venture capital arm invested in early-stage technology companies, providing them with the capital they needed to develop and launch their products.\n* **Online banking**: The bank's online banking platform provided customers with a convenient and secure way to access their accounts and conduct financial transactions.\n\n**Facilities**\n\nSVB had a number of facilities that supported its operations. The bank's headquarters was located in Santa Clara, California, and it had branches in other parts of California and in other states. SVB also had a number of specialized facilities, including:\n\n* **Data center**: The bank's data center was a state-of-the-art facility that housed its computer systems and provided secure storage for its data.\n* **Secure operations center**: The bank's secure operations center was a facility that provided 24/7 monitoring and support for its systems and operations.\n* **Training center**: SVB's training center provided training and development programs for its employees, helping them to develop the skills and knowledge they needed to succeed in their roles.\n\n**Affiliations and community involvement**\n\nSVB was affiliated with a number of organizations and was involved in a number of community activities. The bank was a member of the following organizations:\n\n* **American Bankers Association**: SVB was a member of the American Bankers Association, which provided it with access to industry research, training, and advocacy.\n* **California Bankers Association**: The bank was a member of the California Bankers Association, which provided it with access to state-specific research, training, and advocacy.\n* **Silicon Valley Chamber of Commerce**: SVB was a member of the Silicon Valley Chamber of Commerce, which provided it with access to local business leaders and community events.\n\nThe bank was also involved in a number of community activities, including:\n\n* **Charitable giving**: SVB was a major supporter of charitable causes, including education, healthcare, and the arts.\n* **Volunteer programs**: The bank had a number of volunteer programs that allowed its employees to give back to the community.\n* **Community events**: SVB hosted a number of community events, including workshops, seminars, and networking receptions.\n\n**Collapse**\n\nIn March 2023, SVB announced that it would be closing its doors and ceasing all operations. The bank's collapse was the result of a combination of factors, including a decline in asset values, a decrease in deposits, and an increase in loan losses.\n\nThe collapse of SVB was a major blow to the technology and life science industries, which had come to rely on the bank for financial services. The bank's failure also had a significant impact on the broader economy, as it led to a loss of confidence in the financial system and a decrease in economic activity.\n\n**References**\n\nThis article does not include any references, as the information is based on publicly available sources and the author's own research.\n\n**Further reading**\n\nFor further information on Silicon Valley Bank, please see the following sources:\n\n* **SVB website**: The official website of Silicon Valley Bank provides information on the bank's history, products, and services.\n* **Wikipedia articles**: Other Wikipedia articles on Silicon Valley Bank provide additional information on the bank's history, operations, and collapse.\n* **News articles**: News articles on the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank provide additional information on the bank's financial situation and the impact of its collapse on the technology and life science industries.\n\n**External links**\n\n* **SVB website**: The official website of Silicon Valley Bank provides information on the bank's history, products, and services.\n* **American Bankers Association**: The website of the American Bankers Association provides information on the bank's membership and involvement in the organization.\n* **California Bankers Association**: The website of the California Bankers Association provides information on the bank's membership and involvement in the organization.\n* **Silicon Valley Chamber of Commerce**: The website of the Silicon Valley Chamber of Commerce provides information on the bank's membership and involvement in the organization.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The Romans inherited many medical practices from their predecessors, the Etruscans and Greeks, and made significant contributions of their own. Roman surgery was characterized by its use of a wide range of tools, techniques, and procedures, many of which are still studied and practiced today.\n\n**History**\n\nThe history of surgery in ancient Rome is closely tied to the development of medicine as a whole. The earliest Roman medical texts, such as the _Hippocratic Corpus_, date back to the 5th century BCE. However, it wasn't until the 1st century BCE that Roman medicine began to take on a more formalized structure. The _Asclepiades_ of Rome, a school of medicine founded by Asclepiades of Tralles, emphasized the importance of empirical observation and experimentation in medical practice.\n\nThe Roman Empire's expansion and conquests brought about a significant increase in the availability of medical knowledge and expertise. Roman physicians, such as Galen and Rufus of Ephesus, traveled extensively throughout the empire, sharing their knowledge and learning from other cultures. The construction of hospitals and medical schools also became more widespread during this period.\n\n**Tools**\n\nRoman surgeons relied on a wide range of tools to perform various procedures. Some of the most common tools used in ancient Roman surgery include:\n\n### **Cupping vessels**\n\nCupping vessels, also known as _unciae_, were used to apply suction to the skin. They consisted of small, bell-shaped bowls made of clay or metal that were heated and then applied to the skin, creating a vacuum. Cupping was used to treat a variety of ailments, including headaches, fever, and congestion.\n\n### **Chisels and raspatories**\n\nChisels and raspatories were used to remove bone and other hard tissues. Chisels, also known as _scalprum_, were small, handheld tools with a sharp edge, while raspatories, or _raspatum_, were larger, more robust instruments used to smooth out rough surfaces.\n\n### **Drills and levers**\n\nDrills, or _chora_, were used to make holes in bone and other hard tissues. Levers, or _fistula_, were used to apply force and manipulate tissues.\n\n### **Saws and trephines**\n\nSaws, or _serra_, were used to cut through bone and other hard tissues. Trephines, or _trepanum_, were used to remove circular sections of bone, often to relieve pressure on the brain.\n\n### **Forceps**\n\nForceps, or _forcipes_, were used to grasp and manipulate tissues. They were often used in conjunction with other instruments, such as scalpels or chisels.\n\n### **Probes and curettes**\n\nProbes, or _probos_, were used to examine the interior of the body, while curettes, or _curetta_, were used to remove soft tissues.\n\n### **Scalpels**\n\nScalpels, or _scalprum_, were used to make incisions in the skin. They were often used in conjunction with other instruments, such as forceps or chisels.\n\n### **Specula**\n\nSpecula, or _speculum_, were used to examine the interior of the body. They were often used to examine the throat, vagina, or rectum.\n\n### **Spoon of Diocles**\n\nThe spoon of Diocles, or _ligula Diocli_, was a surgical instrument used to apply pressure and manipulate tissues. It was often used in conjunction with other instruments, such as forceps or scalpels.\n\n### **Catheters**\n\nCatheters, or _catheter_, were used to drain fluids from the body. They were often used in conjunction with other instruments, such as forceps or scalpels.\n\n### **Strigils**\n\nStrigils, or _strigilis_, were used to remove hair and other unwanted substances from the skin.\n\n### **Knives and needles**\n\nKnives, or _stilus_, were used to make incisions in the skin. Needles, or _acus_, were used to inject substances into the body.\n\n### **Hooks**\n\nHooks, or _fistula_, were used to grasp and manipulate tissues.\n\n### **Other tools**\n\nOther tools used in ancient Roman surgery included the _mola_, a mortar used to grind and mix substances, and the _capsula_, a container used to store and transport instruments.\n\n**Techniques**\n\nRoman surgeons employed a wide range of techniques to treat various ailments. Some of the most common techniques used in ancient Roman surgery include:\n\n### **Abortion**\n\nAbortion was a common procedure in ancient Roman medicine. It was often performed using herbal remedies or other substances to induce miscarriage.\n\n### **Amputations and dissections**\n\nAmputations and dissections were used to treat a variety of ailments, including gangrene and infection. Surgeons would often use instruments, such as chisels and saws, to remove infected tissue.\n\n### **Bloodletting**\n\nBloodletting was a common procedure in ancient Roman medicine. It was believed to balance the body's \"humors\" and was often used to treat a variety of ailments, including fever and headache.\n\n### **Caesarean section**\n\nCaesarean section was a rare but sometimes necessary procedure in ancient Roman medicine. It was often performed to save the life of the mother or the baby.\n\n### **Cataract surgery**\n\nCataract surgery was a common procedure in ancient Roman medicine. Surgeons would often use instruments, such as forceps and scalpels, to remove the cloudy lens of the eye.\n\n### **Cosmetic surgery**\n\nCosmetic surgery was a common practice in ancient Roman medicine. Surgeons would often use instruments, such as forceps and scalpels, to remove excess skin or tissue.\n\n### **Hernia treatment**\n\nHernia treatment was a common procedure in ancient Roman medicine. Surgeons would often use instruments, such as forceps and scalpels, to repair the hernia.\n\n### **Lithotomy**\n\nLithotomy was a procedure used to remove kidney stones. Surgeons would often use instruments, such as forceps and scalpels, to remove the stone.\n\n### **Neurosurgery**\n\nNeurosurgery was a rare but sometimes necessary procedure in ancient Roman medicine. Surgeons would often use instruments, such as forceps and scalpels, to repair damaged tissue or relieve pressure on the brain.\n\n### **Sutures, ligatures, and contractions**\n\nSutures, ligatures, and contractions were used to close wounds and repair damaged tissue. Surgeons would often use instruments, such as forceps and scalpels, to apply the sutures or ligatures.\n\n### **Tonsillectomies and mastectomies**\n\nTonsillectomies and mastectomies were common procedures in ancient Roman medicine. Surgeons would often use instruments, such as forceps and scalpels, to remove the tonsils or breast tissue.\n\n### **Tooth extraction**\n\nTooth extraction was a common procedure in ancient Roman medicine. Surgeons would often use instruments, such as forceps and scalpels, to remove the tooth.\n\n### **Other techniques**\n\nOther techniques used in ancient Roman surgery included the use of herbal remedies and other substances to treat various ailments.\n\n**References**\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n* **Galen**: _On the Natural Faculties_ (trans.

Their presence in Africa dates back to the 8th century BC, with the first historical colonies established in Egypt. This article explores the history and cultural exchange between the ancient Greeks and the African civilizations.\n\n### Introduction\n\nThe African Greeks were a diverse group of people who came to Africa from Greece, either as colonizers, traders, or as part of the vast network of the Mediterranean. Their interactions with the local populations resulted in the development of unique cultural and linguistic identities. Despite the passage of time, the legacy of the African Greeks continues to fascinate historians, archaeologists, and the general public alike.\n\n### Ancient Egypt\n\nThe ancient Greeks arrived in Egypt during the 8th century BC, with the first recorded presence dating back to the reign of Pharaoh Psamtik I (664–610 BC). The Greeks established a series of colonies along the Mediterranean coast, primarily in the Nile Delta region.\n\n#### First Historical Colonies\n\nThe first Greek colony in Egypt was established at Naucratis, a port city on the Nile Delta. This settlement was founded by the Milesian Greeks, who were attracted by the city's strategic location and the availability of fertile land. The colony at Naucratis flourished, and it became an important center of trade and commerce between Egypt and Greece.\n\n#### Hellenistic Times\n\nThe arrival of Alexander the Great in Egypt in 332 BC marked the beginning of a new era in Greek-African interactions. Alexander's conquest of Egypt led to the establishment of the Ptolemaic Empire, which lasted for over 300 years.\n\n#### Rule of Alexander the Great (332–323 BC)\n\nDuring Alexander's reign, the Greeks and Egyptians coexisted peacefully, with the Greek rulers adopting many Egyptian customs and traditions. The Ptolemaic dynasty, founded by Alexander's general Ptolemy I Soter, maintained close ties with Greece and continued the policy of cultural exchange with Egypt.\n\n#### The Ptolemaic Empire (323–30 BC)\n\nThe Ptolemaic Empire was a Greek kingdom that ruled Egypt from 323 to 30 BC. During this period, the Greeks continued to settle in Egypt, and the two cultures merged, resulting in the development of a unique Greek-Egyptian culture. The Ptolemies built many temples and cities, including Alexandria, which became a major center of learning and culture.\n\n#### Roman and Byzantine Egypt\n\nWith the rise of the Roman Empire, Egypt became a Roman province, and the Greek population continued to thrive. The Romans introduced their own language, laws, and customs, but the Greeks maintained their cultural identity. During the Byzantine period, the Greeks continued to play a significant role in Egyptian society.\n\n#### Coptic Greeks\n\nThe Coptic Greeks were a group of Christians who lived in Egypt during the Byzantine period. They were predominantly Greek-speaking and maintained their cultural and linguistic identity despite the Arab conquest of Egypt in the 7th century AD.\n\n### Ancient Ethiopia\n\nThe ancient Greeks had a significant presence in Ethiopia, primarily in the Axumite Empire.\n\n#### Axumites of Ethiopia\n\nThe Axumite Empire was a powerful and influential kingdom that ruled Ethiopia from the 4th to the 8th century AD. The Axumites had close ties with the Greeks, and many Greek traders and colonizers settled in Ethiopia.\n\n#### Abyssinian Greeks\n\nThe Abyssinian Greeks were a group of people who lived in Ethiopia during the medieval period. They were predominantly Greek-speaking and maintained their cultural and linguistic identity.\n\n### Ancient Libya\n\nThe ancient Greeks had a significant presence in Libya, primarily in the region of Cyrenaica.\n\n#### Libyan Greeks of Cyrenaica\n\nThe Libyan Greeks were a group of people who lived in Cyrenaica, a region in northwestern Libya. They were predominantly Greek-speaking and maintained their cultural and linguistic identity.\n\n#### Libyan Greek culture\n\nThe Libyan Greek culture was a unique blend of Greek and indigenous Libyan traditions. The Greeks introduced their language, customs, and traditions to the region, while the Libyans retained their own distinct cultural identity.\n\n### Ancient Nubia\n\nThe ancient Greeks had a significant presence in Nubia, primarily in the region of Kush.\n\n#### Axumite subjugation of Nubia\n\nThe Axumites of Ethiopia conquered Nubia in the 4th century AD, and the region became a vassal state of the Axumite Empire. The Greeks continued to play a significant role in Nubian society.\n\n#### Nubian Greeks\n\nThe Nubian Greeks were a group of people who lived in Nubia during the medieval period. They were predominantly Greek-speaking and maintained their cultural and linguistic identity.\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nThe African Greeks were a diverse group of people who came to Africa from Greece, either as colonizers, traders, or as part of the vast network of the Mediterranean. Their interactions with the local populations resulted in the development of unique cultural and linguistic identities. Despite the passage of time, the legacy of the African Greeks continues to fascinate historians, archaeologists, and the general public alike.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The film is based on the iconic Barbie doll franchise created by Mattel. The movie stars Margot Robbie as Barbie, a perfect and popular doll who lives in a world of fantasy, and Ryan Gosling as Ken, her on-again, off-again boyfriend. The film also features an ensemble cast, including America Ferrera, Kate McKinnon, Issa Rae, and Will Ferrell.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film follows Barbie (Margot Robbie), a perfect and popular doll who lives in a world of fantasy, where everything is perfect and beautiful. Barbie's life is turned upside down when she is expelled from her perfect world and forced to navigate the real world, where she meets a diverse group of women who challenge her perceptions and help her discover her true identity. Along the way, Barbie meets Ken (Ryan Gosling), her on-again, off-again boyfriend, who is struggling to find his place in the world.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Margot Robbie as Barbie\n* Ryan Gosling as Ken\n* America Ferrera as Gloria\n* Kate McKinnon as Allen\n* Issa Rae as Queens\n* Will Ferrell as CEO of Mattel\n* Simu Liu as Ken's brother\n* Alexandra Shipp as Ken's girlfriend\n* Ritu Arya as Ken's sister\n* Michael Cera as Ken's coworker\n* Rafaëlle Cohen as Ken's boss\n\n**Production**\n\n#### Development\n\nThe idea for the film was first conceived in 2014, when Mattel approached Warner Bros.

Gerwig has stated that she was drawn to the project because of its potential to explore themes of identity, feminism, and self-discovery.\n\n#### Writing\n\nGerwig wrote the screenplay for the film, with Noah Baumbach serving as a co-writer.

Despite the risks associated with serving as a federal judge, the vast majority of judges have served their terms without incident. However, there have been instances where judges have died while still serving on the bench, often due to natural causes or accidents.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe federal judiciary in the United States is composed of three branches: the Supreme Court, the Courts of Appeals, and the District Courts. Federal judges are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate to serve for life, subject to impeachment and removal. As a result, federal judges are often older and more established in their careers, which can increase the risk of health-related issues and accidents.\n\n**Political consequences**\n\nThe death of a federal judge in active service can have significant political consequences, particularly if the vacancy occurs during a time of great importance or during a presidential election year. The most notable example is the death of Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes in 1948, which led to the appointment of Fred M. Vinson as his successor. Vinson's appointment was seen as a compromise between the liberal and conservative blocs within the Court, and his tenure was marked by significant changes in the Court's jurisprudence.\n\nIn other cases, the death of a federal judge can lead to a partisan battle over the appointment of a successor. For example, the death of Judge Robert Bork in 2012 led to a heated debate over his successor, with some conservative groups pushing for the appointment of a like-minded judge. Similarly, the death of Judge Thurgood Marshall in 1993 led to a contentious nomination process for his successor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\n\n**Logistical consequences**\n\nThe death of a federal judge in active service can also have logistical consequences, particularly if the judge was in the midst of a high-profile case or was serving on a critical committee. In such cases, the court may need to appoint a temporary judge or recess until a permanent replacement can be appointed. For example, the death of Judge Antonin Scalia in 2016 led to a contentious debate over his replacement, with some arguing that the Court should recess until a new judge could be appointed.\n\nIn other cases, the death of a federal judge can lead to changes in the court's operations, such as the appointment of a new chief judge or the reassignment of cases. For example, the death of Chief Judge Edward Chen in 2013 led to the appointment of a new chief judge, who oversaw significant changes in the court's operations.\n\n**Lists**\n\n### 1789–1869\n\nThe following is a list of federal judges who died while in active service during this period:\n\n* John Jay (1789–1795): Died of a stroke on May 17, 1795, at the age of 68.\n* William Cushing (1789–1810): Died of a stroke on September 13, 1810, at the age of 78.\n* James Wilson (1789–1798): Died of a stroke on August 21, 1798, at the age of 56.\n* John Rutledge (1789–1795): Died of a stroke on March 23, 1800, at the age of 54.\n* William Paterson (1793–1806): Died of a stroke on September 12, 1806, at the age of 63.\n* Samuel Chase (1796–1811): Died of a stroke on June 19, 1811, at the age of 72.\n* Bushrod Washington (1798–1829): Died of a stroke on November 26, 1829, at the age of 67.\n* Gabriel Duvall (1795–1835): Died of a stroke on May 14, 1844, at the age of 82.\n\n### 1870–1919\n\nThe following is a list of federal judges who died while in active service during this period:\n\n* Ward Hunt (1872–1882): Died of a stroke on September 14, 1882, at the age of 57.\n* Joseph Bradley (1870–1892): Died of a stroke on January 22, 1892, at the age of 73.\n* John McCunn (1873–1890): Died of a stroke on January 15, 1890, at the age of 59.\n* Samuel Blatchford (1882–1893): Died of a stroke on July 7, 1893, at the age of 67.\n* William Woods (1889–1922): Died of a stroke on May 14, 1922, at the age of 83.\n* Roscoe Conkling (1873–1886): Died of a stroke on April 18, 1886, at the age of 63.\n\n### 1920–1954\n\nThe following is a list of federal judges who died while in active service during this period:\n\n* William Howard Taft (1921–1930): Died of a stroke on March 8, 1930, at the age of 73.\n* Louis Brandeis (1916–1939): Died of a heart attack on October 5, 1941, at the age of 82.\n* Harlan F.

The song's lyrics explore themes of mortality and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on society. The second single, \"United in Grief,\" was released in May 2022 and features a more upbeat and celebratory tone. The song's lyrics touch on themes of unity and collective grief.\n\n## Tour\n\nKendrick Lamar has not announced a full-scale tour in support of the album, but he has hinted at a possible tour in the future. In a 2022 interview with Rolling Stone, he mentioned that he was working on a new live show that would feature a mix of old and new material.\n\n# Critical Reception\n\n## Year-end Lists\n\nMr. Morale & the Big Steppers has been widely praised by critics, with many considering it one of the best albums of 2022.

The project has been active several times since its inception, with each iteration featuring significant changes and updates.\n\nIntroduction\n------------\n\nR/place is an experiment in collaborative art and social interaction, allowing users to contribute to a shared canvas in real-time. The project's concept is simple: users can change the color of individual pixels on a grid, creating a constantly evolving work of art. However, the rules and mechanics of the project are complex, and its outcomes are often unpredictable.\n\nOverview\n--------\n\nR/place is a community-driven project that has been hosted on Reddit several times since its inception. Each iteration features a shared canvas, a grid of pixels that users can modify by changing their color. The project's rules are simple: users can change the color of individual pixels, and their changes are immediately visible to all other users. However, the project's dynamics are complex, and the interactions between users can be influenced by a variety of factors, including the platform's algorithms and the community's behavior.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n### 2017 experiment\n\nThe first iteration of R/place was hosted on Reddit in April 2017. The project was created by a team of Reddit administrators, who aimed to create a platform for users to collaborate on a shared artwork. The project's canvas was a 1000x1000 grid of pixels, which users could modify by clicking on individual pixels and selecting a new color. The project was an instant success, with thousands of users contributing to the canvas and creating a wide range of artworks.\n\nThe 2017 iteration of R/place was marked by a series of unexpected events, including the emergence of a global \"flag\" image, which became a symbol of the project. The flag was created by a group of users who worked together to create a massive image of the flag on the canvas. The image was so large and prominent that it became a defining feature of the project, and it was widely shared and discussed on social media.\n\n### 2022 experiment\n\nIn February 2022, Reddit hosted a second iteration of R/place. The project's canvas was increased to 2000x2000 pixels, and the project's rules were modified to allow users to create and share their own \"skins\" – custom designs that could be applied to the canvas. The 2022 iteration of R/place was marked by a series of new features and updates, including the introduction of a \"history\" feature, which allowed users to view past versions of the canvas.\n\nThe 2022 iteration of R/place was also marked by a series of conflicts and controversies, including a dispute over the use of \"hate speech\" on the canvas. The dispute was fueled by a group of users who claimed that the platform was allowing hate speech and harassment to occur on the canvas. The controversy was widely reported in the media, and it led to a series of changes to the project's rules and moderation policies.\n\n### 2023 experiment\n\nIn March 2023, Reddit hosted a third iteration of R/place. The project's canvas was increased to 3000x3000 pixels, and the project's rules were modified to allow users to create and share their own \"art packs\" – collections of custom designs that could be applied to the canvas. The 2023 iteration of R/place was marked by a series of new features and updates, including the introduction of a \"block\" feature, which allowed users to block other users from modifying the canvas.\n\nThe 2023 iteration of R/place was also marked by a series of changes to the project's moderation policies, including the introduction of a new \"trust level\" system, which allowed users to earn rewards and privileges for contributing to the project.\n\nMedia response\n-------------\n\nR/place has received widespread media attention since its inception. In 2017, the project was featured in a number of major news outlets, including The New York Times, The Guardian, and CNN. The project's flag image was widely shared and discussed on social media, and it became a symbol of the project.\n\nIn 2022, the project's controversy over hate speech and harassment was widely reported in the media, and it led to a series of changes to the project's rules and moderation policies. In 2023, the project's new features and updates were widely reported in the media, and they were seen as a major step forward for the project.\n\nAtlas\n------\n\nR/place's atlas is a visual representation of the project's history and evolution. The atlas is a collection of images that show the project's canvas at different points in time, and it provides a unique insight into the project's dynamics and interactions.\n\nThe atlas is divided into a number of different sections, each of which represents a different era or iteration of the project. The sections are organized chronologically, and they provide a clear and concise overview of the project's history.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Reddit\n* Social media\n* Collaborative art\n* Pixel art\n* User-generated content\n* Online communities\n\nExternal links\n--------------\n\n* R/place on Reddit\n* R/place Atlas\n* Reddit's community guidelines\n* Reddit's moderation policies", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

It is based on the DC Comics character of the same name and serves as a reboot of the Batman film series. The film stars Robert Pattinson as Bruce Wayne/Batman, Zoë Kravitz as Selina Kyle/Catwoman, Jeffrey Wright as James Gordon, and Paul Dano as the Riddler. The movie follows Batman as he investigates a series of murders in Gotham City, which are committed by a serial killer known as the Riddler.\n\n# Plot\n\nThe film begins with a young Bruce Wayne (played by twins Max and Charlie Carver) witnessing his parents' murder at the hands of a mugger, Joe Chill. This event sets Bruce on a path to become the vigilante known as Batman. The film then cuts to the present day, where we see Bruce Wayne (played by Robert Pattinson) as a billionaire philanthropist, but also as a troubled individual struggling to come to terms with his past.\n\nAs the Riddler begins to commit a series of murders in Gotham City, Batman becomes obsessed with catching him, but his methods become increasingly erratic and violent. Meanwhile, Selina Kyle, a cat burglar, becomes embroiled in Batman's investigation, and the two form an uneasy alliance. Commissioner James Gordon, a corrupt and incompetent cop, is also drawn into the investigation, but his loyalties are torn between his duty to the law and his admiration for the Riddler's intelligence.\n\nAs the body count rises, Batman becomes more and more unhinged, and his relationship with Selina begins to fray. The Riddler, meanwhile, reveals himself to be a clever and charismatic figure, who is using his murders to expose the corruption and decay of Gotham City. The film culminates in a showdown between Batman and the Riddler, which ends in a tragic and unexpected twist.\n\n# Cast\n\nRobert Pattinson as Bruce Wayne/Batman\nZoë Kravitz as Selina Kyle/Catwoman\nJeffrey Wright as James Gordon\nPaul Dano as the Riddler\nAndy Serkis as Alfred Pennyworth\nColin Farrell as Oswald Cobblepot/The Penguin\nJohn Turturro as Carmine Falcone\nPeter Sarsgaard as Gil Colson\nJayme Lawson as Maya\nBarry Keoghan as Dekker\nRitchie Coster as Solomon Grundy\nGenevieve O'Reilly as Jessica Cruz\nEd DeBeck as Riddler's father\n\n# Production\n\n## Development\n\n### Early work and initial plans from Ben Affleck\n\nThe idea for a new Batman film began in 2014, when Warner Bros. announced plans for a new Batman film, with Ben Affleck set to star and direct. Affleck's vision for the film was to create a gritty and realistic take on the character, drawing inspiration from the graphic novel \"The Dark Knight Returns\" by Frank Miller. However, the project stalled due to creative differences between Affleck and the studio.\n\n### Redevelopment under Matt Reeves\n\nIn 2017, Warner Bros. announced that Matt Reeves would take over the project, with Robert Pattinson set to star as Batman. Reeves' vision for the film was to create a character-driven story that explored the complexities of Batman's psyche. He drew inspiration from the character's comics, as well as from films like \"Taxi Driver\" and \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\".\n\n## Writing\n\nThe screenplay for the film was written by Matt Reeves and Peter Craig. Reeves has stated that he was drawn to the character of Batman because of his ability to be a symbol of hope in a dark and corrupt world. He wanted to explore the character's emotional vulnerability, and to create a story that was both personal and epic in scope.\n\n## Casting\n\nThe casting process for the film was a long and intricate one. Robert Pattinson was initially hesitant to take on the role of Batman, but eventually came on board after being convinced by Reeves' vision for the film. Zoë Kravitz was cast as Selina Kyle/Catwoman, and Jeffrey Wright was cast as James Gordon.\n\n## Design\n\n### Sets and props\n\nThe production design for the film was led by Greig Fraser, who created a visually stunning and immersive world that was both grounded in reality and fantastical in scope. The sets were built to be as realistic as possible, with a focus on creating a sense of texture and atmosphere.\n\n### Batsuit\n\nThe Batsuit was designed by Ryan Corbet, who drew inspiration from the character's comics, as well as from films like \"The Dark Knight\" and \"The Avengers\". The suit was created using a combination of practical and CGI effects, and was designed to be as functional as possible.\n\n### Other costumes\n\nThe other costumes in the film were designed by Jacqueline Durran, who created a range of visually stunning and intricate outfits for the characters. The costumes were inspired by the character's comics, as well as from films like \"The Great Gatsby\" and \"The Grand Budapest Hotel\".\n\n## Filming\n\n### Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the production of the film, with filming being delayed and rescheduled multiple times. The cast and crew had to undergo regular testing and follow strict safety protocols to minimize the risk of infection.\n\n## Editing\n\nThe editing of the film was led by William Hoy, who worked closely with Reeves to create a seamless and cohesive narrative. The film's pacing was carefully calibrated to create a sense of tension and urgency, with a focus on building towards the film's dramatic conclusion.\n\n## Visual effects\n\nThe visual effects for the film were created by Weta Digital, who used a combination of CGI and live-action footage to bring the film's fantastical elements to life.

Initially designed for revenue service, the locomotive went on to become a beloved tourist attraction and an icon of American railroading.\n\n**Design and Abilities**\n\nThe Norfolk and Western 611 is a class J-class 4-8-4 articulated steam locomotive, capable of producing 4,500 horsepower. The locomotive features a streamline design, with a concave nose and a long, tapered hood. The 611's unique design provides exceptional high-speed capabilities, making it well-suited for mainline excursion service.\n\nThe locomotive's 4-8-4 configuration features a leading set of drivers, followed by a group of driving wheels, and trailing wheels. This configuration allows for a high degree of power and flexibility, making it ideal for hauling heavy loads over long distances. The 611's articulated design also provides improved traction and stability, allowing the locomotive to navigate tight curves and steep grades with ease.\n\nIn addition to its impressive size and power, the 611 features a number of advanced technologies for its time. The locomotive is equipped with a high-pressure boiler, which allows for greater efficiency and power output. The boiler is also equipped with a superheater, which helps to increase the temperature of the steam and improve overall efficiency.\n\nThe 611's cab is designed to provide a comfortable and safe working environment for the engineer and fireman. The cab features a spacious interior, with ample room for the crew to move about and monitor the locomotive's systems. The cab is also equipped with a number of advanced features, including a steam gauge, a pressure gauge, and a reversing valve.\n\n**History**\n\nThe Norfolk and Western 611 was built in 1950, during a period of significant growth and expansion for the Norfolk and Western Railway. The locomotive was designed to haul heavy loads over long distances, and was intended for use on the railway's mainline routes.\n\n### Revenue Service\n\nThe 611 began its revenue service career in 1950, hauling passenger and freight trains over the Norfolk and Western Railway's mainline routes. The locomotive quickly gained a reputation for its exceptional speed and power, and became a favorite among railroad crews.\n\nDuring its revenue service career, the 611 hauled a number of notable trains, including the Powhatan Arrow and the Cavalier. The locomotive also played a role in several major rail events, including the 1951 Easter Parade and the 1952 Virginia State Fair.\n\n### First Retirement\n\nIn 1959, the Norfolk and Western Railway announced that it would be retiring the 611, along with several other steam locomotives, due to the increasing popularity of diesel and electric locomotives. The locomotive was placed in storage at the Roanoke Shops, where it remained for several years.\n\n### First Mainline Excursion Service\n\nIn 1962, the 611 was leased to the Virginian Railway for use on a series of mainline excursions. The locomotive was restored to operating condition and began hauling passenger trains over the Virginian Railway's mainline routes.\n\nThe 611's first mainline excursion service was a huge success, with thousands of passengers traveling on the locomotive's inaugural runs. The locomotive's iconic design and exceptional power made it a beloved sight among railfans and tourists alike.\n\n### Second Retirement\n\nIn 1967, the Norfolk and Western Railway announced that it would be retiring the 611 for a second time, citing the increasing cost of maintaining the locomotive and the growing popularity of diesel and electric locomotives.\n\n### Second Mainline Excursion Service\n\nIn 1975, the 611 was leased to the Norfolk Southern Railway for use on a series of mainline excursions. The locomotive was restored to operating condition and began hauling passenger trains over the Norfolk Southern Railway's mainline routes.\n\nThe 611's second mainline excursion service was also a huge success, with thousands of passengers traveling on the locomotive's inaugural runs. The locomotive's iconic design and exceptional power made it a beloved sight among railfans and tourists alike.\n\n### Post-NS Excursion Service\n\nIn 1994, the Norfolk and Western Railway announced that it would be retiring the 611 for a third and final time. The locomotive was placed in storage at the Roanoke Shops, where it remained for several years.\n\nIn 2003, the 611 was sold to the Norfolk Southern Railway, which began to restore the locomotive to operating condition. The locomotive began hauling passenger trains on a series of post-NS excursion services, including the Virginian Railway's Norfolk Southern Heritage excursion.\n\nThe 611's post-NS excursion service was a huge success, with thousands of passengers traveling on the locomotive's inaugural runs. The locomotive's iconic design and exceptional power made it a beloved sight among railfans and tourists alike.\n\n**Accidents and Incidents**\n\nThe Norfolk and Western 611 has been involved in several accidents and incidents throughout its history. In 1951, the locomotive was involved in a head-on collision with a freight train, resulting in significant damage to the locomotive's leading set of drivers.\n\nIn 1962, the locomotive was involved in a derailment while hauling a passenger train over the Virginian Railway's mainline routes. The locomotive sustained significant damage, but was repaired and returned to service.\n\nIn 1975, the locomotive was involved in a collision with a maintenance train, resulting in significant damage to the locomotive's trailing set of drivers.\n\n**In Popular Culture**\n\nThe Norfolk and Western 611 has been featured in several films, television shows, and books throughout its history. The locomotive has been depicted in films such as \"The Great Locomotive Chase\" and \"The Last Steam Locomotive.\"\n\nThe locomotive has also been featured in several television shows, including \"The Railroaders\" and \"The Train.\"\n\nThe locomotive has been written about in several books, including \"The Great Locomotive Chase\" and \"The Last Steam Locomotive.\"\n\n**See also**\n\n* Norfolk and Western Railway\n* Virginian Railway\n* Norfolk Southern Railway\n* Steam locomotive\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The Norfolk and Western 611 is a historic steam locomotive built by the Norfolk and Western Railway's Roanoke Shops in 1950.\n* The locomotive was designed to haul heavy loads over long distances and was intended for use on the railway's mainline routes.\n* The locomotive has been involved in several accidents and incidents throughout its history, including a head-on collision and a derailment.\n* The locomotive has been featured in several films, television shows, and books throughout its history.\n* The locomotive is currently on display at the Virginia Museum of Transportation in Roanoke, Virginia.\n\n**References**\n\n* \"The Great Locomotive Chase\" by Henry G.
