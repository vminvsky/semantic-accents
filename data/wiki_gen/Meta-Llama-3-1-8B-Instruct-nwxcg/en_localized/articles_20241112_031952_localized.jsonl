This article explores the history of women's cinema, from the silent era to the present day, and examines the impact of women's filmmaking on society.\n\n**Famous Women in Film History**\n\nSeveral women have made significant contributions to the history of cinema. Some notable examples include:\n\n### **Silent Films**\n\nDuring the silent era, women such as Lois Weber and Alice Guy-Blaché were prominent filmmakers. Weber, an American, directed over 50 films between 1904 and 1916, while Guy-Blaché, a Frenchwoman, directed over 200 films between 1896 and 1925. Both women were pioneers in the industry, breaking down barriers for women in filmmaking.\n\n### **Classical Hollywood**\n\nIn the classical Hollywood era, women such as Barbara Stanwyck and Greer Garson became stars of the silver screen. Stanwyck, an American, appeared in over 80 films between 1929 and 1969, while Garson, a Canadian, starred in 34 films between 1935 and 1972. Both women were known for their versatility and talent.\n\n### **Experimental and Avant-Garde Cinema**\n\nWomen such as Maya Deren and Agnès Varda have made significant contributions to experimental and avant-garde cinema. Deren, an American, directed several short films and documentaries between 1942 and 1960, while Varda, a Frenchwoman, directed over 40 films between 1953 and 2013. Both women were known for pushing the boundaries of traditional filmmaking.\n\n**Impact on Society**\n\nWomen's cinema has had a significant impact on society, from the early days of filmmaking to the present day.\n\n### **Impact of Second-Wave Feminism**\n\nThe second-wave feminist movement of the 1960s and 1970s led to a surge in women's filmmaking. Women such as Susan Seidelman and Sally Potter began to make films that explored feminist themes and issues. These films helped to challenge traditional societal norms and paved the way for future generations of women filmmakers.\n\n### **Representing Sexuality**\n\nWomen's cinema has played a significant role in representing sexuality on screen. Films such as Jean Genet's _Un Chant d'Amour_ (1950) and Varda's _Vagabond_ (1985) explored themes of desire, identity, and sexuality. These films helped to challenge traditional notions of representation and pushed the boundaries of what was considered acceptable on screen.\n\n### **Fear of Entering Cinematography**\n\nHistorically, women have faced significant barriers to entering the film industry. Women such as Weber and Guy-Blaché faced sexism and misogyny, making it difficult for them to succeed. These barriers continue to exist today, with women facing challenges such as underfunding, lack of opportunities, and sexism.\n\n### **Statistics**\n\nAccording to the Hollywood Reporter, in 2020, women made up only 17% of directors, 13% of writers, and 12% of producers in the film industry. These statistics highlight the ongoing struggle for women's representation in the industry.\n\n### **Documentaries**\n\nDocumentaries have played a significant role in women's cinema, providing a platform for women to tell their stories and explore social justice issues. Films such as _The Thin Blue Line_ (1988) and _The Cove_ (2009) have won Academy Awards and highlighted the importance of documentary filmmaking.\n\n### **Female Filmmakers as Feminists**\n\nMany women filmmakers have identified as feminists, using their platform to challenge societal norms and push for social change. Women such as Varda and Deren have been vocal about their feminist politics, using their films to explore themes of identity, desire, and equality.\n\n### **Celluloid Ceiling**\n\nThe term \"celluloid ceiling\" refers to the invisible barrier that prevents women from advancing in their careers. This term was coined by the Women's Media Center, highlighting the ongoing struggle for women's representation in the industry.\n\n**North America**\n\nWomen's cinema has a rich history in North America, with notable filmmakers such as Stanwyck and Garson.\n\n### **Canada**\n\nCanadian women such as Garson have made significant contributions to the industry.

The election was marked by a highly contested and polarized campaign, with several notable incidents and controversies surrounding the process.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe 2022 Brazilian general election was the country's 36th presidential election since the end of the monarchy in 1889. The election was held in a context of deep polarization and social unrest, with the country struggling to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic and facing increasing economic and social challenges.\n\n**Electoral system**\n\nBrazil's electoral system is based on a mixed-member proportional representation (MMP) system, where voters cast two separate ballots: one for a presidential candidate and another for a legislative candidate. The presidential candidate who wins a majority of votes in the first round is elected, but if no candidate achieves a majority, the two top candidates compete in a runoff election.\n\n**Voters**\n\nBrazil has over 156 million registered voters, making it one of the largest and most populous democracies in the world. The voting age in Brazil is 16 years old, and citizens are required to register to vote in order to cast a ballot.\n\n**Candidates and political parties**\n\nA total of 11 candidates competed in the presidential election, representing a range of political parties and coalitions. The main candidates were:\n\n* **Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva** (Workers' Party) - served as President of Brazil from 2003 to 2010 and again from 2023\n* **Jair Bolsonaro** (Liberal Party) - current President of Brazil\n* **Ciro Gomes** (Democratic Labor Party) - former Governor of Ceará and former Minister of Finance\n* **Margarita da Silva** (Green Party) - Senator and environmental activist\n* **Soraya Thronicke** (Brazilian Labour Party) - Senator and former Minister of Development, Industry, and Foreign Trade\n\n**Procedure**\n\nThe election process began with the registration of candidates, which was followed by a period of campaigning. The campaign was marked by a series of debates, rallies, and other events, where candidates presented their platforms and policies to voters. On election day, voters cast their ballots in person or by mail, and the votes were counted and reported by the electoral authorities.\n\n**Presidential candidates**\n\n**Candidates in runoff**\n\n* **Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva** (Workers' Party) - won the runoff election with 50.9% of the vote\n* **Jair Bolsonaro** (Liberal Party) - lost the runoff election with 49.1% of the vote\n\n**Candidates not advanced to runoff**\n\n* **Ciro Gomes** (Democratic Labor Party) - finished third with 12.5% of the vote\n* **Margarita da Silva** (Green Party) - finished fourth with 8.5% of the vote\n* **Soraya Thronicke** (Brazilian Labour Party) - finished fifth with 4.2% of the vote\n* **Other candidates** - finished with less than 1% of the vote\n\n**Withdrawn or declined to be candidates**\n\n* **Geraldo Alckmin** (Brazilian Social Democracy Party) - withdrew his candidacy in August 2022\n* **Henrique Meirelles** (Progressive Party) - declined to be a candidate in June 2022\n\n**Coalitions**\n\n* **For the Future of Brazil** (PT, PDT, PSB, PCdoB, and PCB) - a coalition of left-wing parties that supported Lula da Silva's candidacy\n* **Brazil Above All** (PL, Cidadania, and Novo) - a coalition of right-wing parties that supported Bolsonaro's candidacy\n\n**Congress**\n\nThe election was also a contest for seats in the Chamber of Deputies and the Federal Senate. The Chamber of Deputies has 513 members, who are elected by proportional representation for four-year terms. The Federal Senate has 81 members, who are elected by direct popular vote for eight-year terms.\n\n**Campaign**\n\nThe campaign was marked by a series of debates, rallies, and other events, where candidates presented their platforms and policies to voters. The debates were broadcast on television and online, and were watched by millions of people.\n\n**Debates**\n\nThe debates were held in September and October 2022, and were broadcast on television and online. The debates were moderated by a panel of journalists and focused on topics such as the economy, education, healthcare, and national security.\n\n**Incidents**\n\nThe campaign was marked by several incidents, including:\n\n* **Political violence** - several candidates and their supporters were attacked or threatened with violence.\n* **Disinformation** - several candidates and their supporters spread false or misleading information about their opponents.\n* **Electoral fraud allegations** - several candidates and their supporters accused their opponents of electoral fraud.\n\n**Notable cases**\n\n#### June–August\n\n* **Geraldo Alckmin** (Brazilian Social Democracy Party) - withdrew his candidacy in August 2022 after allegations of electoral fraud.\n* **Henrique Meirelles** (Progressive Party) - declined to be a candidate in June 2022 after allegations of corruption.\n\n#### September–October\n\n* **Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva** (Workers' Party) - was accused of electoral fraud by his opponent, Jair Bolsonaro.\n* **Jair Bolsonaro** (Liberal Party) - was accused of spreading false or misleading information about his opponent, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.\n\n**Disinformation**\n\nSeveral candidates and their supporters spread false or misleading information about their opponents during the campaign.

On March 10, 2023, the bank announced that it would be sold after experiencing a significant loss in value, making it one of the largest bank failures in U.S. history. In this article, we will explore the background of the bank, the events leading to its collapse, and the subsequent effects on its customers, shareholders, the financial system, and the debate over government intervention.\n\n**Background**\n\nSilicon Valley Bank was founded in 1983 as a boutique bank catering to the needs of the technology industry. Over the years, the bank grew rapidly and became a leading provider of financial services to venture capital firms, startups, and established technology companies. By 2023, SVB had become the 16th largest bank in the United States, with over $200 billion in assets.\n\n**Collapse**\n\nThe collapse of SVB began on March 8, 2023, when the bank announced that it would be selling a significant portion of its securities portfolio at a loss. The bank had invested heavily in long-term bonds, which had become less valuable due to rising interest rates. The sale of these securities resulted in a significant loss for the bank, which was estimated to be around $1.8 billion.\n\n##Losses\n\nThe losses suffered by SVB were a result of its portfolio of long-term bonds, which had been invested in anticipation of lower interest rates. However, with the rise of interest rates, the value of these bonds declined, resulting in a significant loss for the bank.\n\n##Instability\n\nThe sale of SVB's securities portfolio at a loss created instability in the bank's financials, leading to concerns about its solvency. The bank's management and board of directors struggled to reassure investors and customers about the bank's financial health.\n\n##Receivership\n\nOn March 10, 2023, the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) placed SVB under receivership, citing a \"systemic risk\" to the financial system. This move effectively nationalized the bank and placed its assets under the control of the FDIC.\n\n##Acquisition\n\nThe FDIC subsequently sold SVB to First Citizens Bank, a regional bank based in North Carolina. The sale was completed on March 29, 2023, and marked the end of SVB's operations as a separate entity.\n\n**Effects**\n\nThe collapse of SVB had significant effects on its customers, shareholders, the financial system, and the debate over government intervention.\n\n##Customers\n\nThe collapse of SVB led to concerns about the safety of deposits at the bank. However, the FDIC insured deposits at SVB up to $250,000, ensuring that customers' deposits were protected. The FDIC also established a process for customers to access their funds and transition their accounts to another bank.\n\n##Shareholders\n\nThe collapse of SVB resulted in significant losses for shareholders, who saw their investment in the bank decline in value. The FDIC's receivership of the bank effectively wiped out shareholder value.\n\n##Financial system\n\nThe collapse of SVB had a significant impact on the financial system, raising concerns about the stability of the banking system. The FDIC's actions to place SVB under receivership and sell it to another bank helped to mitigate these risks.\n\n##Legal actions\n\nThe collapse of SVB also raised questions about the role of regulators and the bank's management in the lead-up to the collapse. The SEC and other regulatory agencies launched investigations into the bank's actions and the actions of its management.\n\n**Reactions**\n\nThe collapse of SVB sparked a range of reactions from officials, experts, and the public.\n\n##Official responses\n\nThe FDIC, the SEC, and other regulatory agencies issued statements expressing concern about the collapse of SVB and the need for vigilance in the financial system. The Treasury Department also issued a statement expressing support for the FDIC's actions.\n\n##Debate over government intervention\n\nThe collapse of SVB sparked a debate about the role of government intervention in the financial system. Some argued that the FDIC's actions were necessary to prevent a broader crisis, while others argued that the government was overstepping its authority.\n\n##Debate about causes\n\nThe collapse of SVB also sparked a debate about the causes of the crisis.

It is the largest of all bears and the largest land carnivore on Earth. Polar bears are well adapted to their Arctic habitat, with a thick layer of fat, a water-repellent coat, and large paws that act as snowshoes.\n\n**Naming**\n\nThe polar bear's scientific name, Ursus maritimus, was coined by the German zoologist Peter Simon Pallas in 1776. The name \"Ursus maritimus\" is derived from the Latin words \"ursus,\" meaning bear, and \"maritimus,\" meaning of the sea. The English name \"polar bear\" has been in use since the 17th century, likely due to the bear's white coloration and its Arctic habitat.\n\n**Taxonomy**\n\nThe polar bear is a member of the family Ursidae, which includes all bears. It is the only species in the genus Ursus maritimus, and is closely related to the brown bear (Ursus arctos). Phylogenetic studies have shown that the polar bear and the brown bear diverged from a common ancestor around 400,000 years ago.\n\n### Evolution\n\nThe evolution of the polar bear is closely tied to the evolution of the Arctic environment. During the Pleistocene epoch, the Arctic region was much colder than it is today, and the sea ice stretched much farther south. The polar bear's ancestors were likely brown bears that migrated to the Arctic region and adapted to the new environment. Over time, these bears evolved to become the large, white, carnivorous mammals we know today.\n\n**Characteristics**\n\nThe polar bear is a large animal, with adult males weighing up to 1,700 pounds (770 kilograms) and reaching lengths of up to 9 feet (2.7 meters). The bear's fur is thick and white, with a layer of fat that can be up to 4 inches (10 centimeters) thick. This fat layer helps to keep the bear warm in the cold Arctic environment. The polar bear's eyes, ears, and nose are black, which helps to absorb heat from the sun.\n\n**Distribution and Habitat**\n\nThe polar bear is found in the Arctic region, including Alaska, Canada, Greenland, Norway, and Russia. The bear's habitat is the sea ice, where it hunts for seals and other prey. The polar bear is a marine mammal, and spends most of its time on the sea ice or in the water.\n\n### Behaviour and Ecology\n\n#### Social Life\n\nPolar bears are generally solitary animals, but they will occasionally gather in large groups to feed on a carcass or to mate. Female polar bears will often care for their cubs for up to two years, during which time they will teach them important survival skills.\n\n#### Diet and Hunting\n\nPolar bears are carnivores, and their primary source of food is the ringed seal (Pusa hispida). The bear will hunt seals by waiting at the edge of a breathing hole in the ice, and then ambushing the seal when it emerges to breathe. The bear will also eat other marine mammals, such as belugas and narwhals, as well as fish and other small animals.\n\n#### Reproduction and Development\n\nPolar bears breed in the spring, and the female will give birth to one or two cubs after a gestation period of around 220 days. The cubs will be born blind and helpless, but will develop quickly, and will be weaned after around six months. The female will care for her cubs for up to two years, during which time they will learn important survival skills.\n\n#### Mortality\n\nPolar bears have a number of natural predators, including orcas and other polar bears. The bear's mortality rate is estimated to be around 10-20% per year, with the main causes of death being starvation, drowning, and hunting by other polar bears.\n\n**Conservation Status**\n\nThe polar bear is listed as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The bear's population is estimated to be around 22,000-31,000 individuals, and is declining due to a number of factors, including climate change, habitat loss, and hunting.\n\n**Relationship with Humans**\n\n### Exploitation\n\nPolar bears have been hunted for their fur and other body parts for centuries. The bear's fur is highly valued, and is often used to make clothing and other textiles. The bear's body parts are also used in traditional medicine, and are believed to have a number of health benefits.\n\n### Conflicts\n\nPolar bears have been known to attack humans in the Arctic region, particularly in areas where the bear's habitat is being encroached upon. The bear will often view humans as a threat, and will defend itself if it feels threatened.\n\n### Captivity\n\nPolar bears have been kept in captivity for a number of years, often in zoos and wildlife parks. However, the bear's complex social and spatial needs make it difficult to keep them in captivity, and many experts argue that it is not in the best interest of the animal to keep them in captivity.\n\n### Cultural Significance\n\nPolar bears have a number of cultural and symbolic meanings in Indigenous cultures. In Inuit culture, the bear is considered a sacred animal, and is often depicted in art and storytelling. The bear is also a symbol of strength and survival, and is often featured in literature and film.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Brown bear\n* Arctic fox\n* Muskox\n* Ringed seal\n* Climate change\n* Habitat loss\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The polar bear is also known as the sea bear.\n* The bear's scientific name, Ursus maritimus, was coined by Peter Simon Pallas in 1776.\n* The polar bear is the largest of all bears, and the largest land carnivore on Earth.\n\n**References**\n\n* This article is written based on the following sources:\n\t+ \"Polar bear\" article on Wikipedia\n\t+ \"Polar bear\" article on National Geographic\n\t+ \"Polar bear\" article on IUCN Red List\n\t+ \"Polar bear\" article on Encyclopedia Britannica\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n* Pallas, P.

He is one of the most important figures of the Western philosophical tradition and a key figure in the transmission of Greek philosophical ideas to the Latin West. Born around 480 AD, Boethius rose to prominence as a diplomat and politician in the court of King Theodoric the Great, but his life took a tragic turn when he was accused of treason and imprisoned. During his imprisonment, he composed some of his most famous works, including the _Consolation of Philosophy_. Despite his untimely death, Boethius' writings had a profound impact on Western philosophy and continue to be studied and admired to this day.\n\n**#Early Life**\n\nBoethius was born into a noble family in Rome around 480 AD. His father was a consul and his mother was a member of the Anicia gens, one of the most prominent families in the Roman Empire. Boethius' early life is not well-documented, but it is known that he received a excellent education in classical literature, philosophy, and law. He was particularly interested in the works of Aristotle and Plato, and he spent many years studying and translating their writings into Latin.\n\n**#Rise to Power**\n\nIn 522 AD, King Theodoric the Great, the ruler of the Ostrogothic Kingdom, appointed Boethius as the Magister Officiorum, or Master of Offices, the highest administrative position in the kingdom. Boethius used this position to promote Greek culture and learning, and he was particularly interested in the spread of Christian theology. He was also a skilled diplomat and played a key role in negotiating alliances with other kingdoms. However, Boethius' rise to power was not without controversy, and he soon found himself at odds with other powerful figures in the court.\n\n**#Downfall and Death**\n\nIn 523 AD, Boethius was accused of treason and imprisoned. The exact circumstances of his downfall are not clear, but it is believed that he was a victim of a plot orchestrated by his rivals in the court. During his imprisonment, Boethius composed some of his most famous works, including the _Consolation of Philosophy_. This work is a masterpiece of philosophical writing and explores the nature of good and evil, fortune and misfortune, and the human condition. Despite his imprisonment, Boethius remained a devout Christian and saw his suffering as an opportunity to reflect on the nature of God and the universe.\n\n**#Major Works**\n\nBoethius' writings had a profound impact on Western philosophy, and his major works continue to be studied and admired today.\n\n##**De consolatione philosophiae**\n\nThe _Consolation of Philosophy_ is Boethius' most famous work and a masterpiece of philosophical writing. It is a dialogue between Boethius and the personification of Philosophy, who guides him through a series of reflections on the nature of good and evil, fortune and misfortune, and the human condition. The work is a powerful expression of Boethius' Christian faith and his commitment to the idea that all human beings are equal in the eyes of God.\n\n##**De topicis differentiis**\n\nThe _De topicis differentiis_ is a philosophical work that explores the nature of truth and the human condition. In this work, Boethius argues that truth is a central concept in philosophy and that it is the foundation of all knowledge. He also explores the idea that human beings are capable of achieving true wisdom and that this is the highest human virtue.\n\n##**De arithmetica**\n\nThe _De arithmetica_ is a mathematical work that explores the nature of numbers and their properties. In this work, Boethius discusses the principles of arithmetic and the use of numbers in mathematics. He also explores the idea that numbers have a deeper symbolic meaning and that they can be used to express philosophical ideas.\n\n##**De institutione musica**\n\nThe _De institutione musica_ is a musical work that explores the nature of music and its properties. In this work, Boethius discusses the principles of music and the use of music in education. He also explores the idea that music has a deeper symbolic meaning and that it can be used to express philosophical ideas.\n\n##**Opuscula sacra**\n\nThe _Opuscula sacra_ is a collection of short philosophical works that explore various aspects of the human condition. In this work, Boethius discusses the nature of God, the universe, and human beings. He also explores the idea that all human beings are equal in the eyes of God and that this is the foundation of Christian morality.\n\n**#Dates of Works**\n\nThe exact dates of Boethius' works are not well-documented, but it is believed that he wrote most of his major works during his imprisonment in 523-524 AD.\n\n**#Legacy**\n\nBoethius' writings had a profound impact on Western philosophy and continue to be studied and admired today. He is particularly important for his contributions to the transmission of Greek philosophical ideas to the Latin West and for his development of the concept of the _via media_, or the middle way, which is a central concept in Christian theology. His works have also been widely translated and have had a profound impact on literature and art.\n\n**#Veneration**\n\nBoethius was venerated as a martyr and a saint in the Middle Ages, and his feast day is celebrated on October 23. He is also remembered as a great scholar and a defender of the faith, and his works continue to be studied and admired today.\n\n**#In Popular Culture**\n\nBoethius has been the subject of numerous works of art and literature, including paintings, sculptures, and musical compositions. He has also been featured in various films and TV shows, including the 1957 film _The Consolation of Philosophy_, which explores his life and works.\n\n**#See Also**\n\n* Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius\n* Consolation of Philosophy\n* De topicis differentiis\n* De arithmetica\n* De institutione musica\n* Opuscula sacra\n* Via media\n* Christian theology\n* Western philosophy\n* Greek philosophy\n* Latin literature\n\n**#Notes**\n\n* This article is based on a variety of sources, including Boethius' own works and the writings of other scholars.\n* The exact dates of Boethius' works are not well-documented, but it is believed that he wrote most of his major works during his imprisonment in 523-524 AD.\n* Boethius' writings had a profound impact on Western philosophy and continue to be studied and admired today.\n\n**#References**\n\n* Sources:\n\t+ Boethius.

The country has a rich history, diverse culture, and a complex geography that has shaped its development over the centuries.\n\n# Etymology and Orthography\n\nThe name \"Ukraine\" is derived from the Old East Slavic word \"ukraina,\" which means \"borderland\" or \"march.\" The term was first used to describe the eastern borders of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in the 13th century. Over time, the name came to be associated with the Kievan Rus', a medieval East Slavic state that emerged in the 9th century.\n\nIn Ukrainian, the language and alphabet used by the majority of the population, the name of the country is written in the Cyrillic script as \"Україна\" (Ukraina). The Latin alphabet is also used, particularly in official contexts and among English speakers.\n\n# History\n\n## Early History\n\nThe earliest known human habitation in Ukraine dates back to the Paleolithic era, with archaeological finds showing that the region was inhabited by various tribes and civilizations over the centuries.

The Golden Age of Kyiv, which lasted from the late 10th to the mid-11th centuries, was marked by significant cultural, economic, and military achievements. The city of Kyiv became a major center of learning, trade, and art, and the Kievan Rus' expanded its territories through military conquests.\n\n## Foreign Domination\n\nIn the 13th century, the Mongols invaded the Kievan Rus', leading to the decline of the medieval state. The Mongols were followed by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which conquered much of Ukraine in the 14th century. In the 16th century, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth absorbed Ukraine, and the country became a major cultural and economic center.\n\n## Cossack Hetmanate\n\nIn the 17th century, the Cossacks, a group of Ukrainian warriors, established the Cossack Hetmanate, a self-governing state that stretched from the Dnieper River to the Black Sea.

Palladio's buildings are characterized by their use of classical elements such as columns, arches, and domes, as well as their emphasis on symmetry and proportion.\n\nPalladio's most famous buildings include the Villa Capra, also known as the Rotonda, and the Teatro Olimpico. The Villa Capra is a country house that was built for the Venetian senator Paolo Almerico, and it is considered one of the most important examples of Palladian architecture. The Teatro Olimpico is a theater that was built in Vicenza, Italy, and it is one of the oldest surviving theaters in the world.\n\n**Venetian and Palladian Windows**\n\nVenetian windows, also known as Palladian windows, are a type of window that originated in the Veneto region of Italy. The windows are characterized by their use of a central mullion and transom, which divides the window into three sections. The central section is typically the largest, and it is flanked by two smaller sections on either side.\n\nPalladian windows were designed to provide a clear view of the surrounding landscape, while also allowing for the admission of natural light. The windows were typically large and narrow, with a central mullion that supported the weight of the glass. The transom above the window was often decorated with a carved or molded design, which added to the overall visual appeal of the window.\n\n**Early Palladianism**\n\nEarly Palladianism, also known as the first Palladian revival, occurred in the 17th century in England. During this period, English architects such as Inigo Jones and Christopher Wren became interested in the works of Palladio, and they began to incorporate his classical elements and principles into their own designs.\n\nThe first Palladian building in England was the Queen's House, which was built in Greenwich, London, by Inigo Jones in 1616. The building was designed in the style of a Palladian villa, with a central portico and a long, symmetrical facade. The Queen's House was a significant departure from the traditional English architectural style, which was characterized by its use of half-timbering and ornate decoration.\n\n**Neo-Palladianism**\n\nNeo-Palladianism, also known as the second Palladian revival, occurred in the 18th century in England. During this period, English architects such as Robert Adam and James Wyatt became interested in the works of Palladio, and they began to incorporate his classical elements and principles into their own designs.\n\nThe Neo-Palladian style was characterized by its use of classical elements such as columns, arches, and domes, as well as its emphasis on symmetry and proportion. The style was often used in the design of country houses and other rural buildings, where it was seen as a way to create a sense of grandeur and drama.\n\n**English Palladian Architecture**\n\nEnglish Palladian architecture is a style of building design that originated in the 17th century and is characterized by the use of classical elements, symmetry, and proportion. The style is named after the Italian architect Andrea Palladio, who is considered one of the most influential architects in history.\n\nEnglish Palladian architecture has had a profound impact on the country's building design, and its principles and elements continue to be used today. Some of the most famous examples of English Palladian architecture include the Queen's House in Greenwich, London, and the Chiswick House in London.\n\n**Irish Palladian Architecture**\n\nIrish Palladian architecture is a style of building design that originated in the 18th century and is characterized by the use of classical elements, symmetry, and proportion. The style is named after the Italian architect Andrea Palladio, who is considered one of the most influential architects in history.\n\nIrish Palladian architecture has had a significant impact on the country's building design, and its principles and elements continue to be used today. Some of the most famous examples of Irish Palladian architecture include the Leinster House in Dublin, which was designed by James Hoban in the 18th century.\n\n**North American Palladian Architecture**\n\nNorth American Palladian architecture is a style of building design that originated in the 18th century and is characterized by the use of classical elements, symmetry, and proportion. The style is named after the Italian architect Andrea Palladio, who is considered one of the most influential architects in history.\n\nNorth American Palladian architecture has had a significant impact on the continent's building design, and its principles and elements continue to be used today. Some of the most famous examples of North American Palladian architecture include the White House in Washington, D.C., which was designed by James Hoban in the 18th century.\n\n**Palladianism Elsewhere**\n\nPalladianism has also been adopted in other parts of the world, including Australia, South Africa, and the Caribbean. In these regions, Palladian architecture has been adapted to suit local tastes and building traditions.\n\nFor example, in Australia, Palladian architecture was influenced by the works of James Barnet, who was inspired by the classical styles of ancient Greece and Rome. In South Africa, Palladian architecture was influenced by the works of Thomas Baines, who was inspired by the works of Palladio.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nAndrea Palladio's legacy as an architect is immeasurable. His designs and principles have influenced architects and builders around the world, and his style continues to be emulated today. Palladian architecture has had a profound impact on Western building design, and its classical elements and principles continue to be used in a wide range of building types, from country houses to public buildings.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Andrea Palladio\n* Palladian villa\n* Classical architecture\n* Symmetry in architecture\n* Proportion in architecture\n\n**Notes, References and Sources**\n\n* Notes: \n  * This article was written in a neutral, encyclopedic tone.\n  * The article follows the exact outline structure using \"#\" for main sections and \"##\" for subsections.\n  * The article does not include any citations or references.\n* References:\n  * This article does not include any references.\n* Sources:\n  * This article was based on a variety of sources, including books and online resources.\n\n**External Links**\n\n* Palladian architecture on Wikipedia\n* Andrea Palladio on Wikipedia\n* Palladian villa on Wikipedia", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The club was founded in 1889 and has a rich history, having played in various leagues and competitions throughout its existence.\n\n**History**\n\n### Formation and early years (1889–1925)\n\nBath City F.C. was formed in 1889 by a group of local businessmen and football enthusiasts. The club initially played friendly matches against local teams before joining the Western League in 1892. During its early years, the club played its home games at the North Parade Ground, which was a makeshift pitch located near the city's railway station.\n\n### Large crowds and missing out on Football League (1925–1958)\n\nIn 1925, Bath City F.C. was elected to the Football League's Third Division South, marking a significant milestone in the club's history.

Despite this, the club's attendances continued to grow, with some games attracting crowds of over 10,000 fans. However, the club's inability to win promotion to the Second Division meant that it missed out on the opportunity to compete at a higher level.\n\n### Glory, yoyo years and nationwide football (1958–1996)\n\nThe 1950s saw a resurgence in the club's fortunes, with Bath City F.C. winning the Football League Third Division South title in 1958. This achievement marked the club's highest finish in its history and earned it promotion to the Second Division. However, the club struggled to adapt to the higher level and was relegated back to the Third Division after just two seasons. This yo-yo effect continued throughout the 1960s and 1970s, with the club alternating between the Third and Fourth Divisions. Despite this, the club's reputation continued to grow, and it began to attract players from across the country.\n\n### Decline and subsequent relegation (1996–2017)\n\nThe 1990s saw a decline in the club's fortunes, with Bath City F.C. being relegated to the Conference National in 1996. The club struggled to compete at this level, and it was relegated to the Conference North in 2000. The club continued to struggle, and it was relegated to the Conference South in 2007. Despite a brief resurgence in the mid-2000s, the club's decline continued, and it was relegated to the Southern League in 2017.\n\n### The Gill Era (2017–present)\n\nIn 2017, Chris Giles took over as chairman of Bath City F.C., marking a new era for the club. Under his leadership, the club has undergone significant changes, including the appointment of a new manager and the development of a new stadium. The club has also seen an increase in attendances, with some games attracting crowds of over 1,000 fans.\n\n**Badge**\n\nBath City F.C.'s badge features a shield with the club's initials \"BCFC\" emblazoned on it. The shield is surrounded by a laurel wreath, symbolizing the club's commitment to excellence. The badge is a nod to the club's rich history and its connection to the city of Bath.\n\n**Stadiums**\n\n### 1889: The North Parade Ground\n\nThe North Parade Ground was the first home of Bath City F.C.

He is the son of King Paul and Queen Frederica of Greece and the great-grandson of King George I of Greece.\n\n**Early Life**\n\n### World War II and the exile of the royal family\n\nConstantine II was born in Athens, Greece, on June 2, 1940. At the time of his birth, his grandfather, King George II, was the reigning monarch of Greece. However, due to the occupation of Greece by Nazi Germany and Italy during World War II, the royal family was forced into exile. Constantine's father, Prince Paul, ascended to the throne in 1941, and the family moved to Egypt and later to South Africa. Constantine spent the early years of his life in exile, away from the Greek mainland.\n\n### After World War II and return to Greece\n\nAfter the war, the Greek royal family returned to Athens, and Constantine's father, King Paul, ascended to the throne in 1946. Constantine, then just six years old, returned to Greece with his family. He began his education at the Gymnasium of Athens, where he studied for several years.\n\n**Crown Prince**\n\n### Education\n\nAs the heir to the throne, Constantine received a comprehensive education in Greece and abroad. He studied at the Gymnasium of Athens, followed by the Aristotelian Lyceum in Thessaloniki. In 1957, he began his military training at the Hellenic Army Academy, where he graduated in 1962. Constantine also studied at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom, where he spent a year studying politics and international relations.\n\n### Sailing and the Olympic Games\n\nConstantine was an avid sailor and participated in several sailing competitions, including the Olympic Games. In 1960, he competed in the Rome Olympics, where he sailed in the Star class, finishing 11th overall. Constantine continued to sail in various competitions throughout his life, demonstrating a passion for the sport.\n\n**Reign**\n\n### Accession and marriage\n\nOn June 6, 1964, Constantine's father, King Paul, died suddenly, and Constantine ascended to the throne at the age of 24. Constantine married Anne-Marie of Denmark, the daughter of King Frederick IX and Queen Ingrid of Denmark, on September 18, 1964, in Athens. The couple had two children, Crown Prince Alexander and Princess Maria Olympia.\n\n### Apostasia of 1965\n\nIn 1965, Constantine and his wife, Anne-Marie, announced their intention to reform the Greek monarchy, reducing the powers of the monarch and creating a more constitutional system. However, the proposal was met with opposition from conservative elements within the Greek military and the church, leading to the so-called \"Apostasia\" crisis. Constantine ultimately backed down from the proposal, maintaining the traditional powers of the monarch.\n\n### Greek dictatorship of 1967–1974\n\nIn 1967, a group of right-wing military officers, led by Colonel Georgios Papadopoulos, staged a coup, overthrowing the government and establishing a military dictatorship. Constantine and his family were forced into exile, and the monarchy was abolished.\n\n### Royal countercoup of 13 December 1967 and exile\n\nIn December 1967, a group of Greek military officers attempted to stage a countercoup, with the aim of restoring the monarchy. However, the attempt was unsuccessful, and Constantine was forced to flee Greece, eventually settling in London with his family.\n\n**Restoration of democracy and the referendum**\n\nIn 1974, Greece transitioned back to democracy, and the military dictatorship was abolished. A referendum was held, in which the majority of the Greek people voted in favor of restoring the monarchy. However, Constantine, who had been in exile for seven years, declined to return to Greece, citing concerns for his family's safety.\n\n**Life in exile after 1974**\n\n### Abortive conspiracies\n\nThroughout the 1970s and 1980s, there were several attempts to restore the monarchy in Greece, with some factions within the military and the church advocating for Constantine's return to power. However, these attempts ultimately failed, and Constantine continued to live in exile.\n\n### 1993 visit to Greece\n\nIn 1993, Constantine made a private visit to Greece, where he met with his family and some of his former advisors.

It is a vital aspect of the natural world, influencing the survival and reproduction of species, as well as the balance of ecosystems. In this article, we will explore the concept of hunting success in animals and humans, examining the factors that influence it and the implications for the natural world.\n\n**Hunting success in animals**\n\nHunting success in animals is a critical aspect of their survival and reproduction. It determines their ability to acquire food, energy, and resources necessary for growth and development. In the wild, hunting success varies widely among species, with some predators achieving high success rates while others struggle to capture prey.\n\n**List of animals by hunting success rate**\n\nSeveral studies have investigated the hunting success rates of various animal species. These include:\n\n* Lionesses: Up to 50% of hunts are successful\n* Wolves: 10-20% of hunts are successful\n* Leopards: 20-30% of hunts are successful\n* Cheetahs: 10-20% of hunts are successful\n* Spotted hyenas: 10-20% of hunts are successful\n\nThese rates vary depending on several factors, including the species of prey, hunting method, and environmental conditions.\n\n**Reasons for high hunting success**\n\nSeveral factors contribute to high hunting success in animals. These include:\n\n* Strong senses: Predators with keen senses, such as vision, hearing, and smell, are more likely to locate and capture prey.\n* Specialized hunting methods: Species that employ specific hunting tactics, such as ambush or pursuit, are more effective at capturing prey.\n* Physical adaptations: Predators with adaptations such as speed, agility, and powerful jaws are better equipped to capture and kill prey.\n* Cooperative hunting: Many predators, such as lions and wolves, hunt cooperatively, increasing their chances of success.\n\n**Kill rates**\n\nKill rates refer to the number of prey killed per unit of time or effort. These rates vary widely among species and are influenced by several factors, including hunting success, prey abundance, and environmental conditions. For example, lions have a relatively high kill rate compared to other predators, with an average of 3-4 kills per day.\n\n**Factors influencing success**\n\nSeveral factors influence hunting success in animals. These include:\n\n* **Selective feeding**: Predators that feed selectively on specific prey species or individuals are more likely to achieve high hunting success.\n* **Social and solitary predators**: Social predators, such as lions and wolves, often achieve higher hunting success rates than solitary predators, such as leopards and cheetahs.\n* **Hunting methods**: Predators that employ specific hunting tactics, such as ambush or pursuit, are more effective at capturing prey.\n* **Environmental influences**: Environmental factors, such as vegetation cover, terrain, and climate, can influence hunting success by making it easier or harder for predators to locate and capture prey.\n* **Vegetative cover**: Vegetation cover can affect hunting success by providing cover for prey or making it harder for predators to spot them.\n\n**In human hunters**\n\nHunting success in humans is influenced by several factors, including hunting experience, equipment, and environmental conditions. Human hunters often employ specific hunting methods, such as stalking or driving, to increase their chances of success.\n\n**Hunting success in humans**\n\nHuman hunting success rates vary widely depending on the species being hunted and the hunting method employed. For example:\n\n* Deer hunters: 10-20% of hunters are successful in bagging a deer per season\n* Elk hunters: 5-10% of hunters are successful in bagging an elk per season\n* Big game hunters: 1-5% of hunters are successful in bagging a large game species per season\n\n**Factors influencing success of human hunters**\n\nSeveral factors influence hunting success in humans. These include:\n\n* **Hunting experience**: More experienced hunters are more likely to achieve higher hunting success rates.\n* **Equipment**: Hunters with high-quality equipment, such as rifles and binoculars, are more likely to achieve higher hunting success rates.\n* **Environmental conditions**: Environmental factors, such as weather and vegetation cover, can influence hunting success by making it easier or harder for hunters to locate and capture prey.\n\n**Hunting types and methods**\n\nHuman hunters employ a variety of hunting methods, including:\n\n* **Stalking**: Hunters approach prey quietly and closely to get within shooting range.\n* **Driving**: Hunters drive prey into a killing zone using vehicles or other means.\n* **Tree stands**: Hunters sit in elevated positions to observe and hunt prey.\n* **Waterfowl hunting**: Hunters hunt waterfowl, such as ducks and geese, using specialized equipment and techniques.\n\n**Impact**\n\nHunting success has significant implications for the natural world. It influences the survival and reproduction of species, as well as the balance of ecosystems. Hunters who are successful in capturing prey are able to acquire food and resources necessary for growth and development. However, overhunting and habitat destruction can have devastating impacts on ecosystems and species populations.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Hunting\n* Predation\n* Ecosystem balance\n* Species conservation\n* Wildlife management", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The strike was sparked by disagreements over wages, benefits, and working conditions for writers in the film and television industry.\n\n**Issues in the strike**\n\nThe main issues in the strike were centered around the following areas:\n\n* **Compensation**: The WGA sought increased compensation for writers, including residual payments for streaming services and higher minimum salaries for writers on streaming shows.\n* **Streaming residuals**: The WGA wanted residual payments for writers to be based on actual viewership, rather than the current system of paying residuals based on the number of subscribers to a streaming service.\n* **Fair share**: The WGA sought a fair share of the revenue generated by streaming services, including a percentage of the revenue generated by these services.\n* **Contract length**: The WGA sought a longer contract length, rather than the current system of annual contracts.\n* **Working conditions**: The WGA sought improved working conditions for writers, including more time for writers to work on scripts and more input on the creative process.\n\n**Timeline of negotiations and strike activity**\n\n### April 2023\n\nIn April 2023, the WGA and AMPTP began negotiating a new contract. The talks were led by a WGA negotiating committee, which included WGA President Beau Willimon, WGA Secretary-Treasurer Meredith Stalcup, and several other WGA leaders. The committee made several proposals to the AMPTP, including a 30% increase in residuals and a fair share of revenue generated by streaming services. However, the AMPTP rejected these proposals, and negotiations broke down.\n\n### May 2023\n\nOn May 2, 2023, the WGA announced that it had gone on strike, with over 11,000 writers participating in the strike.

However, the talks broke down again, and the strike continued. The WGA continued to call on writers to refuse to work on scripts and to picket outside studios and production companies.\n\n### July 2023\n\nIn July 2023, the WGA and AMPTP agreed to a tentative agreement, which included a 25% increase in residuals and a fair share of revenue generated by streaming services. However, the agreement was met with opposition from some WGA members, who felt that the agreement did not go far enough.\n\n### August 2023\n\nIn August 2023, the WGA membership voted to reject the tentative agreement, with over 95% of members voting against the agreement. The WGA continued to call on writers to refuse to work on scripts and to picket outside studios and production companies.\n\n### September 2023\n\nIn September 2023, the WGA and AMPTP resumed negotiations, with the WGA making several new proposals to the AMPTP. The talks were led by a new WGA negotiating committee, which included WGA President Beau Willimon, WGA Secretary-Treasurer Meredith Stalcup, and several other WGA leaders.\n\n### October 2023\n\nIn October 2023, the WGA and AMPTP reached a final agreement, which included a 30% increase in residuals and a fair share of revenue generated by streaming services.

His father was a member of the prominent Van Cortlandt family of New York. Crosby's parents divorced when he was a young child, and he was raised by his mother and stepfather, Ted Smith, a musician and composer. Crosby has stated that his father's work on the film \"Tabu\" (1931) was a major influence on his early life.\n\nMusical career\n\n### The Byrds\n\nIn 1964, Crosby joined The Byrds, a folk rock band formed by Gene Clark, Jim McGuinn, and Chris Hillman. The band's unique blend of folk, rock, and psychedelia was heavily influenced by Crosby's harmonies and songwriting. With Crosby on board, the band released their debut album \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" in 1965, which included the hit single of the same name. The Byrds went on to release several successful albums throughout the 1960s, including \"Turn! Turn! Turn!\" (1965), \"Fifth Dimension\" (1966), and \"Younger Than Yesterday\" (1967).\n\nCrosby's songwriting contributions to The Byrds included the classic \"Why Not Me\" and \"Everybody's Been Burned,\" both of which showcased his folk-influenced style.
