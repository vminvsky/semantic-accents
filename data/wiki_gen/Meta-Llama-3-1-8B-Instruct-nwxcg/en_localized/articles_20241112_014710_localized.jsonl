The election was the 49th parliamentary election held in Sweden since the country became a constitutional monarchy in 1809.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Löfven's government\n\nThe previous government, led by Prime Minister Stefan Löfven of the Social Democrats, was in power since 2014. The Löfven government had been a minority government, supported by the Green Party and the Left Party. In 2018, Löfven's government lost a no-confidence vote in the Riksdag, but managed to stay in power after securing the support of the Centre Party.\n\n### Andersson's government\n\nIn 2021, Magdalena Andersson, a former Finance Minister and Deputy Prime Minister, became the leader of the Social Democrats and succeeded Stefan Löfven as Prime Minister. Andersson's government was also a minority government, supported by the Green Party and the Left Party. However, Andersson's government was short-lived, as she resigned after losing a vote of confidence in the Riksdag in November 2021.\n\n**Electoral system**\n\nThe 2022 Swedish general election used a proportional representation system, where voters cast ballots for parties rather than individual candidates. The election was held using a party-list system, where voters could choose from a list of candidates provided by each party. The number of seats allocated to each party was proportional to the number of votes it received.\n\n### Political parties\n\nA total of 28 parties were registered to participate in the election.

With a population of approximately 12,000 people, it is the second-largest town on Maui and is known for its rich history, cultural significance, and natural beauty. Lahaina was once the capital of the Kingdom of Hawaii, a major hub for the whaling industry, and a center for Christian missionary activity. Today, it is a popular tourist destination, attracting visitors from around the world with its stunning beaches, lush rainforests, and vibrant arts and culture scene.\n\n**#History**\n\nLahaina's history dates back to the 13th century, when it was a major settlement for the Native Hawaiian people. The town's strategic location on the west coast of Maui made it an important center for trade and commerce.\n\n### **Modern name, etymology and pronunciations**\n\nThe modern name \"Lahaina\" is derived from the Hawaiian words \"La\" meaning \"cruel\" and \"Haina\" meaning \"place\" or \"town\". The name is thought to refer to the island's harsh and unforgiving climate. The town is pronounced \"LA-hah-ee-nah\".\n\n### **Ancient names**\n\nLahaina was known by several other names in ancient times. The town was called \"La'ihonua\" by the Native Hawaiians, which translates to \"the place where heaven and earth meet\". It was also known as \"La'ipuna\", which means \"the place of cruel gods\".\n\n### **Early rulers**\n\nLahaina was ruled by several chiefdoms in ancient times, including the ruling family of the Ali'i Nui, who were the highest-ranking chiefs in the island of Maui.\n\n### **Western contact**\n\nThe arrival of Western explorers and traders in the 18th century marked the beginning of a new era for Lahaina. The town became a major hub for the whaling industry, with many ships coming to the island to hunt and process whales.\n\n### **Kahekili II**\n\nKahekili II was a powerful ali'i who ruled over Lahaina in the late 18th century. He was a skilled warrior and a fierce leader who expanded the island's borders through military conquest.\n\n### **Kamehameha I and Kamehameha II**\n\nKamehameha I and Kamehameha II were two of the most influential rulers in Hawaiian history. Kamehameha I, also known as Kamehameha the Great, united the islands of Hawaii under one rule, while Kamehameha II abolished the kapu system, a ancient Hawaiian law that governed many aspects of life.\n\n### **Christian missionaries**\n\nChristian missionaries arrived in Lahaina in the early 19th century, and the town became a center for Christian missionary activity. The missionaries established several churches and schools, and introduced Western education and culture to the island.\n\n### **Whaling**\n\nWhaling was a major industry in Lahaina during the 19th century. The town was home to several whaling ships and companies, which hunted and processed whales in the surrounding oceans.\n\n### **Kamehameha III**\n\nKamehameha III was the third king of Hawaii and ruled from 1825 to 1854. He was a wise and just ruler who promoted education, trade, and agriculture.\n\n### **20th century**\n\nIn the 20th century, Lahaina underwent significant changes. The town became a popular tourist destination, and many of its historic buildings were restored and preserved.\n\n## **2023 wildfire**\n\nIn 2023, a devastating wildfire swept through Lahaina, destroying several homes and businesses. The fire was eventually brought under control, but not before causing significant damage and disruption to the town.\n\n**#Geography**\n\nLahaina is located on the west coast of the island of Maui, approximately 45 miles northwest of Kahului. The town is situated on a small peninsula, surrounded by the Pacific Ocean to the west and the Maalaea Bay to the east.\n\n### **Climate**\n\nLahaina has a tropical savanna climate, with warm temperatures and high humidity throughout the year. The town experiences a dry season from May to October, with a wet season from November to April.\n\n**#Demographics**\n\nAs of the 2020 census, the population of Lahaina was approximately 12,000 people. The town has a diverse population, with a mix of Native Hawaiians, Caucasians, Asians, and Pacific Islanders.\n\n**#Arts and culture**\n\nLahaina is a vibrant arts and culture scene, with a variety of galleries, museums, and performance venues.

First established in 1995, the award has recognized the achievements of climbers from around the globe, acknowledging their outstanding contributions to the sport.\n\n**History**\n\nThe Piolets_d'Or was founded by Claude Hureau, a French mountaineer and journalist, in 1995. Hureau's vision was to create an award that would celebrate the art of alpinism and recognize the achievements of climbers who push the boundaries of human endeavor. The first Piolets_d'Or ceremony took place in 1996, and since then, the award has been presented annually to a select group of climbers.\n\n**Multiple winners**\n\nOne of the unique features of the Piolets_d'Or is its recognition of multiple winners. While most awards are given to a single individual or team, the Piolets_d'Or often honors multiple climbers for their achievements in a given year. This approach reflects the collaborative and supportive nature of the mountaineering community, where climbers often work together to achieve shared goals.\n\n**Criteria**\n\nThe selection process for the Piolets_d'Or is rigorous and competitive. A panel of experts, comprising renowned climbers and journalists, reviews nominations from around the world and selects the winners based on their achievements in the preceding year. The criteria for selection include:\n\n* First ascents of new routes or summits\n* Repeat ascents of difficult routes or summits\n* Innovative climbing techniques or solutions\n* Contributions to the development of climbing equipment or technology\n* Inspirational leadership or mentorship\n\n**Reception**\n\nThe Piolets_d'Or has received widespread recognition and acclaim within the mountaineering community. Climbers who have received the award have hailed it as a testament to their hard work and dedication to the sport. The award has also been praised for its ability to inspire and motivate climbers to push themselves to new heights.\n\n**Criticism**\n\nDespite its widespread acclaim, the Piolets_d'Or has faced criticism from some quarters. Some have argued that the award is too focused on individual achievement, neglecting the contributions of teams and support staff.

The Banat was created as a result of the tumultuous period of Ottoman rule and the subsequent Austrian conquest of the region.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe Banat of Craiova was a unique entity that emerged from the ashes of the Ottoman Empire's decline in the region. The Banat was characterized by a complex web of relationships between the Ottoman and Habsburg empires, as well as the local boyar and peasant populations. This article will provide a comprehensive overview of the history, legacy, and cultural significance of the Banat of Craiova.\n\n**History**\n\n### **Austrian Conquest**\n\nIn 1691, the Habsburg Empire, led by Emperor Leopold I, began to actively expand its territories in Southeastern Europe. The Habsburgs saw the region as a crucial buffer zone against the Ottoman Empire, which had been in decline since the 17th century. The Austrians' military campaigns in the region were marked by a series of victories, including the capture of Craiova in 1692. The city became the capital of the newly established Banat of Craiova.\n\n### **Government Creation**\n\nUpon capturing Craiova, the Austrians established a new administrative system in the region. The Banat was governed by a Ban, or a high-ranking official appointed by the Habsburg Emperor. The Ban was responsible for collecting taxes, maintaining law and order, and overseeing the administration of justice. The Banat was also divided into several smaller administrative units, each governed by a smaller official known as a Proto.\n\n### **Boyar and Peasant Resistance**\n\nThe establishment of the Banat of Craiova was met with resistance from the local boyar and peasant populations. The boyars, who were the traditional ruling class in Wallachia, saw the Austrian conquest as a threat to their power and privileges. The peasants, on the other hand, were primarily concerned with the economic and social changes that the Banat brought. Many peasants were forced to pay taxes and provide labor to the Austrian authorities, which further exacerbated their already difficult living conditions.\n\n### **Austrian Consolidation**\n\nDespite the initial resistance, the Austrians were able to consolidate their control over the Banat of Craiova. The Ban and the Proto officials worked to establish a stable administrative system, and the region began to flourish economically. Trade and commerce flourished, and the city of Craiova became an important center of culture and learning.\n\n### **Ottoman Reconquest**\n\nHowever, the Ottoman Empire was not ready to concede defeat. In 1718, the Ottomans launched a counterattack against the Banat of Craiova, and the region was eventually reconquered. The Banat was abolished, and the region was once again absorbed into the Ottoman Empire.\n\n**Legacy**\n\n### **\"Colonial\" Precedent**\n\nThe Banat of Craiova is often seen as a precursor to the colonial era in Southeastern Europe. The establishment of the Banat by the Austrians marked the beginning of a new era of foreign domination in the region. The Banat's experience serves as a reminder of the complex and often tumultuous history of colonialism in the region.\n\n### **Cultural Survivals**\n\nDespite the Banat's relatively short existence, it has left a lasting cultural impact on the region. The city of Craiova has retained many of the architectural and cultural features that were introduced during the Banat era. The city's historic center, with its mix of Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian architecture, is a testament to the region's complex cultural heritage.\n\n**Symbols**\n\nThe Banat of Craiova has several symbols that are still used today. The most notable of these is the Banat's coat of arms, which features a shield with a white background and a red cross. The coat of arms is often displayed on the city's official flag and is a symbol of the region's rich history and cultural heritage.\n\n**Notes**\n\nThe Banat of Craiova is a fascinating chapter in the history of Southeastern Europe. The region's complex cultural and administrative history has left a lasting legacy that continues to shape the region's identity today.

The election was the 15th general election in Malaysian history and the first since the 2020–22 Malaysian political crisis.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Previous election\n\nThe previous general election, the 14th Malaysian general election, was held on May 9, 2018. The election saw the defeat of the long-ruling Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition, which had been in power since Malaysia's independence in 1957. The Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition, led by Mahathir Mohamad, won the election and formed the new federal government.\n\n### Significant events\n\nThe 2022 general election was held amidst a significant economic downturn, with Malaysia facing a recession and high inflation. The election was also marked by controversy surrounding the government's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as allegations of corruption and abuse of power.\n\n### 2020–22 political crisis\n\nIn 2020, the Pakatan Harapan government faced a series of challenges, including the COVID-19 pandemic and a global economic downturn. The government's handling of the pandemic was widely criticized, and the economy suffered significantly. In February 2020, the prime minister, Muhyiddin Yassin, was sworn in as the seventh prime minister of Malaysia, following the collapse of the Pakatan Harapan government.\n\nThe new government, led by Muhyiddin, was a coalition of the Perikatan Nasional (PN) parties, including the Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (Bersatu) and the Parti Islam Se-Malaysia (PAS). The government faced significant opposition from the opposition parties, including the Pakatan Harapan (PH) and the Democratic Action Party (DAP).\n\n**Electoral system**\n\nThe electoral system in Malaysia is based on the first-past-the-post system, where the candidate with the most votes in a constituency wins the seat. The country is divided into 222 parliamentary constituencies, each with a single member of parliament (MP). The MPs are elected for a five-year term, with the exception of the first general election, which was held in 1955.\n\n**Timeline**\n\n### Dissolution of parliament\n\nOn October 10, 2022, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, Al-Sultan Abdullah Ri'ayatuddin Al-Mustafa Billah Shah, dissolved the 15th Parliament, following a request from the prime minister, Ismail Sabri Yaakob.\n\n### Dissolution of state legislatures\n\nOn the same day, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong also dissolved the state legislative assemblies of 12 out of 13 states, including the states of Johor, Kedah, Kelantan, Malacca, Negeri Sembilan, Pahang, Penang, Perak, Perlis, Sabah, Sarawak, and Selangor.\n\n### Pre-nomination events\n\nPrior to the election, several events took place, including the nomination of candidates, the distribution of campaign materials, and the conduct of public debates and forums.\n\n### Timetable\n\nThe election was held on November 19, 2022, with voting taking place from 8:00 am to 6:00 pm. The counting of votes began at 6:00 pm, with the results announced by the Election Commission (EC) on the same day.\n\n**Last election pendulum**\n\nThe last election pendulum, also known as the \"bendera\" in Malay, is a graphical representation of the election results, showing the number of seats won by each party or coalition. The pendulum is based on the swing of votes between parties and is used to predict the outcome of future elections.\n\n**Political parties and candidates**\n\n### Parties represented in current legislatures\n\nSeveral parties were represented in the current legislatures, including the Pakatan Harapan (PH), the Perikatan Nasional (PN), the Barisan Nasional (BN), the Malaysian United Indigenous Party (BERSATU), the Parti Islam Se-Malaysia (PAS), the Democratic Action Party (DAP), the Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA), the Gerakan (GERAKAN), and the Malaysian Indian Congress (MIC).\n\n### Extra-parliamentary parties\n\nSeveral extra-parliamentary parties also contested the election, including the Parti Sosialis Malaysia (PSM), the Socialist Party of Malaysia (PSM), the Parti Rakyat Malaysia (PRM), and the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).\n\n### Nominated candidates\n\nA total of 212 candidates were nominated for the election, including 141 men and 71 women.\n\n**Campaign**\n\n### Timing of election\n\nThe election was held on November 19, 2022, with voting taking place from 8:00 am to 6:00 pm.\n\n### Youth vote\n\nThe youth vote, comprising citizens aged between 18 and 24, played a significant role in the election, with many young voters casting their ballots in support of the opposition parties.\n\n**Outgoing members of parliament**\n\nA total of 222 members of parliament (MPs) lost their seats in the election, with 202 members of the outgoing parliament being defeated.\n\n**Opinion polls**\n\nSeveral opinion polls were conducted prior to the election, predicting the outcome of the election. However, the actual results differed significantly from the polls.\n\n**Results**\n\n### By alliance\n\nThe results of the election showed that the Perikatan Nasional (PN) coalition won the most seats, followed by the Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition.\n\n### By parliamentary seats\n\nThe Perikatan Nasional (PN) coalition won a total of 92 seats, while the Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition won 82 seats.\n\n### State assemblies\n\nThe Perikatan Nasional (PN) coalition also won a majority of the seats in several state legislative assemblies, including the states of Johor, Kedah, Kelantan, Malacca, Negeri Sembilan, Pahang, and Penang.\n\n### Seats that changed allegiance\n\nA total of 53 seats changed allegiance from one party to another, with 35 seats changing from the Pakatan Harapan (PH) to the Perikatan Nasional (PN) and 18 seats changing from the Perikatan Nasional (PN) to the Pakatan Harapan (PH).\n\n**Aftermath**\n\n### Formation of federal government\n\nThe Perikatan Nasional (PN) coalition, led by Ismail Sabri Yaakob, formed the new federal government following the election.\n\n### International reactions\n\nThe international community reacted to the election results, with several countries congratulating the Perikatan Nasional (PN) coalition on their victory.\n\n**See also**\n\n* 2020–22 Malaysian political crisis\n* Pakatan Harapan\n* Perikatan Nasional\n* Barisan Nasional\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The article is based on the results of the 2022 Malaysian general election and may not reflect the views of the parties or individuals involved.\n\n**References**\n\n* The article does not include any references.\n\n**External links**\n\n* Election Commission of Malaysia\n* Parliament of Malaysia\n* Malaysian Government Website", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

Her early life was marked by a strong sense of adventure and a desire to serve others. Mordaunt's father, a naval officer, instilled in her a deep respect for the military and a sense of duty to country. She attended Torquay Girls' Grammar School and later studied politics at the University of Reading, where she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree.\n\n**Early Professional Career**\n\nAfter completing her studies, Mordaunt worked as a civil servant in the Ministry of Defence, where she gained valuable experience in policy development and implementation. She later moved to the private sector, working as a communications consultant for various companies, including the Royal Navy's merchant navy division. Mordaunt's experience in the private sector helped her develop a keen understanding of business and economics, which she would later utilize in her ministerial roles.\n\n**Entry into Parliament**\n\nMordaunt was first elected as the Member of Parliament for Portsmouth North in the 2010 general election, defeating the incumbent Liberal Democrat MP, Sarah McCarthy-Fry.

She was a key figure in the development of the government's women's empowerment agenda and played a leading role in the UK's response to the #MeToo movement.\n\n### **Secretary of State for Defence: 2019**\n\nMordaunt's appointment as Secretary of State for Defence was a significant moment in her career. She was the first woman to hold the post, and her experience in the Ministry of Defence and her private sector work made her well-suited to the role. During her tenure, she oversaw a number of key initiatives, including the development of the UK's military strategy and the modernization of the country's defense infrastructure.\n\n### **Re-entry into Government**\n\nAfter the 2019 general election, Mordaunt was re-elected as the Member of Parliament for Portsmouth North. She was later appointed as the Minister for the Armed Forces, a position she held until 2022.\n\n### **Leader of the House of Commons: 2022–2024**\n\nIn 2022, Mordaunt was appointed as the Leader of the House of Commons, a position that made her the first woman to hold the post in over 20 years. She played a key role in guiding the government's legislative agenda and was a vocal advocate for the rights of parliamentarians.\n\n**Conservative Leadership Bids**\n\nMordaunt twice ran for the Conservative Party leadership, in 2022 and again in 2023. Her first bid was unsuccessful, but she announced her candidacy in 2023, citing her experience and commitment to the party's values.\n\n### **July–September 2022**\n\nMordaunt's first leadership bid was marked by controversy, with some of her colleagues questioning her experience and judgment. Despite this, she remained a popular figure in the party, and her campaign gained momentum in the final stages of the contest.\n\n### **October 2022**\n\nMordaunt's second leadership bid was more successful, but she ultimately lost to Rishi Sunak. Despite this, she remained committed to the party and its values, and she continued to play a key role in shaping its agenda.\n\n**Military Service**\n\nMordaunt is a strong supporter of the military and has served in various capacities, including as a reservist in the Royal Navy. She has also been a vocal advocate for the rights of veterans and has worked to promote their welfare.\n\n**Views and Activities**\n\nMordaunt has been involved in a number of high-profile controversies, including:\n\n### **Splash! appearance**\n\nIn 2019, Mordaunt appeared on the ITV program Splash!, where she jumped off a cliff and completed a series of diving challenges. The episode was widely watched, but some critics questioned her judgment in appearing on the show.\n\n### **Brexit**\n\nMordaunt has been a strong supporter of Brexit and has argued that the UK's departure from the EU is essential to the country's sovereignty and prosperity. She has been a vocal critic of the EU's policies and has advocated for a hard Brexit.\n\n### **Northern Ireland**\n\nMordaunt has been involved in a number of controversies related to Northern Ireland, including her comments on the Good Friday Agreement and her support for the DUP's Brexit strategy.
