Originating from the Aberffraw cantref in Anglesey, they played a significant role in shaping the country's history and politics during the Welsh dynasties period. This article will explore the history and significance of the House of Aberffraw, their power base, succession, and contributions to Welsh politics.\n\n**Aberffraw hundred (cantref)**\n\nThe House of Aberffraw originated from the Aberffraw cantref, a hundred in the kingdom of Gwynedd in northwest Wales. The cantref was an administrative division of the kingdom, consisting of a group of townships or commotes. Aberffraw was a strategic location, situated on the eastern coast of Anglesey, which provided access to the Irish Sea and the mainland. The cantref was an important center of trade and commerce, with a strong focus on maritime activities.\n\n**Welsh dynasties**\n\nThe Welsh dynasties period, which spanned from the 9th to the 13th centuries, saw the rise and fall of various royal houses in Wales. The Aberffraw dynasty emerged during this time, as a powerful and influential force in Welsh politics. The dynasty was characterized by a strong sense of identity and a determination to maintain their power and status.\n\n**Succession**\n\nThe succession of the Aberffraw dynasty was marked by a complex system of inheritance and alliances. The ruler of the dynasty was typically the eldest son of the previous ruler, although there were instances of younger sons and even daughters rising to power. Marriages were also an important factor in securing alliances and consolidating power, with rulers often marrying into other powerful families to strengthen their position.\n\n**Cambro-Norse era**\n\nThe Cambro-Norse era, which spanned from the late 9th to the early 11th centuries, saw the influence of Norse culture and politics in Wales. The Aberffraw dynasty, like other Welsh royal houses, was affected by this era, with many rulers adopting Norse customs and practices. The dynasty's power and influence waxed and waned during this period, as they navigated the complex web of alliances and rivalries with other Welsh and Norse houses.\n\n**Power base (Norman invasion)**\n\nThe Norman invasion of Wales in the late 11th century had a significant impact on the Aberffraw dynasty. The Normans, who had recently conquered England, sought to expand their territories into Wales. The Aberffraw dynasty, which had previously been a major power in the region, found themselves facing a new and formidable challenge. The Normans established a power base in northern Wales, which threatened the Aberffraw dynasty's position.\n\n**Aberffraw senior line**\n\nThe Aberffraw senior line was a distinct branch of the dynasty, characterized by a strong sense of identity and a focus on maintaining their power and status. This line emerged during the 12th century, as the Aberffraw dynasty sought to consolidate their position in the face of Norman expansion. The senior line was marked by a series of powerful rulers, who maintained their independence and influence in the region.\n\n**Llys**\n\nA llys was a court or assembly hall, which played a significant role in the governance and politics of the Aberffraw dynasty. The llys was a place where the ruler would hold court, receiving guests, dispensing justice, and conducting affairs of state. The llys was also a center of culture and learning, where poets, musicians, and scholars would gather to share their knowledge and creativity.\n\n**Rhosyr**\n\nRhosyr was a town on the Isle of Anglesey, which played a significant role in the Aberffraw dynasty's history. The town was an important center of trade and commerce, with a strong focus on maritime activities. Rhosyr was also a strategic location, providing access to the Irish Sea and the mainland.\n\n**Aberffraw**\n\nAberffraw was the ancestral home of the Aberffraw dynasty, situated in the heart of the Aberffraw cantref. The town was a significant center of power and influence, with a strong focus on agriculture and trade. Aberffraw was also a cultural hub, where poets, musicians, and scholars would gather to share their knowledge and creativity.\n\n**Princes of Wales (de facto)**\n\nThe Aberffraw dynasty played a significant role in the history of the Principality of Wales. The Princes of Wales were the rulers of the region, who exercised a degree of autonomy and independence. The Aberffraw dynasty, like other Welsh royal houses, was affected by the complex web of alliances and rivalries with other Welsh and English houses.\n\n**Llywelyn the Great**\n\nLlywelyn the Great was a powerful and influential ruler of the Aberffraw dynasty, who played a significant role in shaping the history of Wales. Llywelyn was a skilled politician and military leader, who expanded the Aberffraw dynasty's territories and influence. He was also a patron of the arts and culture, who encouraged the development of Welsh literature and learning.\n\n**1200s- 1400s**\n\nThe 13th to 15th centuries saw a significant shift in the power and influence of the Aberffraw dynasty. The Black Death, which swept through Europe in the 14th century, had a devastating impact on the population and economy of Wales. The Aberffraw dynasty, like other Welsh royal houses, struggled to maintain their power and status in the face of these challenges.\n\n**Succession after the dynasty**\n\nThe Aberffraw dynasty declined in the 15th century, as the power and influence of other Welsh royal houses grew. The succession of the Aberffraw dynasty was marked by a series of complex alliances and rivalries, which ultimately led to the decline of the dynasty. The Aberffraw dynasty's legacy, however, continued to shape the history and politics of Wales.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Aberffraw\n* Anglesey\n* Gwynedd\n* Llywelyn the Great\n* Principality of Wales\n* Welsh dynasties\n\n**Footnotes**\n\nThis article includes no footnotes.\n\n**References**\n\nThis article includes no references.\n\n**Sources**\n\nThis article is based on a range of sources, including:\n\n* The Historia Brittonum\n* The Annales Cambriae\n* The Brut y Tywysogion\n* The Welsh Annals\n\n**Further reading**\n\nFor further information on the Aberffraw dynasty, see:\n\n* The Aberffraw family history project\n* The Anglesey and Gwynedd history project\n* The Principality of Wales history project\n* The Welsh dynasties project", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The scandal centers around the alleged repeated breaches of COVID-19 lockdown rules by government officials and politicians at 10 Downing Street, the official residence of the Prime Minister, and other government locations.\n\n**Background**\n\n### COVID-19 lockdowns in the United Kingdom\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic led to widespread lockdowns and restrictions across the United Kingdom. The government imposed various levels of restrictions, including Stay at Home orders, to mitigate the spread of the virus. These restrictions limited social contact, closed non-essential businesses, and prohibited large gatherings.\n\n### Westminster\n\nThe government's response to the pandemic, particularly in relation to lockdown restrictions, has been subject to scrutiny. The United Kingdom's capital, London, was subject to different tiers of restrictions throughout the pandemic, with areas of high infection rates classified as Tier 2 and Tier 3.\n\n**Timeline of reporting and reaction**\n\n### 2021\n\n#### Up to 6 December\n\nThe first reports of lockdown breaches at 10 Downing Street emerged in December 2021, but they were largely dismissed as minor incidents.\n\n#### Stratton video (7–8 December)\n\nA video of Allegra Stratton, the Prime Minister's press secretary, emerged showing her and other officials joking about an alleged Christmas party at 10 Downing Street in December 2021. The video sparked outrage, and the Prime Minister initially denied that any party had taken place.\n\n#### 9 December onwards\n\nFollowing the emergence of the Stratton video, the government faced mounting pressure to address the allegations. The Prime Minister eventually admitted to attending a \"bring your own booze\" event in the garden of 10 Downing Street, but claimed it was a work event.\n\n### 2022\n\n#### Up to 19 January\n\nThe government faced increasing scrutiny over the allegations, with opposition parties and the media calling for a full investigation.

and the government's response to the pandemic.\n\n##### June–October 2023\n\nThe Privileges Committee, which investigates allegations of misconduct by MPs, continued its investigation into the lockdown breaches, with the Prime Minister facing the possibility of a censure or even expulsion from Parliament.\n\n**Events**\n\n### During first national lockdown\n\nThe first reports of lockdown breaches emerged during the first national lockdown in March 2020, with allegations of parties and gatherings at 10 Downing Street.\n\n### Mid-2020\n\nThe government faced increasing scrutiny over the

London, with further allegations emerging of parties and gatherings at 10 Downing Street and other government locations.\n\n### During third lockdown in England\n\nThe lockdown breaches continued during the third lockdown in England, with further allegations emerging of parties and gatherings at 10 Downing Street and other government locations.\n\n**Investigations**\n\n### Cabinet Office inquiry\n\nThe Cabinet Office launched an inquiry into the lockdown breaches, led by Simon Case, the head of the Civil Service.\n\n### Sue Gray\n\nSue Gray, a senior civil servant, was appointed to lead the inquiry, which found that there had been a culture of disregard for the rules at 10 Downing Street.\n\n### Investigation update\n\nThe inquiry was updated in January 2023, with the police concluding their investigation into the lockdown breaches.\n\n### Alleged lobbying before the final report was published\n\nThere were allegations of lobbying by government officials and politicians before the final report was published, which were denied by the government.\n\n### Final report\n\nThe final report was published in February 2023, which found that there had been a culture of disregard for the rules at 10 Downing Street.\n\n### Police investigation\n\nThe police launched an investigation into the lockdown breaches, which issued 126 fixed penalty notices to government officials and politicians.\n\n### Scrutiny of the investigation\n\nThe investigation was subject to scrutiny, with opposition parties and the media calling for a full inquiry.\n\n**Privileges

The film stars Daniel Kaluuya, Keke Palmer, and Brandon Perea. It follows a pair of horse riders who discover a mysterious alien presence in their California desert home.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film takes place in the 1990s in the fictional town of Hawthorne, California. The story centers around two siblings, Emancipation Abbie (Keke Palmer) and OJ Haywood (Daniel Kaluuya), who are trying to save their family's horse ranch from being sold to a group of developers. The siblings soon discover a strange, unidentified flying object (UFO) that appears to be hovering above their property.\n\nAs they investigate the UFO, they meet two outsiders, Angel Torres (Brandon Perea) and Ruth (Riley Keough), who claim to have knowledge about the object. The group soon realizes that the UFO is not a natural phenomenon, but an alien presence that is watching them. The aliens begin to communicate with the group, and they soon discover that the aliens are not aggressive, but rather, they are being manipulated by a powerful entity that is controlling their actions.\n\nAs the story unfolds, the group discovers that the entity is a powerful being that has been manipulating the aliens for its own purposes. The entity is revealed to be a malevolent presence that is using the aliens to harvest a valuable resource from the Earth. The group must work together to stop the entity and save the world from destruction.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Daniel Kaluuya as OJ Haywood\n* Keke Palmer as Emancipation Abbie\n* Brandon Perea as Angel Torres\n* Steven Yeun as Ryder\n* Michael Wincott as Antlers Holst\n* Wrenn Schmidt as Emerald Hayes\n* Barbie Ferreira as Indigo\n* Keith David as Otis Haywood Sr.\n\n**Themes and interpretations**\n\n_Nope_ explores several themes, including the nature of reality, the power of perception, and the consequences of playing with forces beyond human control. The film also explores the idea of community and how individuals come together to face a common threat. The film has been interpreted as a commentary on the ways in which humans are controlled by external forces, and how we are often unaware of the true nature of reality.\n\nThe film's title, _Nope_, has been interpreted as a reference to the idea that nothing is as it seems. The film's use of the word \"nope\" as a phrase repeated throughout the story has been seen as a way of highlighting the idea that our perceptions of reality are often false.\n\n**Production**\n\n### Development\n\n_Nope_ was first conceived by Jordan Peele in 2018, when he was approached by Universal Pictures to write a script for a film about a UFO sighting. Peele was initially hesitant, but after researching the subject, he became fascinated by the idea of exploring the concept of a UFO sighting through a horror lens.\n\nPeele spent several months researching and writing the script, which was initially titled _Observation Point_. The script was later rewritten and retitled _Nope_, which was inspired by the idea of the word \"nope\" as a phrase repeated throughout the story.\n\n### Filming\n\nFilming for _Nope_ began in October 2020 and wrapped in February 2021. The film was shot on location in various locations in California, including the town of Joshua Tree and the Mojave Desert.\n\nThe film's cinematography was handled by Hoyte van Hoytema, who used a combination of digital and film cameras to capture the film's unique visual aesthetic. The film's score was composed by Michael Abels, who incorporated a range of sounds and instruments to create the film's unsettling and atmospheric soundtrack.\n\n### Creature design\n\nThe film's creature design was created by Todd Masters, who is known for his work on films such as _The Thing_ and _Alien_. Masters worked closely with Peele to develop the creature's design, which was inspired by a range of natural and supernatural sources.\n\nThe creature's design was influenced by the idea of a \"mirror\" or a \"reflection\" of the human form, which was reflected in the creature's use of mirrored surfaces and its ability to manipulate light and reflections.\n\n### Costumes\n\nThe film's costumes were designed by Ruth Carter, who is known for her work on films such as _Selma_ and _Black Panther_. Carter's costumes were inspired by the film's 1990s setting, and she incorporated a range of vintage and thrift store finds into her designs.\n\n### Sound design\n\nThe film's sound design was handled by Scott Millan, who is known for his work on films such as _Jurassic Park_ and _The Lord of the Rings_. Millan worked closely with Peele to develop the film's unique soundscapes, which incorporated a range of natural and supernatural sounds.\n\n### Music\n\nThe film's score was composed by Michael Abels, who is known for his work on films such as _Get Out_ and _Us_. Abels's score incorporated a range of sounds and instruments, including a 90-piece orchestra and a range of electronic and found sounds.\n\n**Marketing**\n\n_Nope_ was first announced in June 2020, when Universal Pictures released a trailer for the film. The trailer was met with a range of positive and negative reactions, with some critics praising the film's unique visual aesthetic and others criticizing its unclear plot.\n\nIn the months leading up to the film's release, Universal Pictures released a range of promotional materials, including posters, TV spots, and social media teasers. The film's marketing campaign was focused on building hype and generating buzz around the film's unique concept and visuals.\n\n**Release**\n\n_Nope_ was released on July 22, 2022, in the United States and Canada.

On Metacritic, the film has a score of 62 out of 100, based on 58 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\n**Box office**\n\n_Nope_ opened with a range of positive box office results, grossing over $55 million in its opening weekend in the United States. The film's worldwide box office gross was over $200 million, making it one of the highest-grossing films of 2022.\n\n**Critical response**\n\nThe film received a range of positive and negative reviews from critics, with some praising the film's unique visual aesthetic and others criticizing its unclear plot.\n\nSome critics praised the film's use of visual effects and its ability to create a sense of unease and tension. Others criticized the film's pacing and its unclear plot, which some found confusing and hard to follow.\n\n**Accolades**\n\n_Nope_ has been nominated for a range of awards, including several Academy Awards and Golden Globe Awards. The film has won several awards, including the 2023 Academy Award for Best Visual Effects.\n\n**Possible sequels**\n\nThere is currently no official word on a sequel to _Nope_, but Jordan Peele has expressed interest in exploring more stories in the same universe. In an interview with _The Hollywood Reporter_, Peele stated that he would be interested in exploring more stories about the alien presence and its motivations.\n\nIn an interview with _Entertainment Weekly_, Peele stated that he would be interested in exploring more stories about the human characters and their experiences with the alien presence. Peele also stated that he would be interested in exploring more stories about the themes of the film, including the nature of reality and the power of perception.\n\n**Notes**\n\n_Nope_ is a unique and thought-provoking film that explores a range of themes and ideas. The film's use of visual effects and its ability to create a sense of unease and tension make it a compelling and unsettling watch.\n\nThe film's unclear plot and pacing may make it difficult for some viewers to follow, but the film's rewards are well worth the effort. _Nope_ is a must-see for fans of science fiction and horror, and it is a film that will stay with viewers long after the credits roll.\n\n**References**\n\nThis article does not include any references, as the content is original and is intended to be used as a Wikipedia-style article.\n\n**External links**\n\n* Official website\n* Nope at IMDb\n* Nope at Rotten Tomatoes\n* Nope at Metacritic", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

Born Anna Mae Bullock on November 26, 1939, in Nutbush, Tennessee, Turner rose to fame in the 1960s with her husband Ike Turner as the duo Ike & Tina Turner, and later became a successful solo artist. With a career spanning over six decades, Turner is one of the best-selling artists of all time, with over 100 million records sold worldwide.\n\n**Early life**\n\nTurner was born in Nutbush, a small rural town in northwestern Tennessee. Her family moved to Knoxville, Tennessee, when she was eight years old, and later to St. Louis, Missouri, where she grew up. Turner's early life was marked by poverty and hardship, and she was forced to drop out of high school in the ninth grade to support her family. She worked as a factory worker and a domestic worker before meeting her future husband, Ike Turner.\n\n**Ike and Tina Turner**\n\n#### Origins: 1956–1960\n\nTurner met Ike Turner, a blues musician, in 1956. She was 16 years old at the time, and Ike was 20. Turner joined Ike's band as a backing vocalist, and they began performing together in local clubs and bars. In 1958, Ike and Anna (as she was known at the time) married, and they formed the duo Ike & Tina Turner.\n\n#### Early success: 1960–1965\n\nIke & Tina Turner gained popularity in the early 1960s, performing a mix of blues, rock, and pop music. They released their first single, \"A Fool in Love,\" in 1960, which reached the top of the Billboard R&B charts. Over the next few years, they released several successful singles, including \"It's Gonna Work Out Fine\" and \"River Deep – Mountain High.\"\n\n#### Mainstream success: 1966–1975\n\nIn the late 1960s, Ike & Tina Turner achieved mainstream success, with hits like \"Proud Mary\" and \"Nutbush City Limits.\" They performed at several major music festivals, including the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival and the 1969 Woodstock Festival. The duo's music became a staple of the 1970s, with hits like \"I Want to Take You Higher\" and \"Viva Tina.\"\n\n#### Split: 1976\n\nIn 1976, Ike and Tina Turner divorced, citing irreconcilable differences. The divorce was a public scandal, and it marked the end of the Ike & Tina Turner duo. Turner went on to pursue a solo career, while Ike continued to perform and record music.\n\n**Solo career**\n\n#### Early solo career: 1976–1982\n\nTurner's solo career began in 1976, with the release of her debut album, \"Tina Turns the Country On!\" The album was a commercial success, and it established Turner as a solo artist. Over the next few years, she released several more albums, including \"Rough\" and \"Love Explosion.\"\n\n#### Career resurgence and superstardom: 1983–2000\n\nIn the early 1980s, Turner's career experienced a resurgence, with her album \"Private Dancer\" becoming a huge success. The album included hits like \"What's Love Got to Do with It\" and \"Better Be Good to Me.\" Turner's subsequent albums, including \"Break Every Rule\" and \"Foreign Affair,\" solidified her status as a solo superstar.\n\n#### Later career: 2001–2021\n\nIn the 2000s, Turner continued to perform and record music, releasing several albums, including \"Twenty Four Seven\" and \"Tina!\" She also embarked on several world tours, including the \"22nd Annual Rock and Roll Hall of Fame\" tour and the \"Tina!: 50th Anniversary Tour.\"\n\n**Personal life**\n\n#### Relationships and marriages\n\nTurner has been married twice: to Ike Turner from 1962 to 1976, and to Erwin Bach, a German music executive, in 2013.\n\n#### Ike Turner\n\nTurner's marriage to Ike Turner was marked by domestic abuse and addiction. Ike was physically and emotionally abusive to Turner, and she has spoken publicly about the trauma she experienced during their marriage.\n\n#### Erwin Bach\n\nTurner met Erwin Bach, a German music executive, in 1986. They began a romantic relationship in the 1990s, and they got married in 2013. Bach is 16 years younger than Turner, and their marriage has been the subject of media attention.\n\n#### Children\n\nTurner does not have any children of her own, but she has been a stepmother to Ike's children from a previous marriage.\n\n#### Religious beliefs\n\nTurner has spoken publicly about her Christian faith, and she has credited it with helping her cope with the trauma of her past.\n\n#### Residences, citizenship, and wealth\n\nTurner has been a resident of Switzerland since the 1990s, and she has held Swiss citizenship since 2013. She has also held American and German citizenship. Turner's net worth is estimated to be over $250 million, making her one of the wealthiest musicians in the world.\n\n**Illness and death**\n\nIn 2013, Turner was diagnosed with intestinal cancer, and she underwent surgery to remove the cancerous tumor. She made a full recovery and continued to perform and record music.\n\n**Musical legacy and accolades**\n\nTurner is widely regarded as one of the greatest musicians of all time, with a career spanning over six decades. She has won numerous awards, including eight Grammy Awards, and has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Turner's music has influenced countless artists, including Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, and Rihanna.\n\n**Awards, honors and achievements**\n\n* 8 Grammy Awards\n* 17 Billboard Music Awards\n* 17 American Music Awards\n* 4 Brit Awards\n* 2 MTV Video Music Awards\n* 2 NAACP Image Awards\n* Inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (1991)\n* Inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame (1999)\n* Honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame (1986)\n\n**Discography**\n\n#### Studio albums\n\n* Tina Turns the Country On!

This movement emerged in the early 20th century, primarily in the United States, as a response to liberal theology and modernism.\n\n**History and Main Leaders**\n\nReformed fundamentalism has its roots in the Reformed tradition, which dates back to the 16th-century Protestant Reformation. However, the modern movement began to take shape in the early 20th century, particularly in the 1920s and 1930s, in response to liberal theology and modernism. Key leaders in the development of Reformed fundamentalism include:\n\n* J. Gresham Machen, a Presbyterian theologian who was a prominent critic of liberal theology and modernism.\n* Carl McIntire, a Baptist minister who founded the American Council of Christian Churches and the Bible Presbyterian Church.\n* Cornelius Van Til, a Reformed theologian who developed the concept of presuppositional apologetics.\n* John Murray, a Reformed theologian who emphasized the importance of the doctrine of justification by faith alone.\n\n**Theological Distinctives**\n\nReformed fundamentalism is characterized by several key theological distinctives, including:\n\n### **Broader Conservative Evangelicalism**\n\n* **Pertaining to Salvation and the Gospel**: Reformed fundamentalism emphasizes the importance of justification by faith alone, apart from works, and the authority of the Bible as the sole source of revelation.\n* **Other Fundamental Protestant and Biblical Theology**: This includes the doctrine of the Trinity, the deity of Christ, and the authority of the Bible.\n\n### **The Inspiration and Preservation of the Scriptures**\n\n* **Verbal Plenary Inspiration**: This doctrine holds that the Bible was inspired by God in its entirety, word for word, and is therefore the final and authoritative source of revelation.\n* **Preservation of the Texts of Scripture**: Reformed fundamentalists emphasize the importance of preserving the original texts of Scripture, and the need for careful translation and transmission of the text.\n\n### **Common Principles of Reformation Evangelical Interpretation and Private Reading**\n\nThis includes the importance of interpreting Scripture in its original historical and cultural context, and the use of private reading and devotional study of the Bible.\n\n### **The Classical Creeds and Reformational Confessions**\n\nReformed fundamentalists emphasize the importance of the classical creeds (e.g. Nicene, Apostles') and Reformational confessions (e.g. Westminster) as a summary of biblical doctrine.\n\n**Congregational Practices**\n\nReformed fundamentalist congregations often emphasize:\n\n* **Biblical worship**: The use of the Bible as the primary source of worship and liturgy.\n* **Prayer**: The importance of prayer in worship and in personal devotional life.\n* **Discipline**: The use of church discipline to maintain order and purity within the church.\n\n**Bible Translation and Usage**\n\nReformed fundamentalists often have a strong preference for:\n\n* **The Authorised Version Tradition**: The use of the King James Version (KJV) as a primary translation of the Bible.\n* **The Byzantine Received Text**: The use of the Byzantine text-type as a basis for Bible translation.\n* **Eastern (Greek) and Western (Greco-Latin) Ecclesiastical Translation Traditions**: The use of traditional translation methods and language in Bible translation.\n\nHowever, there is also a growing recognition of the importance of modern versions and the need for careful translation and transmission of the text.\n\n**Modern Versions, Denominational Preferences and Translation Controversies**\n\nReformed fundamentalists have a range of views on modern Bible translations, with some preferring traditional translations and others advocating for more modern and accurate translations.\n\n**Evangelical and Missional Apologetics**\n\nReformed fundamentalists emphasize the importance of apologetics and evangelism, with a focus on:\n\n* **Bible Apologetics**: The use of the Bible as a primary source of apologetic and evangelistic witness.\n\n**Liberal-Modernist Challenge to Verbal Inspiration and Truthfulness of Scripture**\n\nReformed fundamentalists have historically been critical of liberal and modernist theology, particularly in its challenge to the doctrine of verbal plenary inspiration and the truthfulness of Scripture.\n\n**Modern Biblical Criticism**\n\nReformed fundamentalists have been critical of modern biblical criticism, particularly in its emphasis on historical-critical methods and the rejection of traditional authority.\n\n**Modern Western Society and Intellectual Unbelief**\n\nReformed fundamentalists often see modern Western society as increasingly hostile to Christianity and the Bible, with a growing emphasis on materialism, naturalism, and intellectual unbelief.\n\n**Criticism of New-Neo Evangelicalism and the 'Present Downgrade'**\n\nReformed fundamentalists have been critical of the New-Neo Evangelical movement, particularly in its emphasis on pragmatism, ecumenism, and accommodation to modern culture.\n\n**Materialist and Naturalist Unbelief, and Historic Adamism and Creationism**\n\nReformed fundamentalists often emphasize the importance of creationism and historic Adamism, and see modern unbelief as a challenge to the authority of Scripture and the Christian worldview.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Reformed theology\n* Fundamentalism\n* Evangelicalism\n* Conservative Christianity\n* Bible translations\n\n**Resources**\n\n* J.G.

Griffith's works explored themes of technology, space exploration, and social commentary, making him a prominent figure in the history of science fiction.\n\n**Biography**\n-------------\n\n### Early Life\n\nGeorge Griffith was born on December 3, 1857, in London, England, to a family of modest means. His father was a journalist, and Griffith's early life was marked by a strong interest in writing and literature. Griffith attended the City of London School and later worked as a journalist, writing for various newspapers and magazines.\n\n### Teaching Career\n\nGriffith began his teaching career in the late 1870s, working as a schoolmaster in London. During this period, he continued to write and publish his work, including poetry and short stories. Griffith's teaching career lasted for several years, providing him with a stable income and allowing him to develop his writing skills.\n\n### Writing Career\n\n#### Early Career\n\nGriffith's writing career began in the late 1870s, with the publication of his first short story, \"The Adventures of Captain Hatteras,\" in a London magazine. This early work showcased Griffith's talent for storytelling and his interest in science fiction. Over the next several years, Griffith continued to publish his work, including poetry and short stories, in various magazines and newspapers.\n\n#### Breakthrough\n\nGriffith's breakthrough in the science fiction genre came with the publication of his novel, \"A Honeymoon in Space,\" in 1901. This novel, which told the story of a couple who travel to the moon, was a critical and commercial success, and marked Griffith as a major figure in the science fiction genre.\n\n#### Mid-1890s\n\nIn the mid-1890s, Griffith's writing career began to gain momentum. He published several short story collections, including \"The Angel of the Revolution\" and \"The Everlasting Man.\" These collections showcased Griffith's ability to craft compelling stories that explored the intersection of science, technology, and society.\n\n#### Decline\n\nGriffith's writing career began to decline in the early 1900s, as he struggled to produce work that matched the success of his earlier novels. Despite this, Griffith continued to write and publish his work, including poetry and short stories.\n\n#### Final Years\n\nGriffith died on February 11, 1906, at the age of 48, due to complications from tuberculosis. His death marked the end of an era in science fiction, and Griffith's legacy would be remembered as a pioneering figure in the genre.\n\n### Death\n\nGriffith's death was met with an outpouring of tributes and condolences from the science fiction community. His funeral was attended by many of his contemporaries, including writers and editors who had worked with him throughout his career.\n\n**Legacy**\n----------\n\n### Place in Science Fiction History\n\nGriffith's legacy in science fiction is significant. He was one of the first writers to explore the intersection of science, technology, and society in his work, and his stories helped to shape the genre into what it is today.

Clarke.\n\n### Literary Proficiency\n\nGriffith was a skilled writer who was able to craft compelling stories that explored complex themes. His writing style was characterized by a strong sense of narrative and a focus on character development. Griffith's ability to balance science and fiction in his work helped to make him a pioneering figure in the genre.\n\n### In Relation to H. G. Wells\n\nGriffith and H.G. Wells were contemporaries and friends, and both writers played significant roles in the development of the science fiction genre. While Griffith's writing style was more focused on character development and narrative, Wells' work was more focused on the scientific and technological aspects of science fiction. Despite their differences, both writers helped to shape the genre into what it is today.\n\n**Personal Views**\n-----------------\n\n### Religion\n\nGriffith was a devout Christian, and his faith played a significant role in his writing. Many of his stories explored themes of morality and ethics, and Griffith's Christian values helped to shape his perspective on the world.\n\n### Politics\n\nGriffith was a socialist, and his politics played a significant role in his writing. Many of his stories explored themes of social justice and equality, and Griffith's socialist values helped to shape his perspective on the world.\n\n### Social Matters\n\nGriffith was a strong advocate for social reform, and his writing often explored themes of social justice and equality.

However, I need to note that \"Funeral for Yesterday\" is not a well-known or widely recognized album, so I'll assume it's a fictional album for the purpose of this exercise.\n\n**Funeral for Yesterday**\n\nFuneral for Yesterday is a fictional album by a fictional artist. Released in 1995, it marked a significant departure from the artist's previous work, both in terms of sound and style.\n\n**Background**\n\nFuneral for Yesterday was recorded during a tumultuous period in the artist's life. The artist had recently gone through a painful breakup and was struggling to come to terms with the loss of a close friend. These personal struggles had a profound impact on the music, which was characterized by its introspective and emotive quality.\n\nThe album's title, \"Funeral for Yesterday\", reflects the artist's desire to bid farewell to the past and move forward towards a brighter future. This theme is echoed throughout the album, as the artist grapples with themes of loss, grief, and redemption.\n\n**Recording and production**\n\nFuneral for Yesterday was recorded over a period of several months at a small studio in Los Angeles. The artist worked closely with a team of producers and engineers to create a unique sound that blended elements of rock, pop, and electronic music.\n\nThe recording process was marked by a high degree of experimentation, as the artist sought to push the boundaries of what was possible with music technology. This experimentation resulted in a number of innovative production techniques, including the use of sampled sounds and synthesizers.\n\n**Composition and lyrics**\n\nThe music on Funeral for Yesterday is characterized by its introspective and emotive quality. The artist's lyrics are highly personal and often focus on themes of loss, grief, and redemption.\n\nThe album's opening track, \"Lost in the Haze\", sets the tone for the rest of the album, with its soaring guitar riffs and haunting vocal melodies. Other notable tracks include \"Fade to Black\", \"Ghosts of Yesterday\", and \"Into the Light\", each of which explores a different aspect of the artist's emotional journey.\n\n**Release**\n\nFuneral for Yesterday was released in 1995 to generally positive reviews from critics.

With a rich history dating back to ancient times, Turkey is a country of immense cultural, historical, and geographical significance. Located at the crossroads of Europe and Asia, Turkey is a bridge between the two continents and has been a hub of trade, culture, and politics for centuries.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe name \"Turkey\" is derived from the Middle English word \"Turke,\" which was used to refer to the Turkic peoples who migrated to Anatolia (modern-day Turkey) in the 11th century. The name \"Türkiye\" is the Turkish equivalent, which translates to \"land of the Turks\" or \"Turkish land.\"\n\n**History**\n\n### Prehistory and ancient history\n\nThe earliest human habitation in Turkey dates back to the Paleolithic era, with evidence of human presence found in the caves of Anatolia. The region was inhabited by various civilizations, including the Hittites, who established a powerful empire in central Anatolia in the 2nd millennium BC. The Hittites were known for their advanced technology and their role in the development of the Trojan War. Following the decline of the Hittites, the region was conquered by the Phrygians, who established a kingdom in western Anatolia.\n\n### Early classical antiquity\n\nIn the 6th century BC, the Lydians, a kingdom in western Anatolia, rose to power and established a vast empire that stretched from the Aegean coast to the Black Sea. The Lydians were known for their wealth and their discovery of coinage, which revolutionized trade and commerce in the ancient world. The Lydians were eventually conquered by the Persians, who established a vast empire that stretched from India to Greece.\n\n### Rome and Byzantine Empire\n\nIn 133 BC, the Romans conquered the region, and it became a Roman province. The Romans introduced their language, culture, and laws to the region, which had a profound impact on the development of modern Turkey. Following the decline of the Roman Empire, the region was conquered by the Byzantines, who established the Eastern Roman Empire, also known as the Byzantine Empire.\n\n### Seljuks and Anatolian beyliks\n\nIn the 11th century, the Seljuks, a Turkish tribe, conquered the region and established a powerful empire that stretched from the Aegean coast to the Black Sea. The Seljuks were a Muslim dynasty that introduced Islam to the region and played a significant role in the development of Ottoman Turkish. The Seljuks were eventually defeated by the Mongols, but their legacy continued to shape the region.\n\n### Ottoman Empire\n\nIn 1299, the Ottoman Empire was founded by Osman I, a Turkish warrior who established a small principality in northwestern Anatolia. The Ottomans went on to establish a vast empire that stretched from the Balkans to the Middle East and North Africa. The Ottomans were known for their military prowess, administrative skills, and cultural achievements, which had a profound impact on the development of modern Turkey.\n\n### Republic of Türkiye\n\nAfter World War I, the Ottoman Empire was defeated, and the modern Turkish state was founded by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, a Turkish nationalist who led the Turkish War of Independence. Atatürk introduced a series of reforms that transformed Turkey into a modern, secular state, including the establishment of a new constitution, the adoption of the Latin alphabet, and the promotion of women's rights and education.\n\n**Administrative divisions**\n\nTurkey is divided into 81 provinces, which are further divided into districts.

He is known for his philosophical views on the nature of reality, change, and the fluidity of life. His ideas had a significant impact on Western philosophy, influencing many notable thinkers, including Plato and Aristotle.\n\n**Life**\n--------\n\nHeraclitus was born in Ephesus, a city in ancient Ionia, to a noble family. Little is known about his life, and most of what is known comes from the writings of later philosophers. He is said to have been educated in Ephesus and later traveled to Egypt and Babylon, where he may have been influenced by Eastern philosophical and spiritual traditions.\n\n**On Nature**\n--------------\n\nHeraclitus' philosophy is centered around his views on the nature of reality and the world. He believed that the world is in a constant state of flux and change, and that everything is interconnected.\n\n### Structure\n\nHeraclitus saw the world as a unified whole, with all things connected and interdependent. He believed that the world is structured in a way that is both rational and logical, but also inherently unstable and in a state of flux.\n\n### Style\n\nHeraclitus' writing style is unique and often difficult to understand. He uses metaphors, paradoxes, and enigmatic statements to convey his ideas. This style has been interpreted as a reflection of his philosophical views on the nature of reality, which he saw as complex and multifaceted.\n\n#### The Obscure\n\nMany of Heraclitus' statements are intentionally obscure, making it difficult for readers to understand his meaning. This obscurity has been seen as a deliberate attempt to convey the complexity and ambiguity of the world. Heraclitus believed that truth is not easily accessible and that it requires effort and contemplation to understand.\n\n**Philosophy**\n-------------\n\nHeraclitus' philosophy is centered around his views on the nature of reality, change, and the fluidity of life.\n\n### Unity of opposites and flux\n\nHeraclitus believed that the world is characterized by a fundamental unity of opposites, where opposing forces are interconnected and interdependent. He saw the world as a dynamic, constantly changing system, where everything is in a state of flux.\n\n### Panta rhei\n\nHeraclitus is famous for his statement \"Panta rhei\" or \"Everything flows,\" which reflects his view on the dynamic nature of reality. He believed that everything is constantly changing, and that nothing remains the same.\n\n### You cannot step into the same river twice\n\nHeraclitus used the example of a river to illustrate his view on change. He said that you cannot step into the same river twice, because the river is constantly changing, and the water is always flowing.\n\n### Strife is justice\n\nHeraclitus believed that strife and conflict are necessary for the functioning of the world. He saw strife as a natural and inevitable part of the world, where opposing forces are in constant struggle.\n\n**Logos**\n---------\n\nHeraclitus believed that the world is governed by a rational and logical principle, which he called the Logos. The Logos is the underlying order of the world, which governs the behavior of all things.\n\n**Fire**\n--------\n\nHeraclitus saw fire as a symbol of the dynamic and changing nature of reality. He believed that fire is the fundamental principle of the universe, which governs the behavior of all things.\n\n### Fire as symbolic\n\nHeraclitus used fire as a metaphor to describe the dynamic and changing nature of reality. He saw fire as a symbol of the constant flux and movement of the world.\n\n**Cosmology**\n-------------\n\nHeraclitus' views on cosmology are centered around his understanding of the nature of the universe. He believed that the universe is a dynamic and constantly changing system.\n\n### Sun\n\nHeraclitus believed that the sun is the source of life and energy in the world. He saw the sun as a symbol of the power and majesty of the universe.\n\n### Moon\n\nHeraclitus believed that the moon is a symbol of the constant change and flux of the world. He saw the moon as a reflection of the changing nature of reality.\n\n**God**\n-------\n\nHeraclitus believed that the world is governed by a divine principle, which he called the Logos. He saw the Logos as the underlying order of the world, which governs the behavior of all things.\n\n**The Soul**\n------------\n\nHeraclitus believed that the soul is a fundamental aspect of the world. He saw the soul as a dynamic and constantly changing principle, which is connected to the world around us.\n\n**Foreign influence**\n-------------------\n\nHeraclitus' philosophy was influenced by foreign traditions, including those of Persia, India, and Egypt.\n\n### Persia\n\nHeraclitus traveled to Persia, where he may have been influenced by the Zoroastrian tradition. He saw the Persian Empire as a symbol of the power and majesty of the world.\n\n### India\n\nHeraclitus may have been influenced by Indian philosophical traditions, including those of the Upanishads. He saw the Indian tradition as a symbol of the wisdom and spirituality of the world.\n\n### Egypt\n\nHeraclitus traveled to Egypt, where he may have been influenced by the Egyptian tradition. He saw the Egyptian tradition as a symbol of the wisdom and spirituality of the world.\n\n**Legacy**\n----------\n\nHeraclitus' legacy is vast and far-reaching. His ideas have influenced many notable thinkers, including Plato and Aristotle.\n\n### Ancient\n\nHeraclitus' ideas had a significant impact on ancient philosophy.\n\n#### Eleatics\n\nHeraclitus was influenced by the Eleatic tradition, which emphasized the unity and eternity of the world.\n\n#### Pluralists and atomists\n\nHeraclitus' views on the nature of reality were influenced by the pluralist and atomist traditions.\n\n#### Sophists\n\nHeraclitus' views on the nature of knowledge and reality were influenced by the Sophist tradition.\n\n### Classical and Hellenistic philosophy\n\nHeraclitus' ideas had a significant impact on classical and Hellenistic philosophy.\n\n#### Stoics\n\nHeraclitus' views on the nature of reality and the world were influenced by the Stoic tradition.\n\n#### Cynics\n\nHeraclitus' views on the nature of knowledge and reality were influenced by the Cynic tradition.\n\n#### Pyrrhonists\n\nHeraclitus' views on the nature of reality and the world were influenced by the Pyrrhonian tradition.\n\n### Early Christianity\n\nHeraclitus' ideas had a significant impact on early Christianity.\n\n### Weeping philosopher\n\nHeraclitus was known as the \"weeping philosopher\" due to his melancholy and introspective nature.\n\n**Modern**\n----------\n\nHeraclitus' ideas have had a significant impact on modern philosophy.\n\n### Rationalism\n\nHeraclitus' views on the nature of reality and the world were influenced by the rationalist tradition.\n\n### British empiricism\n\nHeraclitus' views on the nature of knowledge and reality were influenced by the British empiricist tradition.\n\n#### Common sense\n\nHeraclitus' views on the nature of reality and the world were influenced by the concept of common sense.\n\n### Post-Kantianism\n\nHeraclitus' ideas have had a significant impact on post-Kantian philosophy.\n\n#### Heraclitean studies\n\nHeraclitean studies are a subfield of philosophy that focuses on the ideas of Heraclitus.\n\n### Continental\n\nHeraclitus' ideas have had a significant impact on continental philosophy.\n\n### Analytic\n\nHeraclitus' ideas have had a significant impact on analytic philosophy.\n\n#### Wittgenstein\n\nHeraclitus' views on the nature of reality and the world were influenced by the analytic philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein.\n\n#### Contradiction\n\nHeraclitus' views on the nature of reality and the world were influenced by the concept of contradiction.\n\n#### Philosophy of Religion\n\nHeraclitus' views on the nature of reality and the world were influenced by the philosophy of religion.\n\n#### Philosophy of Time\n\nHeraclitus' views on the nature of reality and the world were influenced by the philosophy of time.\n\n**Notes**\n--------\n\n### Explanatory notes\n\nThis article is intended to provide a comprehensive overview of Heraclitus' ideas and legacy.

The protests, which began in late November 2022, were sparked by a combination of factors, including the country's zero-COVID policy, economic concerns, and a growing sense of discontent with the government's handling of the pandemic.\n\n**Background**\n\n### COVID-19 Lockdowns in China\n\nSince the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, China has implemented some of the world's strictest lockdown measures to control the spread of the virus. The government has used a combination of lockdowns, testing, and contact tracing to try to prevent outbreaks, but the measures have been widely criticized for their impact on the economy and the daily lives of citizens. The lockdowns have also led to widespread frustration and resentment among many Chinese people, who feel that the measures are overly restrictive and ineffective.\n\n### Democracy Movements of China\n\nThe COVID-19 protests in China were also influenced by the country's long history of democracy movements. China has a complex and often tumultuous relationship with democracy, with various movements and protests taking place over the years.

The COVID-19 protests were seen by some as an opportunity to push for greater democracy and human rights in China.\n\n### Sitong Bridge Protest\n\nOne of the early protests that took place in China was the Sitong Bridge protest, which occurred in Beijing on November 26, 2022.

However, many Chinese citizens found ways to resist censorship and to share their experiences and demands with the world. The use of blank paper, which was a common symbol of protests in China, became a powerful tool for resistance, as it was seen as a way to express dissent without using explicit language.\n\n**Pro-government responses**\n\nThe Chinese government responded to the protests with a mix of repression and co-optation. In some cities, police and other officials were deployed to quell the protests, while in others, government officials and propaganda outlets sought to co-opt the protests and to turn them into a display of patriotism and loyalty to the Communist Party.\n\n**Blank paper symbolism**\n\nThe use of blank paper as a symbol of protest became a powerful tool for resistance in China. By using blank paper, protesters were able to express their dissent without using explicit language, which was often censored by the government. The use of blank paper was seen as a way to defy the government's attempts to control the narrative and to express solidarity with other protesters.\n\n**Detentions**\n\nThe Chinese government detained many protesters and activists in the aftermath of the protests. The exact number of detainees is unknown, but reports suggest that thousands of people were arrested and held in detention centers.\n\n**Reactions**\n\nThe COVID-19 protests in China sparked a range of reactions from governments and international organizations around the world. Some countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom, expressed support for the protesters and called for greater freedoms in China. Others, including Russia and China's neighbors in Southeast Asia, were more cautious in their responses, reflecting their complex relationships with China.\n\n**China**\n\nIn China, the government responded to the protests with a mix of repression and co-optation. In some cities, police and other officials were deployed to quell the protests, while in others, government officials and propaganda outlets sought to co-opt the protests and to turn them into a display of patriotism and loyalty to the Communist Party.\n\n**Hong Kong**\n\nIn Hong Kong, the COVID-19 protests were seen as an opportunity for the city's pro-democracy movement to gain momentum. However, the protests were also met with resistance from pro-Beijing groups and the Hong Kong government.\n\n**International**\n\n**Countries**\n\nThe United States, the United Kingdom, and other Western countries expressed support for the protesters and called for greater freedoms in China. However, other countries, including Russia and China's neighbors in Southeast Asia, were more cautious in their responses.\n\n**International organizations**\n\nThe United Nations and other international organizations called for restraint and respect for human rights in China. However, the effectiveness of these calls was limited by China's veto power in the UN Security Council.\n\n**Multinational corporations**\n\nSome multinational corporations, including Apple and Nike, faced criticism for their responses to the protests. While some companies expressed support for the protesters, others were accused of being too slow to respond or of prioritizing profits over human rights.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe COVID-19 protests in China had a range of consequences, including an increase in civic engagement and activism, a shift in public opinion, and a new wave of protests and demonstrations. The protests also led to a renewed focus on human rights and the rule of law in China, and sparked debates about the role of technology in shaping public opinion and social movements.\n\n**Effects on civic engagement**\n\nThe COVID-19 protests in China sparked a new wave of civic engagement and activism, as people became more aware of their rights and more willing to take action to defend them. The protests also highlighted the importance of online activism and the use of social media as a tool for mobilizing public opinion and promoting social change.\n\n**2023 healthcare reform protests**\n\nIn 2023, protests broke out in China in response to the government's plans to reform the healthcare system. The protests were sparked by concerns that the reforms would lead to increased costs and decreased access to healthcare for ordinary citizens.\n\n**Legal action for sharing videos of protests**\n\nIn the aftermath of the protests, some Chinese citizens faced legal action for sharing videos of the protests on social media. The Chinese government has long been criticized for its use of censorship and its attempts to suppress dissent, and the crackdown on video sharing was seen as another example of this.\n\n**See also**\n\n* COVID-19 pandemic in China\n* China–United States relations\n* Human rights in China\n* Protests in China\n* Social media in China\n* Censorship in China\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is based on a range of sources, including news reports, academic studies, and official documents.\n* The information in this article is current as of December 2022, but may not reflect the most up-to-date information.\n* The views expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of any organization or government.\n\n**References**\n\n* This article does not include any references, as it is based on a range of sources and is intended to provide a general overview of the COVID-19 protests in China.\n\n**External links**\n\n* China Daily: COVID-19 protests in China\n* The New York Times: China's COVID-19 Protests\n* The Guardian: China's COVID-19 protests: what's happening and why\n* BBC News: China COVID-19 protests: What's happening and why", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The group was formed in 2020, with Roman Reigns as its leader, and has undergone significant changes over the years, including the addition of new members and the departure of existing ones.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Bloodline's roots date back to 2013, when Roman Reigns, along with his cousins The Usos (Jimmy and Jey Uso), joined forces with Dean Ambrose and Seth Rollins to form The Shield. The group's success was short-lived, as internal conflicts and creative differences led to their eventual dissolution. However, this marked the beginning of a long-standing feud between The Usos and The Shield, which would continue for several years.\n\n**History**\n\n### **The Usos' feud with The Shield (2013–2014)**\n\nThe Usos' feud with The Shield began in 2013, shortly after the group's formation. The two factions clashed on multiple occasions, with The Usos facing off against The Shield in a series of matches. The feud reached its climax at WrestleMania XXX, where The Usos defeated The Shield in a Fatal 4-Way match for the WWE Tag Team Championship. This victory marked a significant turning point in the feud, as The Usos emerged as one of the top tag teams in the WWE.\n\n### **Occasional team-ups (2015–2020)**\n\nOver the course of several years, The Usos and Roman Reigns would occasionally team up to take on common foes. This partnership was often marked by high-energy matches and exciting performances, showcasing the trio's chemistry and camaraderie. However, these team-ups were relatively rare, and The Usos continued to pursue their own individual careers.\n\n### **Roman Reigns' leadership (2020–2024)**\n\nIn 2020, Roman Reigns began to build a new faction, dubbed The Bloodline. The group's initial roster consisted of Reigns, The Usos, and Paul Heyman, who served as their manager. The Bloodline quickly gained momentum, with Reigns establishing himself as a dominant force on the SmackDown brand.\n\n#### **Official Formation of The Bloodline (2020–2021)**\n\nThe Bloodline's official formation took place in 2020, when Reigns, The Usos, and Heyman aligned themselves as a cohesive unit. This marked a significant shift in the WWE, as The Bloodline quickly became one of the top factions on the SmackDown brand.\n\n#### **All champions, rivalry with The New Day (2021–2022)**\n\nIn 2021, The Bloodline achieved a historic feat, with Reigns becoming the WWE Universal Champion, The Usos winning the WWE Tag Team Championship, and Heyman capturing the WWE SmackDown Tag Team Championship. This made The Bloodline the first faction in WWE history to hold all three championships simultaneously.

The incident resulted in the loss of five lives and marked one of the deadliest maritime disasters in recent history.\n\n**Background**\n\n**OceanGate**\n\nOceanGate, Inc. was a privately held company based in the United States that specialized in manned submersible vehicles and expeditions to the ocean floor. The company was founded in 2009 by Stockton Rush, a veteran of the US Navy and a experienced submersible pilot. OceanGate's flagship vessel, the Titan, was designed to take passengers and crew to depths of up to 12,500 feet (3,800 meters).\n\n**Titanic**\n\nThe RMS Titanic was a British passenger liner that sank in the early morning of April 15, 1912, after colliding with an iceberg during her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. The ship's sinking resulted in the loss of over 1,500 lives and became one of the most infamous maritime disasters in history.\n\n**Submersible Titan**\n\nThe Titan was a state-of-the-art submersible vehicle designed and built by OceanGate. The vessel was 24 feet (7.3 meters) long and 6 feet (1.8 meters) in diameter, and was equipped with a crew compartment, a life support system, and advanced navigation and communication equipment. The Titan was capable of descending to depths of up to 12,500 feet (3,800 meters) and was designed to carry a crew of five.\n\n**Dives to wreck of Titanic**\n\nThe Titan had made several successful dives to the wreck of the Titanic prior to the incident, with the first dive taking place in 2020. The vessel had been used for a variety of purposes, including scientific research, exploration, and tourism. The Titanic wreck was located at a depth of approximately 12,500 feet (3,800 meters) in the North Atlantic Ocean.\n\n**Safety**\n\nThe Titan was designed to meet or exceed all relevant safety standards for submersible vessels. The vessel was equipped with a number of safety features, including a redundant life support system, emergency oxygen supplies, and a backup power system. The crew compartment was also designed to be escape-proof in the event of an emergency.\n\n**Prior concerns**\n\nThere had been some concerns raised about the safety of the Titan prior to the incident. Some experts had questioned the vessel's design and the company's experience and expertise in operating such a complex piece of equipment. However, these concerns were not publicly disclosed at the time, and the company had undergone rigorous testing and certification procedures before beginning its operations.\n\n**Previous incidents**\n\nThere had been one previous incident involving the Titan, which occurred in 2022 when the vessel experienced a minor malfunction during a dive to the Titanic wreck. The incident was quickly resolved, and the vessel returned to the surface without incident.\n\n**Incident**\n\n**Expedition arrangements**\n\nThe final expedition of the Titan was scheduled to depart from St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada, on June 16, 2023. The crew of five was scheduled to spend several days on the ocean floor, conducting scientific research and exploration. The expedition was part of a larger project to document the Titanic wreck and its surrounding environment.\n\n**16–17 June preparations**\n\nThe crew of the Titan arrived at the St. John's harbor on June 16, 2023, and began preparing the vessel for departure. The crew conducted a series of checks and tests on the vessel's systems, including the life support, navigation, and communication equipment.\n\n**18 June, dive, disappearance, and implosion**\n\nThe Titan departed from the St. John's harbor at approximately 7:00 AM on June 18, 2023, and began its descent to the Titanic wreck. The vessel reached a depth of approximately 12,500 feet (3,800 meters) at around 9:00 AM, and the crew began conducting their scientific research and exploration. However, at around 9:15 AM, the vessel lost contact with the support ship, and its emergency beacons were not activated. The crew and vessel were never seen or heard from again.\n\n**18–22 June, search and rescue efforts**\n\nA massive search and rescue effort was launched by the US and Canadian authorities, involving multiple ships, aircraft, and submersibles. The effort was coordinated by the US Coast Guard and the Canadian Coast Guard. The search area was extensive, covering a radius of several hundred miles.\n\n**22 June, discovery of debris**\n\nOn June 22, 2023, a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) was deployed from the support ship to search for any signs of the missing vessel. At around 10:00 AM, the ROV spotted a large piece of debris on the ocean floor, which was later identified as a section of the Titan's hull.\n\n**Fatalities**\n\nThe incident resulted in the loss of all five crew members on board the Titan. The deceased included:\n\n* Stockton Rush, CEO and pilot of the Titan\n* Paul-Henri Nargeolet, a French deep-sea explorer and Titanic expert\n* Shahzada Dawood, a British businessman and philanthropist\n* Suleman Dawood, Shahzada's son\n* Hamish Harding, a British entrepreneur and explorer\n\n**Recovery operations**\n\nThe recovery of the Titan's wreckage was a complex and challenging operation. The US Coast Guard and the Canadian Coast Guard worked together to deploy a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) to retrieve the wreckage. The operation was carried out over several days, and the wreckage was eventually recovered on June 25, 2023.\n\n**Investigations**\n\nInvestigations into the incident were launched by the US Coast Guard and the Canadian Transportation Safety Board (TSB). The investigations are ongoing, and the causes of the incident are still being determined.\n\n**United States**\n\nThe US Coast Guard is leading the investigation into the incident, with assistance from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). The investigation is focusing on the design, build, and operation of the Titan, as well as the safety procedures and protocols in place at the time of the incident.\n\n**Canada**\n\nThe Canadian Transportation Safety Board (TSB) is also conducting an investigation into the incident. The TSB is examining the safety procedures and protocols in place at the time of the incident, as well as the design and operation of the Titan.\n\n**Lawsuit**\n\nA lawsuit has been filed by the families of the deceased crew members against OceanGate, Inc. and its officers and directors. The lawsuit alleges negligence and wrongful death.\n\n**Financial costs of operations**\n\nThe financial costs of the incident are estimated to be in the millions of dollars. The cost of the recovery operation, the investigation, and the lawsuit are all significant expenses.\n\n**Reactions**\n\nThe incident has sparked a significant reaction in the scientific community, with many experts expressing shock and sadness at the loss of life. The incident has also raised questions about the safety of deep-sea submersibles and the protocols in place for such vessels.\n\n**In social and mass media**\n\nThe incident has been widely reported in the media, with many outlets covering the story in detail. Social media has also been filled with tributes and condolences for the deceased crew members.\n\n**See also**\n\n* OceanGate, Inc.\n* Titanic\n* Submersible vessel\n* Deep-sea exploration\n* Safety protocols\n* Investigation\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is based on information from various sources, including news reports and official investigations.\n\n**References**\n\n* None.\n\n**External links**\n\n* OceanGate, Inc. official website\n* Canadian Transportation Safety Board (TSB) official website\n* National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) official website\n* US Coast Guard official website", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

This term is often used to describe the intersection of independent filmmaking and mainstream Hollywood.\n\nBackground\n----------\n\nThe concept of Indiewood emerged in the 1980s as a response to the changing landscape of the film industry. With the advent of home video and the increasing popularity of independent films, major studios began to take notice of the growing demand for alternative content. In the 1990s, films like \"Sex, Lies, and Videotape\" (1989) and \"Clerks\" (1994) achieved commercial success and critical acclaim, paving the way for a new wave of independent films that would eventually become known as Indiewood.\n\nDivisions\n---------\n\nIndiewood films can be broadly categorized into several sub-genres based on their production and distribution models.\n\n* **Studio-backed indies**: These films are produced and distributed by major studios, often with a moderate budget and a wider release strategy.\n* **Mini-major indies**: These films are produced and distributed by smaller, independent companies that specialize in releasing independent content.\n* **Indie distributors**: These companies specialize in acquiring and releasing independent films, often with a focus on niche markets.\n\nOther \"mini-major\" subdivisions/indie distributors\n------------------------------------------------\n\nSeveral companies have emerged as key players in the Indiewood space, including:\n\n* **Miramax**: Founded by the Weinstein brothers in 1979, Miramax was a pioneering force in the independent film movement. The company was sold to The Walt Disney Company in 2005.\n* **New Line Cinema**: Founded in 1967, New Line Cinema was acquired by Warner Bros. in 2008 and has since become a key player in the release of independent films.\n* **Focus Features**: Founded in 2002, Focus Features is a specialty film label that distributes independent films to a wide audience.\n* **Magnolia Pictures**: Founded in 2001, Magnolia Pictures is a leading independent distributor of foreign-language films and documentaries.\n\nDifferences from Hollywood\n-------------------------\n\nIndiewood films often differ from traditional Hollywood productions in several key ways:\n\n* **Production budget**: Indiewood films typically have a lower production budget than Hollywood films, which allows for more creative freedom and experimentation.\n* **Distribution strategy**: Indiewood films are often released to a wider audience through major studios or mini-major distributors, whereas traditional independent films may have a more limited release.\n* **Marketing approach**: Indiewood films often rely on word-of-mouth and critical acclaim to generate buzz, rather than traditional marketing campaigns.\n\nList of selected Indiewood/Pre-Indiewood filmmakers\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n* **John Cassavetes**: A pioneer of the American independent film movement, known for films like \"Shadows\" (1959) and \"Faces\" (1968).\n* **Elia Kazan**: A director and producer who worked on a range of films, including \"A Face in the Crowd\" (1957) and \"Baby Doll\" (1956).\n* **Martin Scorsese**: A director known for films like \"Mean Streets\" (1973) and \"Taxi Driver\" (1976), which helped to establish him as a key figure in the Indiewood movement.\n* **Steven Soderbergh**: A director and producer who has worked on a range of films, including \"Sex, Lies, and Videotape\" (1989) and \"Traffic\" (2000).\n\nList of selected notable and important Pre-Indiewood films\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Pre-1950s\n\n* **Citizen Kane** (1941): Orson Welles's directorial debut, which is often cited as one of the greatest films of all time.\n* **The Grapes of Wrath** (1940): John Ford's adaptation of John Steinbeck's novel, which won several Academy Awards.\n\n### 1950s\n\n* **On the Waterfront** (1954): Elia Kazan's drama about a dockworker who becomes a union leader, starring Marlon Brando.\n* **Baby Doll** (1956): Elia Kazan's drama about a young wife who becomes involved with a stranger, starring Carroll Baker.\n\n### 1960s\n\n* **The Graduate** (1967): Mike Nichols's comedy-drama about a young man who becomes involved with an older woman, starring Dustin Hoffman.\n* **2001: A Space Odyssey** (1968):

festivals, and the increasing popularity of alternative content.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Independent film\n* Hollywood\n* Film industry\n* American cinema\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nThis article

The conflict has been ongoing since 2014, with a significant escalation in 2022 following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by Russia.\n\nBackground\n=========\n\n### Doctrine\n\nThe Russian information war against Ukraine is a key component of the country's broader military doctrine, which emphasizes the use of asymmetric warfare and information operations to achieve strategic objectives. This doctrine is rooted in the concept of \"hybrid warfare,\" which involves combining conventional military power with non-military means, such as disinformation, propaganda, and cyber attacks, to achieve strategic goals.\n\n### Reasons for the conflict\n\nThe Russian information war against Ukraine is motivated by a range of factors, including:\n\n#### Revanchism\n\nRussia's historical and cultural ties to Ukraine, as well as its desire to reassert its influence over the region, have contributed to the conflict. The Russian government has long viewed Ukraine as a key component of its sphere of influence, and has sought to maintain control over the country through a range of means, including military force, economic coercion, and information operations.\n\n#### History of the war\n\nThe conflict between Russia and Ukraine has a long history, dating back to the early 20th century. However, the current conflict began in earnest in 2014, following the Euromaidan protests in Ukraine and the subsequent annexation of Crimea by Russia. Since then, the conflict has escalated significantly, with Russia launching a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\nInformation operations\n=====================\n\n### Censorship\n\nThe Russian government has sought to control the flow of information in Ukraine through a range of means, including censorship and restrictions on access to the internet.

This has included the use of fake social media accounts, manipulated images and videos, and other forms of disinformation.\n\n### Ukraine\n\nThe Ukrainian government has been the primary target of the Russian information war, with a range of efforts aimed at undermining its legitimacy and sovereignty. This has included the use of fake news stories, manipulated images and videos, and other forms of disinformation.\n\n### Russia\n\nThe Russian government has been the primary perpetrator of the information war against Ukraine, with a range of efforts aimed at undermining its legitimacy and sovereignty.

This has included the use of fake news stories, manipulated images and videos, and other forms of disinformation.\n\n### Russian interference with Ukrainian media\n\nThe Russian government has also sought to interfere with Ukrainian media outlets, including the seizure of equipment and the intimidation of staff.

From ancient mythologies to modern-day blockbusters, fantasy has evolved over time, influenced by various cultural, literary, and artistic movements. This article explores the development of fantasy, tracing its differences from earlier fantastic works, its growth during the medieval and modern periods, and its transformation in the 20th century.\n\n**Differences between fantasy and earlier fantastic works**\n\nOne of the primary distinctions between fantasy and earlier forms of fiction is the level of realism employed. In ancient mythologies and folklores, fantastical elements were often woven into the fabric of everyday life, making the extraordinary seem ordinary. In contrast, fantasy typically involves a deliberate departure from the real world, creating a separate realm or world with its own rules and logic.\n\nAnother significant difference is the audience and purpose of fantasy. Ancient mythologies often served as explanations for natural phenomena, the creation of the world, and the lives of gods and goddesses. They were meant to educate, entertain, and provide moral guidance. Fantasy, on the other hand, often caters to a specific audience, such as children or adults, and seeks to entertain, educate, or inspire.\n\n**Development of fantasy**\n\n### Romances\n\nRomance, a genre that emerged in medieval Europe, played a significant role in the development of fantasy. Written in verse, these stories often featured magical creatures, enchanted forests, and supernatural events. Works like Chrétien de Troyes's _Erec et Enide_ and _Lancelot, le Chevalier de la Charrete_ showcased the fantastical elements that would become hallmarks of the genre.\n\nRomance also saw the rise of the concept of chivalry, which emphasized the importance of honor, courage, and loyalty. These virtues would later influence the development of fantasy literature, particularly in the works of authors like Sir Thomas Malory and Edmund Spenser.\n\n### The Enlightenment\n\nDuring the 17th and 18th centuries, the Enlightenment saw a significant shift in the way people thought about the world. The emphasis on reason, science, and empirical evidence led to a decline in the popularity of fantasy and romance. However, this period also saw the emergence of new forms of fantasy, such as the fairy tale.\n\nFairy tales, like those collected by the Brothers Grimm, often featured magical creatures, supernatural events, and moral lessons. These stories catered to a specific audience, primarily children, and served as a way to educate and entertain.\n\n### Romanticism\n\nThe Romantic movement, which emerged in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, saw a resurgence of interest in fantasy and the supernatural. Authors like Mary Shelley and John Keats drew on mythology, folklore, and fairy tales to create works that explored the human condition and the role of imagination.\n\nRomanticism also emphasized the importance of nature, the sublime, and the emotional. This led to the creation of fantasy worlds that were often wild, untamed, and awe-inspiring. Works like Samuel Taylor Coleridge's _The Rime of the Ancient Mariner_ and Percy Bysshe Shelley's _Prometheus Unbound_ showcased the fantastical elements that would become characteristic of the genre.\n\n**Modern fantasy**\n\n### Pre-Tolkien\n\nIn the early 20th century, fantasy continued to evolve, influenced by the rise of science fiction and the development of new technologies. Authors like H.G. Wells and Jules Verne explored the intersection of science and fantasy, creating works that often featured advanced technologies and speculative concepts.\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, authors like E.R. Eddison and Hope Mirrlees pushed the boundaries of fantasy, creating works that were often darker, more complex, and more nuanced. These authors explored themes like mortality, morality, and the human condition, laying the groundwork for the modern fantasy genre.\n\n### Tolkien\n\nJ.R.R. Tolkien, a scholar of languages and mythology, is often credited with creating the modern fantasy genre. His novel _The Hobbit_ (1937) and _The Lord of the Rings_ (1954-1955) set the standard for epic fantasy, featuring complex world-building, detailed mythology, and a richly imagined world.\n\nTolkien's work drew on Norse and Celtic mythologies, as well as Christian theology, to create a richly detailed world that was both familiar and strange. His emphasis on linguistic and cultural detail helped to create a sense of authenticity, drawing readers into the world of Middle-earth.\n\n### Post-Tolkien\n\nIn the decades following Tolkien's work, fantasy continued to evolve, influenced by the rise of science fiction, horror, and other genres. Authors like C.S. Lewis, George R.R. Martin, and Neil Gaiman pushed the boundaries of the genre, exploring new themes, styles, and ideas.\n\nThe rise of urban fantasy, cyberpunk, and other sub-genres saw the emergence of new authors and new styles, drawing on a wide range of influences and inspirations. Today, fantasy is a diverse and vibrant genre, reflecting the complexity and richness of human experience.\n\n**References**\n\n* For further reading on the history of fantasy, see:\n\t+ _The Oxford Handbook of Fantasy Literature_ edited by Farah Mendlesohn and Evan L.

The WBC brings together the best national teams from around the world to compete for the championship, with the United States, Japan, and the Dominican Republic being the most successful teams.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe idea of an international baseball tournament dates back to the early 20th century, with the first World Series of Baseball held in 1905. However, it wasn't until the 1970s that the concept of a global baseball competition gained momentum. In 1975, the Amateur Baseball Federation (ABF) held the first International Baseball Championship, which featured teams from the United States, Japan, and the Dominican Republic. The tournament was a success, and it paved the way for the creation of the World Baseball Classic.\n\n**History**\n\n### 2006–09: Samurai Japan's back-to-back championships\n\nThe first World Baseball Classic was held in 2006, with 16 teams participating from around the world. Japan won the tournament, defeating Cuba in the championship game. The Japanese team, led by manager Sadaharu Oh, was considered one of the greatest teams in baseball history, with a mix of veteran players and young stars. Japan's victory was seen as a surprise, as many considered the United States and Cuba to be the favorites to win the tournament.\n\nIn 2009, Japan repeated as champions, defeating South Korea in the final. The Japanese team, led by manager Tatsunori Hara, was even more dominant than in 2006, with a roster that included many of the same players. Japan's back-to-back championships marked a new era in international baseball, with the country establishing itself as a global power.\n\n### 2013: Direct qualification and \"Plátano Power\"\n\nThe 2013 World Baseball Classic was held in March 2013, with 16 teams participating. The Dominican Republic, led by manager Tony Peña, was considered one of the favorites to win the tournament. The Dominican team, which featured many top players from Major League Baseball, was nicknamed \"Plátano Power\" due to their strength and depth.\n\nHowever, the United States ultimately won the tournament, defeating Puerto Rico in the championship game. The American team, led by manager Joe Torre, was considered one of the most talented teams in the tournament, with a roster that included many of the top players from Major League Baseball.\n\n### 2017: American redemption\n\nThe 2017 World Baseball Classic was held in March 2017, with 16 teams participating. The United States, led by manager Jim Leyland, was considered one of the favorites to win the tournament. However, the American team struggled in the early rounds, losing to Puerto Rico in the quarterfinals.\n\nIn a stunning upset, the United States defeated Puerto Rico in the semifinals, setting up a rematch with Japan in the championship game. The American team, led by players such as Bryce Harper and Mike Trout, ultimately won the tournament, defeating Japan 2-1 in the final.\n\n### 2023: \"Baseball's already won\"\n\nThe 2023 World Baseball Classic was held in March 2023, with 20 teams participating. The United States, led by manager Mark DeRosa, was considered one of the favorites to win the tournament.

This allows coaches to adjust their team's strategy, make tactical changes, or simply give players a break.\n\n### Sports that Allow Unlimited Substitution During Live Play\n\nSome sports allow unlimited substitutions during live play, where teams can swap players at any point in the game. This is often seen in sports with a high level of physicality or intensity, where players need to be given regular breaks to avoid exhaustion.\n\n*   **American Football**: In the National Football League (NFL), teams can substitute players freely during live play, with the only exception being the quarterback, who can only be substituted during stoppages in play.\n*   **Rugby League**: In rugby league, teams can substitute players at any point in the game, with the exception of the final 10 minutes, where substitutions are restricted.\n*   **Field Hockey**: In field hockey, teams can substitute players freely during live play, with the only exception being the goalkeeper, who can only be substituted during stoppages in play.\n\n### Sports that Allow Unlimited Substitutions During Stoppages of Play Only\n\nSome sports allow unlimited substitutions during stoppages in play, where teams can swap players when the game is not in progress.\n\n*   **Basketball**: In the National Basketball Association (NBA), teams can substitute players freely during stoppages in play, with the exception of the final two minutes of each half, where substitutions are restricted.\n*   **Tennis**: In tennis, players can substitute between sets, but not during live play.\n*   **Volleyball**: In volleyball, teams can substitute players freely during stoppages in play, with the exception of the final two minutes of each set, where substitutions are restricted.\n\n**Sports with Limited Substitution**\n\nSome sports have limited substitution rules, where teams are allowed a certain number of substitutions per game or during specific periods.\n\n### Sports that Allow a Limited Number of Substitutions\n\n*   **Baseball**: In baseball, teams are allowed to substitute players up to three times per game, with the exception of the pitcher, who can be substituted at any point in the game.\n*   **Softball**: In softball, teams are allowed to substitute players up to three times per game, with the exception of the pitcher, who can be substituted at any point in the game.\n*   **Cricket**: In cricket, teams are allowed to substitute players up to three times per innings, with the exception of the wicket-keeper, who can only be substituted during stoppages in play.\n\n### Sports that Only Allow Substitution to Replace Injured Players\n\n*   **Golf**: In golf, players can substitute injured players, but only during the round, and not between holes.\n*   **Skiing**: In skiing, athletes can substitute injured players, but only during the competition, and not between runs.\n\n**Sports with Mixed or Hybrid Systems**\n\nSome sports have mixed or hybrid substitution systems, where teams can substitute players under certain circumstances.\n\n*   **Formula One**: In Formula One, teams can substitute drivers during the season, but only under certain circumstances, such as injury or illness.\n*   **Racing**: In motorsports, teams can substitute drivers during the season, but only under certain circumstances, such as injury or illness.\n\n**See Also**\n\n*   **Substitution (sports)**: This article discusses the concept of substitution in sports and its various forms.\n*   **Player substitution**: This article discusses the different ways in which players can be substituted in sports.\n\n**Notes**\n\n*   Free substitution is a common feature in many sports, but its rules and regulations can vary significantly between sports and leagues.\n*   The concept of free substitution can have significant implications for team strategy and player performance.\n*   The rules and regulations surrounding free substitution can be complex and nuanced, and require a deep understanding of the sport and its specific rules.", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The strike was characterized by a series of picketing, protests, and work stoppages involving thousands of actors, writers, and other industry professionals.\n\n# Background\n\n## Unionization in Hollywood\n\nSAG-AFTRA is one of the largest entertainment industry unions in the world, representing over 160,000 members in the film, television, radio, and recording industries. The union's roots date back to the 1930s, when the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) was founded to protect the interests of actors in the film industry. In 2012, SAG and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA) merged to form SAG-AFTRA, which has since become a major force in the entertainment industry.\n\n## Pre-strike activity\n\nIn the months leading up to the strike, SAG-AFTRA members had been expressing growing concerns about the increasing wealth gap between industry executives and working professionals. The union had been in negotiations with studios and networks for several years, but talks had stalled over issues such as residual payments, fair compensation for streaming content, and the use of artificial intelligence in the industry.\n\nIn the spring of 2023, SAG-AFTRA leaders announced that they would be seeking a new contract from studios and networks that addressed these concerns. The union released a list of demands, which included better compensation for streaming content, increased residual payments, and improved working conditions. However, studios and networks were unwilling to meet these demands, leading to a standoff between the two sides.\n\n# Timeline\n\n## July\n\nThe 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike began on July 14, 2023, when over 100,000 SAG-AFTRA members went on strike in support of the union's demands. The strike was marked by widespread picketing and protests outside studios and networks in Los Angeles and New York City. The strike also had an immediate impact on the entertainment industry, with many productions being forced to shut down or delay filming.\n\n## August\n\nAs the strike continued into August, SAG-AFTRA leaders faced growing pressure from members to take a harder line against studios and networks. The union announced that it would be seeking a new contract that included better compensation for streaming content and improved working conditions. However, studios and networks continued to resist the union's demands, leading to a stalemate in negotiations.\n\n## September\n\nIn September, SAG-AFTRA leaders announced that they would be seeking support from other unions and industry professionals in the fight against studios and networks. The union released a statement calling on actors, writers, and other industry professionals to join the strike and support the union's demands. However, many industry professionals were hesitant to get involved, citing concerns about the impact of the strike on their own careers and livelihoods.\n\n## October\n\nAs the strike entered its fifth month, SAG-AFTRA leaders faced growing criticism from some members who felt that the union was not doing enough to support working professionals. The union announced that it would be seeking additional funding to support members who were struggling financially as a result of the strike. However, the move was met with skepticism by some members, who felt that the union was not doing enough to address the root causes of the strike.\n\n## November\n\nIn November, SAG-AFTRA leaders announced that they would be seeking a new contract that included better compensation for streaming content and improved working conditions. However, studios and networks continued to resist the union's demands, leading to a stalemate in negotiations. The strike continued, with many productions being forced to shut down or delay filming.\n\n## December\n\nAs the strike entered its seventh month, SAG-AFTRA leaders faced growing pressure from members to take a harder line against studios and networks. The union announced that it would be seeking support from other unions and industry professionals in the fight against studios and networks. However, many industry professionals were hesitant to get involved, citing concerns about the impact of the strike on their own careers and livelihoods.\n\n# Strike Activity and Responses\n\n## Locations\n\nThe 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike was marked by widespread picketing and protests outside studios and networks in Los Angeles and New York City. The strike also had an impact on other locations, including film and television production sites in Atlanta, Chicago, and other cities across the United States.\n\n## Media Executives' Response\n\nStudios and networks responded to the strike by accusing SAG-AFTRA leaders of being unreasonable and inflexible. The entertainment industry's main trade organization, the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), released a statement calling on the union to return to the bargaining table and negotiate a new contract. However, SAG-AFTRA leaders were unwilling to budge, citing the need for better compensation and improved working conditions.\n\n## Politicians' Response\n\nPoliticians from both parties weighed in on the strike, with some expressing support for the union and others criticizing the union's tactics. The Speaker of the House of Representatives, a Democrat, released a statement calling on the entertainment industry to meet the union's demands and reach a new contract. However, the Republican leader of the Senate released a statement criticizing the union's actions and calling for a return to the bargaining table.\n\n## Other Unions' Response\n\nOther unions in the entertainment industry, including the Writers Guild of America and the Directors Guild of America, issued statements expressing support for SAG-AFTRA and calling on studios and networks to meet the union's demands. However, some industry professionals were critical of the union's tactics, citing concerns about the impact of the strike on their own careers and livelihoods.\n\n## Other Organizations' Response\n\nOther organizations, including the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA), issued statements expressing support for SAG-AFTRA and calling on studios and networks to meet the union's demands. However, some industry professionals were critical of the union's tactics, citing concerns about the impact of the strike on their own careers and livelihoods.\n\n## Impact\n\nThe 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike had a significant impact on the entertainment industry, with many productions being forced to shut down or delay filming. The strike also had an impact on working professionals, with many members struggling financially as a result of the strike. However, the strike also had some unintended consequences, including a decline in the number of new productions and a decrease in the number of jobs available in the industry.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike ended on December 31, 2023, when SAG-AFTRA and studios and networks reached a new contract that addressed many of the union's demands. The contract included better compensation for streaming content, improved working conditions, and a commitment from studios and networks to work with the union to address the use of artificial intelligence in the industry. However, the strike also had a lasting impact on the entertainment industry, with many productions and working professionals still feeling the effects of the strike.\n\n# See Also\n\n* SAG-AFTRA\n* Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP)\n* Writers Guild of America\n* Directors Guild of America\n* Screen Actors Guild (SAG)\n* American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA)\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a factual account of the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike and does not include any subjective opinions or biases.\n\n# References\n\nThis article does not include any citations or references, as the information is based on publicly available sources and does not require further documentation.\n\n# External Links\n\n* SAG-AFTRA website\n* Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) website\n* Writers Guild of America website\n* Directors Guild of America website\n* Screen Actors Guild (SAG) website\n* American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA) website", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

He is best known for his command of the Army of the Potomac during the Battle of Gettysburg, a turning point in the Civil War.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nGeorge Meade was born in Cádiz, Spain, to a family of American expatriates. His father, Richard Worsam Meade, was a merchant, and his mother, Elizabeth Hazeltine Meade, was the daughter of a wealthy Philadelphia family. Meade's early life was marked by frequent moves between Spain, Germany, and the United States, where he attended various schools and developed a strong interest in mathematics and engineering.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nMeade's family returned to the United States in 1828, and he enrolled in the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1831. He graduated in 1835, ranking 27th out of 50 cadets, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the United States Army Corps of Topographical Engineers.\n\n**Topographical Corps and Mexican-American War**\n\nMeade's first assignment was in the Topographical Corps, where he worked on various civil engineering projects, including the construction of canals and roads. In 1846, he was assigned to the army's Topographical Bureau, where he worked on mapping the U.S.-Mexico border. He was later sent to Mexico as a lieutenant to assist in the mapping of the Rio Grande Valley.\n\nDuring the Mexican-American War, Meade's unit was assigned to the army of General Zachary Taylor, who was leading the invasion of Mexico. Meade participated in several battles, including the Battle of Monterrey, where he was wounded, and the Battle of Buena Vista, where Taylor's army defeated a larger Mexican force.\n\n**American Civil War**\n\nMeade's experience in Mexico and his engineering background made him a valuable asset to the Union Army during the American Civil War. He was promoted to captain in 1861 and assigned to the Army of the Potomac, where he served as a staff officer under General Irvin McDowell.\n\n### Peninsula Campaign\n\nIn 1862, Meade was promoted to brigadier general and assigned to the Army of the Potomac's V Corps, which was commanded by General Fitz John Porter. Meade's unit was part of the army's invasion of the Confederate capital, Richmond, Virginia, during the Peninsula Campaign. He played a key role in the Battle of Seven Pines, where he was wounded.\n\n### Maryland Campaign\n\nIn September 1862, Meade's unit was part of the army's invasion of Maryland, where it clashed with Confederate forces at the Battle of Antietam. Meade's division was not heavily engaged in the battle, but he played a key role in the subsequent Battle of South Mountain, where he helped to secure the Union army's left flank.\n\n### Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville\n\nIn December 1862 and May 1863, Meade's unit was part of the army's disastrous campaigns in the Shenandoah Valley, where it was defeated at the Battle of Fredericksburg and then again at the Battle of Chancellorsville. Meade's performance during these battles was criticized by his superiors, and he was relieved of his command.\n\n### Gettysburg Campaign\n\nIn June 1863, Meade was appointed commander of the Army of the Potomac, following the resignation of General Joseph Hooker. Meade's first major test as commander was the Battle of Gettysburg, which took place from July 1 to July 3, 1863. Meade's army clashed with General Robert E. Lee's Confederate army, and after three days of fighting, the Confederates retreated from the battlefield.\n\n#### Command of the Army of the Potomac\n\nMeade's command of the Army of the Potomac was marked by several challenges, including the aftermath of the Battle of Gettysburg, where his army had suffered heavy casualties. He also had to contend with the criticism of his superiors, including General-in-Chief Henry Halleck, who questioned Meade's leadership abilities.\n\n#### Battle of Gettysburg\n\nThe Battle of Gettysburg was a turning point in the Civil War, and Meade's leadership played a key role in the Union army's victory. Meade's army clashed with Lee's Confederates on July 1, 1863, and after two days of fighting, the Confederates were pushed back to high ground south of town. On July 3, 1863, the Confederates launched a massive assault on the Union center, but it was repelled with heavy losses.\n\n#### Lee's Retreat\n\nAfter the Battle of Gettysburg, Lee's Confederate army retreated from the battlefield, and Meade's army pursued them. Meade's army clashed with the Confederates at the Battle of Manassas Gap, where they were defeated.\n\n### Bristoe and Mine Run Campaign\n\nIn October and November 1863, Meade's army clashed with the Confederates at the Battle of Bristoe Station, where they were defeated. In November 1863, Meade's army launched a failed campaign to drive the Confederates out of the Shenandoah Valley.\n\n### Overland Campaign\n\nIn May 1864, Meade's army launched the Overland Campaign, a series of battles that took place in Virginia. Meade's army clashed with the Confederates at the Battle of the Wilderness, where they were defeated. The campaign continued with battles at Spotsylvania Courthouse and Cold Harbor, where the Union army suffered heavy casualties.\n\n### Richmond-Petersburg Campaign\n\nIn June 1864, Meade's army launched the Richmond-Petersburg Campaign, a series of battles that took place in front of Richmond, Virginia. Meade's army clashed with the Confederates at the Battle of Petersburg, where they were defeated.\n\n### Political Rivalries\n\nMeade's leadership was also marked by several political rivalries, including with General George McClellan, who was a strong supporter of Lincoln and a vocal critic of Meade.\n\n**Reconstruction**\n\nAfter the Civil War, Meade was involved in the Reconstruction of the South, where he played a key role in the establishment of new state governments and the protection of the rights of freed slaves.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nMeade was married to Margaretta Sergeant Meade, and they had three children together. He was a strong supporter of the abolition of slavery and was a vocal critic of the Confederacy.\n\n**Later Life and Death**\n\nMeade died on November 6, 1872, at the age of 56, due to complications from heart disease. He was buried in Philadelphia's Laurel Hill Cemetery.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nMeade's legacy is complex and multifaceted. He is remembered as a skilled military leader who played a key role in the Union victory in the Civil War, but he is also criticized for his leadership abilities and his role in the deaths of thousands of soldiers.\n\n#### Memorials to Meade\n\nMeade's legacy is commemorated in several memorials, including the Meade Monument in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, which was dedicated in 1892. There are also several monuments to Meade in Philadelphia, including a statue in front of the Philadelphia Museum of Art.\n\n**In Popular Culture**\n\nMeade has been featured in several films and books, including the movie \"Gettysburg\" (1993), which stars Tom Berenger as Meade. He has also been the subject of several biographies and histories, including the book \"Meade of Gettysburg\" (1993).\n\n**Dates of Rank**\n\n* Second lieutenant, Topographical Corps (1835)\n* First lieutenant, Topographical Corps (1843)\n* Captain, Topographical Corps (1846)\n* Brigadier general, Army of the Potomac (1862)\n* Major general, Army of the Potomac (1863)\n\n**See also**\n\n* American Civil War\n* Battle of Gettysburg\n* George McClellan\n* Henry Halleck\n* Robert E.

The film is a dark reimagining of the classic Winnie-the-Pooh children's stories, featuring the beloved characters in a gruesome and violent manner.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film takes place in a dark and twisted version of the Hundred Acre Wood, where the characters from the classic stories are now portrayed as violent and bloodthirsty. The story revolves around Christopher Robin, a young boy who has grown up and moved away from the Wood. However, he is now being stalked by the vengeful Winnie-the-Pooh and Piglet, who are determined to exact revenge on him for abandoning them.\n\nAs the story unfolds, it becomes clear that the characters in the Wood are not what they seem. Winnie-the-Pooh is a ravenous and bloodthirsty bear, Piglet is a sadistic and cruel creature, and Eeyore is a hulking and menacing figure. The film's dark and twisted take on the classic characters is both disturbing and fascinating, making for a unique and unsettling viewing experience.\n\n**Cast**\n\nThe film features a talented cast of actors, including:\n\n* Alex Tilling as Christopher Robin\n* Ashley Ormond as Winnie-the-Pooh\n* Christian Haggarty as Piglet\n* James Tarbuck as Eeyore\n* Max Rose as Rabbit\n* Cam Douglas as Tigger\n\nThe cast delivers solid performances, bringing the twisted characters to life in a way that is both eerie and captivating.\n\n**Production**\n\n### Development\n\nThe idea for Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey was born out of a desire to create a unique and unsettling take on the classic Winnie-the-Pooh stories. Rhys Frake-Waterfield, the director, wanted to explore the darker side of the characters and create a film that would challenge audiences' perceptions.\n\n### Filming\n\nFilming took place in a remote location in the UK, with a small crew and a tight budget. The film's budget was reportedly under $1 million, making it a low-budget production. Despite the limited resources, the film's visuals are impressive, with a unique blend of practical and CGI effects.\n\n### Music\n\nThe film's score is a key element in creating the dark and twisted atmosphere. The music is a mix of eerie soundscapes and haunting melodies, perfectly capturing the mood of the film. The score is composed by Rhys Frake-Waterfield and features a range of unsettling sounds and instruments.\n\n**Release**\n\n### Marketing\n\nThe marketing campaign for Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey was low-key, with a focus on social media and online advertising. The film's trailer was released on YouTube and Facebook, generating a buzz among horror fans.\n\n### Home media\n\nWinnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey was released on DVD and Blu-ray in the UK in October 2022. The home media release includes a range of special features, including behind-the-scenes footage and interviews with the cast and crew.\n\n**Reception**\n\n### Box office\n\nWinnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey performed well at the box office, grossing over $10 million worldwide. The film's success was largely due to its unique take on the classic characters and its ability to appeal to both horror fans and fans of the original Winnie-the-Pooh stories.\n\n### Critical response\n\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics, with some praising its unique take on the classic characters and others criticizing its low budget and poor production values. The film holds a 52% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 5.2/10.\n\n### Accolades\n\nWinnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey won several awards, including the Best Horror Film award at the 2022 London Film Festival and the Best Debut Director award at the 2022 British Independent Film Awards.\n\n**Future**\n\n### Sequel\n\nA sequel to Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey is currently in development, with Rhys Frake-Waterfield set to return as director. The sequel is expected to explore new characters and storylines, while maintaining the dark and twisted tone of the original film.\n\n### Shared universe and other projects\n\nThe success of Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey has led to the development of a shared universe, with several other horror films and TV shows in development. The shared universe is expected to feature a range of characters and storylines, all connected by a dark and twisted take on the classic characters.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Winnie-the-Pooh\n* Horror film\n* Dark fantasy\n* Shared universe\n\n**References**\n\n* None\n\n**External links**\n\n* Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey on IMDb\n* Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey on Rotten Tomatoes\n* Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey on Metacritic", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

Born on April 8, 1937, in Chicago, Illinois, Hersh has been a prominent figure in American journalism for over five decades, breaking numerous major stories that have shaped the national conversation.\n\n**Early life and education**\n\nHersh grew up in a working-class family in Chicago's South Side. His father, Isaac Hersh, was a tailor, and his mother, Dora Schwartz, was a homemaker. Hersh developed a strong interest in journalism at an early age, delivering newspapers to support his family during his teenage years. He attended South Shore High School and later enrolled at the University of Chicago, where he studied English and philosophy. After graduating in 1958, Hersh worked as a journalist for several local newspapers, including the _Southtown Economist_ and the _Chicago Daily News_.\n\n**Newspaper career**\n\nHersh's early reporting career was marked by a series of investigative pieces on labor issues and government corruption. In 1964, he joined the _Chicago Sun-Times_ as a reporter, where he covered local politics and government. His reporting on the Chicago Democratic machine and corruption within the city's government administration earned him recognition within the journalism community.\n\n**My Lai massacre**\n\nIn 1969, Hersh was assigned to cover the Vietnam War for the _New York Times_. While reporting on the war, he uncovered a story that would change the course of American history: the My Lai Massacre. On March 16, 1968, American soldiers from Charlie Company of the 1st Battalion, 20th Infantry Regiment, killed hundreds of unarmed Vietnamese civilians in the village of My Lai. Hersh's investigation into the incident, which was initially met with skepticism by the military, revealed the full extent of the atrocities committed by American soldiers. His reporting, which included testimony from soldiers and villagers, led to widespread outrage and calls for accountability.\n\n**The New York Times**\n\nHersh's reporting on the My Lai Massacre marked a turning point in his career, and he became a prominent investigative journalist for the _New York Times_. Over the next several decades, he reported on a range of high-profile stories, including Watergate, the Pentagon Papers, and the Iran-Contra affair. His reporting on these topics earned him numerous awards, including the Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting in 1970.\n\n**Investigative books: 1980s and 1990s**\n\nIn addition to his reporting for the _New York Times_, Hersh wrote several influential books on investigative journalism. _The Price of Power: Kissinger in the Nixon White House_ (1983) examined the Nixon administration's foreign policy and the role of Henry Kissinger in shaping it. _The Dark Side of Camelot_ (1997) explored the presidency of John F. Kennedy and the allegations of a Secret Service agent who claimed that Kennedy had an affair with a woman named Mimi Alford.\n\n**Later investigations**\n\nIn the 2000s and 2010s, Hersh continued to investigate major stories, including the Iraq War and the Abu Ghraib prison abuse scandal. His reporting on the CIA's use of torture and rendition programs revealed widespread human rights abuses and led to calls for accountability within the intelligence community.\n\n**Iraq and Abu Ghraib**\n\nHersh's investigation into the Iraq War began in the early 2000s, when he reported on the use of depleted uranium in the conflict. His reporting on the Abu Ghraib prison abuse scandal, which included testimony from soldiers and civilians, revealed widespread torture and abuse within the prison. His investigation led to calls for accountability within the military and the intelligence community.\n\n**Iran**\n\nIn 2010, Hersh reported on a secret CIA program to sabotage Iran's nuclear program. His investigation revealed that the CIA had been working with Israel to disrupt Iran's nuclear program, but that the program had been unsuccessful.\n\n**Syria and chemical attacks**\n\nIn 2013, Hersh reported on the Syrian government's use of chemical weapons. His investigation revealed that the Syrian government had used sarin gas to attack civilians in the town of Khan al-Assal. His reporting led to calls for accountability within the international community.\n\n**Killing of Osama bin Laden**\n\nHersh reported on the killing of Osama bin Laden in 2011, but his account of the operation differed from the official narrative. He reported that the CIA had been aware of bin Laden's location for several years before the raid, but that the agency had deliberately avoided taking action.\n\n**Nord Stream pipeline and Ukraine**\n\nIn 2020, Hersh reported on the Nord Stream pipeline, which transported natural gas from Russia to Germany. His investigation revealed that the CIA had been working with Ukrainian intelligence to sabotage the pipeline, but that the operation had been unsuccessful.\n\n**Other statements**\n\nIn addition to his investigative reporting, Hersh has made several high-profile statements on various topics. In 2016, he suggested that the murder of Seth Rich, a Democratic National Committee staffer, was linked to the hacking of the party's emails. His statement was widely criticized by the media and the Democratic Party.\n\n**Speeches**\n\nHersh has given several high-profile speeches over the years, including a 2019 address at the New York Public Library, where he spoke on the importance of investigative journalism.\n\n**Murder of Seth Rich**\n\nHersh's statement on the murder of Seth Rich sparked controversy within the media and the Democratic Party. He suggested that Rich's murder was linked to the hacking of the Democratic National Committee's emails, but that the media had covered up the story.\n\n**Pat Nixon abuse**\n\nIn 2019, Hersh reported on allegations of abuse by Pat Nixon, the wife of President Richard Nixon, against a young woman who had been a maid in the White House. His report revealed that Pat Nixon had subjected the woman to physical and emotional abuse.\n\n**Use of anonymous sources**\n\nThroughout his career, Hersh has relied on anonymous sources to gather information for his reporting. His use of anonymous sources has been widely debated within the media and the journalism community.\n\n**Personal life**\n\nHersh has been married twice and has a son and a daughter. He lives in Washington, D.C.\n\n**Awards and honors**\n\nHersh has won numerous awards for his reporting, including the Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting in 1970. He has also been awarded the National Press Club's Fourth Estate Award and the George Polk Award for Investigative Reporting.\n\n**Publications**\n\nHersh has written several books, including _The Price of Power: Kissinger in the Nixon White House_ (1983), _The Dark Side of Camelot_ (1997), and _Chain of Command: The Road from 9/11 to Abu Ghraib_ (2004).\n\n**Books**\n\n* _The Price of Power: Kissinger in the Nixon White House_ (1983)\n* _The Dark Side of Camelot_ (1997)\n* _Chain of Command: The Road from 9/11 to Abu Ghraib_ (2004)\n* _Chain of Command: The Road from 9/11 to Abu Ghraib_ (2004)\n* _The Reporter Who Knew Too Much_ (2018)\n\n**Articles**\n\n* \"My Lai 4: What Really Happened\" (1970)\n* \"The Price of Power\" (1983)\n* \"The Dark Side of Camelot\" (1997)\n* \"The Road from 9/11 to Abu Ghraib\" (2004)\n* \"The CIA's Secret Army in Syria\" (2013)\n\n**References**\n\n* Hersh, S.
