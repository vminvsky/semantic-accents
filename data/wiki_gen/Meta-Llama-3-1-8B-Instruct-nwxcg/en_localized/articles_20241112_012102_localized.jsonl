This collaboration took many forms, including military alliances, economic agreements, and the provision of military personnel, resources, and infrastructure.\n\nTerminology\n\nThe term \"collaboration\" is often used to describe the actions of individuals or groups who worked with the Axis powers, but it can also imply a level of complicity or active support. In some cases, collaboration was a matter of convenience or self-interest, while in others, it was driven by ideological or nationalist motivations.\n\nCollaboration in Western Europe\n\n### Belgium\n\nBelgium was invaded by Germany in May 1940, and the country's government fled to France. A new government, led by the fascist Rex party, was established in Belgium and collaborated with the Germans, providing them with military and economic support. The collaborationist government was led by Léon Degrelle, who became a key figure in the Belgian fascist movement.\n\n### British Channel Islands\n\nThe British Channel Islands, including Jersey and Guernsey, were occupied by Germany from 1940 to 1945. The islands' governments and residents collaborated with the Germans, providing them with food, resources, and labor. Many islanders also served in the German military or worked in German-controlled industries.\n\n### Denmark\n\nDenmark was invaded by Germany in April 1940, and the country's government collaborated with the Germans, providing them with military and economic support. The Danish government-in-exile, led by King Christian X, refused to collaborate with the Germans, but the country's official government, led by Erik Scavenius, worked closely with the Nazis.\n\n### France\n\nThe French government was divided during World War II, with the Vichy government collaborating with the Germans, while the Free French Forces, led by Charles de Gaulle, fought against them. The Vichy government was established in 1940, after the French defeat at the Battle of France, and was led by Marshal Philippe Pétain.\n\n#### Vichy France\n\nVichy France was a collaborationist government established in 1940, after the French defeat at the Battle of France. The government was led by Marshal Philippe Pétain, who became the Chief of State of France. Vichy France collaborated with the Germans, providing them with military and economic support, and participated in the persecution of Jews and other minorities.\n\n#### Collaborationist movements\n\nSeveral collaborationist movements existed in France during World War II, including the French National Revolutionary Movement, the French Popular Party, and the French National Party. These movements supported the Vichy government and worked closely with the Germans.\n\n#### Uniformed collaboration\n\nMany French military personnel collaborated with the Germans, serving in the French army or working as auxiliaries in German-controlled units. Some French military units, such as the French Volunteer Legion, were formed to fight on behalf of the Germans.\n\n#### Communist party\n\nThe French Communist Party was initially opposed to the Vichy government but eventually collaborated with the Germans, providing them with intelligence and support. Many communist leaders, including Maurice Thorez, were arrested and imprisoned by the Germans, but others continued to work with the Nazis.\n\n#### French workers for Germany\n\nMany French workers collaborated with the Germans, working in German-controlled industries or serving in the German military. Some French workers were forced to work in Germany, while others volunteered to serve in the German war effort.\n\n#### Vichy collaboratio", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

The events of summer 1947 captivated the public imagination, with many speculating about the possibility of extraterrestrial life visiting Earth.\n\n**Overview**\n\nThe 1947 flying disc craze was a brief but intense period of UFO sightings and reports that took place in the summer of 1947. The phenomenon began in late June and continued through July and August, with reports coming from various locations across the United States. The craze was marked by a mix of genuine sightings, misidentifications, and hoaxes, which contributed to the public's fascination with the subject.\n\n**Events of Summer 1947**\n\n#### Initial Reports\n\nThe first reported sighting of a flying disc took place on June 24, 1947, when private pilot Kenneth Arnold spotted nine disk-shaped objects flying in formation over Mount Rainier, Washington. Arnold's sighting was widely publicized, and it is often credited with popularizing the term \"flying saucer.\"\n\n#### Additional Reports\n\nIn the days following Arnold's sighting, reports of flying discs began to flood in from across the United States. On June 25, 1947, a group of people in Washington state reported seeing a disc-shaped object streaking across the sky. Similar sightings were reported in Oregon, California, and Idaho.\n\n#### Pacific Northwest Reports Amid Jet Speculation\n\nAs the number of reports grew, speculation began to build about the possibility of military involvement. Some believed that the discs were experimental jet aircraft, while others thought they might be extraterrestrial spacecraft. The Pacific Northwest, where many of the early sightings took place, was particularly affected by the speculation.\n\n#### Reports Throughout the West\n\nBy July 1, 1947, reports of flying discs had spread to other parts of the country. Sightings were reported in the Midwest, the South, and the East Coast, with some reports coming from as far away as New York City and Miami.\n\n#### Potential Explanations Offered\n\nAs the number of reports grew, various explanations were offered to explain the sightings. Some speculated that the discs were experimental aircraft or drones, while others thought they might be natural phenomena, such as meteors or cloud formations.\n\n#### Increasing Prominence\n\nAs the craze continued to build, the sightings gained increasing prominence in the media. On July 2, 1947, the San Francisco Chronicle reported on a massive flying disc sighting in the city, with witnesses claiming to have seen a disc-shaped object hovering above the city.\n\n#### Lt. Governor Sighting Followed by Official Investigation\n\nOn July 3, 1947, the Lt. Governor of California, Goodwin Knight, reported seeing a flying disc while driving on a highway. The sighting sparked an official investigation, with the California Air National Guard launching a search for the disc.\n\n#### San Francisco Fireworks and Stories of Landings\n\nIn San Francisco, the flying disc craze reached a fever pitch. Witnesses reported seeing discs landing in the city, with some even claiming to have seen extraterrestrial beings emerging from the craft.\n\n#### July 4 Press Reports\n\nOn July 4, 1947, the press reported on a massive flying disc sighting in the Midwest, with witnesses claiming to have seen a disc-shaped object hovering above a field.\n\n#### Flight 105\n\nOn July 5, 1947, a commercial airliner, Flight 105, reported seeing a flying disc while flying over the Midwest. The sighting was widely publicized, and it added to the growing list of reported sightings.\n\n#### Group Sightings\n\nAs the number of reports grew, group sightings became more common. On July 6, 1947, a group of people in a small town in the Midwest reported seeing a flying disc, with some even claiming to have seen extraterrestrial beings.\n\n#### Atomic Link Claimed\n\nSome speculated that the flying discs were connected to the atomic bomb, with some claiming that the discs were a new form of nuclear-powered aircraft.\n\n#### Reports Peak\n\nBy mid-July 1947, the reports of flying discs had reached a peak. The media was filled with stories of sightings, and the public was fascinated by the possibility of extraterrestrial life.\n\n#### Weather Balloons, Pranks, and Hoaxes\n\nAs the craze continued, some reports of flying discs were later revealed to be weather balloons, pranks, or hoaxes. On July 15, 1947, a group of people in Hollywood claimed to have recovered a flying disc, but it was later revealed to be a prank.\n\n#### Roswell Debris\n\nOn July 8, 1947, a strange object crashed in Roswell, New Mexico, sparking a wave of speculation about extraterrestrial life. The incident would later become one of the most enduring UFO stories of all time.\n\n#### Reports Diminish\n\nAs the summer of 1947 drew to a close, the reports of flying discs began to diminish. By August 1947, the media attention had shifted to other stories, and the public's fascination with the subject began to wane.\n\n#### Hoaxed Discs Recovered in Hollywood and Detroit\n\nIn the days following the peak of the craze, a number of hoaxed discs were recovered in Hollywood and Detroit.

The day aims to promote women's rights, equality, and empowerment, as well as to recognize the achievements and contributions of women throughout history.\n\n# History\n\n## Origins\n\nThe idea of celebrating Women's Day dates back to the early 20th century. In 1908, 15,000 women marched through New York City to demand better pay, shorter working hours, and voting rights. This event was the precursor to the first National Women's Day in the United States, which was observed on February 28, 1909.\n\n## The Russian Revolution and Communist countries\n\nThe modern concept of International Women's Day, however, originated in Russia. In 1910, the Socialist International conference in Copenhagen designated March 19 as the first International Women's Day to honor the women's suffrage movement. The date was later changed to March 8 to coincide with the 1913 International Women's Conference in Germany.\n\nThe Russian Revolution of 1917 played a significant role in popularizing International Women's Day. On February 23 (March 8 in the Gregorian calendar), thousands of women in Petrograd (now St. Petersburg) protested for \"Bread and Peace,\" marking the beginning of the February Revolution. This event led to the eventual overthrow of the Russian monarchy and the establishment of the world's first socialist government.\n\n## Other countries, 1920s to 1960s\n\nInternational Women's Day quickly gained popularity in other countries, particularly in Europe and Asia. In 1920, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada established their own Women's Days, while in 1922, the Soviet Union made March 8 a national holiday.\n\n## Second–wave feminism\n\nThe second wave of feminism in the 1960s and 1970s saw a resurgence of interest in International Women's Day. Women's rights activists around the world began to organize protests, rallies, and marches to demand equal rights, including reproductive rights, equal pay, and an end to violence against women.\n\n## Adoption by United Nations\n\nIn 1975, the United Nations (UN) officially recognized International Women's Day as an important day to recognize women's rights and empowerment. The UN has since designated an official theme for IWD each year, which is highlighted by its member states.\n\n## Adoption by corporations\n\nIn recent years, many corporations have adopted International Women's Day as an opportunity to promote women's empowerment and equality. Some companies offer paid leave for employees to participate in IWD events, while others provide training and development programs to support women in the workplace.\n\n# International Women's Day by year\n\n## 1995\n\nThe 1995 Beijing World Conference on Women marked a significant milestone in the history of International Women's Day. The conference, attended by representatives from over 180 countries, adopted the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, a comprehensive document outlining strategies for achieving women's rights and empowerment.\n\n## 1996\n\nIn 1996, the UN Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) held its 47th session, focusing on the theme of women and education. The session highlighted the importance of education in promoting women's empowerment and economic development.\n\n## 2003\n\nThe 2003 IWD marked the 20th anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action. The UN Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, called for renewed commitment to implementing the Beijing Platform, which aims to eliminate poverty, violence, and discrimination against women.\n\n## 2006\n\nIn 2006, the UN CSW held its 51st session, focusing on the theme of women and HIV/AIDS.

In the 2019 Conservative Party leadership election, Boris Johnson won the leadership of the party with a promise to deliver Brexit by the end of October 2019. Johnson's victory was seen as a decisive break with the previous leadership of Theresa May, who had struggled to pass a Brexit deal through Parliament.\n\n### 2019 general election\n\nThe 2019 general election was held on 12 December 2019, in which the Conservative Party won a majority of seats in the House of Commons, with Johnson as Prime Minister. The election campaign was dominated by the issue of Brexit, with the Conservative Party running on a platform of \"Get Brexit Done\" and the Labour Party opposing Brexit.\n\n### COVID-19 pandemic and Partygate\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on British politics, with the Conservative Government implementing various measures to slow the spread of the virus, including lockdowns and restrictions on social distancing. However, the Government was also criticized for its handling of the pandemic, particularly in relation to the issue of Partygate, in which it was revealed that senior Government officials had attended parties at 10 Downing Street while the rest of the country was in lockdown.\n\n### June 2022 confidence vote\n\nIn June 2022, Johnson faced a confidence vote among Conservative MPs, which he won with a majority of 211 votes to 148. However, the vote was seen as a close-run thing, and Johnson's leadership was under increasing pressure.\n\n### Government crisis\n\nThe Conservative Government was facing a growing crisis, with several senior ministers resigning in the wake of the Partygate scandal and the economy facing significant challenges. Johnson's leadership was under increasing pressure, and it became clear that he would not be able to continue as Prime Minister for much longer.\n\n**Election details**\n\nThe Conservative Party leadership election was triggered by Johnson's resignation as Prime Minister and Leader of the Conservative Party on 6 July 2022. The election was run by the Conservative Party's 1922 Committee, which is responsible for overseeing leadership elections in the party.\n\nThe election was open to all Conservative MPs, and candidates had to be nominated by at least eight MPs. The election was held in two rounds, with the first round taking place on 5 July 2022 and the second round taking place on 5 September 2022.\n\n**Campaign**\n\nThe campaign for the leadership election was dominated by two candidates, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak. Truss was the former Foreign Secretary and a strong supporter of Brexit, while Sunak was the former Chancellor of the Exchequer and a more moderate voice on Brexit.\n\nTruss ran on a platform of tax cuts and deregulation, while Sunak ran on a platform of fiscal responsibility and economic stability. The two candidates engaged in a series of debates and hustings, during which they clashed on various issues, including Brexit, taxation, and the economy.\n\n**Candidates**\n\n### Nominated\n\nThe following candidates were nominated by at least eight MPs:\n\n* Liz Truss, former Foreign Secretary\n* Rishi Sunak, former Chancellor of the Exchequer\n* Penny Mordaunt, former Leader of the House of Commons\n* Tom Tugendhat, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee\n* Kemi Badenoch, former Equalities Minister\n* Suella Braverman, former Attorney General\n* Grant Shapps, former Transport Secretary\n\n### Withdrew\n\nThe following candidates withdrew from the election:\n\n* Michael Gove, former Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster\n* Sajid Javid, former Health Secretary\n* Jeremy Hunt, former Foreign Secretary\n* Dominic Raab, former Deputy Prime Minister\n\n### Publicly expressed interest\n\nThe following candidates publicly expressed interest in standing, but did not meet the threshold of at least eight nominations:\n\n* Ben Wallace, Secretary of State for Defence\n* Steve Barclay, Chief Secretary to the Treasury\n* Nadhim Zahawi, former Chancellor of the Exchequer\n\n### Declined\n\nThe following candidates declined to stand:\n\n* Jacob Rees-Mogg, former Leader of the House of Commons\n* Priti Patel, former Home Secretary\n\n### Endorsements\n\nSeveral senior Conservative MPs endorsed candidates in the leadership election, including:\n\n* Boris Johnson, former Prime Minister and Leader of the Conservative Party (endorsed Rishi Sunak)\n* Michael Gove, former Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster (endorsed Liz Truss)\n* Sajid Javid, former Health Secretary (endorsed Rishi Sunak)\n* Jeremy Hunt, former Foreign Secretary (endorsed Liz Truss)\n\n**Timeline**\n\nThe following is a timeline of key events in the leadership election:\n\n* 6 July 2022: Boris Johnson resigns as Prime Minister and Leader of the Conservative Party\n* 5 July 2022: First round of the leadership election takes place\n* 14 July 2022: Second round of the leadership election takes place\n* 5 September 2022: First round of the leadership election takes place\n* 14 September 2022: Second round of the leadership election takes place\n\n**Debates**\n\nSeveral debates were held during the leadership election, including:\n\n* 12 July 2022: Debate between Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak on the BBC's Question Time\n* 19 July 2022: Debate between Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak on Sky News\n* 26 July 2022: Debate between Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak on the BBC's Newsnight\n\n**Public reaction**\n\nThe leadership election was widely covered in the media, with many commentators and analysts offering their opinions on the candidates and the election.

It was a complex and multifaceted movement that involved the emergence of new theological ideas, the rise of Protestantism, and the transformation of Western society. The Reformation was a response to the perceived corruption and abuse of power within the Catholic Church, and it ultimately led to the creation of new Christian denominations and the development of modern Western civilization.\n\n#Terminology\n\nThe term \"Reformation\" comes from the Latin word \"reformatio,\" meaning \"renewal\" or \"restoration.\" It was first used by the Protestant reformers to describe their efforts to reform the Catholic Church, but over time, it came to be associated with the broader movement of Protestantism and the transformation of Western society.\n\n#Background\n\n##Calamities\n\nThe Reformation was preceded by a series of calamities that contributed to the growing discontent with the Catholic Church. The Black Death, which ravaged Europe in the 14th century, had a devastating impact on the Church's finances and its ability to provide spiritual guidance to the people. The Hundred Years' War between England and France also had a profound impact on the Church, as it was forced to intervene in the conflict and provide financial and military support to the warring nations.\n\n##Late Medieval Christianity\n\nLate medieval Christianity was characterized by a growing sense of disillusionment with the Church. Many people felt that the Church had become corrupt and that its leaders were more concerned with accumulating wealth and power than with serving the needs of the faithful. This growing discontent was fueled by the rise of humanism, which emphasized the importance of individual reason and the study of classical texts.\n\n###Institutions\n\nThe Catholic Church was a complex institution that included the papacy, the clergy, and the monasteries. The papacy was the highest authority within the Church, and it was responsible for governing the Church and interpreting its teachings. The clergy was responsible for providing spiritual guidance to the people, and it was organized into a hierarchical structure with bishops, priests, and deacons. The monasteries were communities of monks and nuns who devoted themselves to prayer, study, and charitable work.\n\n###Clergy\n\nThe clergy was a powerful institution within the Church, but it was also subject to corruption and abuse of power.

With a rich history spanning over nine decades, the arena has been the site of numerous events, including professional wrestling, boxing, and mixed martial arts matches, concerts, and cultural events.\n\n**History**\n\nThe 2300 Arena was originally built in the 1920s as a freight house. It served as a transportation hub for the city, with trains and ships carrying goods in and out of the facility. Over the years, the building underwent several renovations and expansions to accommodate changing transportation needs.\n\n### 1920–1985: Freight house\n\nDuring its early years, the 2300 Arena was an essential part of Philadelphia's transportation infrastructure. The facility was designed to handle large volumes of cargo, with multiple tracks and loading docks. The building's structure was also equipped with state-of-the-art technology for its time, including cranes and conveyor belts.\n\n### 1986–2002: South Philly Vikings management\n\nIn the late 1980s, the 2300 Arena was converted into a sports venue, with the South Philly Vikings professional wrestling promotion taking over management of the facility. The Vikings, founded by promoter Bill Alfonso, hosted a series of wrestling shows at the arena, featuring local talent and big-name performers.\n\n#### Extreme Championship Wrestling residency, 1993–2001\n\nIn 1993, the 2300 Arena became the primary venue for Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), a popular professional wrestling promotion. ECW's founder, Paul Heyman, had a vision for a more extreme and hard-hitting style of wrestling, which resonated with fans in the Philadelphia area. The arena became a staple for ECW, hosting numerous pay-per-view events, including ECW's flagship show, \"CyberSlam.\"\n\n### 2002–2003: Xtreme Pro Wrestling management\n\nFollowing the demise of ECW, the 2300 Arena was taken over by Xtreme Pro Wrestling (XPW), another professional wrestling promotion. XPW's management, led by promoter Rob Black, hosted a series of shows at the arena, featuring a mix of local and national talent.\n\n### 2004–2012: Roger Artigiani management\n\nIn 2004, Roger Artigiani, a local businessman, took over management of the 2300 Arena. During Artigiani's tenure, the arena underwent significant renovations, including the installation of new seating, sound systems, and stage equipment.\n\n#### Peltz and Hand residency, 2004–2009\n\nIn 2004, the 2300 Arena became the primary venue for Peltz and Hand, a local professional wrestling promotion.

The search was carried out as part of a criminal investigation into the handling and storage of U.S. government records, including classified material.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Handling, Storage, and Disposition of U.S. Government Records\n\nThe handling, storage, and disposition of U.S. government records are governed by various federal laws and regulations. The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) is responsible for managing and preserving federal records, including those related to the presidency. The Presidential Records Act of 1978 requires that all presidential records be preserved and maintained by NARA.\n\n### Criminal Laws Listed on Search Warrant\n\nThe search warrant for Mar-a-Lago listed several federal laws that were allegedly violated, including:\n\n* 18 U.S.C. § 793(e): Gathering, transmitting, or losing defense information\n* 18 U.S.C. § 2071: Concealment, removal, or mutilation generally\n* 18 U.S.C. § 1519: Destruction, alteration, or falsification of records in federal investigations and bankruptcy\n\n### Classified Material and the Presidency\n\nThe presidency is entrusted with the authority to classify national security information. The president has the power to classify information and declassify it at will. However, the declassification process is governed by regulations and requires the consultation of other government agencies.\n\n#### Declassification, Presidential Powers and Regulations\n\nThe president has the power to declassify classified material, but this power is not absolute. The president must follow established procedures and consult with other government agencies before declassifying sensitive information. The president may also delegate this authority to other officials.\n\n#### Protocols for Loss or Compromise of Classified Material\n\nThe loss or compromise of classified material is a serious offense and can have severe consequences. The government has established protocols to prevent the loss or compromise of classified material, including the use of classified information and the handling of classified documents.\n\n**Events Leading to the Search**\n\n### NARA Actions to Retrieve Presidential Records from Mar-a-Lago\n\nIn 2021, NARA issued a letter to Trump and his representatives requesting the return of presidential records from Mar-a-Lago. The letter stated that the records were required to be preserved and maintained by NARA.\n\n### Partial Return of Records to NARA\n\nIn July 2021, Trump's representatives returned some presidential records to NARA. However, the agency stated that the return was incomplete and that additional records were still missing.\n\n### Trump's Statement Regarding Return of Records\n\nTrump claimed that he had returned all the records requested by NARA and that he had been cooperative throughout the process.\n\n### NARA Makes Criminal Referral\n\nIn May 2022, NARA made a criminal referral to the Department of Justice (DOJ) regarding the handling of presidential records by Trump and his representatives.\n\n### Tom Fitton's Advice to Trump\n\nTom Fitton, the president of Judicial Watch, advised Trump to return all the records requested by NARA and to cooperate fully with the investigation.\n\n## FBI/DOJ Launches Criminal Investigation and Issues Subpoenas\n\nIn May 2022, the FBI and DOJ launched a criminal investigation into the handling and storage of U.S. government records by Trump and his representatives. The investigation was prompted by the NARA referral and the failure of Trump's representatives to return all the requested records.\n\n### May 2022 Subpoena\n\nIn May 2022, the FBI and DOJ issued a subpoena to Trump's representatives, requesting that they produce all the presidential records in their possession.\n\n### June 2022 Subpoena\n\nIn June 2022, the FBI and DOJ issued a second subpoena to Trump's representatives, requesting that they produce additional records and provide information about the handling and storage of presidential records.\n\n## FBI/DOJ Obtains Search Warrant from Federal Court\n\nOn August 5, 2022, the FBI and DOJ obtained a search warrant from a federal court, authorizing them to search Mar-a-Lago and seize any evidence related to the investigation.\n\n**Search of Mar-a-Lago**\n\nThe search of Mar-a-Lago was conducted on August 8, 2022, by the FBI and other law enforcement agencies. The search was carried out in the presence of Trump's representatives and was videotaped by the FBI.\n\n## Search of Other Trump Properties\n\nThe search warrant also authorized the FBI to search other Trump properties, including his estate in Bedminster, New Jersey.\n\n**Release of Search Warrant, Property Receipt, and Affidavit**\n\nOn August 11, 2022, the FBI released the search warrant, property receipt, and affidavit related to the search of Mar-a-Lago.\n\n### Seized Materials\n\nThe search warrant and property receipt listed several items that were seized during the search, including:\n\n* Documents with classification markings\n* Empty folders with classified banners\n* Documents with handwritten notes\n* Electronic devices\n\n### Missing Materials\n\nThe search warrant and property receipt also listed several items that were missing or couldn't be found during the search, including:\n\n* A phone\n* A safe\n* A lockbox\n\n## Motions to Release Search Warrant Affidavit\n\nOn August 12, 2022, Trump's lawyers filed a motion to release the search warrant affidavit, arguing that the affidavit was necessary to understand the basis of the search.\n\n## Release of Redacted Search Warrant Affidavit\n\nOn August 25, 2022, the DOJ released a redacted version of the search warrant affidavit, which provided some details about the investigation and the basis for the search.\n\n## Release of Detailed Property List\n\nOn September 2, 2022, the DOJ released a detailed property list related to the search of Mar-a-Lago, which provided more information about the items seized and the items missing or couldn't be found.\n\n**Trump v. United States**\n\nOn August 12, 2022, Trump's lawyers filed a lawsuit against the United States, arguing that the search of Mar-a-Lago was unconstitutional and that the search warrant was invalid.\n\n**Special Counsel Investigation**\n\nThe search of Mar-a-Lago was part of a larger investigation into the handling and storage of U.S. government records by Trump and his representatives. The investigation was led by a special counsel and involved several law enforcement agencies.\n\n## Indictment\n\nOn June 8, 2023, a grand jury indicted Trump on several charges related to the handling and storage of U.S. government records, including conspiracy, obstruction of justice, and mishandling of classified documents.\n\n**Reactions**\n\n### Congress\n\nThe search of Mar-a-Lago was widely condemned by Democrats and Republicans in Congress, who argued that the search was a grave abuse of power and a witch hunt.\n\n### White House\n\nThe White House declined to comment on the search of Mar-a-Lago, citing the ongoing investigation.\n\n### National Archives\n\nThe National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) welcomed the search of Mar-a-Lago, stating that the agency had been seeking to retrieve presidential records for years.\n\n### Trump, His Family, and His Attorneys\n\nTrump and his representatives denied any wrongdoing and claimed that the search was a partisan witch hunt. Trump's lawyers argued that the search was unconstitutional and that the search warrant was invalid.\n\n### Claims of Political Motivation, Planted Evidence, and Obama Precedent\n\nTrump and his representatives claimed that the search was motivated by politics and that evidence was planted to frame Trump. They also cited the example of former President Barack Obama, who allegedly mishandled classified documents, to suggest that Trump was being unfairly targeted.\n\n### Claims of Declassifying All Documents\n\nTrump claimed that he had declassified all the documents in question and that the search was unnecessary.\n\n### Lawsuit\n\nTrump's lawsuit against the United States argued that the search was unconstitutional and that the search warrant was invalid.\n\n### Trump Allies and Supporters\n\nTrump's supporters and allies praised the former president, calling the search a witch hunt and a grave abuse of power.\n\n### Threats Against Government Officials\n\nSome Trump supporters made threats against government officials, including federal investigators and prosecutors.\n\n### FBI Field Office Attack\n\nOn June 8, 2023, a gunman attacked an FBI field office in Cincinnati, Ohio, killing one agent and injuring another. The gunman was reportedly a Trump supporter.\n\n### Republican Elected Officials and Candidates\n\nSome Republican elected officials and candidates praised Trump, calling the search a witch hunt and a grave abuse of power.\n\n### Congressional Democrats\n\nCongressional Democrats condemned the search, arguing that it was a grave abuse of power and a witch hunt.\n\n### Scholars and Former Officials\n\nSome scholars and former officials argued that the search was a necessary step in ensuring the integrity of the presidency and the rule of law.\n\n### Intelligence Community\n\nThe intelligence community welcomed the search of Mar-a-Lago, stating that the agency had been seeking to retrieve classified documents for years.\n\n### Former Trump Administration Figures\n\nSome former Trump administration officials praised Trump, calling the search a witch hunt and a grave abuse of power.\n\n**Notes**\n\nThis article is intended to provide a factual summary of the events surrounding the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago.

The fort played a significant role in the history of New York City, serving as a key location in the colonial era and beyond. This article will provide an overview of the history of Fort Amsterdam, from its establishment to its eventual decline.\n\n### Introduction\n\nFort Amsterdam was built by the Dutch in 1624 as a fortified trading post and military outpost. The fort was strategically located at the southern tip of Manhattan Island, providing access to the Hudson River and the Atlantic Ocean. Over the years, the fort changed hands several times, serving under various colonial powers, including the Dutch, English, and British. This article will explore the history of Fort Amsterdam, highlighting its significance in the development of New York City.\n\n### Establishment (1621–1660)\n\nThe Dutch West India Company established Fort Amsterdam in 1624 as a fortified trading post and military outpost. The fort was built on the southern tip of Manhattan Island, which was then a Dutch colony known as New Netherland. The fort's primary purpose was to provide a secure location for the Dutch to trade with the indigenous peoples of the region and to protect their interests from rival European powers. The fort was designed by Dutch engineer Adriaen van der Donck, who later became a prominent figure in the colony.\n\nDuring the early years of its establishment, Fort Amsterdam faced several challenges, including conflicts with the indigenous peoples and rival European powers. In 1626, the Dutch West India Company established the colony of New Amsterdam, which would eventually become the city of New York. The fort played a key role in the development of the colony, serving as a hub for trade and commerce.\n\n### English rule (1664–1673)\n\nIn 1664, the English took control of New Amsterdam from the Dutch, renaming it New York. Fort Amsterdam was renamed Fort James, and the English made several modifications to the fort to better suit their needs. The English used the fort as a military outpost and a place of imprisonment for those who opposed their rule. During this period, the fort also served as a hub for trade and commerce, with the English establishing several businesses and trading posts in the area.\n\n### Dutch rule (1673–1674)\n\nIn 1673, the Dutch regained control of New York from the English, and Fort James was renamed Fort Amsterdam once again. The Dutch made several modifications to the fort, including the addition of new walls and a new gatehouse. However, their rule was short-lived, as the English regained control of the colony in 1674.\n\n### English rule (1674–1689)\n\nAfter regaining control of New York, the English restored the fort to its original name, Fort James. During this period, the fort continued to serve as a military outpost and a place of imprisonment for those who opposed the English rule. In 1686, the English established a new government in New York, with a governor and a council. The fort played a key role in the development of this new government, serving as a symbol of English power and authority.\n\n### Colonist rule (1689–1691)\n\nIn 1689, a group of colonists, including many former Dutch residents of New York, rose up against the English government and established a new government in the colony. The colonists, who were known as the New Yorkers, established a new parliament and a new government, with a governor and a council. Fort Amsterdam played a key role in this new government, serving as a symbol of the colonists' resistance against English rule. However, their rule was short-lived, as the English regained control of the colony in 1691.\n\n### British rule (1691–1775)\n\nAfter regaining control of New York, the English restored the fort to its original name, Fort James. During this period, the fort continued to serve as a military outpost and a place of imprisonment for those who opposed the English rule. In 1701, the British government established a new government in New York, with a governor and a council. The fort played a key role in the development of this new government, serving as a symbol of British power and authority.\n\n### Prelude to the revolution\n\nIn the years leading up to the American Revolution, tensions between the British government and the colonists in New York began to rise. The colonists, who were predominantly of Dutch and English descent, were increasingly frustrated with the British government's policies, which they saw as oppressive and burdensome. In 1774, the British government passed a series of laws known as the Coercive Acts, which aimed to punish the colonists for their resistance. The colonists, who were determined to resist British rule, responded with a series of protests and demonstrations, including the Boston Tea Party.\n\n### Colonist rule (1775–1776)\n\nIn 1775, the colonists in New York rose up against the British government and established a new government in the colony. The colonists, who were known as the New Yorkers, established a new parliament and a new government, with a governor and a council. Fort Amsterdam played a key role in this new government, serving as a symbol of the colonists' resistance against British rule. However, their rule was short-lived, as the British regained control of the colony in 1776.\n\n### British rule (1776–1783)\n\nAfter regaining control of New York, the British restored the fort to its original name, Fort James. During this period, the fort continued to serve as a military outpost and a place of imprisonment for those who opposed the British rule. In 1781, the British government established a new government in New York, with a governor and a council. The fort played a key role in the development of this new government, serving as a symbol of British power and authority.\n\n### American rule (1783–1790)\n\nAfter the American Revolution, the United States government took control of New York from the British. Fort Amsterdam was renamed Fort Clinton, and the American government made several modifications to the fort to better suit their needs. The fort continued to serve as a military outpost and a place of imprisonment for those who opposed the American rule. In 1790, the American government established a new government in New York, with a governor and a council. The fort played a key role in the development of this new government, serving as a symbol of American power and authority.\n\n### See also\n\n* Fort James (New York)\n* New Amsterdam\n* New York City\n* New York State\n* American Revolution\n* British Empire\n* Dutch West India Company\n\n### Notes\n\n* The history of Fort Amsterdam is complex and multifaceted, reflecting the diverse cultural and political influences that have shaped the region over time.\n* The fort has played a significant role in the development of New York City, serving as a military outpost, a place of imprisonment, and a symbol of power and authority.\n* The fort's name has changed several times over the years, reflecting the different colonial powers that have controlled the region.\n\n### Bibliography\n\n* \"A History of New York City\" by Edmund Morris\n* \"New York City: A Cultural History\" by Dell Upton\n* \"The Dutch in America\" by Russell Menard\n* \"The British in America\" by Stephen Innes\n* \"The American Revolution\" by Gordon S.

The election was the fifth national election in four years, following a complex and contentious political landscape in the country.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe election was called after Prime Minister Naftali Bennett of the Yamina party resigned in June 2022, and the Knesset failed to pass a budget. The resignation marked the end of the Bennett-Lapid government, which had been in power since June 2021. The election was expected to be a highly contested and unpredictable event, with several parties and factions vying for power.\n\n**Campaign**\n\nThe campaign for the 2022 Israeli legislative election was marked by intense competition and polarization. The main parties, including Likud, Blue and White, and the United Arab List, ran on platforms of social and economic issues, as well as security and foreign policy. The campaign was also notable for the rise of new and fringe parties, including the Religious Zionist party and the New Hope party.\n\n**Timeline**\n\nThe timeline of the 2022 Israeli legislative election was as follows:\n\n* June 2022: Prime Minister Naftali Bennett resigns, and the Knesset fails to pass a budget.\n* July 2022: The Knesset dissolves, and the election is called.\n* August 2022: The Central Elections Committee announces the final list of parties and candidates.\n* September 2022: The campaign begins, with parties launching their election campaigns.\n* October 2022: The debate season begins, with leaders of the main parties participating in televised debates.\n* November 1, 2022: The election is held.\n\n**Electoral system**\n\nThe electoral system in Israel is based on proportional representation, with 120 seats in the Knesset allocated among parties according to the number of votes they receive. The system is designed to ensure that parties receive a proportionate number of seats based on the number of votes they receive.\n\n**Surplus-vote agreements**\n\nIn Israel, parties can form surplus-vote agreements with other parties, which allows them to transfer excess votes to another party in exchange for a guarantee of a certain number of seats. This system is designed to prevent small parties from being left without representation in the Knesset.\n\n**Political parties**\n\n### Factions before the election\n\nBefore the election, several factions emerged within the main parties, including:\n\n* Likud: The Likud party was divided between two main factions, the \"Likud old guard\" and the \"Likud new guard.\"\n* Blue and White: The Blue and White party was divided between the \"Blue and White old guard\" and the \"Blue and White new guard.\"\n* United Arab List: The United Arab List was divided between the \"United Arab List old guard\" and the \"United Arab List new guard.\"\n\n### Retiring incumbents\n\nSeveral incumbent members of the Knesset retired before the election, including:\n\n* Benny Begin (Likud)\n* Yair Lapid (Blue and White)\n* Merav Michaeli (Blue and White)\n* Ayelet Shaked (Yamina)\n* Eli Yishai (Shas)\n\n### Contesting parties\n\nSeveral parties contested the election, including:\n\n* Likud\n* Blue and White\n* United Arab List\n* Yamina\n* Shas\n* Religious Zionist\n* New Hope\n* Meretz\n* Hadash\n* Ta'al\n\n### Not running\n\nSeveral parties and figures decided not to run in the election, including:\n\n* Avigdor Lieberman (after a merger with Yisrael Beiteinu)\n* Zehava Gal-On (after a merger with Meretz)\n* Dov Khenin (after a merger with Hadash)\n\n**Leadership elections and primaries**\n\nSeveral parties held leadership elections and primaries before the election, including:\n\n* **Balad**: Balad held a leadership election in August 2022, which was won by Ahmed Tibi.\n* **Hadash**: Hadash held a leadership election in September 2022, which was won by Ofer Cassif.\n* **Labor**: Labor held a leadership election in October 2022, which was won by Merav Michaeli.\n* **Likud**: Likud held a leadership election in August 2022, which was won by Benjamin Netanyahu.\n* **Meretz**: Meretz held a leadership election in September 2022, which was won by Zehava Gal-On.\n* **Religious Zionist**: Religious Zionist held a leadership election in August 2022, which was won by Itamar Ben-Gvir.\n* **Ta'al**: Ta'al held a leadership election in September 2022, which was won by Ahmad Tibi.\n* **United Arab List**: United Arab List held a leadership election in August 2022, which was won by Mansour Abbas.\n\n**Opinion polls**\n\nOpinion polls before the election showed a highly competitive and unpredictable landscape, with several parties and factions vying for power.

The debates were marked by intense competition and polarization, with several leaders engaging in heated exchanges.\n\n**Results**\n\nThe election was held on November 1, 2022, and the results were as follows:\n\n* Likud: 32 seats\n* Blue and White: 25 seats\n* United Arab List: 15 seats\n* Yamina: 10 seats\n* Shas: 9 seats\n* Religious Zionist: 6 seats\n* New Hope: 5 seats\n* Meretz: 4 seats\n* Hadash: 3 seats\n* Ta'al: 2 seats\n\n**Members of the Knesset who lost their seats**\n\nSeveral members of the Knesset lost their seats in the election, including:\n\n* Benny Begin (Likud)\n* Yair Lapid (Blue and White)\n* Merav Michaeli (Blue and White)\n* Ayelet Shaked (Yamina)\n* Eli Yishai (Shas)\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe election marked the end of the Bennett-Lapid government, and the beginning of a new era in Israeli politics. The results showed a highly fragmented and unstable landscape, with several parties and factions vying for power.\n\n**Government formation**\n\nThe government formation process began in November 2022, with Benjamin Netanyahu emerging as the leader of the Likud party.

The earthquake was a significant event that caused widespread damage and loss of life in the region.\n\n# Earthquake\n\n## Tectonic setting\nThe tectonic setting of Afghanistan is characterized by the presence of several major fault lines, including the Hindu Kush Himalayan orogeny, which is a result of the collision between the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates. This process has led to the formation of a complex and dynamic geology, with numerous faults, folds, and fractures. The region is also prone to earthquakes due to the tectonic activity and the presence of several major fault lines.\n\n## Characteristics\nThe earthquake that occurred on June 22, 2022, was a 6.2 magnitude earthquake, according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The epicenter of the earthquake was located in the Paktika province, near the city of Gayan. The earthquake was a shallow event, with a depth of approximately 10 kilometers, which contributed to the significant damage and loss of life.\n\n## Intensity\nThe intensity of the earthquake was felt in several provinces, including Paktika, Khost, and Kandahar. The earthquake caused widespread destruction, including the collapse of homes, schools, and other infrastructure. The intensity of the earthquake was reported to be at least VIII (Severe) on the Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale.\n\n## Aftershocks\nFollowing the main earthquake, several aftershocks were reported in the region. The aftershocks were smaller in magnitude, ranging from 4.5 to 5.5 magnitude, but still caused significant damage and disruption in the affected areas.\n\n# Impact\n\n## Afghanistan\nThe impact of the earthquake was severe in Afghanistan, with widespread damage and loss of life reported in several provinces. The earthquake affected over 10,000 families, with many left homeless or without access to basic necessities. The death toll from the earthquake was reported to be at least 1,000, with many more injured.\n\n## Pakistan\nThe earthquake was also felt in Pakistan, with reports of damage and disruption in several provinces. The earthquake caused power outages and damage to infrastructure, including roads and bridges. The impact of the earthquake was significant, but the death toll was lower than in Afghanistan.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe aftermath of the earthquake was characterized by a massive relief effort, with aid pouring in from both within Afghanistan and from international organizations. The relief effort was led by the government of Afghanistan, with support from the international community.\n\n# Domestic response\n\nThe domestic response to the earthquake was significant, with the government of Afghanistan mobilizing resources to respond to the disaster. The government established a national emergency response committee to coordinate the relief efforts, with support from international organizations and aid agencies.\n\n# International response\n\nThe international response to the earthquake was immediate and significant, with aid pouring in from several countries and international organizations. The United States, European Union, and several other countries provided significant aid, including financial support, medical supplies, and humanitarian assistance.\n\n## United States\nThe United States was one of the first countries to respond to the earthquake, with the US Agency for International Development (USAID) providing significant aid. The US government provided $50 million in emergency funding to support the relief efforts, with additional aid provided through non-governmental organizations (NGOs).\n\n## International organizations\nSeveral international organizations, including the United Nations, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), and the International Rescue Committee (IRC), provided significant aid to support the relief efforts. The organizations provided humanitarian assistance, including food, shelter, and medical supplies, to affected communities.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of earthquakes in Afghanistan\n* List of earthquakes in Pakistan\n* List of natural disasters by death toll\n\n# References\n\nThis article does not reference any external sources.\n\n# Further reading\n\n* \"Afghanistan earthquake: Death toll rises to 1,000\" (Al Jazeera)\n* \"Afghanistan earthquake: US provides $50 million in aid\" (BBC News)\n* \"Afghanistan earthquake: International aid pours in\" (The New York Times)\n\n# External links\n\n* United States Geological Survey (USGS): Afghanistan earthquake\n* International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC): Afghanistan earthquake\n* International Rescue Committee (IRC): Afghanistan earthquake", "prompt": "You are an active Wikipedia contributor from the USA.

Union of India**\n\n**Case Summary**\n\nSupriyo v. Union of India is a landmark case in Indian law that deals with the issue of same-sex marriage and the rights of LGBTQ+ individuals. The case was filed in 2018 by a group of individuals, including Supriyo, who sought to challenge the constitutional validity of section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, which criminalizes consensual same-sex relationships. The case has been a subject of intense debate and has sparked discussions on the rights of LGBTQ+ individuals in India.\n\n**Intervenors**\n\n### Government\n\nThe Government of India was represented by the Attorney General of India, who argued that section 377 was a constitutional provision that protected the social and moral values of the country.

The Indian Penal Code, which was enacted in 1860, criminalized consensual same-sex relationships, making it a punishable offense. The provision was used to harass and intimidate LGBTQ+ individuals, leading to widespread human rights abuses.

The show features a unique format where contestants compete against each other by showcasing their singing talents, and a team of coaches guides them through the competition. The show has been a huge success in the United States, and its 23rd season was a highly anticipated event.\n\n**Development**\n\nThe 23rd season of The Voice was announced by NBC in August 2022, with a premiere date set for March 6, 2023.

The team's first international match was played against Switzerland on June 17, 1940, in Zürich, which ended in a 2-1 loss.\n\n## Blažević period (1994–1999)\n\nFollowing the dissolution of Yugoslavia, the Croatian Football Federation was re-established in 1992. The national team was rebuilt under the guidance of coach Miroslav Blažević, who led the team to their first major international tournament, the 1996 UEFA European Championship. Although they were eliminated in the group stage, the team showed promise and set the stage for future success.\n\n## Jozić, Barić and Kranjčar period (2000–2006)\n\nIn 2000, coach Mirko Jozić took over the team, and Croatia qualified for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, where they were eliminated in the group stage. Under Jozić's successor, Kranjčar, the team experienced a decline in performance, but still managed to qualify for the 2004 UEFA European Championship.\n\n## Bilić period (2006–2012)\n\nSlaven Bilić took over as coach in 2006 and led the team to their first World Cup semifinal in 2018, where they were defeated by France. Croatia also finished as runners-up in the 2012 UEFA European Championship, losing to Spain in the final.\n\n## Štimac, Kovač and Čačić period (2012–2017)\n\nFollowing Bilić's departure, the team was led by coaches Slaven Bilić, Ante Čačić, and Ante Miličić, but failed to replicate their previous success.\n\n## Dalić period (since 2017)\n\nZlatko Dalić took over as coach in 2017 and led the team to the World Cup semifinal in 2018, where they were defeated by England. Croatia also finished as runners-up in the 2018 UEFA Nations League, losing to France in the final.\n\n# Image\n\n## Kits\n\nThe Croatia national team's home kit is a red shirt with white shorts and red socks, while their away kit is a white shirt with a blue stripe and white shorts and blue socks.\n\n## Supporters\n\nCroatian fans are known for their passion and dedication to the team. They have a strong following in Croatia, as well as a significant presence in other countries.\n\n## Charity\n\nThe Croatian Football Federation has partnered with various charities to promote football development and social causes in Croatia.\n\n# Stadiums\n\nThe Croatia national team plays their home matches at the Poljud Stadium in Split, which has a capacity of 35,000. They also use the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb, which has a capacity of 21,000.\n\n# Results and fixtures\n\n## 2023\n\nCroatia's 2023 fixture list is as follows:\n\n* June 14, 2023: Croatia vs. Denmark (2024 UEFA European Championship)\n* June 18, 2023: Croatia vs. Austria (2024 UEFA European Championship)\n* June 22, 2023: Croatia vs. Czech Republic (2024 UEFA European Championship)\n\n## 2024\n\nCroatia's 2024 fixture list is as follows:\n\n* March 21, 2024: Croatia vs. Turkey (2024 UEFA European Championship)\n* March 26, 2024: Croatia vs. Greece (2024 UEFA European Championship)\n\n# Management\n\n## Manager history\n\n1.
