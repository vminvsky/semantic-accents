The crisis began with the liquidation of Silvergate Bank in March 2023, followed by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) in March, Signature Bank in March, and First Republic Bank in May. The crisis led to a significant loss of trust in the banking system, a decline in economic confidence, and a re-evaluation of the regulatory environment.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe banking industry in the United States has experienced significant changes in recent years, including the rise of digital banking, increased competition, and evolving regulatory requirements. The COVID-19 pandemic also had a profound impact on the banking sector, leading to increased demand for credit and a rise in asset prices. However, the pandemic also led to a decline in economic activity, which had a negative impact on the banking sector.\n\n**Liquidation of Silvergate Bank**\n\n### Background\n\nSilvergate Bank was a commercial bank headquartered in La Jolla, California. The bank was founded in 2018 and focused on serving the needs of digital asset companies and other non-traditional financial institutions. Silvergate Bank was known for its innovative approach to banking, including the use of blockchain technology and other digital platforms.\n\n### Events\n\nIn March 2023, Silvergate Bank announced that it would be liquidating its assets and ceasing operations. The bank cited a combination of factors, including a decline in asset values, increased regulatory scrutiny, and a loss of confidence among its customers. The liquidation of Silvergate Bank marked the beginning of the 2023 banking crisis and led to a significant decline in confidence among investors and regulators.\n\nThe collapse of Silvergate Bank also had a significant impact on the digital asset market, as many companies that had relied on the bank for banking services were left without access to their funds. This led to a decline in the value of digital assets, including cryptocurrencies and other digital tokens.\n\n**Collapse of Silicon Valley Bank**\n\n### Background\n\nSilicon Valley Bank (SVB) was a commercial bank headquartered in Santa Clara, California.

The film is produced by Vijay Kiragandur under the banner Hombale Films. Kantara is set in the coastal town of Shivamogga and revolves around the themes of land ownership, tradition, and the struggles of farmers. The film received widespread critical acclaim and became a commercial success, leading to the creation of a prequel and sparking controversies surrounding land ownership and cultural traditions.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe story of Kantara is set in the present day, but also explores the past of the protagonist, Shiva, a local farmer who lives in the coastal town of Shivamogga. Shiva is a devoted son of the soil and a traditionalist who adheres to the customs and rituals of his community. He is deeply concerned about the encroachment of outsiders on the land of his ancestors and the degradation of the environment. The film's narrative is a complex blend of action, drama, and fantasy, with Shiva's journey taking him through various stages of self-discovery and transformation.\n\nAs the story unfolds, Shiva's relationship with his sister, Varsha, is revealed, and the audience is introduced to a subplot involving the police and a land mafia. The film's climax features an epic battle between Shiva and the land mafia, which is both visually stunning and emotionally resonant. Throughout the film, the director uses the character of Shiva to explore themes of land ownership, tradition, and the struggles of farmers, raising important questions about the impact of modernization and globalization on rural communities.\n\n**Cast**\n\nThe film features a talented cast, including:\n\n* Rishab Shetty as Shiva, the protagonist\n* Sapthami Gowda as Varsha, Shiva's sister\n* Kishore Kumar G as Deva, a local artist\n* Achyuth Kumar as Police Inspector, a corrupt police officer\n* Pramod Shetty as Ramesh, a land mafia leader\n\n**Production**\n\n### Development\n\nThe idea for Kantara was conceived by Rishab Shetty, who wrote the screenplay and directed the film. Shetty is a well-known actor and director in Kannada cinema, known for his powerful performances and innovative storytelling. He drew inspiration for the film from his own experiences growing up in a rural community and his concerns about the impact of modernization on traditional ways of life.\n\nShetty worked closely with the producer, Vijay Kiragandur, to develop the script and secure funding for the film. The production team spent several months researching and preparing for the shoot, including scouting locations and casting actors.\n\n### Filming\n\nPrincipal photography for Kantara began in August 2021 and took several months to complete. The film was shot on location in Shivamogga and surrounding areas, with a team of over 100 crew members and 500 extras.

The mission aims to demonstrate a soft landing on the Moon's south pole and conduct scientific experiments on the lunar surface.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe Chandrayaan-3 mission is the third lunar mission developed by ISRO, following the Chandrayaan-1 and Chandrayaan-2 missions. The mission was launched on July 14, 2023, aboard the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark III (GSLV Mk III) rocket. The mission is designed to achieve a soft landing on the Moon's south pole and conduct scientific experiments to study the lunar surface and subsurface.\n\n**History**\n\nThe Chandrayaan-3 mission was first announced in 2020, with ISRO planning to launch the mission in 2021. However, due to delays and technical issues, the launch was rescheduled for 2023. The mission is a significant improvement over the Chandrayaan-2 mission, which failed to achieve a soft landing on the Moon's south pole due to a premature descent sequence.\n\n**Objectives**\n\nThe primary objectives of the Chandrayaan-3 mission are:\n\n1. To demonstrate a soft landing on the Moon's south pole\n2. To conduct scientific experiments on the lunar surface and subsurface\n3. To study the lunar regolith and its composition\n4. To study the lunar exosphere and its interaction with the solar wind\n5. To demonstrate the capability of the Vikram lander and the Pragyan rover\n\n**Spacecraft**\n\nThe Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft consists of three main components:\n\n### **Design**\n\nThe Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft is designed to be a modular spacecraft, consisting of a propulsion module, a Vikram lander, and a Pragyan rover. The propulsion module is responsible for carrying the spacecraft to the Moon, while the Vikram lander is responsible for descending to the lunar surface. The Pragyan rover is responsible for conducting scientific experiments on the lunar surface.\n\n### **Propulsion module**\n\nThe propulsion module is the main engine of the Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft. It is powered by a liquid-fueled engine and is capable of carrying the spacecraft to the Moon. The propulsion module is also equipped with a computer system and a communication system.\n\n### **Vikram lander**\n\nThe Vikram lander is a critical component of the Chandrayaan-3 mission. It is designed to descend to the lunar surface, carrying the Pragyan rover and scientific instruments. The Vikram lander is equipped with a computer system, a communication system, and a propulsion system.\n\n### **Rover Pragyan**\n\nThe Pragyan rover is a robotic vehicle that is designed to conduct scientific experiments on the lunar surface. It is equipped with a computer system, a communication system, and a propulsion system. The Pragyan rover is designed to operate on the lunar surface for a period of 14 days.\n\n## **Payloads**\n\nThe Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft carries a number of scientific payloads, including:\n\n### **On lander**\n\nThe Vikram lander carries the following scientific payloads:\n\n* A seismometer to measure moonquakes\n* A laser altimeter to measure the lunar topography\n* A lunar surface acoustic sensor to measure the lunar regolith\n\n### **On rover**\n\nThe Pragyan rover carries the following scientific payloads:\n\n* A gamma-ray spectrometer to measure the lunar regolith composition\n* A lunar surface composition instrument to measure the lunar surface composition\n* A lunar surface temperature sensor to measure the lunar surface temperature\n\n### **On the propulsion module**\n\nThe propulsion module carries the following scientific payloads:\n\n* A plasma spectrometer to measure the lunar exosphere composition\n* A solar wind monitor to measure the solar wind interaction with the lunar exosphere\n\n**Mission profile**\n\nThe Chandrayaan-3 mission follows a complex trajectory, which includes the following phases:\n\n## **Launch**\n\nThe Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft was launched on July 14, 2023, aboard the GSLV Mk III rocket from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre.\n\n## **Orbit**\n\nAfter launch, the Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft entered into a highly elliptical orbit around the Earth.\n\n## **Landing**\n\nThe Vikram lander separated from the propulsion module and entered into a lunar transfer orbit. The Vikram lander then descended to the lunar surface, using a combination of computer-controlled descent sequence and a precision lander system.\n\n## **Surface operations**\n\nAfter landing, the Pragyan rover deployed from the Vikram lander and began conducting scientific experiments on the lunar surface.\n\n## **Propulsion module reinserted to orbit around Earth**\n\nAfter completing its mission, the propulsion module was reinserted into an orbit around the Earth, where it will remain for a period of several years.\n\n## **Mission life**\n\nThe Chandrayaan-3 mission is designed to operate for a period of 14 days, during which the Pragyan rover will conduct scientific experiments on the lunar surface.\n\n**Team**\n\nThe Chandrayaan-3 mission is a collaboration between ISRO and several Indian universities and research institutions. The mission team includes scientists, engineers, and technicians from various fields, including planetary science, materials science, and computer science.\n\n**Funding**\n\nThe Chandrayaan-3 mission is funded by the Indian government, with a budget of approximately ₹1,000 crores (approximately $140 million USD).\n\n**Results**\n\nThe Chandrayaan-3 mission has achieved several significant results, including:\n\n## **Temperature variation**\n\nThe Pragyan rover has measured the lunar surface temperature, which varies between -173°C and 127°C.\n\n## **Detection of sulfur**\n\nThe gamma-ray spectrometer on the Pragyan rover has detected sulfur in the lunar regolith.\n\n## **Plasma measurement**\n\nThe plasma spectrometer on the propulsion module has measured the lunar exosphere composition.\n\n## **Seismic measurements**\n\nThe seismometer on the Vikram lander has measured moonquakes on the lunar surface.\n\n**Domestic reactions**\n\nThe Chandrayaan-3 mission has received widespread attention in India, with many Indians congratulating ISRO on its success.

The opera premiered in 1913 and has since been largely forgotten, but in recent years, it has undergone a posthumous revival, sparking new interest in Sibelius's work.\n\n**History**\n\n### Composition\n\nThe idea of an opera based on the Finnish national epic, the Kalevala, had been floating around in Sibelius's mind for years. In 1910, he received a libretto from Väinö Sola, who had written it specifically for him. The libretto was based on the story of the maiden in the tower, which is a famous episode in the Kalevala. Sibelius was initially hesitant to accept the libretto, but eventually, he began working on the music.\n\n### Premiere\n\nThe Maiden in the Tower premiered on March 27, 1913, at the Finnish National Opera in Helsinki. The production was a joint effort between the opera and the Finnish Music Institute, and it featured a cast of Finnish singers. The reception was mixed, with some critics praising the music and others finding it too experimental.\n\n### Withdrawal and suppression\n\nIn the years following the premiere, Sibelius became increasingly dissatisfied with the opera. He felt that it did not meet his artistic standards, and he began to distance himself from the work. In 1914, he even went so far as to withdraw the opera from the repertoire, citing concerns about its suitability for performance.\n\n### Posthumous revival\n\nIn the 1980s, interest in Sibelius's music began to grow, and The Maiden in the Tower was rediscovered by scholars and musicologists. A recording of the opera was made in 1981, which helped to revive interest in the work. In recent years, the opera has been performed on several occasions, including a production at the Finnish National Opera in 2013.\n\n**Structure and roles**\n\nThe Maiden in the Tower is an opera in one act, with a single scene. The music is written for a small ensemble, consisting of a solo voice, a chorus, and a small orchestra. The opera tells the story of a maiden who is imprisoned in a tower and must be rescued by her lover.\n\n**Synopsis**\n\nThe opera opens with the maiden, Aino, singing a lament as she sits in her tower. She is joined by a chorus of women, who sing of her beauty and her fate. Aino's lover, Lemminkäinen, appears, and the two sing a duet, pledging their love for each other. However, Aino's father, Ilmarinen, appears, and he refuses to allow Lemminkäinen to marry Aino. The opera ends with Aino's lament, as she is left alone in her tower.\n\n**Music**\n\nThe music in The Maiden in the Tower is some of Sibelius's most experimental and innovative. He uses a range of techniques, including atonality and polytonality, to create a unique and expressive sound. The opera features a number of memorable melodies, including Aino's lament and the chorus's song of the maiden's beauty.\n\n**Context and analysis**\n\n### The plot as allegory\n\nThe Maiden in the Tower can be seen as an allegory for the struggle between individual freedom and societal convention. Aino is trapped in her tower, symbolizing the constraints placed on women in Finnish society during the early 20th century. Lemminkäinen's attempts to rescue her represent the desire for freedom and love that is stifled by societal norms.\n\n### Opera and Finland's language strife\n\nThe Maiden in the Tower was written at a time of great linguistic and cultural upheaval in Finland. The country was struggling to define its identity and establish its place in the world. Sibelius's opera reflects this tension, using the story of the maiden in the tower as a metaphor for the struggle between different languages and cultures.\n\n### Later opinions of Sibelius's music\n\nIn the years following Sibelius's death, his music fell out of favor. Many critics saw him as a conservative and outdated composer, and his work was largely forgotten. However, in recent years, Sibelius's music has undergone a major revival, and he is now recognized as one of the greatest composers of the 20th century.\n\n### Reasons for post-1981 neglect\n\nThe Maiden in the Tower was neglected for many years following its premiere. There are a number of reasons for this, including the opera's experimental nature and the fact that it was written during a time of great cultural and linguistic upheaval in Finland. Additionally, Sibelius's own distance from the work may have contributed to its neglect.\n\n**Discography**\n\nA recording of The Maiden in the Tower was made in 1981, featuring a cast of Finnish singers. The recording was released on the Finnish record label, Ondine. In recent years, the opera has been performed on several occasions, including a production at the Finnish National Opera in 2013.\n\n**Notes, references, and sources**\n\nThe Maiden in the Tower is a complex and multifaceted work that reflects the cultural and artistic values of early 20th-century Finland. Its experimental nature and use of atonality and polytonality make it a fascinating example of Sibelius's innovative approach to composition.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"The_Maiden_in_the_Tower\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Composition\n##Premiere\n##Withdrawal and suppression\n##Posthumous revival\n#Structure and roles\n#Synopsis\n#Music\n#Context and analysis\n##The plot as allegory\n##Opera and Finland's language strife\n##Later opinions of Sibelius's music\n##Reasons for post-1981 neglect\n#Discography\n#Notes, references, and sources\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The election saw the Labor Party, led by Chris Minns, defeat the Liberal Party, led by Dominic Perrottet, in a closely contested campaign.\n\nBackground\n==========\n\nPrevious election\n----------------\n\nThe 2019 New South Wales state election was held on 23 March 2019, and saw the Liberal-National coalition government, led by Gladys Berejiklian, win a majority of seats in the Legislative Assembly. However, the election saw a significant swing against the government, with the Labor Party gaining several seats.\n\nChange of premiership, resignations and minority government\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn October 2022, Gladys Berejiklian resigned as Premier of New South Wales, and was replaced by Dominic Perrottet. However, Perrottet's leadership was short-lived, and he resigned as Premier in January 2023, following a party room coup. Chris Minns, the leader of the Labor Party, became the new Premier, and led the party into the 2023 state election.\n\nPossibility of a hung parliament\n---------------------------------\n\nFollowing the resignation of Dominic Perrottet, there was a possibility that the 2023 state election could result in a hung parliament. This was due to the fact that the Labor Party was likely to win several seats, but the Liberal Party was still expected to hold a number of seats. A hung parliament would have meant that no party had a clear majority, and would have required the formation of a coalition government.\n\nCampaign\n--------\n\nPolicies\n--------\n\nThe Labor Party campaigned on a number of key policies, including a $15 billion infrastructure program, increased funding for public schools and hospitals, and a commitment to reduce emissions and transition to renewable energy.\n\nThe Liberal Party, on the other hand, campaigned on a number of policies aimed at reducing the cost of living, including a freeze on electricity prices and a reduction in the state's stamp duty.\n\nLeaders' debates\n----------------\n\nThe leaders of the two major parties, Chris Minns and Mark Speakman, participated in a number of debates during the campaign. These debates were broadcast on television and online, and allowed voters to hear the leaders' policies and vision for the state.\n\nRedistribution\n-------------\n\nIn the lead-up to the election, the boundaries of several electoral districts were changed due to redistribution. This meant that some voters were transferred to different districts, and some districts were abolished or created.\n\nRegistered parties\n-----------------\n\nA total of 48 parties registered to contest the 2023 state election. These parties included the Labor Party, Liberal Party, Nationals, Greens, and a number of smaller parties and independents.\n\nResults\n--------\n\nLegislative Assembly\n-------------------\n\nThe Labor Party won 48 seats in the Legislative Assembly, while the Liberal Party won 10 seats. The Nationals won 3 seats, and there were 5 independents elected.\n\nSeats changing hands\n---------------------\n\nA number of seats changed hands during the election, with the Labor Party gaining several seats from the Liberal Party. Some of the key seats that changed hands included:\n\n* Cessnock: Won by the Labor Party\n* Cootamundra: Won by the Nationals\n* Hawkesbury: Won by the Labor Party\n* Manly: Won by the Labor Party\n* Miranda: Won by the Liberal Party\n* Newcastle: Won by the Labor Party\n* Penrith: Won by the Labor Party\n* Ryde: Won by the Labor Party\n* The Entrance: Won by the Labor Party\n\nLegislative Council\n------------------\n\nThe Labor Party won 26 seats in the Legislative Council, while the Liberal Party won 13 seats. The Greens won 3 seats, and there were 3 independents elected.\n\nElectoral pendulums\n-------------------\n\nPre-election pendulum\n---------------------\n\nPrior to the election, the electoral pendulum suggested that the Labor Party had a strong chance of winning the election.

The fires burned across three main islands: Maui, Hawaiʻi Island, and Oʻahu, affecting thousands of people and causing significant damage to property and the environment.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Wildfire risk\n\nHawaii is considered to be a high-risk state for wildfires due to its dry climate, strong trade winds, and abundant vegetation. The state's dry season, which typically runs from May to October, creates an environment conducive to wildfires. Additionally, Hawaii's unique geology, with its mix of volcanic and non-volcanic areas, can create a tinderbox of fuels that can spread quickly.\n\n### Weather factors\n\nWeather conditions played a significant role in the spread of the wildfires. A prolonged heatwave, combined with strong winds and low humidity, created a perfect storm for the fires to spread rapidly. The dry conditions were exacerbated by a lack of rainfall, which made it difficult for firefighters to contain the blazes.\n\n**List of wildfires**\n\nThe following is a list of some of the major wildfires that occurred during the 2023 Hawaii wildfires:\n\n**Maui**\n\n### Kula\n\nThe Kula wildfire began on August 15, 2023, in the Kula district of Maui. The fire burned over 5,000 acres of land, forcing the evacuation of hundreds of residents. The fire was eventually contained on August 20, 2023, but not before causing significant damage to property and the environment.\n\n### Lahaina\n\nThe Lahaina wildfire began on August 20, 2023, in the historic town of Lahaina. The fire burned through the town's historic district, destroying several buildings and forcing the evacuation of hundreds of residents. The fire was eventually contained on August 22, 2023, but not before causing significant damage to property and the environment.\n\n### Pūlehu-Kīhei\n\nThe Pūlehu-Kīhei wildfire began on August 22, 2023, in the Pūlehu-Kīhei district of Maui. The fire burned over 10,000 acres of land, forcing the evacuation of hundreds of residents. The fire was eventually contained on August 25, 2023, but not before causing significant damage to property and the environment.\n\n### Other fires\n\nSeveral other smaller wildfires broke out across Maui during the 2023 Hawaii wildfires, including the Honokohau wildfire, which burned over 1,000 acres of land, and the Kaupo wildfire, which burned over 2,000 acres of land.\n\n**Hawaiʻi Island**\n\n### Puna\n\nThe Puna wildfire began on August 25, 2023, in the Puna district of Hawaiʻi Island. The fire burned over 20,000 acres of land, forcing the evacuation of hundreds of residents. The fire was eventually contained on September 1, 2023, but not before causing significant damage to property and the environment.\n\n### Kona\n\nThe Kona wildfire began on September 1, 2023, in the Kona district of Hawaiʻi Island. The fire burned over 5,000 acres of land, forcing the evacuation of hundreds of residents. The fire was eventually contained on September 3, 2023, but not before causing significant damage to property and the environment.\n\n**Oʻahu**\n\n### Ko Olina\n\nThe Ko Olina wildfire began on September 3, 2023, in the Ko Olina district of Oʻahu. The fire burned over 1,000 acres of land, forcing the evacuation of hundreds of residents. The fire was eventually contained on September 5, 2023, but not before causing significant damage to property and the environment.\n\n**Impact**\n\nThe 2023 Hawaii wildfires had a significant impact on the state's residents, visitors, and the environment.\n\n### Casualties\n\nThere were no reported fatalities from the wildfires, but several people were injured while trying to evacuate or fighting the fires.\n\n### Damage\n\nThe wildfires caused significant damage to property, including homes, businesses, and infrastructure. The total cost of the damage was estimated to be over $1 billion.\n\n### Environment\n\nThe wildfires had a devastating impact on the environment, destroying thousands of acres of land and habitats. The fires also released large amounts of air pollution, affecting the health and well-being of residents and visitors.\n\n### Evacuations\n\nThousands of residents and visitors were forced to evacuate their homes and businesses due to the wildfires. The evacuations were managed by the state's emergency management agency, which worked with local authorities to ensure the safe relocation of those affected.\n\n### Wildlife and pets\n\nThe wildfires had a significant impact on Hawaii's wildlife, including rare and endangered species. Many animals were displaced or killed by the fires, and conservation efforts were put in place to protect those affected.\n\n**Legal proceedings**\n\nSeveral lawsuits were filed against the state and local governments, as well as private companies, for their role in the wildfires. The lawsuits claimed that the defendants were negligent in their response to the fires and failed to take adequate precautions to prevent them.\n\n**Response**\n\nThe response to the 2023 Hawaii wildfires was led by the state's emergency management agency, which worked with local authorities, federal agencies, and international partners to contain the fires and provide support to those affected.\n\n### Federal government\n\nThe federal government provided significant assistance to the state, including funding, personnel, and equipment. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) declared the fires a disaster and provided millions of dollars in aid to the affected areas.\n\n### State government\n\nThe state government played a crucial role in the response to the wildfires, including mobilizing emergency responders, providing shelter and food to those affected, and coordinating with local authorities.\n\n### International assistance\n\nSeveral countries provided assistance to Hawaii, including Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Hungary. The international community came together to support the state in its time of need.\n\n### Japan\n\nJapan provided $1 million in funding to support the response to the wildfires. The country also sent a team of experts to help contain the fires and provide support to those affected.\n\n### South Korea\n\nSouth Korea provided $500,000 in funding to support the response to the wildfires. The country also sent a team of experts to help contain the fires and provide support to those affected.\n\n### Taiwan\n\nTaiwan provided $200,000 in funding to support the response to the wildfires. The country also sent a team of experts to help contain the fires and provide support to those affected.\n\n### Hungary\n\nHungary provided $100,000 in funding to support the response to the wildfires. The country also sent a team of experts to help contain the fires and provide support to those affected.\n\n**Fundraising and donations**\n\nSeveral fundraising campaigns were launched to support those affected by the wildfires. The campaigns raised millions of dollars in donations, which were used to provide shelter, food, and other essential services to those affected.\n\n**Concerns about preparedness**\n\nThe 2023 Hawaii wildfires raised concerns about the state's preparedness for natural disasters. The fires highlighted the need for improved emergency planning, better communication, and increased funding for firefighting efforts.\n\n### New warning programs\n\nIn response to the wildfires, the state launched several new warning programs to help prevent future disasters. The programs included improved evacuation routes, enhanced emergency alerts, and increased funding for firefighting efforts.\n\n**Conspiracy theories**\n\nSeveral conspiracy theories emerged in the wake of the wildfires, including claims that the fires were intentionally set by individuals or groups. However, there was no evidence to support these claims, and the official investigation concluded that the fires were caused by a combination of natural and human factors.\n\n**See also**\n\n* List of wildfires in Hawaii\n* Hawaii Emergency Management Agency\n* Federal Emergency Management Agency\n* International assistance in the 2023 Hawaii wildfires\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is based on publicly available information and may not reflect the official views or statements of the state or federal governments.\n\n**References**\n\n* This article does not include any citations or references.\n\n**Further reading**\n\n* \"2023 Hawaii Wildfires: A Review of the Response and Recovery Efforts\" (2024)\n* \"The Impact of the 2023 Hawaii Wildfires on the State's Economy\" (2024)\n* \"Hawaii's Emergency Management Agency: A Review of the Response to the 2023 Wildfires\" (2024)\n\n**External links**\n\n* Hawaii Emergency Management Agency\n* Federal Emergency Management Agency\n* International assistance in the 2023 Hawaii wildfires\n* Fundraising campaigns for the 2023 Hawaii wildfires", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_Hawaii_wildfires\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Wildfire risk\n##Weather factors\n#List of wildfires\n#Timeline\n##Maui\n###Kula\n###Lahaina\n###Pūlehu-Kīhei\n###Other fires\n##Hawaiʻi Island\n##Oʻahu\n#Impact\n##Casualties\n##Damage\n##Environment\n##Evacuations\n##Wildlife and pets\n#Legal proceedings\n#Response\n##Federal government\n##State government\n##International assistance\n###Japan\n###South Korea\n###Taiwan\n###Hungary\n##Fundraising and donations\n##Concerns about preparedness\n###New warning programs\n##Conspiracy theories\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

They are one of the three primary domains of life, the others being Archaea and Bacteria.\n\nThe diversity of eukaryotes is vast, encompassing a wide range of organisms, from single-celled protists to multicellular plants, animals, fungi, and protozoa. Eukaryotes can be found in almost every habitat on Earth, from the freezing cold to the scorching hot, and from the deepest ocean trenches to the highest mountain peaks.\n\n**Distinguishing features**\n\n### Nucleus\n\nOne of the most distinctive features of eukaryotes is the presence of a well-defined nucleus, which is a membrane-bound organelle that contains the cell's genetic material. The nucleus is typically spherical in shape and is located near the center of the cell. It is surrounded by a double membrane called the nuclear envelope, which regulates the flow of materials in and out of the nucleus.\n\nThe nucleus is a critical component of eukaryotic cells, as it houses the cell's DNA and plays a central role in the regulation of gene expression. In eukaryotes, the nucleus is typically much larger than the nucleus found in prokaryotic cells, which lack a true nucleus.\n\n### Biochemistry\n\nEukaryotes have a range of biochemical processes that are distinct from those of prokaryotes. For example, eukaryotes have a more complex system of carbohydrate metabolism, which includes the presence of a cell wall and the use of starch and cellulose as storage molecules. Eukaryotes also have a more complex system of protein synthesis, which includes the use of ribosomes and the presence of a variety of post-translational modifications.\n\nIn addition, eukaryotes have a range of specialized biochemical pathways that are not found in prokaryotes. For example, eukaryotes have a system for synthesizing cholesterol, a complex molecule that is essential for the production of cell membranes. Eukaryotes also have a system for synthesizing melanin, a pigment that is responsible for skin and hair color in animals.\n\n### Internal membranes\n\nEukaryotic cells are characterized by the presence of a variety of internal membranes, which are often organized into complex systems. For example, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a network of membranous tubules that is involved in protein synthesis and folding. The ER is often associated with ribosomes, which synthesize proteins that are destined for secretion or insertion into the cell membrane.\n\nOther internal membranes include the Golgi apparatus, which is a complex organelle that is involved in protein modification and sorting, and the lysosomes, which are membrane-bound sacs that contain digestive enzymes. Eukaryotic cells often have a range of other internal membranes, including mitochondria, chloroplasts, and peroxisomes.\n\n### Mitochondria\n\nMitochondria are membrane-bound organelles that are responsible for generating energy for the cell. They are often referred to as the \"powerhouses\" of the cell, as they produce most of the cell's ATP through a process called cellular respiration. Mitochondria are found in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells and are typically bean-shaped.\n\nMitochondria have their own DNA, which is separate from the DNA found in the nucleus. This DNA is responsible for encoding a range of genes that are involved in the production of proteins that are essential for mitochondrial function. Mitochondria are thought to have evolved from a group of prokaryotic cells that were engulfed by the early eukaryotic cells.\n\n### Plastids\n\nPlastids are membrane-bound organelles that are found in plant cells and are responsible for photosynthesis. They are often referred to as the \"food factories\" of the plant, as they use light energy to produce glucose and other organic compounds. Plastids are thought to have evolved from a group of prokaryotic cells that were engulfed by the early eukaryotic cells.\n\nPlastids have their own DNA, which is separate from the DNA found in the nucleus. This DNA is responsible for encoding a range of genes that are involved in the production of proteins that are essential for plastid function. Plastids are found in the cytoplasm of plant cells and are typically disk-shaped.\n\n### Cytoskeletal structures\n\nEukaryotic cells are characterized by the presence of a range of cytoskeletal structures, which are often referred to as the \"skeleton\" of the cell. These structures provide support and shape to the cell, and are involved in a range of cellular processes, including movement, division, and signaling.\n\nThe most well-known cytoskeletal structures are microtubules, microfilaments, and intermediate filaments. Microtubules are long, hollow tubes that are composed of tubulin subunits and are involved in a range of cellular processes, including mitosis and meiosis. Microfilaments are thin, thread-like structures that are composed of actin subunits and are involved in a range of cellular processes, including muscle contraction and cell signaling. Intermediate filaments are thicker, rope-like structures that are composed of a range of proteins and are involved in a range of cellular processes, including cell shape and stability.\n\n### Cell wall\n\nEukaryotic cells are often surrounded by a cell wall, which is a rigid structure that provides support and protection to the cell. The cell wall is composed of a range of molecules, including cellulose, chitin, and pectin, and is often found in plant cells and fungi.\n\nThe cell wall is critical for the survival and growth of eukaryotic cells, as it provides a barrier against pathogens and predators. In addition, the cell wall plays a role in the regulation of water and nutrient uptake by the cell. In plant cells, the cell wall is also involved in the production of cellulose, a complex molecule that is essential for plant growth and development.\n\n### Sexual reproduction\n\nEukaryotic cells often reproduce sexually, which involves the fusion of two gametes (sperm and egg) to form a new individual. This process is often referred to as fertilization, and is a critical step in the life cycle of many eukaryotic organisms.\n\nSexual reproduction involves the exchange of genetic material between the gametes, which increases genetic diversity and can lead to the evolution of new traits. In addition, sexual reproduction allows for the mixing of genetic material from different individuals, which can lead to the development of new species.\n\nThe process of sexual reproduction involves a range of cellular and molecular processes, including meiosis, fertilization, and embryogenesis. Meiosis is the process by which the gametes are produced, and involves the division of the genetic material into two identical sets. Fertilization is the process by which the gametes fuse to form a new individual, and involves the fusion of the genetic material from the two gametes. Embryogenesis is the process by which the new individual develops, and involves the growth and differentiation of the cells.\n\n**Evolution**\n\n### History of classification\n\nThe history of classification of eukaryotes dates back to the 19th century, when scientists began to recognize that eukaryotic cells were distinct from prokaryotic cells. In the early 20th century, scientists developed the five-kingdom system of classification, which included eukaryotes in the kingdoms Protista, Fungi, Plantae, and Animalia.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, scientists developed the six-kingdom system of classification, which included Eukarya as a separate kingdom. However, this system was later abandoned in favor of the three-domain system, which includes Eukarya as one of the three primary domains of life.\n\n### Phylogeny\n\nThe phylogeny of eukaryotes is a complex and still evolving field of study. However, it is generally accepted that eukaryotes diverged from a group of prokaryotic cells around 2.1 billion years ago, during the Neoproterozoic era.\n\nThe earliest eukaryotic cells were likely single-celled organisms that possessed a range of membrane-bound organelles, including mitochondria and chloroplasts. These early eukaryotic cells were likely very primitive and simple, and were able to survive in a range of environments.\n\nOver time, eukaryotic cells evolved to become more complex and diverse, and were able to develop a range of specialized features, including multicellularity, photosynthesis, and the ability to move. The development of these features allowed eukaryotic cells to occupy a wide range of ecological niches, and to become the dominant form of life on Earth.\n\n### Origin of eukaryotes\n\nThe origin of eukaryotes is still a topic of debate among scientists. However, it is generally accepted that eukaryotes arose from a group of prokaryotic cells that were engulfed by the early eukaryotic cells. This process, known as endosymbiosis, is thought to have occurred around 2.1 billion years ago, during the Neoproterozoic era.\n\nThe engulfed prokaryotic cells were likely able to survive and thrive within the eukaryotic cells, and eventually became the mitochondria and chloroplasts that are found in eukaryotic cells today. The development of these organelles allowed eukaryotic cells to become more complex and diverse, and to occupy a wide range of ecological niches.\n\n### Fossils\n\nFossils of eukaryotic cells are relatively rare, as they are often destroyed or degraded over time. However, a range of fossil evidence has been found that provides insights into the evolution of eukaryotes.\n\nFor example, the fossil record shows that eukaryotic cells were present on Earth at least 2.1 billion years ago, during the Neoproterozoic era. The earliest known eukaryotic fossils are found in rocks from this era, and are thought to represent the earliest known eukaryotic cells.\n\nIn addition, the fossil record shows that eukaryotic cells were able to occupy a wide range of ecological niches over time. For example, the fossil record shows that eukaryotic cells were able to become multicellular, photosynthetic, and motile, and were able to occupy a wide range of environments, from aquatic to terrestrial.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Eukaryotic cell\n* Prokaryote\n* Archaeon\n* Bacterium\n* Organelle\n* Mitochondria\n* Chloroplast\n* Cytoskeleton\n* Cell wall\n* Sexual reproduction\n* Meiosis\n* Fertilization\n* Embryogenesis\n\n**References**\n\n* Alberts, B., Johnson, A., Lewis, J., Raff, M., Roberts, K., & Walter, P.

His life and career were marked by controversy, exile, and a complex relationship with the Romanian state.\n\n**Early life and monastic career**\n\nVisarion Puiu was born in 1887 in Siret, a town in the county of Iași, Romania. His early life is not well documented, but it is known that he was drawn to the monastic life from a young age. He entered the monastic order and took the name Visarion, which is a derivative of the Greek name Basil.\n\nVisarion's early monastic career was marked by a strong emphasis on education and spiritual development. He studied theology and philosophy at the University of Bucharest and later at the University of Athens. He was ordained as a deacon in 1910 and as a priest in 1912.\n\n**Metropolitan of Bukovina**\n\nIn 1916, Visarion was appointed as the Metropolitan of Bukovina, a region in northwestern Romania. This appointment was significant, as Bukovina was a culturally and ethnically diverse region, with a large population of Ukrainians, Poles, and Germans.\n\nDuring his tenure as Metropolitan, Visarion worked to promote the interests of the Romanian Orthodox Church in Bukovina. He established a number of churches and monasteries, and he played a key role in the development of the region's educational and cultural institutions.\n\n**Exarch of Transnistria**\n\nIn 1925, Visarion was appointed as the Exarch of Transnistria, a region in eastern Romania. This appointment was also significant, as Transnistria was a region with a large population of Russians and Ukrainians.\n\nAs Exarch of Transnistria, Visarion worked to promote the interests of the Romanian Orthodox Church in the region. He established a number of churches and monasteries, and he played a key role in the development of the region's educational and cultural institutions.\n\n**Exile**\n\nVisarion's career was marked by controversy and exile. In 1939, he was accused of being a Soviet spy and was arrested by the Romanian authorities. He was later released, but he was forced to flee Romania and seek exile in Nazi Germany.\n\n**Voyage to Croatia and exile in Nazi Germany**\n\nVisarion's journey to Croatia and his subsequent exile in Nazi Germany were marked by a complex series of events. In 1940, he traveled to Croatia, where he met with the country's leader, Ante Pavelić. Pavelić was a fascist who had come to power in 1939, and Visarion was drawn to his ideology.\n\nVisarion spent several years in Croatia, where he worked to promote the interests of the Romanian Orthodox Church. He also became involved in the country's fascist movement, which was closely tied to the Nazi Party in Germany.\n\nIn 1943, Visarion was forced to flee Croatia and seek exile in Nazi Germany. He spent several years in Germany, where he worked as a chaplain in the Romanian army.\n\n**Exile in Italy and trial for war crimes**\n\nAfter the war, Visarion was forced to flee Germany and seek exile in Italy. He spent several years in Italy, where he was placed on trial for war crimes.\n\nVisarion was accused of collaborating with the Nazis during the war and of being involved in the persecution of Jews and other minority groups. He was found guilty of these crimes and was sentenced to several years in prison.\n\n**Bishop of the Romanian Orthodox Diocese of Western Europe**\n\nIn the 1950s, Visarion was released from prison and was appointed as the Bishop of the Romanian Orthodox Diocese of Western Europe. This appointment was significant, as it marked a turning point in Visarion's career.\n\nAs Bishop of the Romanian Orthodox Diocese of Western Europe, Visarion worked to promote the interests of the Romanian Orthodox Church in the region. He established a number of churches and monasteries, and he played a key role in the development of the region's educational and cultural institutions.\n\n**Final years and death**\n\nVisarion spent several years as Bishop of the Romanian Orthodox Diocese of Western Europe. He died in 1965, at the age of 78. His death marked the end of a complex and tumultuous career, marked by controversy, exile, and a complex relationship with the Romanian state.\n\n**Posthumous evaluation**\n\nVisarion's legacy is complex and multifaceted. Some have praised him as a dedicated and devoted servant of the Romanian Orthodox Church, while others have criticized him for his involvement in fascist and nationalist movements.\n\nIn recent years, Visarion's legacy has been reevaluated in light of new historical research and a growing understanding of the complexities of Romanian history. While some still praise him as a hero of the Romanian Orthodox Church, others have come to view him as a complex and flawed figure, whose actions were shaped by the tumultuous events of his time.\n\n**Notes**\n\nVisarion Puiu's life and career are the subject of ongoing historical research and debate. This article is intended to provide a neutral and informative overview of his life and career, and to encourage further study and discussion of this complex and multifaceted figure.\n\n**References**\n\n* \n* \n* \n\n**Bibliography**\n\n* \n* \n* \n\n**External links**\n\n*", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Visarion_Puiu\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life and monastic career\n#Metropolitan of Bukovina\n#Exarch of Transnistria\n#Exile\n##Voyage to Croatia and exile in Nazi Germany\n##Exile in Italy and trial for war crimes\n##Bishop of the Romanian Orthodox Diocese of Western Europe\n##Final years and death\n#Posthumous evaluation\n#Notes\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He is best known for his military campaigns and conquests in Wales and Scotland, as well as his impact on English law and government.\n\nEarly years, 1239–1263\n\nChildhood and marriage\nEdward was born in Westminster, London, to King Henry III and his wife, Eleanor of Provence. He was the eldest son of the royal couple and was destined for a life of royal service. Edward's early years were marked by a traditional education, which included training in martial skills and the study of theology. In 1254, at the age of 15, Edward married Eleanor of Castile, a member of the royal family of Castile, in a marriage arranged by his father. The couple had 14 children together, including the future Edward II.\n\nEarly ambitions\nAs a young man, Edward was ambitious and eager to assert his independence from his father. In 1258, he participated in the Provisions of Oxford, a rebellion against his father's rule, but ultimately failed to achieve his goals. Edward's father, however, remained wary of his son's ambitions and kept him at a distance, appointing him as the Governor of Gascony in 1254 and later as the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in 1259.\n\nCivil war and crusades, 1264–1273\n\nSecond Barons' War\nIn 1264, Edward's father was captured by the forces of Simon de Montfort, a powerful baron who had risen up in rebellion against the king. Edward was forced to flee to France, where he spent several years in exile. In 1265, he returned to England and allied himself with the forces of the Earl of Gloucester, who were fighting against de Montfort's followers. Edward's military skills and leadership played a key role in the eventual defeat of de Montfort's forces at the Battle of Evesham in 1265.\n\nCrusade and accession\nIn 1270, Edward joined the Ninth Crusade, led by his father, who was seeking to reclaim the Holy Land from Muslim forces. Edward's participation in the crusade was marked by several military victories, but ultimately, the crusade was unsuccessful, and Edward's father died in 1272. Edward returned to England, where he was crowned king by the Archbishop of Canterbury in 1274.\n\nEarly reign, 1274–1296\n\nConquest of Wales\nEdward's early reign was marked by a series of military campaigns against the Welsh, who had long resisted English rule. In 1277, Edward invaded Wales, and his forces defeated the Welsh at the Battle of Devynnock. The following year, Edward's forces captured the Welsh stronghold of Gwynllyw, and the Welsh prince, Llywelyn ap Gruffydd, was forced to surrender. Edward's conquest of Wales was completed in 1282, when his forces defeated Llywelyn's brother, Dafydd ap Gruffydd, at the Battle of Moel-y-don.\n\nDiplomacy and war on the Continent\nDuring his early reign, Edward also engaged in several diplomatic and military campaigns on the Continent. In 1278, he was involved in a dispute with the King of France over the County of Flanders, and in 1283, he launched a military campaign against the County of Gascony, which was a vassal state of the French crown.\n\nGreat Cause\nIn 1291, Edward launched the Great Cause, a series of legal proceedings that sought to establish English sovereignty over Scotland. The Great Cause was sparked by the death of the Scottish king, Alexander III, who had left no clear heir to the throne. Edward's claim to the Scottish throne was based on his descent from David I, a Scottish king who had married into the English royal family. The Great Cause was a complex and contentious process that involved several years of litigation and eventually led to the Treaty of Birgham, which recognized Edward's sovereignty over Scotland.\n\nGovernment and law\n\nCharacter as king\nEdward was known for his strong personality and his ability to assert his authority over his subjects. He was a skilled military leader and a shrewd politician who was able to navigate the complex web of alliances and rivalries that characterized the medieval world. Edward's character has been described as authoritarian, but he was also known for his sense of justice and his commitment to upholding the law.\n\nAdministration and the law\nEdward's reign was marked by a significant expansion of English law and administration. He established the Council of the North, a governing body that was responsible for administering justice in the north of England, and he also established the office of the Lord High Treasurer, which was responsible for managing the royal finances. Edward's laws were codified in the Statute of Westminster of 1275, which established the principle of trial by jury and the right to a fair trial.\n\nFinances and Parliament\nEdward's reign was marked by a significant expansion of the English economy, which was driven by a combination of trade, agriculture, and industrial growth. The king's finances were also significantly improved, thanks to the introduction of a new system of taxation and the establishment of a professional civil service. Edward's relationship with Parliament was complex and often contentious, but he was able to use Parliament to secure his own power and influence.\n\nParliament and the expulsion of the Jews\nIn 1290, Edward I expelled the Jews from England, a move that was motivated by a combination of economic and religious factors. The expulsion of the Jews was a significant event in English history, and it had a profound impact on the Jewish community in England.\n\nAdministration in Ireland\nDuring his reign, Edward also established a system of administration in Ireland, which was based on a combination of military and judicial power. The Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, who was appointed by the king, was responsible for administering justice and maintaining order in the country. Edward's administration in Ireland was marked by a series of military campaigns against the Irish, who had long resisted English rule.\n\nLater reign, 1297–1307\n\nConstitutional crisis\nIn 1297, Edward faced a constitutional crisis when a group of barons, who were dissatisfied with his rule, revolted against him. The rebellion was led by the Earl of Lancaster and the Earl of Hereford, who were supported by a group of nobles and knights. Edward's forces defeated the rebels at the Battle of Falkirk in 1298, but the rebellion marked a significant turning point in his reign, as it highlighted the growing tensions between the king and his nobles.\n\nReturn to Scotland\nIn 1296, Edward launched a military campaign against Scotland, which was sparked by a dispute over the Scottish crown. Edward's forces defeated the Scots at the Battle of Stirling Bridge, but he was ultimately defeated at the Battle of Falkirk in 1298. Edward's campaign in Scotland was marked by a series of military setbacks and eventual defeat, which weakened his position as king.\n\nDeath and burial\nEdward I died on July 7, 1307, at Burgh-by-Sands, near the English-Scottish border, while on a military campaign against the Scots. He was buried in Westminster Abbey, where his son, Edward II, would later be buried. Edward's death marked the end of an era in English history, and it paved the way for the reign of his son, who would go on to face significant challenges and controversies of his own.\n\nLegacy\nEdward I's legacy is complex and multifaceted. He was a skilled military leader and a shrewd politician who was able to navigate the complex web of alliances and rivalries that characterized the medieval world. Edward's reign was marked by a significant expansion of English law and administration, which had a profound impact on the development of English society. However, his reign was also marked by controversy and conflict, particularly with regard to his treatment of the Welsh and the Scots.\n\nFamily\n\nFirst marriage\nEdward's first marriage was to Eleanor of Castile, which took place in 1254. The couple had 14 children together, including the future Edward II.\n\nSecond marriage\nEdward's second marriage was to Margaret of France, which took place in 1299. The couple had no children together.\n\nGenealogical table\n\nSee also\n\n* History of England\n* History of Scotland\n* History of Wales\n* List of English monarchs\n* List of Scottish monarchs\n* List of Welsh monarchs\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\n* Barrow, G.

The election was marked by significant changes to the electoral law and the creation of a joint opposition list.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Amendment of the electoral law\n\nIn 2021, the Hungarian government, led by Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, introduced an amendment to the electoral law, which aimed to reduce the number of electoral districts from 106 to 106 single-member districts. The amendment also introduced a new electoral system, where each party would receive a number of seats proportional to its share of the national vote. This change was seen as an attempt to consolidate the government's power and reduce the influence of opposition parties.\n\n### Creation of joint opposition list\n\nIn response to the changes to the electoral law, the opposition parties decided to create a joint list for the election. The joint list, which was led by the Democratic Coalition, included seven opposition parties: the Democratic Coalition, the Social Democratic Party, the Hungarian Socialist Party, the LMP – Hungary's Green Party, the Momentum Movement, the Dialogue for Hungary, and the Together party. The joint list was seen as a way for the opposition to present a united front against the government and increase their chances of winning the election.\n\n### Opposition primary\n\nIn the months leading up to the election, the joint opposition list conducted a primary election, where voters could choose between different candidates to represent their constituencies. The primary election was seen as a way to select the most viable candidates and increase the chances of the joint list winning the election.\n\n**Electoral system**\n\nThe 2022 Hungarian parliamentary election used a mixed electoral system, where 106 single-member districts elected one member each, and 93 members were elected from party lists. The party list system used a proportional representation system, where seats were allocated to parties based on their share of the national vote.\n\n**Parties and coalitions**\n\nA total of 19 parties and coalitions participated in the election, including the governing Fidesz-KDNP coalition and the joint opposition list. Other notable parties included the Christian Democratic People's Party, the Hungarian Liberal Party, and the Our Homeland Movement.\n\n**Opinion polls**\n\nOpinion polls conducted in the months leading up to the election showed a close contest between the governing Fidesz-KDNP coalition and the joint opposition list. However, the polls also indicated that the race was highly unpredictable and that the outcome of the election was far from certain.\n\n**Results**\n\n### Result by constituency\n\nThe election was won by the governing Fidesz-KDNP coalition, which won 135 seats in the National Assembly, including 135 seats from the single-member districts and 93 seats from the party lists. The joint opposition list won 56 seats, while the remaining 15 seats were won by other parties and coalitions.\n\n### Party list results by county and in the diaspora\n\nThe party list results showed a mixed picture, with the Fidesz-KDNP coalition winning the most votes in several counties, including Bács-Kiskun, Baranya, and Pest. However, the joint opposition list won the most votes in several other counties, including Budapest, Fejér, and Győr-Moson-Sopron.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\n### Analysis\n\nThe 2022 Hungarian parliamentary election was seen as a significant test for the governing Fidesz-KDNP coalition and the joint opposition list. The election was won by the governing coalition, but the joint opposition list was able to make significant gains and increase its representation in the National Assembly.\n\n### Conduct\n\nThe election was generally seen as well-conducted, with minimal reports of irregularities or voter suppression. However, there were some concerns raised about the use of state media and the distribution of materials by the government.\n\n### Anomalies over postal ballots\n\nThere were reports of anomalies in the distribution of postal ballots, with some voters complaining that they had not received their ballots or that they had been unable to cast their votes. These reports were investigated by the election authorities and led to some minor irregularities being reported.\n\n### International responses\n\nThe international community was closely watching the 2022 Hungarian parliamentary election, with many countries and organizations expressing concerns about the fairness and transparency of the process. The European Union, the United States, and other international organizations issued statements calling for the election to be free and fair.\n\n**See also**\n\n* 2022 Hungarian parliamentary election controversy\n* Hungarian opposition\n* Viktor Orbán\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The 2022 Hungarian parliamentary election was the 20th parliamentary election in Hungary since the end of World War II.\n\n**References**\n\n* None\n\n**External links**\n\n* Hungarian National Election Office – official website\n* European Parliament Election Observation Mission in Hungary 2022 – official website", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Hungarian_parliamentary_election\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Amendment of the electoral law\n##Creation of joint opposition list\n##Opposition primary\n#Electoral system\n#Parties and coalitions\n#Opinion polls\n#Results\n##Result by constituency\n##Party list results by county and in the diaspora\n#Aftermath\n##Analysis\n##Conduct\n##Anomalies over postal ballots\n##International responses\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He is widely regarded as one of the greatest pitchers in baseball history, known for his exceptional control, speed, and consistency.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nKoufax was born Sanford Braun on December 30, 1935, in Brooklyn, New York, to a Jewish family. His parents, Jack and Florence Braun, were both born in the United States, and his grandparents were immigrants from Poland and Russia. Koufax grew up in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn, where he developed a passion for baseball at a young age.\n\n##Major League tryouts\n\nKoufax tried out for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1954, but was not offered a contract. He then tried out for the Cleveland Indians in 1955, but was released. Undeterred, Koufax continued to work on his skills, eventually earning a spot with the Dodgers in 1955.\n\n**Professional Career**\n\nKoufax's professional career spanned 12 seasons, from 1955 to 1966. He played his first game with the Dodgers on April 24, 1955, and made his first start on May 7, 1955.\n\n##Early years (1955–1960)\n\nIn his early years, Koufax was a solid but not spectacular pitcher. He had a 3.38 ERA in his first season and a 3.98 ERA in his second. However, he began to show promise in 1958, with a 2.83 ERA and 14 wins.\n\n##Domination (1961–1964)\n\nKoufax's career took off in 1961, when he went 18-13 with a 2.54 ERA and 269 strikeouts. He won his first 10 games of the 1962 season, and finished the year with a 1.95 ERA and 267 strikeouts.\n\n###1961 season\n\nKoufax's 1961 season was a breakout year for the left-hander. He started the season with a 7-0 record and a 1.93 ERA, and eventually finished the year with a 2.54 ERA and 269 strikeouts. He was named to the National League All-Star team for the first time in 1961.\n\n###1962 season\n\nKoufax's 1962 season was even more impressive than his 1961 season. He started the year with a 10-0 record and a 1.95 ERA, and eventually finished the year with a 1.95 ERA and 267 strikeouts. He was named the National League Cy Young Award winner in 1962.\n\n###1963 season\n\nKoufax's 1963 season was a bit of a disappointment, as he went 11-13 with a 3.18 ERA. However, he still managed to win 10 games and strike out 248 batters.\n\n##Salary dispute\n\nKoufax's salary dispute with the Dodgers began in 1964, when he demanded a $100,000 raise, citing his value to the team and his experience. The dispute dragged on for several months, but eventually, Koufax and the Dodgers reached a compromise.\n\n###1964 season\n\nKoufax's 1964 season was a rematch of sorts, as he faced off against the Yankees in the World Series. The Dodgers won the series 4-3, with Koufax earning the save in Game 7.\n\n##Playing in pain (1965–66)\n\nKoufax's 1965 season was marred by back pain, which forced him to miss several starts. However, he still managed to win 11 games and strike out 137 batters.\n\n###1965 season\n\nKoufax's 1965 season was notable for his perfect game against the Chicago Cubs on September 9, 1965. He also pitched in the World Series, where the Dodgers lost to the Minnesota Twins.\n\n####Perfection\n\nKoufax's perfect game was his second, as he had previously pitched a perfect game against the Chicago Cubs on June 4, 1964.\n\n####World Series and Yom Kippur decision\n\nKoufax's decision to sit out the World Series due to Yom Kippur was a significant moment in baseball history. The decision sparked controversy, but also highlighted the importance of respecting different cultures and faiths.\n\n##Holdout\n\nKoufax's holdout in 1966 was a major news story, as he demanded a raise and a longer contract. The holdout eventually ended, and Koufax signed a new contract with the Dodgers.\n\n###1966 season\n\nKoufax's 1966 season was his final season in the major leagues. He went 11-8 with a 1.73 ERA, but missed several starts due to injury.\n\n##Retirement\n\nKoufax retired from baseball in 1966, at the age of 30. His legacy as one of the greatest pitchers in baseball history was cemented in his final season.\n\n**Career Overall**\n\nKoufax's career statistics are impressive:\n\n##Statistics and achievements\n\n* 3-time Cy Young Award winner\n* 8-time National League All-Star\n* 6-time National League ERA leader\n* 5-time National League strikeout leader\n* 4-time National League wins leader\n\n##Pitching style and repertoire\n\nKoufax was known for his exceptional control and speed, as well as his ability to throw a variety of pitches.

The show's enduring popularity can be attributed to its unique blend of entertainment, humor, and heartwarming stories that have become a staple of Filipino culture.\n\n**History**\n\n### RPN (1979–1989)\n\nEat Bulaga! was first broadcast on Radio Philippines Network (RPN) on July 30, 1979. The show was created by Vic del Rosario Jr. and was initially hosted by Tito Sotto, Vic Sotto, Joey de Leon, and the Donya Flor Contemplacion sisters. The show's early success was attributed to its lighthearted and comedic approach to entertainment, which resonated with the Filipino audience. During its tenure on RPN, Eat Bulaga! became a daily staple of Philippine television, with millions of viewers tuning in to watch the show's various segments.\n\n### ABS-CBN (1989–1995)\n\nIn 1989, Eat Bulaga! moved to ABS-CBN, where it continued to be a popular and influential show. The show's format remained largely unchanged, with the host tandem of Tito Sotto, Vic Sotto, and Joey de Leon becoming a household name. During its time on ABS-CBN, Eat Bulaga! introduced new segments, such as the \"EB Sa Tanghalan\" singing competition, which showcased the talents of various Filipino singers.\n\n### GMA Network (1995–2024)\n\nIn 1995, Eat Bulaga! transferred to GMA Network, where it has remained to this day.

The conflict centered on the ownership of the show's trademark, with the hosts claiming that they were the rightful owners of the Eat Bulaga! name and format. The dispute led to a split in the show's production, with the hosts launching a competing show, E.A.T. (Eat and Talk), which featured many of the same segments and hosts as Eat Bulaga!. The dispute was eventually resolved in favor of the hosts, with the court ruling that the Eat Bulaga! trademark belonged to the TVJ (Tito, Vic, Joey) tandem.\n\n### E.A.T. and TAPE's Eat Bulaga!\n\nIn response to the conflict, TAPE Inc. launched a competing show, also called Eat Bulaga!, which featured many of the same segments and hosts as the original show. The new show, however, was met with a lukewarm response from viewers, who were loyal to the original Eat Bulaga! format and hosts.\n\n### Eat Bulaga! trademark battle: TVJ emerges victorious\n\nThe conflict between the TVJ tandem and TAPE Inc. finally came to an end in 2024, with the court ruling in favor of the hosts. The ruling declared that the Eat Bulaga! trademark belonged to the TVJ tandem, effectively ending the dispute.\n\n### TV5 and RPTV (since 2024)\n\nIn 2024, the TVJ tandem, now owners of the Eat Bulaga! trademark, announced that they would be launching a new version of the show on TV5 and RPTV. The new show would feature many of the same segments and hosts as the original Eat Bulaga!, but with a fresh new format and style.\n\n**Hosts**\n\n### Current host\n\nThe current hosts of Eat Bulaga! include Vic Sotto, Joey de Leon, and Tito Sotto, who have been with the show since its inception.

The term has been used in various contexts throughout history, encompassing a range of perspectives and criticisms.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe concept of anti-Zionism predates the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948. Early Jewish and Arab opposition to Zionism, the movement that sought to create a Jewish homeland in Palestine, emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Balfour Declaration of 1917, which expressed British support for a Jewish homeland in Palestine, was met with opposition from both Jews and Arabs. The debate surrounding Zionism and anti-Zionism has continued to evolve over the years, incorporating various perspectives from different ideological and religious backgrounds.\n\nAnti-Zionism before 1948\n\n### Early Jewish Anti-Zionism\n\nJewish opposition to Zionism was present from its inception. Critics argued that the movement was too focused on establishing a Jewish state, and that it would lead to the displacement of the existing non-Jewish population in Palestine. Notable Jewish anti-Zionists included Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook's rival, Rabbi Yehiel Michel Pines, and the Jewish philosopher and writer, Ahad Ha'am.\n\n### Early Arab Anti-Zionism\n\nArab opposition to Zionism emerged in the early 20th century, with many Arabs viewing the movement as a threat to their land and their way of life. Arab leaders, including the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Hajj Amin al-Husseini, opposed the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. They argued that the Balfour Declaration was a betrayal of the Arab people and that it would lead to the displacement of the Arab population.\n\n### Reactions to the Balfour Declaration\n\nThe Balfour Declaration, issued by the British government in 1917, expressed support for the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. The declaration was met with widespread opposition from both Jews and Arabs. Many Jews saw the declaration as a long-awaited recognition of their right to a national homeland. However, many Arabs viewed the declaration as a threat to their land and their way of life.\n\n### Anti-Zionism in the 1920s-1930s\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, anti-Zionism continued to evolve as a distinct movement. The Arab Higher Committee, established in 1936, played a key role in organizing opposition to Zionism. The committee's leaders, including the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, argued that Zionism was a threat to Arab rights and that it would lead to the displacement of the Arab population.\n\n### The Biltmore Programme and its Anti-Zionism Fall-out\n\nThe Biltmore Programme, adopted by the Zionist movement in 1942, called for the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine. The programme was met with opposition from both Jews and Arabs, who saw it as a threat to their rights and interests. The programme's emphasis on the establishment of a Jewish state led to a significant increase in anti-Zionist sentiment among both Jews and Arabs.\n\n### Religious\n\nReligious opposition to Zionism has been present throughout history. Some Christians have argued that the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine would lead to the fulfillment of Christian prophecies, while others have seen it as a threat to their faith. In the Islamic world, many have viewed Zionism as a form of imperialism and a threat to Islamic values.\n\nAnti-Zionism after World War II and the creation of Israel\n\n### 1947-1948\n\nThe creation of the state of Israel in 1948 led to a significant increase in anti-Zionist sentiment. Many Arabs viewed the establishment of the state as a threat to their land and their way of life. The Arab-Israeli War of 1948 further deepened the divide between Arabs and Jews, leading to a significant increase in anti-Zionist sentiment.\n\n### Soviet Union\n\nThe Soviet Union played a significant role in promoting anti-Zionism in the post-war period. The Soviet government saw Zionism as a form of nationalism that was incompatible with the principles of socialism. The Soviet Union's opposition to Zionism was reflected in its support for the Arab cause and its criticism of Israeli policies.\n\n### Arab and Palestinian Anti-Zionism\n\nArab and Palestinian opposition to Zionism has continued to evolve over the years. Many Arabs view Zionism as a form of imperialism and a threat to their rights and interests. Palestinian opposition to Zionism is particularly strong, with many Palestinians viewing the movement as a form of oppression and a threat to their very existence.\n\n### Perception of Zionism as Racism\n\nMany have viewed Zionism as a form of racism, arguing that it is based on a false premise that Jews are a distinct and separate people. This perception has been reinforced by the Israeli government's treatment of the Palestinian population, including its policies of occupation and apartheid.\n\n### During the Cold War\n\nDuring the Cold War, anti-Zionism was often linked to anti-communism. Many anti-communists saw Zionism as a form of socialism or communism, and therefore as a threat to Western values. However, this perception has largely been discredited, and anti-Zionism is now seen as a distinct and separate movement.\n\n### After the Cold War\n\nIn the post-Cold War period, anti-Zionism has continued to evolve as a distinct movement. Many have argued that Zionism is a form of colonialism, and that it is based on a false premise that Jews are a distinct and separate people. Others have seen Zionism as a form of imperialism, and have argued that it is a threat to Arab and Palestinian rights and interests.\n\n### Islamic Perspectives\n\nIslamic opposition to Zionism has been present throughout history. Many Muslims view Zionism as a form of imperialism and a threat to Islamic values. Some have argued that Zionism is based on a false premise that Jews are a distinct and separate people, and that it is therefore incompatible with Islamic principles.\n\n### Left-wing Politics\n\nLeft-wing opposition to Zionism has been present throughout history. Many left-wingers have argued that Zionism is a form of imperialism and a threat to Arab and Palestinian rights and interests. Others have seen Zionism as a form of racism, and have argued that it is based on a false premise that Jews are a distinct and separate people.\n\n### Christian Anti-Zionism\n\nChristian opposition to Zionism has been present throughout history. Some Christians have argued that the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine would lead to the fulfillment of Christian prophecies, while others have seen it as a threat to their faith. In the Islamic world, many have viewed Zionism as a form of imperialism and a threat to Islamic values.\n\n### Protestants\n\nProtestant opposition to Zionism has been present throughout history. Many Protestants have argued that the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine would lead to the fulfillment of Christian prophecies, while others have seen it as a threat to their faith.\n\n### Catholics\n\nCatholic opposition to Zionism has been present throughout history. Many Catholics have argued that the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine would lead to the fulfillment of Christian prophecies, while others have seen it as a threat to their faith.\n\n### Haredi Judaism\n\nHaredi opposition to Zionism has been present throughout history. Many Haredis have argued that the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine would lead to the fulfillment of Jewish law and tradition, while others have seen it as a threat to their faith.\n\nAllegations of Antisemitism\n\n### Jewish Right to a State\n\nMany have argued that Jewish opposition to Zionism is based on a false premise that Jews have a right to a state. However, this argument has been discredited, and many Jews have argued that the concept of a Jewish state is based on a false premise that Jews are a distinct and separate people.\n\n### Equating and Correlating Anti-Zionism with Antisemitism\n\nMany have argued that anti-Zionism is equivalent to antisemitism, and that it is based on a false premise that Jews are a distinct and separate people. However, this argument has been discredited, and many have argued that anti-Zionism is a distinct and separate movement.\n\n### View that the Two are Not Interlinked\n\nMany have argued that anti-Zionism and antisemitism are not interlinked, and that they are distinct and separate movements. However, this argument has been discredited, and many have argued that anti-Zionism is a form of antisemitism.\n\n### Shifting Positions on the Zionist/Anti-Zionist Spectrum\n\nMany have shifted their positions on the Zionist/Anti-Zionist spectrum over the years. Some have moved from being pro-Zionist to anti-Zionist, while others have moved from being anti-Zionist to pro-Zionist.\n\n### Far-right Politics\n\nFar-right opposition to Zionism has been present throughout history. Many far-right politicians have argued that Zionism is a form of socialism or communism, and that it is therefore a threat to Western values.\n\n### Conspiracy Theories\n\nConspiracy theories surrounding Zionism have been present throughout history. Many have argued that Zionism is a form of imperialism or a threat to Western values, and that it is based on a false premise that Jews are a distinct and separate people.\n\nSee also\n\n* Zionism\n* Anti-Semitism\n* Arab-Israeli Conflict\n* Palestinian Nationalism\n* Islamic Opposition to Zionism\n* Left-Wing Opposition to Zionism\n* Christian Opposition to Zionism\n\nNotes\n\nCitations\n\nSources\n\n* Bickerton, I.

The recognition of the DPR and LPR has been a contentious issue, with some countries and organizations accepting them as independent states, while others have refused to do so.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts in eastern Ukraine have a complex history, with both regions having been at the center of various regional and national movements throughout the 20th century. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Ukraine gained independence, but the Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts remained one of the most industrialized and economically developed regions in the country.\n\nIn the early 2010s, tensions began to rise in the region, as pro-Russian and pro-Ukrainian groups began to take a more prominent role in local politics. In April 2014, protests broke out in both Donetsk and Luhansk, with pro-Russian groups demanding greater autonomy and eventual independence from Ukraine.\n\nThe protests quickly escalated into violence, and on April 6, 2014, separatist leaders in Donetsk and Luhansk declared the establishment of the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic, respectively. The Ukrainian government responded by launching a military operation to quell the separatist movement, which led to the outbreak of a full-scale conflict.\n\nAftermath of Russian recognition\n\nOn February 21, 2022, Russia recognized the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics as independent states, citing the need to protect the \"rights and freedoms\" of the Russian-speaking population in eastern Ukraine. This move was widely condemned by the international community, with many countries viewing it as a pretext for a larger invasion of Ukraine.\n\nCountries and entities that recognized the DPR and LPR as independent states\n\n### UN member states\n\nThe following UN member states have recognized the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics as independent states:\n\n* Russia (February 21, 2022)\n\n### Non-UN states\n\nThe following non-UN states have recognized the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics as independent states:\n\n* Abkhazia (March 18, 2022)\n* South Ossetia (March 18, 2022)\n* Nagorno-Karabakh (April 2, 2022)\n\nPositions by other countries\n\n### Countries and entities that supported recognizing the DPR and LPR as independent states\n\n#### UN member states\n\nSeveral UN member states have expressed support for recognizing the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics as independent states, although they have not taken concrete steps to do so. These countries include:\n\n* Belarus (has diplomatic ties with the DPR and LPR)\n* Syria (has expressed support for the self-proclaimed republics)\n\n### Countries and entities that did not support recognizing the DPR and LPR as independent states\n\n#### UN member states\n\nThe overwhelming majority of UN member states have refused to recognize the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics as independent states, citing concerns over the legitimacy of the self-proclaimed republics and the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine. These countries include:\n\n* All European Union member states (except for Hungary, which has expressed some support for the DPR and LPR)\n* The United States\n* Canada\n* Australia\n* New Zealand\n* The United Kingdom\n* Many countries in Latin America and the Caribbean\n\n#### Non-UN states\n\nSeveral non-UN states have also refused to recognize the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics as independent states. These countries include:\n\n* Taiwan (has expressed opposition to the self-proclaimed republics)\n* Vatican City (has diplomatic ties with Ukraine)\n* Palestine (has diplomatic ties with Ukraine)\n\n#### International and regional organizations\n\nThe following international and regional organizations have refused to recognize the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics as independent states:\n\n* The European Union\n* The Council of Europe\n* The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE)\n* The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)\n* The United Nations Security Council (has imposed sanctions on Russia over the recognition of the DPR and LPR)\n\nSee also\n\n* 2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine\n* 2021-2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine\n* Ukraine–Russia crisis\n* Donbas war\n* Minsk agreements\n\nNotes\n\n* This article is intended to provide a factual and neutral summary of the situation.

Rowling, is a British novelist, screenwriter, and philanthropist best known for writing the Harry Potter fantasy series. Born on July 31, 1965, in Yate, Gloucestershire, England, Rowling has become one of the most successful authors in the world, with her books translated into over 80 languages and sold more than 500 million copies worldwide.\n\n**Life and Career**\n\n### **Early Life and Family**\n\nJ.K. Rowling was the eldest of two daughters born to Peter James Rowling and Anne Volant Rowling (née Dipple). Her father was a Rolls-Royce aircraft engineer, and her mother was a science technician. The family moved to Winterbourne, Bristol, when Rowling was nine months old. She spent her early years in a council house with her mother, who was a single parent after her parents' divorce. Rowling has described her childhood as \"difficult\" and \"boisterous.\" She developed a love for books and writing at an early age, often making up stories and drawing pictures.\n\n### **Secondary School and University**\n\nRowling attended Wyedean Comprehensive School in Gloucestershire, where she was an average student. However, she excelled in English language and literature. After completing her secondary education, Rowling moved to the University of Exeter, where she studied French and Classics. During her time at university, Rowling became involved in the anti-apartheid movement and developed a passion for social justice. She graduated in 1986 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in French.\n\n### **Inspiration and Mother's Death**\n\nAfter university, Rowling moved to London to work as a researcher and bilingual secretary for Amnesty International. However, she soon became dissatisfied with her job and began to focus on her writing. In 1990, Rowling's mother died of multiple sclerosis, which had a profound impact on her life. She has said that her mother's death was a turning point in her writing career, as it allowed her to explore themes of grief and loss in her work. Rowling began to develop the idea for Harry Potter while on a delayed train from Manchester to London in 1990.\n\n### **Marriage, Divorce and Single Parenthood**\n\nIn 1992, Rowling married Portuguese television journalist Jorge Arantes, and they had a daughter, Jessica, in 1993. However, the couple divorced in 1995, and Rowling became a single parent. She struggled financially and emotionally during this period, relying on welfare benefits and living in a small flat in Edinburgh. Rowling has said that her experience of poverty and single parenthood informed her writing and gave her a deeper understanding of the challenges faced by many families.\n\n### **Publishing Harry Potter**\n\nRowling's first book, \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,\" was published in 1997 by Bloomsbury Children's Books. The book was initially rejected by 12 publishers, but it eventually became a bestseller. The Harry Potter series went on to become a global phenomenon, with seven books published between 1997 and 2007. Rowling's success with Harry Potter enabled her to become one of the wealthiest authors in the world.\n\n### **Films**\n\nThe Harry Potter book series was adapted into a series of eight films, which were released between 2001 and 2011. Rowling was heavily involved in the production of the films, serving as a producer and screenwriter. The films were a critical and commercial success, grossing over $7.7 billion at the box office.\n\n### **Religion, Wealth and Remarriage**\n\nRowling has been open about her struggles with depression and anxiety, which she has attributed to her experiences of poverty and single parenthood. She has said that her faith in Christianity has helped her to cope with these challenges. In 2011, Rowling married Dr. Neil Murray, a Scottish doctor. The couple has two sons, David and Mackenzie. Rowling's wealth has enabled her to establish the Volant Charitable Trust, which supports various charitable causes.\n\n### **Adult Fiction and Robert Galbraith**\n\nIn addition to the Harry Potter series, Rowling has written several adult novels, including \"The Casual Vacancy\" (2012) and \"The Cuckoo's Calling\" (2013), which was published under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith. Rowling's crime novel, \"The Silkworm,\" was published in 2014, and \"Career of Evil\" was published in 2015. The Cormoran Strike series, written as Robert Galbraith, has been adapted into a BBC television series.\n\n### **Later Harry Potter Works**\n\nIn 2016, Rowling published \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,\" a companion book to the Harry Potter series. The book was a bestseller and was adapted into a film in 2016. Rowling has also published several companion books to the series, including \"The Tales of Beedle the Bard\" and \"Quidditch Through the Ages.\"\n\n### **Children's Stories**\n\nIn addition to the Harry Potter series, Rowling has written several children's books, including \"The Ickabog\" (2020).

Tolkien, Philip Pullman, and Roald Dahl. She has also been influenced by her experiences as a single parent and her struggles with poverty.\n\n**Style and Themes**\n\n### **Style and Allusions**\n\nRowling's writing style is known for its vivid descriptions, complex characters, and intricate plotlines. Her use of allusions to mythology, literature, and history has been widely praised. Rowling has said that she draws inspiration from a range of sources, including mythology, fairy tales, and folk tales.\n\n### **Themes**\n\nRowling's work often explores themes of friendship, love, prejudice, and the struggle between good and evil. Her books have been praised for their nuanced portrayal of complex social issues, including poverty, racism, and sexism.\n\n**Reception**\n\nRowling's books have received widespread critical acclaim and have been praised for their imaginative world-building, complex characters, and thought-provoking themes.

Some critics have accused her of perpetuating sexist and racist stereotypes, while others have praised her for her nuanced portrayal of complex social issues.\n\n### **Religious Reactions**\n\nRowling's portrayal of magic and the supernatural has been criticized by some religious leaders, who have accused her of promoting paganism and Satanism.

From the early days of the Russian Empire to the present day, Russian cinema has produced a wide range of films that have captivated audiences around the world. This article provides an overview of the development of Russian cinema, including its history, notable films, and current trends.\n\n**Cinema of the Russian Empire**\n\nThe Russian Empire's film industry began to take shape in the early 20th century, with the establishment of the first film studios in St. Petersburg and Moscow. These early films were often silent and focused on historical and literary subjects. One of the most notable filmmakers of this era was Lev Kuleshov, who is considered one of the founders of Soviet cinema. Kuleshov's innovative use of montage and editing techniques influenced a generation of filmmakers and laid the groundwork for the development of Soviet cinema.\n\nDuring the 1910s and 1920s, Russian cinema began to gain international recognition, with films like Mikhail Kalatozov's \"The New Babylon\" (1929) and Vsevolod Pudovkin's \"Mother\" (1926) winning awards at international film festivals. These films showcased the talents of Russian filmmakers and helped establish Russia as a major player in the global film industry.\n\n**Cinema of the Soviet Union**\n\nThe Soviet Union's cinema underwent significant changes after the Russian Revolution in 1917. The new government established the Goskino film studio, which became the primary production center for Soviet cinema. Goskino produced a wide range of films, including historical dramas, comedies, and documentaries.\n\n**Early Soviet cinema (1917–1953)**\n\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, Soviet cinema experienced a period of rapid growth and innovation. Filmmakers like Sergei Eisenstein, Vsevolod Pudovkin, and Dziga Vertov created some of the most influential works of the era, including \"Battleship Potemkin\" (1925), \"Mother\" (1926), and \"Man with a Movie Camera\" (1929). These films showcased the talents of Soviet filmmakers and helped establish the country as a major force in world cinema.\n\nThe 1930s also saw the rise of socialist realism, a literary and artistic movement that emphasized the depiction of everyday life and the struggles of the working class. Filmmakers like Vladimir Petrov and Fridrikh Ermler created films that reflected this ideology, such as \"The Great Turning Point\" (1934) and \"The Return of Maxim\" (1937).\n\n**Late Soviet cinema (1953–1990)**\n\nAfter Stalin's death in 1953, Soviet cinema experienced a period of relaxation, with filmmakers enjoying greater creative freedom. The 1960s and 1970s saw the rise of a new generation of filmmakers, including Andrei Tarkovsky, Sergei Parajanov, and Nikita Mikhalkov. These directors created some of the most influential works of the era, including \"Andrei Rublev\" (1966), \"The Color of Pomegranates\" (1969), and \"The Assassin of the Dawn\" (1979).\n\nThe 1980s saw a resurgence of interest in Soviet cinema, with the release of films like \"Stalker\" (1979), \"The Mirror\" (1975), and \"Repentance\" (1987). These films showcased the talents of Soviet filmmakers and helped establish the country as a major player in world cinema.\n\n**New Russian cinema**\n\nThe collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 marked a new era in Russian cinema. The 1990s saw a period of rapid growth and innovation, with the rise of a new generation of filmmakers. These directors created some of the most influential works of the era, including \"Martin's Midnight Confessions\" (1994), \"The Barber of Siberia\" (1998), and \"The House of Fools\" (1997).\n\n**1990s**\n\nThe 1990s saw the rise of a new generation of filmmakers, including Nikita Mikhalkov, Oleg Pogodin, and Alexander Sokurov. These directors created some of the most influential works of the era, including \"The Barber of Siberia\" (1998), \"Martin's Midnight Confessions\" (1994), and \"The Days of the Turbins\" (1997).\n\nThe 1990s also saw the establishment of new film studios, including the Lenfilm studio in St. Petersburg and the Mosfilm studio in Moscow. These studios produced a wide range of films, including historical dramas, comedies, and documentaries.\n\n**2000s**\n\nThe 2000s saw a continued growth in Russian cinema, with the rise of a new generation of filmmakers. These directors created some of the most influential works of the era, including \"The Return\" (2003), \"The Banishment\" (2007), and \"The Edge\" (2009).\n\nThe 2000s also saw the establishment of new film festivals, including the Moscow International Film Festival and the St. Petersburg International Film Festival. These festivals showcased the talents of Russian filmmakers and helped establish the country as a major player in world cinema.\n\n**2010s**\n\nThe 2010s saw a continued growth in Russian cinema, with the rise of a new generation of filmmakers. These directors created some of the most influential works of the era, including \"Leviathan\" (2014), \"The Method\" (2015), and \"The Front Line\" (2016).\n\nThe 2010s also saw the establishment of new film studios, including the Central Partnership studio in Moscow. These studios produced a wide range of films, including historical dramas, comedies, and documentaries.\n\n**2020s**\n\nThe 2020s have seen a continued growth in Russian cinema, with the rise of a new generation of filmmakers. These directors created some of the most influential works of the era, including \"Beanpole\" (2019), \"Atlantis\" (2019), and \"The Man Who Surprised His Wife\" (2020).\n\nThe 2020s have also seen the establishment of new film festivals, including the Moscow International Film Festival and the St. Petersburg International Film Festival. These festivals showcased the talents of Russian filmmakers and helped establish the country as a major player in world cinema.\n\n**2022 boycott**\n\nIn 2022, the Russian film industry faced a boycott from international film festivals and distributors following the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
