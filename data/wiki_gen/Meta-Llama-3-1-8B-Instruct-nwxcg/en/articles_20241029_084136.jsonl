He was a central figure in the intellectual and cultural landscape of late antiquity and is considered one of the most important thinkers of the Middle Ages. Boethius was a master of multiple disciplines, including philosophy, mathematics, music, and theology, and his works had a profound impact on Western thought.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nAnicius Manlius Severinus Boethius was born in 480 CE in Rome, Italy. His family was an ancient and noble one, with connections to the Roman aristocracy. Boethius's father, Flavius Manlius Boethius, was a consul in 487 CE and a prominent figure in Roman politics. Boethius's mother was Symmachus's daughter. Boethius received a traditional Roman education, studying grammar, rhetoric, and law. He also showed a particular interest in philosophy and mathematics, which would become the focus of his later work.\n\n**Rise to Power**\n\nBoethius's early life was marked by his family's influence and connections. He became a senator at a young age and quickly rose through the ranks, holding various positions, including consul in 510 CE. Boethius's rise to power was facilitated by his family's reputation and his own intelligence and charisma. He became a close advisor to King Theodoric the Great, who ruled the Ostrogothic kingdom in Italy. Boethius's influence with Theodoric allowed him to shape the king's policies and promote his own philosophical and literary works.\n\n**Downfall and Death**\n\nBoethius's downfall began when he fell out of favor with King Theodoric. The exact reasons for this are unclear, but it is believed that Boethius's support for the Catholic Church and his criticism of Theodoric's pagan policies may have contributed to his decline. In 523 CE, Boethius was arrested and imprisoned on charges of treason. He was subjected to torture and interrogation, but he refused to confess to any wrongdoing. Despite his protests of innocence, Boethius was eventually convicted and sentenced to death. He was executed on October 23, 524 CE.\n\n**Major Works**\n\nBoethius's works span multiple disciplines and are characterized by their depth and sophistication. Some of his most notable works include:\n\n### **De consolatione philosophiae**\n\nDe consolatione philosophiae (The Consolation of Philosophy) is Boethius's most famous work. It is a philosophical treatise that explores the nature of happiness, fate, and the human condition. The work is written in the form of a dialogue between Boethius and the personification of Philosophy. Boethius argues that true happiness comes not from external sources, but from within, and that it is the result of living a virtuous life.\n\n### **De topicis differentiis**\n\nDe topicis differentiis (On Topical Differences) is a work on logic and rhetoric. It explores the relationship between language and reality, and provides a system for classifying and analyzing arguments. The work is significant because it represents one of the earliest attempts to systematically categorize and evaluate arguments.\n\n### **De arithmetica**\n\nDe arithmetica (On Arithmetic) is a work on mathematics. It covers a range of topics, including numbers, proportions, and geometric shapes. The work is significant because it provides a comprehensive overview of mathematical knowledge at the time.\n\n### **De institutione musica**\n\nDe institutione musica (On the Institution of Music) is a work on music theory. It covers topics such as the nature of sound, the properties of pitch, and the relationship between music and mathematics. The work is significant because it provides a detailed and systematic analysis of musical concepts.\n\n### **Opuscula sacra**\n\nOpuscula sacra (Sacred Works) is a collection of theological and philosophical writings. The work includes treatises on the nature of God, the Trinity, and the relationship between faith and reason.\n\n**Dates of Works**\n\nBoethius's works were composed over a period of several decades. The exact dates of composition are unclear, but it is believed that he wrote:\n\n* De consolatione philosophiae: 523 CE\n* De topicis differentiis: 510-520 CE\n* De arithmetica: 510-520 CE\n* De institutione musica: 510-520 CE\n* Opuscula sacra: 510-524 CE\n\n**Legacy**\n\nBoethius's legacy is profound and far-reaching. His works had a significant impact on Western philosophy, influencing thinkers such as Thomas Aquinas, William of Ockham, and John Duns Scotus. His writings on logic and rhetoric also had a lasting impact on the development of these disciplines. In addition, Boethius's philosophical ideas on the nature of happiness, fate, and the human condition continue to be studied and debated by scholars today.\n\n**Veneration**\n\nBoethius was venerated as a saint in the Catholic Church. His feast day is October 23, which is also the day of his execution. He is considered a patron saint of philosophers, scholars, and musicians.\n\n**In Popular Culture**\n\nBoethius's works have had a significant impact on popular culture. His ideas on the nature of happiness and the human condition have influenced literature, art, and music. His philosophical treatises have been translated into many languages and continue to be studied and debated by scholars today. In addition, Boethius's story has inspired numerous works of fiction, including novels, plays, and films.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Ancient Roman philosophy\n* Medieval philosophy\n* Logic\n* Rhetoric\n* Music theory\n* Theology\n* Catholic Church\n* Patron saints\n\n**Notes**\n\nThis article is a comprehensive overview of Boethius's life and works.

The Shattering, a mysterious phenomenon, is causing time to move at different rates, resulting in strange and unpredictable events.\n\nAs the family tries to make sense of their situation, they begin to realize that time is not the only thing that is collapsing. Their relationships with each other are also beginning to fray, and old wounds are starting to resurface. Lee, who is struggling to come to terms with the loss of his daughter, must confront his own personal demons in order to protect his family.\n\nMeanwhile, Regan, who is deaf, begins to experience strange and unexplained phenomena that seem to be connected to the Shattering.

With a total area of approximately 603,700 square kilometers (233,062 square miles), Ukraine is the second-largest country in Europe by area and has a diverse geography, climate, and culture.\n\n**Etymology and orthography**\n\nThe name \"Ukraine\" is derived from the Old East Slavic word \"ukraina,\" meaning \"edge\" or \"borderland.\" The country's name was officially changed from the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (Ukrainian SSR) to Ukraine on August 24, 1991, after gaining independence from the Soviet Union.\n\nThe Ukrainian alphabet is based on the Cyrillic script and consists of 33 letters. The language is spoken by over 40 million people and is an official language in Ukraine.\n\n**History**\n\n### Early history\n\nThe earliest known human settlements in Ukraine date back to the Paleolithic era, around 250,000 years ago. The region was inhabited by various tribes, including the Cimmerians, Scythians, and Sarmatians. In the 5th century BCE, the Greeks established colonies on the shores of the Black Sea, and the region was later conquered by the Romans.\n\n### Golden Age of Kyiv\n\nIn the 9th century CE, the state of Kievan Rus', founded by Prince Oleg, emerged as a powerful and influential force in Eastern Europe. The Golden Age of Kyiv, which lasted from the 10th to the 13th centuries, saw the construction of magnificent buildings, including the famous St. Sophia Cathedral, and the development of a rich cultural and economic life.\n\n### Foreign domination\n\nIn the 13th century, Kievan Rus' was invaded by the Mongols, and the Golden Horde, a Mongol khanate, ruled over Ukraine for several centuries. In the 14th century, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth conquered Ukraine, and the region became a battleground for various European powers.\n\n### Cossack Hetmanate\n\nIn the 17th century, the Cossack Hetmanate was established, a semi-autonomous state that lasted for over a century. The Cossacks, a group of free warriors, played a significant role in the region's history, fighting against the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Ottoman Empire.\n\n### 19th and early 20th century\n\nIn the 19th century, Ukraine experienced significant cultural and economic growth, with the establishment of the Ukrainian language and literature. However, the region was also subject to Russian rule, and the Ukrainian people faced significant repression and Russification.\n\n### Inter-war period\n\nAfter World War I, Ukraine declared independence, but it was short-lived, as the country was soon occupied by the Soviet Union. The 1920s and 1930s saw the establishment of collectivization, forced industrialization, and the Great F", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Ukraine\" following this outline:\n\n#Etymology and orthography\n#History\n##Early history\n##Golden Age of Kyiv\n##Foreign domination\n##Cossack Hetmanate\n##19th and early 20th century\n##Inter-war period\n##World War II\n##Post–war Soviet Ukraine\n##Independence\n#Geography\n##Climate\n##Biodiversity\n##Urban areas\n#Politics\n##Constitution\n##Government\n##Courts and law enforcement\n##Foreign relations\n##Military\n##Administrative divisions\n#Economy\n##Agriculture\n##Tourism\n##Transport\n##Energy\n##Information technology\n#Demographics\n##Language\n##Diaspora\n##Religion\n##Health\n##Education\n##Regional differences\n#Culture\n##Libraries\n##Literature\n##Architecture\n##Weaving and embroidery\n##Music\n##Media\n##Sport\n##Cuisine\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Print sources\n##Reference books\n##Recent (since 1991)\n##History\n###World War II\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The battle took place from August 2022 to January 2023, with significant implications for the control of the region and the prospects for a broader Ukrainian counteroffensive.\n\n# Background\n\nThe city of Soledar, with a pre-war population of approximately 10,000 residents, is situated in the Donetsk Oblast, a region that has been at the forefront of the conflict since 2014. The city's strategic location, approximately 10 kilometers north of Bakhmut, made it a crucial target for Russian forces seeking to encircle and capture the city. Soledar's industrial infrastructure, including coal mining operations, also made it a valuable prize for the Russian military.\n\n# Battle\n\n## Initial Russian advances (3 August – 1 October 2022)\n\nThe battle began on August 3, 2022, as Russian forces launched a coordinated assault on Soledar, aiming to capture the city and secure a strategic foothold in the region. Ukrainian defenders, who had been preparing for the impending attack, put up a fierce resistance, but the Russian forces managed to make significant gains in the initial stages of the battle. By mid-August, Russian troops had established a foothold in the city, but the fierce fighting that ensued prevented them from making further progress.\n\n## Frontline stalls (2 October – 27 December 2022)\n\nAs the battle raged on, the frontline remained relatively stable, with both sides engaging in intense skirmishes and artillery duels. The Ukrainian defenders, who had received significant reinforcements and supplies, managed to hold their ground and prevent the Russian forces from making further advances. The Russian military, however, continued to suffer heavy casualties, with estimates suggesting that thousands of troops were killed or wounded during this period.\n\n## Russian breakthrough and capture (27 December 2022 – 16 January 2023)\n\nOn December 27, 2022, Russian forces launched a major breakthrough operation, aimed at capturing Soledar and securing a strategic advantage in the region. The Ukrainian defenders, who had been weakened by the prolonged fighting, were unable to withstand the intense Russian onslaught. Over the next few days, Russian troops managed to capture key positions in the city, including the city center and the local government buildings. On January 16, 2023, Russian forces declared the capture of Soledar, marking a significant victory for the Russian military.\n\n# Casualties and humanitarian impact\n\n## Military casualties\n\nThe battle of Soledar resulted in significant military casualties on both sides. Estimates suggest that thousands of Russian troops were killed or wounded during the battle, while Ukrainian forces suffered hundreds of casualties. The exact number of casualties is difficult to determine due to the intense nature of the fighting and the lack of official reports.\n\n## Impact on civilians\n\nThe battle of Soledar had a devastating impact on the city's civilian population. Many residents were forced to flee their homes, seeking safety in nearby towns and cities. Those who remained were exposed to the intense fighting, with many homes and buildings damaged or destroyed. The city's infrastructure, including water and electricity supplies, was severely damaged, leaving residents without basic necessities.\n\n# Analysis\n\nThe battle of Soledar was a significant chapter in the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War, with far-reaching implications for the control of the region and the prospects for a broader Ukrainian counteroffensive. The Russian military's ability to capture the city, despite the fierce resistance from Ukrainian defenders, marked a significant victory for the Russian forces. However, the battle also highlighted the high cost of the conflict, with thousands of soldiers and civilians killed or wounded.\n\nThe battle also had significant strategic implications, with the capture of Soledar providing a strategic foothold for the Russian military in the region. However, the battle also marked a significant setback for the Ukrainian military, which had been seeking to launch a counteroffensive in the region. The loss of Soledar will likely have a significant impact on the Ukrainian military's plans and operations in the coming months.\n\n# See also\n\n* Russo-Ukrainian War\n* Battle of Bakhmut\n* Battle of Izyum\n* Battle of Kharkiv\n* Battle of Mariupol", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Battle_of_Soledar\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Battle\n##Initial Russian advances (3 August – 1 October 2022)\n##Frontline stalls (2 October – 27 December 2022)\n##Russian breakthrough and capture (27 December 2022 – 16 January 2023)\n#Casualties and humanitarian impact\n##Military casualties\n##Impact on civilians\n#Analysis\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The style is named after the Italian architect Andrea Palladio, who wrote extensively on the subject and designed many buildings that exemplified the style.\n\n**Palladio's Architecture**\n\nAndrea Palladio (1508-1580) was a renowned Venetian architect who is considered one of the most influential architects of all time. Born in Vicenza, Italy, Palladio was apprenticed to a local stonemason at a young age and later studied with the renowned architect Giangiorgio Trissino. Palladio's early work was influenced by the classical styles of ancient Greece and Rome, and he drew inspiration from the works of Vitruvius, a Roman architect who wrote extensively on the principles of building design.\n\nPalladio's architecture is characterized by the use of classical elements, such as columns, arches, and domes, in a way that is both elegant and restrained. He was a master of proportion and symmetry, and his buildings often feature a central axis that is flanked by symmetrical wings. Palladio's designs were also influenced by the Italian Renaissance, and he often incorporated elements of medieval architecture, such as vaults and ribbed ceilings.\n\nSome of Palladio's most famous buildings include the Villa Capra, also known as the Villa Rotonda, which is considered one of the greatest buildings of the Renaissance. The villa features a central dome and four identical facades, each of which is flanked by a pair of columns. The villa was designed by Palladio in 1566 and is considered one of the most perfect examples of Palladian architecture.\n\n**Venetian and Palladian Windows**\n\nVenetian and Palladian windows are a type of window that is characteristic of Palladian architecture. These windows feature a combination of small panes of glass that are arranged in a grid pattern, with a central mullion that separates the two sides of the window. The windows are often topped by a decorative cornice, and may feature other decorative elements, such as carvings or moldings.\n\nVenetian and Palladian windows were popularized by Palladio and his contemporaries, who used them to create a sense of light and airiness in their buildings. The windows were often large and unobstructed, allowing natural light to flood into the interior spaces. The use of Venetian and Palladian windows was also a way to create a sense of connection between the interior and exterior spaces of a building.\n\n**Early Palladianism**\n\nEarly Palladianism refers to the period of time during which Palladian architecture was first emerging in the 16th century. During this period, Palladio and his contemporaries were experimenting with new forms and styles of building design, drawing on a wide range of classical and Renaissance influences.\n\nOne of the key characteristics of early Palladianism is the use of classical elements, such as columns, arches, and domes, in a way that is both elegant and restrained. The use of symmetry and proportion was also a key feature of early Palladianism, with many buildings featuring a central axis that is flanked by symmetrical wings.\n\nSome of the most famous examples of early Palladianism include the Villa Foscari, also known as the Villa La Malcontenta, which was designed by Palladio in 1560. The villa features a central axis that is flanked by symmetrical wings, and is topped by a decorative cornice.\n\n**Neo-Palladianism**\n\nNeo-Palladianism refers to the period of time during which Palladian architecture was revived and reinterpreted in the 18th century. During this period, architects such as Robert Adam and James Wyatt drew on the principles of Palladian architecture to create new and innovative designs.\n\nOne of the key characteristics of Neo-Palladianism is the use of classical elements, such as columns, arches, and domes, in a way that is both elegant and restrained. The use of symmetry and proportion was also a key feature of Neo-Palladianism, with many buildings featuring a central axis that is flanked by symmetrical wings.\n\nSome of the most famous examples of Neo-Palladianism include the Holkham Hall, which was designed by William Kent in 1750. The hall features a central axis that is flanked by symmetrical wings, and is topped by a decorative cornice.\n\n**English Palladian Architecture**\n\nEnglish Palladian architecture refers to the style of building design that was popular in England during the 18th century. During this period, architects such as Robert Adam and James Wyatt drew on the principles of Palladian architecture to create new and innovative designs.\n\nOne of the key characteristics of English Palladian architecture is the use of classical elements, such as columns, arches, and domes, in a way that is both elegant and restrained. The use of symmetry and proportion was also a key feature of English Palladian architecture, with many buildings featuring a central axis that is flanked by symmetrical wings.\n\nSome of the most famous examples of English Palladian architecture include the Chiswick House, which was designed by William Kent in 1725. The house features a central axis that is flanked by symmetrical wings, and is topped by a decorative cornice.\n\n**Irish Palladian Architecture**\n\nIrish Palladian architecture refers to the style of building design that was popular in Ireland during the 18th century. During this period, architects such as Richard Castle and Francis Johnston drew on the principles of Palladian architecture to create new and innovative designs.\n\nOne of the key characteristics of Irish Palladian architecture is the use of classical elements, such as columns, arches, and domes, in a way that is both elegant and restrained. The use of symmetry and proportion was also a key feature of Irish Palladian architecture, with many buildings featuring a central axis that is flanked by symmetrical wings.\n\nSome of the most famous examples of Irish Palladian architecture include the Castletown House, which was designed by James Hoban in 1722. The house features a central axis that is flanked by symmetrical wings, and is topped by a decorative cornice.\n\n**North American Palladian Architecture**\n\nNorth American Palladian architecture refers to the style of building design that was popular in North America during the 18th century. During this period, architects such as Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin H. Latrobe drew on the principles of Palladian architecture to create new and innovative designs.\n\nOne of the key characteristics of North American Palladian architecture is the use of classical elements, such as columns, arches, and domes, in a way that is both elegant and restrained. The use of symmetry and proportion was also a key feature of North American Palladian architecture, with many buildings featuring a central axis that is flanked by symmetrical wings.\n\nSome of the most famous examples of North American Palladian architecture include the Monticello, which was designed by Thomas Jefferson in 1772. The house features a central axis that is flanked by symmetrical wings, and is topped by a decorative cornice.\n\n**Palladianism Elsewhere**\n\nPalladianism was not limited to Europe and North America, and was also popular in other parts of the world. In Australia, for example, Palladian architecture was used in the design of many buildings, including the Government House in Sydney.\n\nIn Asia, Palladianism was influenced by the colonial powers that established trade relationships with the region. In India, for example, Palladian architecture was used in the design of many buildings, including the Government House in Calcutta.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nPalladian architecture has had a lasting impact on the development of building design.

The club was founded in 1889 and has a long and storied history in English football. The team currently plays in the National League South, the sixth tier of the English football league system.\n\n# History\n## Formation and early years (1889–1925)\n\nBath City was founded in 1889 as a result of a merger between two local football clubs, Clarence and Oddfellows. The team played their early years in various amateur leagues, including the Western League and the Southern League. In the early 20th century, the club began to gain recognition and attention, with crowds of over 10,000 attending matches at the team's home ground, the North Parade Ground.\n\n## Large crowds and missing out on Football League (1925–1958)\n\nThe 1920s and 1930s were a period of significant growth and success for Bath City. The team's crowds began to swell, with over 20,000 attending matches at the North Parade Ground. However, despite this success, the team was unable to gain promotion to the Football League, which was the highest level of English football at the time. This period also saw the team change home grounds, moving from the North Parade Ground to Belvoir Castle in 1900.\n\n## Glory, yoyo years and nationwide football (1958–1996)\n\nThe 1950s and 1960s were a period of great success for Bath City. The team won the Southern League championship in 1958 and gained promotion to the Football League for the first time in their history. However, the team's stay in the Football League was short-lived, and they were relegated back to the Southern League in 1960. This period also saw the team change home grounds again, moving from Belvoir Castle to Lambridge in 1919.\n\n## Decline and subsequent relegation (1996–2017)\n\nThe 1990s and 2000s were a period of decline for Bath City. The team struggled financially and on the pitch, and were relegated from the Conference National to the Conference South in 1996. Despite some success in the late 1990s and early 2000s, the team continued to struggle, and were relegated to the Southern League in 2015.\n\n## The Gill Era (2017–present)\n\nIn 2017, Bath City appointed Martin Glynn as manager. Under Glynn's leadership, the team has shown significant improvement, finishing third in the Southern League in 2018 and gaining promotion to the National League South. The team has continued to improve under Glynn's leadership, and are currently competing in the National League South.\n\n# Badge\n\nThe Bath City badge is a blue and white shield with a gold crown on top. The shield features a blue and white chevron pattern, with the club's initials \"BCFC\" in gold. The badge has undergone several changes since the club's formation, but the current design has been in use since 2017.\n\n# Stadiums\n\n## 1889: The North Parade Ground\n\nThe North Parade Ground was the first home ground of Bath City, and was located in the city centre. The ground was a flat, open space with a small stand and a few goals. The ground was used by the team from 1889 to 1900, and was known for its large crowds and lively atmosphere.\n\n## 1900–1919: Belvoir Castle\n\nBelvoir Castle was the second home ground of Bath City, and was located on a hill overlooking the city. The ground was a more modern facility than the North Parade Ground, with a larger stand and better facilities. The ground was used by the team from 1900 to 1919, and was known for its stunning views of the city.\n\n## 1919–1932: Lambridge\n\nLambridge was the third home ground of Bath City, and was located on the outskirts of the city. The ground was a more rural facility than the previous two grounds, with a small stand and a few goals. The ground was used by the team from 1919 to 1932, and was known for its peaceful atmosphere.\n\n## 1932–present: Twerton Park\n\nTwerton Park is the current home ground of Bath City, and has been in use since 1932. The ground is a modern facility with a large stand and good facilities. The ground has undergone several renovations since its opening, including the addition of a new stand and improved floodlights. Twerton Park is known for its lively atmosphere and is a popular destination for fans of the team.\n\n# Support\n\nBath City has a dedicated and loyal fan base, with a large following of supporters who attend matches and follow the team's progress.

He was the eldest son of King Paul and Queen Frederica, and the grandson of King George II and Queen Elizabeth of Greece.\n\n**Early Life**\n\n### World War II and the exile of the royal family\n\nDuring World War II, the Greek royal family was forced into exile by the German occupation of Greece. King George II and Queen Elizabeth fled to Egypt in 1941, where they established a government-in-exile. Constantine II was born in the Mount Vernon Hotel in Alexandria, Egypt, in 1940. The royal family spent the remainder of the war in exile, returning to Greece in 1946.\n\n### After World War II and return to Greece\n\nAfter the war, Constantine II's family returned to Greece, where his father, King Paul, ascended to the throne in 1947. Constantine II's early life was marked by a series of education and travel, as his family sought to establish a stable and secure future for Greece. Constantine II was educated in England and later at the University of Athens.\n\n**Crown Prince**\n\n### Education\n\nConstantine II's education was a mixture of traditional and modern studies. He studied at the University of Athens, where he earned a degree in law and economics. He also studied at the Royal Military College at Sandhurst in England, where he earned a commission as a second lieutenant in the British Army.\n\n### Sailing and the Olympic Games\n\nConstantine II was an avid sailor and competed in the Olympic Games in 1960. He sailed on the Greek Olympic yachting team and finished in fifth place. His love of sailing and the sea was a lifelong passion, and he often spent his free time sailing in the Mediterranean.\n\n**Reign**\n\n### Accession and marriage\n\nConstantine II ascended to the throne in 1964, following the death of his father, King Paul. He was just 24 years old at the time. He married Anne-Marie of Denmark in 1964, and the couple had three children: Alexia, Pavlos, and Nikolaos.\n\n### Apostasia of 1965\n\nIn 1965, Constantine II's government was challenged by a group of military officers who opposed his marriage to a non-Greek. The officers, led by General Georgios Papadopoulos, staged a coup, but it was unsuccessful. Constantine II's government survived the challenge, but the incident marked the beginning of a period of increasing instability in Greece.\n\n### Greek dictatorship of 1967–1974\n\nIn 1967, a group of military officers led by General Papadopoulos staged a successful coup, and Constantine II was forced into exile. The Greek dictatorship was established, and Greece remained under military rule until 1974.\n\n### Royal countercoup of 13 December 1967 and exile\n\nOn 13 December 1967, Constantine II attempted to stage a countercoup against the military government, but it was unsuccessful. He was forced to flee Greece and establish a government-in-exile in Italy.\n\n**Restoration of democracy and the referendum**\n\nIn 1974, Constantine II's government-in-exile was re-established in Greece, and a referendum was held in which the Greek people voted to become a republic. Constantine II's family returned to Greece, but he was forced to renounce his claim to the throne.\n\n**Life in exile after 1974**\n\n### Abortive conspiracies\n\nConstantine II's life in exile was marked by several abortive conspiracies and plots to restore the monarchy. In 1979, a group of Greek military officers attempted to stage a coup, but it was unsuccessful. Constantine II's family was forced to flee Greece again.\n\n### 1993 visit to Greece\n\nIn 1993, Constantine II returned to Greece for a visit, but it was not a triumphant return. The Greek government refused to allow him to visit the tomb of his father, King Paul, and he was forced to leave the country.\n\n### Legal quarrels over the royal properties\n\nConstantine II spent many years in exile, and during that time, he was involved in several legal quarrels over the royal properties. In 2012, the Greek government seized the royal properties, and Constantine II was forced to sell his assets.\n\n**Later Life**\n\n### Death\n\nConstantine II died on 10 January 2023, at the age of 82. He was buried in the family tomb in Tatoi, Greece.\n\n**Issue**\n\nConstantine II's children are:\n\n* Alexia of Greece (born 1965)\n* Pavlos of Greece (born 1967)\n* Nikolaos of Greece (born 1969)\n\n**Ancestry**\n\nConstantine II's ancestry is as follows:\n\n* Father: King Paul of Greece\n* Mother: Queen Frederica of Greece\n* Grandfather: King George II of Greece\n* Grandmother: Queen Elizabeth of Greece\n\n**Titles, styles and honours**\n\n### Titles and styles\n\n* 6 June 1940 – 1 March 1946: His Royal Highness Prince Constantine of Greece\n* 1 March 1946 – 6 March 1947: His Royal Highness The Crown Prince of Greece\n* 6 March 1947 – 6 March 1964: His Royal Highness The Crown Prince of Greece and Prince of Denmark\n* 6 March 1964 – 1 June 1973: His Majesty King Constantine II of the Hellenes\n\n### National honours\n\n* Grand Master of the Order of the Redeemer\n* Grand Master of the Order of the Saviour\n* Grand Master of the Order of the Beneficent Benefactor\n* Grand Master of the Order of the Phoenix\n\n### Foreign honours\n\n* Knight Grand Cross with Collar of the Order of the White Rose of Finland\n* Knight Grand Cordon with Collar of the Order of the Chrysanthemum of Japan\n* Knight Grand Cross with Collar of the Order of the Dannebrog of Denmark\n* Knight Grand Cross with Collar of the Order of the Three Stars of Latvia\n* Knight Grand Cross with Collar of the Order of the Golden Ark of the Netherlands\n\n**Awards**\n\n* Olympic diploma in sailing (1960)\n* Grand Cross of the Order of the White Rose of Finland (1960)\n* Grand Cordon with Collar of the Order of the Chrysanthemum of Japan (1963)\n* Knight Grand Cordon with Collar of the Order of the Dannebrog of Denmark (1964)\n* Knight Grand Cross with Collar of the Order of the Three Stars of Latvia (1966)\n* Knight Grand Cross with Collar of the Order of the Golden Ark of the Netherlands (1967)\n\n**See also**\n\n* List of monarchs of Greece\n* Greek royal family\n* Royal family of Greece\n\n**References**\n\n* \"Constantine II, King of Greece\".

It is a crucial aspect of predator-prey dynamics and is influenced by various factors, including the predator's behavior, environmental conditions, and prey characteristics.\n\n**Definition**\n\nHunting success is often measured as the number of successful hunts divided by the total number of attempts, typically expressed as a percentage. It can be calculated for individual predators, populations, or even species. For example, a predator with a 50% hunting success rate would successfully hunt half of the animals it encounters.\n\n**Hunting Success in Animals**\n\nHunting success varies greatly among different animal species, with some predators exhibiting extremely high success rates. Here are some examples of animals by their hunting success rate:\n\n* **List of Animals by Hunting Success Rate**\n\t+ Lion: 15-20%\n\t+ Leopard: 10-15%\n\t+ Jaguar: 20-30%\n\t+ Cheetah: 50-60%\n\t+ Wild dog: 60-70%\n\t+ Spotted hyena: 80-90%\n\t+ Great white shark: 10-20% (inshore), 50-60% (open ocean)\n* **Reasons for High Hunting Success**\n\t+ Evolutionary adaptation: Some predators have evolved specific traits, such as speed, agility, or powerful senses, that enable them to excel at hunting.\n\t+ Specialized hunting techniques: Animals like wild dogs and spotted hyenas have developed complex social hunting strategies that increase their success rates.\n\t+ Environmental factors: Predators that live in areas with high prey densities or limited vegetation cover tend to have higher success rates.\n\n**Kill Rates**\n\nKill rates refer to the number of animals killed by a predator in a given time period. It is an important metric for understanding hunting success, as it takes into account the number of successful hunts as well as the time it takes to make them. Kill rates can be influenced by various factors, including:\n\n* **Selective Feeding**\n\t+ Predators may focus on specific prey species, which can affect their kill rates.\n\t+ Some predators are opportunistic feeders, taking advantage of whatever prey is available.\n* **Social and Solitary Predators**\n\t+ Social predators, like wolves and lions, often work together to hunt and kill prey.\n\t+ Solitary predators, like leopards and jaguars, hunt alone and may have lower kill rates due to increased competition for food.\n* **Hunting Methods**\n\t+ Predators that use ambush tactics, like snakes and great white sharks, may have higher kill rates than those that actively pursue prey.\n\t+ Hunting methods, such as stalking or chasing, can also affect kill rates.\n* **Environmental Influences**\n\t+ Vegetation cover, terrain, and climate can all impact a predator's ability to hunt and kill prey.\n\t+ Environmental factors can also influence prey behavior, making it easier or harder for predators to hunt.\n\n**Factors Influencing Success**\n\nSeveral factors can influence a predator's hunting success, including:\n\n* **Vegetative Cover**\n\t+ Predators that live in areas with dense vegetation cover, like forests or grasslands, may have lower success rates due to reduced visibility and increased effort required to hunt.\n\t+ Open habitats, like savannas or deserts, can provide better hunting opportunities for some predators.\n* **Seasonal Variations**\n\t+ Changes in prey population sizes, behavior, or distribution due to seasonal variations can affect hunting success.\n\t+ Some predators may adapt to seasonal changes by modifying their hunting strategies or exploiting alternative prey sources.\n\n**In Human Hunters**\n\nHuman hunting success is influenced by various factors, including:\n\n* **Hunting Success in Humans**\n\t+ Experienced hunters tend to have higher success rates due to improved skills and knowledge.\n\t+ Hunting methods, such as archery or firearms, can affect success rates.\n* **Factors Influencing Success of Human Hunters**\n\t+ Environmental conditions, like weather and terrain, can impact hunting success.\n\t+ Prey behavior and distribution can also influence hunting success.\n* **Hunting Types and Methods**\n\t+ Different hunting types, such as big game hunting or waterfowl hunting, require specific skills and tactics.\n\t+ Hunting methods, like stalking or driving, can also affect success rates.\n* **Impact**\n\t+ Hunting success can have significant impacts on prey populations, ecosystems, and human communities.\n\t+ Understanding hunting success is crucial for managing and conserving wildlife populations and ecosystems.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Predator-prey dynamics\n* Hunting behavior\n* Wildlife management\n* Conservation biology\n* Ecological research", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Hunting_success\" following this outline:\n\n#Definition\n#Hunting success in animals\n##List of animals by hunting success rate\n##Reasons for high hunting success\n#Kill rates\n#Factors influencing success\n##Selective feeding\n##Social and solitary predators\n##Hunting methods\n##Environmental influences\n##Vegetative cover\n#In human hunters\n##Hunting success in humans\n##Factors influencing success of human hunters\n##Hunting types and methods\n##Impact\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The talks were seen as a key opportunity for the two sides to reach a resolution, but progress was slow. The WGA also reported that it had received significant support from the public, with many fans and industry professionals expressing solidarity with the striking writers.\n\n### October 2023\n\nThroughout October, the WGA continued to negotiate with the AMPTP, but a resolution remained elusive. The strike had a significant impact on the entertainment industry, with many productions delayed or put on hold. The WGA also began to explore alternative forms of content creation, including podcasts and online content.\n\n**WGA negotiating committee**\n\nThe WGA negotiating committee, led by WGA President Meredith Stiehm, played a key role in negotiating with the AMPTP.

Crosby has had a successful career spanning over six decades, with numerous chart-topping hits and critically acclaimed albums.\n\nEarly years\n-----------\n\nDavid Van Cortlandt Crosby was born on August 14, 1941, in Los Angeles, California. His mother, Aliph van Kleeck, was a high school teacher, and his father, Floyd Crosby, was a cinematographer who won an Academy Award for Best Cinematography for his work on the 1935 film \"Tabu.\" Crosby's early life was marked by a love for music, particularly folk and rock music, which would later influence his own musical style.\n\nMusical career\n-------------\n\n### The Byrds\n\nIn 1964, Crosby joined the Byrds, a folk rock band that had recently formed in Los Angeles. The band's original lineup consisted of Roger McGuinn, Gene Clark, Michael Clarke, and Crosby. With Crosby on board, the Byrds achieved significant commercial success, releasing several hit singles and albums, including \"Mr. Tambourine Man,\" \"Turn! Turn! Turn!,\" and \"Eight Miles High.\" Crosby's distinctive vocals and songwriting skills were a key factor in the Byrds' success.\n\n### Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young\n\nIn 1968, Crosby, along with Stephen Stills and Graham Nash, formed the supergroup Crosby, Stills & Nash (CSN). Later that year, Neil Young joined the group, and they became Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young (CSNY). CSNY released several critically acclaimed albums, including \"Déjà Vu\" and \"4 Way Street,\" which featured hits like \"Suite: Judy Blue Eyes,\" \"Guinnevere,\" and \"Wooden Ships.\" CSNY's music was characterized by its harmonious vocals and socially conscious lyrics.\n\n### 1971–2022: Solo career and Crosby & Nash\n\nAfter CSNY disbanded in the early 1970s, Crosby began a successful solo career, releasing several albums, including \"If I Could Only Remember My Name,\" \"Crosby & Nash,\" and \"Sky Trails.\" In the 1970s and 1980s, Crosby also formed the band Crosby & Nash, which released several albums, including \"Whistledown Wind\" and \"Daylight Again.\" Crosby's solo work was marked by his unique blend of folk, rock, and pop influences.\n\n### 1996–2004: CPR\n\nIn 1996, Crosby, along with Stephen Stills and James Raymond, formed the band CPR, which released the album \"CPR.\" The band's music was characterized by its blend of folk, rock, and pop influences, with Crosby's distinctive vocals and songwriting skills at the forefront.\n\nPersonal life and death\n----------------------\n\n### Family\n\nCrosby has been married four times: to Cameron Macneil, Eileen Botnick, Jan Dance, and Robin Laing. He has three children, James Raymond, Donovan Crosby, and Django Crosby. Crosby's children have been involved in his music career, with James Raymond serving as his drummer and Donovan Crosby contributing vocals to several of his albums.\n\n### Cannabis brand\n\nIn 2019, Crosby launched his own cannabis brand, \"Crosby's Cannabis,\" which offers a range of cannabis products, including flowers, concentrates, and edibles. Crosby has been an advocate for the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes and has used his platform to raise awareness about the benefits of cannabis.\n\n### Sailing\n\nCrosby is an avid sailor and has spent much of his life sailing on his boat, the \"Mayan Fjord.\" He has written about his sailing experiences in several of his songs, including \"Wooden Ships\" and \"Guinnevere.\"\n\n### Politics\n\nCrosby has been involved in various political causes throughout his career, including the anti-war movement and the civil rights movement. In the 1960s and 1970s, Crosby was a vocal critic of the Vietnam War and was involved in several anti-war protests.\n\n### Acting career\n\nCrosby has appeared in several films and television shows, including \"The Doors,\" \"Almost Famous,\" and \"Shut Up & Sing.\" He has also appeared in several documentaries, including \"The 400 Blows\" and \"Woodstock: 3 Days of Peace & Music.\"\n\n### Drugs, alcohol, and arrests\n\nCrosby has struggled with addiction to drugs and alcohol throughout his career, including a highly publicized arrest in 1982 for cocaine possession. He has spoken publicly about his struggles with addiction and has used his platform to raise awareness about the dangers of substance abuse.\n\n### Health issues and death\n\nIn 2022, Crosby announced that he had been diagnosed with a serious health condition and was undergoing treatment. He died on January 18, 2023, at the age of 81, surrounded by his family.\n\nDiscography\n-----------\n\n### Les Baxter's Balladeers\n\n* Les Baxter's Balladeers (1957) - vocals on \"Moon of Manakoora\"\n\n### Studio albums\n\n* If I Could Only Remember My Name (1971)\n* If Only I Could Remember My Name (1971)\n* If I Could Only Remember My Name (1972)\n* If I Could Only Remember My Name (1973)\n* If I Could Only Remember My Name (1974)\n* If I Could Only Remember My Name (1975)\n* If I Could Only Remember My Name (1976)\n* If I Could Only Remember My Name (1977)\n* If I Could Only Remember My Name (1978)\n* If I Could Only Remember My Name (1979)\n* If I Could Only Remember My Name (1980)\n* If I Could Only Remember My Name (1981)\n* If I Could Only Remember My Name (1982)\n* If I Could Only Remember My Name (1983)\n* If I Could Only Remember My Name (1984)\n* If I Could Only Remember My Name (1985)\n* If I Could Only Remember My Name (1986)\n* If I Could Only Remember My Name (1987)\n* If I Could Only Remember My Name (1988)\n* If I Could Only Remember My Name (1989)\n* If I Could Only Remember My Name (1990)\n* If I Could Only Remember My Name (1991)\n* If I Could Only Remember My Name (1992)\n* If I Could Only Remember My Name (1993)\n* If I Could Only Remember My Name (1994)\n* If I Could Only Remember My Name (1995)\n* If I Could Only Remember My Name (1996)\n* If I Could Only Remember My Name (1997)\n* If I Could Only Remember My Name (1998)\n* If I Could Only Remember My Name (1999)\n* If I Could Only Remember My Name (2000)\n* If I Could Only Remember My Name (2001)\n* If I Could Only Remember My Name (2002)\n* If I Could Only Remember My Name (2003)\n* If I Could Only Remember My Name (2004)\n* If I Could Only Remember My Name (2005)\n* If I Could Only Remember My Name (2006)\n* If I Could Only Remember My Name (2007)\n* If I Could Only Remember My Name (2008)\n* If I Could Only Remember My Name (2009)\n* If I Could Only Remember My Name (2010)\n* If I Could Only Remember My Name (2011)\n* If I Could Only Remember My Name (2012)\n* If I Could Only Remember My Name (2013)\n* If I Could Only Remember My Name (2014)\n* If I Could Only Remember My Name (2015)\n* If I Could Only Remember My Name (2016)\n* If I Could Only Remember My Name (2017)\n* If I Could Only Remember My Name (2018)\n* If I Could Only Remember My Name (2019)\n* If I Could Only Remember My Name (2020)\n* If I Could Only Remember My Name (2021)\n* If I Could Only Remember My Name (2022)\n* Sky Trails (2016)\n* Lighthouse (2017)\n* For Free (2018)\n* Here If You Listen (2021)\n\n### Other solo albums\n\n* If I Could Only Remember My Name (1971) -

The film is a spin-off of the Toy Story franchise and is directed by Angus MacLane, with a screenplay by Pete Docter, MacLane, and Keith Petersen. The film follows the origin story of Buzz Lightyear, the space ranger action figure who has been a central character in the Toy Story franchise.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film is set in the year 2525 and follows the story of Buzz Lightyear, a space ranger who is on a mission to stop an Evil Emperor Zurg from destroying the galaxy. During a mission to a planet called Star Command, Lightyear's ship, the Star Command Space Ranger, is damaged in a battle with Zurg's forces. Lightyear is forced to make an emergency landing on a desert planet, where he crash-lands and is presumed dead.\n\nHowever, Lightyear soon discovers that he is not alone on the planet. He meets a group of friendly aliens, including a young girl named Sox, who befriends Lightyear and helps him on his journey. As they travel across the planet, Lightyear and Sox encounter various obstacles, including treacherous terrain, hostile creatures, and Zurg's forces.\n\nThroughout their journey, Lightyear and Sox learn valuable lessons about friendship, teamwork, and the importance of never giving up. Along the way, they also encounter other characters, including a group of space rangers who become allies in their mission to stop Zurg.\n\n**Voice cast**\n\nThe film features a talented voice cast, including:\n\n* Chris Evans as the voice of Buzz Lightyear\n* Keke Palmer as the voice of Sox\n* Peter Sohn as the voice of Mo Morrison\n* Uzo Aduba as the voice of Alisha Hawthorne\n* Dale Soules as the voice of Yori\n* Mary McDonald-Lewis as the voice of Mo Morrison (additional voice)\n* Isiah Whitlock Jr. as the voice of Darby Steel\n* Efren Ramirez as the voice of Vic\n* James Brolin as the voice of Emperor Zurg\n\n**Production**\n\n### Development\n\nThe idea for a Buzz Lightyear spin-off film was first conceived by Pixar Animation Studios in the early 2000s. However, the project was put on hold due to the success of the Toy Story franchise and the studio's focus on other projects. In 2017, Pixar announced that a Buzz Lightyear film was in development, with Angus MacLane set to direct and Pete Docter serving as an executive producer. The film's script was written by MacLane, Docter, and Keith Petersen.\n\n### Casting\n\nThe voice cast for the film was announced in 2020, with Chris Evans confirmed as the voice of Buzz Lightyear. Keke Palmer was also cast as the voice of Sox, a character who would become a central figure in the film.\n\n### Animation and design\n\nThe film's animation and design were handled by a team of artists and technicians at Pixar Animation Studios. The film's visual style was inspired by classic science fiction films, including Star Wars and Star Trek. The team used a combination of computer-generated imagery and practical effects to create the film's characters and environments.\n\n**Music**\n\nThe film's score was composed by Michael Giacchino, who is known for his work on Pixar films such as Up and Inside Out. The score incorporates a mix of electronic and orchestral elements, with a focus on percussion and synthesizers.\n\n**Marketing**\n\nThe film's marketing campaign was launched in 2021, with a series of trailers and promotional materials released by Disney. The campaign focused on the film's action-packed sequences and the voice cast, including Chris Evans and Keke Palmer.\n\n**Release**\n\n### Theatrical\n\nThe film was released in theaters on June 17, 2022. The film received a wide release, with over 4,000 screens in the United States and Canada.\n\n### Ban and censorship\n\nIn some countries, the film was banned or censored due to its depiction of violence and mature themes. In China, the film was banned due to its depiction of space rangers and the Emperor Zurg's forces.\n\n### Home media\n\nThe film was released on digital platforms on September 7, 2022, and on DVD and Blu-ray on October 4, 2022.\n\n**Reception**\n\n### Streaming viewership\n\nThe film was a major success on streaming platforms, with over 100 million viewers in its first week of release. The film's success on streaming platforms was seen as a major factor in its box office success.\n\n### Box office\n\nThe film grossed over $225 million worldwide, with over $100 million of that coming from the United States and Canada. The film's success at the box office was seen as a major factor in its overall success.\n\n### Critical response\n\nThe film received generally positive reviews from critics, with many praising the voice cast, animation, and action sequences. However, some critics felt that the film's story was predictable and that the pacing was too fast.\n\n### Accolades\n\nThe film received several awards and nominations, including:\n\n* Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films nomination for Best Visual Effects\n* Annie Award nomination for Best Animated Feature\n* Critics' Choice Movie Award nomination for Best Animated Feature\n\n**See also**\n\n* Toy Story\n* Buzz Lightyear\n* Space Ranger\n* Pixar Animation Studios\n* Walt Disney Pictures\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The film's script was written by Pete Docter, Angus MacLane, and Keith Petersen.\n* The film's animation and design were handled by a team of artists and technicians at Pixar Animation Studios.\n* The film's score was composed by Michael Giacchino.\n\n**References**\n\n(Note: This article does not include any citations or references, as per your request.)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Lightyear_(film)\" following this outline:\n\n#Plot\n#Voice cast\n#Production\n##Development\n##Casting\n##Animation and design\n#Music\n#Marketing\n#Release\n##Theatrical\n##Ban and censorship\n##Home media\n#Reception\n##Streaming viewership\n##Box office\n##Critical response\n##Accolades\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

This period saw the decline of the Crusader states and the rise of new powers in the region. The chronology of this period is marked by significant events, both military and diplomatic, that shaped the fate of the Crusades.\n\n# **Chronologies of the Crusades in print**\n\nThe chronology of the Later Crusades is well-documented in various historical sources, including medieval chronicles, papal registers, and royal archives. Some notable works that provide valuable information on this period include the _Chronicle of the Templars_, _The History of the Crusades_ by William of Tyre, and the _Chronicle of the Franciscans_. These sources offer a wealth of information on the events, battles, and diplomatic endeavors of the Later Crusades.\n\n# **13th century**\n\n## **Prior events**\n\nThe Later Crusades were preceded by a series of significant events that laid the groundwork for the conflicts of the 13th century. The Fourth Crusade, which took place from 1202 to 1204, had led to the establishment of the Latin Empire in Constantinople, a move that had alienated the Greek Orthodox Church and the Byzantine Empire. The Fifth Crusade, launched in 1213, had ended in failure, and the Sixth Crusade, which took place from 1228 to 1229, had resulted in the temporary capture of Jerusalem by the Crusaders.\n\n## **1270**\n\nIn 1270, the Seventh Crusade was launched by King Louis IX of France, who had recently converted to the Dominican order. The Crusade was aimed at recapturing Jerusalem and the Holy Land from the Mamluk Sultanate. However, the Crusade was met with disaster, and King Louis IX died in 1270, leaving the Crusade without a leader.\n\n## **1280**\n\nIn the early 1280s, the Mamluk Sultanate, under the leadership of Sultan Qalawun, launched a series of campaigns against the Crusader states. The Crusaders, led by King Henry II of Cyprus, were unable to withstand the Mamluk attacks, and in 1287, the Crusaders were defeated at the Battle of Homs.\n\n## **1290**\n\nIn 1290, the Ninth Crusade was launched by King Edward I of England, who had recently returned from the Eighth Crusade. However, the Crusade was short-lived, and Edward I was forced to return to England due to the death of his wife, Queen Eleanor.\n\n# **14th century**\n\n## **1300**\n\nIn the early 1300s, the Crusader states were facing significant challenges from the Mamluk Sultanate. In 1303, the Crusaders were defeated at the Battle of Gaza, and in 1306, the Mamluks captured the city of Acre, the last Crusader stronghold in the Holy Land.\n\n## **1310**\n\nIn the early 1310s, the Crusaders, led by King Louis X of France, launched a series of campaigns against the Mamluk Sultanate. However, the Crusades were unsuccessful, and the Crusaders were forced to retreat back to Cyprus.\n\n## **1320**\n\nIn the 1320s, the Mamluk Sultanate, under the leadership of Sultan al-Nasir Muhammad, launched a series of campaigns against the Christian kingdoms of Europe. The Crusaders, led by King Philip VI of France, were unable to withstand the Mamluk attacks, and in 1326, the Crusaders were defeated at the Battle of Abū al-Uyūn.\n\n## **1330**\n\nIn the early 1330s, the Crusaders, led by King Edward III of England, launched a series of campaigns against the Mamluk Sultanate. However, the Crusades were unsuccessful, and the Crusaders were forced to retreat back to Cyprus.\n\n## **1340**\n\nIn the 1340s, the Black Death, a pandemic that swept through Europe, had a devastating impact on the Crusader states. The pandemic led to significant losses in manpower and economic resources, making it even more difficult for the Crusaders to launch effective campaigns against the Mamluk Sultanate.\n\n## **1350**\n\nIn the 1350s, the Crusader states were facing significant challenges from the Mamluk Sultanate. In 1351, the Crusaders were defeated at the Battle of Wadi al-Khaznadar, and in 1357, the Mamluks captured the city of Antioch, a key Crusader stronghold.\n\n## **1360**\n\nIn the 1360s, the Crusaders, led by King Urban V of France, launched a series of campaigns against the Mamluk Sultanate. However, the Crusades were unsuccessful, and the Crusaders were forced to retreat back to Cyprus.\n\n## **1370**\n\nIn the early 1370s, the Crusaders, led by King Charles V of France, launched a series of campaigns against the Mamluk Sultanate. However, the Crusades were unsuccessful, and the Crusaders were forced to retreat back to Cyprus.\n\n## **1380**\n\nIn the 1380s, the Crusader states were facing significant challenges from the Mamluk Sultanate. In 1380, the Crusaders were defeated at the Battle of Baghras, and in 1386, the Mamluks captured the city of Latakia, a key Crusader stronghold.\n\n## **1390**\n\nIn the 1390s, the Crusaders, led by King Charles VI of France, launched a series of campaigns against the Mamluk Sultanate.

The event, which took place from September 12 to 19, 2022, was a significant moment in British history and a testament to the enduring popularity and respect for the Monarchy.\n\nPrecedents\n\nThe lying-in-state of a British monarch is a centuries-old tradition that allows the public to pay their respects to the deceased monarch before their funeral. This tradition dates back to the 14th century, when King Edward I was the first monarch to lie-in-state. Over the centuries, the tradition has been observed for many monarchs, including Queen Victoria, King George V, and Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nThe queue for the lying-in-state of Elizabeth II was the longest in British history, with an estimated 750,000 people waiting in line over the course of the nine-day event. The queue was so long that it extended from Westminster Hall to the Tower of London, a distance of over 3 miles.\n\nRoutes\n\nThe queue for the lying-in-state of Elizabeth II was organized into two main routes: the main queue and the accessible queue.\n\nMain Queue\n\nThe main queue was the longest of the two and wound its way through the streets of central London, passing by some of the city's most iconic landmarks, including the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben. The queue was divided into sections, with each section allocated a specific waiting time. People in the main queue waited an average of 24 hours to pass through the queue.\n\nAccessible Queue\n\nThe accessible queue was designed for people with disabilities and those who required special assistance. The queue was shorter than the main queue and was located near Westminster Hall. People in the accessible queue waited an average of 12 hours to pass through the queue.\n\nLength\n\nThe total length of the queue for the lying-in-state of Elizabeth II was estimated to be over 10 miles. The queue was so long that it required a team of organizers to manage and coordinate the flow of people.\n\nOrganization\n\nThe queue for the lying-in-state of Elizabeth II was a massive undertaking that required the coordination of hundreds of staff and volunteers. The event was organized by the Royal Family, the British government, and a team of event organizers.\n\nExemptions from Queuing\n\nThere were several exemptions from queuing for the lying-in-state of Elizabeth II, including:\n\n* Members of the Royal Family\n* Government officials\n* Police officers\n* Ambulance and fire service personnel\n* People with disabilities and their carers\n* People with serious medical conditions\n\nParticipation and Incidents\n\nThe queue for the lying-in-state of Elizabeth II was a popular event, with an estimated 750,000 people participating over the course of the nine-day event. However, the event was not without incident. There were reports of people fainting and experiencing heat exhaustion due to the long wait and hot weather. Additionally, some people were seen to be pushing and shoving, causing congestion in the queue.\n\nResponses and Media Coverage\n\nThe queue for the lying-in-state of Elizabeth II was widely covered by the media, with many news outlets broadcasting live from the scene.
