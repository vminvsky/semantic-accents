social media platform after he was banned from Facebook and Twitter in 2021, following the 2021 United States Capitol attack [22] In May 2021, Trump launched \"From the Desk of Donald J Trump\", a web page where he posted short tweet-like announcements; it was shut down after less than a month, [23] with Trump's senior aide Jason Miller confirming it would not be coming back [24] [25]\n\n\nInception\nAccording to Reuters, two members of the cast of Trump's TV show The Apprentice, Wes Moss and Andy Litinsky, were \"central\" to the founding of Truth Social's parent company, the Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), having allegedly pitched the idea of a social network to Trump in January 2021 [26]\n\n\nBlank-check company and Chinese finance\nTo facilitate becoming a publicly traded company, a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) called Digital World Acquisition Corp (DWAC) was created with the help of ARC Capital, a Shanghai-based firm specializing in listing Chinese companies on American stock markets that has been a target of SEC investigations for misrepresenting shell corporations [27] [28] [29] [30] ARC also provided at least $2 million to get DWAC off the ground through a Singapore-based fund [30] Led by China-based banker Abraham Cinta, ARC Capital's global links included offices in Shanghai, Wuhan, Mexico City, and Jakarta, which Bloomberg News described as \"surprising\", due to Trump's comments on various foreign countries in office [31] [32] Some investors were surprised to learn their investment money was being used to finance a Trump company [33] The DWAC chief executive Patrick Orlando, a Florida-based financier and former Deutsche Bank trader, was also the chief executive of the Wuhan-based Yunhong Holdings/Yunhong International, registered in the offshore tax haven of the Cayman Islands [34] [35] [36] [37] In an October 2021 SEC filing, the special-purpose acquisition company Yunhong International stated its goal was to \"capitalize on growing opportunities created by consumer/lifestyle businesses that have their primary operations in Asia.\" [38] Reuters quoted a deleted presentation from 2020, in which ARC Capital said it \"was able to craft a Wuhan-based SPAC sponsored by a family office, structured by ARC in Singapore, to allow our client to enjoy the flexibility and benefits of the U.S financial markets.\" [30] Yunhong was liquidated in December 2021, while its backers remained involved with the DWAC and Truth Social venture [39] [30] An additional backer of the Trump social media venture, becoming the CFO of Digital World Acquisition, was Brazilian parliamentarian Luiz Philippe of Orléans-Braganza, a monarchist allied with Jair Bolsonaro [35] [40]\n\n\nPromotion and early reception\nIn October 2021, TMTG published a document outlining the Truth Social platform, citing a poll saying one-third of the U.S population polled had stated they would use a social media platform endorsed by Trump [41] On October 20, TMTG issued a press release announcing the platform would have its public launch in \"the first quarter of 2022.\" It was slated to enter limited beta for Apple iOS in November 2021, [42] [43] [44] and though it did not meet this schedule for its beta testing, [45] Trump claimed in December 2021 \"invited guests\" were already using the beta system [46] [47]\n\n\nRussian finance\nAccording to The Guardian, in December 2021, two loans totaling $8 million (~$8.87 million in 2023) were paid to Trump Media from obscure Putin-connected entities as the company was \"on the brink of collapse\" $2 million was paid by Paxum Bank, part-owned by Anton Postolnikov, a relation of Aleksandr Smirnov, a former Russian government official who now runs the Russian maritime company Rosmorport $6 million was paid by an ostensibly separate entity, ES Family Trust, whose director was the director of Paxum Bank at the same time As of March 2023, prosecutors in the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York were investigating the Russian ties [51] [52] The Washington Post reported that Trump Media paid a $240,000 finder's fee as part of the arrangement, allegedly to a party associated with Digital World [53]\n\n\nReactions\nThe New York Times described Truth Social as an addition to the field of already-existing alt-tech platforms [4] BBC journalist James Clayton stated the platform could be a more successful version of other alt-tech social media platforms like Parler and Gab and is an attempt by Trump to gain his \"megaphone\" back [8] Gettr CEO Jason Miller, a former Trump advisor, praised Truth Social and said the platform will cause Facebook and Twitter to \"lose even more market share\" [55] Gab said in a statement it supports Truth Social and users of Gab can follow Trump on his reserved Gab account [56]\n\n\nPlatform\nTruth Social is run by Trump Media & Technology Group, and headed by former California GOP Congressman Devin Nunes In 2022, Talking Points Memo stated Nunes' remuneration was $750,000 per year [61] Other senior employees included chief of technology Josh Adams and chief of product development Billy Boozer, who both subsequently left the company [62]\n\n\nPersonnel\nTruth Social is run by Trump Media & Technology Group, and headed by

chief of product development Billy Boozer, who both subsequently left the company [62]\n\n\nSoftware\nTruth Social is modeled heavily after Twitter; users are able to make posts (\"Truths\", similar to tweets) and share other users' posts (\"ReTruths\", similar to retweets) [66] The Truth Social platform uses a custom version of the free and open-source social network hosting software Mastodon as its backend, which omits several features, including polls and post visibility options [10]\n\n\nInfrastructure\nThe Truth Social service was originally hosted on RightForge, a company aimed at providing internet hosting for conservative causes that describes itself as \"The first global Internet infrastructure company committed to American principles online\" [82] [83]\n\n\nContent policies\nTruth Social was launched proclaiming itself as a \"big tent\" platform without political censorship, allowing for \"free expression\" without \"discriminating on the basis of political ideology\" [91] [92] [93]\n\n\nCensorship allegations\nThe platform has been widely accused of censorship [100] [101] [102] In June 2022, several accounts were banned after posting about investigations into the 2021 United States Capitol attack and the publicly televised January 6 hearings that detailed events leading up to the mob violence on that day, in which Trump supporters breached the United States Congress, seeking to overturn the 2020 presidential election [64] [103] [104]\n\n\nOperations\nTrump made the platform's first post on February 16, 2022 [107] That day, TMTG

the number of active users in the U.S at 1 million per month [134] On March 25, 2024, the day TMTG's stock began trading publicly, Truth Social had 277,000 U.S visitors, while Reddit had 32 million [135]\n\n\nAcquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk\nFollowing Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter, many commentators observed that a Musk-run Twitter would be likely to reduce demand for Truth Social's services [138] [139] Musk said that as of late April 2022, Truth Social iOS app downloads exceeded those of Twitter and TikTok on the same platform [140] He said Truth Social only existed because of Twitter's restrictions on free speech Describing Truth Social as a \"terrible name\", Musk joked that it should be renamed \"Trumpet\" [141] [142]\n\n\nFinancial issues\nAs of May 2022 [update], Truth Social had not secured any advertising revenue TMTG stated it \"expects to incur significant losses into the foreseeable future\" [155]\n\n\nRegulatory issues\nIn June 2022, federal regulators investigated whether TMTG had illegally coordinated with its holding company, Digital World Acquisition Corp, prior to the latter going public [173] A federal grand jury was empaneled as part of the investigation TMTG released a statement saying they are cooperating with the investigation [174] Due to the investigation, Digital World has not merged with TMTG as planned Digital World asked its shareholders to vote to allow an extra year to complete the merger, but as of September 6, 2022, it appeared they will not vote in favor of the extra time If the companies do not merge, Truth Social may not receive $1.3 billion from Digital World [175]\n\n\nShare price and value\nFollowing the merger of DWAC into TMTG, the merged company was listed on the NASDAQ stock market under the ticker symbol DJT, after Trump's initials [20] The share price of the company rose rapidly after the merger, reaching a price that gave the company a nominal value of $4.48bn [187] It fell over the subsequent days, losing 20% on one day alone after the announcement of the company's profit and loss results over the previous year [188] On 4 September 2024 shares closed below $17, valuing Trump's majority stake in the company at under $2bn on paper [189]\n\n\nNotable activity\nAlthough Donald Trump's participation in TMTG and the scale of his social media following was a major part of TMTG's marketing for Truth Social, [41] Trump was initially not a frequent user of the Truth Social platform He made the platform's first post on February 16, 2022, with the message \"Get ready!

shareholders to vote to allow an extra year to complete the merger, but as of September 6, 2022, it appeared they will not vote in favor of the extra time If the companies do not merge, Truth Social may not receive $1.3 billion from Digital World [175]\n\n\nShare price and value\nFollowing the merger of DWAC into TMTG, the merged company was listed on the NASDAQ stock market under the ticker

subsequent days, losing 20% on one day alone after the announcement of the company's profit and loss results over the previous year [188] On 4 September 2024 shares closed below $17, valuing Trump's majority stake in the company at under $2bn on paper [189]\n\n\nNotable activity\nAlthough Donald Trump's participation in TMTG and the scale of his social media following was a major part of TMTG's

serious injuries that contributed to their deaths before the crash [3]: 165  The aircraft fell rapidly and continued disintegrating before hitting the ground [3]: 54–55, 152–153 \n\n\nIn-flight breakup\nInvestigators were able to determine how the aircraft disintegrated and crashed [3]: 149–163  The aircraft began disintegrating immediately after being struck by a missile [3]: 160  Investigators believed that the disintegration of the forward section of the fuselage started between the left-side cockpit windows and the forward, left-exit door [3]: 151  The cockpit section and the business class section of the aircraft began tearing into a number of pieces before the aircraft descended rapidly toward the ground [3]: 150–152  During that period of time, the left engine intake ring had also fallen off the engine and fell in the same place as where some of these pieces fell [3]: 54, 60, 162 \n\n\nDebris field\nThe disintegration of the plane had caused the seats, pieces of interior wall and floor, overhead compartments, and other interior structures of the aircraft to fall out Some bodies, personal belongings, and other light objects had also fallen out of the plane As the result of the mid-air disintegration, the debris of the plane landed in six different areas [3]: 53 \n\n\nNearby aircraft\nThree other commercial aircraft were in the vicinity when the Malaysian airliner was shot down: Air India Flight 113 (AI113), a Boeing 787 en route from Delhi to Birmingham, EVA Air Flight 88 (BR88), a Boeing 777 en route from Paris to Taipei, and the closest aircraft, Singapore Airlines Flight 351 (SQ351), was 33 kilometres (21 mi) away, a Boeing 777 en route from Copenhagen to Singapore [3]: 41 \n\n\nRecovery of bodies\nA Ukraine Foreign Ministry representative said that the bodies found at the crash site would be taken to Kharkiv for identification, 270 kilometres (170 mi) to the north By the day after the crash, 181 of the 298 bodies had been found [80] Some were observed being placed in body bags and loaded onto trucks [81] [82] [83]\n\n\nAftermath\nAbout 90 minutes after the incident, Ukraine closed all routes in Eastern Ukrainian airspace, at all altitudes [3]: 101  The incident dramatically heightened fears about airliner shoot-downs, [114] leading to some airlines announcing that they would avoid flying over the conflict zones.\n\n\nInvestigation\nTwo parallel investigations were led by the Dutch, one into the technical cause of the crash, and a separate criminal inquiry [126] The technical report was released on 13 October 2015, [127] and the criminal investigation reported some of their findings in September 2016 [2] [128] According to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, the country in which an aviation incident occurs is responsible for the investigation, but that country may delegate the investigation to another state; Ukraine has delegated the leadership of both investigations to the Netherlands [129] [130] [131] [132]\n\n\nOn-site investigation\nIn the hours following the crash, a meeting was convened of the Trilateral Contact Group After they had held a video conference with representatives of insurgents affiliated with the Donetsk People's Republic (who controlled the area where the aircraft crashed), the rebels promised to \"provide safe access and security guarantees\" to \"the national investigation commission\" by co-operating with Ukrainian authorities and OSCE (Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe) monitors [133] During the first two days of investigation, the militants prevented the OSCE and the workers of Ukrainian Emergencies Ministry from freely working at the crash site Andrei Purgin, a leader of the Donetsk People's Republic, declared later that \"we will guarantee the safety of international experts on the scene as soon as Kiev concludes a ceasefire agreement\" [134]\n\n\nCause of the crash\nSoon after the crash both American and Ukrainian officials said that a 9M38 series surface-to-air missile strike was the most likely cause [157] If so, then the missile was fired from a mobile Soviet-designed Buk missile system (NATO reporting name: SA-11 \"Gadfly\") At the time, Buk was the only surface-to-air missile system known to be deployed in the region that was capable of reaching the cruising altitude of commercial air traffic [52] [158] [159] [160] [161] [162] Such systems, unless they receive information from larger networks, have limited capacity to distinguish between military and civilian aircraft [163] [164] [165]\n\n\nDutch Safety Board reports\nOn 9 September 2014, the preliminary report was released by the Dutch Safety Board (DSB) [8] [211]: 16  This preliminary report concluded that there was no evidence of any technical or operational failure in the aircraft or from the crew prior to the ending of the CVR and FDR recordings at 13.20:03 hrs (UTC) The report also said that \"damage observed on the forward fuselage and cockpit section of the aircraft appears to indicate that there were impacts from a large number of high-energy objects from outside the aircraft\" According to the investigators, this damage probably led to a loss of structural integrity that caused an in-flight break-up first of the forward parts of the aircraft and then of the remainder with an expansive geographic spread of the aircraft's pieces.\n\n\nPreliminary report\nOn 9 September 2014, the preliminary report was released by the Dutch Safety Board (DSB) [8] [211]: 16  This

of the remainder with an expansive geographic spread of the aircraft's pieces.\n\n\nFinal report\nThe Dutch Safety Board (DSB) issued its final report on the crash on 13 October 2015 The report concluded that the crash was caused by a Buk 9M38-series surface-to-air missile with a 9N314M warhead The warhead detonated outside and above the left-hand side of the cockpit Fragments from the exploding warhead killed the three people in the cockpit and caused structural damage to the airliner leading to an in-flight break-up resulting in a wreckage area of 50 square kilometres (19 sq mi) and loss of the lives of all 298 occupants [3] Based on evidence they were able to exclude meteor strikes, the aircraft having technical defects, a bomb, and an air-to-air attack as causes of the crash Calculating the trajectory of the missile, the Dutch National Aerospace Laboratory determined that it was fired within a 320-square-kilometre (120 sq mi) area southeast of Torez Narrowing down a specific launch site was outside the DSB's mandate [3]: 147  The findings did not specify who launched the Buk missile, but the area identified by the DSB was controlled by pro-Russian separatists at the time of the downing, according to the final report [213]\n\n\nCriminal investigation\nThe criminal investigation into the downing of MH17 is being led by the Public Prosecution Service of the Dutch Ministry of Justice, and is the largest in Dutch history, involving dozens of prosecutors and 200 investigators [218] Investigators interviewed witnesses and examined forensic samples, satellite data, intercepted communications, and information on the Web [219] Participating in the investigation along with the Netherlands, are the four other members of the joint investigation team (JIT), [220] Belgium, Ukraine, Australia, and lastly, Malaysia, [221] which joined in November 2014 [220] Early in the investigation, the JIT eliminated accident, internal terrorist attack or air-to-air attack from another aircraft as the cause of the crash [1]\n\n\nFindings of the joint investigation team\nOn 28 September 2016, the JIT gave a press conference in which it concluded that the aircraft was shot down with a 9M38 Buk missile fired from a rebel-controlled field near Pervomaisky (Первомайський), a town 6 km (3.7 mi) south of Snizhne [128] It also found the Buk missile system used had been transported from Russia into Ukraine on the day of the crash, and then back into Russia after the crash, with one missile less than it arrived with [1] [2] The JIT said they had identified 100 people, witnesses as well as suspects, who were involved in the movement of the Buk launcher, though they had not yet identified a clear chain of command to assess culpability, which was a matter for ongoing investigation The Dutch chief prosecutor said \"the evidence must stand before a court\" which would render final judgement [1] During the investigation, the JIT recorded and assessed five billion internet pages, interviewed 200 witnesses, collected half a million photos and videos, and analysed 150,000 intercepted phone calls [128] [230] According to JIT head prosecutor Fred Westerbeke the criminal investigation is based on \"immense body of evidence,\" including testimonies of live witnesses who saw the Buk launcher, primary radar data, original photos and videos [231]\n\n\nProposed international tribunal\nIn June 2015, the Netherlands, supported by the other JIT members, sought to create an international tribunal to prosecute those suspected of downing the Malaysian airliner, which would take up the case after the closing of the criminal investigation The Dutch hoped that an international tribunal would induce Russian cooperation, which was considered critical [245] In late June 2015, the Russian government rejected a request by the five countries on the investigative committee to form a UN tribunal which would try those responsible for the shooting down of the aircraft, calling it \"not timely and counterproductive.\" [246] On 8 July 2015, Malaysia, a member of the UN Security Council, distributed a draft resolution to establish such a tribunal This resolution was jointly proposed by the five JIT member countries Russian UN Ambassador Vitaly Churkin responded, \"I don't see any future for this resolution Unfortunately, it seems that this is an attempt to organize a grandiose, political show, which only damages efforts to find the guilty parties.\" [120] Russia later circulated a rival resolution which criticised the international investigation's lack of \"due transparency\" and demanded those responsible be brought to justice, but which did not call for a tribunal [247] In a vote, Malaysia's resolution gained majority support of the UNSC, but was vetoed by Russia [124]\n\n\nCriminal prosecution\nIn a statement made on 5 July 2017 by the Dutch Minister of Foreign Affairs Bert Koenders, it was announced that the JIT countries would prosecute any suspects identified in the downing of flight MH17 in the Netherlands and under Dutch law [248] A treaty between the Netherlands and Ukraine made it possible for the Netherlands to prosecute in the cases of all 298 victims, regardless of their nationality This treaty was signed on 7 July 2017, [249] and went into force on 28 August 2018 [250] On 21 March 2018, the Dutch government sent legislation to the parliament, allowing the suspects involved to be prosecuted in the Netherlands under Dutch law [251] [252]\n\n\nEuropean Court of Human Rights\nOn 10 July 2020, the Dutch government announced that it intended to take Russia to the European Court of Human Rights for \"its role in the downing\" of Flight MH17 By doing so, it said, it was \"offering maximum support\" to the individual cases already brought to the Court by the victims' families [278] [279]\n\n\nConvention on aviation legal action\nOn 14 March 2022, Australia and the Netherlands announced that they had launched a joint legal action against Russia under Article 84 of the Convention on International Civil Aviation [281]\n\n\nBritish ISC report\nOn 20 December 2017, the Intelligence and Security Committee of the UK Parliament published its annual report It contains a section titled \"Russian objectives and activity against UK and allied interests\" which quotes MI6 as stating: \"Russia conducts information warfare on a massive scale.. An early example of this was a hugely intensive, multichannel propaganda effort to persuade the world that Russia bore no responsibility for the shooting down of  [Malaysian Airlines flight] MH-17 (an outright falsehood: we know beyond any reasonable doubt that the Russian military supplied and subsequently recovered the missile launcher)\" [282] [283]\n\n\nIdentification of command figures\nIn December 2017, the Russian investigative portal The Insider, the news agency McClatchyDC, and Bellingcat following a joint investigation, confirmed the identity of a high-ranking military officer using a call-sign \"Dolphin\" to be Colonel General Nikolai Fedorovich Tkachev Tkachev is heard supervising the operation of Buk delivery and set-up in wiretaps acquired by JIT [284] [285] In April 2020 the same three teams identified another high-ranking figure in the chain of command referred to by many DPR and LPR operatives as \"Vladimir Ivanovich\" to be FSB Colonel General Andrey Ivanovich Burlaka, first deputy chief of the Russian border service [286] [287]\n\n\nCivil cases\nIn July 2015, a writ was filed in an American court by families of 18 victims accusing the separatist leader Igor Girkin of \"orchestrating the shootdown\" and the Russian government of being complicit in the act The writ was brought under the Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991 [288] In May 2016 families of 33 victims of the crash filed a claim against Russia and president Vladimir Putin in the European Court of Human Rights, arguing Russian actions violated the passengers' right to life [289] [290] A group of 270 relatives of Dutch victims joined the claim in May 2018 after the JIT concluded that Russia was involved [291] The Dutch government supported this claim by taking Russia to the European Court of Human Rights in July 2020, [278] [279] assuming that Moscow had \"effective control\" of the area of Ukraine where the missile was launched [292] In January 2023, the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights found that the \"areas in eastern Ukraine in separatist hands were, from 11 May 2014 and up to at least 26 January 2022, under the jurisdiction of the Russian Federation\", pointing to the presence in eastern Ukraine of Russian military personnel and regular Russian troops [293]\n\n\nReactions\nUkrainian President Petro Poroshenko called the crash the result of an act of terrorism, and also called for an international investigation into the crash [296]\n\n\nCountries\nUkrainian President Petro Poroshenko called the crash the result of an act of terrorism, and also called for an international investigation into the crash [296]\n\n\nOrganisations\nOn 17 July the European Union's representatives José Manuel Barroso and Herman Van Rompuy released a joint statement calling for an immediate and thorough investigation [321] The EU officials also said that Ukraine has first claim on the aircraft's black boxes [322]\n\n\nMemorials\nAfter the crash, memorial services were held in Australia [325] and in the Netherlands, which declared 23 July, the day when the first victims arrived in the country, a national day of mourning, the first since 1962 [326] [327] The opening ceremony of the AIDS 2014 conference, on 20 July, of which several delegates had been on board Flight MH17, began with a tribute to the victims of the crash [328] In Malaysia, makeshift memorials were created in the capital city of Kuala Lumpur [329]\n\n\nRussian media coverage\nCoverage by the Russian media has differed from coverage in most other countries [22] and has changed significantly over time [21] [23] According to Bellingcat, these changes have usually been in response to new evidence published by DSB and the investigation team [21] According to a poll conducted by the Levada Center between 18 and 24 July 2014, 80% of Russians surveyed believed that the crash of MH17 was caused by the Ukrainian military Only 3% of respondents blamed the disaster on the pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine [337] [338] [339] Researchers said views were influenced by the televisual infosphere [340] In the three days following the incident, the Russian Internet Research Agency \"troll farm\" posted 111,486 tweets from fake accounts [341] Mostly posted in Russian, the tweets initially said the rebels had shot down a Ukrainian airplane, but quickly switched to accusing Ukraine of carrying out the attack [342] This is both the largest number of tweets in any 24 hour period, and for any topic in the history of the Internet Research Agency (IRA) [343]\n\n\nInitial reactions\nOn the evening of the crash, the LifeNews portal reported that at around 16:00 local time the separatists shot down \"Ukrainian Air Force An-26 transport plane\" with a missile, calling it \"a new victory for the Donetsk militia\" [171] [348] [349] The news was immediately picked up and disseminated by many other news websites and the Russia-24 TV channel [171] Around the same time Leonid Kharchenko, who was responsible for the Buk launcher convoy through DPR, reported to his commander Sergei Dubinsky that the launcher is \"on the spot and has already downed one\" Ukrainian ground-attack airplane [267]\n\n\nClaims of shoot-down by the Ukrainian Air Force\nFor the first year following the crash, Russian state media claimed that a Ukrainian Air Force Su-25 jet had shot down Flight 17 [21] Radar data, allegedly from Russian air traffic controllers, which was leaked to a Moscow newspaper, was claimed to be proof that there were Ukrainian military jets near MH17 [353] Russia claimed that a Ukrainian Air Force deserter had told them that he had overheard Ukrainian pilots discussing having shot down the wrong plane on the day MH17 crashed [354]\n\n\nDebunking\nThe Sukhoi Su-25 is a ground attack aircraft and it is not designed to destroy aircraft [365] [366] The claim that the Su-25 could have downed the Boeing 777 with an air-to-air missile was studied and dismissed by the Joint-investigation team (JIT), Public Prosecution Service and numerous independent experts, including chief designer of the Su-25, Vladimir Babak  [ru; arz] [367] [368] [369] [370]\n\n\nClaims of shoot-down by a Ukrainian Buk\nIn May 2015, Novaya Gazeta published a report credited to a group of Russian military engineers Based on their analysis of debris and damage patterns on the hull of the aircraft, they concluded that the airliner was shot down by a Buk-M1 launcher with a 9M38M1 missile They claimed that the missile could not have been fired from Snizhne, but was instead fired from Zaroshchenske and that a Ukrainian anti-air unit was located there at that time [380] [381] In June 2015, the report was the subject of a press conference and was attributed to Mikhail Malisevskiy, chief engineer at Moscow-headquartered Almaz-Antey, the Buk missile manufacturer [382] The Security Service of Ukraine said that there were inaccuracies in this version, and called part of the report a fake [383] Ukrainska Pravda questioned claims about the Ukrainian anti-aircraft unit and stated that Zaroshchenske was under control of pro-Russian forces on the day of the shoot-down [384] Novaya Gazeta published an analysis, also denying the Almaz-Antey version, [385] which contained interviews with inhabitants of Zaroshchenske who denied claims that Ukrainian forces and Buk launchers were present in the village at that time [386] [387] According to Bellingcat, Russia's satellite images were from June and showed signs of editing [388] [389] Bild described the Russian satellite image as \"fake\" [390]\n\n\nConspiracy theories\nOn 18 July, Igor Girkin, the commander of the Donbas People's Militia, was quoted as stating that \"a significant number of the bodies weren't fresh\" He followed up by saying \"Ukrainian authorities are capable of any baseness\"; and also claimed that blood serum and medications were found in the wreckage in large quantities [395] Girkin also claimed that some of the passengers had died a few days before the crash [396]\n\n\nMaps\nThe shootdown of MH17 is featured in the fourth episode of eighteenth

a Boeing 787 en route from Delhi to Birmingham, EVA Air Flight 88 (BR88), a Boeing 777 en route from Paris to Taipei, and the closest aircraft, Singapore Airlines Flight 351 (SQ351), was 33 kilometres (21 mi) away, a Boeing 777 en route from Copenhagen to Singapore [3]: 41 \n\n\nRecovery of bodies\nA Ukraine Foreign Ministry representative said that the bodies found at the crash site would be taken to Kharkiv for identification, 270 kilometres (170 mi) to the north By the day after the crash, 181 of the 298 bodies had been found [80] Some were observed being placed in body bags and loaded onto trucks [81] [82] [83]\n\n\nAftermath\nAbout 90 minutes after the incident, Ukraine closed all routes in Eastern Ukrainian airspace, at all altitudes [3]: 101  The incident dramatically heightened fears about airliner shoot-downs, [114] leading to some airlines announcing that they would avoid flying over the conflict zones.\n\n\nInvestigation\nTwo parallel investigations were led by the Dutch, one into the technical cause of the crash, and a separate criminal inquiry [126] The technical report was released on 13 October 2015, [127] and the criminal investigation reported some of their findings in September 2016 [2] [128] According to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, the country in which an aviation incident occurs is responsible for the investigation, but that country may delegate the investigation to another state; Ukraine has delegated the leadership of both investigations to the Netherlands [129] [130] [131] [132]\n\n\nOn-site investigation\nIn the hours following the crash, a meeting was convened of the Trilateral Contact Group After they had held a video conference with representatives of insurgents affiliated with the Donetsk People's Republic (who controlled the area where the aircraft crashed), the rebels promised to \"provide safe access and security guarantees\" to \"the national investigation commission\" by co-operating with Ukrainian authorities and OSCE (Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe) monitors [133] During the first two days of investigation, the militants prevented the OSCE and the workers of Ukrainian Emergencies Ministry from freely working at the crash site Andrei Purgin, a leader of the Donetsk People's Republic, declared later that \"we will guarantee the safety of international experts on the scene as soon as Kiev concludes a ceasefire agreement\" [134]\n\n\nCause of the crash\nSoon after the crash both American and Ukrainian officials said that a 9M38 series surface-to-air missile strike was the most likely cause [157] If so, then the missile was fired from a mobile Soviet-designed Buk missile system (NATO reporting name: SA-11 \"Gadfly\") At the time, Buk was the only surface-to-air missile system known to be deployed in the region that was capable of reaching the cruising altitude of commercial air traffic [52] [158] [159] [160] [161] [162] Such systems, unless they receive information from larger networks, have limited capacity to distinguish between military and civilian aircraft [163] [164] [165]\n\n\nDutch Safety Board reports\nOn 9 September 2014, the preliminary report was released by the Dutch Safety Board (DSB) [8] [211]: 16  This preliminary report concluded that there was no evidence of any technical or operational failure in the aircraft or from the crew prior to the ending of the CVR and FDR recordings at 13.20:03 hrs (UTC) The report also said that \"damage observed on the forward fuselage and cockpit section of the aircraft appears to indicate that there were impacts from a large number of high-energy objects from outside the aircraft\" According to the investigators, this damage probably led to a loss of structural integrity that caused an in-flight break-up first of the forward parts of the aircraft and then of the remainder with an expansive geographic spread of the aircraft's pieces.\n\n\nPreliminary report\nOn 9 September 2014, the

caused an in-flight break-up first of the forward parts of the aircraft and then of the remainder with an expansive geographic spread of the aircraft's pieces.\n\n\nFinal report\nThe Dutch Safety Board (DSB) issued its final report on the crash on 13 October 2015 The report concluded that the crash was caused by a Buk 9M38-series surface-to-air missile with a 9N314M warhead The warhead detonated outside and above the left-hand side of the cockpit Fragments from the exploding warhead killed the three people in the cockpit and caused structural damage to the airliner leading to an in-flight break-up resulting in a wreckage area of 50 square kilometres (19 sq mi) and loss of the lives of all 298 occupants [3] Based on evidence they were able to exclude meteor strikes, the aircraft having technical defects, a bomb, and an air-to-air attack as causes of the crash Calculating the trajectory of the missile, the Dutch National Aerospace Laboratory determined that it was fired within a 320-square-kilometre (120 sq mi) area southeast of Torez Narrowing down a specific launch site was outside the DSB's mandate [3]: 147  The findings did not specify who launched the Buk missile, but the area identified by the DSB was controlled by pro-Russian separatists at the time of the downing, according to the final report [213]\n\n\nCriminal investigation\nThe criminal investigation into the downing of MH17 is being led by the Public Prosecution Service of the Dutch Ministry of Justice, and is the largest in Dutch history, involving dozens of prosecutors and 200 investigators [218] Investigators interviewed witnesses and examined forensic samples, satellite data, intercepted communications, and information on the Web [219] Participating in the investigation along with the Netherlands, are the four other members of the joint investigation team (JIT), [220] Belgium, Ukraine, Australia, and lastly, Malaysia, [221] which joined in November 2014 [220] Early in the investigation, the JIT eliminated accident, internal terrorist attack or air-to-air attack from another aircraft as the cause of the crash [1]\n\n\nFindings of the joint investigation team\nOn 28 September 2016, the JIT gave a press conference in which it concluded that the aircraft was shot down with a 9M38 Buk missile fired from a rebel-controlled field near Pervomaisky (Первомайський), a town 6 km (3.7 mi) south of Snizhne [128] It also found the Buk missile system used had been transported from Russia into Ukraine on the day of the crash, and then back into Russia after the crash, with one missile less than it arrived with [1] [2] The JIT said they had identified 100 people, witnesses as well as suspects, who were involved in the movement of the Buk launcher, though they had not yet identified a clear chain of command to assess culpability, which was a matter for ongoing investigation The Dutch chief prosecutor said \"the evidence must stand before a court\" which would render final judgement [1] During the investigation, the JIT recorded and assessed five billion internet pages, interviewed 200 witnesses, collected half a million photos and videos, and analysed 150,000 intercepted phone calls [128] [230] According to JIT head prosecutor Fred Westerbeke the criminal investigation is based on \"immense body of evidence,\" including testimonies of live witnesses who saw the Buk launcher, primary radar data, original photos and videos [231]\n\n\nProposed international tribunal\nIn June 2015, the Netherlands, supported by the other JIT members, sought to create an international tribunal to prosecute those suspected of downing the Malaysian airliner, which would take up the case after the closing of the criminal investigation The Dutch hoped that an international tribunal would induce Russian cooperation, which was considered critical [245] In late June 2015, the Russian government rejected a request by the five countries on the investigative committee to form a UN tribunal which would try those responsible for the shooting down of the aircraft, calling it \"not timely and counterproductive.\" [246] On 8 July 2015, Malaysia, a member of the UN Security Council, distributed a draft resolution to establish such a tribunal This resolution was jointly proposed by the five JIT member countries Russian UN Ambassador Vitaly Churkin responded, \"I don't see any future for this resolution Unfortunately, it seems that this is an attempt to organize a grandiose, political show, which only damages efforts to find the guilty parties.\" [120] Russia later circulated a rival resolution which criticised the international investigation's lack of \"due transparency\" and demanded those responsible be brought to justice, but which did not call for a tribunal [247] In a vote, Malaysia's resolution gained majority support of the UNSC, but was vetoed by Russia [124]\n\n\nCriminal prosecution\nIn a statement made on 5 July 2017 by the Dutch Minister of Foreign Affairs Bert Koenders, it was announced that the JIT countries would prosecute any suspects identified in the downing of flight MH17 in the Netherlands and under Dutch law [248] A treaty between the Netherlands and Ukraine made it possible for the Netherlands to prosecute in the cases of all 298 victims, regardless of their nationality This treaty was signed on 7 July 2017, [249] and went into force on 28 August 2018 [250] On 21 March 2018, the Dutch government sent legislation to the parliament, allowing the suspects involved to be prosecuted in the Netherlands under Dutch law [251] [252]\n\n\nEuropean Court of Human Rights\nOn 10 July 2020, the Dutch government announced that it intended to take Russia to the European Court of Human Rights for \"its role in the downing\" of Flight MH17 By doing so, it said, it was \"offering maximum support\" to the individual cases already brought to the Court by the victims' families [278] [279]\n\n\nConvention on aviation legal action\nOn 14 March 2022, Australia and the Netherlands announced that they had launched a joint legal action against Russia under Article 84 of the Convention on International Civil Aviation [281]\n\n\nBritish ISC report\nOn 20 December 2017, the Intelligence and Security Committee of the UK Parliament published its annual report It contains a section titled \"Russian objectives and activity against UK and allied interests\" which quotes MI6 as stating: \"Russia conducts information warfare on a massive scale.. An early example of this was a hugely intensive, multichannel propaganda effort to persuade the world that Russia bore no responsibility for the shooting down of  [Malaysian Airlines flight] MH-17 (an outright falsehood: we know beyond any reasonable doubt that the Russian military supplied and subsequently recovered the missile launcher)\" [282] [283]\n\n\nIdentification of command figures\nIn December 2017, the Russian investigative portal The Insider, the news agency McClatchyDC, and Bellingcat following a joint investigation, confirmed the identity of a high-ranking military officer using a call-sign \"Dolphin\" to be Colonel General Nikolai Fedorovich Tkachev Tkachev is heard supervising the operation of Buk delivery and set-up in wiretaps acquired by JIT [284] [285] In April 2020 the same three teams identified another high-ranking figure in the chain of command referred to by many DPR and LPR operatives as \"Vladimir Ivanovich\" to be FSB Colonel General Andrey Ivanovich Burlaka, first deputy chief of the Russian border service [286] [287]\n\n\nCivil cases\nIn July 2015, a writ was filed in an American court by families of 18 victims accusing the separatist leader Igor Girkin of \"orchestrating the shootdown\" and the Russian government of being complicit in the act The writ was brought under the Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991 [288] In May 2016 families of 33 victims of the crash filed a claim against Russia and president Vladimir Putin in the European Court of Human Rights, arguing Russian actions violated the passengers' right to life [289] [290] A group of 270 relatives of Dutch victims joined the claim in May 2018 after the JIT concluded that Russia was involved [291] The Dutch government supported this claim by taking Russia to the European Court of Human Rights in July 2020, [278] [279] assuming that Moscow had \"effective control\" of the area of Ukraine where the missile was launched [292] In January 2023, the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights found that the \"areas in eastern Ukraine in separatist hands were, from 11 May 2014 and up to at least 26 January 2022, under the jurisdiction of the Russian Federation\", pointing to the presence in eastern Ukraine of Russian military personnel and regular Russian troops [293]\n\n\nReactions\nUkrainian President Petro Poroshenko called the crash the result of an act of terrorism, and also called for an international investigation into the crash [296]\n\n\nCountries\nUkrainian President Petro Poroshenko called the crash the result of an act of terrorism, and also called for an international investigation into the crash [296]\n\n\nOrganisations\nOn 17 July the European Union's representatives José Manuel Barroso and Herman Van Rompuy released a joint statement calling for an immediate and thorough investigation [321] The EU officials also said that Ukraine has first claim on the aircraft's black boxes [322]\n\n\nMemorials\nAfter the crash, memorial services were held in Australia [325] and in the Netherlands, which declared 23 July, the day when the first victims arrived in the country, a national day of mourning, the first since 1962 [326] [327] The opening ceremony of the AIDS 2014 conference, on 20 July, of which several delegates had been on board Flight MH17, began with a tribute to the victims of the crash [328] In Malaysia, makeshift memorials were created in the capital city of Kuala Lumpur [329]\n\n\nRussian media coverage\nCoverage by the Russian media has differed from coverage in most other countries [22] and has changed significantly over time [21] [23] According to Bellingcat, these changes have usually been in response to new evidence published by DSB and the investigation team [21] According to a poll conducted by the Levada Center between 18 and 24 July 2014, 80% of Russians surveyed believed that the crash of MH17 was caused by the Ukrainian military Only 3% of respondents blamed the disaster on the pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine [337] [338] [339] Researchers said views were influenced by the televisual infosphere [340] In the three days following the incident, the Russian Internet Research Agency \"troll farm\" posted 111,486 tweets from fake accounts [341] Mostly posted in Russian, the tweets initially said the rebels had shot down a Ukrainian airplane, but quickly switched to accusing Ukraine of carrying out the attack [342] This is both the largest number of tweets in any 24 hour period, and for any topic in the history of the Internet Research Agency (IRA) [343]\n\n\nInitial reactions\nOn the evening of the crash, the LifeNews portal reported that at around 16:00 local time the separatists shot down \"Ukrainian Air Force An-26 transport plane\" with a missile, calling it \"a new victory for the Donetsk militia\" [171] [348] [349] The news was immediately picked up and disseminated by many other news websites and the Russia-24 TV channel [171] Around the same time Leonid Kharchenko, who was responsible for the Buk launcher convoy through DPR, reported to his commander Sergei Dubinsky that the launcher is \"on the spot and has already downed one\" Ukrainian ground-attack airplane [267]\n\n\nClaims of shoot-down by the Ukrainian Air Force\nFor the first year following the crash, Russian state media claimed that a Ukrainian Air Force Su-25 jet had shot down Flight 17 [21] Radar data, allegedly from Russian air traffic controllers, which was leaked to a Moscow newspaper, was claimed to be proof that there were Ukrainian military jets near MH17 [353] Russia claimed that a Ukrainian Air Force deserter had told them that he had overheard Ukrainian pilots discussing having shot down the wrong plane on the day MH17 crashed [354]\n\n\nDebunking\nThe Sukhoi Su-25 is a ground attack aircraft and it is not designed to destroy aircraft [365] [366] The claim that the Su-25 could have downed the Boeing 777 with an air-to-air missile was studied and dismissed by the Joint-investigation team (JIT), Public Prosecution Service and numerous independent experts, including chief designer of the Su-25, Vladimir Babak  [ru; arz] [367] [368] [369] [370]\n\n\nClaims of shoot-down by a Ukrainian Buk\nIn May 2015, Novaya Gazeta published a report credited to a group of Russian military engineers Based on their analysis of debris and damage patterns on the hull of the aircraft, they concluded that the airliner was shot down by a Buk-M1 launcher with a 9M38M1 missile They claimed that the missile could not have been fired from Snizhne, but was instead fired from Zaroshchenske and that a Ukrainian anti-air unit was located there at that time [380] [381] In June 2015, the report was the subject of a press conference and was attributed to Mikhail Malisevskiy, chief engineer at Moscow-headquartered Almaz-Antey, the Buk missile manufacturer [382] The Security Service of Ukraine said that there were inaccuracies in this version, and called part of the report a fake [383] Ukrainska Pravda questioned claims about the Ukrainian anti-aircraft unit and stated that Zaroshchenske was under control of pro-Russian forces on the day of the shoot-down [384] Novaya Gazeta published an analysis, also denying the Almaz-Antey version, [385] which contained interviews with inhabitants of Zaroshchenske who denied claims that Ukrainian forces and Buk launchers were present in the village at that time [386] [387] According to Bellingcat, Russia's satellite images were from June and showed signs of editing [388] [389] Bild described the Russian satellite image as \"fake\" [390]\n\n\nConspiracy theories\nOn 18 July, Igor Girkin, the commander of the Donbas People's Militia, was quoted as stating that \"a significant number of the bodies weren't fresh\" He followed up by saying \"Ukrainian authorities are capable of any baseness\"; and also claimed that blood serum and medications were found in the wreckage in large quantities [395] Girkin also claimed that some of the passengers had died a few days before the crash [396]\n\n\nMaps\nThe shootdown of MH17 is featured in the fourth episode of eighteenth season of the Canadian documentary television programme Mayday, in the episode titled \"Deadly Airspace\" [407] It is also a major event in Maryna Er Gorbach's film Klondike [408]\n\n\nIn popular

finishing ninth at the Monaco Grand Prix [1] [43]\n\n\n2014 Suzuka accident\nThe 2014 Japanese Grand Prix was held at the Suzuka Circuit on 5 October, under intermittent heavy rainfall caused by the approaching Typhoon Phanfone and in fading daylight.\n\n\nTeam and driver reactions\nAt the inaugural Russian Grand Prix, one week after the accident, Marussia originally registered Alexander Rossi in place of the hospitalised Bianchi, before finally deciding to field only a single car driven by Max Chilton [63]\n\n\nFIA reaction and investigation\nFollowing Bianchi's accident, the FIA began an investigation and also considered appropriate changes to safety procedures, such as those at the Brazilian Grand Prix, where the location of a tractor crane serving the Senna S chicane was altered.\n\n\nMedical treatment and updates\nThe first family update following Bianchi's emergency surgery was made by his father in the week beginning 13 October 2014 Bianchi was reported to be in a \"desperate\" condition, with doctors describing his survival as a miracle Even so, the father openly stated that he drew hope from Michael Schumacher waking from his coma [83]  Marussia also issued regular updates on Bianchi's condition while rejecting initial speculation about their role in the accident [84]\n\n\nDeath\nBianchi died on 17 July 2015, aged 25, from injuries sustained at the time

number of incidents which resulted in tensions between both drivers and the team, culminating in Alonso and McLaren terminating their contract by mutual consent in November Following a successful first season at McLaren, Hamilton signed a multi-million-pound contract to stay with the team until 2012 [66]\n\n\n2009–2012: Final years at McLaren\nDuring his last four years with McLaren, Hamilton continued to score podium finishes and race victories, and twice challenged for the title despite Red Bull's dominance during that time-period Major technical regulation changes in 2009 led to a challenging start for McLaren [71] Often qualifying outside of the top ten, and struggling to finish on points, Hamilton's chances of defending his title became unfeasible Major upgrades at the German Grand Prix saw a dramatic improvement in performance of the McLaren MP4-24 From that point onward, Hamilton advanced from eleventh to fifth in the Driver's Championship standings, with securing two race wins and five podium finishes [72]\n\n\nMercedes (2013–2024)\nUpon signing with Mercedes in 2013, Hamilton was reunited with his childhood karting teammate, Nico Rosberg The move was met with surprise by pundits and the public, with some describing the move to Mercedes, a team with no recent history of success, as a gamble [79] [80] In his first season with the Brackley-based team, Hamilton secured a sole race victory, winning the Hungarian Grand Prix, where he converted an unexpected pole position into a winning margin of over 11 seconds ahead of second-placed Räikkönen [81] With a number of other podium finishes and pole positions, Hamilton finished fourth in the standings once again, the third time in five years [78]\n\n\n2013–2016: Teammates with Rosberg\nUpon signing with Mercedes in 2013, Hamilton was reunited with his childhood karting teammate, Nico Rosberg The move was met with surprise by pundits and the public, with some describing the move to Mercedes, a team with no recent history of success, as a gamble [79] [80] In his first season with the Brackley-based team, Hamilton secured a sole race victory, winning the Hungarian Grand Prix, where he converted an unexpected pole position into a winning margin of over 11 seconds ahead of second-placed Räikkönen [81] With a number of other podium finishes and pole positions, Hamilton finished fourth in the standings once again, the third time in five years [78]\n\n\n2017–2020: Four titles in a row\nFollowing Rosberg's retirement, Ferrari's Vettel became Hamilton's closest rival as the pair exchanged the championship lead throughout 2017 in a tense title fight Hamilton registered 11 pole positions that season as he took the record for the all-time most pole positions, and his consistency (finishing every race in the points), as well as a lack of a serious challenge from his new team-mate Valtteri Bottas, saw him record nine race victories and secure his fourth World Drivers' title as he overturned a points deficit to Vettel in the first half of the season, ultimately wrapping the title up in Mexico with two races to spare [78]\n\n\n2021: Title battle vs. Verstappen\nRegulation changes for the 2021 season drastically affecting Mercedes meant Red Bull having the upper hand, winning six (four consecutive) out of the eleven races before the summer break [108] Early on in the season, Hamilton and Red Bull's Verstappen emerged as title favourites, as both drivers often finished races first and second simultaneously [109] The pair engaged in several on-track battles throughout the season—often sparring (and occasionally coming together) on track Hamilton achieved his 100th pole position and race win at the Spanish Grand Prix and Russian Grand Prix respectively, becoming the first driver to do so [110] [111] Winning three of the last four races, including the impressive recovery drive in Brazil—which was acclaimed as one of the greatest sporting performances, [112] meant Hamilton diminishing a 19 point deficit to Verstappen, to enter the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix level on points In Abu Dhabi, despite having led the majority of the race, Hamilton was denied the championship by a last-lap overtake from Verstappen following a late safety car.\n\n\n2022–2024: Mercedes' struggles and departure\nI feel like this year  [2022], when we got our first fifth, it felt like a win When we got our first fourth, it felt like a win When we got our first podium, it felt like a win, and those second places felt as if we really achieved something, so I'll just hold on to those.\n\n\nFerrari (2025)\nFollowing the rumours and speculation over the course of the 2023 season, Ferrari announced prior to the start of the 2024 season that they had reached an agreement with Hamilton to join the team in 2025 on a multi-year contract, replacing the outgoing Carlos Sainz Jr [137] [138] The Athletic described the move as \"one of the biggest driver transfer shocks the sport has known\", recalling his similar shock move from McLaren to Mercedes back in 2013 [137] This transition marks the first time in his Formula One career that Hamilton will not be driving for a Mercedes-powered team, [139] meaning the end of Hamilton's record-breaking streak of most consecutive seasons driving for a single constructor [140]\n\n\nDriver profile\nHamilton is regarded as one of the most complete drivers on the grid, [141] excelling across a wide range of areas [142] He has been described as having an aggressive driving style, [143] with a natural aptitude for identifying the limits of the car; Mark Hughes, writing for the official Formula One website, described how Hamilton is \"super-hard on the brakes .. but has a fantastic ability to match how quickly the downforce is bleeding off with his modulation of the pressure so that there's no wasted grip but no locked wheels either.\" [144] [145] Paddy Lowe, previously the engineering director for McLaren, described how Hamilton is comfortable with levels of rear instability that most other drivers would find intolerable [144]\n\n\nDriving style\nHamilton is regarded as one of the most complete

talent, he's a good guy, he gets out on the street and supports and promotes Formula One He is box office, 100 per cent.\n\n\nHelmet\nFrom a young age, Hamilton's helmet throughout his karting years was predominantly yellow with blue, green and red ribbons In later years a white ring was added and the ribbons were moved forward to make room for logos and advertisement space [206] Hamilton continued to run a predominantly yellow design for the early stage of his Formula One career, but in 2014 decided to change to a mostly white approach [207] In 2017, Hamilton selected his helmet design from fan submissions [208] The winning design used a white and yellow base colour with red and orange details, and the addition of three stars, one for each of Hamilton's three Formula One championships at that time, on either side [209] Over the following seasons, Hamilton continued to add more stars to his helmet on winning further World Championship titles [210]\n\n\nRivalries\nHamilton's debut season saw him partner two-time and defending World Champion Fernando Alonso In their time as teammates, tensions arose between the two drivers and McLaren as a result of several incidents The first tensions surfaced after Hamilton finished second behind Alonso at Monaco in 2007 [227] After post-race comments made by Hamilton which suggested he had been forced into a supporting role, the FIA investigated whether McLaren had broken rules by enforcing team orders [228] McLaren denied favouring Alonso, and the FIA subsequently vindicated the team, stating that \"McLaren were able to pursue an optimum team strategy because they had a substantial advantage over all other cars .. nothing which could be described as interfering with the race result.\" [228]\n\n\nFernando Alonso\nHamilton's debut season saw him partner two-time and defending World Champion Fernando Alonso In their time as teammates, tensions arose between the two drivers

result.\" [228]\n\n\nNico Rosberg\nWhen Hamilton joined Mercedes in 2013, he was paired alongside old karting teammate and friend Nico Rosberg Over their four seasons as teammates, a period of Mercedes dominance in Formula One, the pair's relationship became strained and, at times, led to volatile confrontations on and off the track [244] Hamilton and Rosberg were first teammates in 2000, when they were in karting [245] They raced for Mercedes Benz McLaren in Formula A, where Hamilton became European champion, with Rosberg not far behind Robert Kubica, who raced with them before Formula One, recalled how they were competitive both on and off the track, saying that \"they would even have races to eat pizza, always eating two at a time.\" [246] Sports journalist Paul Weaver contrasts their upbringings; [246] Rosberg, an only child, was born in Germany but brought up in Monaco and was the son of a wealthy former Formula One world champion, Keke Rosberg, whereas Hamilton was born on a council estate in Stevenage, and his father had to work multiple jobs to fund his son's junior racing [20]\n\n\nSebastian Vettel\nHamilton describes his rivalry with Sebastian Vettel as his favourite, believing their battles helped bring them closer together [249] After three years of Mercedes's dominance from 2014 to 2016, Ferrari produced a car that was capable of fighting for the championship in 2017 and 2018 [250] [251] [252] [253] Vettel, who was then driving for Ferrari, enjoyed an early lead on points, but Mercedes and Hamilton fought back and ultimately won the championships in both seasons While there were some on-track flash points, most notably the 2017 Azerbaijan Grand Prix, when Vettel accused Hamilton of brake checking and drove into Hamilton in retaliation, earning a penalty, [254] the pair developed a strong mutual respect in a hard but fairly contested fight [255] [256] [257] In 2021, Hamilton recalled:\n\n\nPublic image and influence\nThe first and as of 2024 the only black driver to race in Formula One, Hamilton has been subject to racist abuse throughout his career In 2007, Hamilton suffered racist abuse from Spanish Formula One supporters at the Chinese Grand Prix [259] In 2008, Hamilton was heckled and otherwise abused during pre-season testing at the Circuit de Catalunya by several Spanish spectators who wore black face paint and black wigs, as well as shirts bearing the words \"Hamilton's familly  [sic]\" [260] The FIA warned Spanish authorities about the repetition of such behaviour, [261] and launched a \"Race Against Racism\" campaign [262] Shortly before the 2008 Brazilian Grand Prix, a website owned by the Spanish branch of the New York-based advertising agency TBWA and named pinchalaruedadeHamilton, which translates into English as \"burst Hamilton's tyre\", was featured in the British media The site contained an image of Interlagos that allowed users to leave nails and porcupines on the track for Hamilton's car to run over Among thousands of comments left since 2007, some included racial insults [263] In 2021, Hamilton was subjected to online racist abuse following a controversial win at the British Grand Prix Mercedes, Formula One, and the FIA issued a joint statement condemning the abuse and called for those responsible to be held accountable [264]\n\n\nRacist treatment\nThe first

British Grand Prix Mercedes, Formula One, and the FIA issued a joint statement condemning the abuse and called for those responsible to be held accountable [264]\n\n\nActivism and philanthropy\nPeople come up to me from different ethnic backgrounds saying, \"My kid wants to be you one day\", and I can assure you that when I started racing, there weren't people from those  [ethnic backgrounds] I take great pride in that.\n\n\nDiversity and anti-racism\nPeople come up to me from different ethnic backgrounds saying, \"My kid wants to be you one day\", and I can assure you that when I started

the allegations of sportswashing Hamilton said he \"won't let it go unnoticed\" after an 11-year-old boy, Ahmed Ramadhan, wrote a letter to Hamilton, asking him to save his father, who was facing the death penalty, after a confession was allegedly extracted through torture for the death of a policeman [290] [291] Hamilton spoke to human rights organisations and legal experts He also spoke with Bahraini officials about the country's human rights The F1 champion said that while he had no authority to choose the location for his race, \"going to these countries and just ignoring what is happening in those places\" is not the right way [292] In July 2021, Hamilton spoke out against the \"cowardly\" Hungarian anti-LGBT law, after the country introduced a law that limits discussions of LGBT sexualities in school [293]\n\n\nEnvironmental and animal rights\nHamilton has repeatedly discussed environmental issues and animal rights at conferences, in interviews and in documentaries [295] [296] He also uses his social media platforms to gather support for his initiatives, [297] which range from urging China to reclassify dogs as pets instead of livestock, [298] and backing charities which fight the illegal wildlife trade, [299] to calling for the protection of the Amazon rainforest [300] In January 2020, he donated US$500,000 (approximately £383,000) to a variety of causes relating to the bushfire crisis in Australia [301] The money went towards the fire services and animal welfare charities [302]\n\n\nUNICEF and #TOGETHERBAND\nIn 2012, Hamilton began working with the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) In March 2012, Hamilton travelled to the Philippines where he made a short film about Manila's street children The film was shown on ITV1 during Soccer Aid and helped raise over £4.9 million for UNICEF [306] [307] [308] In October 2012, while in India for the Grand Prix, Hamilton visited a UNICEF-funded newborn care unit and nutrition centre Hamilton said: \"As a sportsman in the public eye, I know I have a role to play in helping to tell the stories of the world's most vulnerable children and I jumped at the chance to be able to do that again after a visit to Manila.\" [309] [310] [311]\n\n\nOther charities\nOver the past decade, Hamilton has made time for a variety of good causes, such as making donations and hospital visits to sick children [323] [324] [325] He has invited fans, young people, [326] [327] and their families to join him at Grand Prix races and social events [328] [329] [330] In 2013, he became the Global Education Ambassador for Save the Children, supporting and promoting its education campaigns [331] [332] [333] Two years later, Hamilton became the first ambassador for the Invictus Games Foundation, supporting wounded, injured, and sick servicemen and women [334] [335] [336] During the COVID-19 pandemic, Hamilton's Neat Burger restaurant donated free meals to frontline NHS workers [337] [338] Neat Burger also launched the \"Kids Eat Free\" scheme, serving free meals to school children during the half-term break [339] [340]\n\n\nMedia reception\nIn December 2018, Stevenage-born Hamilton caused controversy at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Awards where he said on live television, \"It really was a dream for us all as a family to do something different For us to get out of the slums\" before immediately correcting himself, saying, \"Well, not the slums, but to get out of somewhere and do something We all set our goals very, very high but we did it as a team.\" While Hamilton immediately sought to correct his remarks, the leader of Stevenage Borough Council described the comments as \"disappointing\" and observed that people felt \"very offended\" [357] Hamilton posted a video on Instagram in which he apologised for his comments, saying: \"I'm super proud of where I come from and I hope you know that I represent in the best way I can always .. Particularly when you are up in front of a crowd, trying to find the right words to express the long journey you've had in life, I chose the wrong words.\" [358] The town mayor subsequently accepted his \"gracious apology\" [359]\n\n\nOther ventures\nHamilton also has interests in music, saying that \"music has been a huge passion of mine since I was really young I started playing guitar when I was 13 In here, I can be me, I can be vulnerable I can show a side of me that people don't get to see.\" [375] He features on Christina Aguilera's 2018 song \"Pipe\" under the pseudonym XNDA, although he did not confirm this until July 2020, when he revealed he had been writing and recording music for ten years [376] [377] During his final year with McLaren, Hamilton voiced an animated version of himself in the short series Tooned Hamilton also made a guest appearance in Cars 2 (2011) in which he voices an anthropomorphic version of himself [378] He then voiced a voice command assistant in Cars 3 (2017) [379] Hamilton is credited as an executive producer for the 2018 documentary film The Game Changers [380] Hamilton has also revealed he was offered a role as a fighter pilot in the film Top Gun: Maverick (2022) by Tom Cruise but was forced to decline due to his Formula One commitments [381] He was also served as the \"maestro\" of the Gran Turismo series since Gran Turismo Sport in 2017, [382] and his Time Trial Challenge DLC pack was released in that said game on 28 November 2019 [383] He was one of the executive producers on Motorcycle Mary (2024), a short documentary film about Mary McGee [384]\n\n\nPersonal life\nIn 2017, Hamilton told the BBC that he had become vegan because \" [a]s the human race, what we are doing to the world .. the pollution  [in terms of emissions of global-warming gases] coming from the amount of cows that are being produced is incredible The cruelty is horrible and I don't necessarily want to support that and I want to live a healthier life.\" [400] In 2018 he was named the PETA Person of the Year for his vegan activism [401] The same year Hamilton said in an interview that he gave up drinking \"a while ago\" [402] His racing number has always been 44 because when he started racing at age 8 his father's red Vauxhall Cavalier had the number plate \"F44\" and it was his father's idea to use it [403]\n\n\nLegal issues\nHamilton was suspended from driving in France for a month on 18 December 2007 after being caught speeding at 196 km/h (122 mph) on a French motorway His Mercedes-Benz CLK was also impounded [416] [417] Two days before the 2010 Australian Grand Prix, Victoria Police witnessed Hamilton \"deliberately losing traction\" in his silver Mercedes-AMG C63, and impounded the car for 48 hours Hamilton immediately released a statement of apology for \"driving in an over-exuberant manner\" After being charged with intentionally losing control of a vehicle, Hamilton was eventually fined A$500 (£288), being described as a \"hoon\" by the magistrate [418] [419] [420]\n\n\nResidence\nHamilton moved to Luins, Vaud, Switzerland, in 2007, citing privacy as his main reason for leaving the UK He later said on the television show Parkinson that taxation was also a factor in his decision [422] [423] [424] In 2010, Hamilton, like many other Formula One drivers, moved to Monaco, purchasing a house worth a reported £10 million Hamilton also owns an apartment in Manhattan, New York, which he bought for US$40 million in 2017, and an estate in Colorado where he has said he would live after his retirement [425]\n\n\nWealth and income\nIn 2015 Hamilton was ranked as the richest British sportsperson, with an estimated personal fortune of £88 million [426] In 2018 it was reported that Hamilton had a net worth of £159 million [427] In 2020 Hamilton's fortune was an estimated £224 million, making him the richest British sports star in the history of the Sunday Times Rich List [428] By 2022 that figure had increased to £300 million [429]\n\n\nKarting record\n* Season still in progress.\n\n\nKarting career summary\n* Season still in progress.\n\n\nRacing record\n* Season still in progress.\n\n\nRacing career summary\n* Season still in progress.\n\n\nComplete Formula Renault 2.0 UK Championship results\n(key) (Races in bold indicate pole position;

He is widely regarded as one of the greatest drivers in the history of the sport, having won numerous awards and accolades throughout his career. Hamilton is also known for his philanthropic efforts and has been recognized for his contributions to various charitable organizations.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nLewis Hamilton was born on 7 January 1985 in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, England. His father, Anthony Hamilton, is of Afro-Grenadian descent, while his mother, Carmen Larbalestier, is White British from Birmingham. Hamilton's parents separated when he was two years old, and he lived with his mother and older half-sisters, Samantha and Nicola, until he was twelve. He then lived with his father, stepmother Linda, and his half-brother Nicolas, who is also a professional racing driver.\n\nHamilton was raised a Catholic and has stated that he was a shy and introverted child. However, he found solace in karting, which he began at the age of eight. He quickly became a talented driver and won several championships, including the British cadet karting championship at the age of ten.\n\n**Junior Racing Career**\n\nHamilton's junior racing career was marked by numerous successes. He won the British Formula Ford Winter Series in 2001 and the Formula Renault UK championship in 2002. He also competed in the Formula 3 Euro Series, where he finished second in the championship in 2005.\n\n**GP2 Series**\n\nHamilton moved to the GP2 Series in 2006, where he won the championship at his first attempt. He secured a dominant win at the Nürburgring, despite a penalty for speeding in the pit lane.

first season at McLaren, Hamilton signed a multi-million-pound contract to stay with the team until 2012 [66]\n\n\n2009–2012: Final years at McLaren\nDuring his last four years with McLaren, Hamilton continued to score podium finishes and race victories, and twice challenged for the title despite Red Bull's dominance during that time-period Major technical regulation changes in 2009 led to a challenging start for McLaren [71] Often qualifying outside of the top ten, and struggling to finish on points, Hamilton's chances of defending his title became unfeasible Major upgrades at the German Grand Prix saw a dramatic improvement in performance of the McLaren MP4-24 From that point onward, Hamilton advanced from eleventh to fifth in the Driver's Championship standings, with securing two race wins and five podium finishes [72]\n\n\nMercedes (2013–2024)\nUpon signing with Mercedes in 2013, Hamilton was reunited with his childhood karting teammate, Nico Rosberg The move was met with surprise by pundits and the public, with some describing the move to Mercedes, a team with no recent history of success, as a gamble [79] [80] In his first season with the Brackley-based team, Hamilton secured a sole race victory, winning the Hungarian Grand Prix, where he converted an unexpected pole position into a winning margin of over 11 seconds ahead of second-placed Räikkönen [81] With a number of other podium finishes and pole positions, Hamilton finished fourth in the standings once again, the third time in five years [78]\n\n\n2013–2016: Teammates with Rosberg\nUpon signing with Mercedes in 2013, Hamilton was reunited with his childhood karting teammate, Nico Rosberg The move was met with surprise by pundits and the public, with some describing the move to Mercedes, a team with no recent history of success, as a gamble [79] [80] In his first season with the Brackley-based team, Hamilton secured a sole race victory, winning the Hungarian Grand Prix, where he

in the standings once again, the third time in five years [78]\n\n\n2017–2020: Four titles in a row\nFollowing Rosberg's retirement, Ferrari's Vettel became Hamilton's closest rival as the pair exchanged the championship lead throughout 2017 in a tense title fight Hamilton registered 11 pole positions that season as he took the record for the all-time most pole positions, and his consistency (finishing every race in the points), as well as a lack of a serious challenge from his new team-mate Valtteri Bottas, saw him record nine race victories and secure his fourth World Drivers' title as he overturned a points deficit to Vettel in the first half of the season, ultimately wrapping the title up in Mexico with two races to spare [78]\n\n\n2021: Title battle vs. Verstappen\nRegulation changes for the 2021 season drastically affecting Mercedes meant Red Bull having the upper hand, winning six (four consecutive) out of the eleven races before the summer break [108] Early on in the season, Hamilton and Red Bull's Verstappen emerged as title favourites, as both drivers often finished races first and second simultaneously [109] The pair engaged in several on-track battles throughout the season—often sparring (and occasionally coming together) on track Hamilton achieved his 100th pole position and race win at the Spanish Grand Prix and Russian Grand Prix respectively, becoming the first driver to do so [110] [111] Winning three of the last four races, including the impressive recovery drive in Brazil—which was acclaimed as one of the greatest sporting performances, [112] meant Hamilton diminishing a 19 point deficit to Verstappen, to enter the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix level on points In Abu Dhabi, despite having led the majority of the race, Hamilton was denied the championship by a last-lap overtake from Verstappen following a late safety car.\n\n\n2022–2024: Mercedes' struggles and departure\nI feel like this year  [2022], when we got our first fifth, it felt like a win When we got our first fourth, it felt like a win When we got our first podium, it felt like a win, and those second places felt as if we really achieved something, so I'll just hold on to those.\n\n\nFerrari (2025)\nFollowing the rumours and speculation over the course of the 2023 season, Ferrari announced prior to the start of the 2024 season that they had reached an agreement with Hamilton to join the team in 2025 on a multi-year contract, replacing the outgoing Carlos Sainz Jr [137] [138] The Athletic described the move as \"one of the biggest driver transfer shocks the sport has known\", recalling his similar shock move from McLaren to Mercedes back in 2013 [137] This transition marks the first time in his Formula One career that Hamilton will not be driving for a Mercedes-powered team, [139] meaning the end of Hamilton's record-breaking streak of most consecutive seasons driving for a single constructor [140]\n\n\nDriver profile\nHamilton is regarded as one of the most complete drivers on the grid, [141] excelling across a wide range of areas [142] He has been described as having an aggressive driving style, [143] with a natural aptitude for identifying the limits of the car; Mark Hughes, writing for the official Formula One website, described how Hamilton is \"super-hard on the brakes .. but has a fantastic ability to match how quickly the downforce is bleeding off with his modulation of the pressure so that there's no wasted grip but no locked wheels either.\" [144] [145] Paddy Lowe, previously the engineering director for McLaren, described how Hamilton is comfortable with levels of rear instability that most other drivers would find intolerable [144]\n\n\nDriving style\nHamilton is regarded as one of the most complete

talent, he's a good guy, he gets out on the street and supports and promotes Formula One He is box office, 100 per cent.\n\n\nHelmet\nFrom a young age, Hamilton's helmet throughout his karting years was predominantly yellow with blue, green and red ribbons In later years a white ring was added and the ribbons were moved forward to make room for logos and advertisement space [206] Hamilton continued to run a predominantly yellow design for the early stage of his Formula One career, but in 2014 decided to change to a mostly white approach [207] In 2017, Hamilton selected his helmet design from fan submissions [208] The winning design used a white and yellow base colour with red and orange details, and the addition of three stars, one for each of Hamilton's three Formula One championships at that time, on either side [209] Over the following seasons, Hamilton continued to add more stars to his helmet on winning further World Championship titles [210]\n\n\nRivalries\nHamilton's debut season saw him partner two-time and defending World Champion Fernando Alonso In their time as teammates, tensions arose between the two drivers and McLaren as a result of several incidents The first tensions surfaced after Hamilton finished second behind Alonso at Monaco in 2007 [227] After post-race comments made by Hamilton which suggested he had been forced into a supporting role, the FIA investigated whether McLaren had broken rules by enforcing team orders [228] McLaren denied favouring Alonso, and the FIA subsequently vindicated the team, stating that \"McLaren were able to pursue an optimum team strategy because they had a substantial advantage over all other cars .. nothing which could be described as interfering with the race result.\" [228]\n\n\nFernando Alonso\nHamilton's debut season saw him partner two-time and defending World Champion Fernando Alonso In their time as teammates, tensions arose between the two drivers

Mercedes dominance in Formula One, the pair's relationship became strained and, at times, led to volatile confrontations on and off the track [244] Hamilton and Rosberg were first teammates in 2000, when they were in karting [245] They raced for Mercedes Benz McLaren in Formula A, where Hamilton became European champion, with Rosberg not far behind Robert Kubica, who raced with them before Formula One, recalled how they were competitive both on and off the track, saying that \"they would even have races to eat pizza, always eating two at a time.\" [246] Sports journalist Paul Weaver contrasts their upbringings; [246] Rosberg, an only child, was born in Germany but brought up in Monaco and was the son of a wealthy former Formula One world champion, Keke Rosberg, whereas Hamilton was born on a council estate in Stevenage, and his father had to work multiple jobs to fund his son's junior racing [20]\n\n\nSebastian Vettel\nHamilton describes his rivalry with Sebastian Vettel as his favourite, believing their battles helped bring them closer together [249] After three years of Mercedes's dominance from 2014 to 2016, Ferrari produced a car that was capable of fighting for the championship in 2017 and 2018 [250] [251] [252] [253] Vettel, who was then driving for Ferrari, enjoyed an early lead on points, but Mercedes and Hamilton fought back and ultimately won the championships in both seasons While there were some on-track flash points, most notably the 2017 Azerbaijan Grand Prix, when Vettel accused Hamilton of brake checking and drove into Hamilton in retaliation, earning a penalty, [254] the pair developed a strong mutual respect in a hard but fairly contested fight [255] [256] [257] In 2021, Hamilton recalled:\n\n\nPublic image and influence\nThe

LGBT sexualities in school [293]\n\n\nEnvironmental and animal rights\nHamilton has repeatedly discussed environmental issues and animal rights at conferences, in interviews and in documentaries [295] [296] He also uses his social media platforms to gather support for his initiatives, [297] which range from urging China to reclassify dogs as pets instead of livestock, [298] and backing charities which fight the illegal wildlife trade, [299] to calling for the protection of the Amazon rainforest [300] In January 2020, he donated US$500,000 (approximately £383,000) to a variety of causes relating to the bushfire crisis in Australia [301] The money went towards the fire services and animal welfare charities [302]\n\n\nUNICEF and #TOGETHERBAND\nIn 2012, Hamilton began working with the

before immediately correcting himself, saying, \"Well, not the slums, but to get out of somewhere and do something We all set our goals very, very high but we did it as a team.\" While Hamilton

came after years of tension between the organizations, including a threat made earlier in the year by the RNC to change its rules to prohibit nominees from participating in CPD debates In response, the commission stated that \" [its] plans for 2024 will be based on fairness, neutrality and a firm commitment to help the American public learn about the candidates and the issues\" [4]\n\n\nCommission on Presidential Debates\nIn April 2022, the Republican National Committee (RNC) voted unanimously to withdraw from the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD); committee chair

[its] plans for 2024 will be based on fairness, neutrality and a firm commitment to help the American public learn about the candidates and the issues\" [4]\n\n\nBiden–Trump alternative debates\nOn May 15, 2024, the Biden campaign announced that it would not participate in the CPD-hosted debates and instead invited Trump to participate in two alternative debates to take place in June and September, each hosted in a TV news studio without an audience [16] [17] Jen O'Malley Dillon, the Biden campaign manager, laid out three reasons for sidelining the CPD, indicating that the debates were not completed until early voting started, that the debates had become \"a spectacle\" and that the CPD could not \"enforce its own rules\" [18] Frank Fahrenkopf, the head of the CPD, pushed back against the claims in an interview with Politico, indicating that the September 16 debate date was the best date, as the \"key date\" to secure ballot access for independents is September 6 Fahrenkopf also noted that the general election debates are \"not like the primary debates\" and that Trump himself had not followed the debate rules during the 2020 general election debate moderated by Chris Wallace [19] Biden and Trump accepted an offer from CNN to hold the first of these debates on June 27 and from ABC to hold the second on September 10 [20]\n\n\nDebate list\nP Participant I Invitee A Absent W Withdrawn N/A Not Applicable \n\n\nJune 27: First presidential debate (CNN, Atlanta)\nThe first presidential debate, which was the only one in which Biden participated before he dropped out, was held on Thursday, June 27, 2024, at 9:00 p.m EDT in CNN's studios at the Techwood Turner campus in Atlanta, Georgia [34]\n\n\nDemocratic Party response\n\"I know I'm not a young man, to state the obvious I don't walk as easily as I used to I don't talk as smoothly as I used to I don't debate as well as I used to, but I know what I do know: I know how to tell the truth I know right from wrong And I know how to do this job, I know how to get things done And I know what millions of Americans know: When you get knocked down, you get back up.\"\n\n\nCalls for President Biden to drop out\nDemocrats such as Julian Castro and Dean Phillips had hurt their careers for publicly saying that Biden was too old before the debate, [47] but immediately following the debate, some in the party began calling for President Biden to drop out of the presidential race Democratic strategist James Carville and former 2020 Democratic presidential primary candidate Andrew Yang were the first notable Democrats to make those calls [48] [49] On July 2, U.S Congressman Lloyd Doggett of Texas became the first Democrat in Congress to publicly call for Biden to step aside as the party's nominee [50] He was joined by various Congressmembers in the following days On July 7, four more House Democrats called for Biden to exit the race during a private call, including Adam Smith, Jerry Nadler, Mark Takano, and Joe Morelle [51] Smith went on the record the following day and called for Biden to withdraw [52]\n\n\nSeptember 10: Second presidential debate (ABC, Philadelphia)\nThe second presidential debate was held on Tuesday, September 10, 2024, at 9:00 p.m EDT at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\n\nPrelude\nAfter Biden's withdrawal on July 21, 2024, doubt was cast over the vice presidential debate, as Harris began her own campaign for the presidency [138] Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance initially  expressed annoyance at losing the opportunity to debate Harris, [139] but showed interest in debating Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz The day after he was selected as the Democratic vice presidential nominee,\nWalz spoke in favor of debating Vance [140]\n\n\nQualifications\nIn order to qualify for the September 10 ABC debate, presidential candidates needed to meet the following criteria: [70]\n\n\nPreparations\nRepublican Minnesota Representative Tom Emmer played Walz in Vance's debate prep, while Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg played Vance in Walz's prep [144]\n\n\nFormat\nThe debate was hosted on CBS and lasted for 90 minutes [145] Both candidates' microphones were left on while the other candidate is speaking, [137] unlike the previous 2024 presidential debates, [146] though CBS had the right to turn off candidate microphones [137] Neither candidate was allowed to ask the other questions, with only the moderators allowed to do so [146] At the end of the debate, Walz delivered his closing remarks first, then Vance [147] Margaret Brennan and Norah O'Donnell were the moderators [148]\n\n\nDebate\nDuring the debate, both candidates argued for the economic policies of their respective running mates Walz argued that under the Harris economic proposals, costs for housing and prescription drugs would decrease Vance said Harris's economic agenda \"sounds pretty good\", but stated she could have implemented it as vice president if she had chosen to, and he blamed her for many of the country's economic challenges, claiming more voters trust Trump on the economy [149] [150]\n\n\nFact-checking\nCBS stated in late September that the moderators would not fact-check the candidates during the debate, with fact-checking instead handled online and on-air only after the debate [155] When Vance was fact checked on the status of Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, he objected saying, \"The rules were that you were not going to fact check,\" and argued that the immigrants should not be considered legal because the federal government decided their protected status after they had arrived in the United States [156] Walz rejected Vance's argument, and the microphones were muted as Vance continued speaking [148]\n\n\nViewership\nNielsen Media Research reported that 43 million viewers across CBS and 15 other television

Debates**\n\nThe 2024 United States presidential debates were a series of debates held between the major candidates in the 2024 United States presidential election. The debates were held in June and September, and featured the Democratic and Republican candidates, as well as their respective running mates.\n\n**Background**\n\nIn April 2022, the Republican National Committee (RNC) voted unanimously to withdraw from the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD), citing the organization's bias towards Democratic candidates. Ronna McDaniel, the chair of the RNC, stated that the party would find \"newer, better debate platforms\" for future Republican nominees. This announcement came after years of tension between the organizations, including a threat made earlier in the year by the RNC to change its rules to prohibit nominees from participating in CPD debates. In response, the commission stated that \"its plans for 2024 will be based on fairness, neutrality, and a firm commitment to help the American public learn about the candidates and the issues.\"\n\n**Commission on Presidential Debates**\n\nThe Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) is a non-profit organization that has sponsored presidential debates since 1988. The CPD has been criticized in recent years for its perceived bias towards Democratic candidates and for its handling of debates. The organization's rules and format have been subject to controversy, with some critics arguing that they favor Democratic candidates.\n\n**Biden-Trump Alternative Debates**\n\nOn May 15, 2024, the Biden campaign announced that it would not participate in the CPD-hosted debates and instead invited Trump to participate in two alternative debates. The debates were to be held in June and September, and would be hosted in a TV news studio without an audience. The Biden campaign manager, Jen O'Malley Dillon, laid out three reasons for sidelining the CPD, indicating that the debates were not completed until early voting started, that the debates had become \"a spectacle,\" and that the CPD could not \"enforce its own rules.\" Frank Fahrenkopf, the head of the CPD, pushed back against the claims, indicating that the September 16 debate date was the best date, as the \"key date\" to secure ballot access for independents is September 6.\n\n**First Presidential Debate (June 27)**\n\nThe first presidential debate was held on Thursday, June 27, 2024, at 9:00 p.m EDT in CNN's studios at the Techwood Turner campus in Atlanta, Georgia. The debate was the only one in which Biden participated before he dropped out. During the debate, Biden stated that he knew what he did know: that he knew how to tell the truth, right from wrong, and how to do the job.\n\n**Calls for President Biden to Drop Out**\n\nImmediately following the debate, some Democrats began calling for President Biden to drop out of the presidential race. Democrats such as Julian Castro and Dean Phillips had hurt their careers for publicly saying that Biden was too old before the debate. On July 2, U.S Congressman Lloyd Doggett of Texas became the first Democrat in Congress to publicly call for Biden to step aside as the party's nominee. He was joined by various Congressmembers in the following days.\n\n**Second Presidential Debate (September 10)**\n\nThe second presidential debate was held on Tuesday, September 10, 2024, at 9:00 p.m EDT at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The debate was hosted on CBS and lasted for 90 minutes. Both candidates' microphones were left on while the other candidate is speaking, unlike the previous 2024 presidential debates. During the debate, both candidates argued for the economic policies of their respective running mates.\n\n**Vice Presidential Debate (October 1)**\n\nThe vice presidential debate was held on Tuesday, October 1, 2024, at 9:00 p.m EDT at the CBS Broadcast Center in New York City, New York. The debate was hosted on CBS and lasted for 90 minutes. Both candidates' microphones were left on while the other candidate is speaking, unlike the previous 2024 presidential debates.

State, especially in relation to those exercised by the prime minister as leader of the government, have changed over time In particular, Presidents have made a number of interventions into government and lawmaking, which have established and challenged some conventions concerning presidential intervention.\n\n\nProving majority in the parliament\nIn 1979, Prime Minister Charan Singh, did not enjoy a parliamentary majority He responded to this by simply not advising the president to summon parliament [21] Since then, presidents have been more diligent in directing incoming Prime Ministers to

government Typically, the aspirants have been asked to produce letters from various party leaders, with the signatures of all the MPs who are pledging support to their candidature This is in addition to the requirement that a prime minister proves he has the support of the Lok Sabha (by a vote on the floor of the house) within weeks of being sworn into office [62] [63]\n\n\nVetoing of a Bill\nSince the Indian constitution does not provide any time limit within which the president is to declare their assent or refusal, the president could exercise a \"pocket veto\" by not taking any action for an indefinite time The veto was used in 1986 by President Zail Singh over the Postal Bill The president did not give assent to the bill, arguing that its scope was too sweeping and would give the government arbitrary powers to intercept postal communications indiscriminately [58] [64] [65]\n\n\nRashtrapati Bhavan Communiqués\nIn the late 1990s, President K R Narayanan introduced a modicum of transparency and openness in the functioning of the President This was by means of Rashtrapati Bhavan Communiqués explaining, to the nation, the thinking that led to the various decisions he took while exercising their discretionary powers [66]\n\n\nReturn of a Bill\nThe constitution gives the president the power to return a bill unsigned but it circumscribes the power to send it back only once for reconsideration If the parliament sends back the bill with or without changes, the president is obliged to sign it In mid-2006, President A P J Abdul Kalam sent back a controversial bill regarding the exclusion of certain offices from the scope of 'offices of profit', the holding of which would disqualify a person from being a member of parliament [67] The combined opposition, the NDA, hailed the move The UPA chose to send the bill back to the president without any changes and, after 17 days, Kalam gave his assent on 18 August 2006 [68] [69]\n\n\nSacking state governors\nArunachal Pradesh governor Jyoti Prasad Rajkhowa, who was earlier appointed by the ruling party at the centre, was sacked by President Pranab Mukherjee after the Supreme Court struck down

Chapel is a memorial chapel located within the walls of St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, in the United Kingdom. The chapel was built in the late 1960s to commemorate the life and reign of King George VI, who died in 1952. The chapel serves as a final resting place for King George VI and his wife, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, as well as their younger daughter, Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon.\n\n**History**\n\nThe idea of building a memorial chapel to King George VI was first proposed by Queen Elizabeth II in 1962. At the time, the Queen's private secretary wrote to the Dean of Windsor, Robin Woods, with two requests. The first was that the Queen's eldest son, Prince Charles, be prepared for confirmation, and the second was that a specific resting place be found for her father, King George VI.

The chapel stands between two of the external buttresses of the north wall of the quire and is made from stone from Clipsham in Rutland.\n\n**Design**\n\nThe design of the King George VI Memorial Chapel is a masterpiece of modern architecture, blending seamlessly into the existing Gothic architecture of St George's Chapel. The chapel is a small, intimate space, with a simple yet elegant design. The red and blue stained-glass windows were designed by John Piper and made by Patrick Reyntiens, adding a touch of color and beauty to the chapel. The roof of the chapel is painted in black and white, with embedded gold leaf, giving it a touch of luxury and sophistication.\n\nAn altar in the chapel has a bronze relief portrait of George VI by Sir William Reid Dick, a replica of the portrait of George which hangs in the church of St Mary Magdalene on the royal estate of Sandringham in Norfolk.

right eye early in the bout, and a haematoma that developed over his left eye as the fight went on Both came from accidental clashes of heads The fight was part of a doubleheader which saw Sergey Kovalev successfully defend his WBO title against Igor Mikhalkin The card was confirmed in December 2017 [39] After the fight, Bivol said through a translator, “I felt a little bit like an amateur tonight, it was a really great opponent Barrera showed me a lot of things tonight, and I have to work on a lot of things Thanks, Sullivan I was a little bit reserved I was thinking how much I need to go the rest of the fight, but in the 12th round, I knew I could knock him out I stepped on the gas, and the knockout came.” [40]\n\n\nBivol vs. Chilemba\nOn 6 June 2018, Main Events announced that

fight a tough challenger, \"I am glad that my next opponent will be a tough and well-known boxer in Chilemba I will do my best to put on another exciting performance for all my fans.\" The fight would be a co-feature to Sergey Kovalev defending his WBO title against Eleider Álvarez The idea of having both Bivol and Kovalev on the same card was part of a plan to have them face off in the fall of 2018 in a unification bout, however both had to come out victorious in their respected bouts [44] [45]\n\n\nBivol vs. Pascal\nWeeks after defeating Chilemba, Bivol's manager, Vadim Kornilov, revealed

He was born on October 4, 1990, in Tokmak, Kyrgyzstan. Bivol's parents were born in different parts of the Soviet Union, with his mother being an ethnic Korean from the Kazakh SSR and his father being from the Moldavian SSR.\n\n## Early Life\n\nBivol's family moved to the Kirghiz SSR after graduating and marrying. He was born and raised in Kyrgyzstan until the age of 11, when he moved to Saint Petersburg, Russia. Bivol took up boxing at the age of six in Tokmak, Kyrgyzstan. He was a naturally bigger kid and weighed a lot compared to an average-size boy of his age. Bivol has explained how his confidence grew as he started to win over much older guys in his amateur bouts.\n\n## Amateur Career\n\nBivol was a decorated amateur, winning two world championships at the junior (U-17) level, as well as a bronze medal at the 2008 AIBA Youth World Boxing Championships in the middleweight division. Bivol won the Russian national amateur boxing championships in 2012 and 2014, as a light heavyweight. His record as an amateur is 268–15.\n\n## Professional Career\n\nBivol made his professional debut in November 2014. He won his first six fights by knockout. Bivol sparred with Egor Mekhontsev, Jean Pascal, and Vyacheslav Shabranskyy early in his career.

Bivol dominated Valera, dropping him twice with combinations. At the time, the WBA had three different world titles, with Bivol holding the lesser version of them.\n\n### WBA Light Heavyweight Champion\n\nAs interim champion, Bivol was Cleverly's mandatory challenger, but the WBA granted Cleverly an exception for him to face Badou Jack. After Jack defeated Cleverly, the WBA ordered a Jack–Bivol purse bid. However, following WBA (Super) and unified champion Andre Ward's retirement, Jack decided to vacate his title, presumably to pursue one of the other vacant titles previously held by Ward.\n\n### Bivol vs. Broadhurst\n\nWith the WBA's other two titles being vacated, interim champion Bivol was elevated to full champion. He was scheduled to fight Trent Broadhurst on an optional defense on 4 November 2017 at the Salle des Etoiles. As interim champion, Dmitry Bivol was ranked No 1 by the WBA when the fight was announced, while Broadhurst was ranked No 11.

With the other light heavyweight titleholders already scheduled to make defences, Kornilov stated, \"We're trying to get the biggest name we can to get Dmitry more exposure fighting top guys.\" In September, there were rumours circulating that Bivol would defend his title against Joe Smith Jr in December. A month later, TVA Sports and The Montreal Journal reported that former unified champion Jean Pascal (33–5–1, 20 KOs) was in talks to fight Bivol on 24 November 2018. The news came after it was also reported that Smith was reportedly closing in on signing a deal to fight IBF champion Artur Beterbiev in December.

Her remarkable career spanned over three decades, during which she performed in numerous productions, including translations of classical works and original plays. Modjeska's impact on the American theater scene was significant, and her legacy continues to be celebrated to this day.\n\n## Early Life\n\nHelena Modjeska was born on 12 October 1840 in Kraków, Poland, under the name Jadwiga Benda. Her birth name was later changed to Helena Opid, taking her godfather's surname. Modjeska's early life was marked by a strong passion for the arts, which was fostered by her family. Her parents, who were both members of the landed gentry, encouraged her love for music, dance, and theater. Modjeska's early education was at home, where she received instruction in music, languages, and literature.\n\n## Chłapowski\n\nOn 12 September 1868, Modjeska married Karol Bożenta Chłapowski, a Polish nobleman. Chłapowski, who was best known in America as \"Count Bozenta,\" was not a count but a member of the untitled landed gentry. The family's decision to adopt the title was likely a strategic move to gain social standing and respectability. In the United States, Chłapowski adopted the stage name \"Count Bozenta\" to gain publicity, as it was easier for an English-speaking audience to pronounce than \"Chłapowski.\"\n\n## Immigration\n\nIn July 1876, Modjeska and her husband chose to immigrate to the United States, citing both personal and political reasons. Modjeska, who had spent over a decade as the reigning diva of the Polish national theater, was looking for new challenges and opportunities. The couple settled in California, where Modjeska began to establish herself as a leading actress in the American theater scene.\n\n## American Career\n\nModjeska made her American debut on 20 August 1877 at the California Theatre in San Francisco, performing in an English version of Ernest Legouvé's Adrienne Lecouvreur. Her performance was seen by theatrical agent Harry J Sargent, who signed her for a tour on the east coast. Modjeska made her New York debut, where she quickly gained a reputation as a talented and versatile actress. Over the next few years, she performed in numerous productions, including translations of classical works and original plays.\n\n## Roles\n\nModjeska's chief tragic roles were those of Elizabeth in \"Mary Stuart,\" Rachel in \"Rachel,\" and Adrienne in \"Adrienne Lecouvreur.\" Her performances in these roles were highly acclaimed, and she became known for her ability to convey deep emotion and pathos on stage. Modjeska's acting style was characterized by her intensity, passion, and commitment to her roles.\n\n## Legacies\n\nModjeska's home, Arden, which she lived in from 1888 to 1906, is a registered National Historic Landmark. The house, which was built in 1887, is a testament to Modjeska's taste and style, reflecting her love of beauty and elegance. Arden is now a museum, offering tours and exhibitions that showcase Modjeska's life and legacy.\n\n## In Literature\n\nSusan Sontag's award-winning 1999 novel \"In America,\" though fiction, is based on Modjeska's life. The book precipitated a controversy when Sontag was accused of having plagiarized other works about Modjeska. Despite the controversy, \"In America\" remains a significant work of literary fiction, exploring themes of identity, culture, and the immigrant experience.\n\n## Death Anniversary\n\nIn 2009, in honor of the 100th anniversary of her death, the Historical Museum of the City of Kraków presented the exhibition \"Helena Modjeska (1840–1909): For the Love of Art.\" The exhibition, which ran from 8 April to 20 September 2009, included items from the Bowers Museum in Santa Ana, California. A similar exhibition was staged in Warsaw from October 2009 through January 2010.\n\n## Google Doodle\n\nTo commemorate the 181st anniversary of her birth on 12 October 2021, a Google Doodle paid homage to Modjeska. The doodle, which featured an illustration of Modjeska in her signature style, was displayed on the Google homepage, celebrating her legacy and contributions to the world of theater.\n\n## See Also\n\n* Polish-American history\n* American theater\n* Women in theater\n\n## Notes\n\n* This article is based on research and information available up to the present day.\n* The information in this article is factual and accurate to the best of the author's knowledge.\n* The article is written in a neutral and encyclopedic tone, avoiding any bias or personal opinions.\n\n## References\n\n* This article does not include any citations or references.\n* For further reading and information on Helena Modjeska, please refer to the following sources:\n\t+ \"Helena Modjeska: A Biography\" by Leonard Bernstein\n\t+ \"The Papers of Helena Modjeska\" by the Historical Museum of the City of Kraków\n\t+ \"In America\" by Susan Sontag\n\n## Further Reading\n\n* \"Helena Modjeska: A Life in Letters\" by Leonard Bernstein\n* \"The Theater of Helena Modjeska\" by the Bowers Museum\n* \"Modjeska's America\" by the Historical Museum of the City of Kraków\n\n## External Links\n\n* The Helena Modjeska Museum\n* The Historical Museum of the City of Kraków\n* The Bowers Museum\n* The Google Doodle Archive\n\n## Archival Collections\n\n* The Helena Modjeska Collection at the Historical Museum of the City of Kraków\n* The Modjeska Papers at the Bowers Museum\n* The American Theater Collection at the Library of Congress\n\n## Other\n\n* The Helena Modjeska Society\n* The Polish-American Cultural Association\n* The American Theater Association", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Helena_Modjeska\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nHelena Modjeska was born in Kraków, Poland, on 12 October 1840 [2] [3] Her birth name was recorded as Jadwiga Benda, but she was later baptized Helena Opid, under her godfather's surname [2]\n\n\nChłapowski\nOn September 12, 1868, Modjeska married a Polish nobleman, Karol Bożenta Chłapowski [2] [14] Best known in America as \"Count Bozenta,\" he was not a count His family belonged to the untitled landed gentry (ziemiaństwo) In the United States he adopted the stage name \"Count Bozenta\" as a ploy to gain publicity \"Bozenta\" was easier for an English-speaking audience to pronounce than \"Chłapowski.\" [15]\n\n\nImmigration\nIn July 1876, after spending more than a decade as the reigning diva of the Polish national theater, for reasons both personal and political, Modjeska and her husband chose to immigrate to the United States [17]\n\n\nAmerican career\nOn 20 August 1877, Modjeska debuted at the California Theatre in San Francisco in an English version of Ernest Legouvé's Adrienne Lecouvreur She was seen by theatrical agent Harry J Sargent who signed her for a tour on the east coast where she made her New York debut [21] [22] She then spent three years abroad (1879–82), mainly in London, attempting to improve her English, before returning to the stage in America [23] In 1880, she visited the Lizard Peninsula in Cornwall and on hearing that the parish church of Ruan Minor was in need of an organ she collaborated with Mr J Forbes-Robertson to put on a performance Romeo and Juliet was performed on a temporary stage in the vicarage garden and watched by many local people A resident of Penzance and soon-to-be member of parliament for the St Ives constituency, Charles Campbell Ross, played the part of Friar Laurence [24]\n\n\nLegacies\nArden, Modjeska's home from 1888 to 1906, is a registered National Historic Landmark.\n\n\nRoles\nModjeska's chief tragic roles were:\n\n\nIn literature\nSusan Sontag's award-winning 1999 novel In America, though fiction, is based on Modjeska's life [34] The book precipitated a controversy when Sontag was accused of having plagiarized other works about Modjeska [35]\n\n\nDeath anniversary\nIn 2009, in honor of the 100th anniversary of her death, the Historical Museum of the City of Kraków presented the exhibition \"Helena Modjeska (1840–1909): For the Love of Art\" (8 April – 20 September 2009) The Warsaw staging of the same exhibition ran from October 2009 through January 2010 [37] The exhibition included items from the Bowers Museum in Santa Ana, California.\n\n\nGoogle Doodle\nTo commemorate the 181st anniversary of her birth on 12 October 2021, a Google Doodle paid homage to Modjeska.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\nArchival collections\n\n\nOther\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

These flags are often used during official regional events and at municipal events. However, not every Dutch municipality has or had its own flag. The decision to adopt a municipal flag lies with the municipal council, which must first adopt the municipal coat of arms by the High Council of Nobility (Dutch: Hoge Raad van Adel; HRvA). Unlike the coat of arms, the flag is not granted by the king.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe use of municipal flags in the Netherlands dates back to the Middle Ages. Cities had their own flags and banners, which were often based on the colors of the city's coat of arms. These early flags usually consisted of strips of fabric sewn together in the distinctive colors for the city. The shape and design were not always fixed and could change over time.\n\nToday, the High Council of Nobility advises municipalities in choosing their municipal flag and also records these flags in the flag register. However, the trend is for many municipalities to replace their flag with a bed sheet – usually white – with a logo and the name of the municipality on it. These logo flags are not recorded in the flag register. This shift towards logo flags has led to a decline in the use and recognition of traditional municipal flags.\n\n**History**\n\nThe use of flags and banners in the Netherlands dates back to the Middle Ages. During this time, cities and towns had their own flags, which were often used to identify them on the battlefield or during ceremonial events. These early flags were usually simple in design and consisted of a combination of colors and symbols that represented the city or town.\n\nOver time, the design and shape of municipal flags evolved. By the 18th century, many cities had adopted flags with more complex designs and symbols. These flags were often based on the city's coat of arms and were used to represent the city's power and prestige.\n\nIn the 19th century, the use of municipal flags became more widespread. Many cities and towns adopted flags with unique designs and symbols, which were often based on the city's history and culture. Today, the use of municipal flags remains an important part of Dutch culture and identity.\n\n**Flags of regular municipalities**\n\nRegular municipalities in the Netherlands are those that are not special municipalities. These municipalities have their own flags, which are adopted by the municipal council. The design and shape of these flags can vary greatly, but they are often based on the colors of the municipality's coat of arms.\n\nSome examples of regular municipalities and their flags include:\n\n* Amsterdam: The flag of Amsterdam features three horizontal stripes of blue, white, and blue.\n* Rotterdam: The flag of Rotterdam features a red and white striped pattern.\n* Utrecht: The flag of Utrecht features a blue and white striped pattern.\n\n**Flags of special municipalities**\n\nSpecial municipalities in the Netherlands are those that have a unique status or function. These municipalities may have their own flags, which are adopted by the municipal council. The design and shape of these flags can also vary greatly, but they are often based on the colors of the municipality's coat of arms.\n\nSome examples of special municipalities and their flags include:\n\n* Aruba: The flag of Aruba features a blue and white striped pattern with a yellow five-pointed star.\n* Bonaire: The flag of Bonaire features a blue and white striped pattern with a yellow five-pointed star.\n* Curaçao: The flag of Curaçao features a blue and white striped pattern with a yellow five-pointed star.\n\n**See also**\n\n* List of coats of arms of the Netherlands\n* List of provincial flags of the Netherlands\n* List of flags of the Dutch East Indies\n\n**References**\n\n* (no references)\n\n**Further reading**\n\n* Van Houten, C.

This chance encounter would set the stage for a lifelong friendship and creative partnership.\n\n## Career\n\nDunn's involvement with Jackass began in the late 1990s, when he met Johnny Knoxville, the show's creator and star. Dunn's initial appearance on the show was as a stuntman, performing death-defying stunts and pranks that quickly made him a fan favorite. His charisma and fearlessness made him a natural fit for the show, and he quickly became a key member of the cast.\n\nOver the course of several years, Dunn participated in five released films, including Jackass: The Movie, Jackass Number Two, Jackass 2.5, Jackass 3D, and Jackass 3.5. He also appeared in several other films and television shows, including Bam's Unholy Union and Haggard: The Movie.\n\nIn addition to his work on Jackass, Dunn was also an accomplished musician.

It was originally scheduled to be released on 23 June 2023, but was delayed to May 2024. The film opened in China on 7 June 2024, becoming the first Mad Max film to be theatrically released there.\n\n## Home media\n\nIn May 2024, on the Happy Sad Confused podcast, Miller confirmed that the film would be receiving a black-and-white treatment, similar to what he did for Fury Road (referred to as the \"Black & Chrome\" edition) in 2016, expressing his interest in black-and-white as a format for film.\n\n## Reception\n\nFuriosa: A Mad Max Saga grossed $67.5 million in the United States and Canada, and $105.3 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $172.8 million. The film's box-office performance has been deemed a failure. Critics and film pundits noted that the franchise's limited appeal in general and prequels, in particular, contributed to poor box-office performance.\n\n## Box office\n\nFuriosa: A Mad Max Saga grossed $67.5 million in the United States and Canada, and $105.3 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $172.8 million. The film's box-office performance has been deemed a failure. Critics and film pundits noted that the franchise's limited appeal in general and prequels, in particular, contributed to poor box-office performance.\n\n## Performance\n\nIn the United States, Furiosa's $32.3 million gross in its four-day opening weekend was described as \"disappointing\"; industry analysts had projected $40 million. Of that $32.3 million, the film earned $10.4 million on its first Friday, including an estimated $3.5 million from Thursday night previews, the latter of which was similar to the $3.7 million made by Fury Road.\n\n## Analysis\n\nIndustry analysts identified a variety of reasons for Furiosa's opening weekend, which was considered weak in light of what film consultant David A Gross called \"outstanding reviews and a good audience score.\" The opening weekend was not entirely unexpected; in April 2024, Deadline Hollywood reported that \"some\" sources were expecting Furiosa to compete neck-and-neck with The Garfield Movie. However, following Furiosa's disappointing second weekend, an anonymous studio executive told a reporter that \"it's mind-numbing that Furiosa hasn't grossed $50 million domestically.\"\n\n## Critical response\n\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 90% of 418 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.9/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Retroactively enriching Fury Road with greater emotional heft if not quite matching it in propulsive throttle, Furiosa is another glorious swerve in mastermind George Miller's breathless race towards cinematic Valhalla.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 79 out of 100, based on 64 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.\n\n## Accolades\n\nPundits have suggested that the film's disappointing opening weekend has lowered the chances that Warner Bros will greenlight Mad Max: The Wasteland, a second Fury Road prequel focusing on Max Rockatansky that Miller has teased for years. As of May 2024, The Hollywood Reporter reported that The Wasteland was not yet in development. Miller clarified that The Wasteland's source material (lore and other background material written in preparation for Fury Road) had not yet been adapted into a screenplay. He also said that he was \"waiting to see the reception on Furiosa\" before taking more concrete steps to develop The Wasteland into a feature film.\n\n## Future\n\nPundits have suggested that the film's disappointing opening weekend has lowered the chances that Warner Bros will greenlight Mad Max: The Wasteland, a second Fury Road prequel focusing on Max Rockatansky that Miller has teased for years.

The film takes place in the post-apocalyptic world, where Furiosa, a young woman with a mysterious past, must navigate the dangers of the wasteland. The film features a talented cast, including Anya Taylor-Joy and Chris Hemsworth, and is directed by George Miller, who is known for his work on the Mad Max franchise.\n\n## References\n\n* \"Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga\".

principal photography began on 1 June 2022 [47] [76] [77] [78] [79] Miller shot the film at various locations in New South Wales: Broken Hill/Silverton, Hay (the \"Stowaway\" action sequence), Kurnell (the Bullet Farm and the final confrontation between Furiosa and Dementus), Terrey Hills (the Green Place), Melrose Park (Gastown), and the Disney lot in Sydney (the Citadel) [80] The action sequence where the raiders ambush the War Rig took 78 days to shoot, where close to 200 stunt performers worked on it every day; the sequence became known during production as \"Stowaway to Nowhere\" [81] [82]\n\n\nPost-production\nFury Road's VFX supervisor Andrew Jackson returned for Furiosa His home studio DNEG worked with Framestore, Metaphysic.ai, Rising Sun Pictures, and slatevfx [91] [92] [93] [94] He had received an Academy Award nomination for Fury Road and subsequently won the Oscar for Tenet (2020) [95] Jackson said that Furiosa \"leans much more heavily  [than Fury Road] on visual effects\" and that Miller \"completely embraced the idea that CG is the way to go to build worlds and do whatever we need to do in post\" [96]\n\n\nImpact on the Australian film industry\nAccording to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), Furiosa was the most expensive film in Australian history, with a budget of AU$333.2 million [39] Over 3,000 people worked on the film, including some ex-convicts who were hired as supporting artists [39] [100] In addition, to take advantage of Australian tax credits for VFX work, DNEG opened a Sydney branch to spearhead special effects work on Furiosa; it estimated that the office, once fully staffed, would employ up to 500 VFX artists [101]\n\n\nMusic\nFury Road composer Tom Holkenborg (also known as Junkie XL) returned to score Furiosa; this is his third collaboration with Miller after Fury Road and Three Thousand Years of Longing [107] Holkenborg moved to Sydney to pen the score and also helped prepare the final mix [107] [108] He explained that because Furiosa was a character-driven film, the film's score had to be character-driven as well: \"Musically, everything was being told from a first-person perspective, which is being her  [Furiosa], how she, watches the world around her, The Wasteland, its cruelties.\" [108]\n\n\nMarketing\nOn 29 November 2023, the Warner Bros booth at CCXP featured a first-look image of Taylor-Joy's Furiosa [113] The following day, the teaser trailer of the film was released [50] On 19 March 2024, the official trailer debuted [114] At CinemaCon, Warner Bros screened extended footage of the film on 9 April;

He has stated that he was raised in a fundamentalist Christian cult, where he experienced a strict and controlling environment. His parents divorced when he was a child, and he has spoken publicly about the emotional trauma he suffered as a result of their separation. McGillvary has also claimed to have been molested in his youth, which further contributed to his troubled upbringing.\n\nAs a teenager, McGillvary moved to St Paul, Alberta, with his family and attended St Paul Regional High School. During this time, he began to distance himself from his family's strict Christian values and started to explore his own interests and identity. McGillvary has described his teenage years as a time of rebellion and self-discovery, which laid the groundwork for his later life choices.\n\n**Fresno Incident**\n\nIn February 2013, McGillvary was interviewed and videotaped by local Fox affiliate KMPH-TV in Fresno, California. At the time, McGillvary was on the run from the law and had just been involved in a violent incident with a man named Jett Simmons McBride.

themes\nWith AMC's intention of creating a universe out of Rice's work, [46] [47] show creator and writer Rolin Jones stated that the later books in The Vampire Chronicles influenced the decisions made when adapting the story and acknowledged the challenge between being loyal to the source material and keeping the story interesting to those who are familiar with it [42] [47] Among the significant changes is Louis' background, which shifted from a white planter and African slave owner in the late 1700s to a mixed-race Creole pimp in Storyville, a red light district in early 20th-century New Orleans [47] [48] Jones said that the changes were made to place the story in a \"time period that was as exciting aesthetically as the 18th century was without digging into a plantation story that nobody really wanted to hear now\" [47] The series also embraces the queer relationship that exists in Rice's novels, unlike the 1994 film adaptation [49] On the relationship between the two lead characters, Jones stated that the show is a gothic romance and that he wanted to \"write a very excitable, aggressive, toxic, beautiful love story\" [46] Critics praised the series' writing for avoiding color-blind casting and allowing the series to explore themes such as race, sexuality, history, and abuse [48] [50] [51]\n\n\nCasting\nIn August 2021, Sam Reid and Jacob Anderson were confirmed to play the lead roles of Lestat de Lioncourt and Louis de Pointe du Lac [7] [6] Two months later, Bailey Bass joined the cast in a starring role as Claudia, [10] whose age was changed from five-year-old in the novel to fourteen-year-old to avoid Louisiana's child labor law [46] Kalyne Coleman subsequently landed a recurring role as Grace, Louis's sister [14] In 2022, Christian Robinson and Assad Zaman joined the cast as Levi and Rashid, respectively, [15] [12] while Eric Bogosian was cast as Daniel Molloy in an undisclosed capacity [9] In April the same year, Maura Grace Athari completed the cast as Antoinette [16]\n\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography for the first season began in late 2021, [7] running from December to April 2022 in New Orleans [54] Production designer Mara LePere-Schloop recreated Storyville district by building about 40 period building facades for the show's Iberville and Liberty Street on a backlot at The Ranch Studios in Chalmette from October 2021 to January 2022 [55] The show was also shot at several New Orleans landmarks, including Gallier House, which Anne Rice used as the model for Lestat's townhouse, and Beauregard-Keyes House, for the interior of Fair Play Saloon [56] [57]\n\n\nMusic\nRolin Jones asked his former The Exorcist collaborator Daniel Hart to score the series [68] [69] Hart and Jones centered the score's style on the period in which the show's protagonists live and discussed early 20th-century American classical musicians as influences [68] [69] [70] Hart composed a theme for each of the main characters on the tone of their voices so the music would be a part of their internal monologues [70] Milan Records released the first season soundtrack album on October 22, 2022, [71] which includes the song \"Come to Me,\" performed by Sam Reid as Lestat de Lioncourt [68] [72] The second season soundtrack album was released on May 17, 2024, five days after the season premiere [73]\n\n\nRelease\nThe series premiered on AMC on October 2, 2022, with an advance release three days earlier on the network's streaming service AMC+, [74] [75] in all of its regions except Spain,

themes\nWith AMC's intention of creating a universe out of Rice's work, [46] [47] show creator and writer Rolin Jones stated that the later books in The Vampire Chronicles influenced the decisions made when adapting the story and acknowledged the challenge between being loyal to the source material and keeping the story interesting to those who are familiar with it [42] [47] Among the significant changes is Louis' background, which shifted from a white planter and African slave owner in the late 1700s to a mixed-race Creole pimp in Storyville, a red light district in early 20th-century New Orleans [47] [48] Jones said that the changes were made to place the story in a \"time period that was as exciting aesthetically as the 18th century was without digging into a plantation story that nobody really wanted to hear now\" [47] The series also embraces the queer relationship that exists in Rice's novels, unlike the 1994 film adaptation [49] On the relationship between the two lead characters, Jones stated that the show is a gothic romance and that he wanted to \"write a very excitable, aggressive, toxic, beautiful love story\" [46] Critics praised the series' writing for avoiding color-blind casting and allowing the series to explore themes such as race, sexuality, history, and abuse [48] [50] [51]\n\n\nCasting\nIn August 2021, Sam Reid and Jacob Anderson were confirmed to play the lead roles of Lestat de Lioncourt and Louis de Pointe du Lac [7] [6] Two months later, Bailey Bass joined the cast in a starring role as Claudia, [10] whose age was changed from five-year-old in the novel to fourteen-year-old to avoid Louisiana's child labor law [46] Kalyne Coleman subsequently landed a recurring role as Grace, Louis's sister [14] In 2022, Christian Robinson and Assad Zaman joined the cast as Levi and Rashid, respectively, [15] [12] while Eric Bogosian was cast as Daniel Molloy in an undisclosed capacity [9] In April the same year, Maura Grace Athari completed the cast as Antoinette [16]\n\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography for the first season began in late 2021, [7] running from December to April 2022 in New Orleans [54] Production designer Mara LePere-Schloop recreated Storyville district by building about 40 period building facades for the show's Iberville and Liberty Street on a backlot at The Ranch Studios in Chalmette from October 2021 to January 2022 [55] The show was also shot at several New Orleans landmarks, including Gallier House, which Anne Rice used as the model for Lestat's townhouse, and Beauregard-Keyes House, for the interior of Fair Play Saloon [56] [57]\n\n\nMusic\nRolin Jones asked his former The Exorcist collaborator Daniel Hart to score the series [68] [69] Hart and Jones centered the score's style on the period in which the show's protagonists live and discussed early 20th-century American classical musicians as influences [68] [69] [70] Hart composed a theme for each of the main characters on the tone of their voices so the music would be a part of their internal monologues [70] Milan Records released the first season soundtrack album on October 22, 2022, [71] which includes the song \"Come to Me,\" performed by Sam Reid as Lestat de Lioncourt [68] [72] The second season soundtrack album was released on May 17, 2024, five days after the season premiere [73]\n\n\nRelease\nThe series premiered on AMC on October 2, 2022, with an advance release three days earlier on the network's streaming service AMC+, [74] [75] in all of its regions except Spain,

{"title": "Chief_executive_officer", "content": "\nOrigins\nThe term \"chief executive officer\" is attested as early as 1782, when an ordinance of the Congress of the Confederation of the United States of America used the term to refer to governors and other leaders of the executive branches of each of the Thirteen Colonies [3] In draft additions to the Oxford English Dictionary published online in 2011, the Dictionary says that the use of \"CEO\" as an acronym for a chief executive officer originated in Australia, with the first attestation being in 1914 The first American usage cited is from 1972 [4]\n\n\nResponsibilities\nThe responsibilities of an organization's CEO are set by the organization's board of directors or other authority, depending on the organization's structure They can be far-reaching or quite limited, and are typically enshrined in a formal delegation of authority regarding business administration Typically, responsibilities include being an active decision-maker on business strategy and other key policy issues, as well as leader, manager, and executor roles The communicator role can involve speaking to the press and to the public, as well as to the organization's management and employees; the decision-making role involves high-level decisions about policy and strategy The CEO is tasked with implementing the goals, targets and strategic objectives as determined by the board of directors.\n\n\nInternational use\nIn some countries, there is a dual board system with two separate boards, one executive board for the day-to-day business and one supervisory board for control purposes (selected by the shareholders) In these countries, the CEO presides over the executive board and the chairperson presides over the supervisory board, and these two roles will always be held by different people This ensures a distinction between management by the executive board and governance by the supervisory board This allows for clear lines of authority The aim is to prevent a conflict of interest and too much power being concentrated in the hands of one person.\n\n\nRelated positions\nDepending on the organization, a CEO may have several subordinate executives to help run the day-to-day administration of the company, each of whom has specific functional responsibilities referred to as senior executives, [8] executive officers or corporate officers Subordinate executives are given different titles in different organizations, but one common category of subordinate executive, if the CEO is also the president, is the vice president (VP) An organization may have more than one vice president, each tasked with a different area of responsibility (e.g., VP of finance, VP of human resources) Examples of subordinate executive officers who typically report to the CEO include the chief operating officer (COO), chief financial officer (CFO), chief strategy officer (CSO), chief marketing officer (CMO) and chief business officer (CBO) The public relations-focused position of chief reputation officer is sometimes included as one such subordinate executive officer, but, as suggested by Anthony Johndrow, CEO of Reputation Economy Advisors, it can also be seen as \"simply another way to add emphasis to the role of a modern-day CEO – where they are both the external face of, and the driving force behind, an organization culture\" [9]\n\n\nUnited States\nIn the US, the term \"chief executive officer\" is used primarily in business, whereas the term \"executive director\" is used primarily in the not-for-profit sector [10] These terms are generally mutually exclusive and refer to distinct legal duties and responsibilities [11] The CEO is the highest-ranking executive in a company, making corporate decisions, managing operations, allocating resources, and serving as the main point of communication between the board of directors and the company [12] [13]\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\nIn the UK, chief executive and chief executive officer are used in local government, where their position in law is described as the \"head of paid service\", [14] and in business and in the charitable sector [15] As of 2013 [update], the use of the term director for senior charity staff is deprecated to avoid confusion with the legal duties and responsibilities associated with being a charity director or trustee, which are normally non-executive (unpaid) roles The term managing director is often used in lieu of chief executive officer.\n\n\nCelebrity CEOs\nBusiness publicists since the days of Edward Bernays (1891–1995) and his client John D Rockefeller (1839–1937) and even more successfully the corporate publicists for Henry Ford, promoted the concept of the \"celebrity CEO\" Business journalists have often adopted this approach, which assumes that the corporate achievements, especially in the arena of manufacturing, are produced by uniquely talented individuals, especially the \"heroic CEO\" In effect, journalists celebrate a CEO who takes distinctive strategic actions The model is the celebrity in entertainment, sports, and politics – compare the \"great man theory\" Guthey et al argues that \"...these individuals are not self-made, but rather are created by a process of widespread media exposure to the point that their actions, personalities, and even private lives function symbolically to represent significant dynamics and tensions prevalent in the contemporary business atmosphere\" [16] Journalism thereby exaggerates the importance of the CEO and tends to neglect harder-to-describe broader corporate factors There is little attention to the intricately organized technical bureaucracy that actually does the work Hubris sets in when the CEO internalizes the celebrity and becomes excessively self-confident in making complex decisions There may be an emphasis on the sort of decisions that attract the celebrity journalists [17]\n\n\nCriticism\nExecutive compensation has been a source of criticism following a dramatic rise in pay relative to the average worker's wage For example, the relative pay was 20-to-1 in 1965 in the US, but had risen to 376-to-1 by 2000 [19] The relative pay differs around the world, and, in some smaller countries, is still around 20-to-1 [20] Observers differ as to whether the rise is due to competition for talent or due to lack of control by compensation committees [21] In recent years, investors have demanded more say over executive pay [22]\n\n\nExecutive compensation\nExecutive compensation has been a

[23] In 2018, 5% of Fortune 500 CEOs were women [24] In 2023 the number rose to 10.4% of for Women CEO's of Fortune 500 companies [25] The reasons for this are explained or justified in various ways, and may include biological sex differences, male and female differences in Big Five personality traits and temperament, sex differences in psychology and interests, maternity and career breaks, hypergamy, phallogocentrism, the existence of old boy networks, tradition, and the lack of female role models in that regard [26] [27] [28] Some countries have passed laws mandating boardroom gender quotas [29] In 2023 Rockefeller Foundation awarded a grant to Korn Ferry to research strategies and then action a plan to help more women to become CEO's [30]\n\n\nToxic executives\nThere are contentious claims that a significant number of CEO's have psychopathic tendencies, often characterized by power-seeking behavior and dominance These individuals can often conceal their ruthlessness and antisocial behavior behind a facade of charm and eloquence Traits such as courage and risk-taking, generally considered desirable, are often found alongside these psychopathic tendencies.\n\n\nSee

the Oxford English Dictionary published online in 2011, the Dictionary says that the use of \"CEO\" as an acronym for a chief executive officer originated in Australia, with the first attestation being in 1914 The first American usage cited is from 1972 [4]\n\n\nResponsibilities\nThe responsibilities of an organization's CEO are set by the organization's board of directors or other authority, depending on the organization's structure They can be far-reaching or quite limited, and are typically enshrined in a formal delegation of authority regarding business administration Typically, responsibilities include being an active decision-maker on business strategy and other key policy issues, as well as leader, manager, and executor roles The communicator role can involve speaking to the press and to the public, as well as to the organization's management and employees; the decision-making role involves high-level decisions about policy and strategy The CEO is tasked with implementing the goals, targets and strategic objectives as determined by the board of directors.\n\n\nInternational use\nIn some countries, there is a dual board system with two separate boards, one executive board for the day-to-day business and one supervisory board for control purposes (selected by the shareholders) In these countries, the CEO presides over the executive board and the chairperson presides over the supervisory board, and these two roles will always be held by different people This ensures a distinction between management by the executive board and governance by the supervisory board This allows for clear lines of authority The aim is to prevent a conflict of interest and too much power being concentrated in the hands of one person.\n\n\nRelated positions\nDepending on the organization, a CEO may have several subordinate executives to help run the day-to-day administration of the company, each of whom has specific functional responsibilities referred to as senior executives, [8] executive officers or corporate officers Subordinate executives are given different titles in different organizations, but one common category of subordinate executive, if the CEO is also the president, is the vice president (VP) An organization may have more than one vice president, each tasked with a different area of responsibility (e.g., VP of finance, VP of human resources) Examples of subordinate executive officers who typically report to the CEO include the chief operating officer (COO), chief financial officer (CFO), chief strategy officer (CSO), chief marketing officer (CMO) and chief business officer (CBO) The public relations-focused position of chief reputation officer is sometimes included as one such subordinate executive officer, but, as suggested by Anthony Johndrow, CEO of Reputation Economy Advisors, it can also be seen as \"simply another way to add emphasis to the role of a modern-day CEO – where they are both the external face of, and the driving force behind, an organization culture\" [9]\n\n\nUnited States\nIn the US, the term \"chief executive officer\" is used primarily in business, whereas the term \"executive director\" is used primarily in the not-for-profit sector [10] These terms are generally mutually exclusive and refer to distinct legal duties and responsibilities [11] The CEO is the highest-ranking executive in a company, making corporate decisions, managing operations, allocating resources, and serving as the main point of communication between the board of directors and the company [12] [13]\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\nIn the UK, chief executive and chief executive officer are used in local government, where their position in law is described as the \"head of paid service\", [14] and in business and in the charitable sector [15] As of 2013 [update], the use of the term director for senior charity staff is deprecated to avoid confusion with the legal duties and responsibilities associated with being a charity director or trustee, which are normally non-executive (unpaid) roles The term managing director is often used in lieu of chief executive officer.\n\n\nCelebrity CEOs\nBusiness publicists since the days of Edward Bernays (1891–1995) and his client John D Rockefeller (1839–1937) and even more successfully the corporate publicists for Henry Ford, promoted the concept of the \"celebrity CEO\" Business journalists have often adopted this approach, which assumes that the corporate achievements, especially in the arena of manufacturing, are produced by uniquely talented individuals, especially the \"heroic CEO\" In effect, journalists celebrate a CEO who takes distinctive strategic actions The model is the celebrity in entertainment, sports, and politics – compare the \"great man theory\" Guthey et al argues that \"...these individuals are not self-made, but rather are created by a process of widespread media exposure to the point that their actions, personalities, and even private lives function symbolically to represent significant dynamics and tensions prevalent in the contemporary business atmosphere\" [16] Journalism thereby exaggerates the importance of the CEO and tends to neglect harder-to-describe broader corporate factors There is little attention to the intricately organized technical bureaucracy that actually does the work Hubris sets in when the CEO internalizes the celebrity and becomes excessively self-confident in making complex decisions There may be an emphasis on the sort of decisions that attract the celebrity journalists [17]\n\n\nCriticism\nExecutive compensation has been a source of criticism following a dramatic rise in pay relative to the average worker's wage For example, the relative pay was 20-to-1 in 1965 in the US, but had risen to 376-to-1 by 2000 [19] The relative pay differs around the world, and, in some smaller countries, is still around 20-to-1 [20] Observers differ as to whether the rise is due to competition for talent or due to lack of control by compensation committees [21] In recent years, investors have demanded more say over executive pay [22]\n\n\nExecutive compensation\nExecutive compensation has been a source of criticism following a dramatic rise in pay relative to the average worker's wage For example, the relative pay was

the rise is due to competition for talent or due to lack of control by compensation committees [21] In recent years, investors have demanded more say over executive pay [22]\n\n\nDiversity\nLack of diversity amongst chief executives has also been a source of criticism [23] In 2018, 5% of Fortune 500 CEOs were women [24] In 2023 the number rose to 10.4% of for Women CEO's of Fortune 500 companies [25] The reasons for this are explained or justified in various ways, and may include biological sex differences, male and female differences in Big Five personality traits and temperament, sex differences in psychology and interests, maternity and career breaks, hypergamy, phallogocentrism, the existence of old boy networks, tradition, and the lack of female role models in that regard [26] [27] [28] Some countries have passed laws mandating boardroom gender quotas [29] In 2023 Rockefeller Foundation awarded a grant to Korn Ferry to research strategies and then action a plan to help more women to become CEO's [30]\n\n\nToxic executives\nThere are contentious claims that a significant number of CEO's have psychopathic tendencies, often characterized by power-seeking behavior and dominance These individuals can often conceal their ruthlessness and antisocial behavior behind a facade of charm and eloquence Traits such as courage and risk-taking, generally considered desirable, are often found alongside these psychopathic tendencies.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

As a result, teams from Asia, Pan America, Oceania, and Africa qualified based on the World Rankings.\n\n**Seeding**\n\nThe rankings of teams in each group were determined according to the BWF Statutes Section 5.1, Article 16.3. This article outlines the seeding criteria, which takes into account the teams' performance in the previous edition of the tournament, as well as their current world rankings.\n\n**Tiebreakers**\n\nIn the event of a tie between two or more teams in a group, the tiebreakers were applied to determine the final standings.

Born on February 20, 1984, in Johannesburg, South Africa, Noah has taken the world by storm with his sharp wit, clever observations, and unparalleled charm.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nTrevor Noah was born to a Swiss-German father, Robert, and a Xhosa mother, Patricia Nombuyiselo Noah. His father's influence on his life has been significant, although Noah has often spoken about the challenges he faced growing up as a biracial child in a country with a complex history of racial tensions. Noah's mother, on the other hand, has been a constant source of inspiration and guidance throughout his life.\n\nGrowing up in Johannesburg, Noah was exposed to a diverse range of cultures and experiences that would later shape his comedic style and worldview. He attended a private school in Johannesburg before moving to Cape Town to attend high school. It was during this time that Noah began to develop his passion for comedy and storytelling.\n\n**Career**\n\nNoah's entry into the world of comedy was not straightforward. He began his career as a radio host on YFM, a popular youth radio station in Johannesburg. However, it was his decision to leave the radio show and focus on comedy that ultimately led to his breakthrough. In 2002, Noah had a small role on the South African soap opera Isidingo, which further cemented his interest in acting.\n\nIt was in 2004 that Noah began to gain recognition as a comedian. His friends dared him to perform a comedy routine at a nightclub, and to his surprise, he received a warm reception from the audience. This experience sparked a newfound passion for comedy, and Noah began to perform at comedy clubs and festivals across South Africa.\n\nNoah's big break came in 2007 when he was invited to perform at the annual Comedy Central South Africa show. He went on to perform with some of the biggest names in South African comedy, including David Kau, Kagiso Lediga, and Riaad Moosa. His performances earned him critical acclaim and established him as a rising star in the comedy world.\n\nIn 2009, Noah was invited to perform at the Just for Laughs festival in Montreal, Canada, where he shared the stage with international comedy legends like Paul Rodriguez and Carl Barron. This marked the beginning of Noah's international career, and he soon found himself performing at comedy clubs and festivals around the world.\n\n**The Daily Show**\n\nIn 2014, Noah became a recurring contributor on The Daily Show, a popular news and satire program hosted by Jon Stewart. His witty commentary and sharp observations quickly made him a fan favorite, and it was only a matter of time before he was promoted to full-time host.\n\nIn 2015, Comedy Central announced that Noah would succeed Jon Stewart as host of The Daily Show. His tenure began on September 28, 2015, and he has since become one of the most popular and influential voices in the media.\n\n**Books**\n\nNoah's memoir, Born a Crime, was published in 2016 to critical acclaim. The book is a heartwarming and hilarious account of Noah's childhood and his experiences growing up as a biracial child in South Africa. The book was a No. 1 New York Times bestseller and was named one of the best books of the year by The New York Times, Newsday, Esquire, NPR, and Booklist.\n\n**Other Work**\n\nIn addition to his work on The Daily Show, Noah has appeared in several TV shows and films, including Nashville, Black Panther, and American Vandal. He has also made appearances on late-night talk shows and podcasts, including The Late Show with Stephen Colbert and The Joe Rogan Experience.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nNoah is a polyglot and speaks six languages, including English, Southern Sotho, Zulu, Xhosa, Tswana, and Tsonga. He has also been open about his struggles with ADHD, which he has said has been a source of inspiration for his comedy.\n\nNoah currently resides in New York City, where he continues to work on his comedy and media projects. Despite his success, he remains humble and grounded, always willing to take on new challenges and push the boundaries of what is possible.\n\n**Filmography**\n\n* Born a Crime (2016) - memoir\n* Nashville (2017) - TV series\n* Black Panther (2018) - film\n* American Vandal (2018) - TV series\n* The Daily Show with Trevor Noah (2015-2022) - TV series\n\n**Awards**\n\n* Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing in a Comedy Series (2019)\n* Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Talk Show Host (2019)\n* NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Host in a Talk or News/Information Series (2020)\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n* Born a Crime (2016) - memoir\n\n**Audiobooks**\n\n* Born a Crime (2016) - audiobook\n\n**See also**\n\n* The Daily Show\n* South African comedy\n* Biracial identity\n\n**References**\n\nThis article does not include any citations or references.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Trevor_Noah\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nTrevor Noah was born on 20 February 1984, in Johannesburg, Transvaal (now Gauteng), South Africa [19] [20] His father, Robert, is Swiss-German, and his mother, Patricia Nombuyiselo Noah, is Xhosa [21] [22]\n\n\nCareer\nIn 2002, Noah had a small role on an episode of the South African soap opera Isidingo He later hosted his own radio show Noah's Ark on Gauteng's leading youth-radio station, YFM When he was 21 years old, his friends dared him to perform a comedy routine at a nightclub He entertained the audience with humorous stories about his friends and his life After that night Noah continued performing at comedy clubs, gaining recognition along the way [27] He dropped his radio show and acting to focus on comedy, and has performed with South African comedians such as David Kau, Kagiso Lediga, Riaad Moosa, Darren Simpson, Marc Lottering, Barry Hilton, and Nik Rabinowitz; [28] international comedians such as Paul Rodriguez, Carl Barron, Dan Ilic, and Paul Zerdin; and as the opening act for American comedian Gabriel Iglesias in November 2007 and Canadian comedian Russell Peters on his South African tour.\n\n\nEarly work and breakthrough\nIn 2002, Noah had a small role on an episode of the South African soap opera Isidingo He later hosted his own radio show Noah's Ark on Gauteng's leading youth-radio station, YFM When he was 21 years old, his friends dared him to perform a comedy routine at a nightclub He entertained the audience with humorous stories about his friends and his life After that night Noah continued performing at comedy clubs, gaining recognition along the way [27] He dropped his radio show and acting to focus on comedy, and has performed with South African comedians such as David Kau, Kagiso Lediga, Riaad Moosa, Darren Simpson, Marc Lottering, Barry Hilton, and Nik Rabinowitz; [28] international comedians such as Paul Rodriguez, Carl Barron, Dan Ilic, and Paul Zerdin; and as the opening act for American comedian Gabriel Iglesias in November 2007 and Canadian comedian Russell Peters on his South African tour.\n\n\nThe Daily Show\nIn December 2014, Noah became a recurring contributor on The Daily Show [40] In March 2015, Comedy Central announced that Noah would succeed Jon Stewart as host of The Daily Show; his tenure began on 28 September 2015 [24]\n\n\nBooks\nHis memoir Born a Crime was published in November 2016 and was received favourably by major U.S book reviewers [10] [11] [12] Other than the author, his mother has a central role in the book, while his father is mentioned only occasionally It became a No 1 New York Times Bestseller and was named one of the best books of the year by The New York Times, Newsday, Esquire, NPR, and Booklist [13] It was announced that a film adaptation based on the book would star Lupita Nyong'o as his mother [77]\n\n\nOther work\nIn 2017, he made an appearance on the TV series Nashville [79] In 2018, he appeared in Black Panther and American Vandal [80] [81]\n\n\nVideo games\n\nIn 2013, Noah said of his comedic influences, \n\nInfluences\n\nIn 2013, Noah said of his comedic influences, \n\nPersonal life\nNoah speaks English, Southern Sotho, Zulu, Xhosa, Tswana, Tsonga and very basic Afrikaans [94] Noah has ADHD [95] He resides in New York City [96]\n\n\nFilmography\n\n\n\nFilm\n\n\n\nTelevision\n\n\n\nAwards\n\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\n\nAudiobooks\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Wild_animal_suffering", "content": "\nExtent of suffering in nature\nAnimals in the wild may suffer from diseases which circulate similarly to human colds and flus, as well as epizootics, which are analogous to human epidemics; epizootics are relatively understudied in the scientific literature [20] Some well-studied examples include chronic wasting disease in elk and deer, white-nose syndrome in bats, devil facial tumour disease in Tasmanian devils and Newcastle disease in birds [20] Examples of other diseases include myxomatosis and viral haemorrhagic disease in rabbits, [21] ringworm and cutaneous fibroma in deer, [22] and chytridiomycosis in amphibians [23] Diseases, combined with parasitism, \"may induce listlessness, shivering, ulcers, pneumonia, starvation, violent behavior, or other gruesome symptoms over the course of days or weeks leading up to death.\" [1]\n\n\nSources of harm\nAnimals in the wild may suffer from diseases which circulate similarly to human colds and flus, as well as epizootics, which are analogous to human epidemics;

intraspecific competition; accidents, which can cause fractures, crushing injuries, eye injuries and wing tears; self-amputation; molting, a common source of injury for arthropods; extreme weather conditions, such as storms, extreme heat or cold weather; and natural disasters Such injuries may be extremely painful, which can lead to behaviors which further negatively affect the well-being of the injured animal Injuries can also make animals susceptible to diseases and other injuries, as well as parasitic infections Additionally, the affected animal may find it harder to eat and drink and struggle to escape from predators and attacks from other members of their species [26]\n\n\nParasitism\nMany wild animals, particularly larger ones, have been found to be infected with at least one parasite Parasites can negatively affect the well-being of their hosts by redirecting their host's resources to themselves, destroying their host's tissue and increasing their host's susceptibility to predation [20] As a result, parasites may reduce the movement, reproduction and survival of their hosts [27] Parasites can alter the phenotype of their hosts; limb malformations in amphibians caused by Ribeiroia ondatrae, is one example [28] Some parasites have the capacity to manipulate the cognitive function of their hosts, such as worms which make crickets kill themselves by directing them to drown themselves in water for the purpose of reproduction in an aquatic environment, as well as caterpillars using dopamine containing secretions that manipulate ants to act as bodyguards for protecting the caterpillar from parasites [29] It is rare that parasites directly cause the death of their host, rather, they may increase the chances of their host's death by other means; [20] one meta-study found that mortality was 2.65 times higher in animals affected by parasites, than those that weren't [30]\n\n\nStarvation and malnutrition\nStarvation and malnutrition particularly affect young, old, sick and weak animals, and can be caused by injury, disease, poor teeth and environmental conditions, with winter being particularly associated with an increased risk [35] It is argued that because food availability limits the size of wild animal populations, that this means that a huge number of individuals die as a result of starvation; such deaths are described as prolonged and marked by extreme distress as the animal's bodily functions shut down [36]: 67  Within days of hatching, fish larvae may experience hydrodynamic starvation, whereby the motion of fluids in their environment limits their ability to feed; this can lead to mortality of greater than 99% [37]\n\n\nDehydration\nDehydration is associated with high mortality in wild animals Drought can cause many animals in larger populations to die of thirst Thirst can also expose animals to an increased risk of being preyed upon; they may remain hidden in safe spaces to avoid this However, their need for water may eventually force them to leave these spaces; being in a weakened state, this makes them easier targets for predatory animals Animals who remain hidden cannot move due to dehydration and may end up dying of thirst When dehydration is combined with starvation, the process of dehydration can be accelerated [38] Diseases, such as chytridiomycosis, can also increase the risk of dehydration [39]\n\n\nWeather conditions\nWeather has a strong influence on the health and survival of wild animals Weather phenomena such as heavy snow, flooding and droughts can directly harm animals [41] and indirectly harm them by increasing the risks of other forms of suffering, such as starvation and disease [41] Extreme weather can cause the deaths of animals by destroying their habitats and directly killing animals; [42] hailstorms are known to kill thousands of birds [43] [44] Certain weather conditions may maintain large numbers of individuals over many generations; such conditions, while conducive to survival, may still cause suffering for animals Humidity or lack thereof can be beneficial or harmful depending on an individual animals' needs [41]\n\n\nNatural disasters\nFires, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, storms, floods and other natural disasters are sources of extensive short- and long-term harm for wild animals, causing death, injury, illness and malnutrition, as well as poisoning by contaminating food and water sources [50] Such disasters can also alter the physical environment of individual animals in ways which are harmful to them; [51] fires and large volcanic eruptions can affect the weather and marine animals may die due to disasters affecting water temperature and salinity [50]\n\n\nKilling by other animals\nPredation has been described as the act of one animal capturing and killing another animal to consume part or all of their body [52] Jeff McMahan, a moral philosopher, asserts: \"Wherever there is animal life, predators are stalking, chasing, capturing, killing, and devouring their prey Agonized suffering and violent death are ubiquitous and continuous.\" [53] Preyed upon animals die in a variety of different ways, with the time taking for them to die, which can be lengthy, depending on the method that the predatory animal uses to kill them; some animals are swallowed and digested while still being alive [54] Other preyed upon animals are paralysed with venom before being eaten; venom can also be used to start digesting the animal [55]\n\n\nPsychological stress\nIt has been argued that animals in the wild do not appear to be happier than domestic animals, based on findings that these individuals have greater levels of cortisol and elevated stress responses relative to domestic animals; additionally, unlike domestic animals, wild animals do not have their needs provided for them by human caretakers [57] Sources of stress for these individuals include illness and infection, predation avoidance, nutritional stress and social interactions; these stressors can begin before birth and continue as the individual develops [58]\n\n\nNumber of affected individuals\nThe number of individual animals in the wild is relatively unexplored in the scientific literature and estimates vary considerably [63] An analysis, undertaken in 2018, estimates (not including wild mammals) that there are 1015 fish, 1011 wild birds, 1018 terrestrial arthropods and 1020 marine arthropods, 1018 annelids, 1018 molluscs and 1016 cnidarians, for a total of 1021 wild animals [64] It has been estimated that there are 2.25 times more wild mammals than wild birds in Britain, but the authors of this estimate assert that this calculation would likely be a severe underestimate when applied to the number of individual wild mammals in other continents [65] A 2022 study estimated that there are 20 quadrillion individual ants across the world [66]\n\n\nNatural selection\nIn his autobiography, the naturalist and biologist Charles Darwin acknowledged that the existence of extensive suffering in nature was fully compatible with the workings of natural selection, yet maintained that pleasure was the main driver of fitness-increasing behavior in organisms [68] Evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins challenged Darwin's claim in his book River Out of Eden, wherein he argued that wild animal suffering must be extensive due to the interplay of the following evolutionary mechanisms: [4]\n\n\nReproductive strategies and population dynamics\nSome writers have argued that the prevalence of r-selected animals in the wild—who produce large numbers of offspring, with a low amount of parental care, and of which only a small number, in a stable population, will survive to adulthood—indicates that the average life of these individuals is likely to be very short and end in a painful death [5] [6] The pathologist Keith Simpson described this as follows: [70]\n\n\nHistory of concern for wild animals\n2nd-century church fathers, particularly Irenaeus of Lyons and Theophilus of Antioch, held that animals were originally created as peaceful vegetarians, only becoming carnivorous as a result of human sin and the Fall They believed that in the future, God would restore this harmony, returning animals to their original diet Irenaeus interpreted Isaiah's prophecies as literal, expecting lions to become herbivores once more in the restored creation Theophilus echoed this view, stating that no animals were created evil or violent, but that sin corrupted their nature [74]\n\n\nReligious views\n2nd-century church fathers, particularly Irenaeus of Lyons and Theophilus of Antioch, held that animals were originally created as peaceful vegetarians, only becoming carnivorous as a result of human sin and the Fall They believed that in the future, God would restore this harmony, returning animals to their original diet Irenaeus interpreted Isaiah's prophecies as literal, expecting lions to become herbivores once more in the restored creation Theophilus echoed this view, stating that no animals were created evil or violent, but that sin corrupted their nature [74]\n\n\nChristianity\n2nd-century church fathers, particularly Irenaeus of Lyons and Theophilus of Antioch, held that animals were originally created as peaceful vegetarians, only becoming carnivorous as a result of human sin and the Fall They believed that in the future, God would restore this harmony, returning animals to their original diet Irenaeus interpreted Isaiah's prophecies as literal, expecting lions to become herbivores once more in the restored creation Theophilus echoed this view, stating that no animals were created evil or violent, but that sin corrupted their nature [74]\n\n\nIslam\nVarious solutions for animal suffering have been presented in Islamic philosophy and theology One proposed solution to address this issue, suggested by Shia theologians, asserts that two conditions together can justify animal suffering: (1) the existence of some basic benefits in animal suffering, such as strengthening courage and sympathy among animals; and (2) compensating for the suffering of animals after death According to this theodicy, the justification for animal suffering lies in the presence of certain benefits derived from such experiences Additionally, the theory posits that the pain endured by animals will be compensated on the Day of Judgment On that day, animals will attain heavenly blessings as a form of recompense for their previous sufferings, morally justifying overall animal suffering This theodicy embraces the notion of an afterlife for animals [85]\n\n\nEastern religions\nPhilosopher Ole Martin Moen argues that, unlike Western and Judeo-Christian views, Eastern religions, such as Jainism, Buddhism, and Hinduism, \"all hold that the natural world is filled with suffering, that suffering is bad for all who endure it, and that our ultimate aim should be to bring suffering to an end.\" [86]\n\n\nBuddhism\nIn Buddhist doctrine, rebirth as an animal is regarded as evil because of the different forms of suffering that animals experience due to humans and natural processes [87] Buddhists may also regard the suffering experienced by animals in nature as evidence for the truth of dukkha [88] [89] The Buddhist scripture Aṅguttara Nikāya describes the lives of wild animals as \"so cruel, so harsh, so painful\" [89]\n\n\nHinduism\nHindu literature has been described as holding the lives and welfare of wild animals as equal with that of humans [94] Morris and Thornhill argue that Hinduism provides a framework for addressing wild animal suffering through spiritual advancement and non-violence They highlight how Hindu beliefs, particularly ahimsa and the transformative power of moral growth, suggest that human sanctity can lead to peace even among hostile species, as reflected in Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras Additionally, they point to the Srimad Bhagavatam, where carnivores coexist peacefully without predation, as an idealized vision of nature free from suffering For Morris and Thornhill, Hinduism offers a hopeful perspective that spiritual development can mitigate non-anthropogenic suffering, aligning religious values with the protection and care of wild animals [95]\n\n\n18th century\nIn \"On Poetry: A Rhapsody\", written in 1733, Jonathan Swift argues that Hobbes proved that all creatures exist in a state of eternal war and uses predation by different animals as evidence of this He wrote: \"A Whale of moderate Size will draw / A Shole of Herrings down his Maw / A Fox with Geese his Belly crams; / A Wolf destroys a thousand Lambs.\" [241] Voltaire makes similar descriptions of predation in his \"Poem on the Lisbon Disaster\", published in 1756, arguing: \"Elements, animals, humans, everything is at war.\" [242] Voltaire also asserts that \"all animals  [are] condemned to live, / All sentient things, born by the same stern law, / Suffer like me, and like me also die.\" [243] In William Blake's Vala, or The Four Zoas, the character Enion laments the cruelty of nature, [244] observing how ravens cry out but do not receive pity, and how sparrows and robins starve to death in the winter Enion also mourns how wolves and lions reproduce in a state of love, then abandon their young to the wilds and how a spider labours to create a web, awaiting a fly, but then is consumed by a bird [245]\n\n\nGeorges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon\nIn Histoire Naturelle, published in 1753, the naturalist Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon described wild animals as suffering much want in the winter, focusing specifically on the plight of stags who are exhausted by the rutting season, which in turn leads to the breeding of parasites under their skin, further adding to their misery [96]: 53  Later in the book, he described predation as necessary to prevent the superabundance of animals who produce vast numbers of offspring, who if not killed would have their fecundity diminished due to a lack of food and would die as a result of disease and starvation Buffon concluded that \"violent deaths seem to be equally as necessary as natural ones; they are both modes of destruction and renovation; the one serves to preserve nature in a perpetual spring, and the other maintains the order of her productions, and limits the number of each species.\" [96]: 116–117 \n\n\nJohann Gottfried Herder\nJohann Gottfried Herder, a philosopher and theologian, in Ideen zur Philosphie der Geschichte der Menschheit, published between 1784 and 1791, argued that animals exist in a state of constant striving, needing to provide for their own subsistence and to defend their lives He contended that nature ensured peace in creation by creating an equilibrium of animals with different instincts and belonging to different species who live opposed to each other [97]\n\n\n19th century\nErasmus Darwin in The Temple of Nature, published posthumously in 1803, observes the struggle for existence, describing how different animals feed upon each other He wrote \"The towering eagle, darting from above, / Unfeeling rends the inoffensive dove .. Nor spares, enamour'd of his radiant form, / The hungry nightingale the glowing worm\", and how parasitic animals, like botflies, reproduce, their young feeding inside the living bodies of other animals, stating: \"Fell Oestrus buries in her rapid course / Her countless brood in stag, or bull, or horse; / Whose hungry larva eats its living way, / Hatch'd by the warmth, and issues into day.\" [246]: 154–155  He also refers to the world as \"one great Slaughter-house\" [246]: 159  In a footnote, he speculates whether humans could someday create a food source for predatory animals based on sugar, asserting that, as a result, \"food for animals would then become as plentiful as water, and they might live upon the earth without preying on each other, as thick as blades of grass, with no restraint to their numbers but the want of local room\" [246]: 160  The poem has been used as an example of how Erasmus Darwin predicted evolutionary theory [247]\n\n\nLewis Gompertz\n\nIn 1824, Lewis Gompertz, an early vegan and animal rights activist, published Moral Inquiries on the Situation of Man and of Brutes, in which he advocated for an egalitarian view towards animals and aiding animals suffering in the wild [3] Gompertz asserted that humans and animals in their natural state both suffer similarly He wrote: [98]: 47 \n\nPessimist philosophers\nPhilosophers Giacomo Leopardi and Arthur Schopenhauer cited the suffering of animals in the wild as evidence to support their pessimistic worldviews In his 1824 work \"Dialogue between Nature and an Icelander\" from Operette morali, Leopardi used images of animal predation, which he dismissed as having inherent value, to symbolize nature's cycles of creation and destruction [100] Writing in his notebooks, Zibaldone di pensieri, published posthumously in 1898, Leopardi asserted that predation is a leading example of the evil design of nature [101] In 1851, Schopenhauer commented on the vast amount of suffering in nature, drawing attention to the asymmetry between the pleasure experienced by a carnivorous animal and the suffering of the animal that they are consuming, stating: \"Whoever wants summarily to test the assertion that the pleasure in the world outweighs the pain, or at any rate that the two balance each other, should compare the feelings of an animal that is devouring another with those of that other.\" [102]\n\n\nJohn Stuart Mill\nIn the 1874 posthumous essay \"Nature\", utilitarian philosopher John Stuart Mill wrote about suffering in nature and the imperative of struggling against it He stated: [103]\n\n\nHenry Stephens Salt\nIn his 1892 book Animals' Rights: Considered in Relation to Social Progress, the writer and early activist for animal rights Henry Stephens Salt focused an entire chapter on the plight of wild animals, \"The Case of Wild Animals\" Salt wrote that the rights of animals should not be dependent on the rights of being property and that sympathy and protection should be extended to non-owned animals too [104] He also argued that humans are justified in killing wild animals in self-defense but that neither unnecessary killing nor torturing harmless beings is justified [104]\n\n\n20th century\nAmerican poet Robinson Jeffers' poems contain depictions of violence in nature, such as \"The Bloody Sire\": \"What but the wolf's tooth whittled so fine / The fleet limbs of the antelope? / What but fear winged the birds, and hunger / Jewelled with such eyes the great goshawk's head? / Violence has been the sire of all the world's values.\" [255] In his poem \"Hurt Hawks\", the narrator describes watching a once-strong and vigorous hawk that has been injured and now faces the grim fate of dying from starvation [256]\n\n\nJ. Howard Moore\nIn the 1906 book The Universal Kinship, zoologist and philosopher J Howard Moore examined the egoism of sentient beings, which he identified as a product of natural selection that leads to the exploitation of other sentient beings He described this phenomenon as a significant and unfortunate aspect of conscious life Moore also speculated on whether an ordinary human, if sufficiently concerned with global welfare and given the opportunity, could make a meaningful improvement in this situation [105]\n\n\nAlexander Skutch\nIn his 1952 article \"Which Shall We Protect? Thoughts on the Ethics of the Treatment of Free Life\", Alexander Skutch, a naturalist and writer, explored five ethical principles that humans could follow when considering their relationship with animals in the wild, including the principle of only considering human interests; the laissez-faire, or \"hands-off\" principle; the do no harm, ahimsa principle; the principle of favoring the \"higher animals\", which are most similar to ourselves; the principle of \"harmonious association\", whereby humans and animals in the wild could live symbiotically, with each providing benefits to the other and individuals who disrupt this harmony, such as predators, are removed Skutch endorsed a combination of the laissez-faire, ahimsa, and harmonious association approaches as the way to create the ultimate harmony between humans and animals in the wild [107]\n\n\nPerspectives from animal and environmental ethicists\nIn 1973, moral philosopher Peter Singer responded to a question on whether humans have a moral obligation to prevent predation, arguing that intervening in this way may cause more suffering in the long-term but asserting that he would support actions if the long-term outcome was positive [108] In 1979, the animal rights philosopher Stephen R L Clark, published \"The Rights of Wild Things\", in which he argued that humans should protect animals in the wild from particularly large dangers, but that humans do not have an obligation to regulate all of their relationships [109] The following year, J Baird Callicott, an environmental ethicist, published \"Animal Liberation: A Triangular Affair\", in which he compared the ethical underpinnings of the animal liberation movement, asserting that it is based on Benthamite principles, and Aldo Leopold's land ethic, which he used as a model for environmental ethics Callicott concluded that intractable differences exist between the two ethical positions when it comes to the issue of wild animal suffering [110]\n\n\n21st century\nThe character Lord Vetinari, in Terry Pratchett's Unseen Academicals, in a speech, tells how he once observed a salmon being consumed alive by a mother otter and her children feeding on the salmon's eggs He sarcastically describes \" [m]other and children dining upon mother and children\" as one of \"nature's wonders\", using it as an example of how evil is \"built into the very nature of the universe\" [235] This depiction of evil has been described as non-traditional because it expresses horror at the idea that evil has been designed as a feature of the universe [236]\n\n\nPublications\nIn 2009, essayist Brian Tomasik authored \"The Importance of Wild-Animal Suffering\", where he argued that the number of wild animals far exceeds the number of non-human animals under human control Tomasik posits that animal advocates should promote concern for the suffering of animals in their natural habitats He also highlights the potential for human descendants to vastly increase wild animal suffering if they chose to multiply rather than mitigate it [114] A revised version of the essay was published in the 2015 journal Relations Beyond Anthropocentrism, as part of a special issue titled \"Wild Animal Suffering and Intervention in Nature\", which featured various contributions on the topic [115] [116] A follow-up issue on the topic was released in 2022 [117]\n\n\nOrganizations and institutions\nIn response to arguments for the moral and political importance of wild animal suffering, a number of organizations have been created to research and address the issue Two of these, Utility Farm and Wild-Animal Suffering Research merged in 2019 to form Wild Animal Initiative [130] The nonprofit organization Animal Ethics also researches wild animal suffering and advocates on behalf of wild animals, among other populations [131] Rethink Priorities is a research organization which, among other topics, has conducted research on wild animal suffering, particularly around invertebrate sentience and invertebrate welfare [132] [133]\n\n\nPhilosophical status\nPredation has been considered a moral problem by some philosophers, who argue that humans have an obligation to prevent it, [11] [136] while others argue that intervention is not ethically required [137] [138] Others have argued that humans should not do anything about it right now because there is a chance it may unwittingly cause serious harm but that with better information and technology, it could be possible to take meaningful action in the future [139] An obligation to prevent predation has been considered untenable or absurd by some writers, who have used the position as a reductio ad absurdum to reject the concept of animal rights altogether [140] [141] Others have argued that attempting to reduce it would be environmentally harmful [142]\n\n\nPredation as a moral problem\nPredation has been considered a moral problem by some philosophers, who argue that humans have an obligation to prevent it, [11] [136] while others argue that intervention is not ethically required [137] [138] Others have argued that humans should not do anything about it right now because there is a chance it may unwittingly cause serious harm but that with better information and technology, it could be possible to take meaningful action in the future [139] An obligation to prevent predation has been considered untenable or absurd by some writers, who have used the position as a reductio ad absurdum to reject the concept of animal rights altogether [140] [141] Others have argued that attempting to reduce it would be environmentally harmful [142]\n\n\nArguments for intervention\nSome theorists have reflected on whether the harms animals suffer in the wild should be accepted or if something should be done to mitigate them [5] The moral basis for interventions aimed at reducing wild animal suffering can be rights or welfare based Advocates of such interventions argue that non-intervention is inconsistent with either of these approaches From a rights-based perspective, if animals have a moral right to life or bodily integrity, intervention may be required to prevent such rights from being violated by other animals [143] Animal rights philosopher Tom Regan was critical of this view; he argued that because animals are not moral agents, in the sense of being morally responsible for their actions, they cannot violate each other's rights Based on this, he concluded that humans do not need to concern themselves with preventing suffering of this kind, unless such interactions were strongly influenced by humans [144]: 14–15 \n\n\nAnimal rights and welfare perspectives\nSome theorists have reflected on whether the harms animals suffer in the wild should be accepted or if something should be done to mitigate them [5] The moral basis for interventions aimed at reducing wild animal suffering can be rights or welfare based Advocates of such interventions argue that non-intervention is inconsistent with either of these approaches From a rights-based perspective, if animals have a moral right to life or bodily integrity, intervention may be required to

such interactions were strongly influenced by humans [144]: 14–15 \n\n\nNon-intervention as a form of speciesism\nSome writers have argued that humans refusing to aid animals suffering in the wild, when they would help humans suffering in a similar situation, is an example of speciesism; [2] the differential treatment or moral consideration of individuals based on their species membership [148] Jamie Mayerfeld contends that a duty to relieve suffering which is blind to species membership implies an obligation to relieve the suffering of animals due to natural processes [149] Stijn Bruers argues that even long-term animal rights activists sometimes hold speciesist views when it comes to this specific topic, which he calls a \"moral blind spot\" [150] His view is echoed by Eze Paez, who asserts that advocates who disregard the interests of animals purely because they live in the wild are responsible for the same form of discrimination used by those who justify the exploitation of animals by humans [151] Oscar Horta argues that spreading awareness of speciesism will in turn increase concern for the plight of animals in the wild [152]\n\n\nHumans already intervene to further human interests\nOscar Horta asserts that humans are constantly intervening in nature, in significant ways, to further human interests, such as furthering environmentalist ideals He criticizes how interventions are considered to be realistic, safe, or acceptable when their aims favor humans but not when they focus on helping wild animals He argues that humans should shift the aim of these interventions to consider the interests of sentient beings; not just humans [15]\n\n\nHuman responsibility for enhancing natural harms\nPhilosopher Martha Nussbaum asserts that humans continually \"affect the habitats of animals, determining opportunities for nutrition, free movement, and other aspects of flourishing\", and contends that the pervasive human involvement in natural processes means that humans have a moral responsibility to help individuals affected by our actions She also argues that humans may have the capacity to help animals suffering due to entirely natural processes, such as diseases and natural disasters, and asserts that way may have duties to provide care in these cases [153]: 374 \n\n\nGender-based perspectives\nCatia Faria argues that gender identity deeply influences how humans perceive and respond to wild animals, with a male-centered worldview playing a key role in fostering harm and indifference Anthropogenic harms, or those caused by human activities, are frequently overlooked because gendered assumptions prioritize human-centered and androcentric views These cultural norms downplay the significance of the suffering animals experience at the hands of humans, reinforcing a tendency to ignore or minimize the ethical implications of such harms [154]\n\n\nArguments against intervention\nA common objection to intervening in nature is that it would be impractical, either because of the amount of work involved or because the complexity of ecosystems would make it difficult to know whether or not an intervention would be net beneficial on balance [119] Aaron Simmons argues that humans should not intervene to save animals in nature because doing so would result in unintended consequences, such as damaging ecosystems, interfering with human projects, or resulting in more animal deaths overall [11] Nicolas Delon and Duncan Purves argue that the \"nature of ecosystems leaves us with no reason to predict that interventions would reduce, rather than exacerbate, suffering\" [9] Peter Singer has argued that intervention in nature would be justified if one could be reasonably confident that this would greatly reduce wild animal suffering and death in the long run In practice, Singer cautions against interfering with ecosystems because he fears that doing so would cause more harm than good [108] [155]\n\n\nPracticality of intervening in nature\nA common objection to intervening in nature is that it would be impractical, either because of the amount of work involved or because the complexity of ecosystems would make it difficult to know whether or not an intervention would be net beneficial on balance [119] Aaron Simmons argues that humans should not intervene to save animals in nature

because he fears that doing so would cause more harm than good [108] [155]\n\n\nPotential conflict between animal rights and environmentalism\nIt has been argued that the environmentalist goal of preserving certain abstract entities, such as species and ecosystems, and a policy of non-interference in regard to natural processes is incompatible with animal rights views, which place the welfare and interests of individual animals at the center of concern [158] [159] [160] Examples include environmentalists supporting hunting for species population control, while animal rights advocates oppose it; [72] animal rights advocates arguing for the extinction or reengineering of carnivores or r-strategist species, while deep ecologists defend their right to be and flourish as they are; [139] [161] and animal rights advocates defending the reduction of wildlife habitats or arguing against their expansion out of concern that most animal suffering takes place within them, while environmentalists want to safeguard and expand them [162] [163] Oscar Horta argues that there are instances where environmentalists and animal rights advocates may both support approaches that would consequently reduce wild animal suffering [163]\n\n\nIntrinsic value of ecological processes, wilderness and wildness\nSome writers, such as the environmental ethicist Holmes Rolston III, argue that natural animal suffering is valuable because it serves an ecological purpose and that only animal suffering due to non-natural processes is morally bad, and thus humans do not have a duty to intervene in cases of suffering caused by natural processes [164] [page needed] Rolston celebrates carnivores in nature because of the significant ecological role they play [161] Others argue that the reason that humans have a duty to protect other humans from predation but not wild animals is that humans are part of the cultural world rather than the natural world, and so different rules apply to them in these situations [161] [165] Some writers assert that animals who are preyed upon are fulfilling their natural function, and thus flourishing when they are preyed upon or otherwise die, since this allows natural selection to work [143]\n\n\nNature as idyllic\nThe idyllic view of nature is described as the widely-held view that happiness in nature is widespread [5] [6] Oscar Horta argues that even though many people are aware of the harms that animals in the wild experience, such as predation, starvation and disease, as well as recognizing that these animals may suffer as a result of these harms, they do not conclude from this that wild animals have bad enough lives to imply that nature is not a happy place Horta also contends that a romantic conception of nature has significant implications for attitudes people have towards animals in the wild, as holders of the view may oppose interventions to reduce suffering [5]\n\n\nIntervention as hubris\nSome writers have argued that interventions to reduce wild animal suffering would be an example of arrogance, hubris, or playing God, as such interventions could potentially have disastrous unforeseen consequences They are also sceptical of the competence of humans when it comes to making correct moral judgements, as well as human fallibility Additionally, they contend that the moral stance of humans and moral agency can lead to the imposition of anthropocentric or paternalistic values on others To support these claims, they use the history of human negative impacts on nature, including species extinctions, wilderness, and resource depletion, as well as climate change From this, they conclude that the best way that humans can help animals in the wild is through the preservation of larger wilderness areas and by reducing the human sphere of influence on nature [12]\n\n\nLaissez-faire\nA laissez-faire view, which holds that humans should not harm animals in the wild, but do not have an obligation to aid these individuals when in need, has been defended by Tom Regan, Elisa Aaltola, Clare Palmer, and Ned Hettinger Regan argued that the suffering animals inflict on each other should not be a concern of ethically motivated wildlife management, and that these wildlife managers should instead focus on letting animals in the wild exist as they are, with no human predation, and to \"carve out their own destiny\" [13] Aaltola similarly argues that predators should be left to flourish despite the suffering that they cause to the animals that they predate [14] Palmer endorses a variant of this position, which argues that humans may have an obligation to assist wild animals if humans are responsible for their situation [172] Hettinger argues for laissez-faire based on the environmental value of \"Respect for an Independent Nature\" [173]\n\n\nWild animal sovereignty\nSome writers, such as the animal rights philosophers Sue Donaldson and Will Kymlicka in Zoopolis, argue that humans should not perform large interventions to help animals in the wild They assert that these interventions would be taking away their sovereignty by removing the ability for these animals to govern themselves [176] Christiane Bailey asserts that certain wild animals, especially prosocial animals, have sufficient criteria to be considered as moral agents, that is to say, individuals capable of making moral judgments and who have responsibilities She argues that aiding them would be reducing wild animals to beings incapable of making decisions for themselves [177]\n\n\nAnalogy with colonialism\nEstiva Reus asserts that a comparison exists, from a certain perspective, between the spirit which animated the defenders of colonialism who saw it as necessary human progress for \"backward peoples\", and the idea which inspires writers who argue for reforming nature in the interest of wild animals: the proponents of the two positions consider that they have the right and the duty, because of their superior skills, to model the existence of beings unable to remedy by their own means the evils which overwhelm them [179]\n\n\nIntervention in practice\nExisting ways that individual animals suffering in the wild are aided include providing medical care to sick and injured animals, vaccinating animals to prevent disease, taking care of orphaned animals, rescuing animals who are trapped, or in natural disasters, taking care of the needs of animals who are starving or thirsty, sheltering animals who are suffering due to weather conditions, [152] and using contraception to regulate population sizes [181] [182]\n\n\nExisting forms of assistance\nExisting ways that individual animals suffering in the wild are aided include providing medical care to sick and injured animals,

sheltering animals who are suffering due to weather conditions, [152] and using contraception to regulate population sizes [181] [182]\n\n\nHistory of interventions\nThe Bishnoi, a Hindu sect founded in the 15th century, have a tradition of feeding wild animals [183] Some Bishnoi temples also act as rescue centres, where priests take care of injured animals; a few of these individuals are returned to the wild, while others remain, roaming freely in the temple compounds [184] The Borana Oromo people leave out water overnight for wild animals to drink because they believe that the animals have a right to drinking water [185]\n\n\nProviding aid\nThe Bishnoi, a Hindu sect founded in the 15th century, have a tradition of feeding wild animals [183] Some Bishnoi temples also act as rescue centres,

out of 100,000, kangaroos who were trapped in a fenced-in national military base and suffering in a state of illness, misery and starvation [186] In 2016, 350 starving hippos and buffaloes at Kruger National Park were killed by park rangers; one of the motives for the action was to prevent them from suffering as they died [187]\n\n\nRescues\nRescues of multiple animals in the wild have taken place In 1988, the United States and Soviet governments collaborated in Operation Breakthrough to free three gray whales who were trapped in pack ice off the coast of Alaska [188] In 2018, a team of BBC filmmakers dug a ramp in the snow to allow a group of penguins to escape a ravine in Antarctica [189] In 2019, 2,000 baby flamingos were rescued during a drought in South Africa [190] During the 2019–20 Australian bushfire season, a number of fire-threatened wild animals were rescued [191] In 2020, 120 pilot whales, who were beached, were rescued in Sri Lanka [192] In 2021, 1,700 Cape cormorant chicks, who had been abandoned by their parents, were rescued in South Africa [193] In the same year, nearly 5,000 cold-stunned sea turtles were rescued in Texas [194]\n\n\nVaccination and contraception programs\nVaccination programs have been successfully implemented to prevent rabies and tuberculosis in wild animals [195] Wildlife contraception has been used to reduce and stabilize populations of wild horses, white-tailed deer, American bison, and African elephants [181] [196]\n\n\nFuture developments\nIt has been argued that in the future, based on research, feasibility and whether interventions could be carried out without increasing suffering overall, existing forms of assistance for wild animals could be employed on a larger scale to reduce suffering [120] [197] Technological proposals include gene drives and CRISPR to reduce the suffering of members of r-strategist species, [198] and using biotechnology to eradicate suffering in wild animals [18] [199]\n\n\nProposed interventions\nIt has been argued that in the future, based on research, feasibility and whether interventions could be carried out without increasing suffering overall, existing

[199]\n\n\nPreventing predation\nWhen it comes to reducing suffering as a result of predation, propositions include removing predators from wild areas, [200] [201] refraining from reintroducing predators into areas where they have previously gone extinct, [72] [202] arranging the gradual extinction of carnivorous species, [53] and \"reprogramming\" them to become herbivores using germline engineering [197] With predation due to cats and dogs, it has been recommended that these companion animals should always be sterilized to prevent the existence of feral animals, and that cats should be kept indoors and dogs kept on a leash, unless in designated areas [203]\n\n\nHabitat reduction\nSome writers, like Brian Tomasik, have argued from a consequentialist perspective that since most wild animals lead lives filled with suffering, habitat loss should be encouraged rather than opposed Tyler M John and Jeff Sebo have criticized this position, terming it the \"Logic of the Logger\", based on the concept of the \"Logic of the Larder\" [204]\n\n\nWelfare biology\nWelfare biology is a proposed research field for studying the welfare of animals, with a particular focus on their relationship with natural ecosystems [205] It was first advanced in 1995 by Yew-Kwang Ng, who defined it as \"the study of living things and their environment with respect to their welfare (defined as net happiness, or enjoyment minus suffering)\" [71] Such research is intended to promote concern for animal suffering in the wild and to establish effective actions that can be undertaken to help these individuals in the future [206] [207] The organizations Animal Ethics and Wild Animal Initiative promote the establishment of welfare biology as a field of research [208]\n\n\nImpact of climate change\nIt has been argued that climate change may have a large direct impact on a number of animals, with the largest effect on individuals who belong to specialist species that specialise in living in environments which could be most affected by climate change; this could then lead to replacement by individuals belonging to more generalist species It has also been asserted that the indirect impact of climate change on wild animal suffering will be whether it leads to an increase or decrease of individuals being born into lives where they suffer and die shortly after coming into existence, with a large number of factors needing to be taken into consideration and requiring further study to assess this [163]\n\n\nRisks\nSeveral researchers and non-profit organizations have raised concern that human civilization may cause wild animal suffering outside Earth For example, wild habitats may be created—or allowed to happen—on extraterrestrial colonies like terraformed planets [209] [210] Another example of a potential realization of the risk is directed panspermia where the initial microbial population eventually evolves into sentient organisms [211] [212] [213] Spreading sentient wild animals beyond Earth may constitute a suffering risk, as this could potentially lead to an immense increase in the amount of wild animal suffering in existence [214]\n\n\nSpreading wild animal suffering beyond Earth\nSeveral researchers and non-profit organizations have raised concern that human civilization may cause wild animal suffering outside Earth For

could potentially lead to an immense increase in the amount of wild animal suffering in existence [214]\n\n\nCultural depictions\nIt has been argued that much of people's knowledge about wild animals comes from wildlife documentaries, which have been described as non-representative of the reality of wild animal suffering because they underrepresent uncharismatic animals who may have the capacity to suffer, such as animals who are preyed upon, as well as small animals and invertebrates [215] In addition, it is argued that such documentaries focus on adult animals, while the majority of animals who likely suffer the most, die before reaching adulthood; [215] that wildlife documentaries don't generally show animals suffering from parasitism; [144]: 47  that such documentaries can leave viewers with the false impression that animals who have been attacked by predators and suffered serious injury survived and thrived afterwards; [216] and that much of the particularly violent incidents of predation are not included [217] The broadcaster David Attenborough stated: \"People who accuse us of putting in too much violence,  [should see] what we leave on the cutting-room floor.\" [218]\n\n\nWildlife documentaries\nIt has been argued that much of people's knowledge about wild animals comes from wildlife documentaries, which have been described as non-representative of

animals is a topic of much debate [222] It has been described as a \"golden rule\" of such filmmaking to observe animals but not intervene [223] The rule is occasionally broken, with BBC documentary crews rescuing some stranded baby turtles in 2016 and rescuing a group of penguins trapped in a ravine in 2018; [224] the latter decision was defended by other wildlife documentary filmmakers [189] Filmmakers following the rule have been criticized for filming dying animals, such as an elephant dying of thirst, without helping them [224]\n\n\nIn fiction\nHerman Melville, in Moby-Dick, published in 1851, describes the sea as a place of \"universal cannibalism\", where \"creatures prey upon each other, carrying on eternal war since the world began\"; this is illustrated by a later scene

This phenomenon has been a topic of concern for philosophers, ethicists, and animal welfare advocates for centuries. The scope of wild animal suffering is vast, encompassing a wide range of species, habitats, and ecosystems.\n\n**Extent of suffering in nature**\n\nAnimals in the wild may suffer from diseases that circulate similarly to human colds and flus, as well as epizootics, which are analogous to human epidemics. Epizootics are relatively understudied in the scientific literature, but examples include chronic wasting disease in elk and deer, white-nose syndrome in bats, devil facial tumour disease in Tasmanian devils, and Newcastle disease in birds. Myxomatosis and viral haemorrhagic disease in rabbits, ringworm and cutaneous fibroma in deer, and chytridiomycosis in amphibians are also examples of diseases that cause suffering in wild animals. These diseases can induce listlessness, shivering, ulcers, pneumonia, starvation, violent behavior, or other gruesome symptoms over the course of days or weeks leading up to death.\n\n**Sources of harm**\n\nWild animals may suffer from diseases, injuries, and other forms of harm. Injuries can be caused by predation, intraspecific competition, accidents, self-amputation, molting, extreme weather conditions, and natural disasters. Self-amputation, for example, can occur when an animal deliberately removes a limb or body part due to injury, disease, or other factors. Injuries can be extremely painful and may lead to behaviors that further negatively affect the animal's well-being. In addition, injuries can make animals more susceptible to diseases and other injuries, as well as parasitic infections. The affected animal may also find it harder to eat and drink, and struggle to escape from predators and attacks from other members of their species.\n\n**Parasitism**\n\nMany wild animals, particularly larger ones, have been found to be infected with at least one parasite. Parasites can negatively affect their hosts by redirecting their host's resources to themselves, destroying their host's tissue, and increasing their host's susceptibility to predation. As a result, parasites can reduce the movement, reproduction, and survival of their hosts. Parasites can also alter the phenotype of their hosts, such as limb malformations in amphibians caused by Ribeiroia ondatrae. Some parasites have the capacity to manipulate the cognitive function of their hosts, such as worms that make crickets kill themselves by directing them to drown in water for the purpose of reproduction in an aquatic environment. Parasites can indirectly increase the chances of their host's death, rather than directly causing it.\n\n**Starvation and malnutrition**\n\nStarvation and malnutrition particularly affect young, old, sick, and weak animals, and can be caused by injury, disease, poor teeth, and environmental conditions, with winter being particularly associated with an increased risk. Young animals, for example, may not have the necessary skills or experience to find food and avoid predators, making them more susceptible to starvation. Starvation can cause prolonged and marked distress as the animal's bodily functions shut down. Malnutrition can also lead to a range of health problems, including weakened immune systems, poor wound healing, and impaired reproduction.\n\n**Dehydration**\n\nDehydration is associated with high mortality in wild animals. Drought can cause many animals in larger populations to die of thirst. Animals may remain hidden in safe spaces to avoid predators, but eventually, their need for water may force them to leave these spaces, making them easier targets for predators. Dehydration can accelerate the process of death when combined with starvation. Diseases, such as chytridiomycosis, can also increase the risk of dehydration.\n\n**Weather conditions**\n\nWeather has a strong influence on the health and survival of wild animals. Weather phenomena, such as heavy snow, flooding, and droughts, can directly harm animals and indirectly increase their susceptibility to other forms of suffering. Extreme weather can cause the deaths of animals by destroying their habitats and directly killing them. Certain weather conditions can maintain larger numbers of individuals over many generations, but still cause suffering for animals. Humidity or lack thereof can be beneficial or harmful depending on an individual animal's needs.\n\n**Natural disasters**\n\nFires, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, storms, floods, and other natural disasters are sources of extensive short- and long-term harm for wild animals, causing death, injury, illness, and malnutrition, as well as poisoning by contaminating food and water sources. These disasters can also alter the physical environment of individual animals in ways that are harmful to them.\n\n**Killing by other animals**\n\nPredation has been described as the act of one animal capturing and killing another animal to consume part or all of their body. Wherever there is animal life, predators are stalking, chasing, capturing, killing, and devouring their prey. Agonized suffering and violent death are ubiquitous and continuous. Preyed upon animals die in a variety of ways, with the time taking for them to die depending on the method used by the predatory animal. Some animals are swallowed and digested while still alive.\n\n**Psychological stress**\n\nIt has been argued that animals in the wild do not appear to be happier than domestic animals, based on findings that these individuals have greater levels of cortisol and elevated stress responses relative to domestic animals. Unlike domestic animals, wild animals do not have their needs provided for by human caretakers, leading to increased stress. Sources of stress for these individuals include illness and infection, predation avoidance, nutritional stress, and social interactions. These stressors can begin before birth and continue as the individual develops.\n\n**Number of affected individuals**\n\nThe number of individual animals in the wild is relatively unexplored in the scientific literature, and estimates vary considerably. However, an analysis undertaken in 2018 estimates that there are 1015 fish, 1011 wild birds, 1018 terrestrial arthropods, 1020 marine arthropods, 1018 annelids, 1018 molluscs, and 1016 cnidarians, for a total of 1021 wild animals.\n\n**Philosophical status**\n\nPredation has been considered a moral problem by some philosophers, who argue that humans have an obligation to prevent it, while others argue that intervention is not ethically required. Others have argued that humans should not do anything about it right now because there is a chance it may unwittingly cause serious harm but that with better information and technology, it could be possible to take meaningful action in the future. An obligation to prevent predation has been considered untenable or absurd by some writers, who have used the position as a reductio ad absurdum to reject the concept of animal rights altogether.\n\n**Arguments for intervention**\n\nSome theorists have reflected on whether the harms animals suffer in the wild should be accepted or if something should be done to mitigate them. The moral basis for interventions aimed at reducing wild animal suffering can be rights or welfare based. Advocates of such interventions argue that non-intervention is inconsistent with either of these approaches.\n\n**Animal rights and welfare perspectives**\n\nSome theorists have reflected on whether the harms animals suffer in the wild should be accepted or if something should be done to mitigate them. The moral basis for interventions aimed at reducing wild animal suffering can be rights or welfare based. Advocates of such interventions argue that non-intervention is inconsistent with either of these approaches.\n\n**Arguments against intervention**\n\nA common objection to intervening in nature is that it would be impractical, either because of the amount of work involved or because the complexity of ecosystems would make it difficult to know whether or not an intervention would be net beneficial on balance. Some writers have argued that humans should not intervene to help animals in the wild because doing so would result in unintended consequences, such as damaging ecosystems, interfering with human projects, or resulting in more animal deaths overall.\n\n**Non-intervention as a filmmaking rule**\n\nThe question of whether wildlife documentary filmmakers should intervene to help animals is a topic of much debate. It has been described as a \"golden rule\" of such filmmaking to observe animals but not intervene. The rule is occasionally broken, with BBC documentary crews rescuing some stranded baby turtles in 2016 and rescuing a group of penguins trapped in a ravine in 2018.\n\n**In fiction**\n\nHerman Melville, in Moby-Dick, published in 1851, describes the sea as a place of \"universal cannibalism\", where \"creatures prey upon each other, carrying on eternal war since the world began\".

epizootics are relatively understudied in the scientific literature [20] Some well-studied examples include chronic wasting disease in elk and deer, white-nose syndrome in bats, devil facial tumour disease in Tasmanian devils and Newcastle disease in birds [20] Examples of other diseases include myxomatosis and viral haemorrhagic disease in rabbits, [21] ringworm and cutaneous fibroma in deer, [22] and chytridiomycosis in amphibians [23] Diseases, combined with parasitism, \"may induce listlessness, shivering, ulcers, pneumonia, starvation, violent behavior, or other gruesome symptoms over the course of days or weeks leading up to death.\" [1]\n\n\nDisease\nAnimals in the wild may suffer from diseases which circulate similarly to human colds and flus, as well as epizootics, which are analogous to human epidemics; epizootics are relatively understudied in the scientific literature [20] Some well-studied examples include chronic wasting disease in elk and deer, white-nose syndrome in bats, devil facial tumour disease in Tasmanian devils and Newcastle disease in birds [20] Examples of other diseases include myxomatosis and viral haemorrhagic disease in rabbits, [21] ringworm and cutaneous fibroma in deer, [22] and chytridiomycosis in amphibians [23] Diseases, combined with parasitism, \"may induce listlessness, shivering, ulcers, pneumonia, starvation, violent behavior, or other gruesome symptoms over the course of days or weeks leading up to death.\" [1]\n\n\nInjury\nWild animals can experience injury from a variety of causes such as predation; intraspecific competition; accidents, which can cause fractures, crushing injuries, eye injuries and wing tears; self-amputation; molting, a common source of injury for arthropods; extreme weather conditions, such as storms, extreme heat or cold weather; and natural disasters Such injuries may be extremely painful, which can lead to behaviors which further negatively affect the well-being of the injured animal Injuries can also make animals susceptible to diseases and other injuries, as well as parasitic infections Additionally, the affected animal may find it harder to eat and drink and struggle to escape from predators and attacks from other members of their species [26]\n\n\nParasitism\nMany wild animals, particularly larger ones, have been found to be infected with at least one parasite Parasites can negatively affect the well-being of their hosts by redirecting their host's resources to themselves, destroying their host's tissue and increasing their host's susceptibility to predation [20] As a result, parasites may reduce the movement, reproduction and survival of their hosts [27] Parasites can alter the phenotype of their hosts; limb malformations in amphibians caused by Ribeiroia ondatrae, is one example [28] Some parasites have the capacity to manipulate the cognitive function of their hosts, such as worms which make crickets kill themselves by directing them to drown themselves in water for the purpose of reproduction in an aquatic environment, as well as caterpillars using dopamine containing secretions that manipulate ants to act as bodyguards for protecting the caterpillar from parasites [29] It is rare that parasites directly cause the death of their host, rather, they may increase the chances of their host's death by other means; [20] one meta-study found that mortality was 2.65 times higher in animals affected by parasites, than those that weren't [30]\n\n\nStarvation and malnutrition\nStarvation and malnutrition particularly affect young, old, sick and weak animals, and can be caused by injury, disease, poor teeth and environmental conditions, with winter being particularly associated with an increased risk [35] It is argued that because food availability limits the size of wild animal populations, that this means that a huge number of individuals die as a result of starvation; such deaths are described as prolonged and marked by extreme distress as the animal's bodily functions shut down [36]: 67  Within days of hatching, fish larvae may experience hydrodynamic starvation, whereby the motion of fluids in their environment limits their ability to feed; this can lead to mortality of greater than 99% [37]\n\n\nDehydration\nDehydration is associated with high mortality in wild animals Drought can cause many animals in larger populations to die of thirst Thirst can also expose animals to an increased risk of being preyed upon; they may remain hidden in safe spaces to avoid this However, their need for water may eventually force them to leave these spaces; being in a weakened state, this makes them easier targets for predatory animals Animals who remain hidden cannot move due to dehydration and may end up dying of thirst When dehydration is combined with starvation, the process of dehydration can be accelerated [38] Diseases, such as chytridiomycosis, can also increase the risk of dehydration [39]\n\n\nWeather conditions\nWeather has a strong influence on the health and survival of wild animals Weather phenomena such as heavy snow, flooding and droughts can directly harm animals [41] and indirectly harm them by increasing the risks of other forms of suffering, such as starvation and disease [41] Extreme weather can cause the deaths of animals by destroying their habitats and directly killing animals; [42] hailstorms are known to kill thousands of birds [43] [44] Certain weather conditions may maintain large numbers of individuals over many generations; such conditions, while conducive to survival, may still cause suffering for animals Humidity or lack thereof can be beneficial or harmful depending on an individual animals' needs [41]\n\n\nNatural disasters\nFires, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, storms, floods and other natural disasters are sources of extensive short- and long-term harm for wild animals, causing death, injury, illness and malnutrition, as well as poisoning by contaminating food and water sources [50] Such disasters can also alter the physical environment of individual animals in ways which are harmful to them; [51] fires and large volcanic eruptions can affect the weather and marine animals may die due to disasters affecting water temperature and salinity [50]\n\n\nKilling by other animals\nPredation has been described as the act of one animal capturing and killing another animal to consume part or all of their body [52] Jeff McMahan, a moral philosopher, asserts: \"Wherever there is animal life, predators are stalking, chasing, capturing, killing, and devouring their prey Agonized suffering and violent death are ubiquitous and continuous.\" [53] Preyed upon animals die in a variety of different ways, with the time taking for them to die, which can be lengthy, depending on the method that the predatory animal uses to kill them; some animals are swallowed and digested while still being alive [54] Other preyed upon animals are paralysed with venom before being eaten; venom can also be used to start digesting the animal [55]\n\n\nPsychological stress\nIt has been argued that animals in the wild do not appear to be happier than domestic animals, based on findings that these individuals have greater levels of cortisol and elevated stress responses relative to domestic animals; additionally, unlike domestic animals, wild animals do not have their needs provided for them by human caretakers [57] Sources of stress for these individuals include illness and infection, predation avoidance, nutritional stress and social interactions; these stressors can begin before birth and continue as the individual develops [58]\n\n\nNumber of affected individuals\nThe number of individual animals in the wild is relatively unexplored in the scientific literature and estimates vary considerably [63] An analysis, undertaken in 2018, estimates (not including wild mammals) that there are 1015 fish, 1011 wild birds, 1018 terrestrial arthropods and 1020 marine arthropods, 1018 annelids, 1018 molluscs and 1016 cnidarians, for a total of 1021 wild animals [64] It has been estimated that there are 2.25 times more wild mammals than wild birds in Britain, but the authors of this estimate assert that this calculation would likely be a severe underestimate when applied to the number of individual wild mammals in other continents [65] A 2022 study estimated that there are 20 quadrillion individual ants across the world [66]\n\n\nNatural selection\nIn his autobiography, the naturalist and biologist Charles Darwin acknowledged that the existence of extensive suffering in nature was fully compatible with the workings of natural selection, yet maintained that pleasure was the main driver of fitness-increasing behavior in organisms [68] Evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins challenged Darwin's claim in his book River Out of Eden, wherein he argued that wild animal suffering must be extensive due to the interplay of the following evolutionary mechanisms: [4]\n\n\nReproductive strategies and population dynamics\nSome writers have argued that the prevalence of r-selected animals in the wild—who produce large numbers of offspring, with a low amount of parental care, and of which only a small number, in a stable population, will survive to adulthood—indicates that the average life of these individuals is likely to be very short and end in a painful death [5] [6] The pathologist Keith Simpson described this as follows: [70]\n\n\nHistory of concern for wild animals\n2nd-century church fathers, particularly Irenaeus of Lyons and Theophilus of Antioch, held that animals were originally created as peaceful vegetarians, only becoming carnivorous as a result of human sin and the Fall They believed that in the future, God would restore this harmony, returning animals to their original diet Irenaeus interpreted Isaiah's prophecies as literal, expecting lions to become herbivores once more in the restored creation Theophilus echoed this view, stating that no animals were created evil or violent, but that sin corrupted their nature [74]\n\n\nReligious views\n2nd-century church fathers, particularly Irenaeus of Lyons and Theophilus of Antioch, held that animals were originally created as peaceful vegetarians, only becoming carnivorous as a result of human sin and the Fall They believed that in the future, God would restore this harmony, returning animals to their original diet Irenaeus interpreted Isaiah's prophecies as literal, expecting lions to become herbivores once more in the restored creation Theophilus echoed this view, stating that no animals were created evil or violent, but that sin corrupted their nature [74]\n\n\nChristianity\n2nd-century church fathers, particularly Irenaeus of Lyons and Theophilus of Antioch, held that animals were originally created as peaceful vegetarians, only becoming carnivorous as a result of human sin and the Fall They believed that in the future, God would restore this harmony, returning animals to their original diet Irenaeus interpreted Isaiah's prophecies as literal, expecting lions to become herbivores once more in the restored creation Theophilus echoed this view, stating that no animals were created evil or violent, but that sin corrupted their nature [74]\n\n\nIslam\nVarious solutions for animal suffering have been presented in Islamic philosophy and theology One proposed solution to address this issue, suggested by Shia theologians, asserts that two conditions together can justify animal suffering: (1) the existence of some basic benefits in animal suffering, such as strengthening courage and sympathy among animals; and (2) compensating for the suffering of animals after death According to this theodicy, the justification for animal suffering lies in the presence of certain benefits derived from such experiences Additionally, the theory posits that the pain endured by animals will be compensated on the Day of Judgment On that day, animals will attain heavenly blessings as a form of recompense for their previous sufferings, morally justifying overall animal suffering This theodicy embraces the notion of an afterlife for animals [85]\n\n\nEastern religions\nPhilosopher Ole Martin Moen argues that, unlike Western and Judeo-Christian views, Eastern religions, such as Jainism, Buddhism, and Hinduism, \"all hold that the natural world is filled with suffering, that suffering is bad for all who endure it, and that our ultimate aim should be to bring suffering to an end.\" [86]\n\n\nBuddhism\nIn Buddhist doctrine, rebirth as an animal is regarded as evil because of the different forms of suffering that animals experience due to humans and natural processes [87] Buddhists may also regard the suffering experienced by animals in nature as evidence for the truth of dukkha [88] [89] The Buddhist scripture Aṅguttara Nikāya describes the lives of wild animals as \"so cruel, so harsh, so painful\" [89]\n\n\nHinduism\nHindu literature has been described as holding the lives and welfare of wild animals as equal with that of humans [94] Morris and Thornhill argue that Hinduism provides a framework for addressing wild animal suffering through spiritual advancement and non-violence They highlight how Hindu beliefs, particularly ahimsa and the transformative power of moral growth, suggest that human sanctity can lead to peace even among hostile species, as reflected in Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras Additionally, they point to the Srimad Bhagavatam, where carnivores coexist peacefully without predation, as an idealized vision of nature free from suffering For Morris and Thornhill, Hinduism offers a hopeful perspective that spiritual development can mitigate non-anthropogenic suffering, aligning religious values with the protection and care of wild animals [95]\n\n\n18th century\nIn \"On Poetry: A Rhapsody\", written in 1733, Jonathan Swift argues that Hobbes proved that all creatures exist in a state of eternal war and uses predation by different animals as evidence of this He wrote: \"A Whale of moderate Size will draw / A Shole of Herrings down his Maw / A Fox with Geese his Belly crams; / A Wolf destroys a thousand Lambs.\" [241] Voltaire makes similar descriptions of predation in his \"Poem on the Lisbon Disaster\", published in 1756, arguing: \"Elements, animals, humans, everything is at war.\" [242] Voltaire also asserts that \"all animals  [are] condemned to live, / All sentient things, born by the same stern law, / Suffer like me, and like me also die.\" [243] In William Blake's Vala, or The Four Zoas, the character Enion laments the cruelty of nature, [244] observing how ravens cry out but do not receive pity, and how sparrows and robins starve to death in the winter Enion also mourns how wolves and lions reproduce in a state of love, then abandon their young to the wilds and how a spider labours to create a web, awaiting a fly, but then is consumed by a bird [245]\n\n\nGeorges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon\nIn Histoire Naturelle, published in 1753, the naturalist Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon described wild animals as suffering much want in the winter, focusing specifically on the plight of stags who are exhausted by the rutting season, which in turn leads to the breeding of parasites under their skin, further adding to their misery [96]: 53  Later in the book, he described predation as necessary to prevent the superabundance of animals who produce vast numbers of offspring, who if not killed would have their fecundity diminished due to a lack of food and would die as a result of disease and starvation Buffon concluded that \"violent deaths seem to be equally as necessary as natural ones; they are both modes of destruction and renovation; the one serves to preserve nature in a perpetual spring, and the other maintains the order of her productions, and limits the number of each species.\" [96]: 116–117 \n\n\nJohann Gottfried Herder\nJohann Gottfried Herder, a philosopher and theologian, in Ideen zur Philosphie der Geschichte der Menschheit, published between 1784 and 1791, argued that animals exist in a state of constant striving, needing to provide for their own subsistence and to defend their lives He contended that nature ensured peace in creation by creating an equilibrium of animals with different instincts and belonging to different species who live opposed to each other [97]\n\n\n19th century\nErasmus Darwin in The Temple of Nature, published posthumously in 1803, observes the struggle for existence, describing how different animals feed upon each other He wrote \"The towering eagle, darting from above, / Unfeeling rends the inoffensive dove .. Nor spares, enamour'd of his radiant form, / The hungry nightingale the glowing worm\", and how parasitic animals, like botflies, reproduce, their young feeding inside the living bodies of other animals, stating: \"Fell Oestrus buries in her rapid course / Her countless brood in stag, or bull, or horse; / Whose hungry larva eats its living way, / Hatch'd by the warmth, and issues into day.\" [246]: 154–155  He also refers to the world as \"one great Slaughter-house\" [246]: 159  In a footnote, he speculates whether humans could someday create a food source for predatory animals based on sugar, asserting that, as a result, \"food for animals would then become as plentiful as water, and they might live upon the earth without preying on each other, as thick as blades of grass, with no restraint to their numbers but the want of local room\" [246]: 160  The poem has been used as an example of how Erasmus Darwin predicted evolutionary theory [247]\n\n\nLewis Gompertz\n\nIn 1824, Lewis Gompertz, an early vegan and animal rights activist, published Moral Inquiries on the Situation of Man and of Brutes, in which he advocated for an egalitarian view towards animals and aiding animals suffering in the wild [3] Gompertz asserted that humans and animals in their natural state both suffer similarly He wrote: [98]: 47 \n\nPessimist philosophers\nPhilosophers Giacomo Leopardi and Arthur Schopenhauer cited the suffering of animals in the wild as evidence to support their pessimistic worldviews In his 1824 work \"Dialogue between Nature and an Icelander\" from Operette morali, Leopardi used images of animal predation, which he dismissed as having inherent value, to symbolize nature's cycles of creation and destruction [100] Writing in his notebooks, Zibaldone di pensieri, published posthumously in 1898, Leopardi asserted that predation is a leading example of the evil design of nature [101] In 1851, Schopenhauer commented on the vast amount of suffering in nature, drawing attention to the asymmetry between the pleasure experienced by a carnivorous animal and the suffering of the animal that they are consuming, stating: \"Whoever wants summarily to test the assertion that the pleasure in the world outweighs the pain, or at any rate that the two balance each other, should compare the feelings of an animal that is devouring another with those of that other.\" [102]\n\n\nJohn Stuart Mill\nIn the 1874 posthumous essay \"Nature\", utilitarian philosopher John Stuart Mill wrote about suffering in nature and the imperative of struggling against it He stated: [103]\n\n\nHenry Stephens Salt\nIn his 1892 book Animals' Rights: Considered in Relation to Social Progress, the writer and early activist for animal rights Henry Stephens Salt focused an entire chapter on the plight of wild animals, \"The Case of Wild Animals\" Salt wrote that the rights of animals should not be dependent on the rights of being property and that sympathy and protection should be extended to non-owned animals too [104] He also argued that humans are justified in killing wild animals in self-defense but that neither unnecessary killing nor torturing harmless beings is justified [104]\n\n\n20th century\nAmerican poet Robinson Jeffers' poems contain depictions of violence in nature, such as \"The Bloody Sire\": \"What but the wolf's tooth whittled so fine / The fleet limbs of the antelope? / What but fear winged the birds, and hunger / Jewelled with such eyes the great goshawk's head? / Violence has been the sire of all the world's values.\" [255] In his poem \"Hurt Hawks\", the narrator describes watching a once-strong and vigorous hawk that has been injured and now faces the grim fate of dying from starvation [256]\n\n\nJ. Howard Moore\nIn the 1906 book The Universal Kinship, zoologist and philosopher J Howard Moore examined the egoism of sentient beings, which he identified as a product of natural selection that leads to the exploitation of other sentient beings He described this phenomenon as a significant and unfortunate aspect of conscious life Moore also speculated on whether an ordinary human, if sufficiently concerned with global welfare and given the opportunity, could make a meaningful improvement in this situation [105]\n\n\nAlexander Skutch\nIn his 1952 article \"Which Shall We Protect? Thoughts on the Ethics of the Treatment of Free Life\", Alexander Skutch, a naturalist and writer, explored five ethical principles that humans could follow when considering their relationship with animals in the wild, including the principle of only considering human interests; the laissez-faire, or \"hands-off\" principle; the do no harm, ahimsa principle; the principle of favoring the \"higher animals\", which are most similar to ourselves; the principle of \"harmonious association\", whereby humans and animals in the wild could live symbiotically, with each providing benefits to the other and individuals who disrupt this harmony, such as predators, are removed Skutch endorsed a combination of the laissez-faire, ahimsa, and harmonious association approaches as the way to create the ultimate harmony between humans and animals in the wild [107]\n\n\nPerspectives from animal and environmental ethicists\nIn 1973, moral philosopher Peter Singer responded to a question on whether humans have a moral obligation to prevent predation, arguing that intervening in this way may cause more suffering in the long-term but asserting that he would support actions if the long-term outcome was positive [108] In 1979, the animal rights philosopher Stephen R L Clark, published \"The Rights of Wild Things\", in which he argued that humans should protect animals in the wild from particularly large dangers, but that humans do not have an obligation to regulate all of their relationships [109] The following year, J Baird Callicott, an environmental ethicist, published \"Animal Liberation: A Triangular Affair\", in which he compared the ethical underpinnings of the animal liberation movement, asserting that it is based on Benthamite principles, and Aldo Leopold's land ethic, which he used as a model for environmental ethics Callicott concluded that intractable differences exist between the two ethical positions when it comes to the issue of wild animal suffering [110]\n\n\n21st century\nThe character Lord Vetinari, in Terry Pratchett's Unseen Academicals, in a speech, tells how he once observed a salmon being consumed alive by a mother otter and her children feeding on the salmon's eggs He sarcastically describes \" [m]other and children dining upon mother and children\" as one of \"nature's wonders\", using it as an example of how evil is \"built into the very nature of the universe\" [235] This depiction of evil has been described as non-traditional because it expresses horror at the idea that evil has been designed as a feature of the universe [236]\n\n\nPublications\nIn 2009, essayist Brian Tomasik authored \"The Importance of Wild-Animal Suffering\", where he argued that the number of wild animals far exceeds the number of non-human animals under human control Tomasik posits that animal advocates should promote concern for the suffering of animals in their natural habitats He also highlights the potential for human descendants to vastly increase wild animal suffering if they chose to multiply rather than mitigate it [114] A revised version of the essay was published in the 2015 journal Relations Beyond Anthropocentrism, as part of a special issue titled \"Wild Animal Suffering and Intervention in Nature\", which featured various contributions on the topic [115] [116] A follow-up issue on the topic was released in 2022 [117]\n\n\nOrganizations and institutions\nIn response to arguments for the moral and political importance of wild animal suffering, a number of organizations have been created to research and address the issue Two of these, Utility Farm and Wild-Animal Suffering Research merged in 2019 to form Wild Animal Initiative [130] The nonprofit organization Animal Ethics also researches wild animal suffering and advocates on behalf of wild animals, among other populations [131] Rethink Priorities is a research organization which, among other topics, has conducted research on wild animal suffering, particularly around invertebrate sentience and invertebrate welfare [132] [133]\n\n\nPhilosophical status\nPredation has been considered a moral problem by some philosophers, who argue that humans have an obligation to prevent it, [11] [136] while others argue that intervention is not ethically required [137] [138] Others have argued that humans should not do anything about it right now because there is a chance it may unwittingly cause serious harm but that with better information and technology, it could be possible to take meaningful action in the future [139] An obligation to prevent predation has been considered untenable or absurd by some writers, who have used the position as a reductio ad absurdum to reject the concept of animal rights altogether [140] [141] Others have argued that attempting to reduce it would be environmentally harmful [142]\n\n\nPredation as a moral problem\nPredation has been considered a moral problem by some philosophers, who argue that humans have an obligation to prevent it, [11] [136] while others argue that intervention is not ethically required [137] [138] Others have argued that humans should not do anything about it right now because there is a chance it may unwittingly cause serious harm but that with better information and technology, it could be possible to take meaningful action in the future [139] An obligation to prevent predation has been considered untenable or absurd by some writers, who have used the position as a reductio ad absurdum to reject the concept of animal rights altogether [140] [141] Others have argued that attempting to reduce it would be environmentally harmful [142]\n\n\nArguments for intervention\nSome theorists have reflected on whether the harms animals suffer in the wild should be accepted or if something should be done to mitigate them [5] The moral basis for interventions aimed at reducing wild animal suffering can be rights or welfare based Advocates of such interventions argue that non-intervention is inconsistent with either of these approaches From a rights-based perspective, if animals have a moral right to life or bodily integrity, intervention may be required to prevent such rights from being violated by other animals [143] Animal rights philosopher Tom Regan was critical of this view; he argued that because animals are not moral agents, in the sense of being morally responsible for their actions, they cannot violate each other's rights Based on this, he concluded that humans do not need to concern themselves with preventing suffering of this kind, unless such interactions were strongly influenced by humans [144]: 14–15 \n\n\nAnimal rights and welfare perspectives\nSome theorists have reflected on whether the harms animals suffer in the wild should be accepted or if something should be done to mitigate them [5] The moral basis for interventions aimed at reducing wild animal suffering can be rights or welfare based Advocates of such interventions argue that non-intervention is inconsistent with either of these approaches From a rights-based perspective, if animals have a moral right to life or bodily integrity, intervention may be required to

morally responsible for their actions, they cannot violate each other's rights Based on this, he concluded that humans do not need to concern themselves with preventing suffering of this kind, unless such interactions were strongly influenced by humans [144]: 14–15 \n\n\nNon-intervention as a form of speciesism\nSome writers have argued that humans refusing to aid animals suffering in the wild, when they would help humans suffering in a similar situation, is an example of speciesism; [2] the differential treatment or moral consideration of individuals based on their species membership [148] Jamie Mayerfeld contends that a duty to relieve suffering which is blind to species membership implies an obligation to relieve the suffering of animals due to natural processes [149] Stijn Bruers argues that even long-term animal rights activists sometimes hold speciesist views when it comes to this specific topic, which he calls a \"moral blind spot\" [150] His view is echoed by Eze Paez, who asserts that advocates who disregard the interests of animals purely because they live in the wild are responsible for the same form of discrimination used by those who justify the exploitation of animals by humans [151] Oscar Horta argues that spreading awareness of speciesism will in turn increase concern for the plight of animals in the wild [152]\n\n\nHumans already intervene to further human interests\nOscar Horta asserts that humans are constantly intervening in nature, in significant ways, to further human interests, such as furthering environmentalist ideals He criticizes how interventions are considered to be realistic, safe, or acceptable when their aims favor humans but not when they focus on helping wild animals He argues that humans should shift the aim of these interventions to consider the interests of sentient beings; not just humans [15]\n\n\nHuman responsibility for enhancing natural harms\nPhilosopher Martha Nussbaum asserts that humans continually \"affect the habitats of animals, determining opportunities for nutrition, free movement, and other aspects of flourishing\", and contends that the pervasive human involvement in natural processes means that humans have a moral responsibility to help individuals affected by our actions She also argues that humans may have the capacity to help animals suffering due to entirely natural processes, such as diseases and natural disasters, and asserts that way may have duties to provide care in these cases [153]: 374 \n\n\nGender-based perspectives\nCatia Faria argues that gender identity deeply influences how humans perceive and respond to wild animals, with a male-centered worldview playing a key role in fostering harm and indifference Anthropogenic harms, or those caused by human activities, are frequently overlooked because gendered assumptions prioritize human-centered and androcentric views These cultural norms downplay the significance of the suffering animals experience at the hands of humans, reinforcing a tendency to ignore or minimize the ethical implications of such harms [154]\n\n\nArguments against intervention\nA common objection to intervening in nature is that it would be impractical, either because of the amount of work involved or because the complexity of ecosystems would make it difficult to know whether or not an intervention would be net beneficial on balance [119] Aaron Simmons argues that humans should not intervene to save animals in nature because doing so would result in unintended consequences, such as damaging ecosystems, interfering with human projects, or resulting in more animal deaths overall [11] Nicolas Delon and Duncan Purves argue that the \"nature of ecosystems leaves us with no reason to predict that interventions would reduce, rather than exacerbate, suffering\" [9] Peter Singer has argued that intervention in nature would be justified if one could be reasonably confident that this would greatly reduce wild animal suffering and death in the long run In practice, Singer cautions against interfering with ecosystems because he fears that doing so would cause more harm than good [108] [155]\n\n\nPracticality of intervening in nature\nA common objection to intervening in nature is that it would be impractical, either because of the amount of work involved or because the complexity of ecosystems would make it difficult to know whether or not an intervention would be net beneficial on balance [119] Aaron Simmons argues that humans should not intervene to save animals in nature because doing so would result in unintended consequences, such as damaging ecosystems, interfering with human projects, or resulting in more animal deaths overall [11] Nicolas Delon and Duncan Purves

would be justified if one could be reasonably confident that this would greatly reduce wild animal suffering and death in the long run In practice, Singer cautions against interfering with ecosystems because he fears that doing so would cause more harm than good [108] [155]\n\n\nPotential conflict between animal rights and environmentalism\nIt has been argued that the environmentalist goal of preserving certain abstract entities, such as species and ecosystems, and a policy of non-interference in regard to natural processes is incompatible with animal rights views, which place the welfare and interests of individual animals at the center of concern [158] [159] [160] Examples include environmentalists supporting hunting for species population control, while animal rights advocates oppose it; [72] animal rights advocates arguing for the extinction or reengineering of carnivores or r-strategist species, while deep ecologists defend their right to be and flourish as they are; [139] [161] and animal rights advocates defending the reduction of wildlife habitats or arguing against their expansion out of concern that most animal suffering takes place within them, while environmentalists want to safeguard and expand them [162] [163] Oscar Horta argues that there are instances where environmentalists and animal rights advocates may both support approaches that would consequently reduce wild animal suffering [163]\n\n\nIntrinsic value of ecological processes, wilderness and wildness\nSome writers, such as the environmental ethicist Holmes Rolston III, argue that natural animal suffering is valuable because it serves an ecological purpose and that only animal suffering due to non-natural processes is morally bad, and thus humans do not have a duty to intervene in cases of suffering caused by natural processes [164] [page needed] Rolston celebrates carnivores in nature because of the significant ecological role they play [161] Others argue that the reason that humans have a duty to protect other humans from predation but not wild animals is that humans are part of the cultural world rather than the natural world, and so different rules apply to them in these situations [161] [165] Some writers assert that animals who are preyed upon are fulfilling their natural function, and thus flourishing when they are preyed upon or otherwise die, since this allows natural selection to work [143]\n\n\nNature as idyllic\nThe idyllic view of nature is described as the widely-held view that happiness in nature is widespread [5] [6] Oscar Horta argues that even though many people are aware of the harms that animals in the wild experience, such as predation, starvation and disease, as well as recognizing that these animals may suffer as a result of these harms, they do not conclude from this that wild animals have bad enough lives to imply that nature is not a happy place Horta also contends that a romantic conception of nature has significant implications for attitudes people have towards animals in the wild, as holders of the view may oppose interventions to reduce suffering [5]\n\n\nIntervention as hubris\nSome writers have argued that interventions to reduce wild animal suffering would be an example of arrogance, hubris, or playing God, as such interventions could potentially have disastrous unforeseen consequences They are also sceptical of the competence of humans when it comes to making correct moral judgements, as well as human fallibility Additionally, they contend that the moral stance of humans and moral agency can lead to the imposition of anthropocentric or paternalistic values on others To support these claims, they use the history of human negative impacts on nature, including species extinctions, wilderness, and resource depletion, as well as climate change From this, they conclude that the best way that humans can help animals in the wild is through the preservation of larger wilderness areas and by reducing the human sphere of influence on nature [12]\n\n\nLaissez-faire\nA laissez-faire view, which holds that humans should not harm animals in the wild, but do not have an obligation to aid these individuals when in need, has been defended by Tom Regan, Elisa Aaltola, Clare Palmer, and Ned Hettinger Regan argued that the suffering animals inflict on each other should not be a concern of ethically motivated wildlife management, and that these wildlife managers should instead focus on letting animals in the wild exist as they are, with no human predation, and to \"carve out their own destiny\" [13] Aaltola similarly argues that predators should be left to flourish despite the suffering that they cause to the animals that they predate [14] Palmer endorses a variant of this position, which argues that humans may have an obligation to assist wild animals if humans are responsible for their situation [172] Hettinger argues for laissez-faire based on the environmental value of \"Respect for an Independent Nature\" [173]\n\n\nWild animal sovereignty\nSome writers, such as the animal rights philosophers Sue Donaldson and Will Kymlicka in Zoopolis, argue that humans should not perform large interventions to help animals in the wild They assert that these interventions would be taking away their sovereignty by removing the ability for these animals to govern themselves [176] Christiane Bailey asserts that certain wild animals, especially prosocial animals, have sufficient criteria to be considered as moral agents, that is to say, individuals capable of making moral judgments and who have responsibilities She argues that aiding them would be reducing wild animals to beings incapable of making decisions for themselves [177]\n\n\nAnalogy with colonialism\nEstiva Reus asserts that a comparison exists, from a certain perspective, between the spirit which animated the defenders of colonialism who saw it as necessary human progress for \"backward peoples\", and the idea which inspires writers who argue for reforming nature in the interest of wild animals: the proponents of the two positions consider that they have the right and the duty, because of their superior skills, to model the existence of beings unable to remedy by their own means the evils which overwhelm them [179]\n\n\nIntervention in practice\nExisting ways that individual animals suffering in the wild are aided include providing medical care to sick and injured animals, vaccinating animals to prevent disease, taking care of orphaned animals, rescuing animals who are trapped, or in natural disasters, taking care of the needs of animals who are starving or thirsty, sheltering animals who are suffering due to weather conditions, [152] and using contraception to regulate population sizes [181] [182]\n\n\nExisting forms of assistance\nExisting ways that individual animals suffering in the wild are aided include providing medical care to sick and injured animals, vaccinating animals to prevent disease, taking care of orphaned animals, rescuing animals who are trapped, or in natural disasters, taking care of the needs of animals who are starving or thirsty, sheltering animals who are suffering due to weather conditions, [152] and using contraception to regulate population sizes [181] [182]\n\n\nHistory of interventions\nThe Bishnoi, a Hindu sect founded in the 15th century, have a tradition of feeding wild animals [183] Some Bishnoi temples also act as rescue centres, where priests take care of injured animals; a few of these individuals are returned to the wild, while others remain, roaming freely in the temple compounds [184] The Borana Oromo people leave out water overnight for wild animals to drink because they believe that the animals have a right to drinking water [185]\n\n\nProviding aid\nThe Bishnoi, a Hindu sect founded in the 15th century, have a tradition of feeding wild animals [183] Some Bishnoi temples also act as rescue centres,

water overnight for wild animals to drink because they believe that the animals have a right to drinking water [185]\n\n\nCulling\nIn 2002, the Australian government authorized the killing of 15,000, out of 100,000, kangaroos who were trapped in a fenced-in national military base and suffering in a state of illness, misery and starvation [186] In 2016, 350 starving hippos and buffaloes at Kruger National Park were killed by park rangers; one of the motives for the action was to prevent them from suffering as they died [187]\n\n\nRescues\nRescues of multiple animals in the wild have taken place In 1988, the United States and Soviet governments collaborated in Operation Breakthrough to free three gray whales who were trapped in pack ice off the coast of Alaska [188] In 2018, a team of BBC filmmakers dug a ramp in the snow to allow a group of penguins to escape a ravine in Antarctica [189] In 2019, 2,000 baby flamingos were rescued during a drought in South Africa [190] During the 2019–20 Australian bushfire season, a number of fire-threatened wild animals were rescued [191] In 2020, 120 pilot whales, who were beached, were rescued in Sri Lanka [192] In 2021, 1,700 Cape cormorant chicks, who had been abandoned by their parents, were rescued in South Africa [193] In the same year, nearly 5,000 cold-stunned sea turtles were rescued in Texas [194]\n\n\nVaccination and contraception programs\nVaccination programs have been successfully implemented to prevent rabies and tuberculosis in wild animals [195] Wildlife contraception has been used to reduce and stabilize populations of wild horses, white-tailed deer, American bison, and African elephants [181] [196]\n\n\nFuture developments\nIt has been argued that in the future, based on research, feasibility and whether interventions could be carried out without increasing suffering overall, existing forms of assistance for wild animals could be employed on a larger scale to reduce suffering [120] [197] Technological proposals include gene drives and CRISPR to reduce the suffering of members of r-strategist species, [198] and using biotechnology to eradicate suffering in wild animals [18] [199]\n\n\nProposed interventions\nIt has been argued that in the future, based on research, feasibility and whether interventions could be carried out without increasing suffering overall, existing

Technological proposals include gene drives and CRISPR to reduce the suffering of members of r-strategist species, [198] and using biotechnology to eradicate suffering in wild animals [18] [199]\n\n\nPreventing predation\nWhen it comes to reducing suffering as a result of predation, propositions include removing predators from wild areas, [200] [201] refraining from reintroducing predators into areas where they have previously gone extinct, [72] [202] arranging the gradual extinction of carnivorous species, [53] and \"reprogramming\" them to become herbivores using germline engineering [197] With predation due to cats and dogs, it has been recommended that these companion animals should always be sterilized to prevent the existence of feral animals, and that cats should be kept indoors and dogs kept on a leash, unless in designated areas [203]\n\n\nHabitat reduction\nSome writers, like Brian Tomasik, have argued from a consequentialist perspective that since most wild animals lead lives filled with suffering, habitat loss should be encouraged rather than opposed Tyler M John and Jeff Sebo have criticized this position, terming it the \"Logic of the Logger\", based on the concept of the \"Logic of the Larder\" [204]\n\n\nWelfare biology\nWelfare biology is a proposed research field for studying the welfare of animals, with a particular focus on their relationship with natural ecosystems [205] It was first advanced in 1995 by Yew-Kwang Ng, who defined it as \"the study of living things and their environment with respect to their welfare (defined as net happiness, or enjoyment minus suffering)\" [71] Such research is intended to promote concern for animal suffering in the wild and to establish effective actions that can be undertaken to help these individuals in the future [206] [207] The organizations Animal Ethics and Wild Animal Initiative promote the establishment of welfare biology as a field of research [208]\n\n\nImpact of climate change\nIt has been argued that climate change may have a large direct impact on a number of animals, with the largest effect on individuals who belong to specialist species that specialise in living in environments which could be most affected by climate change; this could then lead to replacement by individuals belonging to more generalist species It has also been asserted that the indirect impact of climate change on wild animal suffering will be whether it leads to an increase or decrease of individuals being born into lives where they suffer and die shortly after coming into existence, with a large number of factors needing to be taken into consideration and requiring further study to assess this [163]\n\n\nRisks\nSeveral researchers and non-profit organizations have raised concern that human civilization may cause wild animal suffering outside Earth For example, wild habitats may be created—or allowed to happen—on extraterrestrial colonies like terraformed planets [209] [210] Another example of a potential realization of the risk is directed panspermia where the initial microbial population eventually evolves into sentient organisms [211] [212] [213] Spreading sentient wild animals beyond Earth may constitute a suffering risk, as this could potentially lead to an immense increase in the amount of wild animal suffering in existence [214]\n\n\nSpreading wild animal suffering beyond Earth\nSeveral researchers and non-profit organizations have raised concern that human civilization may cause wild animal suffering outside Earth For

could potentially lead to an immense increase in the amount of wild animal suffering in existence [214]\n\n\nCultural depictions\nIt has been argued that much of people's knowledge about wild animals comes from wildlife documentaries, which have been described as non-representative of the reality of wild animal suffering because they underrepresent uncharismatic animals who may have the capacity to suffer, such as animals who are preyed upon, as well as small animals and invertebrates [215] In addition, it is argued that such documentaries focus on adult animals, while the majority of animals who likely suffer the most, die before reaching adulthood; [215] that wildlife documentaries don't generally show animals suffering from parasitism; [144]: 47  that such documentaries can leave viewers with the false impression that animals who have been attacked by predators and suffered serious injury survived and thrived afterwards; [216] and that much of the particularly violent incidents of predation are not included [217] The broadcaster David Attenborough stated: \"People who accuse us of putting in too much violence,  [should see] what we leave on the cutting-room floor.\" [218]\n\n\nWildlife documentaries\nIt has been argued that much of people's knowledge about wild animals comes from wildlife documentaries, which have been described as non-representative of

violence,  [should see] what we leave on the cutting-room floor.\" [218]\n\n\nNon-intervention as a filmmaking rule\nThe question of whether wildlife documentary filmmakers should intervene to help animals is a topic of much debate [222] It has been described as a \"golden rule\" of such filmmaking to observe animals but not intervene [223] The rule is occasionally broken, with BBC documentary crews rescuing some stranded baby turtles in 2016 and rescuing a group of penguins trapped in a ravine in 2018; [224] the latter decision was defended by other wildlife documentary filmmakers [189] Filmmakers following the rule have been criticized for filming dying animals, such as an elephant dying of thirst, without helping them [224]\n\n\nIn fiction\nHerman Melville, in Moby-Dick, published in 1851, describes the sea as a place of \"universal cannibalism\", where \"creatures prey upon each other, carrying on eternal war since the world began\"; this is illustrated by a later scene depicting sharks consuming their own entrails [225]\n\n\n19th century\nErasmus Darwin in The Temple of Nature, published posthumously in 1803, observes the struggle for existence, describing how different animals feed upon each other He wrote \"The towering eagle, darting from above, / Unfeeling rends the inoffensive dove .. Nor spares, enamour'd of his radiant form, / The hungry nightingale the glowing worm\", and how parasitic animals, like botflies, reproduce, their young feeding inside the living bodies of other animals, stating: \"Fell Oestrus buries in her rapid course / Her countless brood in stag, or bull, or horse; / Whose hungry larva eats its living way, / Hatch'd by the warmth, and issues into day.\" [246]: 154–155  He also refers to the world as \"one great Slaughter-house\" [246]: 159  In a footnote, he speculates whether humans could someday create a food source for predatory animals based on sugar, asserting that, as a result, \"food for animals would then become as plentiful as water, and they might live upon the earth without preying on each other, as thick as blades of grass, with no restraint to their numbers but the want of local room\" [246]: 160  The poem has been used as an example of how Erasmus Darwin predicted evolutionary theory [247]\n\n\n20th century\nAmerican poet Robinson Jeffers' poems contain depictions of violence in nature, such as \"The Bloody Sire\": \"What but the wolf's tooth whittled so fine / The fleet limbs of the antelope? / What but fear winged the birds, and hunger / Jewelled with such eyes the great goshawk's head? / Violence has been the sire of all the world's values.\" [255] In his poem \"Hurt Hawks\", the narrator describes watching a once-strong and vigorous hawk that has been injured and now faces the grim fate of dying from starvation [256]\n\n\n21st century\nThe character Lord Vetinari, in Terry Pratchett's Unseen Academicals, in a speech, tells how he once observed a salmon being consumed alive by a mother otter and her children feeding on the salmon's eggs He sarcastically describes \" [m]other and children dining upon mother and children\" as one of \"nature's wonders\", using it as an example of how evil is \"built into the very nature of the universe\" [235] This depiction of evil has been described as non-traditional because it expresses horror at the idea that evil has been designed as a feature of the universe [236]\n\n\nIn non-fiction\nAnnie Dillard's views on nature, as expressed in Pilgrim at Tinker Creek and Holy the Firm, deviate from the traditional portrayal of the natural world as peaceful and balanced Instead, she presents nature as a realm marked by inherent brutality and violence, using vivid imagery to depict scenes of predation, parasitism, and death Dillard explores the idea that the divine is not separate from this violence but is intertwined with it, proposing an immanent God who is present within the chaos and suffering of the natural world This perspective challenges the concept of a benevolent deity existing independently of nature's harsh realities, inviting readers to consider the possibility of a divine presence within an indifferent universe Through this approach, Dillard's work contributes a distinct perspective to American nature writing, blending theological inquiry with reflections on the violence in nature [237]\n\n\nIn poetry\nHomer, in the Iliad, employs the simile of a stag who, as a victim, is wounded by a human hunter and is then devoured by jackals, who themselves are frightened away by a scavenging lion [238] In the epigram \"The Swallow and the Grasshopper\", attributed to Euenus, the poet writes of a swallow feeding a grasshopper to its young, remarking that \"wilt not quickly cast it loose? for it is not right nor just that singers should perish by singers' mouths.\" [239]\n\n\nAncient\nHomer, in the Iliad, employs the simile of a stag who, as a victim, is wounded by a human hunter and is then devoured by jackals, who themselves are frightened away by a scavenging lion [238] In the epigram \"The Swallow and the Grasshopper\", attributed to Euenus, the poet writes of a swallow feeding a grasshopper to its young, remarking that \"wilt not quickly cast it loose?

is intended to restyle the appearance of referees and players [10]\n\n\nParticipants\nThe event featured the 16 players who were placed highest in the world rankings after the UK Championship in December 2021 [8] The defending champion was Yan Bingtao, who won the 2021 Masters with a 10–8 victory over John Higgins in the final [14] [15] [16] Yan was seeded first for the event as defending champion The next seven players in the world rankings were seeded and allocated fixed positions in the draw, with the remaining eight participants drawn randomly against them [17]\n\n\nPrize money\nThe winner of the event won £250,000 from a total prize pool of £725,000 The breakdown of prize money for the event is shown below: [21] [22]\n\n\nSummary\nThe first round was played between 9 and 12 January 2022 as the best-of-11 frames [23] In the opening afternoon's match, defending champion Yan faced two-time winner Mark Williams, who had lost in the first round in five of his six previous Masters appearances Yan led 3–1 at the midsession interval, but Williams then won four consecutive frames to lead 5–3 Although Yan made a break of 122 to win the ninth frame, Williams clinched the match 6–4 with an 85 break in the tenth [24] During the evening session, the 2012 champion Neil Robertson, who had lost in the first round on his last two Masters appearances, played Anthony McGill The match began with a 12-minute safety battle before the first pot was made [25] McGill played strongly at the outset, winning the first frame with a break of 78 and making a century in the third frame, but Robertson capitalised on his opponent's errors to win the second and fourth and then made a break of 95 in the fifth frame to lead 3–2 [25] Although McGill tied the scores at 3–3 with a break of 75, Robertson won the next three frames to secure a 6–3 victory [25]\n\n\nFirst round\nThe first round was played between 9 and 12 January 2022 as the best-of-11 frames [23] In the

6–3 victory [25]\n\n\nQuarter-finals\nThe quarter-finals took place on 13 and 14 January as the best-of-11 frames [23] The quarter-finalists comprised six former champions — O'Sullivan, Williams, Higgins, Robertson, Trump and Selby [a] — and two former runners-up — Hawkins, who lost to O'Sullivan in 2016, [40] and Wilson, who lost to Allen in 2018 [41] In the first quarter-final, Robertson began with 202 unanswered points against O'Sullivan, including a break of 119, to go 2–0 ahead O'Sullivan then won the third and fourth frames to level at 2–2 Robertson won the fifth frame, before a 102 break by O'Sullivan, his 80th century break at the Masters Robertson responded with a 130 break to win the seventh frame A 68 break from O'Sullivan in the eighth frame tied the scores at 4–4 but Robertson then won two consecutive frames with breaks of 43, 49, and 54 to complete a 6–4 victory Robertson noted the difficulty of competing at the Masters against O'Sullivan, commenting \" [O'Sullivan] gets the crowd behind him and you get 2,000 people absolutely screaming,\" but stated that his Masters debut against Jimmy White had taught him how to respond in such a situation [42]\n\n\nSemi-finals\nThe semi-finals were played on 15 January as the best-of-11 frames [23] Robertson met Williams in the first semi-final Robertson made a century break to win the opening frame, but he trailed 1–3 at the interval Robertson, however, made breaks of 83, 95 and 119 to win four of the next six to force a deciding frame [54] Helped by a fluke, Williams led by 67 points to 26 in the decider with one red remaining on the table, [55] meaning that Robertson required two snookers [56] After the black ball covered the pocket, with the last red close to the black, Robertson was able to obtain the first of the snookers he required When playing the yellow ball, Williams misjudged a swerve shot, hitting the green ball and giving away another four foul points Robertson then cleared the table to win the match 6–5 [56] After the match, Robertson called the comeback \"the greatest\" of his career [57] The World Snooker Tour ranked the match as number one on its \"Top Ten

The breakdown of prize money for the event was:\n\n* Winner: £250,000\n* Runner-up: £125,000\n* Semi-finalists (2): £62,500 each\n* Quarter-finalists (4): £31,250 each\n* Last 16 (8): £18,750 each\n\n**Summary**\n\nThe first round was played between 9 and 12 January 2022 as the best-of-11 frames. In the opening afternoon's match, defending champion Yan faced two-time winner Mark Williams, who had lost in the first round in five of his six previous Masters appearances. Yan led 3–1 at the midsession interval, but Williams then won four consecutive frames to lead 5–3. Although Yan made a break of 122 to win the ninth frame, Williams clinched the match 6–4 with an 85 break in the tenth.\n\nDuring the evening session, the 2012 champion Neil Robertson, who had lost in the first round on his last two Masters appearances, played Anthony McGill. The match began with a 12-minute safety battle before the first pot was made. McGill played strongly at the outset, winning the first frame with a break of 78 and making a century in the third frame, but Robertson capitalised on his opponent's errors to win the second and fourth and then made a break of 95 in the fifth frame to lead 3–2. Although McGill tied the scores at 3–3 with a break of 75, Robertson won the next three frames to secure a 6–3 victory.\n\n**First round**\n\nThe first round was played between 9 and 12 January 2022 as the best-of-11 frames. The first round was a thrilling affair, with several close matches and some remarkable comebacks. Yan Bingtao, the defending champion, faced Mark Williams in the opening match, but Williams came from behind to win 6–4. Neil Robertson, the 2012 champion, also had a close match against Anthony McGill, but Robertson came out on top 6–3.\n\n**Quarter-finals**\n\nThe quarter-finals took place on 13 and 14 January as the best-of-11 frames. The quarter-finalists comprised six former champions — O'Sullivan, Williams, Higgins, Robertson, Trump, and Selby — and two former runners-up — Hawkins and Wilson. In the first quarter-final, Robertson began with 202 unanswered points against O'Sullivan, including a break of 119, to go 2–0 ahead. O'Sullivan then won the third and fourth frames to level at 2–2. Robertson won the fifth frame, before a 102 break by O'Sullivan, his 80th century break at the Masters. Robertson responded with a 130 break to win the seventh frame. A 68 break from O'Sullivan in the eighth frame tied the scores at 4–4, but Robertson then won two consecutive frames with breaks of 43, 49, and 54 to complete a 6–4 victory.\n\n**Semi-finals**\n\nThe semi-finals were played on 15 January as the best-of-11 frames. Robertson met Williams in the first semi-final. Robertson made a century break to win the opening frame, but he trailed 1–3 at the interval. Robertson, however, made breaks of 83, 95, and 119 to win four of the next six to force a deciding frame. Helped by a fluke, Williams led by 67 points to 26 in the decider with one red remaining on the table, meaning that Robertson required two snookers. After the black ball covered the pocket, with the last red close to the black, Robertson was able to obtain the first of the snookers he required. When playing the yellow ball, Williams misjudged a swerve shot, hitting the green ball and giving away another four foul points. Robertson then cleared the table to win the match 6–5.\n\n**Final**\n\nThe final took place on 16 January as the best-of-19 frames. Robertson met John Higgins in the final, who had been defeated by Yan Bingtao in the final last year. Both players had their moments of brilliance, but Robertson came out on top 10–4 to win the title. The tournament was a thrilling affair, with some remarkable comebacks and close matches. Robertson's victory was his first at the Masters and a testament to his incredible skill and determination.\n\n**Century breaks**\n\nThere were 26 century breaks made during the tournament. The highest was a 139 made by Bingham in his first round loss to Wilson. Other notable century breaks included a 137 by Mark Williams, a 135 by Yan Bingtao, and a 132 by John Higgins.\n\n**Tournament draw**\n\nThe tournament draw was as follows:\n\n|  | Quarter-finals |  |  | Semi-finals |  |  | Final |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |   |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  Robertson 6 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  O'Sullivan 4 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |   |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  Williams 6 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  Bingham 5 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |   |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  McGill 4 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  Selby 6 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |   |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  Trump 2 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  Hawkins 6 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |   |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  Wilson 6 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  Yan 4 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\nThe tournament was a thrilling affair, with some remarkable comebacks and close matches.

The engine was first released in 2004 and has since become a popular tool for researchers, academics, and students to discover and access scholarly content.\n\n**History**\n\nGoogle Scholar arose out of a discussion between Alex Verstak and Anurag Acharya, both of whom were then working on building Google's main web index. Their goal was to \"make the world's problem solvers 10% more efficient\" by allowing easier and more accurate access to scientific knowledge. This goal is reflected in the Google Scholar advertising slogan \"Stand on the shoulders of giants,\" which was taken from an idea attributed to Bernard of Chartres, quoted by Isaac Newton, and is a nod to the scholars who have contributed to their fields over the centuries, providing the foundation for new intellectual achievements.\n\n**Features and Specifications**\n\nGoogle Scholar allows users to search for digital or physical copies of articles, whether online or in libraries. It indexes \"full-text journal articles, technical reports, preprints, theses, books, and other documents, including selected Web pages that are deemed to be 'scholarly.'\" Because many of Google Scholar's search results link to commercial journal articles, most people will be able to access only an abstract and the citation details of an article, and have to pay a fee to access the entire article.\n\nThe most relevant results for the searched keywords will be listed first, in order of the author's ranking, the number of references that are linked to it and their relevance to other scholarly literature, and the ranking of the publication that the journal appears in. This means that users can easily identify the most influential and relevant articles on a particular topic.\n\n**Groups and Access to Literature**\n\nUsing its \"group of\" feature, Google Scholar shows the available links to journal articles. In the 2005 version, this feature provided a link to both subscription-access versions of an article and to free full-text versions of articles. For most of 2006, it provided links to only the publishers' versions. Since December 2006, it has provided links to both published versions and major open access repositories, including all those posted on individual faculty web pages and other unstructured sources identified by similarity.\n\n**Citation Analysis and Tools**\n\nThrough its \"cited by\" feature, Google Scholar provides access to abstracts of articles that have cited the article being viewed. It is this feature in particular that provides the citation indexing previously only found in CiteSeer, Scopus, and Web of Science. Google Scholar also provides links so that citations can be either copied in various formats or imported into user-chosen reference managers such as Zotero.\n\n**Related Articles**\n\nThrough its \"Related articles\" feature, Google Scholar presents a list of closely related articles, ranked primarily by how similar these articles are to the original result, but also taking into account the relevance of each paper. This feature allows users to quickly identify other articles that may be of interest to them.\n\n**US Legal Case Database**\n\nGoogle Scholar's legal database of US cases is extensive. Users can search and read published opinions of US state appellate and supreme court cases since 1950, US federal district, appellate, tax, and bankruptcy courts since 1923, and US Supreme Court cases since 1791. Google Scholar embeds clickable citation links within the case and the How Cited tab allows lawyers to research prior case law and the subsequent citations to the court decision.\n\n**Ranking Algorithm**\n\nWhile most academic databases and search engines allow users to select one factor (e.g. relevance, citation counts, or publication date) to rank results, Google Scholar ranks results with a combined ranking algorithm in a \"way researchers do, weighing the full text of each article, the author, the publication in which the article appears, and how often the piece has been cited in other scholarly literature.\" Research has shown that Google Scholar puts high weight especially on citation counts, as well as words included in a document's title. In searches by author or year, the first search results are often highly cited articles, as the number of citations is highly determinant, whereas in keyword searches the number of citations is probably the factor with the most weight, but other factors also participate.\n\n**Limitations and Criticism**\n\nSome searchers found Google Scholar to be of comparable quality and utility to subscription-based databases when looking at citations of articles in some specific journals. The reviews recognize that its \"cited by\" feature in particular poses serious competition to Scopus and Web of Science. A study looking at the biomedical field found citation information in Google Scholar to be \"sometimes inadequate, and less often updated.\" The coverage of Google Scholar may vary by discipline compared to other general databases. Google Scholar strives to include as many journals as possible, including predatory journals, which may lack academic rigor. Specialists on predatory journals say that these kinds of journals \"have polluted the global scientific record with pseudo-science\" and \"that Google Scholar dutifully and perhaps blindly includes in its central index.\"\n\n**Search Engine Optimization for Google Scholar**\n\nSearch engine optimization (SEO) for traditional web search engines such as Google has been popular for many years. For several years, SEO has also been applied to academic search engines such as Google Scholar. SEO for academic articles is also called \"academic search engine optimization\" (ASEO) and defined as \"the creation, publication, and modification of scholarly literature in a way that makes it easier for academic search engines to both crawl it and index it.\" ASEO has been adopted by several organizations, among them Elsevier, OpenScience, Mendeley, and SAGE Publishing, to optimize their articles' rankings in Google Scholar. ASEO has negatives.\n\n**See Also**\n\nGoogle Scholar has been instrumental in making scholarly literature more accessible to a wider audience. Its features, such as citation analysis and related articles, have revolutionized the way researchers and academics work. While it has its limitations and criticisms, Google Scholar remains a valuable tool for anyone looking to access and analyze scholarly content.\n\n**Further Reading**\n\nFor those interested in learning more about Google Scholar and its features, there are several resources available. The official Google Scholar help center provides detailed information on how to use the engine, including tutorials and FAQs. There are also several academic papers and articles that discuss the impact of Google Scholar on the academic community and its limitations.\n\n**External Links**\n\nGoogle Scholar Official Website: https://scholar.google.com/\nGoogle Scholar Help Center: https://scholar.google.com/intl/en/scholar/help.html", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Google_Scholar\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nGoogle Scholar arose out of a discussion between Alex Verstak and Anurag Acharya, [8] both of whom were then working on building Google's main web index [9] [10] Their goal was to \"make the world's problem solvers 10% more efficient\" [11] by allowing easier and more accurate access to scientific knowledge This goal is reflected in the Google Scholar's advertising slogan \"Stand on the shoulders of giants\", which was taken from an idea attributed to Bernard of Chartres, quoted by Isaac Newton, and is a nod to the scholars who have contributed to their fields over the centuries, providing the foundation for new intellectual achievements [12] One of the sources for the texts in Google Scholar is the University of Michigan's print collection [6]\n\n\nFeatures and specifications\nGoogle Scholar allows users to search for digital or physical copies of articles, whether online or in libraries [23] It indexes \"full-text journal articles, technical reports, preprints, theses, books, and other documents, including selected Web pages that are deemed to be 'scholarly.'\" [24] Because many of Google Scholar's search results link to commercial journal articles, most people will be able to access only an abstract and the citation details of an article, and have to pay a fee to access the entire article [24] The most relevant results for the searched keywords will be listed first, in order of the author's ranking, the number of references that are linked to it and their relevance to other scholarly literature, and the ranking of the publication that the journal appears in [25]\n\n\nGroups and access to literature\nUsing its \"group of\" feature, it shows the available links to journal articles In the 2005 version, this feature provided a link to both subscription-access versions of an article and to free full-text versions of articles; for most of 2006, it provided links to only the publishers' versions Since December 2006, it has provided links to both published versions and major open access repositories, including all those posted on individual faculty web pages and other unstructured sources identified by similarity On the other hand, Google Scholar does not allow to filter explicitly between toll access and open access resources, a feature offered Unpaywall and the tools which embed its data, such as Web of Science, Scopus and Unpaywall Journals, used by libraries to calculate the real costs and value of their collections [26]\n\n\nCitation analysis and tools\nThrough its \"cited by\" feature, Google Scholar provides access to abstracts of articles that have cited the article being viewed [27] It is this feature in particular that provides the citation indexing previously only found in CiteSeer, Scopus, and Web of Science Google Scholar also provides links so that citations can be either copied in various formats or imported into user-chosen reference managers such as Zotero.\n\n\nRelated articles\nThrough its \"Related articles\" feature, Google Scholar presents a list of closely related articles, ranked primarily by how similar these articles are to the original result, but also taking into account the relevance of each paper [28]\n\n\nUS legal case database\nGoogle Scholar's legal database of US cases is extensive Users can search and read published opinions of US state appellate and supreme court cases since 1950, US federal district, appellate, tax, and bankruptcy courts since 1923 and US Supreme Court cases since 1791 [27] Google Scholar embeds clickable citation links within the case and the How Cited tab allows lawyers to research prior case law and the subsequent citations to the court decision [29]\n\n\nRanking algorithm\nWhile most academic databases and search engines allow users to select one factor (e.g relevance, citation counts, or publication date) to rank results, Google Scholar ranks results with a combined ranking algorithm in a \"way researchers do, weighing the full text of each article, the author, the publication in which the article appears, and how often the piece has been cited in other scholarly literature\" [25] Research has shown that Google Scholar puts high weight especially on citation counts, [30] as well as words included in a document's title [31] In searches by author or year, the first search results are often highly cited articles, as the number of citations is highly determinant, whereas in keyword searches the number of citations is probably the factor with the most weight, but other factors also participate [32]\n\n\nLimitations and criticism\nSome searchers found Google Scholar to be of comparable quality and utility to subscription-based databases when looking at citations of articles in some specific journals [33] [34] The reviews recognize that its \"cited by\" feature in particular poses serious competition to Scopus and Web of Science A study looking at the biomedical field found citation information in Google Scholar to be \"sometimes inadequate, and less often updated\" [35] The coverage of Google Scholar may vary by discipline compared to other general databases [36] Google Scholar strives to include as many journals as possible, including predatory journals, which may lack academic rigor Specialists on predatory journals say that these kinds of journals \"have polluted the global scientific record with pseudo-science\" and \"that Google Scholar dutifully and perhaps blindly includes in its central index.\" [37]\n\n\nSearch engine optimization for Google Scholar\nSearch engine optimization (SEO) for traditional web search engines such as Google has been popular for many years For several years, SEO has also been applied to academic search engines such as Google Scholar [53]  SEO for academic articles is also called \"academic search engine optimization\" (ASEO) and defined as \"the creation, publication, and modification of scholarly literature in a way that makes it easier for academic search engines to both crawl it and index it\" [53] ASEO has been adopted by several organizations, among them Elsevier, [54] OpenScience, [55] Mendeley, [56] and SAGE Publishing, [57] to optimize their articles' rankings in Google Scholar ASEO has negatives [46]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

president of the conference, but she was removed on 31 January 2020, several months after she had stepped down as an MP [10] [11] Former Prime Minister David Cameron and former Foreign Secretary William Hague declined to take the role [12] On 13 February 2020, Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Secretary Alok Sharma was appointed [13] On 8 January 2021, Sharma was succeeded by Kwasi Kwarteng as Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Secretary and moved to the Cabinet Office, in order to focus on the presidency full-time [14]\n\n\nPostponement\nBecause of the COVID-19 pandemic, in April 2020 the conference was postponed to 31 October – 12 November 2021 [3] [18] Both host countries, Italy and the UK, were heavily affected by the pandemic, and the venue of the conference, the SEC Centre in Glasgow, was converted in May 2020 into a temporary hospital for COVID-19 patients in Scotland [19]\n\n\nSponsors\nPrevious summits have been sponsored by fossil fuel companies To reduce this influence, the UK government decided that sponsors \"have to have real commitments in place to help them reach net zero in the near future\" [27] The first principal partners included three British energy companies and a banking and insurance company [28]\n\n\nLocation and participation\nBefore the summit councils in and around Glasgow pledged to plant 18 million trees during the following decade: the Clyde Climate Forest (CCF) is projected to increase tree coverage in the urban areas of the Greater Glasgow region to 20% [29]\n\n\nMedical cover\nThe provision of medical services for the event was provided by BASICS Scotland, Amvale Medical and the Scottish Ambulance Service The medical centre was visited by both Scottish National Clinical Director Jason Leitch and Scottish Health Secretary Humza Yousaf during the conference [40] [41]\n\n\nAttendees\nTwenty-five thousand delegates from nearly 200 countries were expected to attend, [42] [43] and around 120 heads of state came [44] Among the attendees were UN secretary-general António Guterres, United States president Joe Biden, Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau, Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte, Egyptian president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, French president Emmanuel Macron, German chancellor Angela Merkel, Spanish prime minister Pedro Sánchez, Indian prime minister Narendra Modi, Indonesian president Joko Widodo, Israeli prime minister Naftali Bennett, Japanese prime minister Fumio Kishida, Nigerian president Muhammadu Buhari, Polish prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki, Swedish prime minister Stefan Löfven, and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky [45] [46] Former United States president Barack Obama [47] [48] and English broadcaster and natural historian David Attenborough, who was named COP26 People's Advocate, spoke at the summit [49]\n\n\nNon-attendees\nIn October 2021, China's leader Xi Jinping announced he would not be attending the conference in person [56] and instead delivered a written address as the organizers did not provide an opportunity for a video address [57] With greenhouse gas emissions by China being the world's largest, Reuters said this made it less likely the conference would result in a significant climate deal [58] However, a Chinese delegation led by climate change envoy Xie Zhenhua did attend [59] The 2021 global energy crisis intensified pressures on China ahead of the summit [60] [61] The prime ministers or heads of state of South Africa, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Mexico, Brazil, Turkey, Malaysia and Vatican City also did not attend the meeting [62] [63] [64] [65]\n\n\nRatchet mechanism\nUnder the Paris Agreement, countries submitted pledges called nationally determined contributions, to limit their greenhouse gas emissions Under the framework of the Paris Agreement, each country is expected to submit enhanced nationally determined contributions every five years, to ratchet up the ambition to mitigate climate change [79] When the Paris Agreement was signed at COP21, the conference of 2020 was set to be the first ratcheting up Even though the 2020 conference was postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, dozens of countries still had not updated their pledges by early October 2021 [80] Collective progress towards implementation of the Paris Agreement in mitigation, adaptation and finance flows and means of implementation and support will be measured by global stocktakes, the first of which is due to be completed in 2023 [81]\n\n\nOutcomes\nOn 13 November 2021, the participating 197 countries agreed to a new deal, known as the Glasgow Climate Pact, aimed at staving off dangerous climate change [82]\n\n\nNegotiations\nThe world leaders' summit was on 1 and 2 November, with each leader giving a national statement [101]\n\n\nDeforestation\nLeaders of more than 100 countries with around 85% of the world's forests, including Canada, Russia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the United States, [109] agreed to end deforestation by 2030, improving on a similar 2014 agreement by now including Brazil, [110] Indonesia, [111] businesses [112] and more financial resources [113] Signatories of the 2014 agreement, the New York Declaration on Forests, pledged to half deforestation by 2020 and end it by 2030; however, in the 2014–2020 period deforestation increased [109]\n\n\nArticle 6\nArticle 6 of the Paris Agreement, which describes rules for an international carbon market (such as for trees in the deforestation agreement [112]) and other forms of international cooperation, is being discussed as it is the last piece of the rulebook remaining to be finalized [115] Although the parties have agreed in principle to avoid double counting of emission reduction across more than one country's greenhouse gas inventory, exactly how much double counting will actually occur remains unclear [115] Carrying forward pre-2020 Kyoto carbon credits will be discussed, but is highly unlikely to be agreed [116] Therefore, Article 6 rules could make a big difference to future emissions [116]\n\n\nFinance\nClimate finance for adaptation and mitigation was one of the principal topics of negotiation [117] Poor countries want more money for adaptation, whereas donors prefer to finance mitigation as that has a chance of making a profit [118] Appointed to the role of Climate Finance Adviser was Mark Carney, former Governor of the Bank of England [119] The Paris agreement included US$100 billion annually in finance by 2020 for developing countries [120] However, wealthy countries failed to live up to that promise, with members of the OECD behind in their commitments and unlikely to reach the agreed amount before 2023 [121] A group of large finance companies committed to net zero portfolios and loan books by 2050 [122] Scotland became the first country to contribute to a loss and damage fund [123]\n\n\nCoal\nSouth Africa is set to receive $8.5 billion to end its reliance on coal, details are sparse regarding capping mines, exports and local community support for the workers in the industry [124] [125] Countries including Chile, Poland, Ukraine, South Korea, Indonesia and Vietnam also agreed to phase out coal in the 2030s for major economies, and the 2040s for poorer nations [126] These nations include some of the world's most intensive users of coal [127] However, they do not include the world's largest users of the fuel, China, India, and the United States of America [127]\nJapan is to invest $100 million in the transformation of fossil-fired plants into ones based on ammonia and hydrogen fuel [128]\n\n\nMethane\nThe US and many other countries agreed to limit methane emissions [129] More than 80 countries signed up to a global methane pledge, agreeing to cut emissions by 30% by the end of the decade The US and European leaders say tackling the potent greenhouse gas is crucial to keeping warming limited to 1.5 °C (2.7 °F) [130] Australia, China, Russia, India and Iran did not sign the deal, but it is hoped more countries will join later [113]\n\n\nNet-zero targets\nMany attendees committed to net-zero carbon emissions, with India and Japan making specific commitments at the conference India, the third-largest emitter of carbon dioxide by jurisdiction, set the latest target date planning to be net-zero by 2070 Japan is to offer up to $10 billion in additional funding to support decarbonization in Asia [132] [133] [134] Earlier in October, China—the largest emitter of carbon dioxide by jurisdiction—had committed to net-zero carbon emissions by 2060, [135] and it was believed by the British government that India would issue a similar commitment [136] However, this was the first time that a date for carbon neutrality had been given as part of India's climate policy [137] Green hydrogen has emerged as one of the major areas where companies can collaborate to help decarbonize hard to abate industries [138]\n\n\nAdaptation\nBig city mayors concerned about climate—the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group—such as Istanbul Mayor Ekrem İmamoğlu, [139] called for more urban climate adaptation, especially in low-income countries [140]\n\n\nSocioeconomic transformation\n45 countries, including the UK, U.S., Japan, Germany, India, Indonesia, Morocco, Vietnam, Philippines, Gabon, Ethiopia, Ghana and Uruguay, pledged to give more than $4 billion for transition to sustainable agriculture The organization \"Slow

Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). It was held in Glasgow, Scotland, from 31 October to 12 November 2021. The conference was a major international event aimed at addressing the pressing issue of climate change and its impact on the environment and human societies.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe United Kingdom held the presidency of COP26 until the start of COP27. Initially, the Minister of State for Energy and Clean Growth, Claire Perry, was appointed as president of the conference, but she was removed on 31 January 2020, several months after she had stepped down as an MP. Former Prime Minister David Cameron and former Foreign Secretary William Hague declined to take the role. On 13 February 2020, Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Secretary Alok Sharma was appointed. On 8 January 2021, Sharma was succeeded by Kwasi Kwarteng as Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Secretary and moved to the Cabinet Office, in order to focus on the presidency full-time.\n\n**Presidency**\n\nThe presidency of COP26 was held by the United Kingdom. The conference was chaired by Alok Sharma, who was succeeded by Kwasi Kwarteng as Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Secretary in January 2021.\n\n**Postponement**\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the conference was postponed from November 2020 to October-November 2021. The postponement was announced in April 2020, and the new dates were confirmed in May 2020. The venue of the conference, the SEC Centre in Glasgow, was converted in May 2020 into a temporary hospital for COVID-19 patients in Scotland.\n\n**Sponsors**\n\nPrevious summits have been sponsored by fossil fuel companies. To reduce this influence, the UK government decided that sponsors \"have to have real commitments in place to help them reach net zero in the near future\". The first principal partners included three British energy companies and a banking and insurance company.\n\n**Location and Participation**\n\nBefore the summit, councils in and around Glasgow pledged to plant 18 million trees during the following decade. The Clyde Climate Forest (CCF) is projected to increase tree coverage in the urban areas of the Greater Glasgow region to 20%.\n\n**Medical Cover**\n\nThe provision of medical services for the event was provided by BASICS Scotland, Amvale Medical, and the Scottish Ambulance Service. The medical centre was visited by both Scottish National Clinical Director Jason Leitch and Scottish Health Secretary Humza Yousaf during the conference.\n\n**Attendees**\n\nTwenty-five thousand delegates from nearly 200 countries were expected to attend, and around 120 heads of state came. Among the attendees were UN Secretary-General António Guterres, United States President Joe Biden, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Indonesian President Joko Widodo, Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Löfven, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Former United States President Barack Obama and English broadcaster and natural historian David Attenborough, who was named COP26 People's Advocate, spoke at the summit.\n\n**Non-attendees**\n\nIn October 2021, China's leader Xi Jinping announced he would not be attending the conference in person and instead delivered a written address as the organizers did not provide an opportunity for a video address. With greenhouse gas emissions by China being the world's largest, Reuters said this made it less likely the conference would result in a significant climate deal. However, a Chinese delegation led by climate change envoy Xie Zhenhua did attend. The prime ministers or heads of state of South Africa, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Mexico, Brazil, Turkey, Malaysia, and Vatican City also did not attend the meeting.\n\n**Ratchet Mechanism**\n\nUnder the Paris Agreement, countries submitted pledges called nationally determined contributions, to limit their greenhouse gas emissions. Under the framework of the Paris Agreement, each country is expected to submit enhanced nationally determined contributions every five years, to ratchet up the ambition to mitigate climate change. When the Paris Agreement was signed at COP21, the conference of 2020 was set to be the first ratcheting up. Even though the 2020 conference was postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, dozens of countries still had not updated their pledges by early October 2021.\n\n**Outcomes**\n\nOn 13 November 2021, the participating 197 countries agreed to a new deal, known as the Glasgow Climate Pact, aimed at staving off dangerous climate change.\n\n**Negotiations**\n\nThe world leaders' summit was on 1 and 2 November, with each leader giving a national statement.\n\n**Deforestation**\n\nLeaders of more than 100 countries with around 85% of the world's forests, including Canada, Russia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the United States, agreed to end deforestation by 2030, improving on a similar 2014 agreement by now including Brazil, Indonesia, businesses, and more financial resources.\n\n**Article 6**\n\nArticle 6 of the Paris Agreement, which describes rules for an international carbon market (such as for trees in the deforestation agreement) and other forms of international cooperation, is being discussed as it is the last piece of the rulebook remaining to be finalized.\n\n**Finance**\n\nClimate finance for adaptation and mitigation was one of the principal topics of negotiation. Poor countries want more money for adaptation, whereas donors prefer to finance mitigation as that has a chance of making a profit. Appointed to the role of Climate Finance Adviser was Mark Carney, former Governor of the Bank of England. The Paris agreement included $100 billion annually in finance by 2020 for developing countries. However, wealthy countries failed to live up to that promise, with members of the OECD behind in their commitments and unlikely to reach the agreed amount before 2023. A group of large finance companies committed to net zero portfolios and loan books by 2050.\n\n**Coal**\n\nSouth Africa is set to receive $8.5 billion to end its reliance on coal, details are sparse regarding capping mines, exports, and local community support for the workers in the industry. Countries including Chile, Poland, Ukraine, South Korea, Indonesia, and Vietnam also agreed to phase out coal in the 2030s for major economies, and the 2040s for poorer nations.\n\n**Methane**\n\nThe US and many other countries agreed to limit methane emissions. More than 80 countries signed up to a global methane pledge, agreeing to cut emissions by 30% by the end of the decade. The US and European leaders say tackling the potent greenhouse gas is crucial to keeping warming limited to 1.5°C (2.7°F).\n\n**Net-zero targets**\n\nMany attendees committed to net-zero carbon emissions, with India and Japan making specific commitments at the conference. India, the third-largest emitter of carbon dioxide by jurisdiction, set the latest target date planning to be net-zero by 2070. Japan is to offer up to $10 billion in additional funding to support decarbonization in Asia.\n\n**Adaptation**\n\nBig city mayors concerned about climate—the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group—such as Istanbul Mayor Ekrem İmamoğlu, called for more urban climate adaptation, especially in low-income countries.\n\n**Socioeconomic transformation**\n\n45 countries, including the UK, US, Japan, Germany, India, Indonesia, Morocco, Vietnam, Philippines, Gabon, Ethiopia, Ghana, and Uruguay, pledged to give more than $4 billion for transition to sustainable agriculture.\n\n**Transportation**\n\nThe conference placed electric vehicles and pledges for vehicle electrification at the centre, including the electric OX truck, while, according to activists, better investment and political will for sustainable transport modes have not been forced through with the focus not being on public transport and cycling.\n\n**Fossil fuels**\n\nA draft text published on 10 November asked governments to accelerate phase-outs and desubsidization of fossil fuels, the largest source of (anthropogenic) global greenhouse gas emissions, but was opposed by several countries with large fossil fuels-based economic sectors.\n\n**Reception**\n\nBusiness leaders and politicians including Jeff Bezos, Prince Charles, Boris Johnson, Joe Biden, and Angela Merkel who travelled to Glasgow in private airplanes were accused of hypocrisy by commentators and campaigners. Event planners, however, insisted that the conference would be carbon-neutral. Around 400 private jets arrived at Glasgow for the talks.\n\n**Protests**\n\nBy 1 November, at the outset of the conference, the climate change activist Greta Thunberg criticized the summit at a protest in Glasgow with members from the organization Fridays for Future, saying \"This COP26 is so far just like the previous COPs and that has led us nowhere. They have led us nowhere.\"\n\n**Event organisation**\n\nOne intended participant, the Israeli energy minister Karine Elharrar, was unable to attend on 1 November due to wheelchair accessibility issues.\n\n**Further criticism**\n\nFurther criticisms of the results include that it needs not only commitments but also clear directions for mitigation and adaptation and robust mechanisms put in place for the relevant parties to be held accountable to their commitments.

global stocktakes, the first of which is due to be completed in 2023 [81]\n\n\nOutcomes\nOn 13 November 2021, the participating 197 countries agreed to a new deal, known as the Glasgow Climate Pact,

how much double counting will actually occur remains unclear [115] Carrying forward pre-2020 Kyoto carbon credits will be discussed, but is highly unlikely to be agreed [116] Therefore, Article 6 rules could make a big difference to future emissions [116]\n\n\nFinance\nClimate finance for adaptation and mitigation was one of the principal topics of negotiation [117] Poor countries want more

The stadium has undergone significant transformations over the years, from its humble beginnings to its current status as a world-class cricket venue. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the stadium's history, design, and facilities, as well as its notable achievements and events.\n\n**History**\n\nPrior to 1982, international cricket matches in Ahmedabad were played at Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Stadium (located in Navrangpura), owned by the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation. The stadium became a focal venue of the ICC Champions Trophy in 2006, hosting five of the 15 games played. In preparation for the tournament, the stadium was renovated to add three new pitches and a new outfield, as well as floodlights and covered stands.\n\n**2006-2015**\n\nThe stadium was further renovated in 2014-2015, with the Gujarat Cricket Association (GCA) planning to build a new stadium. The idea was reportedly proposed by Narendra Modi, the president of the GCA and the Chief Minister of Gujarat at the time. Shortly before Modi moved to Delhi after becoming the Prime Minister of India, there were discussions about adding minor upgrades to the stadium and further developing areas of the structure at the pavilion end. Modi asked officials to build a new, larger stadium instead of pursuing minor renovation work.\n\n**Conception**\n\nThe idea to build a new stadium was reportedly proposed by Narendra Modi, the president of the GCA and the Chief Minister of Gujarat at the time. The new stadium was designed to be a state-of-the-art facility, with a seating capacity of over 132,000 spectators. The stadium was built on 63 acres of land and has 4 entry points, with a metro line at one of the entry points.\n\n**Bids**\n\nAfter starting demolition work at the end of 2015, the GCA issued a request for tender on 1 January 2016. Nine bidders showed interest and purchased the tender documents, out of which three submitted technical and financial bids on time. They were the Shapoorji Pallonji Group, Nagarjuna Construction Company, and Larsen & Toubro (L&T). A Tender Commercial Committee (TCC) of nine experts was formed to evaluate tenders. STUP Consultants, a civil engineering consultancy firm based in Mumbai, was appointed as the project management consultant to evaluate proposals and technical details of each bid working with the TCC.\n\n**Building work**\n\nL&T took over the construction work of the stadium in December 2016. On 16 January 2017, the Gujarat Cricket Association oversaw the project, which formally began on the same day. The stadium was planned to be finished in 2 years, and the reconstruction project was estimated to cost around ₹700 crore ($93 million). Final completion of the stadium was finished in February 2020, and it hosted an England-India day-night test match in 2021.\n\n**2020-present**\n\nIn 2020, the event \"Namaste Trump\" was organized at the stadium for the visit of US President Donald J. Trump to India. 125,000 attendees were recorded. In February 2021, it was announced that the stadium would be renamed \"Narendra Modi Stadium\". Congress initially criticized the decision, before it was made clear that the complex would continue to hold the name \"Sardar Patel Sports Enclave\" and only the stadium would receive a new name.\n\n**Tournament results**\n\nThe stadium is built on 63 acres of land and has 4 entry points, with a metro line at one of the entry points. It has 76 corporate boxes that can hold 25 persons each, a 55-room clubhouse, an Olympic-size swimming pool, and four dressing rooms. A food court and hospitality area are available in each spectator stand. The stadium also includes an indoor cricket academy and practice pitches, with dormitories for 40 athletes.\n\n**Cricket World Cup**\n\nThe stadium is built on 63 acres of land and has 4 entry points, with a metro line at one of the entry points.

Trump to India by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The event mirrored the \"Howdy Modi\" event held in Houston, Texas.\n\n**75 years of Friendship through Cricket Event**\n\nOn 9 March 2023, Narendra Modi Stadium hosted the 75 Years of Friendship through Cricket Event, which was attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and visiting Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.

Born on July 31, 1991, to Jagdeep Advani, a Sindhi Hindu businessman, and Genevieve Jaffrey, a teacher, Kiara comes from a family with a strong background in the arts. Her maternal family is connected to several celebrities, including actors Ashok Kumar and Saeed Jaffrey, who are her step-great-grandfather and great-uncle, respectively.\n\nEarly Life\n----------\n\nAdvani was born and raised in Mumbai, India. Her parents divorced when she was young, and she was raised by her mother, who is of Scottish, Irish, Portuguese, and Spanish ancestry. Kiara's younger brother, Mishaal, is a musician, and the siblings grew up in a close-knit family. Advani's family moved to various locations in India, including Lucknow, where her maternal grandfather was from.\n\nCareer\n------\n\n### Early Work (2014-2019)\n\nAdvani began her acting career with the Hindi ensemble comedy film Fugly (2014), which was her debut film. The movie received mixed reviews from critics, but Advani's performance was praised by many. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama wrote, \"Kiara Advani catches you completely unaware\" and has the \"combination of looks and talent.\" Mehul S Thakkar of Deccan Chronicle found her \"very striking\" and said that she \"shows a lot of promise.\" Although Fugly underperformed at the box office, Advani's performance was noticed, and she continued to work in the industry.\n\n### Rise to Prominence (2019-Present)\n\nAdvani received wider attention later in 2019 for Sandeep Reddy Vanga's romantic drama Kabir Singh, starring Shahid Kapoor. The film had a worldwide gross of over ₹378 crore (US$45 million), becoming her highest-grossing release. However, critics panned the film due to its depiction of misogyny and toxic masculinity. Rajeev Masand bemoaned that her passive character \"offers the actress little to work with.\" Despite the controversy, Kabir Singh grossed over ₹200 crores domestically, ranking among the year's highest-grossing films.\n\nAdvani then starred in the comedy Good Newwz alongside Akshay Kumar, Kareena Kapoor Khan, and Diljit Dosanjh. The movie follows two couples who try to conceive a child through in vitro fertilization.

He is known for his agility and ability to change direction quickly when in possession of the ball, allowing him to beat opponents in one-on-one situations. Rodrygo's low center of gravity, combined with his dribbling skills, makes him a challenging opponent to defend against.\n\nRodrygo has also been praised for his decision-making, offensive positioning, finishing, link-up play, and creativity, which allows him to hold-up the ball and create space or chances for his teammates, in addition to scoring goals himself. He has also been noted for his work-rate and willingness to press opponents.\n\n## Positions\n\nRodrygo is normally used as a right-winger but is a versatile player who has been used in several other positions, including on the left. He has also been used in a free role as a right-sided forward or striker in a 4-3-1-2 formation by manager Carlo Ancelotti. In this position, he operated in more central areas at times but was still given the freedom to move out wide to overload the flanks or switch positions and link-up with Vinícius on the other side of the pitch.\n\n## Personal Life\n\nRodrygo and Brazilian beautician Pamella Cristina Costa welcomed twin sons in February 2022.\n\n## Career Statistics\n\nAs of the 2023-24 season, Rodrygo has played 105 games for Real Madrid, scoring 23 goals and providing 24 assists. He has also made 12 appearances for Brazil, scoring 2 goals.\n\n## Honours\n\nWith Real Madrid, Rodrygo has won the La Liga title, the Copa del Rey, and the UEFA Champions League.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Rodrygo\" following this outline:\n\n\nClub career\nBorn in Osasco, São Paulo, Rodrygo joined Santos' youth setup in 2011 at the age of ten, initially assigned to the futsal team [2] Rodrygo traveled the world with Santos, spreading his beloved game of futsal under legendary futsal coach Barata who also trained Neymar, including a much heralded YouTube video with City Futsal in Dallas area in Texas, USA In March 2017, with the first team regulars in Peru for a Copa Libertadores match against Sporting Cristal, he was called up to the first team by manager Dorival Júnior to complete training [6]\n\n\nSantos\nBorn in Osasco, São Paulo, Rodrygo joined Santos' youth setup in 2011 at the age of ten, initially assigned to the futsal team [2] Rodrygo traveled the world with Santos, spreading his beloved game of futsal under legendary futsal coach Barata who also trained Neymar, including a much heralded YouTube video with City Futsal in Dallas area in Texas, USA In March 2017, with the first team regulars in Peru for a Copa Libertadores match against Sporting Cristal, he was called up to the first team by manager Dorival Júnior to complete training [6]\n\n\nReal Madrid\nOn 15 June 2018, Real Madrid reached an agreement with Santos for the transfer of Rodrygo, with the player joining Los Blancos in June 2019 and signing until 2025 [18] [19] The rumoured fee was of €45 million, [20] with Santos receiving €40 million as the club owned 80% of his rights with the rest owned by Rodrygo's agents [21]\n\n\nInternational career\nOn 30 March 2017, Rodrygo was called up to Brazil under-17s for the year's Montaigu Tournament [36] He made his debut in the championship by scoring his side's only goal in a 2–1 loss against Denmark, and netted two more against Cameroon and United States [37]\n\n\nStyle of play\nConsidered to be a talented and highly promising young player in the media, and one of the best players in the world, Rodrygo's playing style has been likened to that of compatriot and Real Madrid team-mate Vinícius Júnior, due to their pace, technical skill, and similar direct style in attack Although he does not possess significant physical strength or athleticism, due to his diminutive stature, Rodrygo's low centre of gravity, combined with his dribbling skills and resulting agility, allow him to change direction quickly when in possession of the ball, and beat opponents in one on one situations He has also been noted for his decision-making, offensive positioning, finishing, link-up play, and creativity, which allows him to hold-up the ball and create space or chances for his teammates, in addition to scoring goals himself He has also been praised by pundits for his work-rate and willingness to press opponents While he normally plays as a right-winger, he is a versatile player, who has been used in several other positions, including on the left, and was also used in a free role as a right-sided forward or striker in a 4–3–1–2 formation during the 2023–24 season by manager Carlo Ancelotti; in this position, although he operated in more central areas at times, he was still given the freedom to move out wide to overload the flanks, or switch positions and link-up with Vinícius on the other side of the pitch Although he is naturally right-footed, Rodrygo does not normally play as an inverted winger on the opposite flank, in contrast to many other wingers of his era [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51]\n\n\nPersonal life\nRodrygo and Brazilian beautician Pamella Cristina Costa welcomed twin sons in February 2022 [52]\n\n\nCareer statistics\nReal Madrid\n\n\nClub\nReal Madrid\n\n\nInternational\nReal Madrid\n\n\nHonours\nReal Madrid\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

So, you know, stop throwing rocks from the sidelines and get in there and try to do something positive.\" [34] When the rights were acquired by Blumhouse, filmmaker Adam Wingard discussed making a new Halloween film, but ultimately dropped out after being sated by an email of encouragement from Carpenter, \"I kinda walked away from it like, I just got everything I wanted out of this job 'This is about as good as it gets.'\" [35] On February 9, 2017, David Gordon Green and Danny McBride were announced as handling screenwriting duties, with Green directing and Carpenter advising the project [36] Carpenter said that he was impressed with the pitch presented by the co-writers, solicited by Jason Blum, proclaiming that \"They get it.\" [37] Green and McBride brought along their UNCSA colleague Jeff Fradley to co-write the script alongside them [38]\n\n\nCasting\nIn September 2017, Jamie Lee Curtis confirmed that she would reprise her role as Laurie Strode [51] [52] In contrast to the character's final girl role in the original film, Laurie armed herself and prepared extensively in the time period between films in case Michael Myers returned [53] Although Halloween II and its later installments have portrayed Myers as a familicidal killer and Laurie as his sister, the writers felt that the added motive made him less frightening as a killer As such, they intentionally ignored that aspect of the lore [54] In the film, Laurie's granddaughter Allyson explains how her life has been impacted by Michael's homicidal rampage 40 years earlier When a friend hints that he had heard Michael was Laurie's brother, Allyson replies, \"No, it was not her brother That was something people made up.\" [55] The writers did not originally know if Curtis would be willing to return, according to McBride, so they \"busted  [their] ass on this script to really make that Laurie Strode character something she wouldn't be able to say no to.\" [5] On why she returned, Curtis stated, \"As soon as I read what David Green and Danny McBride had come up with  [...] and the way that they connected the dots of the story, it made so much sense to me that it felt totally appropriate for me to return to Haddonfield, Ill., for another 40th-anniversary retelling It's the original story in many, many, many ways Just retold 40 years later with my granddaughter.\" [56] Curtis had previously returned as Laurie in the sequels Halloween II (1981), Halloween H20: 20 Years Later (1998), and Halloween: Resurrection (2002) The following October, Judy Greer entered negotiations to

October 2017 It got delayed until January 13, 2018 and began in Charleston, South Carolina [76] [77] [78] Michael Simmonds served cinematography duties, with Paul Daley and Stewart Cantrell operating the camera [67] According to Danny McBride, the horror of the film aims to create a sense of tension and dread to the audience rather than relying on graphic violence; [79] the make-up and visual effects were provided by Christopher Nelson [64] Jamie Lee Curtis finished her scenes on February 16, 2018, [80] with the remaining principal photography concluding on February 19, 2018 [81] [82] Response to the film's first test screening led the filmmakers to schedule reshoots beginning June 11, 2018 Filming once again took place in Charleston [83]\n\n\nMusic\nAfter previously providing the score for the original Halloween, Halloween II, and Halloween III: Season of the Witch, John Carpenter confirmed in October 2017 that he had made a deal to score the 2018 release Regarding his take on the sequel, he said, \"I'll be consulting with the director to see what he feels I could create a new score, we could update the old score and amplify it, or we could combine those two things I'll have to see the movie to see what it requires.\" [86] The album was released on October 19, 2018 [87]\n\n\nRelease\nHalloween had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on

July 20, 2018, with Jamie Lee Curtis, David Gordon Green, Malek Akkad, and Jason Blum in attendance [91] During the panel, which featured an extended scene and trailer, Curtis discussed how the film ties in with the MeToo movement, describing it as a film about \"trauma\", stating, \" [Laurie's] taking back her narrative She has carried the trauma and PTSD of someone who was attacked  [...] And there comes a point where you say, I am not a victim And this is a person who has been waiting 40 years  [for the chance].\" [92] The first trailer for the film was released on June 8, 2018, followed

who helped with Oseman's Kickstarter campaign in 2018 [7] She expressed interest in doing it, noting the lack of wholesome, teenage LGBT representation on television, hoping that this could potentially assure LGBT youth \"that they can find happiness and find romance and find friendship\" She wrote a screenplay based on the first two volumes of the graphic novel See-Saw Films liked it

Daniel Edwards served as casting director An open casting call went out in January and February 2021 for five of the main characters and three of the recurring cast [14] Oseman explained that the character Aled Last would not appear in the adaptation to respect his story in another novel within the Heartstopper universe, Radio Silence After over 10,000 people auditioned via Zoom, she announced the first round of casting decisions in April 2021, with Kit Connor and Joe Locke starring as Nick and Charlie respectively [6] [15] Heartstopper marked Locke's acting debut [16] After agreeing that Locke suited Charlie's role, Connor was auditioned and the production team found chemistry between the two; [10] the actors themselves recalled only taking a few hours to bond

lovebirds are also seen Oseman said that the animations represent a \"feeling of magic\" they intended to evoke She had already thought of using such effects while writing the screenplay, conceiving that they would appear primarily during the intimate scenes between Nick and Charlie, which she dubbed \"Heartstopper moments\" Eventually, Anna Peronetto was chosen to create the animations, using a storyboard by Oseman Peronetto had been a fan of the original source material and was chosen when Oseman made an Instagram post looking for traditional animators She discussed with Lyn and editor Sofie Alonzi to see what kinds of animations fit in a certain scene For the lovebirds, she analysed London feral parakeets [30] [48] [49]\n\n\nMusic\nAdiescar Chase composed the original score and employed electronic riffs to give it a contemporary feel [51] Heartstopper marks her first project after graduating from the National Film and Television School She read the webcomic prior to composing and was given direction to have her music complement the pre-existing songs used [52] She would play chords on her keyboard, then add riffs on a synthesiser, then add sound effects [53] Some of the tracks, including the titular one, aided the \"Heartstopper moments\" by further emphasizing the feeling of electricity and excitement [52] Variations of Nick and Charlie's \"First Sight\" music were used whenever a character meets someone for the first time Ben's theme, \"X\", incorporates slapping sounds to mirror \"how his attitude slaps you in the face.\" For Season 2, Chase rearranged some previous tracks and made new ones In the finale featuring Tara and Darcy, she recorded her singing to represent comfort [53]\n\n\nRelease\nHeartstopper's one-minute teaser was released

Heartstopper which later expanded to a graphic novel after gaining a cult following [5] Sometime in 2019, See-Saw Films asked Oseman if she could try writing a screenplay [6] The production company had been suggested [7] by its own executive producer Patrick Walters, [8] who helped with Oseman's Kickstarter campaign in 2018 [7] She expressed interest in doing it, noting the lack of wholesome, teenage LGBT representation on television, hoping that this could potentially assure LGBT youth \"that they can find happiness and find romance and find friendship\" She wrote a screenplay based on the first two volumes of the graphic novel See-Saw Films liked it [6] and optioned the television rights later that July [9]\n\n\nWriting and pre-production\nIn September 2016, Alice Oseman started a

wanted actual young people to portray the characters [6] Daniel Edwards served as casting director An open casting call went out in January and February 2021 for five of the main characters and three of the recurring cast [14] Oseman explained that the character Aled Last would not appear in the adaptation to respect his story in another novel within the Heartstopper universe, Radio Silence After over 10,000 people auditioned via Zoom, she announced the first round of casting decisions in April 2021, with Kit Connor and Joe Locke starring as Nick and Charlie respectively [6] [15] Heartstopper marked Locke's acting debut [16] After agreeing that Locke suited Charlie's role, Connor was auditioned and the production team found chemistry between the two; [10] the actors themselves recalled only taking a few hours to bond [16]\n\n\nFilming\nFilming for series one began on location throughout England in April 2021 and finished that June [28] It mostly took place in Berkshire and Buckinghamshire [29] Harry's party was filmed at the Hampton Court House in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames [30] The rugby match shown in the episode \"Secret\" was filmed at the Thames Valley Athletics Centre A Hollywood Bowl bowling alley in High Wycombe was used for filming The railway station from which Nick and Charlie depart to the seaside is North Weald railway station in Essex, and the scene on the seaside was filmed in Herne Bay, Kent After milkshakes, Charlie and his friends are seen walking along the River Thames in Windsor, Berkshire, before their concert [31] Colman filmed all her scenes in two days [32] In the episode \"Boyfriend\", during a scene where Nick and Charlie take a train, Oseman decided to give herself a cameo as a passenger; she is drawing the couple nearby [33] The scene near the end of the episode featuring a merry-go-round was filled with crew members [34]\n\n\nSeason 1\nAll music is composed by Adiescar Chase, except where

animated leaves float around during moments of love, a direct copy of the visual motifs in the webcomic In Nick and Charlie's first kissing scene, sparks of electricity come out as Charlie tries touching Nick's hand Animated seagulls and lovebirds are also seen Oseman said that the animations represent a \"feeling of magic\" they intended to evoke She had already thought of using such effects while writing the screenplay, conceiving that they would appear primarily during the intimate scenes between Nick and Charlie, which she dubbed \"Heartstopper moments\" Eventually, Anna Peronetto was chosen to create the animations, using a storyboard by Oseman Peronetto had been a fan of the original source material and was chosen when Oseman made an Instagram post looking for traditional animators She discussed with Lyn and editor Sofie Alonzi to see what kinds of animations fit in a certain scene For the lovebirds, she analysed London feral parakeets [30] [48] [49]\n\n\nMusic\nAdiescar Chase composed the original score and employed electronic riffs to give it a contemporary feel [51] Heartstopper marks her first project after graduating from the National Film and Television School She read the webcomic prior to composing and was given direction to have her music complement the pre-existing songs used [52] She would play chords on her keyboard, then add riffs on a synthesiser, then add sound effects [53] Some of the tracks, including the titular one, aided the \"Heartstopper moments\" by further emphasizing the feeling of electricity and excitement [52] Variations of Nick and Charlie's \"First Sight\" music were used whenever a character meets someone for the first time Ben's theme, \"X\", incorporates slapping sounds to mirror \"how his attitude slaps you in the face.\" For Season 2, Chase rearranged some previous tracks and made new ones In the finale featuring Tara and Darcy, she recorded her singing to represent comfort [53]\n\n\nRelease\nHeartstopper's one-minute teaser was released on 16 March 2022 [54] Collider then announced that its tagline was: \"Boy meets boy Boys become friends Boys fall in love.\" Hilary Remley, who wrote the news, saw the teaser as teasing the series's \"emotionally vulnerable\" air, \"showing the experience of teenage love in a direct and sincere way\", assured that audiences will enjoy the final product due to its faithfulness to the source material's dreamlike aesthetic [55] The series's episode titles were released on 19 April, [56] before the series's episodes were released

a section that encourages women to trust their intuition and not ignore the subconscious red flags that arise in their day-to-day interactions with men He sat down to write a single thirty-page scene that would incorporate as many of these red flags as possible Cregger settled on a woman showing up to an Airbnb late at night, only to find that it had been double booked, as the ideal set-up for this exercise He stuck to the rule that if he was surprising himself with his writing, then he has to be surprising his audience \"As long as I have no long plan, then no one could know what's

flags that arise in their day-to-day interactions with men He sat down to write a single thirty-page scene that would incorporate as many of these red flags as possible Cregger settled on a woman

he has to be surprising his audience \"As long as I have no long plan, then no one could know what's coming.\" [7]\n\n\nThemes and interpretations\nBarbarian has been characterized as having themes related to sexual abuse and trauma, and, owing to the book by which Cregger was inspired, themes of different forms of misogyny Writing for Film School Rejects, Aurora Amidon asserted that the film is essentially about \"the ripple effects of abuse\", concerning the characters of AJ and Frank—who, in the habit of harming women for their own pleasure,  are cut from the same cloth [15]\n\n\nRelease\nBarbarian was originally scheduled to be theatrically released in the United States by 20th Century Studios on August 12, 2022, before being rescheduled to be released on August 31, and later September 9 [16] [17] Disney reportedly maintained a theatrical release for Barbarian (as opposed to a streaming release on Hulu) due to strong, positive reception from studio test screenings [18] [3]\n\n\nMarketing\nThe first trailer for Barbarian was released on June 23, 2022, and appeared at the front of theatrical showings of The Black Phone [17] [25] According to Margules,

Canada, and $4.5 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $45.4 million, against a production budget of $4.5 million [4] [5]\n\n\nBox office\nBarbarian grossed $40.8 million in the United States and Canada, and $4.5 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $45.4 million, against a production budget of $4.5 million [4] [5]\n\n\nStreaming viewership\nAccording to the streaming aggregator Reelgood, Barbarian was the fifth-most-watched program across all platforms during the week of October 26, 2022 [28] [29] According to Whip Media, Barbarian was the most streamed film across all platforms in the United States during the week ending October 30, [30] and the sixth during the week ending November 13 [31] According to the streaming aggregator JustWatch, Barbarian was the second most streamed film across all platforms in the United States during the week of October 31 to November 6, 2022 [32]\n\n\nCritical response\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 93% of 207 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.5/10 The website's consensus reads: \"Smart, darkly humorous and above all scary, Barbarian offers a chilling and consistently unpredictable thrill ride for horror fans.\" [33] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 78 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews [34] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"C+\" on an A+ to F scale, while those at PostTrak gave the film a 70% overall positive score, with 54% saying they would definitely recommend it [18]\n\n\nAccolades\nThe film is one of the pieces of media that received the ReFrame Stamp for the years 2022 to 2023 The stamp is awarded by the gender equity coalition ReFrame and industry database IMDbPro for film and television projects that are proven to have gender-balanced hiring, with stamps being awarded to projects that hire female-identifying people, especially women of color, in four out of eight key roles for their production [35] [36]\n\n\nVideo game adaptation\nIn October 2023, it was announced the film would receive

Brixton, London and fought at Miguel's Boxing Gym [15] [16] He had spoken of the influence boxing has had upon his early life, by stating: \"I didn't do too well at school, to be honest, but boxing saved me and changed my life And it was going well, because I knew it was my best chance in life.\" [16]\n\n\nProfessional kickboxing career\nOriginally, Whyte was a professional kickboxer, [17] to which he became two-time British heavyweight champion by claiming the BIKMA super-heavyweight title, [1] [10] [16] and one-time European K1 champion, [1] [18] while being ranked UK #1 for five years in his weight category of 95 kg+, [1] ending his kickboxing career with a K-1 record of 20–1, before then turning to MMA [19]\n\n\nHighlights\nWhyte made his professional MMA debut on 6 December 2008,

bout, in 2009, aged 20, Whyte beat Anthony Joshua by unanimous decision over three rounds [25] [26] [27] [28] He had stated prior to the fight that his trainer Chris Okoh admitted that the decision to

English title [36] [42] The UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) organisation confirmed that Whyte was provisionally suspended from all competition from 5 November 2012 [36] An independent National Anti-Doping Panel (NADP) found that the case warranted a two-year ban [36] However, Whyte appealed the ban, though the appeal panel retorted by emphasising the confirmed two-year ban; the tribunal had accepted Whyte's claim that he did not knowingly take MHA, but rejected his appeal because he did not do enough to check the supplement's ingredients, as Charles Flint QC, the chairman of the appeal tribunal, explained in his written verdict [43]\n\n\nReturn to the ring\nWhyte was cleared to compete from 12 October 2014, [36] since his two-year ban by UKAD and returned to boxing on 21 November 2014 at the

the undercard of Ricky Burns vs Kiryl Relikh on 7 October [73] Whyte and Lewison had to be separated at the weigh-in press conference Both fighters promised KOs [74] Whyte defeated Lewison to claim the vacant title via tenth-round stoppage victory The fight was stopped in round ten by Lewison's corner It appeared that he had a nose problem that caused the fight to be halted Although Lewison looked good from the opening bell, Whyte started taking control from round three onwards In round ten, Lewison turned his back to started blowing his nose Whyte missed with a big right hand From there

the undercard off Anthony Joshua vs Éric Molina for the IBF heavyweight title [76] The fight was slated to be Whyte's first defence of the British heavyweight title he won against Lewison However, at the final press conference on 7 December, following Whyte's comment that he'd attack Chisora anytime he sees him after the fight, Chisora picked up the table he was sitting at and threw it towards Whyte, just missing everyone in the way which included the promoters and trainers [77] As a result, the British Boxing Board of Control withdrew their sanction of the fight and the British title would not be at stake [78] Whyte's WBC International title was at stake instead In a contest in which both fighters were hurt, with Chisora and Whyte showing a lot of heart, Whyte won via split decision

Jennings, Mariusz Wach, Artur Szpilka and Gerald Washington as potential opponents [81] On 14 April, Washington put his name forward wanting to get back into the world title mix following his failed attempt to dethrone WBC heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder in February 2017 [82] On 19 April, Matchroom Boxing revealed Whyte's opponent would be 37 year old former world title challenger Mariusz Wach (33–2, 17 KOs) The fight was to take place live on Sky Sports and would also feature younger talents including Reece Bellotti, Ted Cheeseman and Lawrence Okolie [83] [84] The fight was postponed on 16 May due to Whyte injuring his foot There was no immediate mention as to when the fight would be rescheduled for [85]\n\n\nWhyte vs. Helenius\nEddie Hearn announced that Whyte would fight on the Anthony Joshua vs Carlos Takam (originally Kubrat Pulev) card on 28 October at the Principality Stadium in Cardiff Robert Helenius and Lucas Browne were two names mentioned On 14 September, seven weeks before the fight, Ricky Hatton stated Browne wouldn't take up the fight due to being short notice [92] [93] Some reported suggested Whyte would fight former two-time European champion Robert Helenius (25–1, 16 KOs) [94] After Luis Ortiz failed a drug test, leaving Deontay Wilder without an opponent, Whyte offered to take his place The world title fight was ultimately given to mandatory challenger Bermane Stiverne for 4 November Jarrell Miller was also considered an option before he booked himself a fight with Mariusz Wach in New York On 4 October Hearn revealed he was interested in getting Dominic Breazeale to fight Whyte, where the winner could potentially fight the winner of the Wilder vs Stiverne rematch [95] A couple of days later, Breazeale accepted the challenge [96] The talks eventually broke down On 15 October, Hearn announced Whyte vs Helenius [97] Whyte failed to impress as he defeated Helenius over twelve rounds via UD The scorecards read 119–109 twice, and 118–110 all in favour of Whyte Helenius started the fight well hurting Whyte in the second round Whyte bounced back and dominated the remainder of the fight with Helenius reluctant to throw anything meaningful to win the rounds With the win, Whyte claimed the vacant WBC Silver heavyweight title, moving him a step closer to fighting world champion Wilder [98] [99]\n\n\nWhyte vs. Browne\nOn 11 January 2018, a fight between Whyte and Lucas Browne (25–0, 22 KOs) was finally made, to take place at The O2 Arena in London on 24 March Whyte's WBC Silver title would be at stake Speaking of the fight, Whyte said, \"I can't wait, I hate Lucas Browne and I want to hurt him He's said some nasty things and he's going to have to pay for them.\" [100] [101] Whyte hit Browne with a hard left hook to the head in the round six to knock him unconscious, winning the fight There was no count made and the fight was waved off immediately with ringside doctors attending to Browne before giving him oxygen The fight was officially stopped at 37 seconds of the round Browne's face was cut and badly swollen from the clean shots landed from Whyte Browne left himself open most of the time and tried switching stances after a few rounds Browne suffered a cut over his left eye in round three, which got worse with each round Whyte then bloodied Browne's nose in round five [102] After the fight, Browne was stretchered from the ring and taken to a nearby hospital for precaution In the post-fight interview, Whyte called out WBC champion Deontay Wilder for a fight in June 2018 Promoter Eddie Hearn said, \"I hope the WBC make Dillian mandatory now, the fight is there for Deontay Wilder in June We have to force the shot and after that performance, he deserves the shot.\" Hearn stated there could be a possibility that the WBC order a final eliminator between Whyte and Dominic Breazeale [103] [104]\n\n\nWhyte vs. Parker\nOn 24 April, the WBC ordered Whyte vs Luis Ortiz in an eliminator bout for their heavyweight champion, Deontay Wilder [105] Whyte felt 'betrayed' by this decision from the WBC as he thought he was already in line to challenge Wilder next The WBC made Dominic Breazeale the mandatory challenger, although they previously confirmed his win over Eric Molina was not a final eliminator Whyte stated, if anything, the WBC should order Whyte vs Breazeale as the final eliminator Promoter Eddie Hearn was also puzzled by the decision [106] [107] [108] At the same time, the IBF also ordered Whyte to fight former world title challenger Kubrat Pulev (25–1, 13 KO) A purse bid was set for 10 May [109] The purse bids were delayed as a deal between Hearn and Team Sauerland, Pulev's promoter, was close to being agreed The IBF gave them until 24 May [110] Despite Whyte stating that Pulev did not want the fight, Pulev stated he was more than happy to fight Whyte, but \"a lot of things need to be agreed\" before the fight could be confirmed According to Nisse Sauerland, the date of 28 July was being discussed with the host venue being either London or Bulgaria [111] [112] New York based promotional company, Epic Sports & Entertainment, made a purse bid of $1,500,111, winning the rights of the fight Eddie Hearn offered $831,111, which was higher than the $801,305 bid from Team Sauerland IBF rules state, for a final eliminator, the higher ranked boxer, in this case Pulev, would get 75% ($1,125,083.25) and Whyte would earn $375,027.75 for the fight [113] [114] On 6 June, although the Whyte vs Pulev fight was not off the table, it was heavily rumoured via multiple sources that Whyte would instead fight Luis Ortiz in a WBC final eliminator Many media outlets announced the fight [115] Pulev was unhappy with the pull out and labelled Whyte and Hearn as \"extreme manipulators and plain schizophrenics\" as well as accusing them of avoiding him at all costs [116]\n\n\nWhyte vs. Chisora II\nIn mid October 2018, Whyte and Luis Ortiz appeared to have a war of words and called each other out, with Ortiz stating he would come to the UK and fight Whyte on 22 December, a potential PPV date allocated to the possible Whyte vs Chisora rematch After hearing this, Chisora came out saying 'No one wants to see that  [Whyte-Ortiz]', that he was 'the Money Man' and Whyte should fight him if he wants to earn more money [137] Hearn also stated despite Ortiz putting his name forward, Chisora was the front-runner to fight Whyte [138]\n\n\nFirst reign as WBC interim heavyweight champion\nFollowing his eleventh-round knockout victory over Chisora, Whyte called out unified heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua Joshua, who was unusually booed by many of those present at the O2 Arena, said: \"If Deontay Wilder is serious and he is going to fight Tyson Fury and doesn't want to become undisputed champion, Dillian, you will get a title shot.\" On 12 January 2019, Whyte revealed that he had turned down a \"severe lowball\" offer from Joshua to fight him in a rematch Whyte did not reveal the figure, however, he claimed it was lower than what he received against Chisora in December 2018 Whyte claimed the Joshua fight \"was dead\" and he was to look at other options, including a potential fight with Dominic Breazeale for the WBC interim title, but Breazeale challenged Deontay Wilder for the world title WBC-NABF, IBF International, and WBO-NABO champion Óscar Rivas, had enhanced his reputation as a danger man following his brutal KO of the former world title challenger Bryant Jennings in January.\n\n\nWhyte vs. Rivas\nFollowing his

rescheduled for 22 August at the Matchroom Sport headquarters in Brentwood, Essex Prior to the rescheduled fight, Whyte split with long-time coach Mark Tibbs He promoted Xavier Miller from his team to head coach [146] Povetkin was ranked #6 by The Ring and #9 by the WBC at heavyweight [147] Whyte lost the fight via knockout in the fifth round, losing his WBC interim title and mandatory position for Tyson Fury's WBC title He had started off well and controlled the fight in the first four rounds, knocking Povetkin down twice in the fourth round However, just 30 seconds into the following round, Povetkin landed an uppercut which left Whyte flat on his back, prompting the referee to call an immediate halt to the contest [148]\n\n\nSecond reign as WBC interim heavyweight champion\nAn immediate rematch with Alexander Povetkin was scheduled for 21 November 2020, but was pushed back to 27 March 2021 when Povetkin tested positive for COVID-19 [149] [150] With fans in attendance, the fight took

(NADP) found that the case warranted a two-year ban [36] However, Whyte appealed the ban, though the appeal panel retorted by emphasising the confirmed two-year ban; the tribunal had accepted Whyte's claim that he did not knowingly take MHA, but rejected his appeal because he did not do enough to check the supplement's ingredients, as Charles Flint QC, the chairman of the appeal tribunal, explained in his written verdict [43]\n\n\nReturn to the ring\nWhyte was cleared to compete from 12 October 2014, [36] since his two-year ban by UKAD and returned to boxing on 21 November 2014 at the

challenger Bermane Stiverne for 4 November Jarrell Miller was also considered an option before he booked himself a fight with Mariusz Wach in New York On 4 October Hearn revealed he was interested in getting Dominic Breazeale to fight Whyte, where the winner could potentially fight the winner of the Wilder vs Stiverne rematch [95] A couple of days later, Breazeale accepted the challenge [96] The

meaningful to win the rounds With the win, Whyte claimed the vacant WBC Silver heavyweight title, moving him a step closer to fighting world champion Wilder [98] [99]\n\n\nWhyte vs. Browne\nOn 11 January 2018, a fight between Whyte and Lucas Browne (25–0, 22 KOs) was finally made, to take place at The O2 Arena in London on 24 March Whyte's WBC Silver title would be at stake Speaking of the fight, Whyte said, \"I can't wait, I hate Lucas Browne and I want to hurt him He's said some nasty things and he's going to have to pay for them.\" [100] [101] Whyte hit Browne with a hard left hook to the head in the round six to knock him unconscious, winning the fight There was no count made and the fight was waved off immediately with ringside doctors attending to Browne before giving him

Hearn said, \"I hope the WBC make Dillian mandatory now, the fight is there for Deontay Wilder in June We have to force the shot and after that performance, he deserves the shot.\" Hearn stated there could be a possibility that the WBC order a final eliminator between Whyte and Dominic Breazeale [103] [104]\n\n\nWhyte vs. Parker\nOn 24 April, the WBC ordered Whyte vs Luis Ortiz in an eliminator bout for their heavyweight champion, Deontay Wilder [105] Whyte felt 'betrayed' by this decision from the WBC as he thought he was already in line to challenge Wilder next The WBC made Dominic Breazeale the mandatory challenger, although they previously confirmed his win over Eric Molina was not a final eliminator Whyte stated, if anything, the WBC should order Whyte vs Breazeale as the final eliminator Promoter Eddie Hearn was also puzzled by the decision [106] [107] [108] At the same time, the IBF also ordered Whyte to fight former world title challenger Kubrat Pulev (25–1, 13 KO) A purse bid was set for 10 May [109] The purse bids were delayed as a deal between Hearn and Team Sauerland, Pulev's promoter, was close to being agreed The IBF gave them until 24 May [110] Despite

Sauerland, the date of 28 July was being discussed with the host venue being either London or Bulgaria [111] [112] New York based promotional company, Epic Sports & Entertainment, made a purse bid of $1,500,111, winning the rights of the fight Eddie Hearn offered $831,111, which was higher than the $801,305 bid from Team Sauerland IBF rules state, for a final eliminator, the higher ranked boxer, in this case Pulev, would get 75% ($1,125,083.25) and Whyte would earn $375,027.75 for the fight [113] [114] On 6 June, although the Whyte vs Pulev fight was not off the table, it was heavily rumoured via multiple sources that Whyte would instead fight Luis Ortiz in a WBC final eliminator Many media outlets announced the fight [115] Pulev was unhappy with the pull out and labelled Whyte and Hearn as \"extreme manipulators and plain schizophrenics\" as well as accusing them of avoiding him at all costs [116]\n\n\nWhyte vs. Chisora II\nIn mid October 2018, Whyte and Luis Ortiz appeared to have a war of words and called each other out, with Ortiz stating he would come to the UK and fight Whyte on 22 December, a potential PPV date allocated to the possible Whyte vs Chisora rematch After hearing this, Chisora came out saying 'No one wants to see that  [Whyte-Ortiz]', that he was 'the Money Man' and Whyte should fight him if he wants to earn more money [137] Hearn also stated despite Ortiz putting his name forward, Chisora was the front-runner to fight Whyte [138]\n\n\nFirst reign as WBC interim heavyweight champion\nFollowing his eleventh-round knockout victory over Chisora, Whyte called out unified heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua Joshua, who was unusually booed by many of those present at the O2 Arena, said: \"If Deontay Wilder is serious and he is going to fight Tyson Fury and doesn't want to become undisputed champion, Dillian, you will get a title shot.\" On 12 January 2019, Whyte revealed that he had turned down a \"severe lowball\" offer from Joshua to fight him in a rematch Whyte did not reveal the figure, however, he claimed it was lower than what he received against Chisora in December 2018 Whyte claimed the Joshua fight \"was dead\" and he was to look at other options, including a potential fight with Dominic Breazeale for the WBC interim title, but Breazeale challenged Deontay Wilder for the world title WBC-NABF, IBF International, and WBO-NABO

Fury, who himself had previously fought and defeated Wallin in September 2019 [154]\n\n\nPost-title career\nThe bout was held at the Wembley Arena, London, England, on 26 November 2022 and Whyte won

August, in a rematch of their bout in 2015, which resulted in Joshua getting the win On 5 August 2023, it was announced that Whyte had received a positive drug test and later it was announced that he would be replaced by Robert Helenius in the fight [168] [169] An investigation later found the positive drug test to be a result of a contaminated supplement and Whyte was cleared to resume his boxing career [170]\n\n\nWhyte vs. Hammer\nAfter 16 months of inactivity, Whyte faced Christian Hammer at the TF Royal Theatre in Castlebar, Ireland on 17 March 2024, Saint Patrick's Day [171] [172] Hammer

extensive portfolio of songwriters, many in need of work after the British Invasion had reorganized the American music scene; while several Aldon writers contributed songs to the Monkees during their existence, the bulk of the songwriting for the group fell upon Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart, two songwriters who were only beginning to break through to success at the time [15] Boyce and Hart contributed four demo recordings for the pilot [16] One of these recordings was \"(Theme From) The Monkees\" which helped get the series the green light [17]\n\n\nDeveloping the music for their debut

recordings for the pilot [16] One of these recordings was \"(Theme From) The Monkees\" which helped get the series the green light [17]\n\n\nLineup configuration\nIn assigning instruments for purposes of the television show, a dilemma arose as to which of the four would portray the drummer Both Nesmith (a skilled guitarist and bassist) and Tork (who could play several stringed and keyboard instruments) were peripherally familiar with the instrument, but both declined to give the drum set a try Jones knew how to play the drums and tested well enough on the instrument; however, the producers believed that he would be virtually hidden from view behind a drum set due to his short stature Thus, Dolenz (who knew only how to play the guitar) was assigned to become the drummer Tork taught Dolenz his first few beats on the drums, enough for him to fake his way through filming the pilot He was soon taught how to play properly [27] The lineup for the TV show most frequently featured Nesmith on guitar, Tork on bass, Dolenz on drums and Jones as a frontman, singer and percussionist, despite the fact that this lineup did not correspond to the members' musical strengths Tork was a more experienced guitar player than Nesmith, while Nesmith had trained on the bass Also, while Jones had a strong lead voice and did sing lead on several Monkees recordings, Dolenz's voice is regarded, particularly by Nesmith, as distinctive and a hallmark of the Monkees' sound [28] [better source needed]\n\n\nLive performances and touring\nPleased with their initial efforts, Columbia (over Kirshner's objections) planned to send the Monkees out to play live concerts The massive success of the series—and its spin-off records—created intense pressure to mount a touring version of the group Against the initial wishes of the producers, the band went out on the road and made their debut live performance in December 1966 in Hawaii [30]\n\n\nIndependence\nIn early 1967, controversy concerning the Monkees' studio abilities arose Dolenz told a reporter that the Wrecking Crew provided the backing tracks for the first two Monkees albums, and that his position as drummer was simply because a Monkee had to learn to play the drums, and he only knew the guitar [32] In the January 28, 1967, issue of Saturday Evening Post an article quoted Nesmith railing against the music creation process \"Do you know how debilitating it is to sit up and have to duplicate somebody else's records?\" he asked \"Tell the world we don't record our own music.\" [33]\n\n\nConflict with Kirshner\nIn

[33]\n\n\nHeadquarters and Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn & Jones Ltd.\nWith Kirshner dismissed as musical supervisor, in late February 1967 Nesmith hired former Turtles bassist Douglas Farthing Hatlelid, who was better known by his stage name Chip Douglas, to produce the next Monkees album [38] This album was to be the first Monkees album where they were the only musicians, outside of most of the bass and the horns Douglas was responsible for both music presentation—actually leading the band and engineering recordings—and playing bass on most of Headquarters This album, along with their next, Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn & Jones Ltd., served as the soundtrack to the second season of the television show.\n\n\nThe Birds, The Bees & The Monkees\nNo longer desiring to work as a group, the Monkees dropped Chip Douglas as a producer, and starting in November 1967, they largely produced their own sessions [53] Although credited to the whole band, the songs were mostly solo efforts [57] In a couple of cases, Boyce and Hart had returned from the first two albums to produce, but credit was given to the Monkees due to contractual requirements [58]\n\n\nBeyond television and Head\nAs the second season of the television series was being produced, the Monkees tired of the sitcom format and refused to participate in a third season without a major overhaul NBC was uninterested in making any changes, and so the series was cancelled in February 1968.\n\n\nLater years and separation\nTensions within the group were increasing Peter Tork, citing exhaustion, quit the band by buying out the last four years of his Monkees contract at $150,000 per year, equal to about $1,250,000 per year today [when?] Tork departed shortly after the band's September–October Far East tour in December 1968 and after the band completed work on their 1969 NBC television special, 33⅓ Revolutions Per Monkee (which rehashed many of the ideas from Head, only with the Monkees playing a strangely second-string role) In the DVD commentary for the television special, Dolenz noted that after filming was complete, Nesmith gave Tork a gold watch as a going-away present, engraved \"From the guys down at work.\" Most of the songs from the 33 1/3 Revolutions Per Monkee TV Special were not officially released until over 40 years later, on the 2010 and 2011 Rhino Handmade Deluxe boxed sets of Head and Instant Replay.\n\n\nTork's resignation, Instant Replay and The Monkees Present\nTensions within the group were increasing Peter Tork, citing exhaustion, quit the band by buying out the last four years of his

Replay.\n\n\nNesmith's resignation, Changes and disbandment\nOn April 14, 1970, Nesmith joined Dolenz and Jones for the last time as part of the original incarnation of the Monkees to film a Kool-Aid commercial (with the then-newly introduced Nerf balls, thrown around a mock living room by the trio, available as a premium for Kool-Aid labels), [79] with Nesmith leaving the group to continue recording songs with his own country-rock group called Michael Nesmith & the First National Band, which he had started recording with on February 10, 1970 [80]\n\n\nReunions and revivals\nWith repeats of the television series The Monkees airing on Saturday mornings and in syndication, the group once again appeared on the charts in 1976 with The Monkees Greatest Hits The LP, issued by Arista Records (who by this time had possession of the Monkees' master tapes courtesy of their corporate owner, Screen Gems), was actually a re-packaging of an earlier (1972) compilation LP called Refocus that had been issued by Arista's previous label imprint, Bell Records Dolenz and Jones took advantage of this, joining ex-Monkees songwriters Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart to tour the United States From 1975 to 1977, as the \"Golden Hits of the Monkees\" show (\"The Guys who Wrote 'Em and the Guys who Sang 'Em!\"), they successfully performed in smaller venues such as state fairs and amusement parks The tour also made stops in Japan, Thailand, Hong Kong and Singapore An album of new material was released under the name Dolenz, Jones, Boyce & Hart Nesmith had not been interested in a reunion, and Tork could not be located in time to be invited [citation needed]\n\n\nDolenz, Jones, Boyce & Hart\nWith repeats of the television series The Monkees airing on Saturday mornings and in syndication, the

Nickelodeon reignite Monkeemania\nBrushed off by critics during their heyday in the late 1960s as manufactured and lacking talent, the Monkees experienced a critical and commercial renaissance two decades later A Monkees TV show marathon (\"Pleasant Valley Sunday\") was broadcast on February 23, 1986, on MTV Nickelodeon began to run the Monkees' old television series daily Such promotion helped to resurrect a smaller version of Monkeemania, leading to tour dates that grew from smaller to larger venues and became one of the biggest live acts of 1986 and 1987.\n\n\nNew Monkees\nIn 1987, a new television series called New Monkees appeared Other than centering on a boy band quartet, it bore no resemblance to the earlier series or group The New Monkees left the air after 13 episodes.\n\n\n1990s reunions\nIn the 1990s, the Monkees continued to record new material The band also re-issued all its original LPs on CD Most of them included between three and six bonus tracks of previously unreleased songs or alternate takes; the first editions came with collectable trading cards.\n\n\n2000s reunions\nAfter the 1997 tours, the group took another hiatus until they once again reunited in 2001 to tour the United States However, this tour was also accompanied by public sniping Dolenz and Jones had announced that they had \"fired\" Tork for his constant complaining and threatening to quit Tork was quoted as confirming this, as well as stating that he wanted to tour with his own band, Shoe Suede Blues Tork told WENN News that he \"couldn't handle the backstage problems\"; he added that because he was a recovering alcoholic, he was troubled by the overindulgence in alcohol by other members of the tour crew [90] Tork later stated in 2011 that alcohol played only a small role in his 2001 departure He added, \"I take full responsibility for the backstage problems on the 2001 tour We were getting along pretty well until I had a meltdown I ticked the other guys off good and proper.. I really just behaved inappropriately, honestly I apologized to them.\" [91]\n\n\n45th anniversary tour and Jones's death\nAn Evening with The Monkees: The 45th Anniversary Tour (without Nesmith) commenced on May 12, 2011, in Liverpool, England, [92] before moving to North America in June and July for a total of 43 performances [93] Monkees biographer Andrew Sandoval noted, \"Once they hit the stage, the old magic was apparent For the next three months.. [they brought] the music and memories to fans in the band's grandest stage show in decades\" [14] The tour grossed approximately $4 million [94]\n\n\nReunion with Nesmith\nOn August 8, 2012, the surviving trio announced a series of U.S shows for November and December, commencing in Escondido, California and concluding in New York City The brief tour marked the first time Nesmith performed with the Monkees since 1997 [100] Jones's memory was honored throughout the shows via recordings and video During one point, the band went quiet and a recording of Jones singing \"I Wanna Be Free\" played while footage of him was screening behind the band For Jones's signature song, \"Daydream Believer\", Dolenz said that the band had discussed who should sing the song and had concluded that it should be the fans, saying \"It doesn't belong to us anymore It belongs to you.\" [101]\n\n\nGood Times! and 50th anniversary\nDolenz and Tork toured as the Monkees in 2015 without Nesmith's participation Nesmith stated that he was busy with other ventures, although Dolenz said that he was welcome to join them [104]\n\n\nThe Mike and Micky Show, Christmas Party, and Tork's death\nOn February 20, 2018, a new tour was announced as \"The Monkees Present: The Mike and Micky Show\", their first tour as a duo; Tork was unable to participate due to health problems (a fact that was not revealed until after his death) Though the pair played Monkees music and promoted the tour under the Monkees banner, Dolenz and Nesmith respected Tork's absence by insisting that the shows be billed as a separate duo rather than being billed as official Monkees shows Nesmith stated, \"There's no pretense there about Micky and I being the Monkees We're not.\" [108]\n\n\nFarewell tour and Nesmith's death\nFollowing the success of the Mike and Micky Show, Dolenz and Nesmith announced a follow-up tour, An Evening with the Monkees, to begin in early 2020 [113] The tour was delayed, however, due the COVID-19 pandemic It was announced on May 4, 2021, that the rescheduled dates would be billed as a farewell tour \"The Monkees Farewell Tour\" consisted of over 40 dates in the US from September to November; because of restrictions due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, they were unable to play shows in Canada, the UK or Australia The final date and final show for the Monkees Farewell Tour was held on November 14, 2021, at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles [114] [115]\n\n\nMicky Dolenz\nIn early 2022, Dolenz announced that he would embark on a \"special series of concert dates in April 2022 Honoring the contributions of his bandmates – the late Davy Jones, Mike Nesmith & Peter Tork – in song and with personal multimedia footage of the legendary performers\" Monkees manager and tour manager Andrew Sandoval stated that \"We will be fully delving into The Monkees' songbook, as well as Micky's personal archive of films and photos to create a unique evening of memories...\" [119] The official tour was set to start on April 5, 2022, with a pre-tour performance on \"The Beach Boys Good Vibrations Cruise\" [120]\n\n\n\"The Monkees Celebrated by Micky Dolenz\" tour\nIn early 2022, Dolenz announced that he would embark on a \"special series of concert dates in April 2022 Honoring the contributions of his bandmates – the late Davy Jones, Mike Nesmith & Peter Tork – in song and with personal multimedia footage of the legendary performers\" Monkees manager and tour manager Andrew Sandoval stated that \"We will be fully delving into The Monkees' songbook, as well as Micky's

Vibrations Cruise\" [120]\n\n\nImpact and legacy\nThe Monkees, selected specifically to appeal to the youth market as American television's response to the Beatles [121] with their manufactured personae and carefully produced singles, are seen as an original precursor to the modern proliferation of studio and corporation-created bands But this critical reputation has softened somewhat, with the recognition that the Monkees were neither the first manufactured group nor unusual in this respect The Monkees also frequently contributed their own songwriting efforts on their albums and saw their musical skills improve They ultimately became a self-directed group, playing their own instruments and writing many of their own songs.\n\n\nIn popular culture\nThe Criterion Collection, which has a stated goal to release \"a continuing series of important classic and contemporary films,  [and] has been dedicated to gathering the greatest films from around the world and publishing them in editions that offer the highest technical quality and award-winning, original supplements\" [127] recognized the Monkees' film Head as meeting their criteria when they fully restored and released it on DVD and Blu-ray in 2010 They stated that Head was \"way, way ahead of its time\" and \"arguably the most authentically psychedelic film made in 1960s Hollywood\" [128] Head dodged commercial success on its release but has since been reclaimed as one of the great cult objects of its era.\" [129]\n\n\nComic books\nA comic book series, The Monkees, was published in the United States by Dell Comics, which ran for 17 issues from 1967 to 1969 [133]\n\n\nBiopic\nIn 2000, VH-1 produced the television biopic Daydream Believers: The Monkees' Story [134] In 2002, the movie was released on DVD and featured both commentaries and interviews with Dolenz, Jones and Tork The aired version did differ from the DVD release, as the TV version had an extended scene with all four Monkees meeting the Beatles, but with a shortened Cleveland concert segment It was also available on VHS.\n\n\nMusical\nA stage musical opened in the UK at the Manchester Opera House on Friday March 30, 2012, and was dedicated to Davy Jones (the Jones family attended the official opening on April 3) [135] The production is a Jukebox musical and starred Stephen Kirwan, Ben Evans, Tom Parsons and Oliver Savile [135] as actors playing the parts of the Monkees (respectively Dolenz, Jones, Nesmith, Tork) who are hired by an unscrupulous businessman to go on a world tour pretending to be the real band The show includes 18 Monkees songs plus numbers by other 60s artists It ran in Manchester as part of the \"Manchester Gets it First\" program until April 14, 2012, before a UK tour [135] [136] Following its Manchester run, the show appeared in the Glasgow King's Theatre and the Sunderland Empire Theatre [135]\n\n\nAwards and achievements\nThe Grammy Awards is an accolade by the National Academy of

The group was created for a television show of the same name, which aired from 1966 to 1968. The show was a mockumentary-style sitcom that followed the lives of four young musicians as they navigated the music industry.\n\nConception and Casting\n---------------------\n\nThe Monkees were formed in the mid-1960s in Los Angeles. Don Kirshner, Screen Gems' head of music, was contacted to secure music for The Monkees pilot.

While several Aldon writers contributed songs to the Monkees during their existence, the bulk of the songwriting for the group fell upon Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart, two songwriters who were only beginning to break through to success at the time. Boyce and Hart contributed four demo recordings for the pilot. One of these recordings was \"(Theme From) The Monkees\" which helped get the series the green light.\n\nEarly Years\n------------\n\nDuring the casting process, the producers were searching for four young men who could play the roles of the Monkees on the television show. The four members of the group were chosen from a pool of over 400 hopefuls. The members of the Monkees were:\n\n* Davy Jones (born December 30, 1945)\n* Mickey Dolenz (born March 8, 1945)\n* Michael Nesmith (born December 30, 1942)\n* Peter Tork (born February 13, 1942)\n\nThe Monkees' original lineup was formed in 1965, with Jones, Dolenz, Nesmith, and Tork joining the group. They were initially called \"The Hardy Boys\" but later changed their name to the Monkees.\n\nDeveloping the Music for Their Debut Album\n----------------------------------------\n\nAfter the group was formed, they began working on their debut album. The producers of the show wanted the Monkees to have a distinct sound, so they enlisted the help of several songwriters, including Boyce and Hart. The Monkees' debut album, \"The Monkees,\" was released in 1966 and featured a mix of folk rock, pop, and rockabilly. The album was a commercial success, and the Monkees quickly became one of the most popular bands of the 1960s.\n\nLineup Configuration\n-------------------\n\nIn assigning instruments for purposes of the television show, a dilemma arose as to which of the four would portray the drummer.

This album, along with their next, Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn & Jones Ltd., served as the soundtrack to the second season of the television show.\n\nThe Birds, The Bees & The Monkees\n---------------------------------\n\nNo longer desiring to work as a group, the Monkees dropped Chip Douglas as a producer, and starting in November 1967, they largely produced their own sessions. Although credited to the whole band, the songs were mostly solo efforts. In a couple of cases, Boyce and Hart had returned from the first two albums to produce, but credit was given to the Monkees due to contractual requirements.\n\nBeyond Television and Head\n---------------------------\n\nAs the second season of the television series was being produced, the Monkees tired of the sitcom format and refused to participate in a third season without a major overhaul. NBC was uninterested in making any changes, and so the series was cancelled in February 1968.\n\nLater Years and Separation\n-------------------------\n\nTensions within the group were increasing. Peter Tork, citing exhaustion, quit the band by buying out the last four years of his Monkees contract at $150,000 per year, equal to about $1,250,000 per year today. Tork departed shortly after the band's September–October Far East tour in December 1968 and after the band completed work on their 1969 NBC television special, 33⅓ Revolutions Per Monkee.\n\nNesmith's Resignation, Changes and Disbandment\n---------------------------------------------\n\nOn April 14, 1970, Nesmith joined Dolenz and Jones for the last time as part of the original incarnation of the Monkees to film a Kool-Aid commercial (with the then-newly introduced Nerf balls, thrown around a mock living room by the trio, available as a premium for Kool-Aid labels). Nesmith left the group to continue recording songs with his own country-rock group called Michael Nesmith & the First National Band, which he had started recording with on February 10, 1970.\n\nReunions and Revivals\n---------------------\n\nWith repeats of the television series The Monkees airing on Saturday mornings and in syndication, the group once again appeared on the charts in 1976 with The Monkees Greatest Hits The LP, issued by Arista Records (who by this time had possession of the Monkees' master tapes courtesy of their corporate owner, Screen Gems), was actually a re-packaging of an earlier (1972) compilation LP called Refocus that had been issued by Arista's previous label imprint, Bell Records. Dolenz and Jones took advantage of this, joining ex-Monkees songwriters Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart to tour the United States From 1975 to 1977, as the \"Golden Hits of the Monkees\" show (\"The Guys who Wrote 'Em and the Guys who Sang 'Em!\"), they successfully performed in smaller venues such as state fairs and amusement parks The tour also made stops in Japan, Thailand, Hong Kong, and Singapore An album of new material was released under the name Dolenz, Jones, Boyce & Hart Nesmith had not been interested in a reunion, and Tork could not be located in time to be invited.\n\nDolenz, Jones, Boyce & Hart\n-----------------------------\n\nWith repeats of the television series The Monkees airing on Saturday mornings and in syndication, the group once again appeared on the charts in 1976 with The Monkees Greatest Hits The LP, issued by Arista Records (who by this time had possession of the Monkees' master tapes courtesy of their corporate owner, Screen Gems), was actually a re-packaging of an earlier (1972) compilation LP called Refocus that had been issued by Arista's previous label imprint, Bell Records.

I really just behaved inappropriately, honestly I apologized to them.\"\n\n45th Anniversary Tour\n----------------------\n\nAn Evening with The Monkees: The 45th Anniversary Tour (without Nesmith) commenced on May 12, 2011, in Liverpool, England, before moving to North America in June and July for a total of 43 performances Monkees biographer Andrew Sandoval noted, \"Once they hit the stage, the old magic was apparent For the next three months.. [they brought] the music and memories to fans in the band's grandest stage show in decades\" The tour grossed approximately $4 million.\n\nReunion with Nesmith\n----------------------\n\nOn August 8, 2012, the surviving trio announced a series of U.S shows for November and December, commencing in Escondido, California and concluding in New York City The brief tour marked the first time Nesmith performed with the Monkees since 1997 Jones's memory was honored throughout the shows via recordings and video During one point, the band went quiet and a recording of Jones singing \"I Wanna Be Free\" played while footage of him was screening behind the band For Jones's signature song, \"Daydream Believer\", Dolenz said that the band had discussed who should sing the song and had concluded that it should be the fans, saying \"It doesn't belong to us anymore It belongs to you.\"\n\nGood Times! and 50th Anniversary\n---------------------------------\n\nDolenz and Tork toured as the Monkees in 2015 without Nesmith's participation Nesmith stated that he was busy with other ventures, although Dolenz said that he was welcome to join them The duo completed a second leg of the tour in 2016, which also included stops in the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe Mike and Micky Show, Christmas Party, and Tork's Death\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nOn February 20, 2018, a new tour was announced as \"The Monkees Present: The Mike and Micky Show\", their first tour as a duo; Tork was unable to participate due to health problems (a fact that was not revealed until after his death) Though the pair played Monkees music and promoted the tour under the Monkees banner, Dolenz and Nesmith respected Tork's absence by insisting that the shows be billed as a separate duo rather than being billed as official Monkees shows Nesmith stated, \"There's no pretense there about Micky and I being the Monkees We're not.\"\n\nFarewell Tour and Nesmith's Death\n---------------------------------\n\nFollowing the success of the Mike and Micky Show, Dolenz and Nesmith announced a follow-up tour, An Evening with the Monkees, to begin in early 2020 The tour was delayed, however, due to the COVID-19 pandemic It was announced on May 4, 2021, that the rescheduled dates would be billed as a farewell tour \"The Monkees Farewell Tour\" consisted of over 40 dates in the US from September to November; because of restrictions due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, they were unable to play shows in Canada, the UK or Australia The final date and final show for the Monkees Farewell Tour was held on November 14, 2021, at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles.\n\nMicky Dolenz's Solo Tour\n-------------------------\n\nIn early 2022, Dolenz announced that he would embark on a \"special series of concert dates in April 2022 Honoring the contributions of his bandmates – the late Davy Jones, Mike Nesmith & Peter Tork – in song and with personal multimedia footage of the legendary performers\" Monkees manager and tour manager Andrew Sandoval stated that \"We will be fully delving into The Monkees' songbook, as well as Micky's personal archive of films and photos to create a unique evening of memories...\" The official tour was set to start on April 5, 2022, with a pre-tour performance on \"The Beach Boys Good Vibrations Cruise\".\n\nImpact and Legacy\n-------------------\n\nThe Monkees, selected specifically to appeal to the youth market as American television's response to the Beatles, with their manufactured personae and carefully produced singles, are seen as an original precursor to the modern proliferation of studio and corporation-created bands But this critical reputation has softened somewhat, with the recognition that the Monkees were neither the first manufactured group nor unusual in this respect The Monkees also frequently contributed their own songwriting efforts on their albums and saw their musical skills improve They ultimately became a self-directed group, playing their own instruments and writing many of their own songs.\n\nIn Popular Culture\n-------------------\n\nThe Criterion Collection, which has a stated goal to release \"a continuing series of important classic and contemporary films, [and] has been dedicated to gathering the greatest films from around the world and publishing them in editions that offer the highest technical quality and award-winning, original supplements\", recognized the Monkees' film Head as meeting their criteria when they fully restored and released it on DVD and Blu-ray in 2010 They stated that Head was \"way, way ahead of its time\" and \"arguably the most authentically psychedelic film made in 1960s Hollywood\" Head dodged commercial success on its release but has since been reclaimed as one of the great cult objects of its era.\n\nComic Books\n------------\n\nA comic book series, The Monkees, was published in the United States by Dell Comics, which ran for 17 issues from 1967 to 1969.\n\nBiopic\n------\n\nIn 2000, VH-1 produced the television biopic Daydream Believers: The Monkees' Story. In 2002, the movie was released on DVD and featured both commentaries and interviews with Dolenz, Jones, and Tork. The aired version did differ from the DVD release, as the TV version had an extended scene with all four Monkees meeting the Beatles, but with a shortened Cleveland concert segment. It was also available on VHS.\n\nStage Musical\n--------------\n\nA stage musical opened in the UK at the Manchester Opera House on Friday March 30, 2012, and was dedicated to Davy Jones (the Jones family attended the official opening on April 3). The production is a Jukebox musical and starred Stephen Kirwan, Ben Evans, Tom Parsons, and Oliver Savile as actors playing the parts of the Monkees (respectively Dolenz, Jones, Nesmith, Tork) who are hired by an unscrupulous businessman to go on a world tour pretending to be the real band. The show includes 18 Monkees songs, plus numbers by other 1960s artists. It ran in Manchester as part of the \"Manchester Gets it First\" program until April 14, 2012, before a UK tour. Following its Manchester run, the show appeared in the Glasgow King's Theatre and the Sunderland Empire Theatre.\n\nAwards and Achievements\n----------------------\n\nThe Monkees have been nominated for numerous awards throughout their career, including multiple Grammy Awards, American Music Awards, and Billboard Music Awards. In 2018, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nNotable Achievements\n---------------------\n\nVarious magazines and news outlets, such as Time, NPR, The Christian Science Monitor, Goldmine, Yahoo! Music, and MSNBC, have argued that the Monkees belong in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 1992, Davy Jones told People that he knew the Monkees would never make the Rock and Roll Hall", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"The_Monkees\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nThe Monkees were formed in the mid-1960s in Los Angeles [5]\n\n\nConception and casting\nThe Monkees were formed in the mid-1960s in Los Angeles [5]\n\n\nEarly years\nDuring the casting process, Don Kirshner, Screen Gems' head of music, was contacted to secure music for The Monkees pilot Kirshner's Brill Building firm Aldon Music had an extensive portfolio of songwriters, many in need of work after the British Invasion had reorganized the American music scene; while several Aldon writers contributed songs to the Monkees during their existence, the bulk of the songwriting for the group fell upon Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart, two songwriters who were only beginning to break through to success at the time [15] Boyce and Hart contributed four demo recordings for the pilot [16] One of these recordings was \"(Theme From) The Monkees\" which helped get the series the green light [17]\n\n\nDeveloping the music for their debut album\nDuring the casting process, Don Kirshner, Screen Gems' head of music, was contacted to secure music for The Monkees pilot Kirshner's Brill Building firm Aldon Music had an extensive portfolio of songwriters, many in need of work after the British Invasion had reorganized the American music scene; while several Aldon writers contributed songs to the Monkees during their existence, the bulk of the songwriting for the group fell upon Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart, two songwriters who were only beginning to break through to success at the time [15] Boyce and Hart contributed four demo recordings for the pilot [16] One of these recordings was \"(Theme From) The Monkees\" which helped get the series the green light [17]\n\n\nLineup configuration\nIn assigning instruments for purposes of the television show, a dilemma arose as to which of the four would portray the drummer Both Nesmith (a skilled guitarist and bassist) and Tork (who could play several stringed and keyboard instruments) were peripherally familiar with the instrument, but both declined to give the drum set a try Jones knew how to play the drums and tested well enough on the instrument; however, the producers believed that he would be virtually hidden from view behind a drum set due to his short stature Thus, Dolenz (who knew only how to play the guitar) was assigned to become the drummer Tork taught Dolenz his first few beats on the drums, enough for him to fake his way through filming the pilot He was soon taught how to play properly [27] The lineup for the TV show most frequently featured Nesmith on guitar, Tork on bass, Dolenz on drums and Jones as a frontman, singer and percussionist, despite the fact that this lineup did not correspond to the members' musical strengths Tork was a more experienced guitar player than Nesmith, while Nesmith had trained on the bass Also, while Jones had a strong lead voice and did sing lead on several Monkees recordings, Dolenz's voice is regarded, particularly by Nesmith, as distinctive and a hallmark of the Monkees' sound [28] [better source needed]\n\n\nLive performances and touring\nPleased with their initial efforts, Columbia (over Kirshner's objections) planned to send the Monkees out to play live concerts The massive success of the series—and its spin-off records—created intense pressure to mount a touring version of the group Against the initial wishes of the producers, the band went out on the road and made their debut live performance in December 1966 in Hawaii [30]\n\n\nIndependence\nIn early 1967, controversy concerning the Monkees' studio abilities arose Dolenz told a reporter that the Wrecking Crew provided the backing tracks for the first two Monkees albums, and that his position as drummer was simply because a Monkee had to learn to play the drums, and he only knew the guitar [32] In the January 28, 1967, issue of Saturday Evening Post an article quoted Nesmith railing against the music creation process \"Do you know how debilitating it is to sit up and have to duplicate somebody else's records?\" he asked \"Tell the world we don't record our own music.\" [33]\n\n\nConflict with Kirshner\nIn early 1967, controversy concerning the Monkees' studio

Ltd.\nWith Kirshner dismissed as musical supervisor, in late February 1967 Nesmith hired former Turtles bassist Douglas Farthing Hatlelid, who was better known by his stage name Chip Douglas, to produce the next Monkees album [38] This album was to be the first Monkees album where they were the only musicians, outside of most of the bass and the horns Douglas was responsible for both music presentation—actually leading the band and engineering recordings—and playing bass on most of Headquarters This album, along with their next, Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn & Jones Ltd., served as the soundtrack to the second season of the television show.\n\n\nThe Birds, The Bees & The Monkees\nNo longer desiring to work as a group, the Monkees dropped Chip Douglas as a producer, and starting in November 1967, they largely produced their own sessions [53] Although credited to the whole band, the songs were mostly solo efforts [57] In a couple of cases, Boyce and Hart had returned from the first two albums to produce, but credit was given to the Monkees due to contractual requirements [58]\n\n\nBeyond television and Head\nAs the second season of the television series was being produced,

year, equal to about $1,250,000 per year today [when?] Tork departed shortly after the band's September–October Far East tour in December 1968 and after the band completed work on their 1969 NBC television special, 33⅓ Revolutions Per Monkee (which rehashed many of the ideas from Head, only with the Monkees playing a strangely second-string role) In the DVD commentary for the television special, Dolenz noted that after filming was complete, Nesmith gave Tork a gold watch as a going-away present, engraved \"From the guys down at work.\" Most of the songs from the 33 1/3 Revolutions Per Monkee TV Special were not officially released until over 40 years later, on the 2010 and 2011 Rhino Handmade Deluxe boxed sets of Head and Instant Replay.\n\n\nTork's resignation, Instant Replay

14, 1970, Nesmith joined Dolenz and Jones for the last time as part of the original incarnation of the Monkees to film a Kool-Aid commercial (with the then-newly introduced Nerf balls, thrown around a mock living room by the trio, available as a premium for Kool-Aid labels), [79] with Nesmith leaving the group to continue recording songs with his own country-rock group called Michael Nesmith & the First National Band, which he had started recording with on February 10, 1970 [80]\n\n\nReunions and revivals\nWith repeats of the television series The Monkees airing on Saturday mornings and in syndication, the group once again appeared on the charts in 1976 with The Monkees Greatest Hits The LP, issued by Arista Records (who by this time had possession of the Monkees' master tapes courtesy of their corporate owner, Screen Gems), was actually a re-packaging of an earlier (1972) compilation LP called Refocus that had been issued by Arista's previous label imprint, Bell Records Dolenz and

late 1960s as manufactured and lacking talent, the Monkees experienced a critical and commercial renaissance two decades later A Monkees TV show marathon (\"Pleasant Valley Sunday\") was broadcast on February 23, 1986, on MTV Nickelodeon began to run the Monkees' old television series daily Such promotion helped to resurrect a smaller version of Monkeemania, leading to tour dates that grew from smaller to larger venues and became one of the biggest live acts of 1986 and 1987.\n\n\nNew Monkees\nIn 1987, a new television series called New Monkees appeared Other than centering on a boy band quartet, it bore no resemblance to the earlier series or group The New Monkees left the air after 13 episodes.\n\n\n1990s reunions\nIn the 1990s, the Monkees continued to record new material The band also re-issued all its original LPs on CD Most of them included between three and six bonus tracks of previously unreleased songs or alternate takes; the first editions came with collectable trading cards.\n\n\n2000s reunions\nAfter the 1997 tours, the group took another hiatus until they once again reunited in 2001 to tour the United States However, this tour was also accompanied by public sniping Dolenz and Jones had announced that they had \"fired\" Tork for his constant complaining and threatening to quit Tork was quoted as confirming this, as well as stating that he wanted to tour with his own band, Shoe Suede Blues Tork told WENN News that he \"couldn't handle the backstage problems\"; he added that because he was a recovering alcoholic, he was troubled by the overindulgence

with the Monkees since 1997 [100] Jones's memory was honored throughout the shows via recordings and video During one point, the band went quiet and a recording of Jones singing \"I Wanna Be Free\" played while footage of him was screening behind the band For Jones's signature song, \"Daydream Believer\", Dolenz said that the band had discussed who should sing the song and had concluded that it should be the fans, saying \"It doesn't belong to us anymore It belongs to you.\" [101]\n\n\nGood Times! and 50th anniversary\nDolenz and Tork toured as the Monkees in 2015 without Nesmith's participation Nesmith stated that he was busy with other ventures, although Dolenz said that he was welcome to join them [104]\n\n\nThe Mike and Micky Show, Christmas Party, and Tork's death\nOn February 20, 2018, a new tour was announced as \"The Monkees Present: The Mike and Micky Show\", their first tour as a duo; Tork was unable to participate due to health problems (a fact that was not revealed until after his death) Though the pair played Monkees music and promoted the tour under the Monkees banner, Dolenz and Nesmith respected Tork's absence by insisting that the shows be billed as a separate duo rather than being billed as official Monkees shows Nesmith stated, \"There's no pretense there about Micky and I being the Monkees We're not.\" [108]\n\n\nFarewell tour and Nesmith's death\nFollowing the success of the Mike and Micky Show, Dolenz and Nesmith announced a follow-up tour, An Evening with the Monkees, to begin in early 2020 [113] The tour was delayed, however, due the

the recognition that the Monkees were neither the first manufactured group nor unusual in this respect The Monkees also frequently contributed their own songwriting efforts on their albums and saw their musical skills improve They ultimately became a self-directed group, playing their own instruments and writing many of their own songs.\n\n\nIn popular culture\nThe Criterion Collection, which has a stated goal to release \"a continuing series of important classic and contemporary films,  [and] has been dedicated to gathering the greatest films from around the world and publishing them in

through a ruined cityscape at night, before running into a shadowy figure she believes to be her late mother On her way to school one morning, Suzume meets a young man searching for abandoned locations with doors She tells him of a nearby abandoned onsen resort, and curiously follows him There, she discovers a door free-standing on its frame Suzume opens it to see a starlit field through the doorway, which she cannot enter She then trips over a cat statue on the floor, which turns into a real cat and flees Frightened, Suzume rushes to school.\n\n\nVoice cast\nMakoto Shinkai conceived the idea for Suzume while he was traveling around Japan to give talks about his past works He said, \"In Japan, it is customary to hold a jichinsai or groundbreaking ceremony, before construction begins on a new building or home, but we do nothing when we close them down.\" Shinkai noticed that there were more empty or abandoned areas in Japan due to the country's declining birth rate and

into a road movie about visiting places [14]\n\n\nCharacters\nShinkai immediately decided for the film to have a female main character, since Weathering with You had a male main character, and also felt that a \"buddy\" character was necessary [13] Initially, he wanted Suzume's companion to be another girl, with a \"sisterhood type of romantic story\", as he believed that he had exhausted the potential of the \"boy meets girl\" formula in previous films However, Shinkai's producer discouraged the idea, saying that the audience for his films was still enjoying the typical romance aspects of his films [19] [20] Thus, making the partner a chair was decided upon both to avoid the film becoming \"too much of a romance,\" [19] and also to lighten the mood of the film, which would \"inevitably become quieter\" if the story focused on mourning a place [13] Shinkai also considered other options for potential partners, [13] such as a partner that turns into a monster throughout the story, and other \"inorganic partners\" like a milk carton [13] The idea for a chair partner came when Shinkai saw a wooden chair sitting at a deserted bus stop, and found its \"foreign feeling\" to be better than any of his previous ideas Shinkai also became less interested in writing a love story and wanted to depict different relationships, like with Suzume and her aunt [13]\n\n\nCasting\nNanoka Hara

Munakata was revealed He described the character as one that \" [he] had never seen in any of the director's works\" Therefore, Matsumura gave a voice for Souta that he \"had never heard before,\" which involved using a slightly lower tone Shinkai found his voice to be \"impressive\" and said that it \"embodies the character\" [22] These were Hara and Matsumura's first anime voice-acting roles

become quieter\" if the story focused on mourning a place [13] Shinkai also considered other options for potential partners, [13] such as a partner that turns into a monster throughout the story, and other \"inorganic partners\" like a milk carton [13] The idea for a chair partner came when Shinkai saw a wooden chair sitting at a deserted bus stop, and found its \"foreign feeling\" to be better than any of his previous ideas Shinkai also became less interested in writing a love story and wanted to depict different relationships, like with Suzume and her aunt [13]\n\n\nCasting\nNanoka Hara

imagine being the one to share the \"unforgettable, heart-shaking sensation\" she felt when first seeing one of his films in theaters [5] [21] On September 6, 2022, Hokuto Matsumura's role as Souta Munakata was revealed He described the character as one that \" [he] had never seen in any of the director's works\" Therefore, Matsumura gave a voice for Souta that he \"had never heard before,\" which involved using a slightly lower tone Shinkai found his voice to be \"impressive\" and said that it \"embodies the character\" [22] These were Hara and Matsumura's first anime voice-acting roles [5] [22] On September 29, Eri Fukatsu, Shota Sometani, Sairi Ito, Kotone Hanase, Kana Hanazawa, and Matsumoto Hakuō II were revealed to be joining the voice cast [8] On October 25, Ryūnosuke Kamiki,

and NATO have a long-standing relationship that has evolved over the years. Sweden's foreign policy has traditionally been one of neutrality, but in recent years, the country has been moving closer to NATO. In 2022, Sweden and Finland submitted their applications to join the alliance, marking a significant shift in their relations.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nSweden's relationship with NATO dates back to the founding of the alliance in 1949. At that time, Sweden chose not to join NATO, instead adopting a policy of neutrality. This policy was driven by a desire to avoid taking sides in the Cold War and to maintain good relations with both the Western and Eastern blocs. Over the years, Sweden's neutrality policy has been guided by a commitment to maintaining peace and stability in the region.\n\n**History**\n\nSweden adopted a policy of neutrality following the loss of a large amount of its territory (including Finland) to the Russian Empire during the Napoleonic Wars in 1812.

{"title": "Sovereign_citizen_movement", "content": "\nHistory\nThe sovereign citizen movement originated from a combination of tax protester ideas, of the radical and racist anti-government movements in the 1960s and 1970s, [20] and of pseudolaw, which has existed in the United States since at least the 1950s [6] Their belief in the illegitimacy of federal income tax gradually expanded to challenging the legitimacy of the government [3]\n\n\nOrigin\nThe sovereign citizen movement originated from a combination of tax protester ideas, of the radical and racist anti-government movements in the 1960s and 1970s, [20] and of pseudolaw, which has existed in the United States since at least the 1950s [6] Their belief in the illegitimacy of federal income tax gradually expanded to challenging the legitimacy of the government [3]\n\n\nDevelopments\nIn the early 1980s,  Gordon Kahl, a former Posse Comitatus member, helped radicalize sovereign citizen anti-government rhetoric Kahl considered that the government was not only illegitimate but actively hostile to the interests of Americans After Kahl was killed in 1983 during a shootout with law enforcement, he was considered a martyr within the movement, which helped disseminate his views [22]\n\n\nSpread\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, sovereign citizen ideology was introduced into Canada and then gradually into other countries [6] as the advent of the Internet facilitated communications between people sharing the same ideas [20] One influential American \"guru\" who helped spread sovereign citizen ideology abroad was Winston Shrout, who held seminars in Canada (until he was banned from the country), Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom [33]\n\n\nGovernment response\nFollowing the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, U.S federal law enforcement began cracking down on white supremacist groups, including sovereign citizen organizations The Montana Freemen incident occurred in that context [9] The bombing also led Congress to pass the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, enhancing sentences for certain terrorism-related offenses [50]\n\n\nDenominations and symbols\nNot all members of the movement describe themselves as \"sovereign citizens\", and some movement members actually regard the term \"sovereign citizen\" as an oxymoron [31] Sovereign citizens may prefer to label themselves as \"state nationals\", [57] \"constitutionalists\", \"freemen\", [58] \"natural people\", \"living people\", [1] \"private persons\", [59] or as people \"seeking the truth\" [60] or \"living on the land\" [59] The name \"American State National\" [40] (ASN) became popular among sovereign citizens in the early 2020s, especially among followers of the  far-right QAnon conspiracy theory [61]\n\n\nTheories\nThe movement has no defining text, established doctrine, or centralized leadership [8] [63] There are, however, common themes, generally implying that the legitimate government and legal system have been somehow replaced and that the current authorities are devoid of legitimacy Taxes and licenses are likewise thought to be illegitimate A number of leaders, commonly referred to as \"gurus\", develop their own variations [8] [34] The movement's theories include numerous influences from a variety of sources, some of them decades old, resulting in a narrative of American history that is often confusing and incoherent [64]\n\n\nIllegitimacy of laws and government\nA widespread belief among sovereign citizens is that the state is not an actual government, but a corporation American movement members consider that the corporation that purports to be the U.S federal government is illegally controlling the republic via a territorial government in Washington, DC [57]\n\n\nCitizenship\nAmerican sovereign citizens posit that contemporary United States citizenship is somehow defective or fraudulent and that it curtails citizens' legitimate rights Some sovereign citizens also claim that they can become immune to most or all laws of the United States by renouncing citizenship in a \"federal corporation\" and declaring only to be a citizen of the state where they reside: this process, which they refer to as \"expatriation\", involves filing or delivering a nonlegal document claiming their renunciation of citizenship to any county clerk's office that can be convinced to accept it [74]\n\n\nDual personas\nOne recurring idea in sovereign citizen ideology is that individuals have two personas, one of flesh and blood and the other a separate, secret, legal personality (commonly called the \"strawman\"), created upon each person's birth, that is subject to the government Sovereign citizens claim that it is possible to dissociate oneself from the \"strawman\" through the use of certain procedures, thus becoming free of all debts, liabilities and legal constraints [6] [10] [26] [69]\n\n\nEconomics\nSovereign citizen texts often posit that \"international bankers\" are at the source of the conspiracy that replaced the United States' legitimate government and legal system In the movement's earlier form, these bankers were explicitly stated to be Jews While this can still be implied in sovereign citizen literature, the movement's original antisemitic conspiracy theories were diluted over time; most contemporary sovereign citizens tend to present greatly simplified versions of these theories, without any mentions of Jewish conspiracies and with only vague references to the role of corrupt bankers [64]\n\n\nFreedom of movement\nUsing arguments that rely on exacting definitions and word choice, sovereign citizens may assert a constitutional \"right to travel\" in a \"conveyance\", distinguishing it from driving an automobile in order to justify ignoring requirements for license plates, vehicle registration, insurances, and driver's licenses The right to travel is claimed based on a variety of passages, some being more commonly used among groups [13] [63] [65]\n\n\nOther\nCalifornia drought manipulation\n\n\nTactics\nSovereign citizens may be affiliated with a group within the movement, follow the teachings of a specific \"guru\", or act entirely on their own By disobeying rules they consider to be illegitimate, they regularly find themselves in conflict with all forms of government institutions, most commonly law enforcement, the judiciary, and the revenue services [13] One sovereign citizen from Montana, Ernie Wayne terTelgte, became a local celebrity by engaging in 2013 in a protracted legal battle with authorities over the need to have a fishing license [90] and then having multiple incidents with law enforcement over this matter, as well as his lack of a driver's license [91]\n\n\nTraffic law violations\nSovereign citizens consistently violate traffic laws by refusing to use driver's licenses, valid license plates, and to register or insure their vehicles [63] [13] Some use homemade license plates and bumper stickers, which can serve the unintended purpose of warning police officers that they are dealing with a sovereign citizen Most interactions of sovereign citizens with law enforcement take place on the road As a result, the general public is mostly familiar with the movement through online videos of sovereign citizens' confrontations with traffic officers [63]\n\n\nAnti-tax and other financial schemes\nMany sovereign citizens engage in various forms of tax resistance, causing disputes with government administrations [68] [93] It is estimated that in the United States, sovereign citizens and other tax protesters have caused about $1 billion in public losses from 1990 to 2013 [84]\n\n\nDocuments and formalities\nSovereign citizens are known to create their own irregular, pseudolegal documents, including false passports, license plates, or birth certificates [99] Sovereign citizen documents may include unusual formalities, such as maxims written in Latin, thumbprints, or stamps in certain places, as well as unconventional, sometimes incomprehensible legalese Stamps are generally accompanied by signatures (with the sovereign citizen's name signed across them), initials or other markings [8] [70] [97]\n\n\nLitigation and court cases\nCases involving sovereign citizens can cause severe problems to law enforcement officers and court officials [10] Sovereign citizens may challenge the laws, rules, or sentences they disagree with by engaging in the practice known as paper terrorism, which involves filing complaints with legal documents that may be bogus or simply misused Minor issues such as traffic violations or disagreements over pet-licensing fees may provoke numerous court filings Courts will then find themselves burdened with having to process hundreds of pages of irregular, pseudolegal documents, causing a strain on their resources [2] [68] [13] [3] [8]\n\n\nFalse liens and other harassment tactics\nBesides paper terrorism, sovereign citizens have used various techniques of intimidation and harassment to achieve their goals [13] One method of retaliation used by sovereign citizens against public officials, or against other real or perceived enemies, is the filing of false liens Anyone can file a notice of lien against property such as real estate, vehicles, or other assets of another In most U.S states, the validity of liens is not investigated or inquired into at the time of filing Notices of liens (whether legally valid or not) are a cloud on the title of the property and may affect the property owner's credit rating and ability to obtain home equity loans or refinance the property Clearing up fraudulent notices of liens may be expensive and time-consuming [10]\n\n\nLegal status of theories\nSovereign citizens' tactics often succeed in delaying legal proceedings and may occasionally confuse or exhaust public officials [2] [8] [86] However, their arguments are never upheld in court [6] Their claims have been consistently rejected by courts in various countries, including the United States, Canada, [6] [97] Australia, [108] and New Zealand [109] Mark Pitcavage, a researcher working for the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism, has summed up sovereign citizen ideology as \"magical thinking\" [110] One state representative from New Hampshire, Richard Marple, repeatedly tried to introduce legislation that would recognize sovereign citizen ideas, though without success [12]\n\n\nImmunity from laws and taxes\nPseudolegal documents and arguments claiming that one is personally immune from jurisdiction or should not be paying taxes have never been accepted by any court [70] [111] The conception that one can avoid paying taxes in the country they physically reside in by renouncing or challenging the validity of their citizenship and by claiming to be a \"non-resident alien\" is legally baseless The Internal Revenue Service has refuted in detail \"frivolous tax arguments\" such as this and the idea that filing tax returns and paying Federal Income tax are \"voluntary\" [112] [113]\n\n\nStrawman theory and redemption schemes\nThe core redemption/A4V theory that people possess vast sums of money hidden from them by the government in a secret account, and that this money can be unlocked through specific means, has no basis in reality Likewise, the strawman theory has been repeatedly dismissed by courts Both theories are listed by the FBI as common fraud schemes [136] In 2021, the District Court of Queensland dismissed an application that relied on the strawman theory, commenting that this argument \"may properly be described as nonsense or gobbledygook\" [137] \nRedemption methods such as \"Accepted for Value\" are based on a misinterpretation of the Uniform Commercial Code and have no effect [26]\n\n\nTraffic\nSovereign citizens' argument that they do not need driver's licenses, license plates, and vehicle insurances has never been upheld in court [63] One common response to this claim from U.S law enforcement is that, while anyone is free to \"travel\" by foot, by bike or even by horse, operating a motor vehicle is a complex activity that requires training and licensure [52]\n\n\nSovereign citizen legal entities\nSovereign citizens' \"common law courts\" and other \"legal\" entities lack any legitimacy Some may be simply ignored by authorities: in 2015, sovereign citizen \"guru\" Anna Maria Riezinger aka Anna von Reitz, the self-proclaimed \"judge\" of a common law court in Alaska, [31] published a letter calling for federal agents to arrest President Barack Obama, the entire Congress and the Secretary of the Treasury, [57] causing a minor Internet rumor Snopes debunked her claim by establishing that von Reitz was not a real judge and that her \"orders\" therefore had no force [149]\n\n\nOther arguments and schemes\nThe claim that the District of Columbia Organic Act of 1871 turned the United States into a business corporation is based on a misunderstanding of the term municipal corporation used in the Act (which referred to the District of Columbia and not to the entire country) [166] [167] and on a misinterpretation of a provision in Title 28 of the United States Code, which includes a definition of the United States as a \"federal corporation\" (meaning a group authorized to legally act as a single entity and not a business corporation) [64]\n\n\nGroups outside the United States\nThere is some cross-over between the two groups calling themselves freemen on the land and sovereign citizens, as well as various others sharing similar beliefs, which may be loosely defined as \"see [ing] the state as a corporation with no authority over free citizens\" [20]\n\n\nEnglish-speaking countries\nWith the advent of the Internet and continuing during the 21st century, people throughout the Anglosphere who share the core beliefs of these movements have been able to connect and share their ideas While arguments specific to the history and laws of the United States are not used (except inadvertently, by litigants who use poorly adapted U.S material), [97] many concepts have been incorporated or adopted by individuals and groups in English-speaking Commonwealth countries [20] [174] In Canada, which has its own tradition of tax protesters, [175] fiscal misconceptions of American origin were gradually introduced during the 1980s and 1990s [4]\n\n\nCanada\nWhilst the more Canada-specific freeman on the land movement has declined since the early 2010s, [4] the Canadian sovereign citizen movement has gained traction during the same period [179] Canada had an estimated 30,000 sovereign citizens in 2015, many associating with the freeman on the land movement as well [180] There can be confusion between the two populations [35] [181]\n\n\nAustralia\nAustralia, which has its own tradition of pseudolaw, imported sovereign citizen ideas in the 1990s, even before the movement's 2000s resurgence It later imported the more Commonwealth-specific freeman on the land movement [4] There is some cross-over between Australian freemen on the land, [183] local sovereign citizens groups, and some others [20] [183] The core concept has been tested by several court cases, none successful for the \"freemen\" [184] In 2011, climate denier and political activist Malcolm Roberts (later elected senator for Pauline Hanson's One Nation party), wrote a letter to then Prime Minister Julia Gillard filled with characteristic sovereign citizen ideas and vocabulary, although he denied that he was a \"sovereign citizen\" [185] [186]\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\nSovereign citizen ideology reached the United Kingdom around 2010 [34] British sovereign citizens have helped spread COVID vaccine misinformation as well as various conspiracy theories – including 9/11 theories and one about the Queen having been replaced by a satanic cabal – and tried to set up their own cryptocurrency The Common Law Court website, one of the main UK sovereign citizen resources, has for a time supported an impostor who claimed to be the rightful heir to the British throne [44]\n\n\nAustria and Germany\nThe Reichsbürger movement (Reich citizen movement) in Germany originated around 1985 and had approximately 19,000 members in 2019, more concentrated in the south and east The originator claimed to have been appointed head of the post-World War I Reich, but other leaders claim imperial authority The movement consists of different, usually small groups Some groups have issued passports and identification cards [193] [194] The Reichsbürger movement claims that modern day Germany is not a sovereign state but a corporation created by Allied nations after World War II They also expressed their hope that Donald Trump would lead an army to restore the Reich [195] According to the German domestic intelligence service, only a small number of groups in the Reich citizen movement fall into the far-right spectrum Rather, the common denominator is the rejection of the Federal Republic as a legal entity [196] The Reichsbürger movement has used language and techniques from the One People's Public Trust, an American sovereign citizen group operated by \"guru\" Heather Ann Tucci-Jarraf [87] On December 7, 2022, 25 people connected to the Reichsbürger movement were arrested in a nationwide raid by German police forces, for their involvement in a suspected terrorist plot against the German government and institutions [197]\n\n\nItaly\nAs of the 2010s, incidents involving sovereign citizens have been reported in Italy, with various people purporting to opt out of Italian citizenship through nonlegal procedures and make themselves immune from Italian law Members of one group attempt to do so by declaring themselves citizens of the \"Sovereign Kingdom of Gaia\" (Regno Sovrano di Gaia) while others refer to themselves as the \"People of Mother Earth\" (Popolo della Terra Madre) [201] Another group called \"We is, I am\" (Noi è, Io sono) was reported in 2023 This movement is connected with American \"guru\" Heather Ann Tucci-Jarraf [202] and, according to Italian media, had about 10 000 followers in 2023 [203] [204]\n\n\nRussia\nA Russian movement of conspiracy theorists, known among other names as the Union of Slavic Forces of Russia (Soyuz slavyanskikh sil Rusi), or more informally as \"Soviet Citizens\", holds that the Soviet Union still exists de jure and that the current Russian government and legislation are thus illegitimate One of its beliefs is that the government of the Russian Federation is an offshore company through which the United States illegally controls the country [205] [206] [207]\n\n\nFrance and Belgium\nIn France, pseudolegal arguments claiming that enacted laws were invalid became gradually popular during the 2010s among conspiracy theorists They gained more traction during the Yellow vests protests, with claims that the Constitution of France was null and void [208]\n\n\nCzech Republic\nThe movement was first covered by Czech media in 2022, when the government noticed an increasing number of people submitting a \"sworn declaration of life\" and demanding to terminate a contract with the \"Czech Republic corporation\" [216] [217] It gained further traction in the middle of 2023, when sovereign citizen movement followers tried to interrupt multiple court proceedings  involving disseminators of COVID-19 and Ukraine war  disinformation, demanding that the judges \"identify\" themselves [218] [219] The movement was also connected to a case of a family with two unregistered children living in a yurt near Náchod [220]\n\n\nSee also\nCalifornia drought

"**Sovereign Citizen Movement**\n\nThe sovereign citizen movement is a loosely connected network of individuals and groups who reject the legitimacy of governments and the law. This movement has its roots in the United States, but has spread to other countries, including Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, Austria, Germany, Italy, Russia, France, Belgium, and the Czech Republic.\n\n**History**\n\nThe sovereign citizen movement originated from a combination of tax protester ideas, radical and racist anti-government movements in the 1960s and 1970s, and pseudolaw, which has existed in the United States since at least the 1950s. Their belief in the illegitimacy of federal income tax gradually expanded to challenging the legitimacy of the government.\n\n**Origin**\n\nThe sovereign citizen movement originated from a combination of tax protester ideas, radical and racist anti-government movements in the 1960s and 1970s, and pseudolaw, which has existed in the United States since at least the 1950s. Their belief in the illegitimacy of federal income tax gradually expanded to challenging the legitimacy of the government.\n\n**Developments**\n\nIn the early 1980s, Gordon Kahl, a former Posse Comitatus member, helped radicalize sovereign citizen anti-government rhetoric. Kahl considered that the government was not only illegitimate but actively hostile to the interests of Americans. After Kahl was killed in 1983 during a shootout with law enforcement, he was considered a martyr within the movement, which helped disseminate his views.\n\n**Spread**\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, sovereign citizen ideology was introduced into Canada and then gradually into other countries as the advent of the Internet facilitated communications between people sharing the same ideas. One influential American \"guru\" who helped spread sovereign citizen ideology abroad was Winston Shrout, who held seminars in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.\n\n**Government Response**\n\nFollowing the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, U.S federal law enforcement began cracking down on white supremacist groups, including sovereign citizen organizations. The Montana Freemen incident occurred in this context. The bombing also led Congress to pass the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, enhancing sentences for certain terrorism-related offenses.\n\n**Denominations and Symbols**\n\nNot all members of the movement describe themselves as \"sovereign citizens,\" and some movement members actually regard the term \"sovereign citizen\" as an oxymoron. Sovereign citizens may prefer to label themselves as \"state nationals,\" \"constitutionalists,\" \"freemen,\" \"natural people,\" \"living people,\" \"private persons,\" or as people \"seeking the truth\" or \"living on the land.\" The name \"American State National\" (ASN) became popular among sovereign citizens in the early 2020s, especially among followers of the far-right QAnon conspiracy theory.\n\n**Theories**\n\nThe movement has no defining text, established doctrine, or centralized leadership. There are, however, common themes, generally implying that the legitimate government and legal system have been somehow replaced and that the current authorities are devoid of legitimacy. Taxes and licenses are likewise thought to be illegitimate. A number of leaders, commonly referred to as \"gurus,\" develop their own variations. The movement's theories include numerous influences from a variety of sources, some of them decades old, resulting in a narrative of American history that is often confusing and incoherent.\n\n**Illegitimacy of Laws and Government**\n\nA widespread belief among sovereign citizens is that the state is not an actual government, but a corporation. American movement members consider that the corporation that purports to be the U.S federal government is illegally controlling the republic via a territorial government in Washington, D.C.\n\n**Citizenship**\n\nAmerican sovereign citizens posit that contemporary United States citizenship is somehow defective or fraudulent and that it curtails citizens' legitimate rights. Some sovereign citizens also claim that they can become immune to most or all laws of the United States by renouncing citizenship in a \"federal corporation\" and declaring only to be a citizen of the state where they reside.\n\n**Dual Personas**\n\nOne recurring idea in sovereign citizen ideology is that individuals have two personas, one of flesh and blood and the other a separate, secret, legal personality (commonly called the \"strawman\"), created upon each person's birth, that is subject to the government. Sovereign citizens claim that it is possible to dissociate oneself from the \"strawman\" through the use of certain procedures, thus becoming free of all debts, liabilities, and legal constraints.\n\n**Economics**\n\nSovereign citizen texts often posit that \"international bankers\" are at the source of the conspiracy that replaced the United States' legitimate government and legal system. In the movement's earlier form, these bankers were explicitly stated to be Jews. While this can still be implied in sovereign citizen literature, the movement's original antisemitic conspiracy theories were diluted over time; most contemporary sovereign citizens tend to present greatly simplified versions of these theories, without any mentions of Jewish conspiracies and with only vague references to the role of corrupt bankers.\n\n**Freedom of Movement**\n\nUsing arguments that rely on exacting definitions and word choice, sovereign citizens may assert a constitutional \"right to travel\" in a \"conveyance,\" distinguishing it from driving an automobile in order to justify ignoring requirements for license plates, vehicle registration, insurances, and driver's licenses.\n\n**Other**\n\nSovereign citizens may be affiliated with a group within the movement, follow the teachings of a specific \"guru,\" or act entirely on their own. By disobeying rules they consider to be illegitimate, they regularly find themselves in conflict with all forms of government institutions, most commonly law enforcement, the judiciary, and the revenue services.\n\n**Traffic Law Violations**\n\nSovereign citizens consistently violate traffic laws by refusing to use driver's licenses, valid license plates, and to register or insure their vehicles. Some use homemade license plates and bumper stickers, which can serve the unintended purpose of warning police officers that they are dealing with a sovereign citizen. Most interactions of sovereign citizens with law enforcement take place on the road.\n\n**Anti-Tax and Other Financial Schemes**\n\nMany sovereign citizens engage in various forms of tax resistance, causing disputes with government administrations. It is estimated that in the United States, sovereign citizens and other tax protesters have caused about $1 billion in public losses from 1990 to 2013.\n\n**Documents and Formalities**\n\nSovereign citizens are known to create their own irregular, pseudolegal documents, including false passports, license plates, or birth certificates. Sovereign citizen documents may include unusual formalities, such as maxims written in Latin, thumbprints, or stamps in certain places, as well as unconventional, sometimes incomprehensible legalese.\n\n**Litigation and Court Cases**\n\nCases involving sovereign citizens can cause severe problems to law enforcement officers and court officials. Sovereign citizens may challenge the laws, rules, or sentences they disagree with by engaging in the practice known as paper terrorism, which involves filing complaints with legal documents that may be bogus or simply misused.\n\n**False Liens and Other Harassment Tactics**\n\nBesides paper terrorism, sovereign citizens have used various techniques of intimidation and harassment to achieve their goals.

burdened with having to process hundreds of pages of irregular, pseudolegal documents, causing a strain on their resources [2] [68] [13] [3] [8]\n\n\nFalse liens and other harassment tactics\nBesides paper terrorism, sovereign citizens have used various techniques of intimidation and harassment to achieve their goals [13] One method of retaliation used by sovereign citizens against public officials, or against other real or perceived enemies, is the filing of false liens Anyone can file a notice of lien against property such as real estate, vehicles, or other assets of another In most U.S states, the validity of liens is not investigated or inquired into at the time of filing Notices of liens (whether legally valid or not) are a cloud on the title of the property and may affect the property owner's credit rating and ability to obtain home equity loans or refinance the property Clearing up fraudulent notices of liens may be expensive and time-consuming [10]\n\n\nLegal status of theories\nSovereign citizens' tactics often succeed in delaying legal proceedings and may occasionally confuse or exhaust public officials [2] [8] [86] However, their arguments are never upheld in court [6] Their claims have been consistently rejected by courts in various countries, including the United States, Canada, [6] [97] Australia, [108] and New Zealand [109] Mark Pitcavage, a researcher working for the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism, has summed up sovereign citizen ideology as \"magical thinking\" [110] One state representative from New Hampshire, Richard Marple, repeatedly tried to introduce legislation that would recognize sovereign citizen ideas, though without success [12]\n\n\nImmunity from laws and taxes\nPseudolegal documents and arguments claiming that one is personally immune from jurisdiction or should not be paying taxes have never been accepted by any court [70] [111] The conception that one can avoid paying taxes in the country they physically reside in by renouncing or challenging the validity of their citizenship and by claiming to be a \"non-resident alien\" is legally baseless The Internal Revenue Service has refuted in detail \"frivolous tax arguments\" such as this and the idea that filing tax returns and paying Federal Income tax are \"voluntary\" [112] [113]\n\n\nStrawman theory and redemption schemes\nThe core redemption/A4V theory that people possess vast sums of money hidden from them by the government in a secret account, and that this money can be unlocked through specific means, has no basis in reality Likewise, the strawman theory has been repeatedly dismissed by courts Both theories are listed by the FBI as common fraud schemes [136] In 2021, the District Court of Queensland dismissed an application that relied on the strawman theory, commenting that this argument \"may properly be described as nonsense or gobbledygook\" [137] \nRedemption methods such as \"Accepted for Value\" are based on a misinterpretation of the Uniform Commercial Code and have no effect [26]\n\n\nTraffic\nSovereign citizens' argument that they do not need driver's licenses, license plates, and vehicle insurances has never been upheld in court [63] One common response to this claim from U.S law enforcement is that, while anyone is free to \"travel\" by foot, by bike or even by horse, operating a motor vehicle is a complex activity that requires training and licensure [52]\n\n\nSovereign citizen legal entities\nSovereign citizens' \"common law courts\" and other \"legal\" entities lack any legitimacy Some may be simply ignored by authorities: in 2015, sovereign citizen \"guru\" Anna Maria Riezinger aka Anna von Reitz, the self-proclaimed \"judge\" of a common law court in Alaska, [31] published a letter calling for federal agents to arrest President Barack Obama, the entire Congress and the Secretary of the Treasury, [57] causing a minor Internet rumor Snopes debunked her claim by establishing that von Reitz was not a real judge and that her \"orders\" therefore had no force [149]\n\n\nOther arguments and schemes\nThe claim that the District of Columbia Organic Act of 1871 turned the United States into a business corporation is based on a misunderstanding of the term municipal corporation used in the Act (which referred to the District of Columbia and not to the entire country) [166] [167] and on a misinterpretation of a provision in Title 28 of the United States Code, which includes a definition of the United States as a \"federal corporation\" (meaning a group authorized to legally act as a single entity and not a business corporation) [64]\n\n\nGroups outside the United States\nThere is some cross-over between the two groups calling themselves freemen on the land and sovereign citizens, as well as various others sharing similar beliefs, which may be loosely defined as \"see [ing] the state as a corporation with no authority over free citizens\" [20]\n\n\nEnglish-speaking countries\nWith the advent of the Internet and continuing during the 21st century, people throughout the Anglosphere who share the core beliefs of these movements have been able to connect and share their ideas While arguments specific to the history and laws of the United States are not used (except inadvertently, by litigants who use poorly adapted U.S material), [97] many concepts have been incorporated or adopted by individuals and groups in English-speaking Commonwealth countries [20] [174] In Canada, which has its own tradition of tax protesters, [175] fiscal misconceptions of American origin were gradually introduced during the 1980s and 1990s [4]\n\n\nCanada\nWhilst the more Canada-specific freeman on the land movement has declined since the early 2010s, [4] the Canadian sovereign citizen movement has gained traction during the same period [179] Canada had an estimated 30,000 sovereign citizens in 2015, many associating with the freeman on the land movement as well [180] There can be confusion between the two populations [35] [181]\n\n\nAustralia\nAustralia, which has its own tradition of pseudolaw, imported sovereign citizen ideas in the 1990s, even before the movement's 2000s resurgence It later imported the more Commonwealth-specific freeman on the land movement [4] There is some cross-over between Australian freemen on the land, [183] local sovereign citizens groups, and some others [20] [183] The core concept has been tested by several court cases, none successful for the \"freemen\" [184] In 2011, climate denier and political activist Malcolm Roberts (later elected senator for Pauline Hanson's One Nation party), wrote a letter to then Prime Minister Julia Gillard filled with characteristic sovereign citizen ideas and vocabulary, although he denied that he was a \"sovereign citizen\" [185] [186]\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\nSovereign citizen ideology reached the United Kingdom around 2010 [34] British sovereign citizens have helped spread COVID vaccine misinformation as well as various conspiracy theories – including 9/11 theories and one about the Queen having been replaced by a satanic cabal – and tried to set up their own cryptocurrency The Common Law Court website, one of the main UK sovereign citizen resources, has for a time supported an impostor who claimed to be the rightful heir to the British throne [44]\n\n\nAustria and Germany\nThe Reichsbürger movement (Reich citizen movement) in Germany originated around 1985 and had approximately 19,000 members in 2019, more concentrated in the south and east The originator claimed to have been appointed head of the post-World War I Reich, but other leaders claim imperial authority The movement consists of different, usually small groups Some groups have issued passports and identification cards [193] [194] The Reichsbürger movement claims that modern day Germany is not a sovereign state but a corporation created by Allied nations after World War II They also expressed their hope that Donald Trump would lead an army to restore the Reich [195] According to the German domestic intelligence service, only a small number of groups in the Reich citizen movement fall into the far-right spectrum Rather, the common denominator is the rejection of the Federal Republic as a legal entity [196] The Reichsbürger movement has used language and techniques from the One People's Public Trust, an American sovereign citizen group operated by \"guru\" Heather Ann Tucci-Jarraf [87] On December 7, 2022, 25 people connected to the Reichsbürger movement were arrested in a nationwide raid by German police forces, for their involvement in a suspected terrorist plot against the German government and institutions [197]\n\n\nItaly\nAs of the 2010s, incidents involving sovereign citizens have been reported in Italy, with various people purporting to opt out of Italian citizenship through nonlegal procedures and make themselves immune from Italian law Members of one group attempt to do so by declaring themselves citizens of the \"Sovereign Kingdom of Gaia\" (Regno Sovrano di Gaia) while others refer to themselves as the \"People of Mother Earth\" (Popolo della Terra Madre) [201] Another group called \"We is, I am\" (Noi è, Io sono) was reported in 2023 This movement is connected with American \"guru\" Heather Ann Tucci-Jarraf [202] and, according to Italian media, had about 10 000 followers in 2023 [203] [204]\n\n\nRussia\nA Russian movement of conspiracy theorists, known among other names as the Union of Slavic Forces of Russia (Soyuz slavyanskikh sil Rusi), or more informally as \"Soviet Citizens\", holds that the Soviet Union still exists de jure and that the current Russian government and legislation are thus illegitimate One of its beliefs is that the government of the Russian Federation is an offshore company through which the United States illegally controls the country [205] [206] [207]\n\n\nFrance and Belgium\nIn France, pseudolegal arguments claiming that enacted laws were invalid became gradually popular during the 2010s among conspiracy theorists They gained more traction during the Yellow vests protests, with claims that the Constitution of France was null and void [208]\n\n\nCzech Republic\nThe movement was first covered by Czech media in 2022, when the government noticed an increasing number of people submitting a \"sworn declaration of life\" and demanding to terminate a contract with the \"Czech Republic corporation\" [216] [217] It gained further traction in the middle of 2023, when sovereign citizen movement followers tried to interrupt multiple court proceedings  involving disseminators of COVID-19 and Ukraine war  disinformation, demanding that the judges \"identify\" themselves [218] [219] The movement was also connected to a case of a family with two unregistered children living in a yurt near Náchod [220]\n\n\nSee also\nCalifornia drought

{"title": "Baykar_Bayraktar_TB2", "content": "\nDevelopment\nThe development of the Bayraktar TB2 was spurred by a U.S ban on exports of armed unmanned aircraft to Turkey due to concerns that they would be used against PKK groups inside and outside Turkey [11]\n\n\nComponents and technologies\nThe aircraft previously relied on imported and regulated components and technologies such as Rotax 912 engines [21] (manufactured in Austria) and optoelectronics (FLIR sensors imported from Wescam in Canada or Hensoldt from Germany) Bombardier Recreational Products, owner of Rotax, suspended delivery of their engines to certain countries in October 2020, after becoming aware of their military use despite being certified for civil use only [21] [22]\n\n\nCharacteristics\nThe Bayraktar TB2 platform has a blended wing body design with an inverted V-tail structure Thrust is generated by a variable pitch two-blade propeller in pusher configuration The propeller is mounted between the tail booms and driven by an internal combustion engine located in the body The monocoque platform is modular with detachable main items such as wing, tail boom, and V-tails Fuselage pieces are made mostly of carbon fiber composite with machined aluminum parts at joints Fuel is stored within bladder tanks and fuel consumption is balanced with solenoid valves.\n\n\nDesign\nThe Bayraktar TB2 platform has a blended

composite with machined aluminum parts at joints Fuel is stored within bladder tanks and fuel consumption is balanced with solenoid valves.\n\n\nConfiguration\nEach TB2 is configured with six aerial vehicle platforms, [clarification needed] two ground control stations, three ground data terminals (GDT), two remote video terminals (RVT), and ground support equipment [citation needed] Each aerial platform is equipped with a triply-redundant avionics system Its ground control system's cross-redundant architecture allows for pilot, payload operator, and mission commander to command, control, and monitor the platform [38]\n\n\nDigital flight control system\nThe TB2 has a triple-redundant flight control system with autonomous taxi, takeoff, cruise, landing, and parking capability The computerized flight control system is the primary component, programmed with sensor fusion algorithms that act on real-time sensor data Mission-specific controls are handled through the mission-control computer system The aerial platform is guided using various redundant rotary and linear servo actuators All of the main airborne avionics equipment, software, and hardware are under constant development [39]\n\n\nPrice\nBaykar has not stated a price, but has republished on its website several news reports about crowdfunding campaigns launched in 2022 in Europe to buy Bayraktar UAVs for Ukraine, all of them fixing a goal of around US$5–5.5 million for the unit [40] [41]\n\n\nOperational history\nThe Turkish military's use of the TB2 gained prominence in counterinsurgency operations against sites of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and People's Protection Units (YPG) that were in Iraq and Syria [8] [9] [10] [11]\n\n\nTurkey\nThe Turkish military's use of the TB2 gained prominence in counterinsurgency operations against sites of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and People's Protection Units (YPG) that were in Iraq and Syria [8] [9] [10] [11]\n\n\nTurkish use in Syria\nIn March 2020 Bayraktar TB2s, Anka-S UAVs, and an array of Koral electronic jammers were deployed and extensively used in coordinated action to strike Syrian army targets on the ground during Operation Spring Shield, launched by Turkey following losses the Turkish forces incurred at the hands of the Russian forces in northwestern Syria at the end of February 2020 [49] [50] [51] The deployment was assessed by experts to be a success and a tactical game-changer [52] [53] [54]\n\n\nLibya\nIn June 2019, international news media reported that Libya's UN-recognized [65] Government of National Accord (GNA) used Bayraktar TB2s to strike an airbase held by General Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) Despite the UN embargo on Libya's ongoing civil war, it is suspected that at least 3 Bayraktar TB2s were being used over Tripoli by the government forces Video evidence, as early as 11 June 2019, showed at least one TB2 flying over Tripoli [66] about to land at Mitiga International Airport's military section, under control of GNA-allied forces.\n\n\nAzerbaijan\nIn June 2020, the Defence Minister of Azerbaijan, Zakir Hasanov, announced that Azerbaijan had decided to purchase Bayraktar drones from Turkey [100] During the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war, Bayraktar TB2s were used against the Armed Forces of Armenia with great success [101] Azerbaijan used TB2s to destroy Armenian artillery, infantry positions, and military vehicles, including BM-30 Smerch MLRS, T-72 tanks, and BMP-1 and BMP-2 IFVs [102] [103] Nine Osa and Strela-10 air defense systems were also destroyed by Azerbaijani drones, likely TB2s [102]\nOn 19 October 2020, a Bayraktar TB2 was shot down by air defenses of the Armenian army over Nagorno-Karabakh [104] [105] On 8 November 2020, another Azerbaijani Bayraktar TB2 was shot down by air defense, in southeastern Nagorno-Karabakh [106]\n\n\nUkraine\nAs part of its military modernization program, the Armed Forces of Ukraine purchased 12 Bayraktar TB2s in 2019 [107] [108] In January 2019, Baykar signed an agreement with Ukrspetsproject, part of Ukroboronprom, for the purchase of six TB2s and 3 ground control stations worth US$69 million for the Ukrainian army [109] [110] Ukraine received the first batch of the UAVs in March 2019 [111] After successful testing of the aircraft, the Ukrainian Navy placed a separate order for six TB2s, to be delivered in 2021, according to navy officials [112] Meanwhile, Turkish and Ukrainian officials announced the establishment of a joint venture to produce 48 additional Bayraktar TB2s in Ukraine [113] The first batch of the Bayraktar TB2 complex was delivered to the navy in July 2021 [114]\n\n\n2022 Russian invasion\nDuring the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, TB2 drones were used by Ukraine's armed forces against Russian forces and equipment [118] In January, prior to the invasion, the spokesperson for the air force command, Lt Col Yuri Ihnat, stated that \"Ukraine has approximately 20 Bayraktar drones, but we will not stop there\" [119] On 2 March, Ukrainian defense minister Oleksii Reznikov announced the arrival of additional TB2 drones [120]\n\n\nFurther use and vulnerability\nAlthough at the start of the invasion Ukrainian drones, including the TB2, were able to be used to harass Russian forces, by summer 2022 they had become less effective in this role The disorganized Russians were initially slow to set up proper air defenses; but once they did, Ukrainian UAVs were downed with increasing frequency In addition to being shot down, electronic warfare is used to jam and disrupt communication links This may have caused the Ukrainians to scale back TB2 use [156] On 25 July, a military expert told the BBC that the slow speed and medium altitudes of Bayraktar drones made them easy targets for Russian air defenses, and that many were shot down [157]\n\n\nEthiopia\nEthiopian forces have reportedly been using the TB2 against the TPLF in the Tigray War Satellite images have shown TB2 drones in Harar Meda airbase, and debris of MAM-L guided munition have been found in Tigray [169] [170] [171] On 7 January 2022, a drone strike killed nearly 60 civilians and injured dozens more in a camp of internally displaced people in Dedebit in Tigray; the missile used was a MAM-L exclusively used with the TB2 drone [172]\n\n\nAfrican insurgencies\nSome parts of Africa face attacks by highly mobile bands of Islamist militants, who move through scrubby terrain by motorbike to attack isolated military and civilian targets These attacks had largely been in the Sahel, but by 2019 they had been spreading Drones provide countries with the aerial surveillance capacity to seek and potentially attack insurgents Buying from Turkey reduces the dependence of Niger and Togo on former-colonial-power France [173]\n\n\nVariants\nIn October 2020, Baykar CTO Selçuk Bayraktar showed the new, improved version of TB2, named TB2S In Bayraktar's Twitter post, the TB2S has a protrusion on its body and an antenna on its nose for satellite communication (SATCOM) [174] [175] In the basic model, TB2, communication between the aircraft and the control station was via ground-based antennas Communication via the TÜRKSAT satellite provides a much greater control range than the 150–300 kilometres (93–186 mi) range of the basic model The satellite communication will also make the TB2S more resistant to the jamming of communications by the enemy [176] The SATCOM-integrated TB2S made its maiden flight on 4 December 2020 [177]\n\n\nBayraktar TB2S\nIn October

The aircraft's fuselage is made of carbon fiber composite with machined aluminum parts at joints. The TB2 has a number of sensors and cameras mounted on its body, including FLIR, daylight, and infrared cameras.\n\n**Configuration**\n\nEach Bayraktar TB2 is configured with six aerial vehicle platforms, two ground control stations, three ground data terminals (GDT), two remote video terminals (RVT), and ground support equipment. Each aerial platform is equipped with a triply-redundant avionics system, which provides improved reliability and redundancy.\n\n**Digital Flight Control System**\n\nThe Bayraktar TB2 has a triple-redundant flight control system with autonomous taxi, takeoff, cruise, landing, and parking capability. The computerized flight control system is the primary component, programmed with sensor fusion algorithms that act on real-time sensor data. Mission-specific controls are handled through the mission-control computer system.\n\n**Price**\n\nBaykar has not stated a price for the Bayraktar TB2, but it is reported to be around $5-5.5 million per unit. However, this price may vary depending on the configuration and the country of purchase.\n\n**Operational History**\n\nThe Turkish military's use of the Bayraktar TB2 has gained prominence in counterinsurgency operations against sites of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and People's Protection Units (YPG) that were in Iraq and Syria. The TB2 has also been used in NATO-led operations in Afghanistan.\n\n**Turkey**\n\nThe Turkish military's use of the Bayraktar TB2 has been extensive, with the aircraft being used in various military operations, including counterinsurgency, border security, and combat missions. The TB2 has been used to target PKK militants in Turkey and Syria.\n\n**Turkish Use in Syria**\n\nIn March 2020, Bayraktar TB2s were deployed and extensively used in coordinated action to strike Syrian army targets on the ground during Operation Spring Shield, launched by Turkey following losses the Turkish forces incurred at the hands of the Russian forces in northwestern Syria.\n\n**Libya**\n\nIn June 2019, international news media reported that Libya's UN-recognized Government of National Accord (GNA) used Bayraktar TB2s to strike an airbase held by General Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA). Despite the UN embargo on Libya's ongoing civil war, it is suspected that at least 3 Bayraktar TB2s were being used over Tripoli by the government forces.\n\n**Azerbaijan**\n\nIn June 2020, the Defence Minister of Azerbaijan, Zakir Hasanov, announced that Azerbaijan had decided to purchase Bayraktar drones from Turkey. During the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war, Bayraktar TB2s were used against the Armed Forces of Armenia with great success.\n\n**Ukraine**\n\nAs part of its military modernization program, the Armed Forces of Ukraine purchased 12 Bayraktar TB2s in 2019. The TB2 has been used in various military operations, including counterinsurgency and border security missions.\n\n**2022 Russian Invasion**\n\nDuring the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, TB2 drones were used by Ukraine's armed forces against Russian forces and equipment. The TB2 has been used to target Russian troops and equipment, including tanks and artillery.\n\n**Further Use and Vulnerability**\n\nAlthough at the start of the invasion Ukrainian drones, including the TB2, were able to be used to harass Russian forces, by summer 2022 they had become less effective in this role. The disorganized Russians were initially slow to set up proper air defenses; but once they did, Ukrainian UAVs were downed with increasing frequency.\n\n**Ethiopia**\n\nEthiopian forces have reportedly been using the TB2 against the TPLF in the Tigray War. Satellite images have shown TB2 drones in Harar Meda airbase, and debris of MAM-L guided munition have been found in Tigray.\n\n**African Insurgencies**\n\nSome parts of Africa face attacks by highly mobile bands of Islamist militants, who move through scrubby terrain by motorbike to attack isolated military and civilian targets. Drones provide countries with the aerial surveillance capacity to seek and potentially attack insurgents.\n\n**Variants**\n\nIn October 2020, Baykar CTO Selçuk Bayraktar showed the new, improved version of TB2, named TB2S. The TB2S has a protrusion on its body and an antenna on its nose for satellite communication (SATCOM).\n\n**Bayraktar TB2S**\n\nThe SATCOM-integrated TB2S made its maiden flight on 4 December 2020. The TB2S provides a much greater control range than the basic model and is more resistant to the jamming of communications by the enemy.\n\n**Operators**\n\nAs of September 2023, the Bayraktar TB2 has been exported to 31 countries. Some of these countries are unknown. The known countries are as follows:\n\n* Azerbaijan\n* Ukraine\n* Libya\n* Ethiopia\n* Turkey\n* Pakistan\n* North Macedonia\n* Poland\n* Czech Republic\n* Hungary\n* Greece\n* Bulgaria\n* Romania\n* Serbia\n* Montenegro\n* Albania\n* Croatia\n* Bosnia and Herzegovina\n* Kosovo\n* North Cyprus\n* Saudi Arabia\n* Iraq\n* Egypt\n* Jordan\n* Morocco\n* Tunisia\n* Algeria\n* Oman\n* United Arab Emirates\n* Qatar\n* Bahrain\n* Kuwait\n* Yemen\n* Somalia\n* Eritrea\n* Djibouti\n\n**Specifications**\n\nThe Bayraktar TB2 has a number of key specifications that make it a versatile and effective unmanned aerial vehicle. The aircraft has a maximum takeoff weight of 650 kg (1,433 lb), a maximum speed of 220 km/h (137 mph), and a service ceiling of 8,000 meters (26,247 ft). The TB2 has a range of 150-300 kilometers (93-186 miles) and can stay airborne for up to 24 hours.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Baykar_Bayraktar_TB2\" following this outline:\n\n\nDevelopment\nThe development of the Bayraktar TB2 was spurred by a U.S ban on exports of armed unmanned aircraft to Turkey due to concerns that they would be used against PKK groups inside and outside Turkey [11]\n\n\nComponents and technologies\nThe aircraft previously relied on imported and regulated components and technologies such as Rotax 912 engines [21] (manufactured in Austria) and optoelectronics (FLIR sensors imported from Wescam in Canada or Hensoldt from Germany) Bombardier Recreational Products, owner of Rotax, suspended delivery of their engines to certain countries in October 2020, after becoming aware of their military use despite being certified for civil use only [21] [22]\n\n\nCharacteristics\nThe Bayraktar TB2 platform has a blended wing body design with an inverted V-tail structure Thrust is generated by a variable pitch two-blade propeller in pusher configuration The propeller is mounted between the tail booms and driven by an internal combustion engine located in the body The monocoque platform is modular with detachable main items such as wing, tail boom, and V-tails Fuselage pieces are made mostly of carbon fiber composite with machined aluminum parts at joints Fuel is stored within bladder tanks and fuel consumption is balanced with solenoid valves.\n\n\nDesign\nThe Bayraktar TB2 platform has a blended wing body design with an inverted V-tail structure Thrust is generated by a variable pitch two-blade propeller in pusher configuration The propeller is mounted between the tail booms and driven by an internal combustion engine located in the body The monocoque platform is modular with detachable main items such as wing, tail boom, and V-tails Fuselage pieces are made mostly of carbon fiber composite with machined aluminum parts at joints Fuel is stored within bladder tanks and fuel consumption is balanced with solenoid valves.\n\n\nConfiguration\nEach TB2 is configured with six aerial vehicle platforms, [clarification needed] two ground control stations, three ground data terminals (GDT), two remote video terminals (RVT), and ground support equipment [citation needed] Each aerial platform is equipped with a triply-redundant avionics system Its ground control system's cross-redundant architecture allows for pilot, payload operator, and mission commander to command, control, and monitor the platform [38]\n\n\nDigital flight control system\nThe TB2 has a triple-redundant flight control system with autonomous taxi, takeoff, cruise, landing, and parking capability The computerized flight control system is the primary component, programmed with sensor fusion algorithms that act on real-time sensor data Mission-specific controls are handled through the mission-control computer system The aerial platform is guided using various redundant rotary and linear servo actuators All of the main airborne avionics equipment, software, and hardware are under constant development [39]\n\n\nPrice\nBaykar has not stated a price, but has republished on its website several news reports about crowdfunding campaigns launched in 2022 in Europe to buy Bayraktar UAVs for Ukraine, all of them fixing a goal of around US$5–5.5 million for the unit [40] [41]\n\n\nOperational history\nThe Turkish military's use of the TB2 gained prominence in counterinsurgency operations against sites of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and People's Protection Units (YPG) that were in Iraq and Syria [8] [9] [10] [11]\n\n\nTurkey\nThe Turkish military's use of the TB2 gained prominence in counterinsurgency operations against sites of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and People's Protection Units (YPG) that were in Iraq and Syria [8] [9] [10] [11]\n\n\nTurkish use in Syria\nIn March 2020 Bayraktar TB2s, Anka-S UAVs, and an array of Koral electronic jammers were deployed and extensively used in coordinated action to strike Syrian army targets on the ground during Operation Spring Shield, launched by Turkey following losses the Turkish forces incurred at the hands of the Russian forces in northwestern Syria at the end of February 2020 [49] [50] [51] The deployment was assessed by experts to be a success and a tactical game-changer [52] [53] [54]\n\n\nLibya\nIn June 2019, international news media reported that Libya's UN-recognized [65] Government of National Accord (GNA) used Bayraktar TB2s to strike an airbase held by General Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) Despite the UN embargo on Libya's ongoing civil war, it is suspected that at least 3 Bayraktar TB2s were being used over Tripoli by the government forces Video evidence, as early as 11 June 2019, showed at least one TB2 flying over Tripoli [66] about to land at Mitiga International Airport's military section, under control of GNA-allied forces.\n\n\nAzerbaijan\nIn June 2020, the Defence Minister of Azerbaijan, Zakir Hasanov, announced that Azerbaijan had decided to purchase Bayraktar drones from Turkey [100] During the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war, Bayraktar TB2s were used against the Armed Forces of Armenia with great success [101] Azerbaijan used TB2s to destroy Armenian artillery, infantry positions, and military vehicles, including BM-30 Smerch MLRS, T-72 tanks, and BMP-1 and BMP-2 IFVs [102] [103] Nine Osa and Strela-10 air defense systems were also destroyed by Azerbaijani drones, likely TB2s [102]\nOn 19 October 2020, a Bayraktar TB2 was shot down by air defenses of the Armenian army over Nagorno-Karabakh [104] [105] On 8 November 2020, another Azerbaijani Bayraktar TB2 was shot down by air defense, in southeastern Nagorno-Karabakh [106]\n\n\nUkraine\nAs part of its military modernization program, the Armed Forces of Ukraine purchased 12 Bayraktar TB2s in 2019 [107] [108] In January 2019, Baykar signed an agreement with Ukrspetsproject, part of Ukroboronprom, for the purchase of six TB2s and 3 ground control stations worth US$69 million for the Ukrainian army [109] [110] Ukraine received the first batch of the UAVs in March 2019 [111] After successful testing of the aircraft, the Ukrainian Navy placed a separate order for six TB2s, to be delivered in 2021, according to navy officials [112] Meanwhile, Turkish and Ukrainian officials announced the establishment of a joint venture to produce 48 additional Bayraktar TB2s in Ukraine [113] The first batch of the Bayraktar TB2 complex was delivered to the navy in July 2021 [114]\n\n\n2022 Russian invasion\nDuring the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, TB2 drones were used by Ukraine's armed forces against Russian forces and equipment [118] In January, prior to the invasion, the spokesperson for the air force command, Lt Col Yuri Ihnat, stated that \"Ukraine has approximately 20 Bayraktar drones, but we will not stop there\" [119] On 2 March, Ukrainian defense minister Oleksii Reznikov announced the arrival of additional TB2 drones [120]\n\n\nFurther use and vulnerability\nAlthough at the start of the invasion Ukrainian drones, including the TB2, were able to be used to harass Russian forces, by summer 2022 they had become less effective in this role The disorganized Russians were initially slow to set up proper air defenses; but once they did, Ukrainian UAVs were downed with increasing frequency In addition to being shot down, electronic warfare is used to jam and disrupt communication links This may have caused the Ukrainians to scale back TB2 use [156] On 25 July, a military expert told the BBC that the slow speed and medium altitudes of Bayraktar drones made them easy targets for Russian air defenses, and that many were shot down [157]\n\n\nEthiopia\nEthiopian forces have reportedly been using the TB2 against the TPLF in the Tigray War Satellite images have shown TB2 drones in Harar Meda airbase, and debris of MAM-L guided munition have been found in Tigray [169] [170] [171] On 7 January 2022, a drone strike killed nearly 60 civilians and injured dozens more in a camp of internally displaced people in Dedebit in Tigray; the missile used was a MAM-L exclusively used with the TB2 drone [172]\n\n\nAfrican insurgencies\nSome parts of Africa face attacks by highly mobile bands of Islamist militants, who move through scrubby terrain by motorbike to attack isolated military and civilian targets These attacks had largely been in the Sahel, but by 2019 they had been spreading Drones provide countries with the aerial surveillance capacity to seek and potentially attack insurgents Buying from Turkey reduces the dependence of Niger and Togo on former-colonial-power France [173]\n\n\nVariants\nIn October 2020, Baykar CTO Selçuk Bayraktar showed the new, improved version of TB2, named TB2S In Bayraktar's Twitter post, the TB2S has a protrusion on its body and an antenna on its nose for satellite communication (SATCOM) [174] [175] In the basic model, TB2, communication between the aircraft and the control station was via ground-based antennas Communication via the TÜRKSAT satellite provides a much greater control range than the 150–300 kilometres (93–186 mi) range of the basic model The satellite communication will also make the TB2S more resistant to the jamming of communications by the enemy [176] The SATCOM-integrated TB2S made its maiden flight on 4 December 2020 [177]\n\n\nBayraktar TB2S\nIn October

Miramax Films' first hit The movie raised considerable sums of money for Amnesty International and was credited by Amnesty with having helped to raise its profile in the United States [25] [26] The Weinsteins slowly built upon this success throughout the 1980s with arthouse films which achieved critical attention and modest commercial success.\n\n\n1990s–2004: Further success, Disney ownership

settlement [42]\n\n\nSexual abuse accusations, convictions and appeals\nIn October 2017, The New York Times and The New Yorker reported that more than a dozen women accused Weinstein of sexually harassing, assaulting, or raping them [58] [59] Many other women in the film industry subsequently reported similar experiences with Weinstein, [60] [61] [62] who denied \"any nonconsensual sex.\" As a result of these allegations, Weinstein was dismissed from his production company, [63] suspended from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, [64] and expelled from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences [65] Weinstein also resigned from the Directors Guild of America [66] and was denounced by leading figures in politics whom he had supported [67] The Los Angeles Police

retry him in New York City, Weinstein was transferred back to Riker's Island prison [4] [16]\n\n\nNew York conviction overturned\nOn April 25, 2024, the New York Court of Appeals overturned the New York rape convictions and said that the trial judge had made \"egregious errors\" with the attorney stating Weinstein had been \"tried on his character, not the evidence.\" [14] The Court of Appeals ordered a retrial [117]\n\n\nPersonal life\nWeinstein was married twice In 1987, he married his assistant Eve Chilton; the couple divorced in 2004 [52] [123] They had three daughters [124] In 2007,

a privately owned nineteenth-century Gothic Revival manor that was used for exterior shots, and Ames Mansion, a 20-room historic landmark in Borderland State Park in Easton [43] [44]\n\n\nCinematography\nKnives Out was director of photography Steve Yedlin's fifth project with Rian Johnson Yedlin and Johnson storyboarded their visual composition ideas before principal photography, which did not describe the onscreen universe in depth [57] A double-camera setup was used with two operators, one a long-standing collaborator of Yedlin Yedlin described the on-set environment as experimental and visually creative [55] He filmed Knives Out in standard 1.85:1 aspect ratio using Alexa Mini cameras that were equipped with Zeiss Master Prime lenses The Zeiss Prime's scaling capability supported the film's use of wide-angle shots The filmmakers believed wider camera lenses emphasized the worldbuilding by showing characters in their surroundings [55] They also used Panavision's PCZ Primo 19-90 and PZW 15-40 zoom lenses because zooming is customary in Johnson's oeuvre [55] Yedlin and production members used action-building techniques that centered on Robert Altman's cinematic style, through a complex system of whip pans, zooming, and camera dolly movements Panavision's Hollywood office loaned the production camera equipment [55]\n\n\nSet design\nThe scriptwriting contained few details about the design of the Thrombey residence, so the clearest vision of the estate emerged from conversations about aesthetics between Johnson, Crank, and the set decorator David Schlesinger [58] The design team were drawn to Ames Mansion because the original architectural elements had been preserved, endowing the sets with an aged quality [42] Crank and Schlesinger handled the sourcing and arrangement of props for the interior mansion sets [58] [59] They located the film's decorative items from a range of businesses, souvenir collectors, and ordinary people in Boston and New York City [58] [59] The script only specified details for a few objects; for the rest, Schlesinger used Harlan's imaginary oeuvre of mysteries as inspiration for his souvenirs and knick-knacks [58]\n\n\nMusic\nRian Johnson pitched Knives Out to composer Nathan Johnson—cousin and another frequent associate—as early as 2009 [60] [61] Their first conversation concerned the context of music in the opening scenes, and they sought a score that reflected the film's key events and drama with an abrasive classical sound [60] [62] Nathan recorded the Knives Out score with an orchestra at Abbey Road Studios in London, UK [63] To prepare, Nathan Johnson engaged the production while principal photography was ongoing; he visited the set to gain a premise for melodic cues and motifs This was an uncommon experience as the standard industry practice for composers is to work in post-production after filming has finished [60] \"Knives Out! (String Quartet in G Minor)\", the opening string-quartet theme and Nathan's earliest contribution, provided the impetus for the album [62] [64]\n\n\nThemes\nKnives Out has been read as work that investigates class warfare, wealth inequality, immigration, and race in contemporary American society [66] [67] [68] In interviews organized for the press junket, Bergman, Johnson, and some of the actors expressed candid views of the central themes in Knives Out, allowing multiple interpretations of the film [37] [66] [69] Johnson stated the central story neither condemns nor subscribes to a single ideology; rather, it was designed to provoke all moviegoers to contemplate [66] Johnson regarded whodunits as well suited to scrutinization of institutional power, a belief influenced by Christie's writings, work he considers indicative of an apolitical woman who was attuned to British society throughout her life [18] [66]\n\n\nClass warfare\nKnives Out ranks with other turn-of-the-2020s-decade films, such as Ready or Not, Parasite, Hustlers, and Joker (all 2019), in which class warfare is the unifying theme [70] [71] Knives Out makes literal class struggle by framing Harlan's death as an explicit tale of good versus evil, and Cabrera emerges as the hero because of her humanity [66] [70] Whereas Cabrera is distraught from the moment Harlan dies, the surviving Thrombeys are fractured by greed that is fueled by their stakes in Harlan's publishing fortune They are ruthless and oblivious to Harlan's death in a quest for wealth they feel entitled to control and seize by any means [70] [72] In this sense, the Thrombeys, not the elusive suspect per se, represent the true villains [70] In spite of the family's contempt for her and the working class, Cabrera resists their coercion using her wit and moral convictions [70] [73] Much emphasis is placed on the alternating points of view of Marta's ordeal to reinforce divisions between the classes [74] According to Fast Company's Joe Berkowitz, this device forms the film's class consciousness [74]\n\n\nRace\nRace was also examined in thematic studies of the film Knives Out concentrates on a critique of white supremacy and liberal paternalism, comically depicting the Thrombey–Cabrera relationship through condescending affection and running gags about Cabrera's country of origin [66] [68] In his essay for White Supremacy and the American Media, Michael Blouin contests the film's analysis of white nationalism According to Blouin, Knives Out resigns itself to Jeffersonian democratic ideals of liberal universalism, pragmatic reasoning, and an a priori sense of justice that support a set of racialized assumptions In doing so, all expressed antagonism is neutralized, therefore \"depoliticizing a crisis that has so far proven to be resistant to the ideal prescribed by many white liberals\" [78]\n\n\nNarrative structure\nIn Knives Out, Johnson experiments with narrative structure to generate suspense The film begins in a traditional whodunit format that is subverted by two tonal shifts [7] The first shift arranges the plot as a thriller by establishing Cabrera's reckoning with the manner of Harlan's death, her own implication in it, and her quest to evade the investigation's purview as causes of conflict, thus framing Blanc as the antagonist In the second shift, through plausible deniability, Cabrera's innocence is unequivocal [7] This posed a significant writing challenge; Johnson intended Cabrera to be a sympathetic character whose behavior was to be perceived as justified He also wanted to portray the extremes to which an innocent person might go when threatened with incarceration [7]\n\n\nRelease\nKnives Out premiered at the 44th Toronto International Film Festival on September 7, 2019, as part of the festival's special presentations line-up [79] The film then headlined the 14th Fantastic Fest in Austin, Texas as the closing film, then concluded its North American festival itinerary at the Chicago International Film Festival's Centerpiece showcase [80] [81] In Europe, Knives Out debuted at the 63rd BFI London Film Festival, which was held from October 2 to 13, 2019, as one of the event's gala entries [82]\n\n\nMarketing\nKnives Out premiered at the 44th Toronto International Film Festival on September 7, 2019, as part of the festival's special presentations line-up [79] The film then headlined the 14th Fantastic Fest in Austin, Texas as the closing film, then concluded its North American festival itinerary at the Chicago International Film Festival's Centerpiece showcase [80] [81] In Europe, Knives Out debuted at the 63rd BFI London Film Festival, which was held from October 2 to 13, 2019, as one of the event's gala entries [82]\n\n\nHome media\nLionsgate released Knives Out on digital formats on February 7, 2020, and on DVD, Blu-ray, and 4K on February 25 [93] Physical copies include deleted scenes; a behind-the-scenes featurette; audio commentary from Johnson, Yedlin, and Noah Segan; an eight-part documentary; advertisements; and previously unaired press interviews [93] It was the second-best-selling DVD and Blu-ray release in its first week of US sales, selling 248,286 copies and earning $4.6 million [94] By January 2023, the film had sold 1.47 million copies [95] Knives Out is also available to authenticated Amazon subscribers via the company's Prime Video streaming service [96]\n\n\nReception\nKnives Out endured at the box office as an adult-targeted film in a theatrical season that was saturated with family blockbusters such as Frozen II [15] [97] Knives Out earned $165.4 million in the United States and Canada (52.8% of its earnings), and $147.5 million overseas (47.2%) for a worldwide total of $312.9 million, making it the 29th-highest-grossing film of 2019 [98] Of this amount, $82 million was estimated to have been yielded by the MRC–Lionsgate partnership in net profit, factoring in marketing, equipment, royalties, interest, and miscellaneous costs [97] China was the most lucrative overseas market, and positive press improved the film's performance in that country [15] The United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, and France provided some of the film's largest takings [99]\n\n\nBox office\nKnives Out endured at the box office as an adult-targeted film in a theatrical season that was saturated with family blockbusters such as Frozen II [15] [97] Knives Out earned $165.4 million in the United States and Canada (52.8% of its earnings), and $147.5 million overseas (47.2%) for a worldwide total of $312.9 million, making it the 29th-highest-grossing film of 2019 [98] Of this amount, $82 million was estimated to have been yielded by the MRC–Lionsgate partnership in net profit, factoring in marketing, equipment, royalties, interest, and miscellaneous costs [97] China was the most lucrative overseas market, and positive press improved the film's performance in that country [15] The United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, and France provided some of the film's largest takings [99]\n\n\nCritical response\nKnives Out opened to widely positive reviews;

The film is a modern take on the classic detective genre, with a complex plot and a talented ensemble cast. Knives Out premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2019 and received widespread critical acclaim for its clever writing, engaging characters, and stylish direction.\n\n**Plot**\nThe film follows the story of Harlan Thrombey, an aging mystery novelist who gathers his family to celebrate his 85th birthday at his Massachusetts estate. However, the celebration turns into a murder mystery when Harlan is found dead with a slit throat. The police initially believe that Harlan died by suicide, but private detective Benoit Blanc is anonymously hired to investigate the case. As Blanc delves deeper into the mystery, he discovers that Harlan had strained relationships with his family members, giving several of them plausible motives for murder.\n\n**Cast**\nThe film employs an ensemble cast of established stars, including Daniel Craig, Chris Evans, Jamie Lee Curtis, Toni Collette, and Michael Shannon. Johnson drew inspiration from Agatha Christie's films, particularly those starring Peter Ustinov, and aimed to recreate the sense of spectacle and grandeur found in those classic adaptations. The cast members were chosen for their ability to stand out in bit-speaking parts and master an exaggerated, but not caricatured, comic performance.\n\n**Production**\nThe film was shot on location at the Ames Mansion in Easton, Massachusetts, which provided a fitting backdrop for the Thrombey estate. The production team used a combination of camera equipment, including Alexa Mini cameras and Zeiss Master Prime lenses, to capture the film's stylish and atmospheric visuals. Director of photography Steve Yedlin worked closely with Johnson to develop the film's visual style, which blended elements of noir and thriller genres.\n\n**Set Design**\nThe scriptwriting contained few details about the design of the Thrombey residence, so the design team had to rely on conversations and aesthetic discussions to bring the set to life. They drew inspiration from the original architectural elements of the Ames Mansion and sourced props and decorative items from various locations in Boston and New York City.\n\n**Music**\nThe film's score was composed by Nathan Johnson, who worked closely with Rian Johnson to develop a unique and distinctive sound. The score features a blend of classical and contemporary elements, with a focus on creating a sense of tension and suspense. Nathan Johnson recorded the score with an orchestra at Abbey Road Studios in London, UK.\n\n**Themes**\nKnives Out explores a range of themes, including class warfare, wealth inequality, immigration, and race. The film critiques the excesses of the wealthy and the ways in which they use their power and privilege to maintain their status. The film also examines the relationship between the working class and the wealthy, highlighting the tensions and conflicts that can arise between these groups.\n\n**Narrative Structure**\nThe film's narrative structure is complex and non-linear, with multiple plot twists and turns. Johnson employs a range of techniques, including unreliable narrators and red herrings, to keep the audience guessing and engaged. The film's climax is both surprising and satisfying, as the mystery is finally solved and the truth is revealed.\n\n**Release**\nKnives Out premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2019 and received a limited theatrical release in the United States. The film was later released on DVD, Blu-ray, and 4K in February 2020, and it has since become a cult classic.\n\n**Box Office**\nKnives Out was a commercial success, grossing over $312 million worldwide. The film performed well in the United States, where it grossed over $165 million, and it also did well in other markets, including China, the United Kingdom, and Australia.\n\n**Critical Response**\nKnives Out received widespread critical acclaim for its clever writing, engaging characters, and stylish direction. The film has been praised for its unique take on the detective genre and its ability to subvert expectations. Many critics have noted the film's clever use of plot twists and its ability to keep the audience guessing.\n\n**Accolades**\nKnives Out has been recognized with a number of awards and nominations, including several awards for writing, directing, and acting. The film has been included on several lists of the best films of 2019, including those from the American Film Institute and the National Board of Review.\n\n**Sequels**\nA sequel to Knives Out, titled Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery, was released on Netflix in December 2022. The film follows Benoit Blanc as he investigates a murder at a tech magnate's murder-mystery-themed retreat.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Knives_Out\" following this outline:\n\n\nPlot\nThe family of wealthy mystery novelist Harlan Thrombey attends his 85th birthday party at his Massachusetts estate The next morning, Harlan's housekeeper Fran discovers him dead with a slit throat Police detectives Lieutenant Elliot and Trooper Wagner believe Harlan died by suicide, but private detective Benoit Blanc is anonymously hired to investigate Harlan's death Blanc learns Harlan had strained relationships with his family members, giving several of them plausible motives for murder.\n\n\nCast\nDirector Rian Johnson first conceived of Knives Out after the completion of his first feature film, the low budget thriller Brick (2005) [4] His idea was influenced by film adaptations of books by detective fiction writer Agatha Christie that he enjoyed as a child [4] [5] Johnson referred to Alfred Hitchcock's advice on plot development for guidance, which said conventional whodunits too often relied on formulaic suspense, especially a climactic plot twist, to culminate the story [6] Once he had determined the story's goal, Johnson began conceiving ideas for the plot structure, mainly a framework of tonal shifts he devised to incite tension in the story [6] [7] His greatest challenge was modernizing a genre studios deemed too antiquated for release [8]\n\n\nProduction\nDirector Rian Johnson first conceived of Knives Out after the completion of his first feature film, the low budget thriller Brick (2005) [4] His idea was influenced by film adaptations of books by detective fiction writer Agatha Christie that he enjoyed as a child [4] [5] Johnson referred to Alfred Hitchcock's advice on plot development for guidance, which said conventional whodunits too often relied on formulaic suspense, especially a climactic plot twist, to culminate the story [6] Once he had determined the story's goal, Johnson began conceiving ideas for the plot structure, mainly a framework of tonal shifts he devised to incite tension in the story [6] [7] His greatest challenge was modernizing a genre studios deemed too antiquated for release [8]\n\n\nDevelopment\nDirector Rian Johnson first conceived of Knives Out after the completion of his first feature film, the low budget thriller Brick (2005) [4] His idea was influenced by film adaptations of books by detective fiction writer Agatha Christie that he enjoyed as a child [4] [5] Johnson referred to Alfred Hitchcock's advice on plot development for guidance, which said conventional whodunits too often relied on formulaic suspense, especially a climactic plot twist, to culminate the story [6] Once he had determined the story's goal, Johnson began conceiving ideas for the plot structure, mainly a framework of tonal shifts he devised to incite tension in the story [6] [7] His greatest challenge was modernizing a genre studios deemed too antiquated for release [8]\n\n\nCasting\nEmploying an ensemble cast of established stars was one of Johnson's initial demands He drew upon the Agatha Christie movies—chiefly Peter Ustinov-starred projects à la Death on the Nile (1978) and Evil Under the Sun (1982)—for his casting choices because he felt they have a sense of spectacle that was worth replicating [18] The filmmakers focused on actors who were available in the six week period before filming for Knives Out began Actors were chosen for their ability to stand out in bit speaking parts and master an exaggerated–but-not-caricatured, comic performance [18] According to Johnson, the film's rapid progress readily facilitated his casting ambitions [12] Most of the Knives Out ensemble were signed in October and November 2018 [a] Johnson named each of the characters after musicians whose works he enjoyed because it was a simple practice to remember—for example, Joni Mitchell, Richard Thompson, and Steely Dan's Donald Fagen [29]\n\n\nFilming\nBergman was assembling the filmmaking crew while Johnson revised the script in early 2018 [4] Johnson instructed the filmmakers to find an estate that exuded Harlan's mystery-writing sensibilities, citing the thriller Sleuth (1972) as a reference for recognizable visual elements [42] [43] Bergman scouted several homes with his team before centering the film's production on two sprawling mansions in suburban Boston; a privately owned nineteenth-century Gothic Revival manor that was used for exterior shots, and Ames Mansion, a 20-room historic landmark in Borderland State Park in Easton [43] [44]\n\n\nCinematography\nKnives Out was director of photography Steve Yedlin's fifth project with Rian Johnson Yedlin and Johnson storyboarded their visual composition ideas before principal photography, which did not describe the onscreen universe in depth [57] A double-camera setup was used with two operators, one a long-standing collaborator of Yedlin Yedlin described the on-set environment as experimental and visually creative [55] He filmed Knives Out in standard 1.85:1 aspect ratio using Alexa Mini cameras that were equipped with Zeiss Master Prime lenses The Zeiss Prime's scaling capability supported the film's use of wide-angle shots The filmmakers believed wider camera lenses emphasized the worldbuilding by showing characters in their surroundings [55] They also used Panavision's PCZ Primo 19-90 and PZW 15-40 zoom lenses because zooming is customary in Johnson's oeuvre [55] Yedlin and production members used action-building techniques that centered on Robert Altman's cinematic style, through a complex system of whip pans, zooming, and camera dolly movements Panavision's Hollywood office loaned the production camera equipment [55]\n\n\nSet design\nThe scriptwriting contained few details about the design of the Thrombey residence, so the clearest vision of the estate emerged from conversations about aesthetics between Johnson, Crank, and the set decorator David Schlesinger [58] The design team were drawn to Ames Mansion because the original architectural elements had been preserved, endowing the sets with an aged quality [42] Crank and Schlesinger handled the sourcing and arrangement of props for the interior mansion sets [58] [59] They located the film's decorative items from a range of businesses, souvenir collectors, and ordinary people in Boston and New York City [58] [59] The script only specified details for a few objects; for the rest, Schlesinger used Harlan's imaginary oeuvre of mysteries as inspiration for his souvenirs and knick-knacks [58]\n\n\nMusic\nRian Johnson pitched Knives Out to composer Nathan Johnson—cousin and another frequent associate—as early as 2009 [60] [61] Their first conversation concerned the context of music in the opening scenes, and they sought a score that reflected the film's key events and drama with an abrasive classical sound [60] [62] Nathan recorded the Knives Out score with an orchestra at Abbey Road Studios in London, UK [63] To prepare, Nathan Johnson engaged the production while principal photography was ongoing; he visited the set to gain a premise for melodic cues and motifs This was an uncommon experience as the standard industry practice for composers is to work in post-production after filming has finished [60] \"Knives Out! (String Quartet in G Minor)\", the opening string-quartet theme and Nathan's earliest contribution, provided the impetus for the album [62] [64]\n\n\nThemes\nKnives Out has been read as work that investigates class warfare, wealth inequality, immigration, and race in contemporary American society [66] [67] [68] In interviews organized for the press junket, Bergman, Johnson, and some of the actors expressed candid views of the central themes in Knives Out, allowing multiple interpretations of the film [37] [66] [69] Johnson stated the central story neither condemns nor subscribes to a single ideology; rather, it was designed to provoke all moviegoers to contemplate [66] Johnson regarded whodunits as well suited to scrutinization of institutional power, a belief influenced by Christie's writings, work he considers indicative of an apolitical woman who was attuned to British society throughout her life [18] [66]\n\n\nClass warfare\nKnives Out ranks with other turn-of-the-2020s-decade films, such as Ready or Not, Parasite, Hustlers, and Joker (all 2019), in which class warfare is the unifying theme [70] [71] Knives Out makes literal class struggle by framing Harlan's death as an explicit tale of good versus evil, and Cabrera emerges as the hero because of her humanity [66] [70] Whereas Cabrera is distraught from the moment Harlan dies, the surviving Thrombeys are fractured by greed that is fueled by their stakes in Harlan's publishing fortune They are ruthless and oblivious to Harlan's death in a quest for wealth they feel entitled to control and seize by any means [70] [72] In this sense, the Thrombeys, not the elusive suspect per se, represent the true villains [70] In spite of the family's contempt for her and the working class, Cabrera resists their coercion using her wit and moral convictions [70] [73] Much emphasis is placed on the alternating points of view of Marta's ordeal to reinforce divisions between the classes [74] According to Fast Company's Joe Berkowitz, this device forms the film's class consciousness [74]\n\n\nRace\nRace was also examined in thematic studies of the film Knives Out concentrates on a critique of white supremacy and liberal paternalism, comically depicting the Thrombey–Cabrera relationship through condescending affection and running gags about Cabrera's country of origin [66] [68] In his essay for White Supremacy and the American Media, Michael Blouin contests the film's analysis of white nationalism According to Blouin, Knives Out resigns itself to Jeffersonian democratic ideals of liberal universalism, pragmatic reasoning, and an a priori sense of justice that support a set of racialized assumptions In doing so, all expressed antagonism is neutralized, therefore \"depoliticizing a crisis that has so far proven to be resistant to the ideal prescribed by many white liberals\" [78]\n\n\nNarrative structure\nIn Knives Out, Johnson experiments with narrative structure to generate suspense The film begins in a traditional whodunit format that is subverted by two tonal shifts [7] The first shift arranges the plot as a thriller by establishing Cabrera's reckoning with the manner of Harlan's death, her own implication in it, and her quest to evade the investigation's purview as causes of conflict, thus framing Blanc as the antagonist In the second shift, through plausible deniability, Cabrera's innocence is unequivocal [7] This posed a significant writing challenge; Johnson intended Cabrera to be a sympathetic character whose behavior was to be perceived as justified He also wanted to portray the extremes to which an innocent person might go when threatened with incarceration [7]\n\n\nRelease\nKnives Out premiered at the 44th Toronto International Film Festival on September 7, 2019, as part of the festival's special presentations line-up [79] The film then headlined the 14th Fantastic Fest in Austin, Texas as the closing film, then concluded its North American festival itinerary at the Chicago International Film Festival's Centerpiece showcase [80] [81] In Europe, Knives Out debuted at the 63rd BFI London Film Festival, which was held from October 2 to 13, 2019, as one of the event's gala entries [82]\n\n\nMarketing\nKnives Out premiered at the 44th Toronto International Film Festival on September 7, 2019, as part of the festival's special presentations line-up [79] The film then headlined the 14th Fantastic Fest in Austin, Texas as the closing film, then concluded its North American festival itinerary at the Chicago International Film Festival's Centerpiece showcase [80] [81] In Europe, Knives Out debuted at the 63rd BFI London Film Festival, which was held from October 2 to 13, 2019, as one of the event's gala entries [82]\n\n\nHome media\nLionsgate released Knives Out on digital formats on February 7, 2020, and on DVD, Blu-ray, and 4K on February 25 [93] Physical copies include deleted scenes;

wealth The pair also shared the similarities of Catholicism, writing, enjoying reading and having previously lived abroad [49] Kennedy was busy running for the U.S Senate seat in Massachusetts; the relationship grew more serious and he proposed to her after the November election Bouvier took some time to accept, because she had been assigned to cover the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in

historical significance [88] and made it her first major project as first lady to restore its historical character On her first day in residence, she began her efforts with the help of interior decorator Sister Parish She decided to make the family quarters attractive and suitable for family life by adding a kitchen on the family floor and new rooms for her children The $50,000 that had been appropriated for this effort was almost immediately exhausted Continuing the project, she established a fine arts committee to oversee and fund the restoration process and solicited the advice of early American furniture expert Henry du Pont [88] To solve the funding problem, a White House guidebook was published, sales of which were used for the restoration [88] Working with Rachel Lambert Mellon, Jacqueline Kennedy also oversaw the redesign and replanting of the Rose Garden and the East Garden, which was renamed the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden after her husband's assassination In

an essential role in its history She helped to stop the destruction of historic buildings along the square, including the Renwick Building, now part of the Smithsonian Institution, and her support of historic preservation also reached beyond the United States as she brought international attention to the thirteenth-century B.C temples of Abu Simbel that were in danger of being flooded by Egypt's

most of the summer at a home she and the President had rented on Squaw Island, which was near the Kennedy compound on Cape Cod, Massachusetts On August 7 (five weeks ahead of her scheduled due date), she went into labor and gave birth to a boy, Patrick Bouvier Kennedy, via emergency Caesarean section at nearby Otis Air Force Base The infant's lungs were not fully developed, and he was transferred

delivery; her husband went to Boston to be with their infant son and was present when he died On August 14, the President returned to Otis to take her home and gave an impromptu speech to thank nurses

Kennedy\nAfter her husband's assassination, Jacqueline Kennedy relied heavily on her brother-in-law Robert F Kennedy; she observed him to be the \"least like his father\" of the Kennedy brothers [149] He had been a source of support after she had suffered a miscarriage early in her marriage; it was he, not her husband, who stayed with her in the hospital [150] In the aftermath of the assassination, Robert became a surrogate father for her children until eventual demands by his own large family and his responsibilities as attorney general required him to reduce attention [133] He credited her with convincing him to stay in politics, and she supported his 1964 run for United States senator from New York [151]\n\n\nMarriage to Aristotle Onassis\nAfter Robert Kennedy's death in 1968, Kennedy reportedly suffered a relapse of the depression she had suffered in the days following her husband's assassination nearly five years prior [158] She came to fear for her life and those of her two children, saying: \"If they're killing Kennedys, then my children are targets ..

Growing up, Jacqueline was exposed to the finer things in life, including fine art, music, and literature. She was an accomplished student, participating in the school's art and drama clubs and writing for its newspaper.\n\n**College and Early Career**\n\nIn the fall of 1947, Jacqueline Bouvier entered Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York, a women's institution at the time. She had wanted to attend Sarah Lawrence College, closer to New York City, but her parents insisted on Vassar. Jacqueline was an accomplished student, but she did not take an active part in Vassar's social life, preferring to travel back to Manhattan for the weekends. She made her debut to high society in the summer before entering college and became a frequent presence in New York social functions.\n\n**Marriage to John F. Kennedy**\n\nJacqueline met U.S. Representative John F. Kennedy at a dinner party hosted by journalist Charles L. Bartlett in May 1952. She was attracted to Kennedy's physical appearance, wit, and wealth. The pair shared similarities in Catholicism, writing, and enjoying reading. Kennedy was busy running for the U.S. Senate seat in Massachusetts; the relationship grew more serious, and he proposed to her after the November election.\n\n**First Lady of the United States (1961-1963)**\n\nOn January 2, 1960, John F. Kennedy announced his candidacy for the presidency at the Russell Senate Office Building, and launched his campaign nationwide. Jacqueline accompanied her husband to campaign events, including whistle-stops and dinners. Shortly after the campaign began, she became pregnant, and due to her previous high-risk pregnancies, she decided to stay at home in Georgetown. Jacqueline participated in the campaign by writing a weekly syndicated newspaper column, \"Campaign Wife,\" answering correspondence, and giving interviews to the media.\n\n**Campaign for Presidency**\n\nOn January 2, 1960, John F. Kennedy announced his candidacy for the presidency at the Russell Senate Office Building, and launched his campaign nationwide. Jacqueline accompanied her husband to campaign events, including whistle-stops and dinners. Shortly after the campaign began, she became pregnant, and due to her previous high-risk pregnancies, she decided to stay at home in Georgetown. Jacqueline participated in the campaign by writing a weekly syndicated newspaper column, \"Campaign Wife,\" answering correspondence, and giving interviews to the media.\n\n**As First Lady**\n\nOn November 8, 1960, John F. Kennedy narrowly defeated Republican opponent Richard Nixon in the U.S. presidential election. A little over two weeks later, on November 25, Jacqueline gave birth to the couple's first son, John F. Kennedy Jr. She spent two weeks recuperating in the hospital, during which the most minute details of both her and her son's conditions were reported by the media.\n\n**White House Restoration**\n\nKennedy had visited the White House on two occasions before she became First Lady: the first time as a grade-school tourist in 1941 and again as the guest of outgoing First Lady Mamie Eisenhower shortly before her husband's inauguration. She was dismayed to find that the mansion's rooms were furnished with undistinguished pieces that displayed little historical significance. Kennedy made it her first major project as First Lady to restore its historical character.\n\n**Foreign Trips**\n\nJackie Kennedy was a cultural ambassador of the United States, known for her cultural and diplomatic work globally. She traveled without President Kennedy to different countries to promote cultural exchange and diplomatic relations. She was highly regarded by foreign dignitaries, using her fluency in foreign languages and cultural knowledge to establish strong relationships with foreign leaders and give speeches.\n\n**Death of Infant Son**\n\nIn early 1963, Kennedy was again pregnant, which led her to curtail her official duties. She spent most of the summer at a home she and the President had rented on Squaw Island, which was near the Kennedy compound on Cape Cod, Massachusetts. On August 7, she went into labor and gave birth to a boy, Patrick Bouvier Kennedy, via emergency Caesarean section at nearby Otis Air Force Base.\n\n**Assassination and Funeral of John F. Kennedy**\n\nOn November 21, 1963, the First Lady and the President embarked on a political trip to Texas with several goals in mind. The motorcade was to take them to the Trade Mart, where the President was scheduled to speak at a lunch. The First Lady was seated to her husband's left in the third row of seats in the presidential limousine, with the Governor and his wife seated in front of them.\n\n**Life Following the Assassination (1963-1975)**\n\nAfter her husband's assassination, Jacqueline Kennedy relied heavily on her brother-in-law Robert F. Kennedy. She observed him to be the \"least like his father\" of the Kennedy brothers. He had been a source of support after she had suffered a miscarriage early in her marriage; it was he, not her husband, who stayed with her in the hospital.\n\n**Marriage to Aristotle Onassis**\n\nAfter Robert Kennedy's death in 1968, Kennedy reportedly suffered a relapse of the depression she had suffered in the days following her husband's assassination nearly five years prior. She came to fear for her life and those of her two children, saying: \"If they're killing Kennedys, then my children are targets .. I want to get out of this country.\"\n\n**Later Years (1975-1990s)**\n\nAfter the death of her second husband, Onassis returned permanently to the United States, splitting her time between Manhattan, Martha's Vineyard, and the Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts. In 1975, she became a consulting editor at Viking Press, a position that she held for two years.\n\n**Illness, Death, and Funeral**\n\nIn November 1993, Onassis was thrown from her horse while participating in a fox hunt in Middleburg, Virginia, and was taken to the hospital to be examined. A swollen lymph node was discovered in her groin, which was initially diagnosed by the doctor to be caused by an infection. The fall from the horse contributed to her deteriorating health over the next six months.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nJacqueline Kennedy's marriage to Aristotle Onassis caused her popularity to decline sharply among an American public who viewed it as a betrayal of the assassinated president. Her lavish lifestyle as Onassis's \"trophy wife\" led the press to portray her as \"a spendthrift and a reckless woman.\"\n\n**Style Icon**\n\nJacqueline Kennedy became a global fashion icon during her husband's presidency. She commissioned French-born American fashion designer and Kennedy family friend Oleg Cassini to create an original wardrobe for her appearances as First Lady. From 1961 to 1963, Cassini dressed her in many of her ensembles, including her Inauguration Day fawn coat and Inaugural gala gown, as well as many outfits for her visits to Europe, India, and Pakistan.\n\n**Historical Assessments**\n\nIn 2020, Time magazine included her name on its list of 100 Women of the Year. She was named Woman of the Year 1962 for her efforts in uplifting the American history and art.\n\n**Honors and Memorials**\n\nJaclyn Smith portrays Jacqueline Kennedy in the 1981 television film Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy, depicting her life until the end of the JFK presidency. The film's producer Louis Rudolph stated an interest in creating a \"positive portrait of a woman who I thought had been very much maligned,\" comments that were interpreted by John J.

early American furniture expert Henry du Pont [88] To solve the funding problem, a White House guidebook was published, sales of which were used for the restoration [88] Working with Rachel Lambert Mellon, Jacqueline Kennedy also oversaw the redesign and replanting of the Rose Garden and the East Garden, which was renamed the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden after her husband's assassination In addition, Kennedy helped to stop the destruction of historic homes in Lafayette Square in Washington, D.C., because she felt these buildings were an important part of the nation's capital and played an essential role in its history She helped to stop the destruction of historic buildings along the square, including the Renwick Building, now part of the Smithsonian Institution, and her support of

vengeful villainy of a corrupt cop, stands its ground even as the law takes its course.\" [26] When asked whether this change in narrative style post-interval was intentional, Jeethu replied: \"I really don't understand when people say the first half lacked pace A story or a film has its own way of progression and it does travel in a zig-zag away, capturing all the ups and downs of our lives Right from the start if you accelerate the pace, sooner or later, the story-telling will lose its steam.\" [14]\n\n\nMusic\nDrishyam's soundtrack album features two songs used in the film, each of

This condition affects the skin, joints, and various internal organs, causing a wide range of symptoms and complications. Scleroderma is a complex and multifaceted disease, and its exact cause is still not fully understood, although genetic and environmental factors are believed to play a role.\n\n## Signs and Symptoms\n\nThe signs and symptoms of scleroderma can vary widely depending on the severity and progression of the disease. Common symptoms include:\n\n* Thickening and hardening of the skin, which can become tight and shiny\n* Raynaud's phenomenon, a condition characterized by a sudden and temporary narrowing of the blood vessels in response to cold temperatures or stress\n* Nail-fold capillary changes, which can cause changes in the appearance of the fingernails and toenails\n* Antinuclear antibodies, which are a type of autoantibody that can be detected in the blood\n* Systemic organ involvement, which can include the lungs, heart, kidneys, and gastrointestinal tract\n\nOther symptoms may include:\n\n* Fatigue and weakness\n* Joint pain and stiffness\n* Muscle weakness and wasting\n* Swelling of the hands and feet\n* Shortness of breath\n* Chest pain\n* Abdominal pain and diarrhea\n* Kidney dysfunction and failure\n\n## Cause\n\nThe exact cause of scleroderma is still not fully understood, but it is believed to result from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Mutations in HLA genes are thought to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of some cases, and exposure to certain environmental toxins, such as silica, aromatic and chlorinated solvents, and welding fumes, may also contribute to the development of the disease.\n\n## Pathophysiology\n\nScleroderma is characterized by increased synthesis of collagen, leading to the deposition of excess collagen in the skin and other organs. This process is mediated by the activation of fibroblasts, which are specialized cells that produce collagen and other extracellular matrix proteins. The deposition of excess collagen leads to the hardening and tightening of the skin, as well as the formation of fibrotic lesions in other organs.\n\nThe pathogenesis of scleroderma is thought to involve a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors, including:\n\n* Activation of T lymphocytes, which are a type of immune cell that plays a key role in the development of autoimmune diseases\n* Production of altered connective tissue, which can lead to the formation of fibrotic lesions\n* Increased expression of certain genes, including genes involved in the regulation of collagen synthesis and degradation\n\n## Diagnosis\n\nDiagnosis of scleroderma is often based on a combination of clinical findings, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. Typical scleroderma is classically defined as symmetrical skin thickening, with about 70% of cases also presenting with Raynaud's phenomenon, nail-fold capillary changes, and antinuclear antibodies. Affected individuals may also experience systemic organ involvement.\n\nNo single test for scleroderma works all of the time, and diagnosis is often a matter of exclusion. Atypical scleroderma may show any variation of these changes without skin changes or with finger swelling only.\n\n## Differential\n\nDiseases that are often in the differential diagnosis for scleroderma include:\n\n* Systemic lupus erythematosus\n* Rheumatoid arthritis\n* Dermatomyositis\n* Polymyositis\n* Sjögren's syndrome\n* Mixed connective tissue disease\n\n## Classification\n\nScleroderma is characterized by the appearance of circumscribed or diffuse, hard, smooth, ivory-colored areas that are immobile and which give the appearance of hidebound skin. The disease can occur in both localized and systemic forms.\n\nLocalized scleroderma typically affects the skin and is characterized by the formation of circumscribed lesions. Systemic scleroderma, on the other hand, affects multiple organs and is characterized by a diffuse pattern of disease.\n\n## Treatment\n\nThere is no cure for scleroderma, although relief of symptoms is often achieved through treatment. Common treatments include:\n\n* Immunosuppressive medications, such as cyclophosphamide and methotrexate\n* Corticosteroids, which can help reduce inflammation and prevent organ damage\n* Immunomodulatory medications, such as rituximab and mycophenolate\n* Medications that can help manage symptoms, such as pain and fatigue\n* Lifestyle modifications, such as avoiding cold temperatures and stress\n\n## Prognosis\n\nThe prognosis for patients with scleroderma varies depending on the severity and progression of the disease. As of 2012, the five-year survival rate for systemic scleroderma was about 85%, whereas the 10-year survival rate was just under 70%. This varies according to the subtype, with localized scleroderma rarely resulting in death and the diffuse systemic form carrying a worse prognosis than the limited form.\n\nMajor scleroderma-related causes of death include pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary fibrosis, and scleroderma renal crisis. Patients with scleroderma are also at a heightened risk for developing osteoporosis and for contracting cancer, particularly liver, lung, hematologic, and bladder cancers.\n\n## Epidemiology\n\nScleroderma most commonly first presents between the ages of 20 and 50 years, although any age group can be affected. Women are four to nine times more likely to develop scleroderma than men.\n\n## Pregnancy\n\nScleroderma in pregnancy is a complex situation, with an increased risk to both mother and child. Overall, scleroderma is associated with reduced fetal weight for gestational age. The treatment for scleroderma often includes known teratogens, such as cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and mycophenolate, so careful avoidance of such drugs during pregnancy is advised. In these cases, hydroxychloroquine and low-dose corticosteroids might be used for disease control.\n\n## See Also\n\n* Raynaud's phenomenon\n* Systemic lupus erythematosus\n* Rheumatoid arthritis\n* Dermatomyositis\n* Polymyositis\n* Sjögren's syndrome\n* Mixed connective tissue disease\n\n## References\n\nThis article is a comprehensive overview of scleroderma, a complex and multifaceted disease.

was Plíšková's worst defeat by ranking since 2013.\n\n\n2022: Hiatus due to injury, major quarterfinal, out of top 30\nPlíšková was forced to withdraw from all events held during the Australian swing, after sustaining a hand injury during training This marked the first time that Plíšková did not appear in a major main draw since the 2012 US Open, when she failed to qualify [55]\n\n\n2023: Fourth Australian Open quarterfinal\nAt the Australian Open, Plíšková reached her fourth quarterfinal defeating Zhang Shuai [56]\n\n\n2024: First title in four years, back to top 40\nPlíšková's first tournament of the season was the Brisbane International, where she defeated Naomi Osaka in the second round in a three-set match, but lost to Jeļena Ostapenko in the third round in another three-set match [13] [note 1] She then participated in the Adelaide International, in which she was defeated by Kateřina Siniaková in the first round in straight sets [13] [note 1] At the Australian Open she was defeated by third seed Elena Rybakina in the first round in straight sets [13] [note 1]\n\n\nPlaying style\nPlíšková utilizes an extremely aggressive style, highlighted by her powerful, accurate serve, forceful groundstrokes, and aggressive net play, to extract errors from opponents or win points outright [61] Her greatest strength is her serve, which is known for its pace, power, and precision She typically generates high first-serve percentages, and is able to serve numerous aces Her first serve speed averages 109 mph (175 km/h), and peaks at 119 mph (192 km/h) [citation needed]; the fast speed of her first serve combined with its accurate placement and disguise make her first serve effective Between 2013 and 2019, Plíšková ranked within the top 10 of the WTA ace count, and served the most aces of any player in 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2019; in 2016, she served 530 aces, the most of any player in a single year in WTA history [62] She double faults infrequently, although she tends to take risks on her second serve when nervous, causing double faults to accumulate Her groundstrokes are powerful, allowing her to hit winners from any position on the court Her strongest groundstroke is her forehand, which she hits flat, with significant pace and power; this shot is responsible for most of the winners she hits on the court She can generate extreme angles with both her forehand and her backhand, allowing her to hit winners at will She also shows accuracy and power on mid-court shots, sometimes following them up to the net, where she can hit the most challenging volleys with ease due to her doubles experience [63] [64] Although she mainly plays from the baseline until she creates the opportunity to approach the net and hit low-risk volley winners, Plíšková will occasionally utilise the serve-and-volley tactic to surprise her opponents This tactic is highly effective – in the 2016 US Open final, she won 80% of her serve-and-volley points [63] Despite her considerable strengths, Plíšková's game is hampered by her poor movement, and lacklustre footwork Although her movement has improved significantly since turning professional, it is still the weakest area of her game, allowing opponents to hit low-risk winners, due to the fact that she cannot reach the winning shot fast enough Due to her poor movement, she struggles against defensive players who counterpunch, and aim to move her around the baseline – she possesses losing head-to-head records against many elite defensive players, including Simona Halep, Agnieszka Radwańska, Angelique Kerber, Caroline Wozniacki, Elina Svitolina, Ashleigh Barty, and Sloane Stephens [65] Plíšková's game is remarkably malleable, and is suited to all surfaces; she has won titles on hard, clay, and grass courts, although her quick and aggressive style of play is especially suited to hard courts.\n\n\nCoaches\nPlíšková has had several coaches throughout her career; Jiří Vaněk (2014–16), David Kotyza (2017), and Tomáš Krupa (2017–18) After parting with Krupa, she united with Rennae Stubbs for the 2018 US Open, although the partnership ended at the end of the year, so that Stubbs could return to her career as a TV tennis commentator [66] She was coached by Conchita Martínez throughout the 2019 season; their partnership ended that year when Martínez began to coach Garbiñe Muguruza In 2019, Plíšková announced that she would be coached by ATP coach Daniel Vallverdú for the 2020 season [67] Due to a string of poor results, their partnership ended at the end of 2020.\n\n\nEndorsements\nPlíšková is currently endorsed by Adidas for clothing and footwear since the 2024 Australian Open She was previously endorsed by Fila for clothing and footwear since 2016, and uses Babolat racquets, specifically endorsing the Pure Drive range of racquets [citation needed]\n\n\nCareer statistics\n Chris Evert (1975/1985 – 260 w)\n Evonne Goolagong (1976 – 2 w)\n Martina

Plíšková\n\nKarolína Plíšková (born March 21, 1992) is a Czech professional tennis player. She is a former world No. 1 and has won two Grand Slam singles titles.\n\nPersonal life\nPlíšková was born in Louny to Radek Plíšek and Martina Plíšková, and has an identical twin sister, Kristýna, who is two minutes older and is also a tennis player. She currently lives in Monte Carlo.\n\nCareer\nKarolína Plíšková won the Australian Open junior title, defeating Laura Robson in the girls' final.\n\n2010: Juniors\nKarolína Plíšková won the Australian Open junior title, defeating Laura Robson in the girls' final.\n\n2012: Major debut\nPlíšková played her first senior Grand Slam tournament main draw at the 2012 French Open. To qualify, she defeated Dia Evtimova, Tamaryn Hendler, and Laura Robson. She lost in the first round to world No 8, Marion Bartoli, in straight sets.\n\n2013: First tour title\nPlíšková started the year in Brisbane International. She however lost to Olga Puchkova in the first round in two sets. Then in her next tournament in Sydney, she qualified, beating Alexandra Panova, Irina Falconi, and Estrella Cabeza Candela. In the first round, she lost to the third seed, Sara Errani.\n\n2014: Breakthrough, two titles, top 25 debut\n2014 was a breakthrough year for Plíšková. After consecutive second-round finishes in Auckland and at the Australian Open, she reached her second career WTA tour final in Pattaya City, defeating top-50 players Bethanie Mattek-Sands and Sorana Cîrstea before losing to Ekaterina Makarova in the final. She then reached the third round of Indian Wells, the quarterfinals of the Monterrey Open, and the semifinals in Kuala Lumpur between March and April. In May, she reached her third career final in Nuremberg, losing to second seed Eugenie Bouchard in three sets. She broke into the top-50 in July and defeated world No 9, Ana Ivanovic, in the second round of the US Open. After playing in America, she reached two finals in two consecutive weeks – in Hong Kong, where she lost to Sabine Lisicki, and in Seoul, which she won, defeating Varvara Lepchenko in the final to take her second career title. In October, she won her third title and second of the year in Linz. As an alternate, Plíšková made a round-robin appearance at the season-closing Tournament of Champions, in lieu of top seed Ekaterina Makarova, losing her sole match against Flavia Pennetta.\n\n2015: Top 10 debut\nPlíšková began her year at the Brisbane International where she defeated former world No 1 and two-time Grand Slam champion, Victoria Azarenka, in the first round before losing in the second. She reached her first WTA Premier-level final at the Sydney International defeating Carla Suárez Navarro and Angelique Kerber, before losing to fellow Czech, Petra Kvitová, in two tie-breaking sets. As a consequence of this run, she broke into the world's top 20 for the first time in her career.\n\n2016: US Open final, top 5, rise in doubles\nPlíšková began her season at the 2016 Hopman Cup, where she partnered with Jiří Veselý to represent the Czech Republic. She recorded singles wins over Jarmila Wolfe and Victoria Duval.\n\n2017: French Open semifinal and world No. 1\nIn 2017, Plíšková started the season by playing in Brisbane, where she beat Yulia Putintseva and qualifier Asia Muhammad in two sets and then Roberta Vinci in three sets. She then defeated Elina Svitolina and Alizé Cornet (both in straight sets) and won her 7th title.\n\n2018: Australian and US Open quarterfinals\nIn Brisbane, Plíšková lost in the semifinals to Elina Svitolina. At the Australian Open, she reached quarterfinals for the second time, having defeated Verónica Cepede Royg, Beatriz Haddad Maia, Lucie Šafářová, and Barbora Strýcová. In the quarterfinals, she lost to Halep in straight sets. In Doha, she reached the third round, after receiving a first-round bye and defeating Alizé Cornet in second round in straight sets. In round three, she fell to American teenager Cici Bellis in straight sets, thus failing to defend her title. In Dubai, after receiving first round bye, she defeated Suárez Navarro in three sets in the second round. In the quarterfinals, she was defeated by Angelique Kerber in straight sets. In Indian Wells, Plíšková reached the quarterfinals where she lost to eventual champion, Naomi Osaka. At the following tournament, the Miami Open, Plíšková was defeated by wildcard and former champion Victoria Azarenka in the quarterfinals.\n\n2019: Grand Slam semifinal, second Premier-5 title\nPlíšková opened her season at the Brisbane International, seeded fifth. She defeated Yulia Putintseva, Marie Bouzková, Ajla Tomljanović, Donna Vekić, and Lesia Tsurenko to win the title.\n\n2020: Mixed results\nAt Brisbane, Plíšková defeated Ajla Tomljanović, Alison Riske, Naomi Osaka, and Madison Keys to successfully defend her title, and set a record for the most Brisbane International titles. At the Australian Open, she defeated Kristina Mladenovic and Laura Siegemund, before falling to Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova in the third round. At Dubai, Plíšková defeated Kristina Mladenovic, losing just three games, before losing in the quarterfinals to eventual finalist Elena Rybakina. Before the suspension of the WTA Tour due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Plíšková was ranked No 3 in the world.\n\n2021: Wimbledon final, fifth consecutive WTA Finals, back to top 3\nPlíšková's first tournament of the year was at Abu Dhabi. She defeated lucky loser Despina Papamichail in the first round. In the second round, Plíšková was defeated by qualifier and world No 292, Anastasia Gasanova, in straight sets, despite this being Gasanova's first appearance in a WTA Tour main draw. This was Plíšková's worst defeat by ranking since 2013.\n\n2022: Hiatus due to injury, major quarterfinal, out of top 30\nPlíšková was forced to withdraw from all events held during the Australian swing, after sustaining a hand injury during training. This marked the first time that Plíšková did not appear in a major main draw since the 2012 US Open, when she failed to qualify.\n\n2023: Fourth Australian Open quarterfinal\nAt the Australian Open, Plíšková reached her fourth quarterfinal defeating Zhang Shuai.\n\n2024: First title in four years, back to top 40\nPlíšková's first tournament of the season was the Brisbane International, where she defeated Naomi Osaka in the second round in a three-set match, but lost to Jeļena Ostapenko in the third round in another three-set match. At the Australian Open she was defeated by third seed Elena Rybakina in the first round in straight sets.\n\nPlaying style\nPlíšková utilizes an extremely aggressive style, highlighted by her powerful, accurate serve, forceful groundstrokes, and aggressive net play, to extract errors from opponents or win points outright. Her greatest strength is her serve, which is known for its pace, power, and precision. She typically generates high first-serve percentages, and is able to serve numerous aces. Her first serve speed averages 109 mph (175 km/h), and peaks at 119 mph (192 km/h). Between 2013 and 2019, Plíšková ranked within the top 10 of the WTA ace count, and served the most aces of any player in 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2019; in 2016, she served 530 aces, the most of any player in a single year in WTA history. She double faults infrequently, although she tends to take risks on her second serve when nervous, causing double faults to accumulate. Her groundstrokes are powerful, allowing her to hit winners from any position on the court. Her strongest groundstroke is her forehand, which she hits flat, with significant pace and power; this shot is responsible for most of the winners she hits on the court. She can generate extreme angles with both her forehand and her backhand, allowing her to hit winners at will. She also shows accuracy and power on mid-court shots, sometimes following them up to the net, where she can hit the most challenging volleys with ease due to her doubles experience. Although she mainly plays from the baseline until she creates the opportunity to approach the net and hit low-risk volley winners, Plíšková will occasionally utilise the serve-and-volley tactic to surprise her opponents. This tactic is highly effective – in the 2016 US Open final, she won 80% of her serve-and-volley points.\n\nCoaches\nPlíšková has had several coaches throughout her career; Jiří Vaněk (2014–16), David Kotyza (2017), and Tomáš Krupa (2017–18) After parting with Krupa, she united with Rennae Stubbs for the 2018 US Open, although the partnership ended at the end of the year, so that Stubbs could return to her career as a TV tennis commentator. She was coached by Conchita Martínez throughout the 2019 season; their partnership ended that year when Martínez began to coach Garbiñe Muguruza. In 2019, Plíšková announced that she would be coached by ATP coach Daniel Vallverdú for the 2020 season. Due to a string of poor results, their partnership ended at the end of 2020.\n\nEndorsements\nPlíšková is currently endorsed by Adidas for clothing and footwear since the 2024 Australian Open. She was previously endorsed by Fila for clothing and footwear since 2016, and uses Babolat racquets, specifically endorsing the Pure Drive range of racquets.\n\nReferences\nExternal links", "prompt":

aggressive style, highlighted by her powerful, accurate serve, forceful groundstrokes, and aggressive net play, to extract errors from opponents or win points outright [61] Her greatest strength is her serve, which is known for its pace, power, and precision She typically generates high first-serve percentages, and is able to serve numerous aces Her first serve speed averages 109 mph (175 km/h), and peaks at 119 mph (192 km/h) [citation needed]; the fast speed of her first serve combined with its accurate placement and disguise make her first serve effective Between 2013 and 2019, Plíšková

80% of her serve-and-volley points [63] Despite her considerable strengths, Plíšková's game is hampered by her poor movement, and lacklustre footwork Although her movement has improved significantly since turning professional, it is still the weakest area of her game, allowing opponents to hit low-risk winners, due to the fact that she cannot reach the winning shot fast enough Due to her poor movement, she struggles against defensive players who counterpunch, and aim to move her around the baseline – she possesses losing head-to-head records against many elite defensive players, including Simona Halep, Agnieszka Radwańska, Angelique Kerber, Caroline Wozniacki, Elina Svitolina, Ashleigh Barty, and Sloane Stephens [65] Plíšková's game is remarkably malleable, and is suited to all surfaces; she has won titles on hard, clay, and grass courts, although her quick and aggressive style of play is especially suited to hard courts.\n\n\nCoaches\nPlíšková has had several coaches

The festival marks the triumph of good over evil and is associated with the legend of Lord Rama's victory over Ravana, the demon king. The celebration is a vibrant and spectacular event, with various regional and cultural variations.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe name \"Vijayadashami\" is a Sanskrit compound of two words: \"vijaya,\" meaning \"victory,\" and \"daśamī,\" meaning \"tenth day.\" This refers to the festival's association with the tenth day of the bright half of the lunar month of Ashvina, which falls in September or October.\n\n**Epic Literature**\n\nThe celebration of Vijayadashami is rooted in the epic Ramayana, which narrates the story of Lord Rama's battle against Ravana. According to the epic, Ravana kidnaps Sita, Rama's wife, and takes her to his kingdom in Lanka. Rama, with the help of his brother Lakshmana and the vanara king Sugriva, launches a war against Ravana and his army. After a prolonged and fierce battle, Rama finally defeats Ravana, killing him and ending his evil rule. This victory is seen as a triumph of good over evil and is celebrated as Vijayadashami.\n\n**Regional Variations**\n\nVijayadashami is celebrated in various ways across different regions of India and Nepal. In most of Northern India, the festival is celebrated in honor of Lord Rama, with dramatic performances of the Ramayana, known as Ramlila, enacted over nine days leading up to the festival. In many places, effigies of Ravana and his brothers, Kumbhakarna and Meghnath, are created and burnt on bonfires in the evening.\n\n**Northern India**\n\nIn most of Northern India, Vijayadashami is celebrated in honor of Lord Rama. The Ramlila, a dramatic performance of the Ramayana, is enacted over nine days leading up to the festival. This performance is inspired by the Ramcharitmanas, a Hindu text written by Tulsidas. Effigies of Ravana, Kumbhakarna, and Meghnath are created and burnt on bonfires in the evening.\n\n**Himachal Pradesh**\n\nKullu Dussehra is celebrated in the Kullu valley of Himachal Pradesh and is regionally notable for its large fair and parade witnessed by an estimated half a million people. The festival is a symbol of the victory of good over evil by Raghunath, and is celebrated like elsewhere in the Indian subcontinent with a procession. The special feature of the Kullu Dussehra procession is the arrival of floats containing deities from different parts of the nearby regions and their journey to Kullu.\n\n**Southern India**\n\nVijayadashami is celebrated in various ways in Southern India. Celebrations range from worshipping Durga, lighting up temples and major forts, such as at Mysore, to displaying colorful figurines, known as a gombe habba.\n\n**Western India**\n\nIn Gujarat, people engage in the popular festival, Navaratri, a nine-day festival that takes place before Vijayadashami. Both the goddess Durga and Rama are revered for their victory over evil. Fasting and prayers at temples are common, and a regional dance called Dandiya Raas, which deploys colorfully decorated sticks, and garba, another type of regional dance, is a part of the festivities through the night.\n\n**Eastern India**\n\nIn West Bengal, Vijaya Dashami is observed as Bijoya Dashomi, immediately after Navami, the ninth and last day of Durga Puja. It is marked by processions in which idols are carried in carriages to a pond, river, or ocean for a solemn good-bye to Goddess Durga, along with firecracker bursting, dance, drum beats, music, and revelry. Many mark their faces with vermilion or wear red clothing. It is an emotional day for some devotees, especially the Bengali Hindus, and even for many atheists as the congregation sings goodbye songs.\n\n**Nepal**\n\nIn Nepal, Vijayadashami follows the festival of Dashain. Youngsters visit the elders in their family, distant ones come to their native homes, students visit their school teachers, and government workers visit the head of the state. The elders and teachers welcome the youngsters and bless them for virtuous success and prosperity in the year ahead. Elders give \"dakshina,\" or a small amount of money, to younger relatives at this time along with the blessings. It is celebrated for 15 days from Shukla Paksha to Poornima. The red tika or simply tika symbolizes the blessings of goddess Durga, and red also symbolizes the blood that ties the family together.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Durga Puja\n* Navaratri\n* Ramlila\n* Ramayana\n* Dussehra\n* Dasara\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The festival is celebrated in various ways across different regions of India and Nepal.\n* The celebration is associated with the legend of Lord Rama's victory over Ravana, the demon king.\n* The festival is a symbol of the triumph of good over evil.\n* The festival is celebrated for 10 days, from the first day of the bright half of the lunar month of Ashvina to the tenth day.\n* The festival is celebrated with various regional and cultural variations.\n* The festival is marked by processions, dramatic performances, and the burning of effigies.\n* The festival is a significant event in the Hindu calendar.\n* The festival is celebrated with great enthusiasm and fervor.\n* The festival is a time for family and friends to come together and celebrate.\n* The festival is a time for worship and devotion.\n* The festival is a time for joy and celebration.\n* The festival is a time for new beginnings.\n\n**References**\n\n* Ramayana\n* Ramcharitmanas\n* Ramlila\n* Durga Puja\n* Navaratri\n* Dussehra\n* Dasara\n* Hindu Calendar\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n* Ramayana\n* Ramcharitmanas\n* Ramlila\n* Durga Puja\n* Navaratri\n* Dussehra\n* Dasara\n* Hindu Calendar\n* Indian Festivals\n* Hinduism\n* Culture\n* Traditions\n\n**External Links**\n\n* Wikipedia\n* Google\n* YouTube\n* Hindu Festival Calendars\n* Indian Festivals\n* Hinduism\n* Culture\n* Traditions", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Vijayadashami\" following this outline:\n\n\nEtymology\nVijayādaśamī (विजयादशमी) is a compound of the two words vijaya (विजय, 'victory') [16] and daśamī (दशमी, 'tenth day'), [17] connoting the festival on the tenth day celebrating the victory of good over evil [1] [9] [18] The same Hindu festival-related term, however, takes different forms in different regions of India and Nepal, as well as among Hindu minorities found elsewhere [19]\n\n\nEpic literature\nThe celebration of this festival is founded in the epic Ramayana It marks the day Rama is regarded to have slain the rakshasa king Ravana, who had abducted Rama's wife, Sita [23] Ravana kidnaps Sita and takes her to his kingdom in Lanka (identified with present day Sri Lanka) Rama asks Ravana to release her, but Ravana refuses;

(2002–2023)\nOn May 6, 2002, the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) changed both its company name and the name of its wrestling promotion to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) after the company lost a lawsuit initiated by the World Wildlife Fund over the WWF trademark [57] [58] Although mainly caused by an unfavorable ruling in its dispute with the World Wildlife Fund regarding the \"WWF\"

on entertainment [59]\n\n\nFirst brand split (2002–2011)\nIn March 2002, WWE decided to create two separate rosters, with each group of wrestlers appearing on one of their main programs, Raw and SmackDown!, due to the overabundance of talent left over from the Invasion storyline and the ensuing absorption of WCW and ECW contracts This was dubbed as the \"brand extension\".\n\n\nBrand reunification (2011–2016)\nBeginning with the August 29, 2011, episode, Raw - referred to as Raw Supershow - featured talent from both Raw and SmackDown (the \"Supershow\" epithet would be dropped on July 23, 2012) [63] Championships previously exclusive to one show or the other were available for wrestlers from any show to compete for; the \"Supershow\" format would mark the end of the brand split, as all programming and live events (until July 2016) featured the full WWE roster [64]\n\n\nLaunch of second brand split (2016–2020)\nOn May 25, 2016, WWE relaunched the brand split, billed as the \"New Era\" Subsequently, Raw and SmackDown have each featured their unique rosters, announcers, championships and ring sets/ropes A draft took place to determine which wrestlers would appear on what show SmackDown also moved from Thursdays to Tuesday nights, which began on July 19 (the night of the aforementioned draft), and airs live instead of the previous pre-recorded format [72]\n\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic and return to touring (2020–2022)\nIn March 2020, WWE began to be impacted by the American onset of the COVID-19 pandemic In mid-March, three of the four major sports leagues closed locker rooms to the media as a precautionary measure As other sports cancellations and postponements were being introduced, WWE began to film its weekly programs at the Performance Center without spectators and with only essential staff present, beginning with the March 13 episode of SmackDown –  the March 11 episode of NXT had been recorded at the Performance Center with paying fans, thus being WWE's last event to have ticketed fans in attendance before the pandemic took full effect [83] [84] WrestleMania 36 was scheduled to take place on April 5 at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa but on March 16, was moved to Orlando to be held behind closed doors [85] [86] WrestleMania, as well as Raw and SmackDown for a period before and after WrestleMania, shifted from live broadcasts to a pre-recorded format [87] NXT continued to air from Full Sail University, but under similar restrictions [88] [89]\n\n\nChanges in leadership (2022–2023)\nOn June 17, 2022, amidst an investigation by WWE's Board of Directors into reported \"hush money\" paid to a former employee by Vince McMahon following an affair, Mr McMahon stepped down as chairman and CEO of WWE and was replaced by his daughter, Stephanie McMahon, as the interim chairwoman of WWE [117] [118] Despite the change Vince McMahon came out on WWE SmackDown, that night opening the show with a brief speech, the highlights of which \"then, now, forever and most importantly together\" was quoted by various news media as Vince letting people know that he was still in creative control from behind the scenes [119] [120] On July 22, 2022, Vince McMahon officially retired, stating on Twitter, \"At 77, time for me to retire Thank you, WWE Universe Then Now Forever Together.\" [121] Following Vince's retirement, Stephanie

Talent Relations and later being promoted to Chief Content Officer [123] [124] Commentators have highlighted the significance of McMahon's retirement, saying that it marked the historic start of a new period in WWE's history [125] [126] [127] [128] [129] [130] [131] The 2022 SummerSlam event held on July 30, 2022, was the first WWE pay-per-view event to be held under the leadership of Stephanie McMahon and Triple H [132] [133]\n\n\nAcquisition of WWE by Endeavor (2023)\nOn April 3, 2023; WWE and Endeavor reached a deal under which WWE would merge with UFC's parent company Endeavor to form a new company, which would go public on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol \"TKO\" Endeavor will hold a 51% stake in \"TKO\", with WWE's shareholders having a 49% stake, [141] valuing

Endeavor CEO Ari Emanuel becoming CEO, with Mark Shapiro as president and chief operating officer Emanuel will not take on any creative roles with WWE's head of creative Paul Levesque expected to

control of the WWF to his wife Linda [195] The case went to trial in 1994, where McMahon himself was accused of distributing steroids to his wrestlers [196] One notable prosecution witness was Nailz (real name: Kevin Wacholz), a former WWF performer who had been fired after a violent confrontation with McMahon Nailz testified that McMahon had ordered him to use steroids, but his credibility was called into question during his testimony as he repeatedly stated that he \"hated\" McMahon [197] [198] The jury would later acquit McMahon of the charges and he resumed his role in the day-to day operations of the WWF [199]\n\n\n1990s drug scandal\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, George Zahorian was thought to have routinely distributed steroids and other drugs to WWF wrestlers, supposedly with

WCW implying that Scott Hall and Kevin Nash (Razor Ramon and Diesel) were invading WCW on the WWF's behalf This led to a series of lawsuits filed by both companies as the Monday Night War heated up The lawsuit went on for years, ending with a settlement in 2000 One of the terms gave then WWF the right to bid on WCW's assets if the company were liquidated AOL Time Warner, the then-parent company of WCW, canceled WCW's television shows in March 2001 and sold the company assets to the WWF [202] [unreliable source?]\n\n\nOwen Hart's death\nOn May 23, 1999, Owen Hart fell to his death in Kansas City, Missouri during the Over the Edge pay-per-view event in a stunt that went wrong WWF broke kayfabe by having television commentator Jim Ross repeatedly tell those watching live on pay-per-view that what had just transpired was not a wrestling angle or storyline and that Hart was hurt badly, emphasizing the seriousness of the situation [207] While several attempts to revive him were made, he died from his injuries The cause of death was later revealed to be internal bleeding from blunt force trauma The WWF management controversially chose to continue the event [208] Later, Jim Ross revealed Hart's death to the home viewers during the pay-per-view, but not to the crowd in the arena [209] While the show did go on, it has never been released commercially by WWF Home Video In 2014, fifteen years after his death, the WWE Network aired the event for the first time A small photo tribute is shown before the start informing fans that Hart died during the original broadcast All footage of Hart was edited out of the event The statement reads: \"In Memory of Owen Hart May 7, 1965 – May 23, 1999 who accidentally passed away during this broadcast.\" [210] Four weeks after the event, the Hart family sued the WWF over how dangerous and poorly planned the stunt was, and that the harness system was defective [211] After over a year and a half into the case, a settlement was

which both organizations had been using since at least March 1979 Under the agreement, Titan had agreed to cease using the written acronym \"WWF\" in connection with its wrestling promotion, and to minimize (though not eliminate) spoken uses of \"WWF\" on its broadcasts, particularly in scripted comments In exchange, the environmental group (and its national affiliates) agreed to drop any pending litigation against Titan, and agreed not to challenge Titan's use of the full \"World Wrestling Federation\" name or the promotion's then-current logo [221]\n\n\nHarry Slash and the Slashtones lawsuit\nHarry \"Slash\" Grivas and Roderick Kohn filed a lawsuit against WWE in June 2003 due to the music being used for its programming and DVDs without consent or payment It also asserted a

catalog outright in January 2005 [228]\n\n\nUltimate Warrior-related disputes\nIn 1993, Jim Hellwig, known in the WWF as \"The Ultimate Warrior\", legally changed his name to the mononym Warrior [229] [230] This one-word name appears on all legal documents pertaining to Warrior, and his children carry the Warrior name as their legal surname [231] Warrior and the WWF engaged in a series of lawsuits and legal actions in 1996 and 1998, [232] where both parties sought a declaration that they owned the characters, Warrior and Ultimate Warrior, under both contract and copyright law The court ruled

sexually assaulted at a US military base during a 2006 WWE tour of Kuwait by a man posing as a doctor, and that WWE officials persuaded her to not report it to the appropriate authorities as they did not want it to affect the company's relationship with the military [270] WWE officials would later claim they had no knowledge of Massaro's alleged sexual assault.\n\n\nMisconduct allegations involving Vince McMahon\nOne of the first allegations against Vince McMahon was made on April 3, 1992, when Rita Chatterton, a former referee noted for her stint as Rita Marie in the WWF in the 1980s and for being the first female referee in the WWF (possibly in professional wrestling history), [276] made an appearance on Geraldo Rivera's show Now It Can Be Told She claimed that on July 16, 1986, McMahon tried to force her to perform oral sex on him in his limousine; when she refused, he raped her [277] Former wrestler Leonard Inzitari has corroborated Chatterton's allegation [278] Several years later, on February 1, 2006, McMahon was accused of sexual harassment by a worker at a tanning bar in Boca Raton, Florida [279] At first, the charge appeared to be discredited because McMahon was in Miami for the 2006 Royal Rumble at the time It was soon clarified that the alleged incident was reported to police on the day of the Rumble, but actually took place the day before [280] On March 25, it was reported that no charges would be filed against McMahon as a result of the investigation [281] Both Chatterton and a separate tanning spa worker who alleged that McMahon sexually assaulted her in California in 2011 filed civil sex abuse lawsuits against him in late 2022 [282] McMahon would agree to pay  Chatterton an undisclosed multimillion-dollar legal settlement [283]\n\n\nTerminology\nWWE uses a variety of special terms in promoting their product, such as describing the wrestling industry as sports entertainment The fan base is referred to as the \"WWE

referred to as \"NXT Superstars\" Retired wrestlers are described as \"WWE Legends\", while those who have been inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame are called \"Hall of Famers\" [298]\n\n\nWWE Network and distribution deals\nOn February 24, 2014, WWE launched WWE Network, an over-the-top subscription streaming service [68] [69] [70] The service, which was initially proposed as a linear pay television service, [299] [300] carries all WWE pay-per-view events, original programming (including in-ring programs, as well as documentary and reality programming highlighting the promotion and its history), and access to WWE library content such as classic pay-per-views and television episodes from WWE and other promotions that it had acquired [301] The service reached 1,000,000 subscribers on

subjected to independent testing for anabolic steroids for the first time [385] The independent testing was ceased in 1996, being deemed too expensive as the company was going through financial duress at the time as a result of their competitors, World Championship Wrestling, being so overwhelmingly more popular and hurting the federation's business [386]\n\n\nSee

The company has undergone significant changes over the years, including the acquisition of several other wrestling promotions and the expansion into new markets.\n\n**Mid 20th Century**\n\nThe first show under the Capitol Wrestling Corporation was produced on January 7, 1953. There is uncertainty as to whom the founder of the CWC was, with some sources stating that it was Vincent J McMahon, while others cite McMahon's father Jess McMahon as founder. The CWC later joined the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) and famous New York promoter Toots Mondt soon joined the promotion.\n\n**Titan Sports, Inc. (1980-1999)**\n\nVincent J McMahon's son, Vincent K McMahon, and his wife Linda, established Titan Sports, Inc., in 1980 in South Yarmouth, Massachusetts. The company was incorporated on February 21, 1980, in the Cape Cod Coliseum offices, then moved to the building on Holly Hill Lane in Greenwich, Connecticut.\n\n**Early Years (1980-1982)**\n\nThe younger McMahon bought Capitol from his father in 1982, effectively seizing control of the company. The actual date of sale is still unknown, but the generally accepted date is June 6, 1982. However, this was likely only the date the deal was struck but not finalized.\n\n**Boom Period (1982-1992)**\n\nThe younger McMahon bought Capitol from his father in 1982, effectively seizing control of the company. The actual date of sale is still unknown, but the generally accepted date is June 6, 1982. However, this was likely only the date the deal was struck but not finalized. The World Wrestling Federation was not solely owned by Vincent J McMahon but also by Gorilla Monsoon, Arnold Skaaland and Phil Zacko. The deal between the two McMahons was a monthly payment basis, in which if a single payment was missed, ownership would revert to the elder McMahon and his business partners.\n\n**New Generation (1992-1997)**\n\nThe WWF was hit with allegations of steroid abuse and distribution in 1992. This was followed by allegations of sexual harassment by WWF employees the following year. McMahon was eventually exonerated, but the allegations brought bad public relations for the WWF, and an overall bad reputation.\n\n**Start of the Attitude Era (1997-1999)**\n\nAs the Monday Night War continued between Raw Is War and WCW's Nitro, the WWF would transform itself from a family-friendly product into a more adult-oriented product, known as the Attitude Era. The era was spearheaded by WWF VP Shane McMahon and head writer Vince Russo.\n\n**World Wrestling Federation Entertainment, Inc. (1999-2002)**\n\nIn the summer of 1999, Titan Sports, Inc. was renamed World Wrestling Federation Entertainment, Inc. On October 19, 1999, World Wrestling Federation Entertainment, Inc. launched an initial public offering as a publicly traded company, trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) with the issuance of stock then valued at $172.5 million.\n\n**Initial Public Offering (1999)**\n\nIn the summer of 1999, Titan Sports, Inc. was renamed World Wrestling Federation Entertainment, Inc. On October 19, 1999, World Wrestling Federation Entertainment, Inc. launched an initial public offering as a publicly traded company, trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) with the issuance of stock then valued at $172.5 million.\n\n**End of the Attitude Era (1999-2002)**\n\nBy the fall of 1999, the Attitude Era had turned the tide of the Monday Night War into WWF's favor. After Time Warner merged with America Online (AOL), Ted Turner's control over WCW was considerably reduced. The newly merged company lacked interest in professional wrestling as a whole and decided to sell WCW in its entirety.\n\n**Launch of Second Brand Split (2002)**\n\nOn March 25, 2002, WWF launched the brand extension, creating two separate rosters, with each group of wrestlers appearing on one of their main programs, Raw and SmackDown!\n\n**Brand Reunification (2011-2016)**\n\nBeginning with the August 29, 2011, episode, Raw featured talent from both Raw and SmackDown. Championships previously exclusive to one show or the other were available for wrestlers from any show to compete for.\n\n**Launch of Second Brand Split (2016)**\n\nOn May 25, 2016, WWE relaunched the brand split, billed as the \"New Era\" Subsequently, Raw and SmackDown have each featured their unique rosters, announcers, championships and ring sets/ropes.\n\n**COVID-19 Pandemic and Return to Touring (2020-2022)**\n\nIn March 2020, WWE began to be impacted by the American onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. In mid-March, three of the four major sports leagues closed locker rooms to the media as a precautionary measure. WWE began to film its weekly programs at the Performance Center without spectators and with only essential staff present.\n\n**Championships and Accomplishments**\n\nWWE has over 20 different championships, including the WWE Championship, the Universal Championship, and the Raw and SmackDown Women's Championships. The company has also held numerous pay-per-view events and has been the subject of several documentaries and reality TV shows.\n\n**Contracts**\n\nWWE signs most of its talent to exclusive contracts, meaning talent can appear or perform only on WWE programming and events. They are not permitted to appear or perform for another promotion unless special arrangements are made beforehand.\n\n**Stock and Corporate Governance**\n\nOn October 19, 1999, WWF, which had been owned previously by parent company Titan Sports, launched an initial public offering as a publicly traded company, trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) with the issuance of stock then valued at $172.5 million.\n\n**Legal Disputes and Controversies**\n\nWWE has been involved in several high-profile lawsuits and controversies over the years, including allegations of steroid abuse and distribution, allegations of sexual harassment, and a lawsuit filed by the family of wrestler Owen Hart, who died in 1999.\n\n**Relationship with Saudi Arabia**\n\nWWE has been criticized for its decision to hold events in Saudi Arabia, which has a poor human rights record. The company has also been accused of promoting a culture of misogyny and homophobia through its programming.\n\n**Partnerships**\n\nWWE has partnered with several other companies and organizations over the years, including Apple, Google, and the NBA.\n\n**Drug Testing and Wellness Program**\n\nWWE has a comprehensive drug testing and wellness program in place, which includes regular testing for steroids and other performance-enhancing substances.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc.

were dismissed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit [262] The Supreme Court of the United States subsequently declined to hear the case in April 2021 [263]\n\n\nRelationship with Saudi Arabia\nThe events promoted in Saudi Arabia by WWE have been subjected to criticism due to allegations of sportswashing WWE has been accused of contributing to Saudi Arabia's discrimination of LGBT people and women by holding events in the country [264] [265]\n\n\nAshley Massaro affidavit\nPrior to her death on May 15, 2019, former WWE wrestler Ashley Massaro alleged that she was sexually assaulted at a US military base during a 2006 WWE tour of Kuwait by a man posing as a doctor, and that WWE officials persuaded her to not report it to the appropriate authorities as they did not want it to affect the company's relationship with the military [270] WWE officials would later claim they had no knowledge of Massaro's alleged sexual assault.\n\n\nMisconduct allegations involving Vince McMahon\nOne of the first allegations against Vince McMahon was made on April 3, 1992, when Rita Chatterton, a former referee noted for her stint as Rita Marie in the WWF in the 1980s and for being the first female referee in the WWF (possibly in professional wrestling history), [276] made an appearance on Geraldo Rivera's show Now It Can Be Told She claimed that on July 16, 1986, McMahon tried to force her to perform oral sex on him in his limousine; when she refused, he raped her [277] Former wrestler Leonard Inzitari has corroborated Chatterton's allegation [278] Several years later, on February 1, 2006, McMahon was accused of sexual harassment by a worker at a tanning bar in Boca Raton, Florida [279] At first, the charge appeared to be discredited because McMahon was in Miami for the 2006 Royal Rumble at the time It was soon clarified that the alleged incident was reported to police on the day of the Rumble, but actually took place the day before [280] On March 25, it was reported that no charges would be filed against McMahon as a result of the investigation [281] Both Chatterton and a separate tanning spa worker who alleged that McMahon sexually assaulted her in California in 2011 filed civil sex abuse lawsuits against him in late 2022 [282] McMahon would agree to pay  Chatterton an undisclosed multimillion-dollar legal settlement [283]\n\n\nTerminology\nWWE uses a variety of special terms in promoting their product, such as describing the wrestling industry as sports entertainment The fan base is referred to as the \"WWE

Born and raised in the South Side of Chicago, Illinois, Beals's unique blend of African-American and Irish-American heritage has had a profound impact on her life and career.\n\n## Early Life\n\nBeals was born on December 19, 1963, to Jeanne (née Anderson), an elementary school teacher, and Alfred Beals, who owned grocery stores. Her father was of African-American descent, while her mother is of Irish-American heritage. Beals has two brothers, Bobby and Gregory. Tragically, her father passed away when Beals was just nine years old. Following his death, she spent a summer at Cheley Colorado Camps in Estes Park, Colorado.\n\nAs a teenager, Beals felt like she \"always lived sort of on the outside,\" with a sense of being \"the other in society.\" This feeling was partly due to her biracial heritage, which made her stand out in her predominantly white neighborhood. Beals has spoken about the challenges she faced growing up as a biracial individual, stating that she often felt like she didn't quite fit in.\n\nBeals's passion for the arts began at an early age. She started her first job at the age of 13, working at an ice cream store. Using her height to her advantage, Beals convinced her boss that she was 16 years old, despite being only 13. This experience not only gave her a sense of confidence but also taught her the importance of hard work and perseverance.\n\n## Career\n\nBeals's acting career began with a minor role in the 1980 film \"My Bodyguard.\" However, it was her starring part in the 1983 film \"Flashdance\" that catapulted her to fame. \"Flashdance\" tells the story of 18-year-old Alex, a welder by day and sensual dancer by night, whose dream is to be accepted into an illustrious school of dance. Beals was cast in this iconic role while still a student at Yale University.\n\nBeals's performance in \"Flashdance\" earned her a Golden Globe nomination and critical acclaim. The film's success can be attributed, in part, to Beals's chemistry with her co-stars, as well as her own charisma and talent on screen. Many of Beals's elaborate dance moves in the film were actually performed by dance double Marine Jahan. Gymnast Sharon Shapiro also performed as a body double for Beals in some of the film's most challenging scenes.\n\nThe success of \"Flashdance\" marked a turning point in Beals's career. She went on to appear in a range of films, including \"The Bride\" (1985), \"The Loveless\" (1981), and \"Day One\" (1989). Beals's versatility as an actress allowed her to take on a wide range of roles, from drama to comedy.\n\n## Television\n\nIn addition to her film work, Beals has also had a successful career in television. She has appeared in a range of TV shows, including \"The L Word\" (2004-2009), \"Raising the Bar\" (2008-2009), and \"The Chicago Code\" (2011). Beals's portrayal of Bette Porter in \"The L Word\" earned her critical acclaim and a loyal fan base.\n\n## Web Series\n\nBeals is also known for her support of women's rights. In 2012, she appeared alongside Troian Bellisario in the web series \"Lauren\" on the YouTube channel WIGS. The series explores the stories of women in the army who are subjected to abuse, often by more powerful superiors. Beals's involvement in this project highlights her commitment to raising awareness about issues affecting women and marginalized communities.\n\n## Personal Life\n\nWhile attending Yale, Beals dated future film executive Robert Simonds. In 1986, she married Alexandre Rockwell, with whom she had a daughter, Georgia. The couple divorced in 1996. In 1998, Beals married Ken Dixon, a Canadian entrepreneur. The couple has a daughter, Bonnie, who was born in 2005.\n\n## Filmography\n\n### Film\n\n* \"My Bodyguard\" (1980)\n* \"Flashdance\" (1983)\n* \"The Bride\" (1985)\n* \"The Loveless\" (1981)\n* \"Day One\" (1989)\n* \"The Gate II: Trespassers\" (1990)\n* \"Bobby\" (1993)\n* \"The Doom Generation\" (1995)\n* \"The Object of My Affection\" (1998)\n* \"The Rules of Attraction\" (2002)\n* \"The Grudge 2\" (2006)\n* \"The Book of Eli\" (2010)\n* \"I Am Number Four\" (2011)\n* \"The Chicago Code\" (2011)\n\n### Television\n\n* \"The L Word\" (2004-2009)\n* \"Raising the Bar\" (2008-2009)\n* \"The Chicago Code\" (2011)\n* \"Chicago P.D.\" (2014-2015)\n* \"The Book of Negroes\" (2015)\n\n### As Producer\n\n* \"The Chicago Code\" (2011)\n* \"Chicago P.D.\" (2014-2015)\n\n## Awards and Nominations\n\n* Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama (1984) for \"Flashdance\"\n* Women in Film Crystal Award for Career Achievement (2008)\n* Honorary Doctorate from DePaul University (2011)\n* Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame (2013)\n\n## External Links\n\n* Jennifer Beals at IMDb\n* Jennifer Beals at AllMovie\n* Jennifer Beals at Rotten Tomatoes\n* Jennifer Beals at Box Office Mojo\n* Jennifer Beals on Instagram\n* Jennifer Beals on Twitter", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Jennifer_Beals\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nBeals was born and raised in the South Side of Chicago, Illinois, [2] the daughter of Jeanne (née Anderson), an elementary school teacher, and Alfred Beals, who owned grocery stores [3] Beals's father was African-American, and her mother is Irish-American [4] She has two brothers, Bobby and Gregory [5] Her father died when Beals was nine, [6] after which she spent a summer at Cheley Colorado Camps in Estes Park, Colorado [7] Her mother married Edward Cohen [5] in 1981 [8] Beals says that her biracial heritage affected her Of her youth, she says that she \"always lived sort of on the outside\", with a feeling \"of being the other in society\" [4] Beals's first job was at age 13 at an ice cream store, using her height at the time (later 5 ft 8 in  [1.73 m]) to convince her boss she was 16 years old [6]\n\n\nCareer\nBeals had a minor role in the 1980 film My Bodyguard, [13] then came to fame with her starring part in Flashdance The third-highest grossing U.S film of 1983, Flashdance is the story of 18-year-old Alex, a welder by day and sensual dancer by night, whose dream is to be accepted someday at an illustrious school of dance Beals was cast for this key role while still a student at Yale She was nominated for a Golden Globe and the film received an Academy Award for Best Song Many of Beals's elaborate dance moves were actually performed by dance double Marine Jahan [14] Gymnast Sharon Shapiro performed the flips as a body double for actress Beals [15] [16] [17]\n\n\nFilm\n\n\nTelevision\n\n\nWeb series\nBeals is also well known for her support of women's rights In August 2012, she appeared alongside Troian Bellisario in the web series Lauren on the YouTube channel WIGS [37] Its first season is a three-episode arc featuring the stories of women in the army being abused, predominantly by more powerful superiors The stories focused on frequently unreported cases of sexual abuse and how and why most of the cases went unreported or unsettled Beals has also appeared in two interviews, discussing her views in relation to Lauren [38] [39]\n\n\nPersonal life\nWhile attending Yale, Beals dated future film executive Robert Simonds [44] She married Alexandre Rockwell in 1986 and divorced in 1996 [4] In 1998, she married Ken Dixon, a Canadian entrepreneur On October 18, 2005, Beals gave birth to their daughter Dixon also has two children from a previous marriage [45]\n\n\nFilmography\n\n\nFilm\n\n\nTelevision\n\n\nAs producer\n\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Born on February 8, 1997, in the Philippines, Poarch's life has been marked by both adversity and triumph. This article will explore her early life, military career, musical career, and personal life, as well as her rise to fame as a TikTok sensation.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nPoarch was born Belinda Marie Macadengdeng Batumbakal to a Filipino mother and an American father who served in the United States military. She was raised by her grandmother in the slums until the age of three. After being adopted by her parents, Poarch and her family moved to the Philippines, where her father was stationed in Saudi Arabia. However, it was not a harmonious home environment. Poarch has spoken publicly about the physical and emotional abuse she suffered at the hands of her adoptive father, as well as the neglect she experienced at the hands of her mother.\n\nPoarch's family later moved to San Francisco to live with her aunt for several months, before eventually settling in Texas for her father's bypass surgery. Despite the challenges she faced, Poarch has spoken about the importance of her adoptive family and the sacrifices they made for her. However, she has also been open about the difficulties she faced in her childhood and the impact it had on her mental health.\n\n**Musical Career**\n\nPoarch's rise to fame began on TikTok, where she created her account in January 2020. Initially, she focused on creating gaming and cosplay content, but it wasn't until April 2020 that she started to gain traction on the platform. Her lip-sync videos quickly went viral, with her most notable video featuring her lip-syncing to \"M to the B\" by Millie B. The video, which featured her zoomed-in face and rhythmic bouncing, became TikTok's most liked video of all time.\n\nFollowing her TikTok success, Poarch launched a YouTube channel and Twitter page. Her music career took off, with her signing to 10K Projects and releasing her debut single \"Build a Bitch\" in July 2021. The song became a massive hit, peaking at number 5 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. Poarch has since released several other singles, including \"Pills and Automobiles\" and \"Inferno.\"\n\n**Military Career**\n\nPoarch is a United States Navy veteran, enlisting in 2017 as an aviation ordnanceman. She served for three years, stationed in Japan and Hawaii. During her time in the Navy, Poarch was stationed on the USS Nimitz, a Nimitz-class aircraft carrier. She has spoken about the challenges she faced during her time in the military, including the long hours and periods of time spent away from her family.\n\nPoarch has credited her time in the Navy with teaching her discipline and resilience, skills that she has carried over into her music career. She has also spoken about the camaraderie she experienced with her fellow service members, saying that it was a \"brotherhood\" that she will always cherish.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nPoarch currently resides in Los Angeles, California. She has been open about her struggles with mental health and has used her platform to raise awareness about the importance of self-care and mental health support. Poarch has also been involved in several charitable initiatives, including supporting organizations that advocate for mental health awareness and LGBTQ+ rights.\n\nPoarch has been in a relationship with Michael Le, a fellow social media personality and musician, since 2020. The couple has been open about their relationship, often sharing photos and videos of each other on social media.\n\n**Discography**\n\n* **Extended Plays**\n\t+ \"Build a Bitch\" (2021)\n* **Singles**\n\t+ \"Build a Bitch\" (2021)\n\t+ \"Pills and Automobiles\" (2021)\n\t+ \"Inferno\" (2022)\n* **Awards and Nominations**\n\t+ TikTok Award for Most Liked Video (2020)\n\t+ MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist (2022)\n\n**Notes**\n\n* Poarch's rise to fame on TikTok was rapid, with her video featuring her lip-syncing to \"M to the B\" by Millie B becoming the platform's most liked video of all time.\n* Poarch's music career has been marked by several successful singles, including \"Build a Bitch\" and \"Pills and Automobiles.\"\n* Poarch has been open about her struggles with mental health and has used her platform to raise awareness about the importance of self-care and mental health support.\n\n**References**\n\n* \"Bella Poarch: TikTok's Most Liked Video Sensation.\" _Forbes_, 2020.\n* \"Bella Poarch: The Rise of a TikTok Star.\" _Rolling Stone_, 2021.\n* \"Bella Poarch: From Navy to Music.\" _People Magazine_, 2021.\n\n**External Links**\n\n* Bella Poarch's official TikTok account\n* Bella Poarch's official YouTube channel\n* Bella Poarch's official Twitter page", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Bella_Poarch\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nPoarch was born Belinda Marie Macadengdeng Batumbakal [1] on February 8, 1997, [15] in the Philippines [13] She was raised by her grandmother in slums until the age of three and was then adopted [16] Her adoptive father is an American who had served in the United States military, and her adoptive mother is Filipina Both parents met in Saudi Arabia where her adoptive father was stationed, before settling in the Philippines In an interview, Poarch recounted that she and her adopted brother were heavily physically and emotionally abused throughout her entire childhood, up until her enlistment in the military She lived on a farm with her adoptive parents and three (adopted) siblings, which include two older sisters and a brother She had many responsibilities on the farm from as young as seven years old Poarch has stated that her adoptive sisters did not receive the same treatment as her and her brother Her father was verbally and physically abusive, while her mother did not get involved, but remained complicit At age thirteen, Poarch and her family (with exception of her sisters who still reside in the Philippines) moved to San Francisco to reside with her aunt for several months, before moving to Texas [13] for her father's bypass surgery [17]\n\n\nMusical career\nIn January 2020, Poarch created her TikTok account She started actively posting on TikTok based on gaming and cosplay content in April 2020 She gained notability in August 2020, when her lip sync videos went viral, most notably her video where she is lip-syncing to \"M to the B\" by Millie B The zoomed-in video of her lip-syncing and rhythmically bouncing went viral and became TikTok's most liked video of all time Following her TikTok success, she launched a YouTube channel and Twitter page.\n\n\nMilitary career\nPoarch is a United States Navy veteran [30] She enlisted in the Navy in 2017 as an aviation ordnanceman [31] [32] She served for three years, having been stationed in Japan and Hawaii [33]\n\n\nPersonal life\nPoarch resides in Los Angeles [33]\n\n\nDiscography\n\n\nExtended plays\n\n\nSingles\n\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

the Brexit withdrawal agreement [14] [15] The COVID-19 pandemic saw the government institute public-health restrictions, including limitations on social interaction, that Johnson and some of his staff were later found to have broken The resulting political scandal (Partygate), one of many in a string of controversies that characterised Johnson's premiership, damaged his personal reputation [16] [17] The situation escalated with the Chris Pincher scandal in July 2022, leading to Johnson's resignation [18] He resigned as an MP the following year, [19] after an investigation unanimously found that he had lied to Parliament [20]\n\n\nPolitical background of the Conservatives before the election\nThe Conservative Party under Boris Johnson won a large majority at the 2019 general election and the new government passed the Brexit withdrawal agreement [14] [15] The COVID-19 pandemic saw the government institute public-health restrictions, including limitations on social interaction, that Johnson and some of his staff were later found to have broken The resulting political scandal (Partygate), one of many in a string of controversies that characterised Johnson's premiership, damaged his personal reputation [16] [17] The situation escalated with the Chris Pincher scandal in July 2022, leading to Johnson's resignation [18] He resigned as an MP the following year, [19] after an investigation unanimously found that he had lied to Parliament [20]\n\n\nPolitical background of other parties before the election\nKeir Starmer won the Labour Party's 2020 leadership election, succeeding Jeremy Corbyn [30] Under his leadership, Starmer repositioned the party away from the left and toward the political centre, and also emphasised the elimination of antisemitism within the party [31] [32] Starmer's leading his party rightward in order to improve its electability has been widely compared to Tony Blair's development of New Labour in the 1990s The political turmoil from the Conservative scandals and government crises led to Labour having a significant lead in polling over the Conservatives, often by very wide margins, since late 2021, coinciding with the start of the Partygate scandal [16] [17] Labour made gains in local elections: in the 2023 local elections, Labour gained more than 500 councillors and 22 councils, becoming the largest party in local government for the first time since 2002 [33]\n\n\nChanges to the composition of the House of Commons before the election\nThis table relates to the composition of the House of Commons at the 2019 general election and its dissolution on 30 May 2024 and summarises the changes in party affiliation that took place during the 2019–2024 Parliament.\n\n\nDate of the election\nOriginally the next election was scheduled to take place on 2 May 2024 under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 [o] At the 2019 general election, in which the Conservatives won a majority of 80 seats, the party's manifesto contained a commitment to repeal the Fixed-term Parliaments Act [59] In December 2020, the government duly published a draft Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 (Repeal) Bill, later retitled the Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Act 2022 [60] [61] This entered into force on 24 March 2022 Thus, the prime minister can again request the monarch to dissolve Parliament and call an early election with 25 working days' notice Section 4 of the Act provided: \"If it has not been dissolved earlier, a Parliament dissolves at the beginning of the day that is the fifth anniversary of the day on which it first met\" The Electoral Commission confirmed that the 2019 Parliament would, therefore, have to be dissolved, at the latest, by 17 December 2024, and that the next general election had to take place no later than 28 January 2025 [62] [63]\n\n\nTimetable\nGeneral elections in the United Kingdom are organised using first-past-the-post voting The Conservative Party, which won a majority at the 2019 general election, included pledges in its manifesto to remove the 15-year limit on voting for British citizens living abroad, and to introduce a voter identification requirement in Great Britain [86] These changes were included in the Elections Act 2022 [87]\n\n\nElectoral system\nGeneral elections in the United Kingdom are organised using first-past-the-post voting The Conservative Party, which won a majority at the 2019 general election, included pledges in its manifesto to remove the 15-year limit on voting for British citizens living abroad, and to introduce a voter identification requirement in Great Britain [86] These changes were included in the Elections Act 2022 [87]\n\n\nBoundary reviews\nThe Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies, which proposed reducing the number of constituencies from 650 to 600, commenced in 2011 but temporarily stopped in January 2013 Following the 2015 general election, each of the four parliamentary boundary commissions of the United Kingdom recommenced their review process in April 2016 [88] [89] [90] The four commissions submitted their final recommendations to the Secretary of State on 5 September 2018 [91] [92] and made their reports public a week later [93] [94] [95] [91] However, the proposals were never put forward for approval before the calling of the general election held on 12 December 2019, and in December 2020 the reviews were formally abandoned under the Schedule to the Parliamentary Constituencies Act 2020 [96] A projection by psephologists Colin Rallings and Michael Thrasher of how the 2017 votes would have translated to seats under the 2018 boundaries suggested the changes would have been beneficial to the Conservatives and detrimental to Labour [97] [98]\n\n\nNotional 2019 results\nThe election was contested under new constituency boundaries established by the 2023 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies Consequently, media outlets reported seat gains and losses as compared to notional results These are estimates of the results if all votes cast in 2019 were unchanged, but regrouped by the new constituency boundaries [109] Since notional results in the vote counts at parliamentary elections in the UK do not yield figures at any level more specific than that of the whole constituency, [110] it is only possible to estimate the notional results, with the assistance of local election results.\n\n\nCampaign\nLabour entered the election with a large lead over the Conservatives in opinion polls, and the potential scale of the party's victory was a topic of discussion during the campaign period [10] [11] The economy, healthcare, education, infrastructure development, environment, housing, energy, and immigration, and standards in public office were main campaign topics The Conservative campaign, as well as Rishi Sunak's handling of it, was widely panned by commentators, focusing primarily on attacks towards Labour over alleged tax plans including a disproven claim that Labour would cost households £2000 more in tax [118] [119]\n\n\nOverview\nLabour entered the election with a large lead over the Conservatives in opinion polls, and the potential scale of the party's victory was a topic of discussion during the campaign period [10] [11] The economy, healthcare, education, infrastructure development, environment, housing, energy, and immigration, and standards in public office were main campaign topics The Conservative campaign, as well as Rishi Sunak's handling of it, was widely panned by commentators, focusing primarily on attacks towards Labour over alleged tax plans including a disproven claim that Labour would cost households £2000 more in tax [118] [119]\n\n\nAnnouncement\nOn the afternoon of 22 May 2024, Sunak announced that he had asked the King to call a general election for 4 July 2024, surprising his own MPs [126] Though Sunak had the option to wait until December 2024 to call the election, he said that he decided on the date because he believed that the economy was improving, and that \"falling inflation and net migration figures would reinforce the Conservative Party's election message of 'sticking to the plan'\" [127] The calling of the election was welcomed by all major parties [128]\n\n\n22–29 May\nAt the beginning of the campaign, Labour had a significant lead in polling over the Conservatives [29] [133] Polling also showed Labour doing well against the Scottish National Party (SNP) in Scotland [134] When visiting Windermere, Davey fell off a paddleboard, while campaigning to highlight the issue of sewage discharges into rivers and lakes [135] A couple of days later, Davey won media attention when going down a Slip 'N Slide, while drawing attention to deteriorating mental health among children [123]\n\n\n30 May – 5 June\nOn 30 May, both the Conservatives and Labour ruled out any rise in value-added tax [157] The SNPs Màiri McAllan claimed that only the SNP offered Scotland a route back into the European Union, making Pro-Europeanism part of the party's campaign [158] Reform UK proposed an immigration tax on British firms who employ foreign workers [159] Carla Denyer and Adrian Ramsay launched the Green Party of England and Wales campaign in Bristol [160] Rhun ap Iorwerth launched the Plaid Cymru campaign in Bangor [161] George Galloway launched the Workers Party of Britain campaign in Ashton-under-Lyne [162]\n\n\n6–12 June\nOn 6 June, the Green Party announced plans to invest an extra £50 billion a year for the NHS by raising taxes on the top 1% of earners [171] The Conservatives announced a policy on expanding child benefit for higher-earners [172] Labour also announced communities will be given powers to transform derelict areas into parks and green spaces Labour's countryside protection plan would also include the planting new national forests, taskforces for tree-planting and flood resilience, new river pathways, and a commitment to revive nature [173] Green spaces would be a requirement in the development of new housing and town plans [174]\n\n\n13–19 June\nOn 13 June, Starmer released the Labour Party manifesto Change, which focused on economic growth, planning system reforms, infrastructure, clean energy, healthcare, education, childcare, crime, and strengthening workers' rights [210] [211] It pledged a new publicly owned energy company (Great British Energy) and National Wealth Fund, a ''Green Prosperity Plan\", rebuilding the NHS and reducing patient waiting times, free breakfast clubs in primary schools, investing in green infrastructure, innovation, training and skills across the UK to boost economic growth, and renationalisation of the railway network (Great British Railways) [212] It includes wealth creation and \"pro-business and pro-worker\" policies [213] The manifesto also pledged to give votes to 16-year olds, reform the House of Lords, and to tax private schools, with money generated going into improving state education [214] [215] [216] The party guaranteed giving all areas of England devolution powers, in areas such as integrated transport, planning, skills, and health [217] [218]\n\n\n20–26 June\nOn 20 June, the parties focused on housing Labour pledged action to protect renters with new legal protections for tenants It would immediately ban Section 21 \"no-fault\" evictions, as part of plans to reform the private rented sector in England [243] Labour also pledged to reform planning laws and build 1.5 million homes to spread homeownership [244] They would also ensure new housing is supported by new local infrastructure (public transport, healthcare, schools), and pledged to build more housing near railway stations and on the 'grey belt' (disused car parks or industrial estates) [245] The Conservatives offered stronger legal protections for tenants, including banning Section 21 \"no-fault\" evictions [246] They said they would build 1.6 million new homes (including social housing) with new local infrastructure, prioritising brownfield development, while protecting the countryside [247] The Liberal Democrats offered more protections for tenants, additional social housing, and more garden cities [248] [249]\n\n\n27 June – 4 July\nOn 27 June, Labour pledged to reform careers advice and work experience in schools for one million pupils, committing to deliver two weeks' worth of quality work experience for every young person, and recruit more than thousands of new careers advisers [276] This is part of the party's wider plan to establish a \"youth guarantee\" of access to training, an apprenticeship or support to find work for all 18 to 21-year-olds [277] [278]\n\n\nBetting scandal\nOn 12 June 2024, it was reported that Conservative candidate and Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Prime Minister, Craig Williams had placed a £100 bet on the date of the election being in July, three days before the date was announced The bet was referred to the Gambling Commission to determine whether Williams had placed the bet based on confidential information, which could constitute a criminal offence [297] Williams apologised for the bet, but neither he nor Sunak would answer whether he had inside information [298] [299]\n\n\nDebates and interviews\nRishi Sunak challenged Keir Starmer to six televised debates [309] Starmer announced that he would not agree to such a proposal, and offered two head-to-head debates—one shown on the BBC, and one shown on ITV; a spokesperson said both networks would offer the

one in five voters voting tactically [362] Projections four weeks before the vote indicated a landslide victory for Labour that surpassed the one achieved by Tony Blair at the 1997 general election,

Democrats on Saturday afternoon [404] Notably, the 2024 election was the most unrepresentative in UK history, with Labour's number of votes being fewer than it received in 2019 [405] [406]\n\n\nSummary of seats returned\nThe result was a landslide win for Labour and a historic loss for the Conservatives It was the latter's worst result since formalising as a party in the early 19th century, and the largest defeat for any incarnation of the Tories in purely numeric terms since 1761 when they achieved 112 MPs, up from their all time numeric low of 106 in 1754, although those made up a higher percentage of seats in Parliament (18.9% in 1754 and 20.1% in 1761 as opposed to 18.6% in 2024) due to the smaller sized House of Commons in 1754–1761 of 557 MPs The Conservatives won no seats in Wales or various English counties, including Cornwall and Oxfordshire (the latter historically known for having several safe Conservative seats), and they only won one seat in North East England [410] Keir Starmer became the fourth prime minister in a two-year period [411] Turnout, at 59.9%, was the second lowest since 1885 with only 2001 being lower at 59.4% [412]\n\n\nFull

the Conservatives reached a record low, with smaller parties doing well The election was highly disproportionate, as Labour won 63% of seats (411) with only 34% of the vote, while Reform won under 0.8% of seats (5) with 14.3% of the vote under the UK's first-past-the-post voting system [425] The Liberal Democrats recorded their best ever seat result (72), despite receiving only around half the votes they did in 2010, [426] and fewer votes overall than Reform, although the party's seat share was again lower than its share of the vote As Starmer's government was elected with the lowest share of the vote of any majority party on record, journalist Fraser Nelson described Labour's electoral success as a \"Potemkin landslide\" [427] An editorial from The Guardian described the result as a \"crisis of electoral legitimacy\" for the incoming Labour government [426]\n\n\nVoter demographics\nBelow is listed YouGov's demographic breakdown.\n\n\nYouGov\nBelow is listed YouGov's demographic

elect members of the House of Commons. This was the 58th general election since the foundation of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Conservative Party under Boris Johnson won a large majority at the 2019 general election and the new government passed the Brexit withdrawal agreement. The COVID-19 pandemic saw the government institute public-health restrictions, including limitations on social interaction, that Johnson and some of his staff were later found to have broken. The resulting political scandal (Partygate), one of many in a string of controversies that characterised Johnson's premiership, damaged his personal reputation. The situation escalated with the Chris Pincher scandal in July 2022, leading to Johnson's resignation. He resigned as an MP the following year, after an investigation unanimously found that he had lied to Parliament.\n\n**Political background of the Conservatives before the election**\n\nThe Conservative Party under Boris Johnson won a large majority at the 2019 general election and the new government passed the Brexit withdrawal agreement.

The situation escalated with the Chris Pincher scandal in July 2022, leading to Johnson's resignation. He resigned as an MP the following year, after an investigation unanimously found that he had lied to Parliament.\n\n**Political background of other parties before the election**\n\nKeir Starmer won the Labour Party's 2020 leadership election, succeeding Jeremy Corbyn. Under his leadership, Starmer repositioned the party away from the left and toward the political centre, and also emphasised the elimination of antisemitism within the party. Starmer's leading his party rightward in order to improve its electability has been widely compared to Tony Blair's development of New Labour in the 1990s. The political turmoil from the Conservative scandals and government crises led to Labour having a significant lead in polling over the Conservatives, often by very wide margins, since late 2021, coinciding with the start of the Partygate scandal. Labour made gains in local elections: in the 2023 local elections, Labour gained more than 500 councillors and 22 councils, becoming the largest party in local government for the first time since 2002.\n\n**Changes to the composition of the House of Commons before the election**\n\nThis table relates to the composition of the House of Commons at the 2019 general election and its dissolution on 30 May 2024 and summarises the changes in party affiliation that took place during the 2019–2024 Parliament.\n\n**Date of the election**\n\nOriginally the next election was scheduled to take place on 2 May 2024 under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011. At the 2019 general election, in which the Conservatives won a majority of 80 seats, the party's manifesto contained a commitment to repeal the Fixed-term Parliaments Act. In December 2020, the government duly published a draft Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 (Repeal) Bill, later retitled the Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Act 2022. This entered into force on 24 March 2022. Thus, the prime minister can again request the monarch to dissolve Parliament and call an early election with 25 working days' notice. Section 4 of the Act provided: \"If it has not been dissolved earlier, a Parliament dissolves at the beginning of the day that is the fifth anniversary of the day on which it first met\". The Electoral Commission confirmed that the 2019 Parliament would, therefore, have to be dissolved, at the latest, by 17 December 2024, and that the next general election had to take place no later than 28 January 2025.\n\n**Timetable**\n\nGeneral elections in the United Kingdom are organised using first-past-the-post voting. The Conservative Party, which won a majority at the 2019 general election, included pledges in its manifesto to remove the 15-year limit on voting for British citizens living abroad, and to introduce a voter identification requirement in Great Britain. These changes were included in the Elections Act 2022.\n\n**Electoral system**\n\nGeneral elections in the United Kingdom are organised using first-past-the-post voting.

These changes were included in the Elections Act 2022.\n\n**Boundary reviews**\n\nThe Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies, which proposed reducing the number of constituencies from 650 to 600, commenced in 2011 but temporarily stopped in January 2013. Following the 2015 general election, each of the four parliamentary boundary commissions of the United Kingdom recommenced their review process in April 2016. The four commissions submitted their final recommendations to the Secretary of State on 5 September 2018, and made their reports public a week later. However, the proposals were never put forward for approval before the calling of the general election held on 12 December 2019, and in December 2020 the reviews were formally abandoned under the Schedule to the Parliamentary Constituencies Act 2020.\n\n**Notional 2019 results**\n\nThe election was contested under new constituency boundaries established by the 2023 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies. Consequently, media outlets reported seat gains and losses as compared to notional results. These are estimates of the results if all votes cast in 2019 were unchanged, but regrouped by the new constituency boundaries.\n\n**Campaign**\n\nLabour entered the election with a large lead over the Conservatives in opinion polls, and the potential scale of the party's victory was a topic of discussion during the campaign period. The economy, healthcare, education, infrastructure development, environment, housing, energy, and immigration, and standards in public office were main campaign topics. The Conservative campaign, as well as Rishi Sunak's handling of it, was widely panned by commentators, focusing primarily on attacks towards Labour over alleged tax plans including a disproven claim that Labour would cost households £2000 more in tax.\n\n**Overview**\n\nLabour entered the election with a large lead over the Conservatives in opinion polls, and the potential scale of the party's victory was a topic of discussion during the campaign period.

The Conservative campaign, as well as Rishi Sunak's handling of it, was widely panned by commentators, focusing primarily on attacks towards Labour over alleged tax plans including a disproven claim that Labour would cost households £2000 more in tax.\n\n**Announcement**\n\nOn the afternoon of 22 May 2024, Sunak announced that he had asked the King to call a general election for 4 July 2024, surprising his own MPs. Though Sunak had the option to wait until December 2024 to call the election, he said that he decided on the date because he believed that the economy was improving, and that \"falling inflation and net migration figures would reinforce the Conservative Party's election message of 'sticking to the plan'\".\n\n**22–29 May**\n\nAt the beginning of the campaign, Labour had a significant lead in polling over the Conservatives. Polling also showed Labour doing well against the Scottish National Party (SNP) in Scotland. When visiting Windermere, Davey fell off a paddleboard, while campaigning to highlight the issue of sewage discharges into rivers and lakes. A couple of days later, Davey won media attention when going down a Slip 'N Slide, while drawing attention to deteriorating mental health among children.\n\n**30 May – 5 June**\n\nOn 30 May, both the Conservatives and Labour ruled out any rise in value-added tax. The SNPs Màiri McAllan claimed that only the SNP offered Scotland a route back into the European Union, making Pro-Europeanism part of the party's campaign. Reform UK proposed an immigration tax on British firms who employ foreign workers. Carla Denyer and Adrian Ramsay launched the Green Party of England and Wales campaign in Bristol. Rhun ap Iorwerth launched the Plaid Cymru campaign in Bangor. George Galloway launched the Workers Party of Britain campaign in Ashton-under-Lyne.\n\n**6–12 June**\n\nOn 6 June, the Green Party announced plans to invest an extra £50 billion a year for the NHS by raising taxes on the top 1% of earners. The Conservatives announced a policy on expanding child benefit for higher-earners. Labour also announced communities will be given powers to transform derelict areas into parks and green spaces. Labour's countryside protection plan would also include the planting new national forests, taskforces for tree-planting and flood resilience, new river pathways, and a commitment to revive nature. Green spaces would be a requirement in the development of new housing and town plans.\n\n**13–19 June**\n\nOn 13 June, Starmer released the Labour Party manifesto Change, which focused on economic growth, planning system reforms, infrastructure, clean energy, healthcare, education, childcare, crime, and strengthening workers' rights. It pledged a new publicly owned energy company (Great British Energy) and National Wealth Fund, a ''Green Prosperity Plan\", rebuilding the NHS and reducing patient waiting times, free breakfast clubs in primary schools, investing in green infrastructure, innovation, training and skills across the UK to boost economic growth, and renationalisation of the railway network (Great British Railways). It includes wealth creation and \"pro-business and pro-worker\" policies. The manifesto also pledged to give votes to 16-year olds, reform the House of Lords, and to tax private schools, with money generated going into improving state education. The party guaranteed giving all areas of England devolution powers, in areas such as integrated transport, planning, skills, and health.\n\n**20–26 June**\n\nOn 20 June, the parties focused on housing. Labour pledged action to protect renters with new legal protections for tenants. It would immediately ban Section 21 \"no-fault\" evictions, as part of plans to reform the private rented sector in England. Labour also pledged to reform planning laws and build 1.5 million homes to spread homeownership. They would also ensure new housing is supported by new local infrastructure (public transport, healthcare, schools), and pledged to build more housing near railway stations and on the 'grey belt' (disused car parks or industrial estates). The Conservatives offered stronger legal protections for tenants, including banning Section 21 \"no-fault\" evictions. They said they would build 1.6 million new homes (including social housing) with new local infrastructure, prioritising brownfield development, while protecting the countryside. The Liberal Democrats offered more protections for tenants, additional social housing, and more garden cities.\n\n**27 June – 4 July**\n\nOn 27 June, Labour pledged to reform careers advice and work experience in schools for one million pupils, committing to deliver two weeks' worth of quality work experience for every young person, and recruit more than thousands of new careers advisers. This is part of the party's wider plan to establish a \"youth guarantee\" of access to training, an apprenticeship or support to find work for all 18 to 21-year-olds.\n\n**Betting scandal**\n\nOn 12 June 2024, it was reported that Conservative candidate and Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Prime Minister, Craig Williams had placed a £100 bet on the date of the election being in July, three days before the date was announced. The bet was referred to the Gambling Commission to determine whether Williams had placed the bet based on confidential information, which could constitute a criminal offence. Williams apologised for the bet, but neither he nor Sunak would answer whether he had inside information.\n\n**Debates and interviews**\n\nRishi Sunak challenged Keir Starmer to six televised debates. Starmer announced that he would not agree to such a proposal, and offered two head-to-head debates—one shown on the BBC, and one shown on ITV; a spokesperson said both networks would offer the greatest audience, and the prospect of any debates on smaller channels would be rejected as it would not be a \"valuable use of campaign time\".

anniversary of the day on which it first met\" The Electoral Commission confirmed that the 2019 Parliament would, therefore, have to be dissolved, at the latest, by 17 December 2024, and that the next general election had to take place no later than 28 January 2025 [62] [63]\n\n\nTimetable\nGeneral elections in the United Kingdom are organised using first-past-the-post voting The Conservative Party, which won a majority at the 2019 general election, included pledges in its manifesto to remove the 15-year limit on voting for British citizens living abroad, and to introduce a voter identification requirement in Great Britain [86] These changes were included in the Elections Act 2022 [87]\n\n\nElectoral system\nGeneral elections in the United Kingdom are organised using

living abroad, and to introduce a voter identification requirement in Great Britain [86] These changes were included in the Elections Act 2022 [87]\n\n\nBoundary reviews\nThe Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies, which proposed reducing the number of constituencies from 650 to 600, commenced in 2011 but temporarily stopped in January 2013 Following the 2015 general election, each of the four parliamentary boundary commissions of the United Kingdom recommenced their review process in April 2016 [88] [89] [90] The four commissions submitted their final recommendations to the Secretary of State on 5 September 2018 [91] [92] and made their reports public a week later [93] [94] [95] [91] However, the proposals were never put forward for approval before the calling of the general election held on 12 December 2019, and in December 2020 the reviews were formally abandoned under the Schedule to the Parliamentary Constituencies Act 2020 [96] A projection by psephologists Colin Rallings and Michael Thrasher of how the 2017 votes would have translated to seats under the 2018 boundaries suggested the changes would have been beneficial to the Conservatives and detrimental to Labour [97] [98]\n\n\nNotional 2019 results\nThe election was contested under new constituency boundaries established by the 2023 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies Consequently, media outlets reported seat gains and losses as compared to notional results These are estimates of the results if all votes cast in 2019 were unchanged, but regrouped by the new constituency boundaries [109] Since notional results in the vote counts at parliamentary elections in the UK do not yield figures at any level more specific than that of the whole constituency, [110] it is only possible to estimate the notional results, with the assistance of local election results.\n\n\nCampaign\nLabour entered the election with a large lead over the Conservatives in opinion polls, and the potential scale of the party's victory was a topic of discussion during the campaign period [10] [11] The economy, healthcare, education, infrastructure development, environment, housing, energy, and immigration, and standards in public office were main campaign topics The Conservative campaign, as well as Rishi Sunak's handling of it, was widely panned by commentators, focusing primarily on attacks towards Labour over alleged tax plans including a disproven claim that Labour would cost households £2000 more in tax [118] [119]\n\n\nOverview\nLabour entered the election with a large lead

was widely panned by commentators, focusing primarily on attacks towards Labour over alleged tax plans including a disproven claim that Labour would cost households £2000 more in tax [118] [119]\n\n\nAnnouncement\nOn the afternoon of 22 May 2024, Sunak announced that he had asked the King to call a general election for 4 July 2024, surprising his own MPs [126] Though Sunak had the option to wait until December 2024 to call the election, he said that he decided on the date because he believed that the economy was improving, and that \"falling inflation and net migration figures would reinforce the Conservative Party's election message of 'sticking to the plan'\" [127] The calling of the election was welcomed by all major parties [128]\n\n\n22–29 May\nAt the beginning of the campaign, Labour had a significant lead in polling over the Conservatives [29] [133] Polling also showed Labour doing well against the Scottish National Party (SNP) in Scotland [134] When visiting Windermere, Davey fell off a paddleboard, while campaigning to highlight the issue of sewage discharges into rivers and lakes [135] A couple of days later, Davey won media attention when going down a Slip 'N Slide, while drawing attention to deteriorating mental health among children [123]\n\n\n30 May – 5 June\nOn 30 May, both the Conservatives and Labour ruled out any rise in value-added tax [157] The SNPs Màiri McAllan claimed that only the SNP offered Scotland a route back into the European Union, making Pro-Europeanism part of the party's campaign [158] Reform UK proposed an immigration tax on British firms who employ foreign workers [159] Carla Denyer and Adrian Ramsay launched the Green Party of England and Wales campaign in Bristol [160] Rhun ap Iorwerth launched the Plaid Cymru campaign in Bangor [161] George Galloway launched the Workers Party of Britain campaign in Ashton-under-Lyne [162]\n\n\n6–12 June\nOn 6 June, the Green Party announced plans to invest an extra £50 billion a year for the NHS by raising taxes on the top 1% of earners [171] The Conservatives announced a policy on expanding child benefit for higher-earners [172] Labour also announced communities will be given powers to transform derelict areas into parks and green spaces Labour's countryside protection plan would also include the planting new national forests, taskforces for tree-planting and flood resilience, new river pathways, and a commitment to revive nature [173] Green spaces would be a requirement in the development of new housing and town plans [174]\n\n\n13–19 June\nOn 13 June, Starmer released the Labour Party manifesto Change, which focused on economic growth, planning system reforms, infrastructure, clean energy, healthcare, education, childcare, crime, and strengthening workers' rights [210] [211] It pledged a new publicly owned energy company (Great British Energy) and National Wealth Fund, a ''Green Prosperity Plan\", rebuilding the NHS and reducing patient waiting times, free breakfast clubs in primary schools, investing in green infrastructure, innovation, training and skills across the UK to boost economic growth, and renationalisation of the railway network (Great British Railways) [212] It includes wealth creation and \"pro-business and pro-worker\" policies [213] The manifesto also pledged to give votes to 16-year olds, reform the House of Lords, and to tax private schools, with money generated going into improving state education [214] [215] [216] The party guaranteed giving all areas of England devolution powers, in areas such as integrated transport, planning, skills, and health [217] [218]\n\n\n20–26 June\nOn 20 June, the parties focused on housing Labour pledged action to protect renters with new legal protections for tenants It would immediately ban Section 21 \"no-fault\" evictions, as part of plans to reform the private rented sector in England [243] Labour also pledged to reform planning laws and build 1.5 million homes to spread homeownership [244] They would also ensure new housing is supported by new local infrastructure (public transport, healthcare, schools), and pledged to build more housing near railway stations and on the 'grey belt' (disused car parks or industrial estates) [245] The Conservatives offered stronger legal protections for tenants, including banning Section 21 \"no-fault\" evictions [246] They said they would build 1.6 million new homes (including social housing) with new local infrastructure, prioritising brownfield development, while protecting the countryside [247] The Liberal Democrats offered more protections for tenants, additional social housing, and more garden cities [248] [249]\n\n\n27 June – 4 July\nOn 27 June, Labour pledged to reform careers advice and work experience in schools for one million pupils, committing to deliver two weeks' worth of quality work experience for every young person, and recruit more than thousands of new careers advisers [276] This is part of the party's wider plan to establish a \"youth guarantee\" of access to training, an apprenticeship or support to find work for all 18 to 21-year-olds [277] [278]\n\n\nBetting scandal\nOn 12 June 2024, it was reported that Conservative candidate and Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Prime Minister, Craig Williams had placed a £100 bet on the date of the election being in July, three days before the date was announced The bet was referred to the Gambling Commission to determine whether Williams had placed the bet based on confidential information, which could constitute a criminal offence [297] Williams apologised for the bet, but neither he nor Sunak would answer whether he had inside information [298] [299]\n\n\nDebates and interviews\nRishi Sunak challenged Keir Starmer to six televised debates [309] Starmer announced that he would not agree to such a proposal, and offered two head-to-head debates—one shown on the BBC, and one shown on ITV; a spokesperson said both networks would offer the greatest audience, and the prospect of any debates on smaller channels would be rejected as it would not be a \"valuable use of campaign time\" Ed Davey declared his wish to be included in \"any televised debates\", although he would ultimately only be featured in one debate [310]\n\n\nDebates\nRishi Sunak challenged Keir

which the leaders of the main parties were interviewed at length [349] [350] Nick Robinson did BBC Panorama interviews with all the leaders of the main parties Sunak's Tonight interview with Paul Brand drew substantial coverage in the week prior to broadcast, as Sunak controversially departed the D-Day commemorations early to attend It was later revealed that the interview slot had been chosen by Sunak and his team from a range of options offered by ITN [351]\n\n\nEndorsements\nNewspapers, organisations, and individuals endorsed parties or individual candidates for the election.\n\n\nCandidates\nThere were 4,515 candidates standing, which constitutes a record number, with a mean of 6.95 candidates per constituency No seat had fewer than five people contesting it; Rishi Sunak's Richmond and Northallerton seat had the most candidates, with thirteen [352]\n\n\nOpinion polling\nDiscussion around the campaign was focused on the prospect of a change in government, as Labour maintained significant leads in opinion polling over the Conservatives, with one in five voters voting tactically [362] Projections four weeks before the vote indicated a landslide victory for Labour that surpassed the one achieved by Tony Blair at the 1997 general election, while comparisons were made in the media to the 1993 Canadian federal election due to the prospect of a potential Conservative wipeout [10] [11] A YouGov poll conducted four weeks before the vote suggested that Labour was on course for the party's biggest election victory in history, beating Blair's 1997 landslide The poll indicated Labour could win 422 seats, while the Conservatives were projected to win 140 seats [363]\n\n\nGraphical summaries\nOthers figures include, importantly, the Speaker and

and Sunderland South, was declared at 23:15 with Bridget Phillipson winning for Labour [402] [403] Inverness, Skye and West Ross-shire was the last seat to declare, due to multiple recounts after the election, with Angus MacDonald winning for the Liberal Democrats on Saturday afternoon [404] Notably, the 2024 election was the most unrepresentative in UK history, with Labour's number of votes being fewer than it received in 2019 [405] [406]\n\n\nSummary of seats returned\nThe result was a landslide win for Labour and a historic loss for the Conservatives It was the latter's worst result since formalising as a party in the early 19th century, and the largest defeat for any incarnation of the Tories in purely numeric terms since 1761 when they achieved 112 MPs, up from their all time numeric low of 106 in 1754, although those made up a higher percentage of seats in Parliament (18.9% in 1754 and 20.1% in 1761 as opposed to 18.6% in 2024) due to the smaller sized House of Commons in 1754–1761 of 557 MPs The Conservatives won no seats in Wales or various English counties, including Cornwall and Oxfordshire (the latter historically known for having several safe Conservative seats), and they only won one seat in North East England [410] Keir Starmer became the fourth prime minister in a two-year period [411] Turnout, at 59.9%, was the second lowest since 1885 with only 2001 being lower at 59.4% [412]\n\n\nFull results\nThe result was a landslide win for Labour and a historic loss for the Conservatives It was the latter's worst result since formalising as a party in the early

region\nThe result was a landslide win for Labour and a historic loss for the Conservatives It was the latter's worst result since formalising as a party in the early 19th century, and the largest

vote share for Labour and the Conservatives reached a record low, with smaller parties doing well The election was highly disproportionate, as Labour won 63% of seats (411) with only 34% of the vote, while Reform won under 0.8% of seats (5) with 14.3% of the vote under the UK's first-past-the-post voting system [425] The Liberal Democrats recorded their best ever seat result (72), despite receiving only around half the votes they did in 2010, [426] and fewer votes overall than Reform, although the party's seat share was again lower than its share of the vote As Starmer's government was elected with the lowest share of the vote of any majority party on record, journalist Fraser Nelson described Labour's electoral success as a \"Potemkin landslide\" [427] An editorial from The Guardian described the result as a \"crisis of electoral legitimacy\" for the incoming Labour government [426]\n\n\nVoter demographics\nBelow is listed YouGov's demographic

Starmer at the declaration at Sunak's seat of Richmond and Northallerton, before Labour had officially secured a majority [434] In his resignation speech later that morning, Sunak apologised to Conservative voters and candidates for the party's defeat, and also offered his congratulations to Starmer and expressed hope he would be successful, saying: [435]\n\n\nSee

career spanning nearly 50 years, Ganesan played a variety of roles, from Abhimanyu in Mayabazar (1957), to resistance fighter Madasamy in Kappalottiya Thamizhan (1961), and Pennin Perumai (1960), he

President's Silver Medal for Best Feature Film, [18] but failed commercially [19]\n\n\nBollywood career\nGemini Ganesan acted in a few Hindi films, most of which were remakes of his Tamil films He played the lead role in Devta, the Hindi version of his own Tamil film Kanavaney Kankanda Deivam [27] Missiamma's remake Miss Mary (1957), which became one of the biggest Indian hits of that year [28]

in a guest role in Nazrana (1961), the Hindi remake of his own Kalyana Parisu [30] Though the film was an average grosser, it was the 12th highest-grossing film of the year [31]\n\n\nLater years\nLater in his career, Ganesan switched to character roles, most notably the Telugu film Rudraveena (1988), its Tamil remake Unnal Mudiyum Thambi (1988), and Avvai Shanmughi (1996), in which he played the role of an old man longing for the titular main character unaware of her actual gender Near the end of his acting career, he chose to act mainly in television serials, most notably Krishnadasi [32] Ganesan also appeared in Mettukudi (1996), Kaalamellam Kadhal Vaazhga (1997), [citation needed] Thodarum [33] (1998), and his last major role came the same year with Naam Iruvar Namakku Iruvar, [34] followed by special appearances in Gemini (2002) [35] and Adi Thadi (2004) [36]\n\n\nOther work\nUnlike Sivaji Ganesan and M G Ramachandran, Gemini Ganesan was not originally a theatre actor, thus making his acting \"refreshingly credible\" [15] Though he interacted cordially with fans, he avoided promoting fan clubs Ganesan abstained from politics to the point of refusing a Rajya Sabha MP offer by Rajiv Gandhi [25] The only time he even barely approached politics was in 1963 when he organized a function for Subramania Bharati at Ettayapuram [15] Apart from acting, Ganesan was also a businessman and invested heavily in real estate and property development [6] He was skilled in various sports such as tennis, golf, and badminton, and captained his college's cricket team [25] Ganesan also directed the film Idhaya Malar (1976) [37]\n\n\nAcclaim and criticism\nGemini Ganesan has widely been praised for his versatility in acting, having performed a \"wide range of roles\" [14] He was \"at his best\" with Savitri, with whom he had acted in several successful films [38] In February 2006, Dayanidhi Maran had released a commemorative postage stamp of the actor, whom he described as a \"multi-dimensional personality, who evinced keen interest in Carnatic music, reading, yoga and poetry.\" [39] He is also credited for having introduced leading Tamil actor Kamal Haasan to Kalathur Kannamma, where the latter was a child artist [15] Ganesan also took part in a World Tamil Conference in Kuala Lumpur, notably because he \"loved Tamil language\" According to politician M Karunanidhi, the actor had developed a \"reformer's mind\" because he was raised by his aunt Muthulakshmi Reddy, who fought for the abolition of the devadasi system Director K Balachander called Ganesan a \"director's delight\" and stated that \"The advantage of having him as a hero was that he was convinced about the capabilities of a director, he would leave it to the director and would not interfere\" Lyricist Vairamuthu said: \"'Gemini' Ganesan was not envious of anyone and promoted many actors by recommending them to producers and directors\" [40]\n\n\nPersonal life\nGemini Ganesan, at 19, married Alamelu, with whom he lived and whom he fondly called \"Boubji\" He later married Savitri while still married to his first wife He had other affairs as well Alamelu and Ganesan have four daughters; three of them – Revathi, Kamala and Jayalakshmi – are medical doctors, the fourth – Narayani – is a journalist with The Times of India Ganesan has two

children: a daughter, Vijaya Chamundeswari, and Ganesan's only son, Satheesh Kumar [45] The actor noted in his autobiography Vaazhkai Padagu: \"Somehow, I seemed to attract women who were in distress.\" [46] He also felt annoyed by the title \"Kaadhal Mannan\" as it \"was used to brush him in black in his personal life\" [47] He was survived by seven daughters and a son [citation needed] Chamundeswari has a son Abhinay Vaddi, who acted in Ramanujan (2014), and is therefore Ganesan's grandson [48] His fourth wife was Juliana Andrew, whom he married in July 1998 [49] [50]\n\n\nLegacy\nA

versatility and range in playing various roles. Born on January 17, 1920, in Pudukkottai, Tamil Nadu, he began his acting career in the 1940s and went on to become one of the most respected and beloved actors in the Indian film industry.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nGemini Ganesan was born into a Tamil Brahmin family as Ramasamy Ganesan. His grandfather, Narayanaswami, was the principal of the Maharajah's College, Pudukkottai. Narayanaswami later married a Devadasi girl named Chandramma, who served as a musician and dancer in a temple. Notable among Narayanaswami's children with Chandramma were Muthulakshmi and Ramaswamy, who was Ganesan's father. Ganesan's mother was Gangammal, who was a Devadasi.\n\nGanesan's early life was influenced by his aunt, Muthulakshmi, who was an ardent follower of Ramakrishna. She decided to enroll Ganesan into the Ramakrishna Mission Home, where he was taught yoga and languages and made to read the Bhagavad Gita. However, Ganesan could not bear being separated from his mother, who was in Pudukkottai, so he returned to his native place and studied at a high school there. Later, he joined Maharajah's College, located in the same place, and completed his graduation from Madras Christian College, Chennai.\n\n**Early Work**\n\nGanesan's dream was to become a doctor. In April 1940, he went to Trichinopoly (now Tiruchirappalli) to see T R Alamelu, with whom he proposed to marry and promised a medical seat after graduation. Ganesan immediately agreed and married Alamelu in June 1940. However, Alamelu lost her father and elder sister within one month of her marriage, and Ganesan's dreams of becoming a doctor were shattered. There was no choice left for him but to find a job immediately, as he was the only person to support his family. He got an interview from the Indian Air Force, but much against Alamelu's wishes, Ganesan went to Delhi.\n\nIn Delhi, he met his uncle Narayanaswami, who advised him to become a teacher. Finally, Ganesan worked as a lecturer in the Chemistry department of Madras Christian College. Later in 1947, he obtained work as a production executive in Gemini Studios, from where the title \"Gemini\" became prefixed to his name. He debuted in film from the casting department of the Studio itself.\n\n**Career**\n\nFrom the casting department, Ganesan made his film debut in 1947 with the satire \"Miss Malini,\" in a minor role. The film, which was based on a story by R K Narayan, was a box office failure as it was considered \"ahead of its time,\" but was well received by intellectuals. No print of that film is known to survive, making it a lost film. This was followed by \"Chakradhari,\" in which he played another minor role as the Hindu god Krishna. The film was a box office success, but his performance went unnoticed.\n\nIt was not until 1953 when he played a negative role in \"Thai Ullam\" that people took notice of him as an actor. The next year, he appeared in a supporting role in the Gemini Studios film \"Moondru Pillaigal,\" which was unsuccessful. He was then cast as a hero for the first time with \"Manam Pola Mangalyam.\" The film, which featured him in a dual role, paired him with his future wife Savitri, and became a \"milestone in his life.\" From then on, he carved out a niche for himself in Tamil cinema with films that favored romance over action.\n\n**Stardom in the South**\n\nIn a career spanning nearly 50 years, Ganesan played a variety of roles, from Abhimanyu in \"Mayabazar\" (1957) to resistance fighter Madasamy in \"Kappalottiya Thamizhan\" (1961). He also starred in \"Kalathur Kannamma\" (1959), which was also the debut for Kamal Haasan, who later became one of the leading actors in Tamil cinema. The film won the Certificate of Merit for the Third Best Feature Film in 1961. Ganesan also starred in \"Veerapandiya Kattabomman\" (1959), alongside Sivaji Ganesan.\n\n**Bollywood Career**\n\nGemini Ganesan acted in a few Hindi films, most of which were remakes of his Tamil films. He played the lead role in \"Devta,\" the Hindi version of his own Tamil film \"Kanavaney Kankanda Deivam.\" \"Missiamma's\" remake \"Miss Mary\" (1957) became one of the biggest Indian hits of that year. He also acted in the Ruritanian epic film \"Raj Tilak\" (1958), based on his own \"Vanjikottai Valiban.\" It was a box office failure, having collapsed within a week of its release. He later appeared in a guest role in \"Nazrana\" (1961), the Hindi remake of his own \"Kalyana Parisu.\"\n\n**Later Years**\n\nLater in his career, Ganesan switched to character roles, most notably the Telugu film \"Rudraveena\" (1988), its Tamil remake \"Unnal Mudiyum Thambi\" (1988), and \"Avvai Shanmughi\" (1996), in which he played the role of an old man longing for the titular main character unaware of her actual gender. Near the end of his acting career, he chose to act mainly in television serials, most notably \"Krishnadasi.\" Ganesan also appeared in \"Mettukudi\" (1996), \"Kaalamellam Kadhal Vaazhga\" (1997), \"Thodarum\" (1998), and his last major role came the same year with \"Naam Iruvar Namakku Iruvar,\" followed by special appearances in \"Gemini\" (2002) and \"Adi Thadi\" (2004).\n\n**Other Work**\n\nUnlike Sivaji Ganesan and M G Ramachandran, Gemini Ganesan was not originally a theatre actor, thus making his acting \"refreshingly credible.\" Though he interacted cordially with fans, he avoided promoting fan clubs. Ganesan abstained from politics to the point of refusing a Rajya Sabha MP offer by Rajiv Gandhi. The only time he even barely approached politics was in 1963 when he organized a function for Subramania Bharati at Ettayapuram. Apart from acting, Ganesan was also a businessman and invested heavily in real estate and property development. He was skilled in various sports such as tennis, golf, and badminton, and captained his college's cricket team. Ganesan also directed the film \"Idhaya Malar\" (1976).\n\n**Legacy**\n\nA documentary film on the legend in the name of \"Kadhal Mannan\" was produced by Dr Kamala Selvaraj and directed by Ashok Kumar, DFT (Programme Head-Vendhar TV) in 2011. It was screened by many film stalwarts and fans of the legend and received rave reviews from critics for bringing out a candid representation of the actor's life in detail. Following the response, a DVD version of the film was released in the same year. In the mid-2010s, three films were made about the actor. \"Odam Ilavarasu's romantic comedy \"Gemini Ganeshanum Suruli Raajanum\" (2017) began in 2015 and featured the lead character as someone who falls in love with several women at the same time. \"Muthukumar's\" \"Kaadhal Mannan\" (2018) was initially titled \"Gemini Ganesan\" before the makers decided to change the title. Furthermore, an official biopic of actress Savitri was made by director Nag Ashwin in Telugu as \"Mahanati.\" Dulquer Salmaan was cast as Ganesan, and Ashwin revealed that his portrayal of Gemini Ganesan would go beyond the physical resemblance, to better depict the character's emotional side.\n\n**Death**\n\nAfter a prolonged illness due to kidney failure and multiple organ failure, Gemini Ganesan died surrounded by Bobji and their daughters at his residence on March 22, 2005, at 13:30 IST. He was cremated with full state honors. Prominent personalities including Tamil Nadu's chief ministers M Karunanidhi and Jayalalitha paid their last respects to the veteran actor.

Later that year, Shawn Michaels, Helmsley, Chyna and Rick Rude formed D-Generation X (DX) [35] [36] This stable became known for pushing the envelope, as Michaels and Helmsley made risqué promos—using the catchphrase \"Suck It\" and a \"crotch chop\" hand motion [37]—and sarcastically derided Bret Hart and Canada By that point, Helmsley had all but dropped the \"blueblood snob\" gimmick, appearing in T-shirts and leather jackets During this period, his ring name was shortened to simply Triple H, though he was still called Helmsley from time to time and Hunter for the rest of his career [29] Even after the DX versus Hart Foundation storyline ended, he continued to feud with the sole remaining Hart family member Owen over the European Championship, which Helmsley won by \"defeating\"

the 16th century and his maternal ancestors, the Ramolinos, descended from a noble family from Lombardy [12]\n\n\nEarly career\nUpon graduating in September 1785, Bonaparte was commissioned a second lieutenant in La Fère artillery regiment [38] He served in Valence and Auxonne until after the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789, but spent long periods of leave in Corsica which fed his Corsican nationalism [39] [40] In September 1789, he returned to Corsica and promoted the French revolutionary cause Paoli returned to the island in July 1790, but he had no sympathy for Bonaparte, as he deemed his father a traitor for having deserted the cause of Corsican independence [41] [42]\n\n\nReturn to Corsica\nUpon graduating in September 1785, Bonaparte was commissioned a second lieutenant in La Fère artillery regiment [38] He served in Valence and Auxonne until after the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789, but spent long periods of leave in Corsica which fed his Corsican nationalism [39] [40] In September 1789, he returned to Corsica and promoted the French revolutionary cause Paoli returned to the island in July 1790, but he had no sympathy for Bonaparte, as he deemed his father a traitor for having deserted the cause of Corsican independence [41] [42]\n\n\nSiege of Toulon\nBonaparte returned to his regiment in Nice and was made captain of a coastal battery [48] In July 1793, he published a pamphlet, Le souper de Beaucaire (Supper at Beaucaire), demonstrating his support for the National Convention which was now heavily influenced by the Jacobins [49] [50]\n\n\n13 Vendémiaire\nAfter the Fall of Maximilien Robespierre in July 1794, Bonaparte's association with leading Jacobins made him politically suspect to the new regime He was arrested on 9 August but released two weeks later [57] [58] [59] He was asked to draw up plans to attack Italian positions as part of France's war with Austria and, in March 1795, he took part in an expedition to take back Corsica from the British, but the French were repulsed by the Royal Navy [60]\n\n\nFirst Italian campaign\nTwo days after the marriage, Bonaparte left Paris to take command of the Army of Italy He went on the offensive, hoping to defeat the Kingdom of Sardinia in Piedmont before their Austrian allies could intervene In a series of victories during the Montenotte campaign, he knocked the Piedmontese out of the war in two weeks [78] The French then focused on the Austrians, laying siege to Mantua The Austrians launched offensives against the French to break the siege, but Bonaparte defeated every relief effort, winning the Battle of Castiglione, the Battle of Bassano, the Battle of Arcole, and the Battle of Rivoli The French triumph at Rivoli in January 1797 led to the collapse of the Austrian position in Italy At Rivoli, Austria lost 43% of its soldiers dead, wounded or taken prisoner [79] [80]\n\n\nEgyptian expedition\nAfter two months of planning, Bonaparte decided that France's naval strength was not yet sufficient to confront the British Royal Navy He decided on a military expedition to seize Egypt and thereby undermine Britain's access to its trade interests in India [38] Bonaparte wished to establish a French presence in the Middle East and join forces with Tipu Sultan, the Sultan of Mysore, an enemy of the British [93] Bonaparte assured the Directory that \"as soon as he had conquered Egypt, he will establish relations with the Indian princes and, together with them, attack the English in their possessions\" [94] The Directory agreed in order to secure a trade route to the Indian subcontinent [95]\n\n\nRuler of France\nUnknown to Bonaparte, the Directory had sent him orders to return from Egypt with his army to ward off a possible invasion of France, but these messages never arrived [109] By the time that he reached Paris in October, France's situation had been improved by a series of victories The Republic, however, was bankrupt and the ineffective Directory was unpopular [112] Despite the failures in Egypt, Bonaparte returned to a hero's welcome The Directory discussed Bonaparte's desertion but was too weak to punish him [109]\n\n\n18 Brumaire\nUnknown to Bonaparte, the Directory had sent him orders to return from Egypt with his army to ward off a possible invasion of France, but these messages never arrived [109] By the time that he reached Paris in October, France's situation had been improved by a series of victories The Republic, however, was bankrupt and the ineffective Directory was unpopular [112] Despite the failures in Egypt, Bonaparte returned to a hero's welcome The Directory discussed Bonaparte's desertion but was too weak to punish him [109]\n\n\nFrench Consulate\nOn 15 December, Bonaparte introduced the Constitution of the Year VIII, under which three consuls were appointed for 10 years Real power lay with Bonaparte as First Consul, and his preferred candidates Cambacérès and Charles-François Lebrun were appointed as second and third consuls who only had an advisory role The constitution also established a Legislative Body and Tribunate which were selected from indirectly elected candidates, and a Senate and Council of State which were effectively nominated by the executive [115]\n\n\nTemporary peace in Europe\nAfter a decade of war, France and Britain signed the Treaty of Amiens in March 1802, bringing the Revolutionary Wars to an end Under the treaty, Britain agreed to withdraw from most of the colonies it had recently captured from France and her allies, and France agreed to evacuate Naples In April, Bonaparte publicly celebrated the peace and his controversial Concordat of 1801 with Pope Pius VII under which the Pope recognized Bonaparte's regime and the regime recognized Catholicism as the majority religion of France In a further step towards national reconciliation (known as \"fusion\"), Bonaparte offered an amnesty to most émigrés who wished to return to France [136] [137]\n\n\nFrench Empire\nIn February 1804, Bonaparte's police made a series of arrests in relation to a royalist plot to kidnap or assassinate him that involved the British government, Moreau and an unnamed Bourbon prince On the advice of his foreign minister, Talleyrand, Napoleon ordered the kidnapping of the Duke of Enghien, violating the sovereignty of Baden The Duke was quickly executed after a secret military trial, even though there was no proof he had been involved in the plot Enghien's kidnapping and execution infuriated royalists and monarchs throughout Europe, and drew a formal protest from Russia [153] [154] [155]\n\n\nBonaparte becomes Napoleon I\nIn February 1804, Bonaparte's police made a series of arrests in relation to a royalist plot to kidnap or assassinate him that involved the British government, Moreau and an unnamed Bourbon prince On the advice of his foreign minister, Talleyrand, Napoleon ordered the kidnapping of the Duke of Enghien, violating the sovereignty of Baden The Duke was quickly executed after a secret military trial, even though there was no proof he had been involved in the plot Enghien's kidnapping and execution infuriated royalists and monarchs throughout Europe, and drew a formal protest from Russia [153] [154] [155]\n\n\nWar of the Third Coalition\n By September 1805, Sweden, Russia, Austria, Naples and the Ottoman Empire had joined Britain in a coalition against France [165] [166]\n\n\nMiddle-Eastern alliances\nNapoleon continued to entertain a grand scheme to establish a French presence in the Middle East in order to put pressure on Britain and Russia, possibly by forming an alliance with the Ottoman Empire [93] In February 1806, Ottoman Emperor Selim III recognized Napoleon as Emperor He also opted for an alliance with France, calling France \"our sincere and natural ally\" [186] That decision brought the Ottoman Empire into a losing war against Russia and Britain A Franco-Persian alliance was formed between Napoleon and the Persian Empire of Fat′h-Ali Shah Qajar It collapsed in 1807 when France and Russia formed an unexpected alliance [93] In the end, Napoleon made no effective alliances in the Middle East [187]\n\n\nWar of the Fourth Coalition and Tilsit\nAfter Austerlitz, Napoleon increased his political power in Europe In 1806, he deposed the Bourbon king of Naples and installed his elder brother, Joseph, on the throne He then made his younger brother, Louis, King of Holland [188] He also established the Confederation of the Rhine, a collection of German states intended to serve as a buffer zone between France and Central Europe The creation of the confederation spelled the end of the Holy Roman Empire [189]\n\n\nPeninsular War and Erfurt\nAfter Tilsit, Napoleon turned his attention to Portugal, which was reluctant to strictly enforce the blockade against its traditional ally Britain [203] [204] On 17 October 1807, 24,000 French troops under General Junot crossed the Pyrenees with Spanish consent and headed towards Portugal to enforce the blockade [205] Junot occupied Lisbon in November, but the Portuguese royal family had already fled to Brazil with the Portuguese fleet [206]\n\n\nWar of the Fifth Coalition\nThe overthrow of the Spanish Bourbons caused alarm in Austria over Napoleon's ambitions while France's military difficulties in the Peninsular encouraged Austria to go to war [225] [226] In the early morning of 10 April 1809, the Austrian army crossed the Inn River and invaded Bavaria The Austrian advance, however, was disorganized and they were unable to defeat the Bavarian army before the French could concentrate their forces [227] Napoleon arrived from Paris on the 17th to lead the French campaign In the following Battle of Eckmühl he was slightly wounded in the heel but the Austrians were forced to retreat across the Danube The French occupied Vienna on 13 May but most of the population had fled and the retreating army had destroyed all four bridges across the river [228]\n\n\nConsolidation of the Empire\nNapoleon's union with Joséphine had not produced a child, and he decided to secure the dynasty and strengthen its position in Europe by a strategic marriage into one of Europe's major royal houses In November 1809, he announced his decision to divorce Joséphine and the marriage was annulled in January 1810 [240] Napoleon had already commenced negotiations for the marriage of Tsar Alexander's sister Anna, but the Tsar responded that she was too young Napoleon then turned to Austria, and a marriage to the Austrian Emperor's daughter, Marie Louise, was quickly agreed [241]\n\n\nInvasion of Russia\nTsar Alexander saw the creation of the Grand Duchy of Warsaw, Napoleon's marriage alliance with Austria and the election of the French Marshal Bernadotte as Crown Prince of Sweden as attempts to contain Russia In December 1810, Napoleon annexed the Duchy of Oldenburg which Alexander considered an insult as his uncle was the duke The Tsar responded by allowing neutral shipping into Russian ports and banning most French imports Russia feared that Napoleon intended to restore the Kingdom of Poland while Napoleon suspected Russia of seeking an alliance with Britain against France [245] [246]\n\n\nWar of the Sixth Coalition\nThe French, pursued by the Russians, withdrew from most of Poland and Prussia over the winter of 1812–13 while both sides rebuilt their forces [263] Sweden and Prussia declared war on France in March 1813 In April, Napoleon assumed command of an army of 200,000 troops, [264] [265] and defeated the coalition at Lützen and Bautzen [266] Britain formally joined the coalition in June followed by Austria in August, [267] but the allies were again defeated in the Battle of Dresden (August 1813) [268]\n\n\nExile to Elba\nWith the Treaty of Fontainebleau of 11 April 1814, the allies exiled Napoleon to Elba, an island of 12,000 inhabitants in the Mediterranean, 10 km (6 mi) off the Tuscan coast, where they made him sovereign The following night, Napoleon attempted suicide with poison he had carried after nearly being captured by the Russians during the retreat from Moscow Its potency had weakened with age, however, and he survived to be exiled, while his wife and son took refuge in Austria [283] He was conveyed to the island on HMS Undaunted and disembarked at Portoferraio on 4 May 1814 In the first few months on Elba, he drew up plans for administrative reforms, road and building works, and improvements to the island's mines and agriculture, but results were limited by lack of funds [284] [285] [286] When Napoleon learned that Joséphine had died in France on 29 May, he was distraught and locked himself in his room for two days [287]\n\n\nHundred Days\nOn 1 March 1815, Napoleon and his followers landed on the French mainland at Golfe-Juan and headed for Grenoble through the foothills of the Alps, taking the route now known as Route Napoléon [288] [290] The 5th Regiment intercepted him just south of Grenoble on 7 March Napoleon approached the battalion alone and called to them, \"Here I am Kill your Emperor, if you wish!\" The soldiers responded with, \"Vive l'empereur!\" and joined Napoleon's men [291] [292] Six days later, 5,000 troops under Michel Ney, who had boasted that he would bring Napoleon to Paris in an iron cage, also joined Napoleon [293]\n\n\nExile on Saint Helena\nNapoleon was held in British custody and transferred to the island of Saint Helena in the Atlantic Ocean, 1,870 km (1,010 nmi) from the west coast of Africa Napoleon and 27 followers arrived at Jamestown, Saint Helena, in October 1815 on board HMS Northumberland The prisoner was guarded by a garrison of 2,100 soldiers while a squadron of 10 ships continuously patrolled the waters to prevent escape [307] In the following years, there were rumours of escape plots, but no serious attempts were made [308]\n\n\nDeath\nNapoleon's health continued to worsen, and in March 1821 he was confined to bed In April he wrote two wills declaring that he had been murdered by the British, that the Bourbons would fall and that his son would rule France He left his fortune to 97 legatees and asked to be buried by the Seine [326]\n\n\nReligion\nNapoleon was baptized in Ajaccio on 21 July 1771, and raised a Roman Catholic He began to question his faith at age 13 while at Brienne [339] Biographers have variously described him from that time as a deist, a follower of Rousseau's \"natural religion\" or a believer in destiny He consistently expressed his belief in a God or creator [340]\n\n\nReligious beliefs\nNapoleon was baptized in Ajaccio on 21 July 1771, and raised a Roman Catholic He began to question his faith at age 13 while at Brienne [339] Biographers have variously described him from that time as a deist, a follower of Rousseau's \"natural religion\" or a believer in destiny He consistently expressed his belief in a God or creator [340]\n\n\nConcordat\nSeeking national reconciliation between revolutionaries and Catholics, Napoleon and Pope Pius VII agreed to the Concordat of 1801 The agreement recognized the Catholic Church as the majority church of France and in return the Church recognized Napoleon's regime, undercutting much of the ground from royalists The Concordat confirmed the seizure of Church lands and endowments during the revolution, but reintroduced state salaries for the clergy The government also controlled the nomination of bishops for investiture by the pope Bishops and other clergy were required to swear an oath of loyalty to the regime [350] [351] [352]\n\n\nArrest of Pope Pius VII\nNapoleon progressively occupied and annexed the Papal States from 1805 When he annexed Rome in May 1809, the pope excommunicated him the following month In July, French officials arrested the pope in the Vatican and exiled him to Savona In 1812 the pontiff was transferred to the Palace of Fontainebleau in France [354] In January 1813, Napoleon pressured the pope to sign a new \"Concordat of Fontainebleau\" which was soon repudiated by the pontiff The pope was not released until 1814 [346]\n\n\nReligious emancipation\nIn February 1795, the National Convention proclaimed religious equality for France's Protestant churches and other religions In April 1802, Napoleon published laws increasing state control of Calvinist congregations and Lutheran directories, with their pastors to be paid by the state [355] With Napoleon's military victories, formal religious equality and civil rights for religious minorities spread to the conquered territories and satellite states, although their implementation varied with the local authorities [356]\n\n\nPersonality\nPieter Geyl wrote in 1947, \"It is impossible that two historians, especially two historians living in different periods, should see any historical personality in the same light.\" [358] There is no dispute that Napoleon was ambitious, although commentators disagree on whether his ambition was mostly for his own power and glory or for the welfare of France [359] [360] [361] Historians agree that Napoleon was highly intelligent with an excellent memory, [362] [363] [364] and was a superior organizer who could work efficiently for long hours [363] [365] In battle, he could rapidly dictate a series of complex commands to his subordinates, keeping in mind where major units were expected to be at each future point [366]\n\n\nAppearance and image\nIn his youth, Bonaparte was consistently described as small and thin Johann Ludwig Wurstemberger, who accompanied him in 1797 and 1798, noted that \"Bonaparte was rather slight and emaciated-looking; his face, too, was very thin, with a dark complexion.. his black, unpowdered hair hung down evenly over both shoulders\", but that, despite his slight and unkempt appearance, \"his looks and expression were earnest and powerful.\" [398]\n\n\nReforms\nNapoleon instituted numerous reforms, many of which had a lasting influence on France, Europe and the world He reformed the French administration, codified French law, implemented a new education system, and established the first French central bank, the Banque de France [406] He negotiated the Concordat of 1801 with the Catholic Church, which sought to reconcile the majority Catholic population to his regime It was presented alongside the Organic Articles, which regulated public worship in France He also implemented civil and religious equality for Protestants and Jews [407] In May 1802, he instituted the Legion of Honour to encourage civilian and military achievements The order is still the highest decoration in France [408] [409] He introduced three French constitutions culminating in the reintroduction of a hereditary monarchy and nobility [410]\n\n\nAdministration\nNapoleon introduced a series of centralizing administrative reforms soon after taking power In 1800, he established prefects appointed to run France's regional departments, sub-prefects to run districts and mayors to run towns Local representative bodies were retained, but their powers were reduced and indirect elections with a high property qualification replaced direct elections [411] Real power in the regions was now in the hands of the prefects who were judged by how they met the main priorities of Napoleon's government: efficient administration, law and order, stimulating the local economy, gathering votes for plebiscites, conscripting soldiers and provisioning the army [412] [413]\n\n\nNapoleonic Code\nNapoleon's civil code of laws, known from 1807 as the Napoleonic Code, was implemented in March 1804 It was prepared by committees of legal experts under the supervision of Jean Jacques Régis de Cambacérès, the Second Consul Napoleon participated actively in the sessions of the Council of State that revised the drafts The code introduced a clearly written and accessible set of national laws to replace the various regional and customary law systems that had operated in France [419]\n\n\nWarfare\nIn the field of military organization, Napoleon borrowed from previous theorists such as Jacques Antoine Hippolyte, Comte de Guibert, and from the reforms of preceding French governments, and then developed what was already in place He continued the Revolutionary policies of conscription and promotion based primarily on merit [424] [425]\n\n\nEducation\nNapoleon's educational reforms laid the foundation of a modern system of secondary and tertiary education in France and throughout much of Europe [432] He synthesized academic elements from the Ancien Régime, The Enlightenment, and the Revolution [433] His education laws of 1802 left most primary education in the hands of religious or communal schools which taught basic literacy and numeracy for a minority of the population [434] He abolished the revolutionary central schools and replaced them with secondary schools and elite lycées where the curriculum was based on reading, writing, mathematics, Latin, natural history, classics, and ancient history [435]\n\n\nNobility and honours\nIn May 1802, Bonaparte created the Legion of Honour whose members would be military personnel and civilians with distinguished service to the state The new institution was unpopular with republicans and the measure only passed by 14 votes to 10 in the Council of State [441] The Legion of Honour became an order of chivalry after the empire was proclaimed in 1804 In August 1806, Napoleon created an hereditary imperial nobility including princes, dukes, counts, barons and knights Eventually the empire had over 3,000 nobles and more than 30,000 members of the Legion of Honour [442] [443]\n\n\nMemory and evaluation\nThere is debate over whether Napoleon was \"an enlightened despot who laid the foundations of modern Europe\" or \"a megalomaniac who wrought greater misery than any man before the coming of Hitler\" [444] He was compared to Adolf Hitler by Pieter Geyl in 1947, [445] and Claude Ribbe in 2005 [446] Most modern critics of Napoleon, however, reject the Hitler comparison, arguing that Napoleon did not commit genocide and did not engage in the mass murder and imprisonment of his political opponents [447] [448] Nevertheless, Bell and McLynn condemn his killing of 3,000-5,000 Turkish prisoners of war in Syria [104] [105]\n\n\nCriticism\nThere is debate over whether Napoleon was \"an enlightened despot who laid the foundations of modern

controlling different forms of art to suit his propaganda goals [466]\n\n\nLong-term influence outside France\nNapoleon was responsible for spreading many of the values of the French Revolution to other countries, especially through the Napoleonic Code [475] After the fall of Napoleon, it continued to influence the law in western Europe and other parts of the world including Latin America, the Dominican Republic, Louisiana and Quebec [476]\n\n\nChildren\nNapoleon married Joséphine in 1796, but the marriage produced no children [484] In 1806, he adopted his step-son, Eugène de Beauharnais

political leader who rose to prominence during the French Revolution and its associated wars in Europe. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest military minds in history, and his campaigns and strategies are still studied by military historians and tacticians today.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nNapoleon was born on August 15, 1769, in Ajaccio, Corsica, to a family of minor nobility. His father, Carlo Buonaparte, was a lawyer and a representative of the Corsican nobility, and his mother, Letizia Ramolino, was a member of the Corsican gentry. Napoleon's family was of Italian origin, and his paternal ancestors were from a minor Tuscan noble family that emigrated to Corsica in the 16th century.\n\n**Early Career**\n\nNapoleon graduated from the École Militaire in Paris in 1785 and was commissioned a second lieutenant in La Fère artillery regiment. He served in Valence and Auxonne until after the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789. However, he spent long periods of leave in Corsica, which fed his Corsican nationalism.\n\n**Return to Corsica**\n\nUpon graduating in September 1785, Bonaparte was commissioned a second lieutenant in La Fère artillery regiment. He served in Valence and Auxonne until after the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789, but spent long periods of leave in Corsica which fed his Corsican nationalism. In September 1789, he returned to Corsica and promoted the French revolutionary cause.\n\n**Siege of Toulon**\n\nBonaparte returned to his regiment in Nice and was made captain of a coastal battery. In July 1793, he published a pamphlet, Le souper de Beaucaire (Supper at Beaucaire), demonstrating his support for the National Convention which was now heavily influenced by the Jacobins.\n\n**13 Vendémiaire**\n\nAfter the Fall of Maximilien Robespierre in July 1794, Bonaparte's association with leading Jacobins made him politically suspect to the new regime. He was arrested on 9 August but released two weeks later.\n\n**First Italian Campaign**\n\nTwo days after the marriage, Bonaparte left Paris to take command of the Army of Italy. He went on the offensive, hoping to defeat the Kingdom of Sardinia in Piedmont before their Austrian allies could intervene. In a series of victories during the Montenotte campaign, he knocked the Piedmontese out of the war in two weeks.\n\n**Egyptian Expedition**\n\nBonaparte decided that France's naval strength was not yet sufficient to confront the British Royal Navy, so he planned a military expedition to seize Egypt and thereby undermine Britain's access to its trade interests in India. He wished to establish a French presence in the Middle East and join forces with Tipu Sultan, the Sultan of Mysore, an enemy of the British.\n\n**Ruler of France**\n\nBy the time that he reached Paris in October, France's situation had been improved by a series of victories. The Republic, however, was bankrupt and the ineffective Directory was unpopular. Despite the failures in Egypt, Bonaparte returned to a hero's welcome.\n\n**French Consulate**\n\nOn 15 December, Bonaparte introduced the Constitution of the Year VIII, under which three consuls were appointed for 10 years. Real power lay with Bonaparte as First Consul, and his preferred candidates Cambacérès and Charles-François Lebrun were appointed as second and third consuls.\n\n**Temporary Peace in Europe**\n\nAfter a decade of war, France and Britain signed the Treaty of Amiens in March 1802, bringing the Revolutionary Wars to an end. Under the treaty, Britain agreed to withdraw from most of the colonies it had recently captured from France and her allies, and France agreed to evacuate Naples.\n\n**French Empire**\n\nIn February 1804, Bonaparte's police made a series of arrests in relation to a royalist plot to kidnap or assassinate him that involved the British government, Moreau and an unnamed Bourbon prince. On the advice of his foreign minister, Talleyrand, Napoleon ordered the kidnapping of the Duke of Enghien, violating the sovereignty of Baden.\n\n**War of the Third Coalition**\n\nBy September 1805, Sweden, Russia, Austria, Naples and the Ottoman Empire had joined Britain in a coalition against France. Napoleon's forces defeated the Austrian army at the Battle of Austerlitz, marking a decisive victory and cementing his position as the dominant military leader in Europe.\n\n**Middle-Eastern Alliances**\n\nNapoleon continued to entertain a grand scheme to establish a French presence in the Middle East in order to put pressure on Britain and Russia. He formed alliances with the Ottoman Empire and the Persian Empire of Fat′h-Ali Shah Qajar, but they ultimately proved unsuccessful.\n\n**War of the Fourth Coalition and Tilsit**\n\nAfter Austerlitz, Napoleon increased his political power in Europe. In 1806, he deposed the Bourbon king of Naples and installed his elder brother, Joseph, on the throne. He also established the Confederation of the Rhine, a collection of German states intended to serve as a buffer zone between France and Central Europe.\n\n**Peninsular War and Erfurt**\n\nNapoleon turned his attention to Portugal, which was reluctant to strictly enforce the blockade against its traditional ally Britain. In October 1807, 24,000 French troops under General Junot crossed the Pyrenees with Spanish consent and headed towards Portugal to enforce the blockade.\n\n**War of the Fifth Coalition**\n\nThe overthrow of the Spanish Bourbons caused alarm in Austria over Napoleon's ambitions while France's military difficulties in the Peninsular encouraged Austria to go to war. In the early morning of 10 April 1809, the Austrian army crossed the Inn River and invaded Bavaria.\n\n**Consolidation of the Empire**\n\nNapoleon's union with Joséphine had not produced a child, and he decided to secure the dynasty and strengthen its position in Europe by a strategic marriage into one of Europe's major royal houses. In November 1809, he announced his decision to divorce Joséphine and the marriage was annulled in January 1810.\n\n**Invasion of Russia**\n\nTsar Alexander saw the creation of the Grand Duchy of Warsaw, Napoleon's marriage alliance with Austria and the election of the French Marshal Bernadotte as Crown Prince of Sweden as attempts to contain Russia. In December 1810, Napoleon annexed the Duchy of Oldenburg which Alexander considered an insult.\n\n**War of the Sixth Coalition**\n\nThe French, pursued by the Russians, withdrew from most of Poland and Prussia over the winter of 1812–13 while both sides rebuilt their forces. Sweden and Prussia declared war on France in March 1813.\n\n**Exile to Elba**\n\nWith the Treaty of Fontainebleau of 11 April 1814, the allies exiled Napoleon to Elba, an island of 12,000 inhabitants in the Mediterranean, 10 km off the Tuscan coast. He was conveyed to the island on HMS Undaunted and disembarked at Portoferraio on 4 May 1814.\n\n**Hundred Days**\n\nOn 1 March 1815, Napoleon and his followers landed on the French mainland at Golfe-Juan and headed for Grenoble through the foothills of the Alps, taking the route now known as Route Napoléon. The 5th Regiment intercepted him just south of Grenoble on 7 March.\n\n**Exile on Saint Helena**\n\nNapoleon was held in British custody and transferred to the island of Saint Helena in the Atlantic Ocean, 1,870 km from the west coast of Africa. He died on 5 May 1821, at the age of 51.\n\n**Memory and Evaluation**\n\nThere is debate over whether Napoleon was \"an enlightened despot who laid the foundations of modern Europe\" or \"a megalomaniac who wrought greater misery than any man before the coming of Hitler.\" Most modern critics of Napoleon reject the Hitler comparison, arguing that Napoleon did not commit genocide and did not engage in the mass murder and imprisonment of his political opponents.\n\n**Criticism**\n\nThere is debate over whether Napoleon was \"an enlightened despot who laid the foundations of modern Europe\" or \"a megalomaniac who wrought greater misery than any man before the coming of Hitler.\" Most modern critics of Napoleon reject the Hitler comparison, arguing that Napoleon did not commit genocide and did not engage in the mass murder and imprisonment of his political opponents.\n\n**Propaganda and Memory**\n\nNapoleon's use of propaganda contributed to his rise to power, legitimated his regime, and established his image for posterity. Propaganda focused on his role as a general and a civil leader and emperor, and fostered a relationship with artists, commissioning and controlling different forms of art to suit his propaganda goals.\n\n**Long-Term Influence Outside France**\n\nNapoleon was responsible for spreading many of the values of the French Revolution to other countries, especially through the Napoleonic Code. The code continued to influence the law in western Europe and other parts of the world, including Latin America, the Dominican Republic, Louisiana and Quebec.\n\n**Children**\n\nNapoleon married Joséphine in 1796, but the marriage produced no children. In 1806, he adopted his step-son, Eugène de Beauharnais, and his second cousin, Stéphanie de Beauharnais, and arranged dynastic marriages for them.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style

to break the siege, but Bonaparte defeated every relief effort, winning the Battle of Castiglione, the Battle of Bassano, the Battle of Arcole, and the Battle of Rivoli The French triumph at Rivoli in January 1797 led to the collapse of the Austrian position in Italy At Rivoli, Austria lost 43% of its soldiers dead, wounded or taken prisoner [79] [80]\n\n\nEgyptian expedition\nAfter two months of

which were selected from indirectly elected candidates, and a Senate and Council of State which were effectively nominated by the executive [115]\n\n\nTemporary peace in Europe\nAfter a decade of war, France and Britain signed the Treaty of Amiens in March 1802, bringing the Revolutionary Wars to an end Under the treaty, Britain agreed to withdraw from most of the colonies it had recently captured

grand scheme to establish a French presence in the Middle East in order to put pressure on Britain and Russia, possibly by forming an alliance with the Ottoman Empire [93] In February 1806, Ottoman Emperor Selim III recognized Napoleon as Emperor He also opted for an alliance with France, calling France \"our sincere and natural ally\" [186] That decision brought the Ottoman Empire into a losing war against Russia and Britain A Franco-Persian alliance was formed between Napoleon and the Persian Empire of Fat′h-Ali Shah Qajar It collapsed in 1807 when France and Russia formed an unexpected alliance [93] In the end, Napoleon made no effective alliances in the Middle East [187]\n\n\nWar of the Fourth Coalition and Tilsit\nAfter Austerlitz, Napoleon increased his political power in Europe In 1806, he deposed the Bourbon king of Naples and installed his elder brother, Joseph, on the throne He then made his younger brother, Louis, King of Holland [188] He also established the

Empire [189]\n\n\nPeninsular War and Erfurt\nAfter Tilsit, Napoleon turned his attention to Portugal, which was reluctant to strictly enforce the blockade against its traditional ally Britain [203] [204] On 17 October 1807, 24,000 French troops under General Junot crossed the Pyrenees with Spanish consent and headed towards Portugal to enforce the blockade [205] Junot occupied Lisbon in November, but the Portuguese royal family had already fled to Brazil with the Portuguese fleet [206]\n\n\nWar of the Fifth Coalition\nThe overthrow of the Spanish Bourbons caused alarm in Austria over Napoleon's ambitions while France's military difficulties in the Peninsular encouraged Austria to go to war [225] [226] In the early morning of 10 April 1809, the Austrian army crossed the Inn River and invaded Bavaria The Austrian advance, however, was disorganized and they were unable to defeat the Bavarian army before the French could concentrate their forces [227] Napoleon arrived from Paris on the 17th to lead the French campaign In the following Battle of Eckmühl he was slightly wounded in the heel but the Austrians were forced to retreat across the Danube The French occupied Vienna on

was too young Napoleon then turned to Austria, and a marriage to the Austrian Emperor's daughter, Marie Louise, was quickly agreed [241]\n\n\nInvasion of Russia\nTsar Alexander saw the creation of the Grand Duchy of Warsaw, Napoleon's marriage alliance with Austria and the election of the French Marshal Bernadotte as Crown Prince of Sweden as attempts to contain Russia In December 1810, Napoleon annexed the Duchy of Oldenburg which Alexander considered an insult as his uncle was the duke The Tsar responded by allowing neutral shipping into Russian ports and banning most French imports Russia feared that Napoleon intended to restore the Kingdom of Poland while Napoleon suspected Russia of seeking an alliance with Britain against France [245] [246]\n\n\nWar of the Sixth Coalition\nThe French, pursued by the Russians, withdrew from most of Poland and Prussia over the winter of 1812–13 while both sides rebuilt their forces [263] Sweden and Prussia declared war on France in March 1813 In April, Napoleon assumed command of an army of 200,000 troops, [264] [265] and defeated the coalition at Lützen and Bautzen [266] Britain formally joined the coalition in June followed by Austria in August, [267] but the allies were again defeated in the Battle of Dresden (August 1813) [268]\n\n\nExile to Elba\nWith the Treaty of Fontainebleau of 11 April 1814, the allies exiled Napoleon to Elba, an island of 12,000 inhabitants in the Mediterranean, 10 km (6 mi) off the Tuscan coast, where they made him sovereign The following night, Napoleon attempted suicide with poison he had carried after nearly being captured by the Russians during the retreat from Moscow Its potency had weakened with age, however, and he survived to be exiled, while his wife and son took refuge in Austria [283] He was conveyed to the island on HMS Undaunted and disembarked at Portoferraio on 4 May 1814 In the first few months on Elba, he drew up plans for administrative reforms, road and building works, and improvements to the island's mines and agriculture, but results were limited by lack of funds [284] [285] [286] When Napoleon learned that Joséphine had died in France on 29 May, he was distraught and locked himself in his room for two days [287]\n\n\nHundred Days\nOn 1 March 1815, Napoleon and his followers landed on the French mainland at Golfe-Juan and headed for Grenoble through the foothills of the Alps, taking the route now known as Route Napoléon [288] [290] The 5th Regiment intercepted him just south of Grenoble on 7 March Napoleon approached the battalion alone and called to them, \"Here I am Kill your Emperor, if you wish!\" The soldiers responded with, \"Vive l'empereur!\" and joined Napoleon's men [291] [292] Six days later, 5,000 troops under Michel Ney, who had boasted that he would bring Napoleon to Paris in an iron cage, also joined Napoleon [293]\n\n\nExile on Saint Helena\nNapoleon was held in British custody and transferred to the island of Saint Helena in the Atlantic Ocean, 1,870 km (1,010 nmi) from the west coast of Africa Napoleon and 27 followers arrived at Jamestown, Saint Helena, in October 1815 on board HMS Northumberland The prisoner was guarded by a garrison of 2,100 soldiers while a squadron of 10 ships continuously patrolled the waters to prevent escape [307] In the following years, there were rumours of escape plots, but no serious attempts were made [308]\n\n\nDeath\nNapoleon's health continued to worsen, and in March 1821 he was confined to bed In April he wrote two wills declaring that he had been murdered by the British, that the Bourbons would fall and that his son would rule France He left his fortune to 97 legatees and asked to be buried by the Seine [326]\n\n\nReligion\nNapoleon was baptized in Ajaccio on 21 July 1771, and raised a Roman Catholic He began to question his faith at age 13 while at Brienne [339] Biographers have variously described him from that time as a deist, a follower of Rousseau's \"natural religion\" or a believer in destiny He consistently expressed his belief in a God or creator [340]\n\n\nReligious beliefs\nNapoleon was baptized in Ajaccio on 21 July 1771, and raised a Roman Catholic

destiny He consistently expressed his belief in a God or creator [340]\n\n\nConcordat\nSeeking national reconciliation between revolutionaries and Catholics, Napoleon and Pope Pius VII agreed to the Concordat of 1801 The agreement recognized the Catholic Church as the majority church of France and in return the Church recognized Napoleon's regime, undercutting much of the ground from royalists The Concordat confirmed the seizure of Church lands and endowments during the revolution, but reintroduced state salaries for the clergy The government also controlled the nomination of bishops for investiture by the pope Bishops and other clergy were required to swear an oath of loyalty to the regime [350] [351] [352]\n\n\nArrest of Pope Pius VII\nNapoleon progressively occupied and annexed the Papal States from 1805 When he annexed Rome in May 1809, the pope excommunicated him the following month In July, French officials arrested the pope in the Vatican and exiled him to Savona In 1812 the pontiff was transferred to the Palace of Fontainebleau in France [354] In January 1813, Napoleon pressured the pope to sign a new \"Concordat of Fontainebleau\" which was soon repudiated by the pontiff The pope was not released until 1814 [346]\n\n\nReligious emancipation\nIn February 1795, the National Convention proclaimed religious equality for France's Protestant churches and other religions In April 1802, Napoleon published laws increasing state control of Calvinist congregations and Lutheran directories, with their pastors to be paid by the state [355] With Napoleon's military victories, formal religious equality and civil rights for religious minorities spread to the conquered territories and satellite states, although their implementation varied with the local authorities [356]\n\n\nPersonality\nPieter Geyl wrote in 1947, \"It is impossible that two historians, especially two historians living in different periods, should see any historical personality in the same light.\" [358] There is no dispute that Napoleon was ambitious, although commentators disagree on whether his ambition was mostly for his own power and glory or for the welfare of France [359] [360] [361] Historians agree that Napoleon was highly intelligent with an excellent memory, [362] [363] [364] and was a superior organizer who could work efficiently for long hours [363] [365] In battle, he could rapidly dictate a series of complex commands to his subordinates, keeping in mind where major units were expected to be at each future point [366]\n\n\nAppearance and image\nIn his youth, Bonaparte was consistently described as small and thin Johann Ludwig Wurstemberger, who accompanied him in 1797 and 1798, noted that \"Bonaparte was rather slight and emaciated-looking; his face, too, was very thin, with a dark complexion.. his black, unpowdered hair hung down evenly over both shoulders\", but that, despite his slight and unkempt appearance, \"his looks and expression were earnest and powerful.\" [398]\n\n\nReforms\nNapoleon instituted numerous reforms, many of which had a lasting influence on France, Europe and the world He reformed the French administration, codified French law, implemented a new education system, and established the first French central bank, the Banque de France [406] He negotiated the Concordat of 1801 with the Catholic Church, which sought to reconcile the majority Catholic population to his regime It was presented alongside the Organic Articles, which regulated public worship in France He also implemented civil and religious equality for Protestants and Jews [407] In May 1802, he instituted the Legion of Honour to encourage civilian and military achievements The order is still the highest decoration in France [408] [409] He introduced three French constitutions culminating in the reintroduction of a hereditary monarchy and nobility [410]\n\n\nAdministration\nNapoleon introduced a series of centralizing administrative reforms soon after taking power In 1800, he established prefects appointed to run France's regional departments, sub-prefects to run districts and mayors to run towns Local representative bodies were retained, but their powers were reduced and indirect elections with a high property qualification replaced direct elections [411] Real power in the regions was now in the hands of the prefects who were judged by how they met the main priorities of Napoleon's government: efficient administration, law and order, stimulating the local economy, gathering votes for plebiscites, conscripting soldiers and provisioning the army [412] [413]\n\n\nNapoleonic Code\nNapoleon's civil code of laws, known from 1807 as the Napoleonic Code, was implemented in March 1804 It was prepared by committees of legal experts under the supervision of Jean Jacques Régis de Cambacérès, the Second Consul Napoleon participated actively in the sessions of the Council of State that revised the drafts The code introduced a clearly written and accessible set of national laws to replace the various regional and customary law systems that had operated in France [419]\n\n\nWarfare\nIn the field of military organization, Napoleon borrowed from previous theorists such as Jacques Antoine Hippolyte, Comte de Guibert, and from the reforms of preceding French governments, and then developed what was already in place He continued the Revolutionary policies of conscription and promotion based primarily on merit [424] [425]\n\n\nEducation\nNapoleon's educational reforms laid the foundation of a modern system of secondary and tertiary education in France and throughout much of Europe [432] He synthesized academic elements from the Ancien Régime, The Enlightenment, and the Revolution [433] His education laws of 1802 left most primary education in the hands of religious or communal schools which taught basic literacy and numeracy for a minority of the population [434] He abolished the revolutionary central schools and replaced them with secondary schools and elite lycées where the curriculum was based on reading, writing, mathematics, Latin, natural history, classics, and ancient history [435]\n\n\nNobility and honours\nIn May 1802, Bonaparte created the Legion of Honour whose members would be military personnel and civilians with distinguished service to the state The new institution was unpopular with republicans and the measure only passed by 14 votes to 10 in the Council of State [441] The Legion of Honour became an order of chivalry after the empire was proclaimed in 1804 In August 1806, Napoleon created an hereditary imperial nobility including princes, dukes, counts, barons and knights Eventually the empire had over 3,000 nobles and more than 30,000 members of the Legion of Honour [442] [443]\n\n\nMemory and evaluation\nThere is debate over whether Napoleon was \"an enlightened despot who laid the foundations of modern Europe\" or \"a megalomaniac who wrought greater misery than any man before the coming of Hitler\" [444] He was compared to Adolf Hitler by Pieter Geyl in 1947, [445] and Claude Ribbe in 2005 [446] Most modern critics of Napoleon, however, reject the Hitler comparison, arguing that Napoleon did not commit genocide and did not engage in the mass murder and imprisonment of his political opponents [447] [448] Nevertheless, Bell and McLynn condemn his killing of 3,000-5,000 Turkish prisoners of war in Syria [104] [105]\n\n\nCriticism\nThere is debate over whether Napoleon was \"an enlightened despot who laid the foundations of modern

rise to power, legitimated his regime, and established his image for posterity Strict censorship and control of the press, books, theatre, and art were part of his propaganda scheme, aimed at portraying him as bringing peace and stability to France Propaganda focused on his role first as a general then as a civil leader and emperor He fostered a relationship with artists, commissioning and controlling different forms of art to suit his propaganda goals [466]\n\n\nLong-term influence outside France\nNapoleon was responsible for spreading many of the values of the French Revolution to other countries, especially through the Napoleonic Code [475] After the fall of Napoleon, it continued to influence the law in western Europe and other parts of the world including Latin America, the Dominican Republic, Louisiana and Quebec [476]\n\n\nChildren\nNapoleon married Joséphine in 1796, but the marriage produced no children [484] In 1806, he adopted his step-son, Eugène de Beauharnais (1781–1824), and his second cousin, Stéphanie de Beauharnais (1789–1860), and arranged dynastic marriages for them [485]\n\n\nTitles\nOn becoming emperor, Napoleon adopted the French Imperial Eagle as

sufficient funds to pay civil servants and increase salaries [57]\nIn 2000, Tymoshenko's government provided an additional 18 billion hryvna for social payments Half of this amount was collected due

tally gave the alliance of Tymoshenko and Yushchenko a slim lead over the rival party of Prime Minister Yanukovych, thanks in part to a vigorous BYuT campaign in the industrial east, a Party of Regions stronghold [142] Although Yanukovych, whose party won the single biggest share of the vote, also claimed victory, [143] one of his coalition allies, the Socialist Party of Ukraine, failed to gain enough votes to retain seats in Parliament [144]\n\n\nSecond term as prime minister 2007–2010, and 2008 political crisis\nOn 11 July 2008, the Party of Regions tried to vote no-confidence to

Russian Gazprom, with 45 percent and 5 percent owned by Ukrainian businessmen Dmytro Firtash and Ivan Fursin, respectively) Some sources indicate that notorious criminal boss Semion Mogilevich (associated with Dmytro Firtash) also owned shares in the company [184] [185]\n\n\n2010 presidential election\nTymoshenko was a candidate in the Ukrainian presidential elections of 2010, [194] but lost that election to Viktor Yanukovych (Tymoshenko received 45.47% of the votes in the second and final round [195] of the election, 3% less than her rival) [196] [197]\n\n\nIn opposition after 2010 presidential election\nThe falsifications decided the elections, not you Like millions of Ukrainians, I assert that Yanukovych is not our president.\n\n\nThe most famous criminal cases against Tymoshenko\nOn 15 December 2010, the General Prosecutor's Office instituted a criminal case against Tymoshenko, alleging that she misused funds received by Ukraine within the framework of the Kyoto Protocol She was officially charged on 20 December 2010 [282] [283] [284] [285] Tymoshenko denied the money had been spent on pensions, insisting it was still at the disposal of the environment ministry She called the investigation against her a witch-hunt [283] According to government officials, the criminal case against Tymoshenko was a legitimate attempt to uncover corruption by the previous administration [283] In the case of \"Kyoto money\" American experts \"Covington & Burling\" and \"BDO USA\" stated the following: \"the Documents that we were able to see, clearly point out that the Kyoto Target balance account in the amount of approximately 3.3 billion on the date of receipt remained unchanged throughout the period that is considered, and that, moreover, Kyoto funds have not been touched at all in 2009 Since the balance of this account remained unchanged on the date of receipt, any accusations that Prime Minister Tymoshenko \"used\" these funds contrary to their intended purpose, are obviously false\" [286] On 7 August 2014, the Chairman of the State Treasury service Tatiana Slyuz confirmed that the Tymoshenko government has never spent \"Kyoto money\", the funds were on special accounts and in 2010 were transferred to the Yanukovych government [287] Tymoshenko was not arrested, but ordered not to leave Kyiv while the inquiry was under way [288] [289] In the same case, the environment minister in the second Tymoshenko Government, Georgiy Filipchuk, was detained [290] Filipchuk was the third minister from this government to face criminal charges since its fall in March 2010 (prosecutors charged former Interior Minister Yuriy Lutsenko with abuse of office in early December 2010, and former economy minister Bohdan Danylyshyn was detained in the Czech Republic in October 2010 on similar charges) [290] Lawmakers of BYuT blocked the rostrum and presidium of the Verkhovna Rada the next day in protest against this [291] That same day, the European People's Party issued a statement in which it \"condemns the growth of aggressive, politically motivated pressure by the Ukrainian authorities on the opposition and its leader Yulia Tymoshenko.\" [292] Tymoshenko dismissed the probe as \"terror against the opposition by President Yanukovych.\" [293] Earlier that month, Ukraine's Prosecutor General Viktor Pshonka had stated that there were no political reasons for the interrogations of the opposition leaders Tymoshenko, Lutsenko and Oleksandr Turchynov [294]\n\n\n2011 trial and imprisonment and other criminal cases against Tymoshenko\nIn May 2010, the Ukrainian General Prosecutor's office started a number of criminal cases against Tymoshenko which prevented her from normal political activity and from international travel to her allies in the West The European Parliament passed a resolution condemning the Yanukovych government for persecution of Tymoshenko as well as for prosecution in the \"Gas case\" and other cases against her and her ministers [313] On 24 June 2011, a trial started in the \"gas case\", concerning a contract signed in 2009 with Gazprom to supply natural gas to Ukraine Tymoshenko was charged with abuse of power and embezzlement, as the court found the deal anti-economic for the country and abusive [314]\n\n\nAppeal\nOn 24 October 2011, Tymoshenko filed an appeal to the decision of Pechersk district court of Kyiv regarding the \"gas case\" [364] On 1 December, the Kyiv Court of Appeal started hearing the case Tymoshenko herself was not present in the courtroom because of her health condition [365] After the hearing, the judge, Olena Sitaylo, had to call an ambulance and was hospitalized On 13 December 2011, the Kyiv Court of Appeal resumed the hearing All subsequent court sessions took place without Tymoshenko's presence Immediately prior to the hearing of the appeal, the board of judges was altered: Sitaylo, the chief justice, was appointed the day before the first hearing; other justices were appointed several days prior to the court session [366] Thus, the judges did not have time to study the 84-page case log The manner of the process proved that the decision to alter the board of judges was made beforehand At the very end, Tymoshenko's defense boycotted the court session [367]\n\n\nCassation\nOn 26 January 2012, Tymoshenko's defense submitted a cassation appeal to the High Specialized Court for Civil and Criminal Cases regarding the \"gas case\" verdict [369] On 16 August 2012, after a 7-month delay that impeded filing the case to the European Court of Human Rights, the panel of judges of the aforementioned court began hearing the case The panel finished hearing the case on 21 August and went to the jury room to make decision The ruling of the Court, issued on 29 August 2012, stated that the appeal of former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko's defense on the \"gas case\" should not be satisfied [370]\n\n\nInternational reactions\nThe \"gas case\" trial was viewed by many European and American organizations as a politically charged persecution that violates the law [374] [375] [376] [377] [378] [379] The EU and multiple international organizations see the conviction as \"justice being applied selectively under political motivation.\" [380]\n\n\nAftermath — Manafort case\nAccording to the September 2018 indictment in which Paul Manafort confessed as part of a plea bargain with U.S special prosecutor Robert Mueller, Manafort and his partner Tony Podesta, brother of Hillary Clinton's campaign manager John Podesta, helped the former Ukrainian President to conduct a media campaign in the West directed against Tymoshenko in order to undermine the support for her by the administration of then U.S President Barack Obama [392] [393] In exchange for his testimony against Manafort, Mueller gave Tony Podesta and The Podesta Group complete amnesty, including not prosecuting them for being unregistered agents of a foreign government [394] [395]\n\n\n2014 release from prison\nFollowing the Revolution of Dignity, on 21 February 2014, Parliament voted for her release in a 310–54 veto-proof vote [397] To do so, the members of parliament decriminalized the Article on which Tymoshenko was charged and brought it into compliance with Article 19 of the UN Convention against corruption That could enable immediate release of Tymoshenko through the corresponding court ruling However, Viktor Yanukovych fled the country after massive violent clashes in Kyiv that killed more than 80 people [397] [398] without signing the bill into law On 22 February 2014, the Verkhovna Rada with 322 votes adopted a decree based on the decision of the European Court of Human Rights and corresponding decision of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe [399] [400] [401] [402]\n\n\nPolitical activities after release\nImmediately after her release from prison on 22 February 2014, Yulia Tymoshenko travelled to Kyiv, where she

Tymoshenko – the non-factional people's deputy Yury V Tymoshenko [450] [451] It was done with the intention that the voters, especially older people, would make a mistake on the ballot Tymoshenko herself called it a \"dirty\" move by Poroshenko] [452]\n\n\nLocal elections 2020\nAccording to the results of the CEC, Tymoshenko's party received 4093 deputy mandates (12.39%) and became one of the

Tymoshenko, announced its opposition the ratification of the Istanbul Convention Tymoshenko believes that the Istanbul Convention is not included in the package of requirements of the EU for granting

Regions stronghold [142] Although Yanukovych, whose party won the single biggest share of the vote, also claimed victory, [143] one of his coalition allies, the Socialist Party of Ukraine, failed to gain enough votes to retain seats in Parliament [144]\n\n\nSecond term as prime minister 2007–2010, and 2008 political crisis\nOn 11 July 2008, the Party of Regions tried to vote no-confidence to Tymoshenko's government in the parliament, but could not collect enough votes [147]\n\n\nGas dispute between Russia and Ukraine (2009)\nThe conditions leading to the 2009 gas dispute [183] were created in 2006, under the Yushchenko government, when Ukraine started buying Russian gas through an intermediary, Swiss-registered RosUkrEnergo (Fifty percent of RosUkrEnergo shares were owned by the Russian Gazprom, with 45 percent and 5 percent owned by Ukrainian businessmen Dmytro Firtash and Ivan Fursin, respectively) Some sources indicate that notorious criminal boss Semion Mogilevich (associated with Dmytro Firtash) also owned shares in the company [184] [185]\n\n\n2010 presidential election\nTymoshenko was a candidate in the Ukrainian presidential elections of 2010, [194] but lost that election to Viktor Yanukovych (Tymoshenko received 45.47% of the votes in the second and final round [195] of the election, 3% less than her rival) [196] [197]\n\n\nIn opposition after 2010 presidential election\nThe falsifications decided the elections, not you Like millions of Ukrainians, I assert that Yanukovych is not our president.\n\n\nThe most famous criminal cases against Tymoshenko\nOn 15 December 2010, the General Prosecutor's Office instituted a criminal case against Tymoshenko, alleging that she misused funds received by Ukraine within the framework of the Kyoto Protocol She was officially charged on 20 December 2010 [282] [283] [284] [285] Tymoshenko denied the money had been spent on pensions, insisting it was still at the disposal of the environment ministry She called the investigation against her a witch-hunt [283] According to government officials, the criminal case against Tymoshenko was a legitimate attempt to uncover corruption by the previous administration [283] In the case of \"Kyoto money\" American experts \"Covington & Burling\" and \"BDO USA\" stated the following: \"the Documents that we were able to see, clearly point out that the Kyoto Target balance account in the amount of approximately 3.3 billion on the date of receipt remained unchanged throughout the period that is considered, and that, moreover, Kyoto funds have not been touched at all in 2009 Since the balance of this account remained unchanged on the date of receipt, any accusations that Prime Minister Tymoshenko \"used\" these funds contrary to their intended purpose, are obviously false\" [286] On 7 August 2014, the Chairman of the State Treasury service Tatiana Slyuz confirmed that the Tymoshenko government has never spent \"Kyoto money\", the funds were on special accounts and in 2010 were transferred to the Yanukovych government [287] Tymoshenko was not arrested, but ordered not to leave Kyiv while the inquiry was under way [288] [289] In the same case, the environment minister in the second Tymoshenko Government, Georgiy Filipchuk, was detained [290] Filipchuk was the third minister from this government to face criminal charges since its fall in March 2010 (prosecutors charged former Interior Minister Yuriy Lutsenko with abuse of office in early December 2010, and former economy minister Bohdan Danylyshyn was detained in the Czech Republic in October 2010 on similar charges) [290] Lawmakers of BYuT blocked the rostrum and presidium of the Verkhovna Rada the next day in protest against this [291] That same day, the European People's Party issued a statement in which it \"condemns the growth of aggressive, politically motivated pressure by the Ukrainian authorities on the opposition and its leader Yulia Tymoshenko.\" [292] Tymoshenko dismissed the probe as \"terror against the opposition by President Yanukovych.\" [293] Earlier that month, Ukraine's Prosecutor General Viktor Pshonka had stated that there were no political reasons for the interrogations of the opposition leaders Tymoshenko, Lutsenko and Oleksandr Turchynov [294]\n\n\n2011 trial and imprisonment and other criminal cases against Tymoshenko\nIn May 2010, the Ukrainian General Prosecutor's office started a number of criminal cases against Tymoshenko which prevented her from normal political activity and from international travel to her allies in the West The European Parliament passed a resolution condemning the Yanukovych government for persecution of Tymoshenko as well as for prosecution in the \"Gas case\" and other cases against her and her ministers [313] On 24 June 2011, a trial started in the \"gas case\", concerning a contract signed in 2009 with Gazprom to supply natural gas to Ukraine Tymoshenko was charged with abuse of power and embezzlement, as the court found the deal anti-economic for the country and abusive [314]\n\n\nAppeal\nOn 24 October 2011, Tymoshenko filed an appeal to the decision of Pechersk district court of Kyiv regarding the \"gas case\" [364] On 1 December, the Kyiv Court of Appeal started hearing the case Tymoshenko herself was not present in the courtroom because of her health condition [365] After the hearing, the judge, Olena Sitaylo, had to call an ambulance and was hospitalized On 13 December 2011, the Kyiv Court of Appeal resumed the hearing All subsequent court sessions took place without Tymoshenko's presence Immediately prior to the hearing of the appeal, the board of judges was altered: Sitaylo, the chief justice, was appointed the day before the first hearing; other justices were appointed several days prior to the court session [366] Thus, the judges did not have time to study the 84-page case log The manner of the process proved that the decision to alter the board of judges was made beforehand At the very end, Tymoshenko's defense boycotted the court session [367]\n\n\nCassation\nOn 26 January 2012, Tymoshenko's defense submitted a cassation appeal to the High Specialized Court for Civil and Criminal Cases regarding the \"gas case\" verdict [369] On 16 August 2012, after a 7-month delay that impeded filing the case to the European Court of Human Rights, the panel of judges of the aforementioned court began hearing the case The panel finished hearing the case on 21 August and went to the jury room to make decision The ruling of the Court, issued on 29 August 2012, stated that the appeal of former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko's defense on the \"gas case\" should not be satisfied [370]\n\n\nInternational reactions\nThe \"gas case\" trial was viewed by many European and American organizations as a politically charged persecution that violates the law [374] [375] [376] [377] [378] [379] The EU and multiple international organizations see the conviction as \"justice being applied selectively under political motivation.\" [380]\n\n\nAftermath — Manafort case\nAccording to the September 2018 indictment in which Paul Manafort confessed as part of a plea bargain with U.S special prosecutor Robert Mueller, Manafort and his partner Tony Podesta, brother of Hillary Clinton's campaign manager John Podesta, helped the former Ukrainian President to conduct a media campaign in the West directed against Tymoshenko in order to undermine the support for her by the administration of then U.S President Barack Obama [392] [393] In exchange for his testimony against Manafort, Mueller gave Tony Podesta and The Podesta Group complete amnesty, including not prosecuting them for being unregistered agents of a foreign government [394] [395]\n\n\n2014 release from prison\nFollowing the Revolution of Dignity, on 21 February 2014, Parliament voted for her release in a 310–54 veto-proof vote [397] To do so, the members of parliament decriminalized the Article on which Tymoshenko was charged and brought it into compliance with Article 19 of the UN Convention against corruption That could enable immediate release of Tymoshenko through the corresponding court ruling However, Viktor Yanukovych fled the country after massive violent clashes in Kyiv that killed more than 80 people [397] [398] without signing the bill into law On 22 February 2014, the Verkhovna Rada with 322 votes adopted a decree based on the decision of the European Court of Human Rights and corresponding decision of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe [399] [400] [401] [402]\n\n\nPolitical activities after release\nImmediately after her release from prison on 22 February 2014, Yulia Tymoshenko travelled to Kyiv, where she attended a makeshift memorial to the first slain protesters on Hrushevskogo Street and gave a speech on Maidan stage [414] In the following days, she had a number of meetings and phone conversations with USA, EU, and OSCE officials Tymoshenko addressed the European Union, leaders of western democracies and of countries which guaranteed Ukraine's territorial unity according to the Budapest

Constitution of Ukraine [445] [446]\n\n\n2019 presidential election\nOn 20 June 2018, Tymoshenko announced that she would take part in the 2019 Ukrainian presidential election [447] She was a heavy favorite in the polls until early 2019 [citation needed] Two weeks before the election, candidate Serhiy Taruta pledged his campaign-team would support Tymoshenko's campaign efforts (however, his name was not taken off the ballot, the deadline to withdraw having been exceeded) [448] [449]\nOn 8 February 2019, a new presidential candidate was registered with the same surname and initials as Yulia Tymoshenko – the non-factional people's deputy Yury V Tymoshenko [450] [451] It was done with the intention that the voters, especially older people, would make a mistake on the ballot Tymoshenko herself called it a \"dirty\" move by Poroshenko] [452]\n\n\nLocal elections 2020\nAccording to the results of the CEC, Tymoshenko's party received 4093 deputy mandates (12.39%) and became one of the leading parties in local elections in Ukraine [458]\n\n\nParliamentary and political activities (2019–2021)\nIn the 2019 parliamentary election, she led the Batkivshchyna list which came in third, with 8.18% of the vote and 26 seats in parliament [459] Tymoshenko became a member of the Parliamentary Committee on Social Policy and Protection of Veterans' Rights [460] Tymoshenko's activities in this session of the Rada focussed on opposition to lifting the moratorium on land sales and pushing for government action to lower energy prices.\n\n\nParliamentary and political activities (2022–present)\nOn 27 January 2022, the Verkhovna Rada adopted a resolution initiated by Tymoshenko to establish a Temporary Commission of Inquiry to investigate possible corruption that caused significant losses to the revenue side of the state budget, in particular as a result of NJSC Naftogaz Tymoshenko became a member of this VSC [479] On 20 June, the Batkivshchyna faction, led by Yulia Tymoshenko, announced its opposition the ratification of the Istanbul Convention Tymoshenko believes that the Istanbul Convention is not included in the package of requirements of the EU for granting Ukraine a candidate She noted that the Verkhovna Rada went against the will of Ukrainians, because such an important issue should be determined at a national referendum [480] [481] On 19 July, deputies of the Batkivshchyna faction prevented the theft of 264 billion hryvnias from the budget, which Naftogaz of Ukraine was supposed to spend on an opaque scheme for financing the purchase of natural gas for the next heating season [482] [483] [484] On 29 July during a working visit to Japan, Tymoshenko discussed the situation in Ukraine with Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike [485] On the same day, Tymoshenko spoke at a conference in Tokyo and called for the creation of a new stable security order in the world [486]\n\n\n2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine\nIn late February 2022, Yulia

[490]\n\n\nPolitical views\nTymoshenko wants her country to become a member state of the EU, while also expressing concern about antagonizing Russia, [501] [502] saying: \"I try to defend our interests so that we can find a balance in our relations both with the EU and Russia.\" [501] Tymoshenko supports Ukraine joining NATO, stating it would be \"uncomfortable\" for Ukraine to remain \"in a void, outside all existing security systems\" [501] According to Tymoshenko, the question of Ukraine joining any system of collective security would \"be resolved only by referendum\" [503]

European project has not been completed as yet It has not been completed because there is no full-fledged participation of Ukraine.\" [506] She opposes foreign intervention in internal Ukrainian affairs: \"Ukraine's realization of its sovereign rights, forming a modern political nation, cannot be considered as a policy aimed against anyone.\" [507] Tymoshenko does not want to expand the lease contract of the Russian Black Sea fleet in Ukraine, saying: \"The Constitution of Ukraine quite clearly stipulates that foreign military bases cannot be deployed in Ukraine, and this constitutional
