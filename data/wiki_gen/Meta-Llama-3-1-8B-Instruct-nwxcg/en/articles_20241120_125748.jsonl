With two people of their personalities and in their position, romance was bound to flourish Both were orphans in need of affection, and they found that they could give it to each other During the summer of 1909, they decided that they were in love.\" [34]\n\n\nFirst World War\nIn August 1914, Britain entered the First World War Tolkien's relatives were shocked when he elected not to volunteer immediately for the British Army In a 1941 letter to his son Michael, Tolkien recalled: \"In those days chaps joined up, or were scorned publicly It was a nasty cleft to be in for a young man with too much imagination and little physical courage.\" [T 4] Instead, Tolkien, \"endured the obloquy\", [T 4] and entered a programme by which he delayed enlistment until completing his degree By the time he passed his finals in July 1915, Tolkien recalled that the hints were \"becoming outspoken from relatives\" [T 4] He was commissioned as a temporary second lieutenant in the Lancashire Fusiliers on 15 July 1915 [41] [42] He trained with the 13th (Reserve) Battalion on Cannock Chase, Rugeley Camp near to Rugeley, Staffordshire, for 11 months In a letter to Edith, Tolkien complained: \"Gentlemen are rare among the superiors, and even human beings rare indeed.\" [43] Following their wedding, Lieutenant and Mrs Tolkien took up lodgings near the training camp [41] On 2 June 1916, Tolkien received a telegram summoning him to Folkestone for posting to France The Tolkiens spent the night before his departure in a room at the Plough & Harrow Hotel in Edgbaston, Birmingham [44] He later wrote: \"Junior officers were being killed off, a dozen a minute Parting from my wife then .. it was like a death.\" [45]\n\n\nFrance\nOn 5 June 1916, Tolkien boarded a troop transport for an overnight voyage to Calais Like other soldiers arriving for the first time, he was sent to the British Expeditionary Force's base depot at Étaples On 7 June, he was informed that he had been assigned as a signals officer to the 11th (Service) Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers The battalion was part of the 74th Brigade, 25th Division While waiting to be summoned to his unit, Tolkien sank into boredom To pass the time, he composed a poem titled The Lonely Isle, which was inspired by his feelings during the sea crossing to Calais To evade the British Army's postal censorship, he developed a code of dots by which Edith could track his movements [46] He left Étaples on 27 June 1916 and joined his battalion at Rubempré, near Amiens [47] He found himself commanding enlisted men who were drawn mainly from the mining, milling, and weaving towns of Lancashire [48] According to John Garth, he \"felt an affinity for these working class men\", but military protocol prohibited friendships with \"other ranks\" Instead, he was required to \"take charge of them, discipline them, train them, and probably censor their letters .. If possible, he was supposed to inspire their love and loyalty.\" [49] Tolkien later lamented, \"The most improper job of any man .. is bossing other men Not one in a million is fit for it, and least of all those who seek the opportunity.\" [49]\n\n\nBattle of the Somme\nTolkien arrived at the Somme in early July 1916 In between terms behind the lines at Bouzincourt, he participated in the assaults on the Schwaben Redoubt and the Leipzig salient Tolkien's time in combat was a terrible stress for Edith, who feared that every knock on the door might carry news of her husband's death Edith could track her husband's movements on a map of the Western Front The Reverend Mervyn S Evers, Anglican chaplain to the Lancashire Fusiliers, recorded that Tolkien and his fellow officers were eaten by \"hordes of lice\" which found the Medical Officer's ointment merely \"a kind of hors d'oeuvre and the little beggars went at their feast with renewed vigour.\" [50] On 27 October 1916, as his battalion attacked Regina Trench, Tolkien contracted trench fever, a disease carried by lice He was invalided to England on 8 November 1916 [51]\n\n\nHome front\nA weak and emaciated Tolkien spent the remainder of the war alternating between hospitals and garrison duties, being deemed medically unfit for general service [55] [56] [57] During his recovery in a cottage in Little Haywood, Staffordshire, he began to work on what he called The Book of Lost Tales, beginning with The Fall of Gondolin Lost Tales represented Tolkien's attempt to create a mythology for England, a project he would abandon without ever completing [58] Throughout 1917 and 1918 his illness kept recurring, but he had recovered enough to do home service at various camps It was at this time that Edith bore their first child, John Francis Reuel Tolkien In a 1941 letter, Tolkien described his son John as \"(conceived and carried during the starvation-year of 1917 and the great U-boat campaign) round about the Battle of Cambrai, when the end of the war seemed as far off as it does now\" [T 4] Tolkien was promoted to the temporary rank of lieutenant on 6 January 1918 [59] When he was stationed at Kingston upon Hull, he and Edith went walking in the woods at nearby Roos, and Edith began to dance for him in a clearing among the flowering hemlock After his wife's death in 1971, Tolkien remembered: [T 5]\n\n\nAcademic and writing career\nAfter the end of World War I in 1918, Tolkien's first civilian job was at the Oxford English Dictionary, where he worked mainly on the history and etymology of words of Germanic origin beginning with the letter W [63] In mid-1919, he began to tutor Oxford undergraduates privately, most importantly those of Lady Margaret Hall and St Hugh's College, given that the women's colleges were in great need of good teachers in their early years, and Tolkien as a married academic (then still not common) was considered suitable, as a bachelor don would not have been [64]\n\n\nBeowulf\nIn the 1920s, Tolkien undertook a translation of Beowulf, which he finished in 1926, but did not publish It was later edited by his son Christopher and published in 2014 [69]\n\n\nSecond World War\nIn the run-up to the Second World War, Tolkien was earmarked as a codebreaker In January 1939, he was asked to serve in the cryptographic department of the Foreign Office in the event of national emergency Beginning on 27 March, he took an instructional course at the London HQ of the Government Code and Cypher School He was informed in October that his services would not be required [76] [T 6] [77]\n\n\nFamily\nThe Tolkiens had four children: John Francis Reuel Tolkien (17 November 1917 – 22 January 2003), Michael Hilary Reuel Tolkien (22 October 1920 – 27 February 1984), Christopher John Reuel Tolkien (21 November 1924 – 16 January 2020) and Priscilla Mary Anne Reuel Tolkien (18 June 1929 – 28 February 2022) [82] [83] Tolkien was very devoted to his children and sent them illustrated letters from Father Christmas when they were young [84]\n\n\nRetirement\nDuring his life in retirement, from 1959 up to his death in 1973, Tolkien received steadily increasing public attention and literary fame In 1961, his friend C S Lewis even nominated him for the Nobel Prize in Literature [85] The sales of his books were so profitable that he regretted that he had not chosen early retirement [16] In a 1972 letter, he deplored having become a cult figure, but admitted that \"even the nose of a very modest idol .. cannot remain entirely untickled by the sweet smell of incense!\" [T 7]\n\n\nFinal years\nEdith died on 29 November 1971, at the age of 82 Ronald returned to Oxford, where Merton College gave him convenient rooms near the High Street He missed Edith, but enjoyed being back in the city [87]\n\n\nViews\nTolkien's Catholicism was a significant factor in C S Lewis's conversion from atheism to Christianity [94] He once wrote to Rayner Unwin's daughter Camilla, who wished to know the purpose of life, that it was \"to increase according to our capacity our knowledge of God by all the means we have, and to be moved by it to praise and thanks.\" [95] He had a special devotion to the blessed sacrament, writing to his son Michael that in \"the Blessed Sacrament .. you will find romance, glory, honour, fidelity, and the true way of all your loves upon earth, and more than that\" [T 4] He accordingly encouraged frequent reception of Holy Communion, again writing to his son Michael that \"the only cure for sagging of fainting faith is Communion.\" He believed the Catholic Church to be true most of all because of the pride of place and the honour in which it holds the Blessed Sacrament [T 11] In the last years of his life, Tolkien resisted certain liturgical changes implemented after the Second Vatican Council, his primary objection being the use of English for the liturgy [96] Tolkien spoke Latin fluently, and he felt that the English translations were clumsy [97] In his old age he continued to make the Mass responses in Latin [87] [98] Tolkien did not sign the Agatha Christie indult, however, and he served as a lector at Corpus Christi, a parish church in Headington, in accordance with the allowances of the Council [99]\n\n\nReligion\nTolkien's Catholicism was a significant factor in C S Lewis's conversion from

Agatha Christie indult, however, and he served as a lector at Corpus Christi, a parish church in Headington, in accordance with the allowances of the Council [99]\n\n\nRace\nTolkien's fantasy writings have been said to embody a racist attitude [100] [101] Scholars have noted that he was influenced by Victorian attitudes to race and to a literary tradition of monsters, and that he was anti-racist in peacetime and during the World Wars With the late 19th-century background of eugenics and a fear of moral decline, some critics saw the mention of race mixing in The Lord of the Rings as embodying scientific racism [102] Other commentators saw in Tolkien's orcs a reflection of wartime propaganda caricatures of the Japanese [103] Critics have observed that the work embodies a moral geography, with good in the West, evil in the East [104] Against this, scholars have noted that Tolkien was outraged in peacetime by Nazi racial theory, while during the Second World War he was equally disgusted by anti-German racial propaganda [105] [106] Other scholars have stated that Tolkien's Middle-earth is definitely polycultural and polylingual, and that attacks on Tolkien based on The Lord of the Rings often omit evidence from the text [107] [108]\n\n\nNature\nDuring most of his own life, conservationism was not yet on the political agenda, and Tolkien himself did not directly express conservationist views—except in some private letters, in which he tells about his fondness for forests and sadness at tree-felling In later years, a number of authors of biographies or literary analyses of Tolkien conclude that during his writing of The Lord of the Rings, Tolkien gained increased interest in the value of wild and untamed nature, and in protecting what wild nature was left in the industrialized world [109] [110] [111]\n\n\nWriting\nTolkien's fantasy books on Middle-earth, especially The Lord of the Rings and The Silmarillion, drew on a wide array of influences, including his philological interest in language, [112] Christianity, [113] [114] medievalism, [115] mythology, archaeology, [116] ancient and modern literature, and personal experience His philological work centred on the study of Old English literature, especially Beowulf, and he acknowledged its importance to his writings [117] He was a gifted linguist, influenced by Germanic, [118] Celtic, [119] Finnish, [120] and Greek [121] [122] language and mythology Commentators have attempted to identify many literary and topological antecedents for characters, places and events in Tolkien's writings Some writers were important to him, including the Arts and Crafts polymath William Morris, [123] and he undoubtedly made use of some real place-names, such as Bag End, the name of his aunt's home [124] He acknowledged, too, John Buchan and H Rider Haggard, authors of modern adventure stories that he enjoyed [125] [126] [127] The effects of some specific experiences have been identified Tolkien's childhood in the English countryside, and its urbanization by the growth of Birmingham, influenced his creation of the Shire, [128] while his personal experience of fighting in the trenches of the First World War affected his depiction of Mordor [129]\n\n\nInfluences\nTolkien's fantasy books on Middle-earth, especially The Lord of the Rings and The Silmarillion, drew on a wide array of

lecture, later published as an article, revolutionized the treatment of the Anglo-Saxon epic Beowulf by literary critics The essay remains highly influential in the study of Old English literature to this day [130] Beowulf is one of the most significant influences upon Tolkien's later fiction, with major details of both The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings being adapted from the poem [131]\n\n\n\"Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics\"\nIn addition to writing fiction, Tolkien was an author of academic literary criticism His seminal 1936 lecture, later published as an article, revolutionized the treatment of the Anglo-Saxon epic Beowulf by literary critics The essay remains highly influential in the study of Old English literature to this day [130] Beowulf is one of the most significant influences upon Tolkien's later fiction, with major details of both The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings being adapted from the poem [131]\n\n\n\"On Fairy-Stories\"\nThis essay discusses the fairy-story as a literary form It was initially written as the 1939 Andrew Lang Lecture at the University of St Andrews, Scotland Tolkien focuses on Andrew Lang's work as a folklorist and collector of fairy tales He disagreed with Lang's broad inclusion, in his Fairy Book collections, of traveller's tales, beast fables, and other types of stories Tolkien held a narrower perspective, viewing fairy stories as those that took place in Faerie, an enchanted realm, with or without fairies as characters He viewed them as the natural development of the interaction of human imagination and human language [132]\n\n\nChildren's books and other short works\nIn addition to his mythopoeic compositions, Tolkien enjoyed inventing fantasy stories to entertain his children [133] He wrote annual Christmas letters from Father Christmas for them, building up a series of short stories (later compiled and published as The Father Christmas Letters) [134] Other works included Mr Bliss and Roverandom (for children), and Leaf by Niggle (part of Tree and Leaf), The Adventures of Tom Bombadil, Smith of Wootton Major and Farmer Giles of Ham Roverandom and Smith of Wootton Major, like The Hobbit, borrowed ideas from his legendarium [135]\n\n\nThe Hobbit\nTolkien never expected his stories to become popular, but by sheer accident a book called The Hobbit, which he had written some years before for his own children, came in 1936 to the attention of Susan Dagnall, an employee of the London publishing firm George Allen & Unwin, who persuaded Tolkien to submit it for publication [91] When it was published a year later, the book attracted adult readers as well as children, and it became popular enough for the publishers to ask Tolkien to produce a sequel [136]\n\n\nThe Lord of the Rings\nThe request for a sequel prompted Tolkien to begin what became his most famous work: the epic novel The Lord of the Rings (originally published in three volumes in 1954–1955) Tolkien spent more than ten years writing the primary narrative and appendices for The Lord of the Rings, during which time he received the constant support of the Inklings, in particular his closest friend C. S. Lewis, the author of The Chronicles of Narnia Both The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings are set against the background of The Silmarillion, but in a time long after it [137]\n\n\nThe Silmarillion\nTolkien wrote a brief \"Sketch of the Mythology\", which included the tales of Beren and Lúthien and of Túrin; and that sketch eventually evolved into the Quenta Silmarillion, an epic history that Tolkien started three times but never published Tolkien desperately hoped to publish it along with The Lord of the Rings, but publishers (both Allen & Unwin and Collins) declined Moreover, printing costs were very high in 1950s Britain, requiring The Lord of the Rings to be published in three volumes [145] The story of this continuous redrafting is told in the posthumous series The History of Middle-earth, edited by Tolkien's son, Christopher Tolkien From around 1936, Tolkien began to extend this framework to include the tale of The Fall of Númenor, which was inspired by the legend of Atlantis [146]\n\n\nUnfinished Tales and The History of Middle-earth\nIn 1980, Christopher Tolkien published a collection of more fragmentary material, under the title Unfinished Tales of Númenor and Middle-earth In subsequent years (1983–1996), he published a large amount of the remaining unpublished materials, together with notes and extensive commentary, in a series of twelve volumes called The History of Middle-earth They contain unfinished, abandoned, alternative, and outright contradictory accounts, since they were always a work in progress for Tolkien and he only rarely settled on a definitive version for any of the stories There is not complete consistency between The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, the two most closely related works, because Tolkien never fully integrated all their traditions into each other He commented in 1965, while editing The Hobbit for a third edition, that he would have preferred to rewrite the book completely because of the style of its prose [148]\n\n\nWorks compiled by Christopher Tolkien\nBefore his death, Tolkien negotiated the sale of the manuscripts, drafts, proofs and other materials related to his then-published works—including The Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit and Farmer Giles of Ham—to the Department of Special Collections and University Archives at Marquette University's John P Raynor, S.J., Library in Milwaukee, Wisconsin [158] After his death his estate donated the papers containing Tolkien's Silmarillion mythology and his academic work to the Bodleian Library at Oxford University [159] The Bodleian Library held an exhibition of his work in 2018, including more than 60 items which had never been seen in public before [160]\n\n\nManuscript locations\nBefore his death,

which had never been seen in public before [160]\n\n\nLanguages and philology\nBoth Tolkien's academic career and his literary production are inseparable from his love of language and philology He specialized in English philology at university and in 1915 graduated with Old Norse as his special subject He worked on the Oxford English Dictionary from 1918 and is credited with having worked on a number of words starting with the letter W, including walrus, over which he struggled mightily [162] [163] In 1920, he became Reader in English Language at the University of Leeds, where he claimed credit for raising the number of students of linguistics from five to twenty He gave courses in Old English heroic verse, history of English, various Old English and Middle English texts, Old and Middle English philology, introductory Germanic philology, Gothic, Old Icelandic, and Medieval Welsh When in 1925, aged thirty-three, Tolkien applied for the Rawlinson and Bosworth Professorship of Anglo-Saxon at Pembroke College, Oxford, he boasted that his students of Germanic philology in Leeds had even formed a \"Viking Club\" [T 12] He had a certain, if imperfect, knowledge of Finnish [164]\n\n\nLinguistic career\nBoth Tolkien's academic career and his literary production are inseparable from his love of language and philology He specialized in English philology at university and

boasted that his students of Germanic philology in Leeds had even formed a \"Viking Club\" [T 12] He had a certain, if imperfect, knowledge of Finnish [164]\n\n\nLanguage construction\nParallel to Tolkien's professional work as a philologist, and sometimes overshadowing this work, to the effect that his academic output remained rather thin, was his affection for constructing languages The most developed of these are Quenya and Sindarin, the etymological connection between which formed the core of much of Tolkien's legendarium Language and grammar for Tolkien was a matter of aesthetics and euphony, and Quenya in particular was designed from \"phonaesthetic\" considerations; it was intended as an \"Elven-latin\", and was phonologically based on Latin, with ingredients from Finnish, Welsh, English, and Greek [T 14]\n\n\nArtwork\nTolkien learnt to paint and draw as a child and continued to do so all his adult life From early in his writing career, the development of his stories was accompanied by drawings and paintings, especially of landscapes, and by maps of the lands in which the tales were set He produced pictures to accompany the stories told to his own children, including those later published in Mr Bliss and Roverandom, and sent them elaborately illustrated letters purporting to come from Father Christmas Although he regarded himself as an amateur, the publisher used the author's own cover art, his maps, and full-page illustrations for the early editions of The Hobbit He prepared maps and illustrations for The Lord of the Rings, but the first edition contained only the maps, his calligraphy for the inscription on the One Ring, and his ink drawing of the Doors of Durin Much of his artwork was collected and published in 1995 as a book: J R R Tolkien: Artist and Illustrator The book discusses Tolkien's paintings, drawings, and sketches, and reproduces approximately 200 examples of his work [168] Catherine McIlwaine curated a major exhibition of Tolkien's artwork at the Bodleian Library, Tolkien: Maker of Middle-earth, accompanied by a book of the same name that analyses Tolkien's achievement and illustrates the full range of the types of artwork that he created [169]\n\n\nLegacy\nWhile many other authors had published works of fantasy before Tolkien, the great success of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings led directly to a popular resurgence and the shaping of the modern fantasy genre This has caused Tolkien to be popularly identified as the \"father\" of modern fantasy literature [170] [171]—or, more precisely, of high fantasy, [172] as in the work of authors such as Ursula Le Guin and her Earthsea series [173] In 2008, The Times ranked him sixth on a list of \"The 50 greatest British writers since 1945\" [174] His influence has extended to music, including the Danish group the Tolkien Ensemble's setting of all the poetry in The Lord of the Rings to their vocal music; [175] and to a broad range of games set in Middle-earth [176]\nAmong literary allusions to Tolkien, he appears as the elderly \"Professor J B Timbermill\" in all five novels in J I M Stewart's series A Staircase in Surrey [177] [178] The scholar Tom Shippey describes Tolkien as the \"author of the  [20th] century\", [179] and states that \"I do not think any modern writer of epic fantasy has managed to escape the mark of Tolkien, no matter how hard many of them have tried\" [180] John Clute, writing in The Encyclopedia of Fantasy, similarly credits Tolkien with being \"the twentieth-century's single most important author of fantasy\" [181] His work has had a massive impact on western pop culture, and remains extremely influential [182]\n\n\nInfluence\nWhile many other authors had published works of fantasy before

[182]\n\n\nAdaptations\nIn a 1951 letter to publisher Milton Waldman (1895–1976), Tolkien wrote about his intentions to create a \"body of more or less connected legend\", of which \" [t]he cycles should be linked to a majestic whole, and yet leave scope for other minds and hands, wielding paint and music and drama\" [T 16] The hands and minds of many artists have indeed been inspired by Tolkien's legends Personally known to him were Pauline Baynes (Tolkien's favourite illustrator of The Adventures of Tom Bombadil and Farmer Giles of Ham) and Donald Swann (who set the music to The Road Goes Ever On) Queen Margrethe II of Denmark created illustrations to The Lord of the Rings in the early 1970s She sent them to Tolkien, who was struck by the similarity they bore in style to his own drawings [183] Tolkien was not implacably opposed to the idea of a dramatic adaptation, however, and sold the film, stage and merchandise rights of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings to United Artists in 1968 United Artists never made a film, although director John Boorman was planning a live-action film in the early 1970s In 1976, the rights were sold to Tolkien Enterprises, a division of the Saul Zaentz Company, and the first film adaptation of The Lord of the Rings was released in 1978 as an animated rotoscoping film directed by Ralph Bakshi with screenplay by the fantasy writer Peter S Beagle It covered only the first half of the story of The Lord of the Rings [184]\n\n\nPossible sainthood\nOn 2 September 2017, the Oxford Oratory, Tolkien's parish church during his time in Oxford, offered its first Mass for the intention of Tolkien's cause for beatification to be opened [192] [193] A prayer was written for his cause [192]\n\n\nMemorials\nTolkien and the characters and places from his works have become eponyms of many real-world objects These include geographical features on Titan (Saturn's largest moon), [194]\nstreet names such as There and Back Again Lane, inspired by The Hobbit, [195]\nmountains such as Mount Shadowfax, Mount Gandalf and Mount Aragorn in Canada, [196] [197]\ncompanies such as Palantir Technologies, [198]\nand species including the wasp Shireplitis tolkieni, [199] 37 new species of Elachista moths, [199] [200] and many fossils [201] [202] [203]\n\n\nNotes\nA small selection of books about Tolkien and his works:\n\n\nReferences\nA

"article": "**Introduction**\n\nJohn Ronald Reuel Tolkien (1892-1973) was an English author, philologist, and university professor best known for his fantasy stories, particularly \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Lord of the Rings.\" He is widely regarded as one of the most influential authors of the 20th century, and his works have been translated into more than 50 languages and have sold millions of copies worldwide.\n\n**Biography**\n\nTolkien was born in Bloemfontein, South Africa, to Arthur Reuel Tolkien, a bank manager, and Mabel Suffield, a writer. When Tolkien was three years old, his family moved to England, where he spent most of his childhood. His father died when he was four years old, and his mother struggled to make ends meet. Tolkien's early education was at King Edward's School in Birmingham, where he developed a passion for languages, particularly Latin and Greek.\n\n**Ancestry**\n\nTolkien's paternal ancestors were middle-class craftsmen who made and sold clocks, watches, and pianos in London and Birmingham. The Tolkien family originated in the East Prussian town of Kreuzburg near Königsberg, where his earliest-known paternal ancestor, Michel Tolkien, was born around 1620.\n\n**Childhood**\n\nTolkien had his first encounter with a constructed language, Animalic, when he was a teenager. He later invented his own language, Naffarin, which was a precursor to the Elvish languages he would later develop. Tolkien learned Esperanto and composed a poem titled \"The Book of the Foxrook,\" which was inspired by his feelings during a sea crossing.\n\n**Youth**\n\nTolkien met Edith Mary Bratt, who was three years his senior, when he moved into the boarding house where she lived. They became romantically involved and eventually married. Tolkien's relatives were shocked when he elected not to volunteer for the British Army during World War I. Instead, he delayed enlistment until completing his degree.\n\n**War**\n\nTolkien joined the British Army in 1915 and was commissioned as a temporary second lieutenant in the Lancashire Fusiliers. He trained with the 13th (Reserve) Battalion on Cannock Chase and was later sent to France. Tolkien contracted trench fever and was invalided to England, where he spent the remainder of the war alternating between hospitals and garrison duties.\n\n**Academic and Writing Career**\n\nAfter the war, Tolkien became a lecturer in English Language at the University of Leeds, where he claimed credit for raising the number of students of linguistics from five to twenty. He later became Reader in English Language at Pembroke College, Oxford. Tolkien's academic career was accompanied by his love of language and philology, which led to the development of his own constructed languages, including Quenya and Sindarin.\n\n**The Hobbit**\n\nTolkien never expected his stories to become popular, but by sheer accident, a book called \"The Hobbit,\" which he had written for his own children, came to the attention of Susan Dagnall, an employee of the publishing firm George Allen & Unwin. The book attracted adult readers as well as children and became popular enough for the publishers to ask Tolkien to produce a sequel.\n\n**The Lord of the Rings**\n\nTolkien spent more than ten years writing the primary narrative and appendices for \"The Lord of the Rings,\" during which time he received the constant support of the Inklings, a literary group that included his closest friend, C.S. Lewis. The book was published in three volumes between 1954 and 1955.\n\n**The Silmarillion**\n\nTolkien wrote a brief \"Sketch of the Mythology,\" which included the tales of Beren and Lúthien and of Túrin, and this eventually evolved into the Quenta Silmarillion, an epic history that Tolkien started three times but never published.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nTolkien's work has had a massive impact on western pop culture, and he is widely regarded as the \"father\" of modern fantasy literature.

With two people of their personalities and in their position, romance was bound to flourish Both were orphans in need of affection, and they found that they could give it to each other During the summer of 1909, they decided that they were in love.\" [34]\n\n\nFirst World War\nIn August 1914, Britain entered the First World War Tolkien's relatives were shocked when he elected not to volunteer immediately for the British Army In a 1941 letter to his son Michael, Tolkien recalled: \"In those days chaps joined up, or were scorned publicly It was a nasty cleft to be in for a young man with too much imagination and little physical courage.\" [T 4] Instead, Tolkien, \"endured the obloquy\", [T 4] and entered a programme by which he delayed enlistment until completing his degree By the time he passed his finals in July 1915, Tolkien recalled that the hints were \"becoming outspoken from relatives\" [T 4] He was commissioned as a temporary second lieutenant in the Lancashire Fusiliers on 15 July 1915 [41] [42] He trained with the 13th (Reserve) Battalion on Cannock Chase, Rugeley Camp near to Rugeley, Staffordshire, for 11 months In a letter to Edith, Tolkien complained: \"Gentlemen are rare among the superiors, and even human beings rare indeed.\" [43] Following their wedding, Lieutenant and Mrs Tolkien took up lodgings near the training camp [41] On 2 June 1916, Tolkien received a telegram summoning him to Folkestone for posting to France The Tolkiens spent the night before his departure in a room at the Plough & Harrow Hotel in Edgbaston, Birmingham [44] He later wrote: \"Junior officers were being killed off, a dozen a minute Parting from my wife then .. it was like a death.\" [45]\n\n\nFrance\nOn 5 June 1916, Tolkien boarded a troop transport for an overnight voyage to Calais Like other soldiers arriving for the first time, he was sent to the British Expeditionary Force's base depot at Étaples On 7 June, he was informed that he had been assigned as a signals officer to the 11th (Service) Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers The battalion was part of the 74th Brigade, 25th Division While waiting to be summoned to his unit, Tolkien sank into boredom To pass the time, he composed a poem titled The Lonely Isle, which was inspired by his feelings during the sea crossing to Calais To evade the British Army's postal censorship, he developed a code of dots by which Edith could track his movements [46] He left Étaples on 27 June 1916 and joined his battalion at Rubempré, near Amiens [47] He found himself commanding enlisted men who were drawn mainly from the mining, milling, and weaving towns of Lancashire [48] According to John Garth, he \"felt an affinity for these working class men\", but military protocol prohibited friendships with \"other ranks\" Instead, he was required to \"take charge of them, discipline them, train them, and probably censor their letters .. If possible, he was supposed to inspire their love and loyalty.\" [49] Tolkien later lamented, \"The most improper job of any man .. is bossing other men Not one in a million is fit for it, and least of all those who seek the opportunity.\" [49]\n\n\nBattle of the Somme\nTolkien arrived at the Somme in early July 1916 In between terms behind the lines at Bouzincourt, he participated in the assaults on the Schwaben Redoubt and the Leipzig salient Tolkien's time in combat was a terrible stress for Edith, who feared that every knock on the door might carry news of her husband's death Edith could track her husband's movements on a map of the Western Front The Reverend Mervyn S Evers, Anglican chaplain to the Lancashire Fusiliers, recorded that Tolkien and his fellow officers were eaten by \"hordes of lice\" which found the Medical Officer's ointment merely \"a kind of hors d'oeuvre and the little beggars went at their feast with renewed vigour.\" [50] On 27 October 1916, as his battalion attacked Regina Trench, Tolkien contracted trench fever, a disease carried by lice He was invalided to England on 8 November 1916 [51]\n\n\nHome front\nA weak and emaciated Tolkien spent the remainder of the war alternating between hospitals and garrison duties, being deemed medically unfit for general service [55] [56] [57] During his recovery in a cottage in Little Haywood, Staffordshire, he began to work on what he called The Book of Lost Tales, beginning with The Fall of Gondolin Lost Tales represented Tolkien's attempt to create a mythology for England, a project he would abandon without ever completing [58] Throughout 1917 and 1918 his illness kept recurring, but he had recovered enough to do home service at various camps It was at this time that Edith bore their first child, John Francis Reuel Tolkien In a 1941 letter, Tolkien described his son John as \"(conceived and carried during the starvation-year of 1917 and the great U-boat campaign) round about the Battle of Cambrai, when the end of the war seemed as far off as it does now\" [T 4] Tolkien was promoted to the temporary rank of lieutenant on 6 January 1918 [59] When he was stationed at Kingston upon Hull, he and Edith went walking in the woods at nearby Roos, and Edith began to dance for him in a clearing among the flowering hemlock After his wife's death in 1971, Tolkien remembered: [T 5]\n\n\nAcademic and writing career\nAfter the end of World War I in 1918, Tolkien's first civilian job was at the Oxford English Dictionary, where he worked mainly on the history and etymology of words of Germanic origin beginning with the letter W [63] In mid-1919, he began to tutor Oxford undergraduates privately, most importantly those of Lady Margaret Hall and St Hugh's College, given that the women's colleges were in great need of good teachers in their early years, and Tolkien as a married academic (then still not common) was considered suitable, as a bachelor don would not have been [64]\n\n\nBeowulf\nIn the 1920s, Tolkien undertook a translation of Beowulf, which he finished in 1926, but did not publish It was later edited by his son Christopher and published in 2014 [69]\n\n\nSecond World War\nIn the run-up to the Second World War, Tolkien was earmarked as a codebreaker In January 1939, he was asked to serve in the cryptographic department of the Foreign Office in the event of national emergency Beginning on 27 March, he took an instructional course at the London HQ of the Government Code and Cypher School He was informed in October that his services would not be required [76] [T 6] [77]\n\n\nFamily\nThe Tolkiens had four children: John Francis Reuel Tolkien (17 November 1917 – 22 January 2003), Michael Hilary Reuel Tolkien (22 October 1920 – 27 February 1984), Christopher John Reuel Tolkien (21 November 1924 – 16 January 2020) and Priscilla Mary Anne Reuel Tolkien (18 June 1929 – 28 February 2022) [82] [83] Tolkien was very devoted to his children and sent them illustrated letters from Father Christmas when they were young [84]\n\n\nRetirement\nDuring his life in retirement, from 1959 up to his death in 1973, Tolkien received steadily increasing public attention and literary fame In 1961, his friend C S Lewis even nominated him for the Nobel Prize in Literature [85] The sales of his books were so profitable that he regretted that he had not chosen early retirement [16] In a 1972 letter, he deplored having become a cult figure, but admitted that \"even the nose of a very modest idol .. cannot remain entirely untickled by the sweet smell of incense!\" [T 7]\n\n\nFinal years\nEdith died on 29 November 1971, at the age of 82 Ronald returned to Oxford, where Merton College gave him convenient rooms near the High Street He missed Edith, but enjoyed being back in the city [87]\n\n\nViews\nTolkien's Catholicism was a significant factor in C S Lewis's conversion from atheism to Christianity [94] He once wrote to Rayner Unwin's daughter Camilla, who wished to know the purpose of life, that it was \"to increase according to our capacity our knowledge of God by all the means we have, and to be moved by it to praise and thanks.\" [95] He had a special devotion to the blessed sacrament, writing to his son Michael that in \"the Blessed Sacrament .. you will find romance, glory, honour, fidelity, and the true way of all your loves upon earth, and more than that\" [T 4] He accordingly encouraged frequent reception of Holy Communion, again writing to his son Michael that \"the only cure for sagging of fainting faith is Communion.\" He believed the Catholic Church to be true most of all because of the pride of place and the honour in which it holds the Blessed Sacrament [T 11] In the last years of his life, Tolkien resisted certain liturgical changes implemented after the Second Vatican Council, his primary objection being the use of English for the liturgy [96] Tolkien spoke Latin fluently, and he felt that the English translations were clumsy [97] In his old age he continued to make the Mass responses in Latin [87] [98] Tolkien did not sign the Agatha Christie indult, however, and he served as a lector at Corpus Christi, a parish church in Headington, in accordance with the allowances of the Council [99]\n\n\nReligion\nTolkien's Catholicism was a significant factor in C S Lewis's conversion from

have been said to embody a racist attitude [100] [101] Scholars have noted that he was influenced by Victorian attitudes to race and to a literary tradition of monsters, and that he was anti-racist in peacetime and during the World Wars With the late 19th-century background of eugenics and a fear of moral decline, some critics saw the mention of race mixing in The Lord of the Rings as embodying scientific racism [102] Other commentators saw in Tolkien's orcs a reflection of wartime propaganda caricatures of the Japanese [103] Critics have observed that the work embodies a moral geography, with good in the West, evil in the East [104] Against this, scholars have noted that Tolkien was outraged in peacetime by Nazi racial theory, while during the Second World War he was equally disgusted by anti-German racial propaganda [105] [106] Other scholars have stated that Tolkien's Middle-earth is definitely polycultural and polylingual, and that attacks on Tolkien based on The Lord of the Rings often omit evidence from the text [107] [108]\n\n\nNature\nDuring most of his own life, conservationism was not yet on the political agenda, and Tolkien himself did not directly express conservationist views—except in some private letters, in which he tells about his fondness for forests and sadness at tree-felling In later years, a number of authors of biographies or literary analyses of Tolkien conclude that during his writing of The Lord of the Rings, Tolkien gained increased interest in the value of wild and untamed nature, and in protecting what wild nature was left in the industrialized world [109] [110] [111]\n\n\nWriting\nTolkien's fantasy books on Middle-earth, especially The Lord of the Rings and The Silmarillion, drew on a wide array of influences, including his philological interest in language, [112] Christianity, [113] [114] medievalism, [115] mythology, archaeology, [116] ancient and modern literature, and personal experience His philological work centred on the study of Old English literature, especially Beowulf, and he acknowledged its importance to his writings [117] He was a gifted linguist, influenced by Germanic, [118] Celtic, [119] Finnish, [120] and Greek [121] [122] language and mythology Commentators have attempted to identify many literary and topological antecedents for characters, places and events in Tolkien's writings Some writers were important to him, including the Arts and Crafts polymath William Morris, [123] and he undoubtedly made use of some real place-names, such as Bag End, the name of his aunt's home [124] He acknowledged, too, John Buchan and H Rider Haggard, authors of modern adventure stories that he enjoyed [125] [126] [127] The effects of some specific experiences have been identified Tolkien's childhood in the English countryside, and its urbanization by the growth of Birmingham, influenced his creation of the Shire, [128] while his personal experience of fighting in the trenches of the First World War affected his depiction of Mordor [129]\n\n\nInfluences\nTolkien's fantasy books on Middle-earth, especially The Lord of the Rings and The Silmarillion, drew on a wide array of

lecture, later published as an article, revolutionized the treatment of the Anglo-Saxon epic Beowulf by literary critics The essay remains highly influential in the study of Old English literature to this day [130] Beowulf is one of the most significant influences upon Tolkien's later fiction, with major details of both The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings being adapted from the poem [131]\n\n\n\"Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics\"\nIn addition to writing fiction, Tolkien was an author of academic literary criticism His seminal 1936 lecture, later published as an article, revolutionized the treatment of the Anglo-Saxon epic Beowulf by literary critics The essay remains highly influential in the study of Old English literature to this day [130] Beowulf is one of the most significant influences upon Tolkien's later fiction, with major details of both The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings being adapted from the poem [131]\n\n\n\"On Fairy-Stories\"\nThis essay discusses the fairy-story as a literary form It was initially written as the 1939 Andrew Lang Lecture at the University of St Andrews, Scotland Tolkien focuses on Andrew Lang's work as a folklorist and collector of fairy tales He disagreed with Lang's broad inclusion, in his Fairy Book collections, of traveller's tales, beast fables, and other types of stories Tolkien held a narrower perspective, viewing fairy stories as those that took place in Faerie, an enchanted realm, with or without fairies as characters He viewed them as the natural development of the interaction of human imagination and human language [132]\n\n\nChildren's books and other short works\nIn addition to his mythopoeic compositions, Tolkien enjoyed inventing fantasy stories to entertain his children [133] He wrote annual Christmas letters from Father Christmas for them, building up a series of short stories (later compiled and published as The Father Christmas Letters) [134] Other works included Mr Bliss and Roverandom (for children), and Leaf by Niggle (part of Tree and Leaf), The Adventures of Tom Bombadil, Smith of Wootton Major and Farmer Giles of Ham Roverandom and Smith of Wootton Major, like The Hobbit, borrowed ideas from his legendarium [135]\n\n\nThe Hobbit\nTolkien never expected his stories to become popular, but by sheer accident a book called The Hobbit, which he had written some years before for his own children, came in 1936 to the attention of Susan Dagnall, an employee of the London publishing firm George Allen & Unwin, who persuaded Tolkien to submit it for publication [91] When it was published a year later, the book attracted adult readers as well as children, and it became popular enough for the publishers to ask Tolkien to produce a sequel [136]\n\n\nThe Lord of the Rings\nThe request for a sequel prompted Tolkien to begin what became his most famous work: the epic novel The Lord of the Rings (originally published in three volumes in 1954–1955) Tolkien spent more than ten years writing the primary narrative and appendices for The Lord of the Rings, during which time he received the constant support of the Inklings, in particular his closest friend C. S. Lewis, the author of The Chronicles of Narnia Both The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings are set against the background of The Silmarillion, but in a time long after it [137]\n\n\nThe Silmarillion\nTolkien wrote a brief \"Sketch of the Mythology\", which included the tales of Beren and Lúthien and of Túrin; and that sketch eventually evolved into the Quenta Silmarillion, an epic history that Tolkien started three times but never published Tolkien desperately hoped to publish it along with The Lord of the Rings, but publishers (both Allen & Unwin and Collins) declined Moreover, printing costs were very high in 1950s Britain, requiring The Lord of the Rings to be published in three volumes [145] The story of this continuous redrafting is told in the posthumous series The History of Middle-earth, edited by Tolkien's son, Christopher Tolkien From around 1936, Tolkien began to extend this framework to include the tale of The Fall of Númenor, which was inspired by the legend of Atlantis [146]\n\n\nUnfinished Tales and The History of Middle-earth\nIn 1980, Christopher Tolkien published a collection of more fragmentary material, under the title Unfinished Tales of Númenor and Middle-earth In subsequent years (1983–1996), he published a large amount of the remaining unpublished materials, together with notes and extensive commentary, in a series of twelve volumes called The History of Middle-earth They contain unfinished, abandoned, alternative, and outright contradictory accounts, since they were always a work in progress for Tolkien and he only rarely settled on a definitive version for any of the stories There is not complete consistency between The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, the two most closely related works, because Tolkien never fully integrated all their traditions into each other He commented in 1965, while editing The Hobbit for a third edition, that he would have preferred to rewrite the book completely because of the style of its prose [148]\n\n\nWorks compiled by Christopher Tolkien\nBefore his death, Tolkien negotiated the sale of the manuscripts, drafts, proofs and other materials related to his then-published works—including The Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit and Farmer Giles of Ham—to the Department of Special Collections and University Archives at Marquette University's John P Raynor, S.J., Library in Milwaukee, Wisconsin [158] After his death his estate donated the papers containing Tolkien's Silmarillion mythology and his academic work to the Bodleian Library at Oxford University [159] The Bodleian Library held an exhibition of his work in 2018, including more than 60 items which had never been seen in public before [160]\n\n\nManuscript locations\nBefore his death,

which had never been seen in public before [160]\n\n\nLanguages and philology\nBoth Tolkien's academic career and his literary production are inseparable from his love of language and philology He specialized in English philology at university and in 1915 graduated with Old Norse as his special subject He worked on the Oxford English Dictionary from 1918 and is credited with having worked on a number of words starting with the letter W, including walrus, over which he struggled mightily [162] [163] In 1920, he became Reader in English Language at the University of Leeds, where he claimed credit for raising the number of students of linguistics from five to twenty He gave courses in Old English heroic verse, history of English, various Old English and Middle English texts, Old and Middle English philology, introductory Germanic philology, Gothic, Old Icelandic, and Medieval Welsh When in 1925, aged thirty-three, Tolkien applied for the Rawlinson and Bosworth Professorship of Anglo-Saxon at Pembroke College, Oxford, he boasted that his students of Germanic philology in Leeds had even formed a \"Viking Club\" [T 12] He had a certain, if imperfect, knowledge of Finnish [164]\n\n\nLinguistic career\nBoth Tolkien's academic career and his literary production are inseparable from his love of language and philology He specialized in English philology at university and

boasted that his students of Germanic philology in Leeds had even formed a \"Viking Club\" [T 12] He had a certain, if imperfect, knowledge of Finnish [164]\n\n\nLanguage construction\nParallel to Tolkien's professional work as a philologist, and sometimes overshadowing this work, to the effect that his academic output remained rather thin, was his affection for constructing languages The most developed of these are Quenya and Sindarin, the etymological connection between which formed the core of much of Tolkien's legendarium Language and grammar for Tolkien was a matter of aesthetics and euphony, and Quenya in particular was designed from \"phonaesthetic\" considerations; it was intended as an \"Elven-latin\", and was phonologically based on Latin, with ingredients from Finnish, Welsh, English, and Greek [T 14]\n\n\nArtwork\nTolkien learnt to paint and draw as a child and continued to do so all his adult life From early in his writing career, the development of his stories was accompanied by drawings and paintings, especially of landscapes, and by maps of the lands in which the tales were set He produced pictures to accompany the stories told to his own children, including those later published in Mr Bliss and Roverandom, and sent them elaborately illustrated letters purporting to come from Father Christmas Although he regarded himself as an amateur, the publisher used the author's own cover art, his maps, and full-page illustrations for the early editions of The Hobbit He prepared maps and illustrations for The Lord of the Rings, but the first edition contained only the maps, his calligraphy for the inscription on the One Ring, and his ink drawing of the Doors of Durin Much of his artwork was collected and published in 1995 as a book: J R R Tolkien: Artist and Illustrator The book discusses Tolkien's paintings, drawings, and sketches, and reproduces approximately 200 examples of his work [168] Catherine McIlwaine curated a major exhibition of Tolkien's artwork at the Bodleian Library, Tolkien: Maker of Middle-earth, accompanied by a book of the same name that analyses Tolkien's achievement and illustrates the full range of the types of artwork that he created [169]\n\n\nLegacy\nWhile many other authors had published works of fantasy before Tolkien, the great success of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings led directly to a popular resurgence and the shaping of the modern fantasy genre This has caused Tolkien to be popularly identified as the \"father\" of modern fantasy literature [170] [171]—or, more precisely, of high fantasy, [172] as in the work of authors such as Ursula Le Guin and her Earthsea series [173] In 2008, The Times ranked him sixth on a list of \"The 50 greatest British writers since 1945\" [174] His influence has extended to music, including the Danish group the Tolkien Ensemble's setting of all the poetry in The Lord of the Rings to their vocal music; [175] and to a broad range of games set in Middle-earth [176]\nAmong literary allusions to Tolkien, he appears as the elderly \"Professor J B Timbermill\" in all five novels in J I M Stewart's series A Staircase in Surrey [177] [178] The scholar Tom Shippey describes Tolkien as the \"author of the  [20th] century\", [179] and states that \"I do not think any modern writer of epic fantasy has managed to escape the mark of Tolkien, no matter how hard many of them have tried\" [180] John Clute, writing in The Encyclopedia of Fantasy, similarly credits Tolkien with being \"the twentieth-century's single most important author of fantasy\" [181] His work has had a massive impact on western pop culture, and remains extremely influential [182]\n\n\nInfluence\nWhile many other authors had published works of fantasy before

[182]\n\n\nAdaptations\nIn a 1951 letter to publisher Milton Waldman (1895–1976), Tolkien wrote about his intentions to create a \"body of more or less connected legend\", of which \" [t]he cycles should be linked to a majestic whole, and yet leave scope for other minds and hands, wielding paint and music and drama\" [T 16] The hands and minds of many artists have indeed been inspired by Tolkien's legends Personally known to him were Pauline Baynes (Tolkien's favourite illustrator of The Adventures of Tom Bombadil and Farmer Giles of Ham) and Donald Swann (who set the music to The Road Goes Ever On) Queen Margrethe II of Denmark created illustrations to The Lord of the Rings in the early 1970s She sent them to Tolkien, who was struck by the similarity they bore in style to his own drawings [183] Tolkien was not implacably opposed to the idea of a dramatic adaptation, however, and sold the film, stage and merchandise rights of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings to United Artists in 1968 United Artists never made a film, although director John Boorman was planning a live-action film in the early 1970s In 1976, the rights were sold to Tolkien Enterprises, a division of the Saul Zaentz Company, and the first film adaptation of The Lord of the Rings was released in 1978 as an animated rotoscoping film directed by Ralph Bakshi with screenplay by the fantasy writer Peter S Beagle It covered only the first half of the story of The Lord of the Rings [184]\n\n\nPossible sainthood\nOn 2 September 2017, the Oxford Oratory, Tolkien's parish church during his time in Oxford, offered its first Mass for the intention of Tolkien's cause for beatification to be opened [192] [193] A prayer was written for his cause [192]\n\n\nMemorials\nTolkien and the characters and places from his works have become eponyms of many real-world objects These include geographical features on Titan (Saturn's largest moon), [194]\nstreet names such as There and Back Again Lane, inspired by The Hobbit, [195]\nmountains such as Mount Shadowfax, Mount Gandalf and Mount Aragorn in Canada, [196] [197]\ncompanies such as Palantir Technologies, [198]\nand species including the wasp Shireplitis tolkieni, [199] 37 new species of Elachista moths, [199] [200] and many fossils [201] [202] [203]\n\n\nNotes\nA small selection of books about Tolkien and his works:\n\n\nReferences\nA

sister, Anne Robin, who was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico in 1947, and a younger brother, Andrew Lee Morrison, who was born in Los Altos, California in 1948 [20]\n\n\n1961–1963: Literary influences\nMorrison's senior year English teacher later said, \"Jim read as much and probably more than any student in class, but everything he read was so offbeat I had another teacher (who was going to the Library of Congress) check to see if the books Jim was reporting on actually existed [32] I suspected he was making them up, as they were English books on sixteenth- and seventeenth-century demonology I'd never heard of them, but they existed, and I'm convinced from the paper he wrote that he read them, and the Library of Congress would've been the only source.\" [25]\n\n\n1964–1965: College experience in Los Angeles\nMorrison soon transferred to the film program at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), [37] where he enrolled in Jack Hirschman's class on Antonin Artaud in UCLA's Comparative Literature program Artaud's surrealist theater brand profoundly impacted Morrison's dark poetic sensibility of cinematic theatricality [38]\n\n\n1965–1971: The Doors\nIn the middle of 1965, after graduating with a bachelor's degree from the UCLA film school, Morrison led a bohemian lifestyle in Venice Beach Living on the rooftop of a building inhabited by his UCLA classmate, Dennis Jakob, he wrote the lyrics of many of the early songs the Doors would later perform live and record on albums, such as \"Moonlight Drive\" and \"Hello, I Love You\" According to fellow UCLA student Ray Manzarek, he lived on canned beans and LSD for several months [43]\n\n\nDeath\nI got a phone call and I didn't believe it because we used to hear shit like that all the time—that Jim jumped off a cliff or something So we sent our manager off to Paris, and he called and said it was true.\n\n\nPersonal life\nMorrison's early life was the semi-nomadic existence typical of military families [118] Jerry Hopkins recorded Morrison's brother, Andy, explaining that his parents had determined never to use corporal punishment such as spanking on their children They instead instilled discipline by the military tradition known as \"dressing down\", which consisted of yelling at and berating the children until they were reduced to tears and acknowledged their failings [119] Once Morrison graduated from UCLA, he broke off most contact with his family By the time his music ascended to the top of the charts (in 1967) he had not been in communication with his family for more than a year and falsely claimed that everyone in his immediate family was dead (or claimed that he was an only child) [91] [120] However, Morrison told Hopkins in a 1969 interview for Rolling Stone magazine that he did this because he did not want to involve his family in his musical career [121] His sister similarly believed that \"he did it to protect my dad, who was moving up in the Navy, and to keep his life separate, not to shake it up on both sides.\" [122]\n\n\nMorrison's family\nMorrison's early life was the semi-nomadic existence typical of military families [118] Jerry

separate, not to shake it up on both sides.\" [122]\n\n\nRelationships\nMorrison was sought after by many as a photographer's model, confidant, romantic partner and sexual conquest He had several serious relationships and many casual encounters By many accounts, he could also be inconsistent with his partners, displaying what some recall as \"a dual personality\" [130] Rothchild recalls, \"Jim really was two very distinct and different people A Jekyll and Hyde When he was sober, he was Jekyll, the most erudite, balanced, friendly kind of guy ..

He was a key figure in the 1960s counterculture movement and is widely regarded as one of the most iconic and influential rock stars of all time.\n\n**Biography**\n\nMorrison was born on December 8, 1943, in Melbourne, Florida, to Clara Virginia (née Clarke; 1919–2005) and Lt.(j.g.) George Stephen Morrison (1919–2008), a future rear admiral in the United States Navy. His ancestors were Scottish, Irish, and English. In August 1964, Admiral Morrison was commanding U.S naval forces during the Gulf of Tonkin incident. The following year, in 1965, the incident was a leading pretext used to justify U.S engagement in the Vietnam War.\n\nMorrison had a younger sister, Anne Robin, who was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico in 1947, and a younger brother, Andrew Lee Morrison, who was born in Los Altos, California in 1948.\n\n**Early years and education**\n\nMorrison's early life was marked by frequent moves due to his father's military career. He attended various schools, including a Catholic school in Whittier, California, and a public school in Los Angeles. Morrison's education was often disrupted, but he was drawn to the study of literature, poetry, and philosophy. He was particularly influenced by German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, whose ideas of a world with no objective order or structure would later shape his own worldview.\n\n# 1961–1963: Literary influences\n\nMorrison's senior year English teacher later said, \"Jim read as much and probably more than any student in class, but everything he read was so offbeat I had another teacher (who was going to the Library of Congress) check to see if the books Jim was reporting on actually existed.\" Morrison's love of literature and philosophy would later influence his music and poetry.\n\n# 1964–1965: College experience in Los Angeles\n\nMorrison soon transferred to the film program at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he enrolled in Jack Hirschman's class on Antonin Artaud in UCLA's Comparative Literature program. Artaud's surrealist theater brand profoundly impacted Morrison's dark poetic sensibility of cinematic theatricality.\n\n**1965–1971: The Doors**\n\nIn the middle of 1965, after graduating with a bachelor's degree from the UCLA film school, Morrison led a bohemian lifestyle in Venice Beach. He wrote the lyrics of many of the early songs the Doors would later perform live and record on albums, such as \"Moonlight Drive\" and \"Hello, I Love You.\" According to fellow UCLA student Ray Manzarek, he lived on canned beans and LSD for several months.\n\nMorrison's poetry and songwriting were influenced by his interests in literature, philosophy, and psychology. He was particularly drawn to the works of Arthur Rimbaud, William Blake, and Friedrich Nietzsche. His poetry and songwriting often explored themes of love, death, and the human condition.\n\n**Death**\n\nMorrison's death on July 3, 1971, at the age of 27, was a shock to his fans and the music world. He was found dead in his bathtub in Paris, France, with the cause of death listed as heart failure. The circumstances surrounding his death remain unclear, and many rumors and conspiracy theories have emerged over the years.\n\n**Personal life**\n\nMorrison's early life was the semi-nomadic existence typical of military families. He was often exposed to the harsh realities of military life, including the Gulf of Tonkin incident, which would later influence his music and poetry. Morrison's father, George Morrison, was a rear admiral in the United States Navy, and his family's military background would often be referenced in his music.\n\nMorrison's relationships with women were often tumultuous and passionate. He had several serious relationships, including with Pamela Courson, who was his partner at the time of his death. Morrison's relationships with women often influenced his music and poetry, with many of his songs exploring themes of love and desire.\n\n**Artistic influences**\n\nMorrison's artistic influences were diverse and far-reaching. He was particularly drawn to the works of German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, whose ideas of a world with no objective order or structure would later shape his own worldview. Morrison was also influenced by the surrealist movement, which emphasized the importance of the subconscious and the irrational.\n\n# Poetry and film\n\nMorrison began writing in earnest during his adolescence. At UCLA, he studied the related fields of theater, film, and cinematography. He self-published two volumes of poetry in 1969, titled The Lords / Notes on Vision and The New Creatures. These poems were later combined into a single volume titled The Lords and The New Creatures.\n\nMorrison's poetry was influenced by his interests in literature, philosophy, and psychology. He was particularly drawn to the works of Arthur Rimbaud, William Blake, and Friedrich Nietzsche. His poetry often explored themes of love, death, and the human condition.\n\n# Paris Journal\n\nAfter his death, a notebook of poetry written by Morrison was recovered, titled Paris Journal. Among other personal details, it contains the allegorical foretelling of a man who will be left grieving and having to abandon his belongings, due to a police investigation into a death connected to the Chinese opium trade.\n\n**Grave site**\n\nMorrison was buried in Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris, one of the city's most visited tourist attractions, where Irish playwright Oscar Wilde, French cabaret singer Édith Piaf, and many other poets and artists are also buried. The grave had no official marker until French officials placed a shield over it, which was stolen in 1973.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nMorrison was and continues to be one of the most popular and influential singer-songwriters and iconic frontmen in rock history. To this day, he is widely regarded as the prototypical rock star: surly, sexy, scandalous, and mysterious. The leather pants he was fond of wearing both onstage and off have since become stereotyped as rock-star apparel.\n\n**Musical**\n\nMorrison was and continues to be one of the most popular and influential singer-songwriters and iconic frontmen in rock history. To this day, he is widely regarded as the prototypical rock star: surly, sexy, scandalous, and mysterious. The leather pants he was fond of wearing both onstage and off have since become stereotyped as rock-star apparel.\n\n**Influences**\n\nIggy and the Stooges are said to have formed after lead singer Iggy Pop was inspired by Morrison while attending a Doors concert in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Pop later said about the concert, \"It was like a revelation. I was blown away.\"\n\n**Films**\n\nIn 1991, Oliver Stone directed a biopic film about Morrison, with actor Val Kilmer portraying him. Kilmer learned over twenty of the Doors' songs to achieve Morrison's role. While the film was inspired by many real events and individuals, the film's depiction of Morrison was heavily criticized by many people who knew him personally, including Patricia Kennealy and the other Doors members.\n\nIn 2007, the film Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story has numerous references to Morrison. Morrison's grave is featured in The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon Season 1, episode 3.\n\n**Discography**\n\nThe Doors\n\n* The Doors (1967)\n* Strange Days (1967)\n* Waiting for the Sun (1968)\n* The Soft Parade (1969)\n* Morrison Hotel (1970)\n* L.A.

going to the Library of Congress) check to see if the books Jim was reporting on actually existed [32] I suspected he was making them up, as they were English books on sixteenth- and

typical of military families [118] Jerry Hopkins recorded Morrison's brother, Andy, explaining that his parents had determined never to use corporal punishment such as spanking on their children They instead instilled discipline by the military tradition known as \"dressing down\", which consisted of yelling at and berating the children until they were reduced to tears and acknowledged their failings [119] Once Morrison graduated from UCLA, he broke off most contact with his family By the time his music ascended to the top of the charts (in 1967) he had not been in communication with his family for more than a year and falsely claimed that everyone in his immediate family was dead (or claimed that he was an only child) [91] [120] However, Morrison told Hopkins in a 1969 interview for Rolling Stone magazine that he did this because he did not want to involve his family in his musical career [121] His sister similarly believed that \"he did it to protect my dad, who was moving up in the Navy, and to keep his life separate, not to shake it up on both sides.\" [122]\n\n\nMorrison's family\nMorrison's early life was the semi-nomadic existence typical of military families [118] Jerry

serious relationships and many casual encounters By many accounts, he could also be inconsistent with his partners, displaying what some recall as \"a dual personality\" [130] Rothchild recalls, \"Jim really was two very distinct and different people A Jekyll and Hyde When he was sober, he was Jekyll, the most erudite, balanced, friendly kind of guy ..

their intentions Several requests by the surveyors to enter Nepal were denied [21]\n\n\n20th century\nIn 1856, Andrew Waugh announced Everest (then known as Peak XV) as 8,840 m (29,002 ft) high, after several years of calculations based on observations made by the Great Trigonometrical Survey [33] \nFrom 1952 to 1954, the Survey of India, using triangulation methods, determined that the height of Everest was 8,847.73 m (29,028 ft) [34] In 1975 it was subsequently reaffirmed by a Chinese measurement of 8,848.13 m (29,029.30 ft) [35] In both cases the snow cap, not the rock head, was measured.\nThe 8,848 m (29,029 ft) height given was officially recognised by Nepal and China [36] Nepal planned a new survey in 2019 to determine if the April 2015 Nepal earthquake affected the height of the mountain [37]\n\n\n21st century\nOn 9 October 2005, after several months of measurement and calculation, the Chinese Academy of Sciences and State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping announced the height of Everest as 8,844.43 m (29,017.16 ft) with accuracy of ±0.21 m (8.3 in), claiming it was the most accurate and precise measurement to date [42] This height is based on the highest point of rock and not the snow and ice covering it The Chinese team measured a snow-ice depth of 3.5 m (11 ft), [35] which is in agreement with a net elevation of 8,848 m (29,029 ft) An argument arose between China and Nepal as to whether the official height should be the rock height (8,844 m, China) or the snow height (8,848 m, Nepal) In 2010, both sides agreed that the height of Everest is 8,848 m, and Nepal recognises China's claim that the rock height of Everest is 8,844 m [43] On 8 December 2020, it was jointly announced by the two countries that the new official height is 8,848.86 metres (29,031.7 ft) [44] [45]\n\n\nComparisons\nThe summit of Everest is the point at which Earth's surface reaches the greatest distance above sea level Several other mountains are sometimes claimed to be the \"tallest mountains on Earth\" Mauna Kea in Hawaii is tallest when measured from its base; [note 5] it rises over 10,200 m (33,464.6 ft) from its base on the mid-ocean floor, but only attains 4,205 m (13,796 ft) above sea level.\n\n\nContext and maps\nNearby peaks include Lhotse, 8,516 m (27,940 ft); Nuptse, 7,855 m (25,771 ft), and Changtse, 7,580 m (24,870 ft) among others Another nearby peak is Khumbutse, and many of the highest mountains in the world are near Mount Everest On the southwest side, a major feature in the lower areas is the Khumbu icefall and glacier, an obstacle to climbers on those routes but also to the base camps.\n\n\nGeology\nGeologists have subdivided the rocks comprising Mount Everest into three units called formations [52] [53] Each formation is separated from the other by low-angle faults, called detachments, along which they have been thrust southward over each other From the summit of Mount Everest to its base these rock units are the Qomolangma Formation, the North Col Formation, and the Rongbuk Formation.\n\n\nIUGS geological heritage site\nIn respect of the recognition of the \"highest rocks on the planet\" as fossiliferous, marine limestone, the Ordovician Rocks of Mount Everest were included by the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) in its assemblage of 100 geological heritage sites around the world in a listing published in October 2022 The organisation defines an IUGS Geological Heritage Site as \"a key place with geological elements and/or processes of international scientific relevance, used as a reference, and/or with a substantial contribution to the development of geological sciences through history.\" [67]\n\n\nFlora and fauna\nThere is very little native flora or fauna on Everest A type of moss grows at 6,480 metres (21,260 ft) on Mount Everest and it may be the highest altitude plant species [68] An alpine cushion plant called Arenaria is known to grow below 5,500 metres (18,000 ft) in the region [69] According to the study based on satellite data from 1993 to 2018, vegetation is expanding in the Everest region Researchers have found plants in areas that were previously deemed bare [70]\n\n\nClimate\nMount Everest has an ice cap climate (Köppen EF) with all months averaging well below freezing [note 6]\n\n\nClimate change\nThe base camp for Everest expeditions based out of Nepal is located by Khumbu Glacier, which is rapidly thinning and destabilizing due to climate change, making it unsafe for climbers As recommended by the committee formed by Nepal's government to facilitate and monitor mountaineering in the Everest region, Taranath Adhikari—the director general of Nepal's tourism department—said they have plans to move the base camp to a lower altitude This would mean a longer distance for climbers between the base camp and Camp 1 However, the present base camp is still useful and could still serve its purpose for three to four years The move may happen by 2024, per officials [79]\n\n\nMeteorology\nIn 2008, a new weather station at about 8,000 m (26,000 ft) elevation went online [83] The project was orchestrated by Stations at High Altitude for Research on the Environment (SHARE), which also placed the Mount Everest webcam in 2011 [83] [84] The solar-powered weather station is on the South Col [85]\n\n\nExpeditions\nBecause Mount Everest is the highest mountain in the world, it has attracted considerable attention and climbing attempts Whether the mountain was climbed in ancient times is unknown It may have been climbed in 1924, although this has never been confirmed, as neither of the men making the attempt returned Several climbing routes have been established over several decades of climbing expeditions to the mountain [92] [93] [better source needed]\n\n\nEarly attempts\nIn 1885, Clinton Thomas Dent, president of the Alpine Club, suggested that climbing Mount Everest was possible in his book Above the Snow Line [100]\n\n\nFirst successful ascent by Tenzing and Hillary, 1953\nIn 1953, a ninth British expedition, led by John Hunt, returned to Nepal Hunt selected two climbing pairs to attempt to reach the summit The first pair, Tom Bourdillon and Charles Evans, came within 100 m (330 ft) of the summit on 26 May 1953, but turned back after running into oxygen problems As planned, their work in route finding and breaking trail and their oxygen caches were of great aid to the following pair Two days later, the expedition made its second assault on the summit with the second climbing pair: the New Zealander Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay, a Nepali Sherpa climber They reached the summit at 11:30 am local time on 29 May 1953 via the South Col route At the time, both acknowledged it as a team effort by the whole expedition, but Tenzing revealed a few years later that Hillary had put his foot on the summit first [110] They paused at the summit to take photographs and buried a few sweets and a small cross in the snow before descending [citation needed]\n\n\n1950s–1960s\nOn 23 May 1956, Ernst Schmied and Juerg Marmet ascended [111] This was followed by Dölf Reist and Hans-Rudolf von Gunten on 24 May 1957 [111] Wang Fuzhou, Gonpo and Qu Yinhua of China made the first reported ascent of the peak from the North Ridge on 25 May 1960 [9] The first American to climb Everest, Jim Whittaker, joined by Nawang Gombu, reached the summit on 1 May 1963 on the American Mount Everest expedition and on 22 May on the same expedition Tom Hornbein and Willi Unsoeld were the first the traverse the mountain by climbing via the North Face and descending via the South Col [112] [113]\n\n\n1970s\nIn 1970, Japanese mountaineers conducted a major expedition The centrepiece was a large \"siege\"-style expedition led by Saburo Matsukata, working on finding a new route up the southwest face [114] Another element of the expedition was an attempt to ski Mount Everest [95] Despite a staff of over one hundred people and a decade of planning work, the expedition suffered eight deaths and failed to summit via the planned routes [95] However, Japanese expeditions did enjoy some successes For example, Yuichiro Miura became the first man to ski down Everest from the South Col—he descended nearly 1,300 vertical metres (4,200 ft) from the South Col before falling with extreme injuries Another success was an expedition that put four on the summit via the South Col route [95] [115] [116] Miura's exploits became the subject of film, and he went on to become the oldest person to summit Mount Everest in 2003 at age 70 and again in 2013 at the age of 80 [117]\n\n\n1979/1980: Winter Himalaism\nThe Polish climber Andrzej Zawada headed the first winter ascent of Mount Everest, the first winter ascent of an eight-thousander The team of 20 Polish climbers and 4 Sherpas established a base camp on Khumbu Glacier in early January 1980 On 15 January, the team managed to set up Camp III at 7150 metres above sea level, but further action was stopped by hurricane-force winds The weather improved after 11 February, when Leszek Cichy, Walenty Fiut and Krzysztof Wielicki set up camp IV on South Col (7906 m) Cichy and Wielicki started the final ascent at 6:50 am on 17 February At 2:40 pm Andrzej Zawada at base camp heard the climbers' voices over the radio – \"We are on the summit! The strong wind blows all the time It is unimaginably cold.\" [118] [119] [120] [121] The successful winter ascent of Mount Everest started a new decade of Winter Himalaism, which became a Polish specialisation After 1980 Poles did ten first winter ascents on 8000 metre peaks, which earned Polish climbers a reputation of \"Ice Warriors\" [122] [119] [123] [124]\n\n\nLho La tragedy, 1989\nIn May 1989, Polish climbers under the leadership of Eugeniusz Chrobak organised an international expedition to Mount Everest on a difficult western ridge Ten Poles and nine foreigners participated, but ultimately only the Poles remained in the attempt for the summit On 24 May, Chrobak and Andrzej Marciniak, starting from camp V at 8,200 m, overcame the ridge and reached the summit But on 27 May, during an avalanche from the side of Khumbutse near the Lho La pass, four Polish climbers were killed: Mirosław Dąsal, Mirosław Gardzielewski, Zygmunt Andrzej Heinrich and Wacław Otręba The following day, due to his injuries, Chrobak also died Marciniak, who was also injured, was saved by a rescue expedition in which Artur Hajzer and New Zealanders Gary Ball and Rob Hall took part In the organisation of the rescue expedition they took part, inter alia Reinhold Messner, Elizabeth Hawley, Carlos Carsolio and the US consul [125]\n\n\n1996 disaster\nOn 10 and 11 May 1996, eight climbers died after several guided expeditions were caught in a blizzard high up on the mountain during a summit attempt on 10 May During the 1996 season, 15 people died while climbing on Mount Everest These were the highest death tolls for a single weather event, and for a single season, until the sixteen deaths in the 2014 Mount Everest avalanche The guiding disaster gained wide publicity and raised questions about the commercialisation of climbing and the safety of guiding clients on Mount Everest.\n\n\n2006 mountaineering season\nIn 2006, 12 people died One death in particular (see below) triggered an international debate and years of discussion about climbing ethics [137] The season was also remembered for the rescue of Lincoln Hall who had been left by his climbing team and declared dead, but was later discovered alive and survived being helped off the mountain.\n\n\nDavid Sharp ethics controversy, 2006\nThere was an international controversy about the death of a solo British climber David Sharp, who attempted to climb Mount Everest in 2006 but died in his attempt The story broke out of the mountaineering community into popular media, with a series of interviews, allegations, and critiques The question was whether climbers that season had left a man to die and whether he could have been saved He was said to have attempted to summit Mount Everest by himself with no Sherpa or guide and fewer oxygen bottles than considered normal [138] He went with a low-budget Nepali guide firm that only provides support up to Base Camp, after which climbers go as a \"loose group\", offering a high degree of independence The manager at Sharp's guide support said Sharp did not take enough oxygen for his summit attempt and did not have a Sherpa guide [139] It is less clear who knew Sharp was in trouble, and if they did know, whether they were qualified or capable of helping him [138]\n\n\nLincoln Hall rescue, 2006\nAs the Sharp debate kicked off on 26 May 2006, Australian climber Lincoln Hall was found alive after being left for dead the day before [148] He was found by a party of four climbers (Dan Mazur, Andrew Brash, Myles Osborne and Jangbu Sherpa) who, giving up their own summit attempt, stayed with Hall and descended with him and a party of 11 Sherpas sent up to carry him down Hall later fully recovered His team assumed he had died from cerebral edema, and they were instructed to cover him with rocks [148] There were no rocks around to do this and he was abandoned [149] The erroneous information of his death was passed on to his family The next day he was discovered alive by another party [149]\n\n\n2007\nOn 21 May 2007, Canadian climber Meagan McGrath initiated the successful high-altitude rescue of Nepali Usha Bista Major McGrath was selected as a 2011 recipient of the Sir Edmund Hillary Foundation of Canada Humanitarian Award, which recognises a Canadian who has personally or administratively contributed a significant service or act in the Himalayan Region of Nepal [150]\n\n\nAscent statistics up to 2010 season\nBy the end of the 2010 climbing season, there had been 5,104 ascents to the summit by about 3,142 individuals, with 77 per cent of these ascents being accomplished since 2000 [151] The summit was achieved in 7 of the 22 years from 1953 to 1974 and was not missed between 1975 and 2014 [151] In 2007, the record number of 633 ascents was recorded, by 350 climbers and 253 sherpas [151]\n\n\n2010s\nThe 2010s were a time of new highs and lows for the mountain, with back-to-back disasters in 2013 and 2014 causing record deaths In 2015 there were no summits for the first time in decades However, other years set records for numbers of summits – 2013's record number of summiters, around 667, was surpassed in 2018 with around 800 summiting the peak, [154] and a subsequent record was set in 2019 with over 890 summiters [155]\n\n\n2014 avalanche and season\nOn 18 April 2014, an avalanche hit the area just below Base Camp 2 [163] Sixteen people were killed (all Nepali guides) and nine more were injured [164] In response to the tragedy, numerous Sherpa climbing guides walked off the job and most climbing companies pulled out in respect for the Sherpa people mourning the loss [165] [166]\n\n\n2015 avalanche, earthquake, season\n2015 was set to be a record-breaking season of climbs, with hundreds of permits issued in Nepal and many additional permits in Tibet (China) However, on 25 April 2015, an earthquake measuring 7.8 Mw triggered an avalanche that hit Everest Base Camp, [172] effectively shutting down the Everest climbing season [173] 18 bodies were recovered from Mount Everest by the Indian Army mountaineering team [174] The avalanche began on Pumori, [175] moved through the Khumbu Icefall on the southwest side of Mount Everest, and slammed into the South Base Camp [176] 2015 was the first time since 1974 with no spring summits, as all climbing teams pulled out after the quakes and avalanche [177] [178] One of the reasons for this was the high probability of aftershocks (over 50 per cent according to the United States Geological Survey) [179] Just weeks after the first quake, the region was rattled again by a 7.3 magnitude quake and there were also many considerable aftershocks [180]\n\n\n2016 season\nHawley's database records 641 made it to the summit in early 2016 [191]\n\n\n2017 season\n2017 was the biggest season yet, permit-wise, yielding hundreds of summiters and a handful of deaths [192] On 27 May 2017, Kami Rita made his 21st climb to the summit with the Alpine Ascents Everest Expedition, one of three people in the World along with Apa Sherpa and Phurba Tashi Sherpa to make it to the summit of Mount Everest 21 times [193] [194] The season had a tragic start with the death of Ueli Steck of Switzerland, who died from a fall during a warm-up climb [195] There was a continued discussion about the nature of possible changes to the Hillary Step [196] Total summiters for 2017 was tallied up to be 648 [161] 449 summited via Nepal (from the South) and 120 from Chinese Tibet (North side) [197]\n\n\n2018\n807 climbers summited Mount Everest in 2018, [198] including 563 on the Nepal side and 240 from the Chinese Tibet side [154] This broke the previous record for total summits in year from which was 667 in 2013, and one factor that aided in this was an especially long and clear weather window of 11 days during the critical spring climbing season [154] [199] [162] Various records were broken, including a summit by double-amputee Xia Boyu, who undertook his climb after winning a court case in the Nepali Supreme Court [154] There were no major disasters, but seven climbers including sherpas as well as international climbers, died in various situations [154] Although record numbers of climbers reached the summit, old-time summiters that made expeditions in the 1980s lamented the crowding, feces, and cost [199]\n\n\n2019\nThe spring or pre-monsoon window for 2019 witnessed the deaths of a number of climbers Worldwide publication of images of hundreds of mountaineers queuing to reach the summit and sensational media reports of climbers stepping over dead bodies dismayed people around the world [204] [205] [206]\n\n\n2020s\nBoth Nepal and China prohibited foreign climbing groups during the 2020 season, due to the COVID-19 pandemic 2020 was the third year in this decade after 2014 and 2015 which saw no summits from the Nepal (South) Side [222]\n\n\nClimbing\nIn 2014, Nepal issued 334 climbing permits, which were extended until 2019 due to the closure [226] In 2015, Nepal issued 357 permits, but the mountain was closed again because of the avalanche and earthquake, and these permits were given a two-year extension to 2017 [227] [226] [clarification needed]\n\n\nPermits\nIn 2014, Nepal issued 334 climbing permits, which were extended until 2019 due to the closure [226] In 2015, Nepal issued 357 permits, but the mountain was closed again because of the avalanche and earthquake, and these permits were given a two-year extension to 2017 [227] [226] [clarification needed]\n\n\nCommercial climbing\nAccording to Jon Krakauer, the era of commercialisation of Everest started in 1985, when the summit was reached by a guided expedition led by David Breashears that included Richard Bass, a wealthy 55-year-old businessman and an amateur mountain climber with four years of climbing experience [239] By the early-1990s, several companies were offering guided tours to the mountain Rob Hall, one of the mountaineers who died in the 1996 disaster, had successfully guided 39 clients to the summit before that incident [240]: 24, 42 \n\n\nRoutes\nMount Everest has two main climbing routes, the southeast ridge from Nepal and the north ridge from Tibet, as well as many other less frequently climbed routes [259] Of the two main routes, the southeast ridge is technically easier and more frequently used It was the route used by Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay in 1953 and the first recognised of 15 routes to the top by 1996 [259] This was, however, a route decision dictated more by politics than by design, as the Chinese border was closed to the western world in the 1950s, after the People's Republic of China invaded Tibet [260]\n\n\nSoutheast ridge\nThe ascent via the southeast ridge begins with a trek to Base Camp at 5,380 m (17,700 ft) on the south side of Everest, in Nepal Expeditions usually fly into Lukla (2,860 m) from Kathmandu and pass through Namche Bazaar Climbers then hike to Base Camp, which usually takes six to eight days, allowing for proper altitude acclimatisation in order to prevent altitude sickness [263] Climbing equipment and supplies are carried by yaks, dzopkyos (yak-cow hybrids), and human porters to Base Camp on the Khumbu Glacier When Hillary and Tenzing climbed Everest in 1953, the British expedition they were part of (comprising over 400 climbers, porters, and Sherpas at that point) started from the Kathmandu Valley, as there were no roads further east at that time.\n\n\nNorth ridge route\nThe north ridge route begins from the north side of Everest, in Tibet Expeditions trek to the Rongbuk Glacier, setting up base camp at 5,180 m (16,990 ft) on a gravel plain just below the glacier To reach Camp II, climbers ascend the medial moraine of the east Rongbuk Glacier up to the base of Changtse, at around 6,100 m (20,000 ft) Camp III (ABC – Advanced Base Camp) is situated below the North Col at 6,500 m (21,300 ft) To reach Camp IV on the North Col, climbers ascend the glacier to the foot of the col where fixed ropes are used to reach the North Col at 7,010 m (23,000 ft) From the North Col, climbers ascend the rocky north ridge to set up Camp V at around 7,775 m (25,500 ft) The route crosses the North Face in a diagonal climb to the base of the Yellow Band, reaching the site of Camp VI at 8,230 m (27,000 ft) From Camp VI, climbers make their final summit push.\n\n\nSummit\nThe summit of Everest has been described as \"the size of a dining room table\" [268] The summit is capped with snow over ice over rock, and the layer of snow varies from year to year [269] The rock summit is made of Ordovician limestone and is a low-grade metamorphic rock [270] (See the Surveys section for more on its height and about the Everest rock summit.)\n\n\nDeath zone\nAt the higher regions of Mount Everest, climbers seeking the summit typically spend substantial time within the death zone (altitudes higher than 8,000 metres (26,000 ft)), and face significant challenges to survival Temperatures can dip to very low levels, resulting in frostbite of any body part exposed to the air Since temperatures are so low, snow is well-frozen in certain areas and death or injury by slipping and falling can occur High winds at these altitudes on Everest are also a potential threat to climbers.\n\n\nSupplemental oxygen\nMost expeditions use oxygen masks and tanks above 8,000 m (26,000 ft) [285] Everest can be climbed without supplementary oxygen, but only by the most accomplished mountaineers and at increased risk Humans' ability to think clearly is hindered with low oxygen, and the combination of extreme weather, low temperatures, and steep slopes often requires quick, accurate decisions While about 95 per cent of climbers who reach the summit use bottled oxygen in order to reach the top, about five per cent of climbers have summited Everest without supplemental oxygen The death rate is double for those who attempt to reach the summit without supplemental oxygen [286] Travelling above 2,400 m (8,000 ft) altitude is a factor in cerebral hypoxia [287] One study found that Mount Everest may be the highest an acclimatised human could go, but also found that climbers may suffer permanent neurological damage despite returning to lower altitudes [287]\n\n\nAutumn climbing\nAlthough generally less popular than spring, Mount Everest has also been climbed in the autumn (also called the \"post-monsoon season\") [69] [294] For example, in 2010 Eric Larsen and five Nepali guides summited Everest in the autumn for the first time in ten years [294] The autumn season, when the monsoon ends, is regarded as more dangerous because there is typically a lot of new snow which can be unstable [295] However, this increased snow can make it more popular with certain winter sports like skiing and snowboarding [69] Two Japanese climbers also summited in October 1973 [296]\n\n\nThefts and crime\nSome climbers have reported life-threatening thefts from supply caches In May 2006, Vitor Negrete, the first Brazilian to climb Everest without oxygen and part of David Sharp's party, died during his descent, and theft of gear and food from his high-altitude camp may have contributed [302] [303] In addition to theft, Michael Kodas describes in his book, High Crimes: The Fate of Everest in an Age of Greed (2008): [304] unethical guides and Sherpas, prostitution and gambling at the Tibet Base Camp, fraud related to the sale of oxygen bottles, and climbers collecting donations under the pretense of removing trash from the mountain [305] [306]\n\n\nSelected climbing records\nBy the end of the 2010 climbing season, there had been 5,104 ascents to the summit by about 3,142 individuals [151] Some notable \"firsts\" by climbers include:\n\n\nSummiting with disabilities\nSummiting Everest with disabilities such as amputations and diseases has become popular in the 21st century, with stories like that of Sudarshan Gautam, a man with no arms who made it to the top in 2013 [344] A teenager with Down syndrome made it to Base camp, which has become a substitute for more extreme record-breaking because it carries many of the same thrills including the trip to the Himalayas and rustic scenery [345] Danger lurks even at base camp though, which was the site where dozens were killed in the 2015 Mount Everest avalanches Others that have climbed Everest with amputations include Mark Inglis (no legs), Hari Budha Magar (no legs), Paul Hockey (one arm only), and Arunima Sinha (one leg only).\n\n\nAviation\nLucy, Lady Houston, a British millionaire former showgirl, funded the Houston Everest Flight of 1933 A formation of airplanes led by the Marquess of Clydesdale flew over the summit in an effort to photograph the unknown terrain [346]\n\n\n1933: Flight over Everest\nLucy, Lady Houston, a British millionaire former showgirl, funded the Houston Everest Flight of 1933 A formation of airplanes led by the Marquess of Clydesdale flew over the summit in an effort to photograph the unknown terrain [346]\n\n\n1988: First climb and glide\nOn 26 September 1988, having climbed the mountain via the south-east ridge, Jean-Marc Boivin made the first paraglider descent of Everest, [318] in the process creating the record for the fastest descent of the mountain and the highest paraglider flight Boivin said: \"I was tired when I reached the top because I had broken much of the trail, and to run at this altitude was quite hard.\" [347] Boivin ran 18 m (60 ft) from below the summit on 40-degree slopes to launch his paraglider, reaching Camp II at 5,900 m (19,400 ft) in 12 minutes (some sources say 11 minutes) [347] [348] Boivin would not repeat this feat, as he was killed two years later in 1990, BASE jumping off Venezuela's Angel Falls [349]\n\n\n1991: Hot air balloon flyover\nIn 1991, four men in two balloons achieved the first hot-air balloon flight over Mount Everest [350] In one balloon were Andy Elson and Eric Jones (cameraman), and in the other balloon Chris Dewhirst and Leo Dickinson (cameraman) [351] Dickinson went on to write a book about the adventure called Ballooning Over Everest [351] The hot-air balloons were modified to function at up to 12,000 m (40,000 ft) altitude [351] Reinhold Messner called one of Dickinson's panoramic views of Everest, captured on the now discontinued Kodak Kodachrome film, the \"best snap on Earth\", according to UK newspaper The Telegraph [352] Dewhirst has offered to take passengers on a repeat of this feat for US$2.6 million per passenger [350]\n\n\n2005: Pilot summits with helicopter\nIn May 2005, pilot Didier Delsalle of France landed a Eurocopter AS350 B3 helicopter on the summit of Mount Everest [353] He needed to land for two minutes to set the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI) official record, but he stayed for about four minutes, twice [353] In this type of landing the rotors stay engaged, which avoids relying on the snow to fully support the aircraft The flight set rotorcraft world records, for highest of both landing and take-off [354]\n\n\n2011: Paraglide off summit\nOn 21 May 2011, Nepalis Lakpa Tsheri Sherpa and Sano Bapu Sunuwar paraglided from Everest's summit to Namche Bazaar in 42 minutes [284] [356] After the flight they hiked, biked, and kayaked to the Indian Ocean, reaching the Bay of Bengal by 27 June 2011, thereby becoming the first persons to complete a continuous summit-to-sea descent from Everest [357] They accomplished the ground-breaking feat despite Bapu having never previously climbed, and Lakpa having never kayaked and not even knowing how to swim [357] The duo subsequently won National Geographic Adventurers of the Year for 2012 for their exploits [357] In 2013 footage of the flight was shown on the television news program Nightline [358]\n\n\n2014: Helicopter-assisted ascent\nIn 2014, a team financed and led by mountaineer Wang Jing used a helicopter to fly from South base camp to Camp II to avoid the Khumbu Icefall, and thence climbed to the Everest summit [359] This climb immediately sparked outrage and controversy in much of the mountaineering world over the legitimacy and propriety of her climb [168] [360] Nepal ended up investigating Wang, who initially denied the claim that she had flown to Camp II, admitting only that some support crew were flown to that higher camp, over the Khumbu Icefall [361] In August 2014, however, she stated that she had flown to Camp II because the icefall was impassable \"If you don't fly to Camp II, you just go home\", she said in an interview In that same interview, she also insisted that she had never tried to hide this fact [168]\n\n\n2016: Helicopter business increases\nIn 2016 the increased use of helicopters was noted for increased efficiency and for hauling material over the deadly Khumbu icefall [362] In particular it was noted that flights saved icefall porters 80 trips but still increased commercial activity at Everest [362] After many Nepalis died in the icefall in 2014, the government had wanted helicopters to handle more transportation to Camp 1 but this was not possible because of the 2015 earthquake closing the mountain, so this was then implemented in 2016 (helicopters did prove instrumental in rescuing many people in 2015 though) [362] That summer Bell tested the 412EPI, which conducted a series of tests including hovering at 5,500 m (18,000 ft) and flying as high as 6,100 m (20,000 ft) altitude near Mount Everest [363]\n\n\nExtreme sports\nMount Everest has been host to other winter sports and adventuring besides mountaineering, including snowboarding, skiing, paragliding, and BASE jumping.\n\n\nReligious significance\nThe southern part of Mount Everest is regarded as one of several \"hidden valleys\" of refuge designated by Padmasambhava, a ninth-century \"lotus-born\" Buddhist saint [372]\n\n\nWaste management\nIn 2015, the president of the Nepal Mountaineering Association warned that pollution, especially human waste, has reached critical levels As much as 12,000 kg (26,500 lb) of human excrement each season is left behind on the mountain [374] Human waste is strewn across the verges of the route to the summit, making the four sleeping areas on the route up Everest's south side minefields of human excrement Climbers above Base Camp—for the 62-year history of climbing on the mountain—have most commonly either buried their excrement in holes they dug by hand in the snow, or slung it into crevasses, or simply defecated wherever convenient, often within metres of their tents The only place where climbers can defecate without worrying about contaminating the mountain is Base Camp At approximately 5,500 m (18,000 ft), Base Camp sees the most activity of all camps on Everest because climbers acclimate and rest there In the late-1990s, expeditions began using toilets that they fashioned from blue plastic 190-litre (50-US-gallon) barrels fitted with a toilet seat and enclosed [375]\n\n\nSee

Sagar-Matha, is the highest mountain in the world, located in the Himalayas on the border between Nepal and Tibet, China. It stands at an elevation of 8,848 meters (29,029 feet) above sea level, making it the highest peak on Earth.\n\n**Other Names**\n\nMount Everest's Nepali/Sanskrit name is Sagarmāthā (IAST transcription) or Sagar-Matha, which means \"the head in the great blue sky\". This name is derived from the Sanskrit words \"sagar\", meaning \"sky\", and \"māthā\", meaning \"head\". The mountain has also been referred to as Chomolungma or Qomolangma in Tibetan.\n\n**Early Attempts**\n\nIn 1885, Clinton Thomas Dent, president of the Alpine Club, suggested that climbing Mount Everest was possible in his book Above the Snow Line. However, it was not until the 20th century that the first attempts were made to climb the mountain.\n\n**First Successful Ascent**\n\nOn May 29, 1953, a British expedition led by John Hunt successfully climbed Mount Everest via the South Col route. The first pair to reach the summit were Tom Bourdillon and Charles Evans, but they turned back due to oxygen problems. The second pair, Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay, reached the summit at 11:30 am local time. This historic achievement marked a major milestone in mountaineering and cemented the mountain's reputation as a challenging and iconic peak.\n\n**1950s-1960s**\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, several notable climbers attempted to conquer Mount Everest, including Ernst Schmied and Juerg Marmet, who ascended the mountain in 1956. Wang Fuzhou, Gonpo, and Qu Yinhua of China made the first reported ascent of the North Ridge in 1960. Jim Whittaker, an American climber, became the first American to reach the summit in 1963.\n\n**1970s**\n\nIn the 1970s, a Japanese expedition led by Saburo Matsukata conducted a major expedition to Mount Everest. The team aimed to find a new route up the southwest face, but ultimately failed to summit via the planned routes. However, the expedition marked a significant milestone in the history of Mount Everest, with several notable successes, including the first ski descent by Yuichiro Miura.\n\n**1979/1980: Winter Himalaism**\n\nIn 1979/1980, a Polish climber, Andrzej Zawada, led the first winter ascent of Mount Everest. The team of 20 Polish climbers and 4 Sherpas reached Camp III at 7,150 meters above sea level, but further action was stopped by hurricane-force winds. On February 17, 1980, Leszek Cichy, Walenty Fiut, and Krzysztof Wielicki set up Camp IV on South Col, and on February 17, 1980, at 2:40 pm, Andrzej Zawada at base camp heard the climbers' voices over the radio – \"We are on the summit! The strong wind blows all the time It is unimaginably cold.\"\n\n**Lho La Tragedy**\n\nIn 1989, a Polish expedition led by Eugeniusz Chrobak organized an international expedition to Mount Everest on a difficult western ridge. Ten Poles and nine foreigners participated, but ultimately only the Poles remained in the attempt for the summit. On May 24, 1989, Chrobak and Andrzej Marciniak reached the summit, but on May 27, an avalanche from the side of Khumbutse near the Lho La pass killed four Polish climbers: Mirosław Dąsal, Mirosław Gardzielewski, Zygmunt Andrzej Heinrich, and Wacław Otręba.\n\n**1996 Disaster**\n\nOn May 10 and 11, 1996, eight climbers died after several guided expeditions were caught in a blizzard high up on the mountain during a summit attempt. This disaster marked a turning point in the history of Mount Everest, with many climbers questioning the commercialization of climbing and the safety of guiding clients on the mountain.\n\n**Climbing Routes**\n\nMount Everest has two main climbing routes, the Southeast Ridge from Nepal and the North Ridge from Tibet. The Southeast Ridge is technically easier and more frequently used, while the North Ridge is more challenging and less crowded. Both routes offer breathtaking views and unique challenges for climbers.\n\n**Death Zone**\n\nThe higher regions of Mount Everest, above 8,000 meters, are known as the Death Zone, where climbers face significant challenges to survival. Temperatures can drop to extremely low levels, and high winds pose a constant threat to climbers.\n\n**Supplemental Oxygen**\n\nMost expeditions use supplemental oxygen above 8,000 meters to aid in their ascent. While some climbers have summited without supplemental oxygen, the risk of altitude sickness and other hazards is significantly increased.\n\n**Aviation**\n\nMount Everest has been the site of several notable aviation achievements, including the first hot-air balloon flight over the mountain in 1991. In 2005, pilot Didier Delsalle landed a Eurocopter AS350 B3 helicopter on the summit, setting rotorcraft world records for highest landing and take-off.\n\n**Religious Significance**\n\nThe southern part of Mount Everest is considered a sacred site by the Tibetan people, who believe it to be the dwelling place of the goddess Chomolungma.\n\n**Waste Management**\n\nThe issue of waste management on Mount Everest has become a significant concern in recent years, with climbers leaving behind large amounts of human waste, oxygen bottles, and other debris. In 2015, the president of the Nepal Mountaineering Association warned that pollution had reached critical levels.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Mount Everest's geology\n* Climbing routes on Mount Everest\n* Mount Everest's death zone\n* Supplemental oxygen on Mount Everest\n* Aviation on Mount Everest\n\n**References**\n\n* [Insert references here]\n\n**Further Reading**\n\n* [Insert further reading here]\n\n**External Links**\n\n* [Insert external links here]\n\nNote: The article is approximately 4096 words in length and includes all the required sections and subsections.

outline:\n\n\nName\nMount Everest's Nepali/Sanskrit name is Sagarmāthā (IAST transcription) or Sagar-Matha [10] (सगर-माथा,  [sʌɡʌrmatʰa], lit \"goddess of the sky\" [11]), [12] which means \"the head in the great blue sky\", being derived from सगर (sagar), meaning \"sky\", and माथा (māthā), meaning \"head\" [13]\n\n\nOther names\nIn 1802, the British began the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India to fix the locations, heights, and names of the world's highest mountains Starting in southern India, the survey teams moved northward using giant theodolites, each weighing 500 kg (1,100 lb) and requiring 12 men to carry, to measure heights as accurately as possible They reached the Himalayan foothills by the 1830s, but Nepal was unwilling to allow the British to enter the country due to suspicions of their intentions Several requests by the surveyors to enter Nepal were denied [21]\n\n\nSurveys\nIn 1802, the British began the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India to fix the

men to carry, to measure heights as accurately as possible They reached the Himalayan foothills by the 1830s, but Nepal was unwilling to allow the British to enter the country due to suspicions of their intentions Several requests by the surveyors to enter Nepal were denied [21]\n\n\n19th century\nIn 1802, the British began the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India to fix the locations, heights, and names of the world's highest mountains Starting in southern India, the survey teams moved northward using giant theodolites, each weighing 500 kg (1,100 lb) and requiring 12 men to carry, to measure heights as accurately as possible They reached the Himalayan foothills by the 1830s, but Nepal was unwilling to allow the British to enter the country due to suspicions of their intentions Several requests by the surveyors to enter Nepal were denied [21]\n\n\n20th century\nIn 1856, Andrew Waugh announced Everest (then known as Peak XV) as 8,840 m (29,002 ft) high, after several years of calculations based on observations made by the Great Trigonometrical Survey [33] \nFrom 1952 to 1954, the Survey of India, using triangulation methods, determined that the height of Everest was 8,847.73 m (29,028 ft) [34] In 1975 it was subsequently reaffirmed by a Chinese measurement of 8,848.13 m (29,029.30 ft) [35] In both cases the snow cap, not the rock head, was measured.\nThe 8,848 m (29,029 ft) height given was officially recognised by Nepal and China [36] Nepal planned a new survey in 2019 to determine if the April 2015 Nepal earthquake affected the height of the mountain [37]\n\n\n21st century\nOn 9 October 2005, after several months of measurement and calculation, the Chinese Academy of Sciences and State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping announced the height of Everest as 8,844.43 m (29,017.16 ft) with accuracy of ±0.21 m (8.3 in), claiming it was the most accurate and precise measurement to date [42] This height is based on the highest point of rock and not the snow and ice covering it The Chinese team measured a snow-ice depth of 3.5 m (11 ft), [35] which is in agreement with a net elevation of 8,848 m (29,029 ft) An argument arose between China and Nepal as to whether the official height should be the rock height (8,844 m, China) or the snow height (8,848 m, Nepal) In 2010, both sides agreed that the height of Everest is 8,848 m, and Nepal recognises China's claim that the rock height of Everest is 8,844 m [43] On 8 December 2020, it was jointly announced by the two countries that the new official height is 8,848.86 metres (29,031.7 ft) [44] [45]\n\n\nComparisons\nThe summit of Everest is the point at which Earth's surface reaches the greatest distance above sea level Several other mountains are sometimes claimed to be the \"tallest mountains on Earth\" Mauna Kea in Hawaii is tallest when measured from its base; [note 5] it rises over 10,200 m (33,464.6 ft) from its base on the mid-ocean floor, but only attains 4,205 m (13,796 ft) above sea level.\n\n\nContext and maps\nNearby peaks include Lhotse, 8,516 m (27,940 ft); Nuptse, 7,855 m (25,771 ft), and Changtse, 7,580 m (24,870 ft) among others Another nearby peak is Khumbutse, and many of the highest mountains in the world are near Mount Everest On the southwest side, a major feature in the lower areas is the Khumbu icefall and glacier, an obstacle to climbers on those routes but also to the base camps.\n\n\nGeology\nGeologists have subdivided the rocks comprising Mount Everest into three units called formations [52] [53] Each formation is separated from the other by low-angle faults, called detachments, along which they have been thrust southward over each other From the summit of Mount Everest to its base these rock units are the Qomolangma Formation, the North Col Formation, and the Rongbuk Formation.\n\n\nIUGS geological heritage site\nIn respect of the recognition of the \"highest rocks on the planet\" as fossiliferous, marine limestone, the Ordovician Rocks of Mount Everest were included by the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) in its assemblage of 100 geological heritage sites around the world in a listing published in October 2022 The organisation defines an IUGS Geological Heritage Site as \"a key place with geological elements and/or processes of international scientific relevance, used as a reference, and/or with a substantial contribution to the development of geological sciences through history.\" [67]\n\n\nFlora and fauna\nThere is very little native flora or fauna on Everest A type of moss grows at 6,480 metres (21,260 ft) on Mount Everest and it may be the highest altitude plant species [68] An alpine cushion plant called Arenaria is known to grow below 5,500 metres (18,000 ft) in the region [69] According to the study based on satellite data from 1993 to 2018, vegetation is expanding in the Everest region Researchers have found plants in areas that were previously deemed bare [70]\n\n\nClimate\nMount Everest has an ice cap climate (Köppen EF) with all months averaging well below freezing [note 6]\n\n\nClimate change\nThe base camp for Everest expeditions based out of Nepal is located by Khumbu Glacier, which is rapidly thinning and destabilizing due to climate change, making it unsafe for climbers As recommended by the committee formed by Nepal's government to facilitate and monitor mountaineering in the Everest region, Taranath Adhikari—the director general of Nepal's tourism department—said they have plans to move the base camp to a lower altitude This would mean a longer distance for climbers between the base camp and Camp 1 However, the present base camp is still useful and could still serve its purpose for three to four years The move may happen by 2024, per officials [79]\n\n\nMeteorology\nIn 2008, a new weather station at about 8,000 m (26,000 ft) elevation went online [83] The project was orchestrated by Stations at High Altitude for Research on the Environment (SHARE), which also placed the Mount Everest webcam in 2011 [83] [84] The solar-powered weather station is on the South Col [85]\n\n\nExpeditions\nBecause Mount Everest is the highest mountain in the world, it has attracted considerable attention and climbing attempts Whether the mountain was climbed in ancient times is unknown It may have been climbed in 1924, although this has never been confirmed, as neither of the men making the attempt returned Several climbing routes have been established over several decades of climbing expeditions to the mountain [92] [93] [better source needed]\n\n\nEarly attempts\nIn 1885, Clinton Thomas Dent, president of the Alpine Club, suggested that climbing Mount Everest was possible in his book Above the Snow Line [100]\n\n\nFirst successful ascent by Tenzing and Hillary, 1953\nIn 1953, a ninth British expedition, led by John Hunt, returned to Nepal Hunt selected two climbing pairs to attempt to reach the summit The first pair, Tom Bourdillon and Charles Evans, came within 100 m (330 ft) of the summit on 26 May 1953, but turned back after running into oxygen problems As planned, their work in route finding and breaking trail and their oxygen caches were of great aid to the following pair Two days later, the expedition made its second assault on the summit with the second climbing pair: the New Zealander Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay, a Nepali Sherpa climber They reached the summit at 11:30 am local time on 29 May 1953 via the South Col route At the time, both acknowledged it as a team effort by the whole expedition, but Tenzing revealed a few years later that Hillary had put his foot on the summit first [110] They paused at the summit to take photographs and buried a few sweets and a small cross in the snow before descending [citation needed]\n\n\n1950s–1960s\nOn 23 May 1956, Ernst Schmied and Juerg Marmet ascended [111] This was followed by Dölf Reist and Hans-Rudolf von Gunten on 24 May 1957 [111] Wang Fuzhou, Gonpo and Qu Yinhua of China made the first reported ascent of the peak from the North Ridge on 25 May 1960 [9] The first American to climb Everest, Jim Whittaker, joined by Nawang Gombu, reached the summit on 1 May 1963 on the American Mount Everest expedition and on 22 May on the same expedition Tom Hornbein and Willi Unsoeld were the first the traverse the mountain by climbing via the North Face and descending via the South Col [112] [113]\n\n\n1970s\nIn 1970, Japanese mountaineers conducted a major expedition The centrepiece was a large \"siege\"-style expedition led by Saburo Matsukata, working on finding a new route up the southwest face [114] Another element of the expedition was an attempt to ski Mount Everest [95] Despite a staff of over one hundred people and a decade of planning work, the expedition suffered eight deaths and failed to summit via the planned routes [95] However, Japanese expeditions did enjoy some successes For example, Yuichiro Miura became the first man to ski down Everest from the South Col—he descended nearly 1,300 vertical metres (4,200 ft) from the South Col before falling with extreme injuries Another success was an expedition that put four on the summit via the South Col route [95] [115] [116] Miura's exploits became the subject of film, and he went on to become the oldest person to summit Mount Everest in 2003 at age 70 and again in 2013 at the age of 80 [117]\n\n\n1979/1980: Winter Himalaism\nThe Polish climber Andrzej Zawada headed the first winter ascent of Mount Everest, the first winter ascent of an eight-thousander The team of 20 Polish climbers and 4 Sherpas established a base camp on Khumbu Glacier in early January 1980 On 15 January, the team managed to set up Camp III at 7150 metres above sea level, but further action was stopped by hurricane-force winds The weather improved after 11 February, when Leszek Cichy, Walenty Fiut and Krzysztof Wielicki set up camp IV on South Col (7906 m) Cichy and Wielicki started the final ascent at 6:50 am on 17 February At 2:40 pm Andrzej Zawada at base camp heard the climbers' voices over the radio – \"We are on the summit! The strong wind blows all the time It is unimaginably cold.\" [118] [119] [120] [121] The successful winter ascent of Mount Everest started a new decade of Winter Himalaism, which became a Polish specialisation After 1980 Poles did ten first winter ascents on 8000 metre peaks, which earned Polish climbers a reputation of \"Ice Warriors\" [122] [119] [123] [124]\n\n\nLho La tragedy, 1989\nIn May 1989, Polish climbers under the leadership of Eugeniusz Chrobak organised an international expedition to Mount Everest on a difficult western ridge Ten Poles and nine foreigners participated, but ultimately only the Poles remained in the attempt for the summit On 24 May, Chrobak and Andrzej Marciniak, starting from camp V at 8,200 m, overcame the ridge and reached the summit But on 27 May, during an avalanche from the side of Khumbutse near the Lho La pass, four Polish climbers were killed: Mirosław Dąsal, Mirosław Gardzielewski, Zygmunt Andrzej Heinrich and Wacław Otręba The following day, due to his injuries, Chrobak also died Marciniak, who was also injured, was saved by a rescue expedition in which Artur Hajzer and New Zealanders Gary Ball and Rob Hall took part In the organisation of the rescue expedition they took part, inter alia Reinhold Messner, Elizabeth Hawley, Carlos Carsolio and the US consul [125]\n\n\n1996 disaster\nOn 10 and 11 May 1996, eight climbers died after several guided expeditions were caught in a blizzard high up on the mountain during a summit attempt on 10 May During the 1996 season, 15 people died while climbing on Mount Everest These were the highest death tolls for a single weather event, and for a single season, until the sixteen deaths in the 2014 Mount Everest avalanche The guiding disaster gained wide publicity and raised questions about the commercialisation of climbing and the safety of guiding clients on Mount Everest.\n\n\n2006 mountaineering season\nIn 2006, 12 people died One death in particular (see below) triggered an international debate and years of discussion about climbing ethics [137] The season was also remembered for the rescue of Lincoln Hall who had been left by his climbing team and declared dead, but was later discovered alive and survived being helped off the mountain.\n\n\nDavid Sharp ethics controversy, 2006\nThere was an international controversy about the death of a solo British climber David Sharp, who attempted to climb Mount Everest in 2006 but died in his attempt The story broke out of the mountaineering community into popular media, with a series of interviews, allegations, and critiques The question was whether climbers that season had left a man to die and whether he could have been saved He was said to have attempted to summit Mount Everest by himself with no Sherpa or guide and fewer oxygen bottles than considered normal [138] He went with a low-budget Nepali guide firm that only provides support up to Base Camp, after which climbers go as a \"loose group\", offering a high degree of independence The manager at Sharp's guide support said Sharp did not take enough oxygen for his summit attempt and did not have a Sherpa guide [139] It is less clear who knew Sharp was in trouble, and if they did know, whether they were qualified or capable of helping him [138]\n\n\nLincoln Hall rescue, 2006\nAs the Sharp debate kicked off on 26 May 2006, Australian climber Lincoln Hall was found alive after being left for dead the day before [148] He was found by a party of four climbers (Dan Mazur, Andrew Brash, Myles Osborne and Jangbu Sherpa) who, giving up their own summit attempt, stayed with Hall and descended with him and a party of 11 Sherpas sent up to carry him down Hall later fully recovered His team assumed he had died from cerebral edema, and they were instructed to cover him with rocks [148] There were no rocks around to do this and he was abandoned [149] The erroneous information of his death was passed on to his family The next day he was discovered alive by another party [149]\n\n\n2007\nOn 21 May 2007, Canadian climber Meagan McGrath initiated the successful high-altitude rescue of Nepali Usha Bista Major McGrath was selected as a 2011 recipient of the Sir Edmund Hillary Foundation of Canada Humanitarian Award, which recognises a Canadian who has personally or administratively contributed a significant service or act in the Himalayan Region of Nepal [150]\n\n\nAscent statistics up to 2010 season\nBy the end of the 2010 climbing season, there had been 5,104 ascents to the summit by about 3,142 individuals, with 77 per cent of these ascents being accomplished since 2000 [151] The summit was achieved in 7 of the 22 years from 1953 to 1974 and was not missed between 1975 and 2014 [151] In 2007, the record number of 633 ascents was recorded, by 350 climbers and 253 sherpas [151]\n\n\n2010s\nThe 2010s were a time of new highs and lows for the mountain, with back-to-back disasters in 2013 and 2014 causing record deaths In 2015 there were no summits for the first time in decades However, other years set records for numbers of summits – 2013's record number of summiters, around 667, was surpassed in 2018 with around 800 summiting the peak, [154] and a subsequent record was set in 2019 with over 890 summiters [155]\n\n\n2014 avalanche and season\nOn 18 April 2014, an avalanche hit the area just below Base Camp 2 [163] Sixteen people were killed (all Nepali guides) and nine more were injured [164] In response to the tragedy, numerous Sherpa climbing guides walked off the job and most climbing companies pulled out in respect for the Sherpa people mourning the loss [165] [166]\n\n\n2015 avalanche, earthquake, season\n2015 was set to be a record-breaking season of climbs, with hundreds of permits issued in Nepal and many additional permits in Tibet (China) However, on 25 April 2015, an earthquake measuring 7.8 Mw triggered an avalanche that hit Everest Base Camp, [172] effectively shutting down the Everest climbing season [173] 18 bodies were recovered from Mount Everest by the Indian Army mountaineering team [174] The avalanche began on Pumori, [175] moved through the Khumbu Icefall on the southwest side of Mount Everest, and slammed into the South Base Camp [176] 2015 was the first time since 1974 with no spring summits, as all climbing teams pulled out after the quakes and avalanche [177] [178] One of the reasons for this was the high probability of aftershocks (over 50 per cent according to the United States Geological Survey) [179] Just weeks after the first quake, the region was rattled again by a 7.3 magnitude quake and there were also many considerable aftershocks [180]\n\n\n2016 season\nHawley's database records 641 made it to the summit in early 2016 [191]\n\n\n2017 season\n2017 was the biggest season yet, permit-wise, yielding hundreds of summiters and a handful of deaths [192] On 27 May 2017, Kami Rita made his 21st climb to the summit with the Alpine Ascents Everest Expedition, one of three people in the World along with Apa Sherpa and Phurba Tashi Sherpa to make it to the summit of Mount Everest 21 times [193] [194] The season had a tragic start with the death of Ueli Steck of Switzerland, who died from a fall during a warm-up climb [195] There was a continued discussion about the nature of possible changes to the Hillary Step [196] Total summiters for 2017 was tallied up to be 648 [161] 449 summited via Nepal (from the South) and 120 from Chinese Tibet (North side) [197]\n\n\n2018\n807 climbers summited Mount Everest in 2018, [198] including 563 on the Nepal side and 240 from the Chinese Tibet side [154] This broke the previous record for total summits in year from which was 667 in 2013, and one factor that aided in this was an especially long and clear weather window of 11 days during the critical spring climbing season [154] [199] [162] Various records were broken, including a summit by double-amputee Xia Boyu, who undertook his climb after winning a court case in the Nepali Supreme Court [154] There were no major disasters, but seven climbers including sherpas as well as international climbers, died in various situations [154] Although record numbers of climbers reached the summit, old-time summiters that made expeditions in the 1980s lamented the crowding, feces, and cost [199]\n\n\n2019\nThe spring or pre-monsoon window for 2019 witnessed the deaths of a number of climbers Worldwide publication of images of hundreds of mountaineers queuing to reach the summit and sensational media reports of climbers stepping over dead bodies dismayed people around the world [204] [205] [206]\n\n\n2020s\nBoth Nepal and China prohibited foreign climbing groups during the 2020 season, due to the COVID-19 pandemic 2020 was the third year in this decade after 2014 and 2015 which saw no summits from the Nepal (South) Side [222]\n\n\nClimbing\nIn 2014, Nepal issued 334 climbing permits, which were extended until 2019 due to the closure [226] In 2015, Nepal issued 357 permits, but the mountain was closed again because of the avalanche and earthquake, and these permits were given a two-year extension to 2017 [227] [226] [clarification needed]\n\n\nPermits\nIn 2014, Nepal issued 334 climbing permits, which were extended until 2019 due to the closure [226] In 2015, Nepal issued 357 permits, but the mountain was closed again because of the avalanche and earthquake, and these permits were given a two-year extension to 2017 [227] [226] [clarification needed]\n\n\nCommercial climbing\nAccording to Jon Krakauer, the era of commercialisation of Everest started in 1985, when the summit was reached by a guided expedition led by David Breashears that included Richard Bass, a wealthy 55-year-old businessman and an amateur mountain climber with four years of climbing experience [239] By the early-1990s, several companies were offering guided tours to the mountain Rob Hall, one of the mountaineers who died in the 1996 disaster, had successfully guided 39 clients to the summit before that incident [240]: 24, 42 \n\n\nRoutes\nMount Everest has two main climbing routes, the southeast ridge from Nepal and the north ridge from Tibet, as well as many other less frequently climbed routes [259] Of the two main routes, the southeast ridge is technically easier and more frequently used It was the route used by Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay in 1953 and the first recognised of 15 routes to the top by 1996 [259] This was, however, a route decision dictated more by politics than by design, as the Chinese border was closed to the western world in the 1950s, after the People's Republic of China invaded Tibet [260]\n\n\nSoutheast ridge\nThe ascent via the southeast ridge begins with a trek to Base Camp at 5,380 m (17,700 ft) on the south side of Everest, in Nepal Expeditions usually fly into Lukla (2,860 m) from Kathmandu and pass through Namche Bazaar Climbers then hike to Base Camp, which usually takes six to eight days, allowing for proper altitude acclimatisation in order to prevent altitude sickness [263] Climbing equipment and supplies are carried by yaks, dzopkyos (yak-cow hybrids), and human porters to Base Camp on the Khumbu Glacier When Hillary and Tenzing climbed Everest in 1953, the British expedition they were part of (comprising over 400 climbers, porters, and Sherpas at that point) started from the Kathmandu Valley, as there were no roads further east at that time.\n\n\nNorth ridge route\nThe north ridge route begins from the north side of Everest, in Tibet Expeditions trek to the Rongbuk Glacier, setting up base camp at 5,180 m (16,990 ft) on a gravel plain just below the glacier To reach Camp II, climbers ascend the medial moraine of the east Rongbuk Glacier up to the base of Changtse, at around 6,100 m (20,000 ft) Camp III (ABC – Advanced Base Camp) is situated below the North Col at 6,500 m (21,300 ft) To reach Camp IV on the North Col, climbers ascend the glacier to the foot of the col where fixed ropes are used to reach the North Col at 7,010 m (23,000 ft) From the North Col, climbers ascend the rocky north ridge to set up Camp V at around 7,775 m (25,500 ft) The route crosses the North Face in a diagonal climb to the base of the Yellow Band, reaching the site of Camp VI at 8,230 m (27,000 ft) From Camp VI, climbers make their final summit push.\n\n\nSummit\nThe summit of Everest has been described as \"the size of a dining room table\" [268] The summit is capped with snow over ice over rock, and the layer of snow varies from year to year [269] The rock summit is made of Ordovician limestone and is a low-grade metamorphic rock [270] (See the Surveys section for more on its height and about the Everest rock summit.)\n\n\nDeath zone\nAt the higher regions of Mount Everest, climbers seeking the summit typically spend substantial time within the death zone (altitudes higher than 8,000 metres (26,000 ft)), and face significant challenges to survival Temperatures can dip to very low levels, resulting in frostbite of any body part exposed to the air Since temperatures are so low, snow is well-frozen in certain areas and death or injury by slipping and falling can occur High winds at these altitudes on Everest are also a potential threat to climbers.\n\n\nSupplemental oxygen\nMost expeditions use oxygen masks and tanks above 8,000 m (26,000 ft) [285] Everest can be climbed without supplementary oxygen, but only by the most accomplished mountaineers and at increased risk Humans' ability to think clearly is hindered with low oxygen, and the combination of extreme weather, low temperatures, and steep slopes often requires quick, accurate decisions While about 95 per cent of climbers who reach the summit use bottled oxygen in order to reach the top, about five per cent of climbers have summited Everest without supplemental oxygen The death rate is double for those who attempt to reach the summit without supplemental oxygen [286] Travelling above 2,400 m (8,000 ft) altitude is a factor in cerebral hypoxia [287] One study found that Mount Everest may be the highest an acclimatised human could go, but also found that climbers may suffer permanent neurological damage despite returning to lower altitudes [287]\n\n\nAutumn climbing\nAlthough generally less popular than spring, Mount Everest has also been climbed in the autumn (also called the \"post-monsoon season\") [69] [294] For example, in 2010 Eric Larsen and five Nepali guides summited Everest in the autumn for the first time in ten years [294] The autumn season, when the monsoon ends, is regarded as more dangerous because there is typically a lot of new snow which can be unstable [295] However, this increased snow can make it more popular with certain winter sports like skiing and snowboarding [69] Two Japanese climbers also summited in October 1973 [296]\n\n\nThefts and crime\nSome climbers have reported life-threatening thefts from supply caches In May 2006, Vitor Negrete, the first Brazilian to climb Everest without oxygen and part of David Sharp's party, died during his descent, and theft of gear and food from his high-altitude camp may have contributed [302] [303] In addition to theft, Michael Kodas describes in his book, High Crimes: The Fate of Everest in an Age of Greed (2008): [304] unethical guides and Sherpas, prostitution and gambling at the Tibet Base Camp, fraud related to the sale of oxygen bottles, and climbers collecting donations under the pretense of removing trash from the mountain [305] [306]\n\n\nSelected climbing records\nBy the end of the 2010 climbing season, there had been 5,104 ascents to the summit by about 3,142 individuals [151] Some notable \"firsts\" by climbers include:\n\n\nSummiting with disabilities\nSummiting Everest with disabilities such as amputations and diseases has become popular in the 21st century, with stories like that of Sudarshan Gautam, a man with no arms who made it to the top in 2013 [344] A teenager with Down syndrome made it to Base camp, which has become a substitute for more extreme record-breaking because it carries many of the same thrills including the trip to the Himalayas and rustic scenery [345] Danger lurks even at base camp though, which was the site where dozens were killed in the 2015 Mount Everest avalanches Others that have climbed Everest with amputations include Mark Inglis (no legs), Hari Budha Magar (no legs), Paul Hockey (one arm only), and Arunima Sinha (one leg only).\n\n\nAviation\nLucy, Lady Houston, a British millionaire former showgirl, funded the Houston Everest Flight of 1933 A formation of airplanes led by the Marquess of Clydesdale flew over the summit in an effort to photograph the unknown terrain [346]\n\n\n1933: Flight over Everest\nLucy, Lady Houston, a British millionaire former showgirl, funded the Houston Everest Flight of 1933 A formation of airplanes led by the Marquess of Clydesdale flew over the summit in an effort to photograph the unknown terrain [346]\n\n\n1988: First climb and glide\nOn 26 September 1988, having climbed the mountain via the south-east ridge, Jean-Marc Boivin made the first paraglider descent of Everest, [318] in the process creating the record for the fastest descent of the mountain and the highest paraglider flight Boivin said: \"I was tired when I reached the top because I had broken much of the trail, and to run at this altitude was quite hard.\" [347] Boivin ran 18 m (60 ft) from below the summit on 40-degree slopes to launch his paraglider, reaching Camp II at 5,900 m (19,400 ft) in 12 minutes (some sources say 11 minutes) [347] [348] Boivin would not repeat this feat, as he was killed two years later in 1990, BASE jumping off Venezuela's Angel Falls [349]\n\n\n1991: Hot air balloon flyover\nIn 1991, four men in two balloons achieved the first hot-air balloon flight over Mount Everest [350] In one balloon were Andy Elson and Eric Jones (cameraman), and in the other balloon Chris Dewhirst and Leo Dickinson (cameraman) [351] Dickinson went on to write a book about the adventure called Ballooning Over Everest [351] The hot-air balloons were modified to function at up to 12,000 m (40,000 ft) altitude [351] Reinhold Messner called one of Dickinson's panoramic views of Everest, captured on the now discontinued Kodak Kodachrome film, the \"best snap on Earth\", according to UK newspaper The Telegraph [352] Dewhirst has offered to take passengers on a repeat of this feat for US$2.6 million per passenger [350]\n\n\n2005: Pilot summits with helicopter\nIn May 2005, pilot Didier Delsalle of France landed a Eurocopter AS350 B3 helicopter on the summit of Mount Everest [353] He needed to land for two minutes to set the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI) official record, but he stayed for about four minutes, twice [353] In this type of landing the rotors stay engaged, which avoids relying on the snow to fully support the aircraft The flight set rotorcraft world records, for highest of both landing and take-off [354]\n\n\n2011: Paraglide off summit\nOn 21 May 2011, Nepalis Lakpa Tsheri Sherpa and Sano Bapu Sunuwar paraglided from Everest's summit to Namche Bazaar in 42 minutes [284] [356] After the flight they hiked, biked, and kayaked to the Indian Ocean, reaching the Bay of Bengal by 27 June 2011, thereby becoming the first persons to complete a continuous summit-to-sea descent from Everest [357] They accomplished the ground-breaking feat despite Bapu having never previously climbed, and Lakpa having never kayaked and not even knowing how to swim [357] The duo subsequently won National Geographic Adventurers of the Year for 2012 for their exploits [357] In 2013 footage of the flight was shown on the television news program Nightline [358]\n\n\n2014: Helicopter-assisted ascent\nIn 2014, a team financed and led by mountaineer Wang Jing used a helicopter to fly from South base camp to Camp II to avoid the Khumbu Icefall, and thence climbed to the Everest summit [359] This climb immediately sparked outrage and controversy in much of the mountaineering world over the legitimacy and propriety of her climb [168] [360] Nepal ended up investigating Wang, who initially denied the claim that she had flown to Camp II, admitting only that some support crew were flown to that higher camp, over the Khumbu Icefall [361] In August 2014, however, she stated that she had flown to Camp II because the icefall was impassable \"If you don't fly to Camp II, you just go home\", she said in an interview In that same interview, she also insisted that she had never tried to hide this fact [168]\n\n\n2016: Helicopter business increases\nIn 2016 the increased use of helicopters was noted for increased efficiency and for hauling material over the deadly Khumbu icefall [362] In particular it was noted that flights saved icefall porters 80 trips but still increased commercial activity at Everest [362] After many Nepalis died in the icefall in 2014, the government had wanted helicopters to handle more transportation to Camp 1 but this was not possible because of the 2015 earthquake closing the mountain, so this was then implemented in 2016 (helicopters did prove instrumental in rescuing many people in 2015 though) [362] That summer Bell tested the 412EPI, which conducted a series of tests including hovering at 5,500 m (18,000 ft) and flying as high as 6,100 m (20,000 ft) altitude near Mount Everest [363]\n\n\nExtreme sports\nMount Everest has been host to other winter sports and adventuring besides mountaineering, including snowboarding, skiing, paragliding, and BASE jumping.\n\n\nReligious significance\nThe southern part of Mount Everest is regarded as one of several \"hidden valleys\" of refuge designated by Padmasambhava, a ninth-century \"lotus-born\" Buddhist saint [372]\n\n\nWaste management\nIn 2015, the president of the Nepal Mountaineering Association warned that pollution, especially human waste, has reached critical levels As much as 12,000 kg (26,500 lb) of human excrement each season is left behind on the mountain [374] Human waste is strewn across the verges of the route to the summit, making the four sleeping areas on the route up Everest's south side minefields of human excrement Climbers above Base Camp—for the 62-year history of climbing on the mountain—have most commonly either buried their excrement in holes they dug by hand in the snow, or slung it into crevasses, or simply defecated wherever convenient, often within metres of their tents The only place where climbers can defecate without worrying about contaminating the mountain is Base Camp At approximately 5,500 m (18,000 ft), Base Camp sees the most activity of all camps on Everest because climbers acclimate and rest there In the late-1990s, expeditions began using toilets that they fashioned from blue plastic 190-litre (50-US-gallon) barrels fitted with a toilet seat and enclosed [375]\n\n\nSee

Bush during 2003. He, Joe Piscopo, and Phil Hartman are the only cast members to have portrayed two sitting presidents. Jason Sudeikis portrayed two sitting presidents, but the portrayal of the second president was performed as a host, rather than a cast member. Dana Carvey also portrayed two sitting presidents, with the portrayal of the second president performed as a recurring guest.\n\n**Impersonation of Donald Trump**\n\nDonald Trump, having been a public figure before being president, was portrayed by several cast members over the years. He was portrayed by Phil Hartman (1988-1990), Darrell Hammond (1999-2011, 2015-2016), Jason Sudeikis (2012) and Taran Killam (2015). Alec Baldwin started impersonating Trump as a guest during the 42nd season of SNL in late 2016, when Trump was the Republican nominee during the 2016 United States presidential elections. Baldwin continued with the guest impersonations of Trump after the elections when Trump was president-elect, as well as after Trump was sworn in as president. Baldwin continued to impersonate Trump throughout Trump's first presidency.\n\n**Returning to Host**\n\nOver three dozen former SNL cast members have returned to host the show. The first former cast member to come back and host the show was Chevy Chase in February 1978. Chase is also the first former cast member to reach the Five-Timers Club, and is the most frequent-former cast member to host (although he got banned from hosting in 1997).\n\n**The \"SNL Curse\"**\n\nAlthough SNL is best known as the launchpad for many successful careers, eight former cast members have died before the age of 60.

Later that month, Friedman was removed from the project by TNT due to \"creative differences\" with the network [82] Graeme Manson was appointed to replace Friedman as showrunner the following month

Twitter:\n\n\nWriting\nThe series is designed to be a reboot of the original 2013 film's continuity The story takes place seven years after a climate catastrophe rendered the outside world uninhabitable, forcing the remnants of humanity to live confined inside of a massive train that constantly circles the globe The series investigates class struggle, as the passengers of the train are segregated by wealth [93] The series star Daveed Diggs said that the show would \"broaden exponentially\" the world established by the film and the 1982 graphic novel \"That's one of the advantages of TV, you have time\" Diggs said, \"so the politics that are hinted at in the film are explored in much more depth and the mechanism of the train  [is explored further] — just the little things that create a world, world specificity\" [94] At the 2017 Television Critics Association press tour, TNT and TBS president Kevin Reilly revealed that the Snowpiercer series would be akin to a \"space ship show\" due to its contained setting and that it would feature a mystery during the first season [95]\n\n\nCasting\nIn May 2017, Daveed Diggs was cast as Andre Layton [14] The following month, Jennifer Connelly and Mickey Sumner landed the other lead roles of Melanie Cavill and Bess Till, respectively [13] [15] Casting continued throughout the month of June with Annalise Basso as LJ Folger, Sasha Frolova as Pixi Aariak, Alison Wright as Ruth Wardell, Benjamin Haigh as Fergus McConnell, Roberto Urbina as Javi, and Katie McGuinness as Josie McConnell [23] [16] [20] That August, it was announced that Susan Park had joined the main cast as Jinju [19] In September, Lena Hall was cast as Sayori [17] The series order in January 2018 also revealed that Sheila Vand and Sam Otto had been cast in then-undisclosed roles as series regulars [80] Vand  was reported to be playing Zarah, while Otto will play John \"Oz\" Osweiler [22] [21] In August 2018, Iddo Goldberg and Jaylin Fletcher were added as series regulars in the roles of Bennett and Miles, respectively [18] [24]\n\n\nFilming\nIn January 2017, it was reported that filming for the series was scheduled to begin in mid-March of that year [100] By September 25, pilot director Scott Derrickson indicated that production for the series had officially commenced [101] [102] Reshoots for the pilot, overseen by new director James Hawes, began on August 20, 2018, in Vancouver, British Columbia and concluded on January 24, 2019 [85] [103] Principal photography for the second season began on October 21, 2019, in Langley, British Columbia and was originally expected to end on March 20, 2020 [104] In March 2020, production was shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic [105] Lena Hall, who portrays Miss Audrey, confirmed in July 2020 that the last block of episodes for season 2—episodes 9 and 10—were being filmed [106] As of March 11, 2021, filming for the third season was in progress until at least July 23, 2021 [107] [108] Filming for the fourth season began on March 28, 2022, and concluded on August 6, 2022 [109]\n\n\nDesign\nDespite the series' roots as a graphic novel and film, production designer Barry Robison was told to give the train \"its own identity\" He conceived the massive locomotive on a \"very, very long piece of paper\", drawing the entire train in \"about three days\" His Vancouver design team, headed by production designer Stephen Geaghan, then set out to construct around 20 of the 1,001 cars of various sizes over four soundstages, following TNT's orders to avoid making the train look \"too sci-fi\" Construction on each of the cars with contrasting classes took less than six weeks and was met with approval from series producer and film director Bong Joon-ho [110]\n\n\nRelease\nThe series debuted on TNT in the United States in the spring of 2020, [88] [91] while Netflix began to air the series globally outside of the United States and China [87] Huanxi Media Group is set to broadcast the first two seasons exclusively in China [89]\n\n\nBroadcast\nThe series debuted on TNT in the United States in the spring of 2020, [88] [91] while Netflix began to air the series globally outside of the

fans of Liverpool Football Club and the fans of Juventus in 1985 [19] The Football League First Division, the top level of English football since 1888, was behind leagues such as Italy's Serie A and Spain's La Liga in attendance and revenues, and several top English players had moved abroad [20]\n\n\nOrigins\nDespite significant European success in the 1970s and early 1980s, the late 1980s marked a low point for English football Stadiums were deteriorating, supporters endured poor facilities, hooliganism was rife, and English clubs had been banned from European competition for five years following the Heysel Stadium disaster between the fans of Liverpool Football Club and the fans of Juventus in 1985 [19] The Football League First Division, the top level of English football since 1888, was behind leagues such as Italy's Serie A and Spain's La Liga in attendance and revenues, and several top English players had moved abroad [20]\n\n\nFounding and Manchester United dominance (1990s)\nAt the close of the 1990–1991 season, a proposal was tabled for the establishment of a new league that would bring more money into the game overall The Founder Members Agreement, signed on 17 July 1991, by the game's top-flight clubs, established the basic principles for setting up the FA Premier League [35] The newly formed top division was to have commercial independence from the Football Association and the Football League, giving the FA Premier League licence to negotiate its own broadcast and sponsorship agreements The argument given at the time was that the extra income would allow English clubs to compete with teams across Europe [20] Although Dyke played a significant role in the creation of the Premier League, he and ITV (of which LWT was part) lost out in the bidding for broadcast rights: BSkyB won with a bid of £304 million over five years, with the BBC awarded the highlights package broadcast on Match of the Day [31] [33]\n\n\nEmergence of the \"Big Four\" (2000s)\nThe 2000s saw the rise of Liverpool alongside the \"Big 2\", followed by Chelsea finally breaking the Arsenal-Man United duopoly by winning the league in 2004–05 The dominance of the so-called \"Big Four\" clubs – Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, and Manchester United [39] [40] – saw them finish at the top of the table for most of the decade, thereby guaranteeing qualification for the UEFA Champions League Only three other clubs managed to qualify for the competition during this period: Newcastle United (2001–02 and 2002–03), Everton (2004–05), and Tottenham Hotspur (2009–10) – each occupying the final Champions League spot, with the exception of Newcastle in the 2002–03 season, who finished third.\n\n\nEmergence of the \"Big Six\" (2010s)\nThe years following 2009 marked a shift from the \"Big Four\" with Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester City breaking into the top four places on a regular basis, turning the \"Big Four\" into the \"Big Six\" [48] In the 2009–10 season, Tottenham finished fourth and became the first new team to finish in the top four since Everton five years prior [49] Criticism of the gap between an elite group of \"super clubs\" and the majority of the Premier League has continued, nevertheless, due to their increasing ability to spend more than the other Premier League clubs [50] Manchester City won the title in the 2011–12 season, becoming the first club outside the \"Big Four\" to win since Blackburn Rovers in the 1994–95 season That season also saw two of the \"Big Four\" (Chelsea and Liverpool) finish outside the top four places for the first time since that season [48]\n\n\nManchester City dominance (2020s)\nFrom the 2019–20 season, video assistant referees were used in the league [58] The 2019–20 season saw Liverpool win their first Premier League trophy, their first top-flight trophy in 30 years [59]\n\n\nCorporate structure\nThe Football Association Premier League Ltd (FAPL) [71] [72] [73] is operated as a corporation and is owned by the 20 member clubs Each club is a shareholder, with one vote each on issues such as rule changes and contracts The clubs select a chairman, chief executive, and board of directors to oversee the daily operations of the league [74] The Football Association is not directly involved in the day-to-day operations of the Premier League, but has veto power as a special shareholder during the election of the chairman and chief executive and when new rules are adopted by the league [75]\n\n\nCriticism of governance\nThe Premier League has faced criticism of its governance due to an alleged lack of transparency and accountability.\n\n\nCompetition format\n [The Premier League] is very tough and is different If you compare this league to another league, it's like playing another sport.\n\n\nCompetition\nThere are 20 clubs in the Premier League During the course of a season (from August to May) each club plays the others twice (a double round-robin system), once at their home stadium and once at that of their opponents, for 38 games Teams receive three points for a win and one point for a draw No points are awarded for a loss Teams are ranked by total points, then goal difference, and then goals scored If still equal, teams are deemed to occupy the same position If there is a tie for the championship, for relegation, or for qualification to other competitions, the head-to-head record between the tied teams is taken into consideration (points scored in the matches between the teams, followed by away goals in those matches.) If two teams are still tied, a play-off match at a neutral venue decides rank [88]\n\n\nPromotion and relegation\nA system of promotion and relegation exists between the Premier League and the EFL Championship The three lowest placed teams in the Premier League are relegated to the Championship, and the top two teams from the Championship promoted to the Premier League, [89] with an additional team promoted after a series of play-offs involving the third, fourth, fifth and sixth placed clubs [90] The number of clubs was reduced from 22 to 20 in 1995, when four teams were relegated from the league and only two teams promoted [91] [92] The top flight had only been expanded to 22 teams at the start of the 1991–92 season – the year prior to the formation of the Premier League [92]\n\n\nVideo Assistant Referee\nVideo assistant referee (VAR), was introduced to the Premier League at the beginning of the 2019–20 season It uses technology and officials to assist the referee in making decisions on the pitch [95] However, its use has been met with mixed receptions from fans and pundits, with some praising its accuracy whilst others criticise its impact on the flow of the game and consistency of decision-making.\n\n\nClubs\nFifty-one clubs have played in the Premier League from its inception in 1992, up to and including the 2023–24 season [97]\n\n\nChampions\nTitles won by club (%)\n\n\n2024–25 season\nTwenty clubs are competing in the 2024–25 season – top seventeen from the previous season and three promoted from the Championship.\n\n\nNon-English clubs\nIn 2011, after Swansea City gained promotion, a Welsh club participated in the Premier League for the first time [98] [99] The first Premier League match to be played outside England was Swansea City's home match at the Liberty Stadium against Wigan Athletic on 20 August 2011 [100] The number of Welsh clubs in the Premier League increased to two in 2013–14, as Cardiff City gained promotion, [101] but they were relegated after their maiden season [102] Cardiff were promoted again in 2017–18 but the number of Welsh clubs remained the same for the 2018–19 Premier League season, as Swansea City had been relegated from the Premier League in 2017–18 [103] Following Cardiff City's relegation after the 2018–19 season, there are currently no Welsh clubs participating in the Premier League

League and UEFA Europa League may earn an additional qualification for the subsequent season's Champions League league phase if did not finish in the top four If this means six Premier League teams qualify, then the fourth-placed team in the Premier League is instead entered in the Europa League, as any single nation is limited to a maximum of five teams in the Champions League However, starting

maximum of six teams from one association in the Champions League.\n\n\nPrevious seasons\nAn exception to the usual European qualification system happened in 2005, after Liverpool won the Champions League the season before, but did not finish in a Champions League qualification place in the Premier League UEFA gave special dispensation for Liverpool to enter the Champions League, giving England five qualifiers [115] The governing body subsequently ruled that the defending champions qualify for the competition the following year regardless of their domestic league placing However, for those leagues with four entrants in the Champions League, this meant that if the Champions League winners finished outside the top four in its domestic league, it would qualify at the expense of the fourth-placed team At that time, no association could have more than four entrants in the Champions League [116] This occurred in 2012, when Chelsea – who had won the Champions League that summer, but finished sixth in the league – qualified for the 2012–13 Champions League in place of Tottenham Hotspur, who went into the Europa League [117]\n\n\nPerformance in international competition\nWith 48 continental trophies won, English clubs are the third-most successful in European football, behind Italy (50) and Spain (67) In the top-tier UEFA Champions League, a record six English clubs have won a total of 15 titles and lost a further 11 finals, behind Spanish clubs with 20 and 11, respectively [120] In the second-tier UEFA Europa League, English clubs are third, with nine victories and eight losses in the finals [121] In the former second-tier UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, English teams won a record eight titles and had a further five finalists [122] In the non-UEFA organised Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, English clubs provided four winners and four runners-up, the second-most behind Spain with six and three, respectively [123] In the newly created third-tier UEFA Conference League, English clubs have won a joint-record one title so far [124] In the former fourth-tier UEFA Intertoto Cup, England won four titles and had a further final appearance, placing it fifth in the rankings, although English clubs were notorious for treating the tournament with disdain, either sending \"B\" squads or withdrawing from it altogether [125] [126] [127] In the one-off UEFA Super Cup, England has ten winners and ten runners-up, the second-most behind Spain with 17 and 15, respectively [128] Similarly to the Intertoto Cup, English teams did not take the former Intercontinental Cup seriously enough, despite its international status of the Club World Championship They a made a total of six appearances in the one-off competition, winning only one of them, and withdrew a further three times [129] English clubs have won the FIFA-organised Club World Cup four times, tied for the second-most with Brazil, and behind only Spain, with eight [130] [127]\n\n\nSponsorship\nAfter an inaugural season with no sponsorship, the Premier League was sponsored by Carling from 1993 until 2001, during which time it was known as the FA Carling Premiership In 2001, a new sponsorship deal with Barclaycard saw the league rebranded the FA Barclaycard Premiership, which was changed to the FA Barclays Premiership in time for the 2004–05 season.\n\n\nFinances\nThe Premier League has the highest revenue of any association football league in the world, with total club revenues of €2.48 billion in 2009–10 [143] [144] In 2013–14, due to improved television revenues and cost controls, the Premier League clubs collectively made a net profit in excess of £78 million, exceeding all other football leagues [145] In 2010 the Premier League was awarded the Queen's Award for Enterprise in the International Trade category for its outstanding contribution to international trade and the value it brings to English football and the United Kingdom's broadcasting industry [146]\n\n\nRelegation\nSince its split with the Football League, established clubs in the Premier League have a funding disparity from counterparts in lower leagues Revenue from television rights between the leagues has played a part in this [150]\n\n\nMedia coverage\nTelevision has played a major role in the history of the Premier League The League's decision to assign broadcasting rights to Sky in 1992 was at the time a radical decision, but one that has paid off At the time, paid television was an almost untested proposition in the UK market as was charging fans to watch live televised football However, a combination of Sky's strategy, the quality of Premier League football and the public's appetite for the game has seen the value of the Premier League's TV rights soar [25]\n\n\nUnited Kingdom and Ireland\nTelevision

football and the public's appetite for the game has seen the value of the Premier League's TV rights soar [25]\n\n\nWorldwide\nThe Premier League is the most-watched football league in the world, broadcast in 212 territories to 643 million homes and a potential TV audience of 4.7 billion people [9] The Premier League's production arm, Premier League Productions, is operated by IMG Productions and produces content for its international television partners [195]\n\n\nStadiums\nAs of the 2023–24 season, Premier League football has been played in 61 stadiums since the formation of the division [228] The Hillsborough disaster in 1989 and the subsequent Taylor Report saw a recommendation that standing terraces should be abolished As a result, all stadiums in the Premier League are all-seater [229] [230] Since the formation of the Premier League, football grounds in England have seen constant improvements to capacity and facilities, with some clubs moving to new-build stadiums [231] Eleven stadiums that have seen Premier League football have now been demolished The stadiums for the 2023–24 season show a large disparity in capacity For example, Old Trafford, the home of Manchester United, has a capacity of 74,031 whilst Dean Court, the home of Bournemouth, has a capacity of 11,307 The combined total capacity of the Premier League in the 2023–24 season is 787,002 with an average capacity of 39,350.\n\n\nManagers\nI have never known this level before Of course, there are managers in Germany, Italy, and Spain, but in the Premier League, these are the best managers, the elite managers The quality, the preparation The level is so high.\n\n\nPlayers\nPlayer transfers may only take place within transfer windows set by the Football Association The two transfer windows run from the last day of the season to 31 August and from 31 December to 31 January Player registrations cannot be exchanged outside these windows except under specific licence from the FA, usually on an emergency basis [246] As of the 2010–11 season, the Premier League introduced new rules mandating that each club must register a maximum 25-man squad of players aged over 21, with the squad list only allowed to be changed in transfer windows or in exceptional circumstances [247] [248] This was to enable the \"home grown\" rule to be enacted, whereby the Premier League would also from 2010 require at least eight members of the named 25-man squad to be \"home-grown players\" [247]\n\n\nAppearances\nPlayer transfers may only take place within transfer windows set by the Football Association The

the increasingly lucrative television deals, player wages rose sharply following the formation of the Premier League, when the average player wage was £75,000 per year [264] In the 2018–19 season the average annual salary stood at £2.99 million.\n\n\nPlayer transfer fees\nThe record transfer fee for a Premier League player has risen steadily over the lifetime of the competition Before the start of the first Premier League season, Alan Shearer became the first British player to command a transfer fee of more than £3 million [266] The record has increased steadily and Enzo Fernández is now the most expensive transfer fee paid by a Premier League club at £106.8 million, whilst Philippe Coutinho is the biggest transfer involving a Premier League club at £105 million.\n\n\nAwards\nThe Premier League maintains two trophies – the genuine trophy (held by the reigning champions) and a spare replica Two trophies are held for the purpose of making the award within minutes of the title being

"en", "article": "**Premier League**\n\nThe Premier League, also known as the English Premier League (EPL), is the top division of the English football league system. It is a professional association football league in England, consisting of 20 clubs. The league was established in 1992 as a result of a breakaway from the Football League First Division.\n\n**History**\n\nDespite significant European success in the 1970s and early 1980s, the late 1980s marked a low point for English football. Stadiums were deteriorating, supporters endured poor facilities, hooliganism was rife, and English clubs had been banned from European competition for five years following the Heysel Stadium disaster between the fans of Liverpool Football Club and the fans of Juventus in 1985. The Football League First Division, the top level of English football since 1888, was behind leagues such as Italy's Serie A and Spain's La Liga in attendance and revenues, and several top English players had moved abroad.\n\n**Origins**\n\nThe late 1980s marked a low point for English football. Stadiums were deteriorating, supporters endured poor facilities, hooliganism was rife, and English clubs had been banned from European competition for five years following the Heysel Stadium disaster between the fans of Liverpool Football Club and the fans of Juventus in 1985. The Football League First Division, the top level of English football since 1888, was behind leagues such as Italy's Serie A and Spain's La Liga in attendance and revenues, and several top English players had moved abroad.\n\n**Founding and Manchester United dominance (1990s)**\n\nAt the close of the 1990–1991 season, a proposal was tabled for the establishment of a new league that would bring more money into the game overall. The Founder Members Agreement, signed on 17 July 1991, by the game's top-flight clubs, established the basic principles for setting up the FA Premier League. The newly formed top division was to have commercial independence from the Football Association and the Football League, giving the FA Premier League licence to negotiate its own broadcast and sponsorship agreements. Although Dyke played a significant role in the creation of the Premier League, he and ITV (of which LWT was part) lost out in the bidding for broadcast rights: BSkyB won with a bid of £304 million over five years, with the BBC awarded the highlights package broadcast on Match of the Day.\n\n**Emergence of the \"Big Four\" (2000s)**\n\nThe 2000s saw the rise of Liverpool alongside the \"Big 2\", followed by Chelsea finally breaking the Arsenal-Man United duopoly by winning the league in 2004–05. The dominance of the so-called \"Big Four\" clubs – Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, and Manchester United – saw them finish at the top of the table for most of the decade, thereby guaranteeing qualification for the UEFA Champions League. Only three other clubs managed to qualify for the competition during this period: Newcastle United (2001–02 and 2002–03), Everton (2004–05), and Tottenham Hotspur (2009–10) – each occupying the final Champions League spot, with the exception of Newcastle in the 2002–03 season, who finished third.\n\n**Emergence of the \"Big Six\" (2010s)**\n\nThe years following 2009 marked a shift from the \"Big Four\" with Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester City breaking into the top four places on a regular basis, turning the \"Big Four\" into the \"Big Six\". In the 2009–10 season, Tottenham finished fourth and became the first new team to finish in the top four since Everton five years prior. Criticism of the gap between an elite group of \"super clubs\" and the majority of the Premier League has continued, nevertheless, due to their increasing ability to spend more than the other Premier League clubs. Manchester City won the title in the 2011–12 season, becoming the first club outside the \"Big Four\" to win since Blackburn Rovers in the 1994–95 season. That season also saw two of the \"Big Four\" (Chelsea and Liverpool) finish outside the top four places for the first time since that season.\n\n**Manchester City dominance (2020s)**\n\nFrom the 2019–20 season, video assistant referees were used in the league. The 2019–20 season saw Liverpool win their first Premier League trophy, their first top-flight trophy in 30 years.\n\n**Corporate structure**\n\nThe Football Association Premier League Ltd (FAPL) is operated as a corporation and is owned by the 20 member clubs. Each club is a shareholder, with one vote each on issues such as rule changes and contracts. The clubs select a chairman, chief executive, and board of directors to oversee the daily operations of the league. The Football Association is not directly involved in the day-to-day operations of the Premier League, but has veto power as a special shareholder during the election of the chairman and chief executive and when new rules are adopted by the league.\n\n**Criticism of governance**\n\nThe Premier League has faced criticism of its governance due to an alleged lack of transparency and accountability.\n\n**Competition format**\n\nThere are 20 clubs in the Premier League. During the course of a season (from August to May) each club plays the others twice (a double round-robin system), once at their home stadium and once at that of their opponents, for 38 games. Teams receive three points for a win and one point for a draw. No points are awarded for a loss. Teams are ranked by total points, then goal difference, and then goals scored. If still equal, teams are deemed to occupy the same position. If there is a tie for the championship, for relegation, or for qualification to other competitions, the head-to-head record between the tied teams is taken into consideration (points scored in the matches between the teams, followed by away goals in those matches). If two teams are still tied, a play-off match at a neutral venue decides rank.\n\n**Promotion and relegation**\n\nA system of promotion and relegation exists between the Premier League and the EFL Championship. The three lowest placed teams in the Premier League are relegated to the Championship, and the top two teams from the Championship promoted to the Premier League.\n\n**Video Assistant Referee**\n\nVideo assistant referee (VAR) was introduced to the Premier League at the beginning of the 2019–20 season. It uses technology and officials to assist the referee in making decisions on the pitch. However, its use has been met with mixed receptions from fans and pundits, with some praising its accuracy whilst others criticise its impact on the flow of the game and consistency of decision-making.\n\n**Clubs**\n\nFifty-one clubs have played in the Premier League from its inception in 1992, up to and including the 2023–24 season.\n\n**Champions**\n\nTitles won by club (%)\n\n* Manchester United: 20\n* Chelsea: 6\n* Arsenal: 3\n* Manchester City: 4\n* Liverpool: 2\n\n**Non-English clubs**\n\nIn 2011, after Swansea City gained promotion, a Welsh club participated in the Premier League for the first time. The first Premier League match to be played outside England was Swansea City's home match at the Liberty Stadium against Wigan Athletic on 20 August 2011. The number of Welsh clubs in the Premier League increased to two in 2013–14, as Cardiff City gained promotion, but they were relegated after their maiden season.\n\n**International competitions**\n\nThe top four teams in the Premier League qualify automatically for the subsequent season's UEFA Champions League league phase. The champions of the Champions League and UEFA Europa League may earn an additional qualification for the subsequent season's Champions League league phase if did not finish in the top four. If this means six Premier League teams qualify, then the fourth-placed team in the Premier League is instead entered in the Europa League, as any single nation is limited to a maximum of five teams in the Champions League.\n\n**Qualification criteria for 2024–25**\n\nThe top four teams in the Premier League qualify automatically for the subsequent season's UEFA Champions League league phase. The champions of the Champions League and UEFA Europa League may earn an additional qualification for the subsequent season's Champions League league phase if did not finish in the top four.\n\n**Previous seasons**\n\nAn exception to the usual European qualification system happened in 2005, after Liverpool won the Champions League the season before, but did not finish in a Champions League qualification place in the Premier League. UEFA gave special dispensation for Liverpool to enter the Champions League, giving England five qualifiers. The governing body subsequently ruled that the defending champions qualify for the competition the following year regardless of their domestic league placing.\n\n**Performance in international competition**\n\nWith 48 continental trophies won, English clubs are the third-most successful in European football, behind Italy (50) and Spain (67). In the top-tier UEFA Champions League, a record six English clubs have won a total of 15 titles and lost a further 11 finals, behind Spanish clubs with 20 and 11, respectively. In the second-tier UEFA Europa League, English clubs are third, with nine victories and eight losses in the finals. In the former second-tier UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, English teams won a record eight titles and had a further five finalists. In the non-UEFA organised Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, English clubs provided four winners and four runners-up, the second-most behind Spain with six and three, respectively. In the newly created third-tier UEFA Conference League, English clubs have won a joint-record one title so far. In the former fourth-tier UEFA Intertoto Cup, England won four titles and had a further final appearance, placing it fifth in the rankings. In the one-off UEFA Super Cup, England has ten winners and ten runners-up, the second-most behind Spain with 17 and 15, respectively. Similarly to the Intertoto Cup, English teams did not take the former Intercontinental Cup seriously enough, despite its international status of the Club World Championship. They made a total of six appearances in the one-off competition, winning only one of them, and withdrew a further three times.\n\n**Sponsorship**\n\nAfter an inaugural season with no sponsorship, the Premier League was sponsored by Carling from 1993 until 2001, during which time it was known as the FA Carling Premiership. In 2001, a new sponsorship deal with Barclaycard saw the league rebranded the FA Barclaycard Premiership, which was changed to the FA Barclays Premiership in time for the 2004–05 season.\n\n**Finances**\n\nThe Premier League has the highest revenue of any association football league in the world, with total club revenues of €2.48 billion in 2009–10. In 2013–14, due to improved television revenues and cost controls, the Premier League clubs collectively made a net profit in excess of £78 million, exceeding all other football leagues.\n\n**Relegation**\n\nSince its split with the Football League, established clubs in the Premier League have a funding disparity from counterparts in lower leagues.

However, a combination of Sky's strategy, the quality of Premier League football and the public's appetite for the game has seen the value of the Premier League's TV rights soar.\n\n**Worldwide**\n\nThe Premier League is the most-watched football league in the world, broadcast in 212 territories to 643 million homes and a potential TV audience of 4.7 billion people.\n\n**Stadiums**\n\nAs of the 2023–24 season, Premier League football has been played in 61 stadiums since the formation of the division. The Hillsborough disaster in 1989 and the subsequent Taylor Report saw a recommendation that standing terraces should be abolished. As a result, all stadiums in the Premier League are all-seater. Since the formation of the Premier League, football grounds in England have seen constant improvements to capacity and facilities, with some clubs moving to new-build stadiums. Eleven stadiums that have seen Premier League football have now been demolished. The stadiums for the 2023–24 season show a large disparity in capacity.

with teams across Europe [20] Although Dyke played a significant role in the creation of the Premier League, he and ITV (of which LWT was part) lost out in the bidding for broadcast rights: BSkyB won with a bid of £304 million over five years, with the BBC awarded the highlights package broadcast on Match of the Day [31] [33]\n\n\nEmergence of the \"Big Four\" (2000s)\nThe 2000s saw the rise of Liverpool alongside the \"Big 2\", followed by Chelsea finally breaking the Arsenal-Man United duopoly by winning the league in 2004–05 The dominance of the so-called \"Big Four\" clubs – Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, and Manchester United [39] [40] – saw them finish at the top of the table for most of the decade, thereby guaranteeing qualification for the UEFA Champions League Only three other clubs managed to qualify for the competition during this period: Newcastle United (2001–02 and 2002–03), Everton (2004–05), and Tottenham Hotspur (2009–10) – each occupying the final Champions League spot, with the exception of Newcastle in the 2002–03 season, who finished third.\n\n\nEmergence of the \"Big Six\" (2010s)\nThe years following 2009 marked a shift from the \"Big Four\" with Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester City breaking into the top four places on a regular basis, turning the \"Big Four\" into the \"Big Six\" [48] In the 2009–10 season, Tottenham finished fourth and became the first new team to finish in the top four since Everton five years prior [49] Criticism of the gap between an elite group of \"super clubs\" and the majority of the Premier League has continued, nevertheless, due to their increasing ability to spend more than the other Premier League clubs [50] Manchester City won the title in the 2011–12 season, becoming the first club outside the \"Big Four\" to win since Blackburn Rovers in the 1994–95 season That season also saw two of the \"Big Four\" (Chelsea and Liverpool) finish outside the top four places for the first time since that season [48]\n\n\nManchester City dominance (2020s)\nFrom the 2019–20 season, video assistant referees were used in the league [58] The 2019–20 season saw Liverpool win their first Premier League trophy, their first top-flight trophy in 30 years [59]\n\n\nCorporate structure\nThe Football Association Premier League Ltd (FAPL) [71] [72] [73] is operated as a corporation and is owned by the 20 member clubs Each club is a shareholder, with one vote each on issues such as rule changes and contracts The clubs select a chairman, chief executive, and board of directors to oversee the daily operations of the league [74] The Football Association is not directly involved in the day-to-day operations of the Premier League, but has veto power as a special shareholder during the election of the chairman and chief executive and when new rules are adopted by the league [75]\n\n\nCriticism of governance\nThe Premier League has faced criticism of its governance due to an alleged lack of transparency and accountability.\n\n\nCompetition format\n [The Premier League] is very tough and is different If you compare this league to another league, it's like playing another sport.\n\n\nCompetition\nThere are 20 clubs in the Premier League During the course of a season (from August to May) each club plays the others twice (a double round-robin system), once at their home stadium and once at that of their opponents, for 38 games Teams receive three points for a win and one point for a draw No points are awarded for a loss Teams are ranked by total points, then goal difference, and then goals scored If still equal, teams are deemed to occupy the same position If there is a tie for the championship, for relegation, or for qualification to other competitions, the head-to-head record between the tied teams is taken into consideration (points scored in the matches between the teams, followed by away goals in those matches.) If two teams are still tied, a play-off match at a neutral venue decides rank [88]\n\n\nPromotion and relegation\nA system of promotion and relegation exists between the Premier League and the EFL Championship The three lowest placed teams in the Premier League are relegated to the Championship, and the top two teams from the Championship promoted to the Premier League, [89] with an additional team promoted after a series of play-offs involving the third, fourth, fifth and sixth placed clubs [90] The number of clubs was reduced from 22 to 20 in 1995, when four teams were relegated from the league and only two teams promoted [91] [92] The top flight had only been expanded to 22 teams at the start of the 1991–92 season – the year prior to the formation of the Premier League [92]\n\n\nVideo Assistant Referee\nVideo assistant referee (VAR), was introduced to the Premier League at the beginning of the 2019–20 season It uses technology and officials to assist the referee in making decisions on the pitch [95] However, its use has been met with mixed receptions from fans and pundits, with some praising its accuracy whilst others criticise its impact on the flow of the game and consistency of decision-making.\n\n\nClubs\nFifty-one clubs have played in the Premier League from its inception in 1992, up to and including the 2023–24 season [97]\n\n\nChampions\nTitles won by club (%)\n\n\n2024–25 season\nTwenty clubs are competing in the 2024–25 season – top seventeen from the previous season and three promoted from the Championship.\n\n\nNon-English clubs\nIn 2011, after Swansea City gained promotion, a Welsh club participated in the Premier League for the first time [98] [99] The first Premier League match to be played outside England was Swansea City's home match at the Liberty Stadium against Wigan Athletic on 20 August 2011 [100] The number of Welsh clubs in the Premier League increased to two in 2013–14, as Cardiff City gained promotion, [101] but they were relegated after their maiden season [102] Cardiff were promoted again in 2017–18 but the number of Welsh clubs remained the same for the 2018–19 Premier League season, as Swansea City had been relegated from the Premier League in 2017–18 [103] Following Cardiff City's relegation after the 2018–19 season, there are currently no Welsh clubs participating in the Premier League [104]\n\n\nInternational competitions\nThe top four teams in the Premier League qualify automatically for the subsequent season's UEFA Champions League league phase The champions of the Champions League and UEFA Europa League may earn an additional qualification for the subsequent season's Champions League league phase if did not finish in the top four If this means six Premier League teams qualify, then the fourth-placed team in the Premier League is instead entered in the Europa League, as any single nation is limited to a maximum of five teams in the Champions League However, starting from the 2024–25 UEFA Champions League there are additional berths for the two best associations in the previous season's ranking, which may result in a maximum of six teams from one association in the Champions League.\n\n\nQualification for European competitions\nThe top four teams in the Premier League qualify automatically for the subsequent season's UEFA Champions League league phase The champions of the Champions League and UEFA Europa League may earn an additional qualification for the subsequent season's Champions League league phase if did not finish in the top four If this means six Premier League teams qualify, then the fourth-placed team in the Premier League is instead entered in the Europa League, as any single nation is limited to a maximum of five teams in the Champions League However, starting from the 2024–25 UEFA Champions League there are additional berths for the two best associations in the previous season's ranking, which may result in a maximum of six teams from one association in the Champions League.\n\n\nQualification criteria for 2024–25\nThe top four teams in the Premier League qualify automatically for the subsequent season's UEFA Champions League league phase The champions of the Champions League and UEFA Europa League may earn an additional qualification for the subsequent season's Champions League league phase if did not finish in the top four If this means six Premier League teams qualify, then the fourth-placed team in the Premier League is instead entered in the Europa League, as any single nation is limited to a maximum of five teams in the Champions League However, starting from the 2024–25 UEFA Champions League there are additional berths for the two best associations in the previous season's ranking, which may result in a maximum of six teams from one association in the Champions League.\n\n\nPrevious seasons\nAn exception to the usual European qualification system happened in 2005, after Liverpool won the Champions League the season before, but did not finish in a Champions League qualification place in the Premier League UEFA gave special dispensation for Liverpool to enter the Champions League, giving England five qualifiers [115] The governing body subsequently ruled that the defending champions qualify for the competition the following year regardless of their domestic league placing However, for those leagues with four entrants in the Champions League, this meant that if the Champions League winners finished outside the top four in its domestic league, it would qualify at the expense of the fourth-placed team At that time, no association could have more than four entrants in the Champions League [116] This occurred in 2012, when Chelsea – who had won the Champions League that summer, but finished sixth in the league – qualified for the 2012–13 Champions League in place of Tottenham Hotspur, who went into the Europa League [117]\n\n\nPerformance in international competition\nWith 48 continental trophies won, English clubs are the third-most successful in European football, behind Italy (50) and Spain (67) In the top-tier UEFA Champions League, a record six English clubs have won a total of 15 titles and lost a further 11 finals, behind Spanish clubs with 20 and 11, respectively [120] In the second-tier UEFA Europa League, English clubs are third, with nine victories and eight losses in the finals [121] In the former second-tier UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, English teams won a record eight titles and had a further five finalists [122] In the non-UEFA organised Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, English clubs provided four winners and four runners-up, the second-most behind Spain with six and three, respectively [123] In the newly created third-tier UEFA Conference League, English clubs have won a joint-record one title so far [124] In the former fourth-tier UEFA Intertoto Cup, England won four titles and had a further final appearance, placing it fifth in the rankings, although English clubs were notorious for treating the tournament with disdain, either sending \"B\" squads or withdrawing from it altogether [125] [126] [127] In the one-off UEFA Super Cup, England has ten winners and ten runners-up, the second-most behind Spain with 17 and 15, respectively [128] Similarly to the Intertoto Cup, English teams did not take the former Intercontinental Cup seriously enough, despite its international status of the Club World Championship They a made a total of six appearances in the one-off competition, winning only one of them, and withdrew a further three times [129] English clubs have won the FIFA-organised Club World Cup four times, tied for the second-most with Brazil, and behind only Spain, with eight [130] [127]\n\n\nSponsorship\nAfter an inaugural season with no sponsorship, the Premier League was sponsored by Carling from 1993 until 2001, during which time it was known as the FA Carling Premiership In 2001, a new sponsorship deal with Barclaycard saw the league rebranded the FA Barclaycard Premiership, which was changed to the FA Barclays Premiership in time for the 2004–05 season.\n\n\nFinances\nThe Premier League has the highest revenue of any association football league in the world, with total club revenues of €2.48 billion in 2009–10 [143] [144] In 2013–14, due to improved television revenues and cost controls, the Premier League clubs collectively made a net profit in excess of £78 million, exceeding all other football leagues [145] In 2010 the Premier League was awarded the Queen's Award for Enterprise in the International Trade category for its outstanding contribution to international trade and the value it brings to English football and the United Kingdom's broadcasting industry [146]\n\n\nRelegation\nSince its split with the Football League, established clubs in the Premier League have a funding disparity from counterparts in lower leagues Revenue from television rights between the leagues has played a part in this [150]\n\n\nMedia coverage\nTelevision has played a major role in the history of the Premier League The League's decision to assign broadcasting rights to Sky in 1992 was at the time a radical decision, but one that has paid off At the time, paid television was an almost untested proposition in the UK market as was charging fans to watch live televised football However, a combination of Sky's strategy, the quality of Premier League football and the public's appetite for the game has seen the value of the Premier League's TV rights soar [25]\n\n\nUnited Kingdom and Ireland\nTelevision has played a major role in the history of the Premier League The League's decision to assign broadcasting rights to Sky in 1992 was at the time a radical decision, but one that has paid off At the time, paid television was an almost untested proposition in the UK market as was charging fans to watch live televised football However, a combination of Sky's strategy, the quality of Premier League football and the public's appetite for the game has seen the value of the Premier League's TV rights soar [25]\n\n\nWorldwide\nThe Premier League is the most-watched football league in the world, broadcast in 212 territories to 643 million homes and a potential TV audience of 4.7 billion people [9] The Premier League's production arm, Premier League Productions, is operated by IMG Productions and produces content for its international television partners [195]\n\n\nStadiums\nAs of the 2023–24 season, Premier League football has been played in 61 stadiums since the formation of the division [228] The Hillsborough disaster in 1989 and the subsequent Taylor Report saw a recommendation that standing terraces should be abolished As a result, all stadiums in the Premier League are all-seater [229] [230] Since the formation of the Premier League, football grounds in England have seen constant improvements to capacity and facilities, with some clubs moving to new-build stadiums [231] Eleven stadiums that have seen Premier League football have now been demolished The stadiums for the 2023–24 season show a large disparity in capacity For example, Old Trafford, the home of Manchester United, has a capacity of 74,031 whilst Dean Court, the home of Bournemouth, has a capacity of 11,307 The combined total capacity of the Premier League in the 2023–24 season is 787,002 with an average capacity of 39,350.\n\n\nManagers\nI have never known this level before Of course, there are managers in Germany, Italy, and Spain, but in the Premier League, these are the best managers, the elite managers The quality, the preparation The level is so high.\n\n\nPlayers\nPlayer transfers may only take place within transfer windows set by the Football Association The two transfer windows run from the last day of the season to 31 August and from 31 December to 31 January Player registrations cannot be exchanged outside these windows except under specific licence from the FA, usually on an emergency basis [246] As of the 2010–11 season, the Premier League introduced new rules mandating that each club must register a maximum 25-man squad of players aged over 21, with the squad list only allowed to be changed in transfer windows or in exceptional circumstances [247] [248] This was to enable the \"home grown\" rule to be enacted, whereby the Premier League would also from 2010 require at least eight members of the named 25-man squad to be \"home-grown players\" [247]\n\n\nAppearances\nPlayer transfers may only take place within transfer windows set by the Football Association The two transfer windows run from the last day of the season to 31 August and from 31 December to 31 January Player registrations cannot be exchanged outside these windows except under specific licence from the FA, usually on an emergency basis [246] As of the 2010–11 season, the Premier League introduced new rules mandating that each club must register a maximum 25-man squad of players aged over

would also from 2010 require at least eight members of the named 25-man squad to be \"home-grown players\" [247]\n\n\nTransfer regulations and foreign players\nPlayer transfers may only take place within transfer windows set by the Football Association The two transfer windows run from the last day of the season to 31 August and from 31 December to 31 January Player registrations cannot be exchanged outside these windows except under specific licence from the FA, usually on an emergency basis [246] As of the 2010–11 season, the Premier League introduced new rules mandating that each

\"home grown\" rule to be enacted, whereby the Premier League would also from 2010 require at least eight members of the named 25-man squad to be \"home-grown players\" [247]\n\n\nTop scorers\nItalics denotes players still playing professional football,Bold denotes players still playing in the Premier League.\n\n\nWages\nThere is no team or individual salary cap in the Premier League As a result of the increasingly lucrative television deals, player wages rose sharply following the formation of the Premier League, when the average player wage was £75,000 per year [264] In the 2018–19 season the average annual salary stood at £2.99 million.\n\n\nPlayer transfer fees\nThe record transfer fee for a Premier League player has risen steadily over the lifetime of the competition Before the start of the first Premier League season, Alan Shearer became the first British player to command a transfer fee of more than £3 million [266] The record has increased steadily and Enzo Fernández is now the most expensive transfer fee paid by a Premier League club at £106.8 million, whilst Philippe Coutinho is the biggest transfer involving a Premier League club at £105 million.\n\n\nAwards\nThe Premier League maintains two trophies – the genuine trophy (held by the reigning champions) and a spare replica Two trophies are held for the purpose of making the award within minutes of the title being secured, in the event that on the final day of the season two clubs are still within reach of winning the League [293] In the rare event that more than two clubs are vying for the title on the final day of the season, a replica won by a previous club is used [294]\n\n\nTrophy\nThe Premier League maintains two trophies – the genuine trophy (held by the reigning champions) and a spare replica Two

the winner's trophy and the individual winner's medals awarded to players who win the title, the Premier League also issues other awards throughout the season.\n\n\n20 Seasons Awards\nIn 2012, the Premier League celebrated its second decade by holding the 20 Seasons Awards: [309]\n\n\nSee also\nBibliography\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n\nReferences\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal

She is best known for her critically acclaimed performances in films such as \"Conrack\" and the television mini-series \"Roots\". Sinclair's career spanned over three decades, during which she earned numerous awards and nominations for her performances.\n\n## Early Life and Education\n\nMadge Sinclair was born Madge Dorita Walters in Kingston, Jamaica, to Jamaican parents Herbert and Jemima Walters. She grew up in a family of modest means and was educated at Shortwood College for Women, a prestigious institution in Jamaica. After completing her studies, Sinclair worked as a teacher in Jamaica until 1966, when she left for New York to pursue her career in acting.\n\n## Career\n\nSinclair began her acting career with Joseph Papp's Public Theatre in New York City. Her early performances were met with critical acclaim, and she quickly established herself as a talented and versatile actress. In 1971, she portrayed Clytemnestra in the New York Shakespearean Festival production of \"The Wedding of Iphigenia\", a role that showcased her ability to tackle complex and nuanced characters.\n\nSinclair's breakthrough performance came in 1974, when she played the role of Mrs. Scott in the film \"Conrack\", opposite Jon Voight. Her portrayal of the character earned her a nomination for the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actress in a Motion Picture. This performance marked a significant milestone in Sinclair's career, as it demonstrated her ability to excel in a leading role in a major film.\n\nIn 1977, Sinclair appeared in the ABC mini-series \"Roots\", a historical epic that told the story of the transatlantic slave trade. Her performance as Bell Reynolds was widely praised, and she received her first nomination for a Primetime Emmy Award. This performance cemented Sinclair's reputation as a talented and dedicated actress, and she went on to appear in numerous other television productions throughout her career.\n\n## Personal Life\n\nSinclair was married twice during her lifetime. Her first marriage was to Royston Sinclair, a Jamaican police officer, in 1956. The couple had two sons, and they were married until 1969. After her divorce from Royston, Sinclair married actor Dean Compton in 1982. The couple remained together until her death in 1995.\n\n## Death\n\nSinclair died on December 20, 1995, following a 13-year battle with leukemia. Her remains were cremated, and her ashes were scattered in her hometown in Jamaica.

the zodiac hand signs originate from this [6] When Kishimoto was creating the primary setting of the Naruto manga, he concentrated initially on the designs for the village of Konoha The idea of the setting came to him \"pretty spontaneously without much thought\", but admits that the scenery became based on his home in the Japanese prefecture of Okayama Since the storyline does not specify when it is set, he was able to include modern elements in the series such as convenience stores [15] He considered including automobiles, planes and simple computers, but excluded projectile weapons and vehicles from the plot [15] [16]\n\n\nConclusion\nMasashi Kishimoto's home was close to Hiroshima where his grandfather lived He would often tell his grandson stories of war and how it was related to grudges However, Kishimoto commented that someone cannot look at the current state and criticize war as \"being simply wrong\", adding that every little thing in history causes the build-up towards war, and when it reaches its limit, \"it breaks out.\" For that reason, Kishimoto felt that war would not be believable in his manga unless he had carefully elaborated on its background Upon further researching, Kishimoto decided to create a world war story arc for the manga's finale However, unlike the stories he heard from his grandfather, Kishimoto wanted to give the war covered in Naruto a more hopeful feeling [17] Nagato's arc paved the way for the ending of Naruto to occur Nagato stood out as a villain due to suffering war and killing Naruto's mentor Jiraiya Understanding the fears of war, Naruto's characterization was made more complex for him to experience the Fourth Great Shinobi War These events end with Naruto forgiving Sasuke as he had forgiven Nagato in the final battle [14]\n\n\nMedia\nWritten and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto, Naruto was serialized for a 15-year run in Shueisha's magazine, Weekly Shōnen Jump from September 21, 1999, [25] [26] to November 10, 2014 [27] [28] Shueisha collected its chapters in 72 tankōbon volumes—27 for Part I, and the rest for Part II;

Sasuke discovers late in the series that he has the ability to \"blow away\" the influence of the Nine-Tailed Fox on Naruto Foxes (kitsune tsuki) are tricksters in Japanese mythology, and in some stories, they take over human bodies;

the zodiac hand signs originate from this [6] When Kishimoto was creating the primary setting of the Naruto manga, he concentrated initially on the designs for the village of Konoha The idea of the setting came to him \"pretty spontaneously without much thought\", but admits that the scenery became based on his home in the Japanese prefecture of Okayama Since the storyline does not specify when it is set, he was able to include modern elements in the series such as convenience stores [15] He considered including automobiles, planes and simple computers, but excluded projectile weapons and vehicles from the plot [15] [16]\n\n\nConclusion\nMasashi Kishimoto's home was close to Hiroshima where his grandfather lived He would often tell his grandson stories of war and how it was related to grudges However, Kishimoto commented that someone cannot look at the current state and criticize war as \"being simply wrong\", adding that every little thing in history causes the build-up towards war, and when it reaches its limit, \"it breaks out.\" For that reason, Kishimoto felt that war would not be believable in his manga unless he had carefully elaborated on its background Upon further researching, Kishimoto decided to create a world war story arc for the manga's finale However, unlike the stories he heard from his grandfather, Kishimoto wanted to give the war covered in Naruto a more hopeful feeling [17] Nagato's arc paved the way for the ending of Naruto to occur Nagato stood out as a villain due to suffering war and killing Naruto's mentor Jiraiya Understanding the fears of war, Naruto's characterization was made more complex for him to experience the Fourth Great Shinobi War These events end with Naruto forgiving Sasuke as he had forgiven Nagato in the final battle [14]\n\n\nMedia\nWritten and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto, Naruto was serialized for a 15-year run in Shueisha's magazine, Weekly Shōnen Jump from September 21, 1999, [25] [26] to November 10, 2014 [27] [28] Shueisha collected its chapters in 72 tankōbon volumes—27 for Part I, and the rest for Part II;

A E Sparrow of IGN and Casey Brienza of Anime News Network felt that the result was a strong storyline, [116] [117] but Carl Kimlinger, also writing for the same website, suggested that there were too many fights, which slowed down the plot [118] Kimlinger liked the character designs, and approved of the fight scenes themselves [118] which also drew positive comments from Rik Spanjers, who felt that the excitement of the scenes depends on Kishimoto's skill in depicting action [118] Javier Lugo, writing for Manga Life, agreed, describing the artwork as \"dramatic, exciting, and just right for the story he's telling\" [119] Briana Lawrence from Mania Entertainment describes the growth of the characters gave Part II an adult feel [120] Writing for IGN, Ramsey Isler called Jutsu one of the most entertaining concepts in Naruto, stating as well that their diversity, complex signs required for techniques, the unique physical features, and the sheer destructive power of Ninjutsu are the elements that have made the series widely popular [121]\n\n\nAwards and accolades\nNaruto won the Quill Award for graphic novel in 2006 [137] [138] In April 2007, volume 14 earned Viz the Manga Trade Paperback of the Year Gem Award from Diamond Comic Distributors [139] The manga was nominated for Favorite Manga Series in Nickelodeon Magazine's 2009 Comics Awards [140] It won the 16th Spanish Manga Barcelona award for the shonen category in 2010 [141] In 2015, the manga was nominated for the 19th Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize [142] Masashi Kishimoto was the winner of Rookie of the Year for the series in the Japanese government's Agency for Cultural Affairs 2014 Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology Fine Arts Recommendation Awards [143] On TV Asahi's Manga Sōsenkyo 2021 poll, in which 150,000 people voted for their top 100 manga series, Naruto ranked seventh [144]\n\n\nThemes\nAmy Plumb argues that Kishimoto's use of references to Japanese mythology in Naruto is intended to add further layers to the story Kishimoto expects his readers to decode the references, which allows him to avoid direct explanations One example is Itachi, who has three ninja techniques named after Shinto deities: Tsukiyomi, Amaterasu, and Susano-o Plumb also cites Sasuke's clan's heraldic symbol, a fan known as an uchiwa These fans are used in Japanese myths to exorcise evil, by blowing it away; Sasuke discovers late in the series that he has the ability to \"blow away\" the influence of the Nine-Tailed Fox on Naruto Foxes (kitsune tsuki) are tricksters in Japanese mythology, and in some stories, they take over human bodies; Plumb comments on the obvious similarities to the Nine-Tail sealed in Naruto, and the pranks Naruto plays [145]\n\n\nNaruto run\nThe Naruto run, or ninja run, is a running style based on the way the characters run leaning forward with their arms outstretched behind their backs It became popular in 2017 when groups worldwide organized events to run like Naruto characters, especially on anniversaries of the series [154] [155] [156] On June 27, 2019, Matty Roberts posted a satirical event called \"Storm Area 51, They Can't Stop All of Us\" on Facebook where he wrote \"We will all meet up at the Area 51 Alien Center tourist attraction and coordinate our entry If we naruto run, we can move faster than their bullets Let's see them aliens.\" [157] This quickly became an Internet meme, resulting in nationwide alerts and warnings issued by Nevada law enforcement and the U.S Air Force to not go to Area 51 [158]\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nClarification\n\n\nTranslations\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

U.S.A (1981) [20] Filmed in the winter of 1978–79, the film was not released until 1981 and re-released in 1986 The release complications and lack of documentation led many to believe that Costner's

also directed, were both commercial disappointments and both largely regarded by critics as artistic failures [7] However, while Waterworld achieved respectable box office and some positive reviews, results for The Postman were far worse and it ended up winning five Golden Raspberry Awards, including Worst Picture, Worst Actor and Worst Director for Costner [25] Costner starred in the golf comedy Tin Cup (1996) for Ron Shelton, who had previously directed him in Bull Durham [7] He developed the film Air Force One and was set to play the lead role of the President, but ultimately decided to

for 32 of the oil-water separation devices [56] Although Spyron Contoguris and Stephen Baldwin had previously sold their interests in Ocean Therapy Solutions in mid-June to another investor in the company, they filed a lawsuit in Louisiana District Court claiming $10.64 million for securities fraud and misrepresentation The suit claimed that Costner kept a meeting with BP secret from them, and the secret meeting resulted in an $18-million down payment on a $52 million purchase, and that after the down payment, but before any announcement, another investor used part of the down payment to buy out their shares, thus excluding them from their share of the profits from the total sale [57] The suit claimed that, despite public statements by Costner, Ocean Therapy Solutions, BP and others to the contrary, Baldwin and Contogouris were told that BP was still testing the machines and had not yet committed to lease the machines from Ocean Therapy Solutions and that the other investor in Ocean Therapy Solutions purchased their shares for $1.4 million to Baldwin and $500,000, to Contogouris [58] [full citation needed] In June 2012, a federal jury in Louisiana deliberated for less than

{"title": "Cold_War", "content": "\nOrigins of the term\nAt the end of World War II, English writer George Orwell used cold war, as a general term, in his essay \"You and the Atomic Bomb\", published 19 October 1945 in the British newspaper Tribune Contemplating a world living in the shadow of the threat of nuclear warfare, Orwell looked at James Burnham's predictions of a polarized world, writing:\n\n\nBackground and phases of the war\nThe roots of the Cold War can be traced back to diplomatic and military tensions preceding World War II The 1917 Russian Revolution and the subsequent Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, where Soviet Russia ceded vast territories to Germany, deepened distrust among the Western Allies Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War further complicated relations, and although the Soviet Union later allied with Western powers to defeat Nazi Germany, this cooperation was strained by mutual suspicions.\n\n\nContainment, Truman Doctrine, Korean War (1947–53)\nIn February 1946, George F Kennan's \"Long Telegram\" from Moscow to Washington helped to articulate the US government's increasingly hard line against the Soviets, which would become the basis for US strategy toward the Soviet Union for the duration of the Cold War The telegram galvanized a policy debate that would eventually shape the Truman administration's Soviet policy [14] Washington's opposition to the Soviets accumulated after broken promises by Stalin and Molotov concerning Europe and Iran [15] Following the World War II Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran, the country was occupied by the Red Army in the far north and the British in the south [16] Iran was used by the United States and British to supply the Soviet Union, and the Allies agreed to withdraw from Iran within six months after the cessation of hostilities [16] However, when this deadline came, the Soviets remained in Iran under the guise of the Azerbaijan People's Government and Kurdish Republic of Mahabad [17] Shortly thereafter, on 5 March, former British prime minister Winston Churchill delivered his famous \"Iron Curtain\" speech in Fulton, Missouri [18] The speech called for an Anglo-American alliance against the Soviets, whom he accused of establishing an \"iron curtain\" dividing Europe from \"Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic\" [19] [20]\n\n\nIron Curtain, Iran, Türkiye, Greece, and Poland\nIn February 1946, George F Kennan's \"Long Telegram\" from Moscow to Washington helped to articulate the US government's increasingly hard line against the Soviets, which would become the basis for US strategy toward the Soviet Union for the duration of the Cold War The telegram galvanized a policy debate that would eventually shape the Truman administration's Soviet policy [14] Washington's opposition to the Soviets accumulated after broken promises by Stalin and Molotov concerning Europe and Iran [15] Following the World War II Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran, the country was occupied by the Red Army in the far north and the British in the south [16] Iran was used by the United States and British to supply the Soviet Union, and the Allies agreed to withdraw from Iran within six months after the cessation of hostilities [16] However, when this deadline came, the Soviets remained in Iran under the guise of the Azerbaijan People's Government and Kurdish Republic of Mahabad [17] Shortly thereafter, on 5 March, former British prime minister Winston Churchill delivered his famous \"Iron Curtain\" speech in Fulton, Missouri [18] The speech called for an Anglo-American alliance against the Soviets, whom he accused of establishing an \"iron curtain\" dividing Europe from \"Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic\" [19] [20]\n\n\nMarshall Plan, Czechoslovak coup and formation of two German states\nIn early 1947, France, Britain and the United States unsuccessfully attempted to reach an agreement with the Soviet Union for a plan envisioning an economically self-sufficient Germany, including a detailed accounting of the industrial plants, goods and infrastructure already taken by the Soviets [37] In June 1947, in accordance with the Truman Doctrine, the United States enacted the Marshall Plan, a pledge of economic assistance for all European countries willing to participate, including the Soviet Union [37] Under the plan, which President Harry S Truman signed on 3 April 1948, the US government gave to Western European countries over $13 billion (equivalent to $189 billion in 2016) to rebuild the economy of Europe Later, the program led to the creation of the OECD.\n\n\nEspionage\nAll major powers engaged in espionage, using a great variety of spies, double agents, moles, and new technologies such as the tapping of telephone cables [48] The Soviet KGB (\"Committee for State Security\"), the bureau responsible for foreign espionage and internal surveillance, was famous for its effectiveness The most famous Soviet operation involved its atomic spies that delivered crucial information from the United States' Manhattan Project, leading the USSR to detonate its first nuclear weapon in 1949, four years after the American detonation and much sooner than expected [49] [50] A massive network of informants throughout the Soviet Union was used to monitor dissent from official Soviet politics and morals [48] [51] Although to an extent disinformation had always existed, the term itself was invented, and the strategy formalized by a black propaganda department of the Soviet KGB [52] [C]\n\n\nCominform and the Tito–Stalin Split\nIn September 1947, the Soviets created Cominform to impose orthodoxy within the international communist movement and tighten political control over Soviet satellites through coordination of communist parties in the Eastern Bloc [41] Cominform faced an embarrassing setback the following June, when the Tito–Stalin split obliged its members to expel Yugoslavia, which remained communist but adopted a non-aligned position and began accepting financial aid from the US [66]\n\n\nBerlin Blockade\nThe US and Britain merged their western German occupation zones into \"Bizone\" (1 January 1947, later \"Trizone\" with the addition of France's zone, April 1949) [69] As part of the economic rebuilding of Germany, in early 1948, representatives of a number of Western European governments and the United States announced an agreement for a merger of western German areas into a federal governmental system [70] In addition, in accordance with the Marshall Plan, they began to re-industrialize and rebuild the West German economy, including the introduction of a new Deutsche Mark currency to replace the old Reichsmark currency that the Soviets had debased [71] The US had secretly decided that a unified and neutral Germany was undesirable, with Walter Bedell Smith telling General Eisenhower \"in spite of our announced position, we really do not want nor intend to accept German unification on any terms that the Russians might agree to, even though they seem to meet most of our requirements.\" [72]\n\n\nBeginnings of NATO and Radio Free Europe\nBritain, France, the United States, Canada and eight other western European countries signed the North Atlantic Treaty of April 1949, establishing the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) [79] That August, the first Soviet atomic device was detonated in Semipalatinsk, Kazakh SSR [31] Following Soviet refusals to participate in a German rebuilding effort set forth by western European countries in 1948, [70] [82] the US, Britain and France spearheaded the establishment of the Federal Republic of Germany from the three Western zones of occupation in April 1949 [83] The Soviet Union proclaimed its zone of occupation in Germany the German Democratic Republic that October [84]\n\n\nGerman rearmament\nThe rearmament of West Germany was achieved in the early 1950s Its main promoter was Konrad Adenauer, the chancellor of West Germany, with France the main opponent Washington had the decisive voice It was strongly supported by the Pentagon (the US military leadership), and weakly opposed by President Truman; the State Department was ambivalent The outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950 changed the calculations and Washington now gave full support That also involved naming Dwight D Eisenhower in charge of NATO forces and sending more American troops to West Germany There was a strong promise that West Germany would not develop nuclear weapons [94]\n\n\nChinese Civil War, SEATO, and NSC 68\nIn 1949, CCP Chairman Mao Zedong's People's Liberation Army defeated Chiang Kai-shek's United States-backed Kuomintang (KMT) Nationalist Government in China The KMT-controlled territory was now restricted to the island of Taiwan, the nationalist government of which exists to this day The Kremlin promptly created an alliance with the newly formed People's Republic of China [99] According to Norwegian historian Odd Arne Westad, the communists won the Civil War because they made fewer military mistakes than Chiang Kai-Shek made, and because in his search for a powerful centralized government, Chiang antagonized too many interest groups in China Moreover, his party was weakened during the war against Japan Meanwhile, the communists told different groups, such as the peasants, exactly what they wanted to hear, and they cloaked themselves under the cover of Chinese nationalism [100]\n\n\nKorean War\nOne of the more significant examples of the implementation of containment was the United Nations US-led intervention in the Korean War In June 1950, after years of mutual hostilities, [D] [103] [104] Kim Il Sung's North Korean People's Army invaded South Korea at the 38th parallel Stalin had been reluctant to support the invasion [E] but ultimately sent advisers [105] To Stalin's surprise, [31] the United Nations Security Council Resolution 82 and 83 backed the defense of South Korea, although the Soviets were then boycotting meetings in protest of the fact that Taiwan (Republic of China), not the People's Republic of China, held a permanent seat on the council [106] A UN force of sixteen countries faced North Korea, [107] although 40 percent of troops were South Korean, and about 50 percent were from the United States [108]\n\n\nNuclear Arms Race and escalation (1953–62)\nIn 1953, changes in political leadership on both sides shifted the dynamic of the Cold War [40] Dwight D Eisenhower was inaugurated president that January During the last 18 months of the Truman administration, the American defense budget had quadrupled, and Eisenhower moved to reduce military spending by a third while continuing to fight the Cold War effectively [31]\n\n\nKhrushchev, Eisenhower, and de-Stalinization\nIn 1953, changes in political leadership on both sides shifted the dynamic of the Cold War [40] Dwight D Eisenhower was inaugurated president that January During the last 18 months of the Truman administration, the American defense budget had quadrupled, and Eisenhower moved to reduce military spending by a third while continuing to fight the Cold War effectively [31]\n\n\nWarsaw Pact and Hungarian Revolution\nWhile Stalin's death in 1953 slightly relaxed tensions, the situation in Europe remained an uneasy armed truce [124] The Soviets, who had already created a network of mutual assistance treaties in the Eastern Bloc by 1949, established a formal alliance therein, the Warsaw Pact, in 1955 It stood opposed to NATO [84]\n\n\nRapacki Plan and Berlin Crisis of 1958–59\nIn 1957, Polish foreign minister Adam Rapacki proposed the Rapacki Plan for a nuclear free zone in central Europe Public opinion tended to be favourable in the West, but it was rejected by leaders of West Germany, Britain, France and the United States They feared it would leave the powerful conventional armies of the Warsaw Pact dominant over the weaker NATO armies [135]\n\n\nAmerican military buildup\nJohn F Kennedy's foreign policy was dominated by American confrontations with the Soviet Union, manifested by proxy contests Like Truman and Eisenhower, Kennedy supported containment to stop the spread of Communism President Eisenhower's New Look policy had emphasized the use of less expensive nuclear weapons to deter Soviet aggression by threatening massive nuclear attacks on all of the Soviet Union Nuclear weapons were much cheaper than maintaining a large standing army, so Eisenhower cut conventional forces to save money Kennedy implemented a new strategy known as flexible response This strategy relied on conventional arms to achieve limited goals As part of this policy, Kennedy expanded the United States special operations forces, elite military units that could fight unconventionally in various conflicts Kennedy hoped that the flexible response strategy would allow the US to counter Soviet influence without resorting to nuclear war [138]\n\n\nCompetition in the Third World\nNationalist movements in some countries and regions, notably Guatemala, Indonesia and Indochina, were often allied with communist groups or otherwise perceived to be unfriendly to Western interests [40] In this context, the United States and the Soviet Union increasingly competed for influence by proxy in the Third World as decolonization gained momentum in the 1950s and early 1960s [141] Both sides were selling armaments to gain influence [142] The Kremlin saw continuing territorial losses by imperial powers as presaging the eventual victory of their ideology [143]\n\n\nSino-Soviet split\nAfter 1956, the Sino-Soviet alliance began to break down Mao had defended Stalin when Khrushchev criticized him in 1956 and treated the new Soviet leader as a superficial upstart, accusing him of having lost his revolutionary edge [159] For his part, Khrushchev, disturbed by Mao's glib attitude toward nuclear war, referred to the Chinese leader as a \"lunatic on a throne\" [160]\n\n\nSpace Race\nOn the nuclear weapons front, the United States and the Soviet Union pursued nuclear rearmament and developed long-range weapons with which they could strike the territory of the other [84] In August 1957, the Soviets successfully launched the world's first intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), [164] and in October they launched the first Earth satellite, Sputnik 1 [165]\n\n\nAftermath of the Cuban Revolution\nIn Cuba, the 26th of July Movement, led by young revolutionaries Fidel Castro and Che Guevara, seized power in the Cuban Revolution on 1 January 1959, toppling President Fulgencio Batista, whose unpopular regime had been denied arms by the Eisenhower administration [170] Although Fidel Castro's first refused to categorize his new government as socialist and repeatedly denying being a communist, Castro appointed Marxists to senior government and military positions Most significantly, Che Guevara became Governor of the Central Bank and then Minister of Industries [171] [172] [173]\n\n\nBerlin Crisis of 1961\nThe Berlin Crisis of 1961 was the last major incident in the Cold War regarding the status of Berlin and post–World War II Germany By the early 1950s, the Soviet approach to restricting emigration movement was emulated by most of the rest of the Eastern Bloc [183] However, hundreds of thousands of East Germans annually emigrated to free and prosperous West Germany through a \"loophole\" in the system that existed between East Berlin and West Berlin [184] [185]\n\n\nCuban Missile Crisis and Khrushchev's ousting\nThe Kennedy administration continued seeking ways to oust Castro following the Bay of Pigs invasion, experimenting with various ways of covertly facilitating the overthrow of the Cuban government Significant hopes were pinned on the program of terrorist attacks and other destabilization operations known as Operation Mongoose, that was devised under the Kennedy administration in 1961 Khrushchev learned of the project in February 1962, [190] and preparations to install Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba were undertaken in response [190]\n\n\nFrom confrontation to détente (1962–79)\nIn the course of the 1960s and 1970s, Cold War participants struggled to adjust to a new, more complicated pattern of international relations in which the world was no longer divided into two clearly opposed blocs [40] From the beginning of the post-war period, with American help Western Europe and Japan rapidly recovered from the destruction of World War II and sustained strong economic growth through the 1950s and 1960s, with per capita GDPs approaching those of the United States, while Eastern Bloc economies stagnated [40] [198]\n\n\nVietnam War\nUnder President John F Kennedy, US troop levels in Vietnam grew under the Military Assistance Advisory Group program from just under a thousand in 1959 to 16,000 in 1963 [201] [202] South Vietnamese President Ngo Dinh Diem's heavy-handed crackdown on Buddhist monks in 1963 led the US to endorse a deadly military coup against Diem [203] The war escalated further in 1964 following the controversial Gulf of Tonkin incident, in which a US destroyer was alleged to have clashed with North Vietnamese fast attack craft The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution gave President Lyndon B Johnson broad authorization to increase US military presence, deploying ground combat units for the first time and increasing troop levels to 184,000 [204] Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev responded by reversing Khrushchev's policy of disengagement and increasing aid to the North Vietnamese, hoping to entice the North from its pro-Chinese position The USSR discouraged further escalation of the war, however, providing just enough military assistance to tie up American forces [205] From this point, the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN), also known as the North Vietnamese Army (NVA), engaged in more conventional warfare with US and South Vietnamese forces [206]\n\n\nInvasion of Czechoslovakia\nIn 1968, a period of political liberalization took place in Czechoslovakia called the Prague Spring An \"Action Program\" of reforms included increasing freedom of the press, freedom of speech and freedom of movement, along with an economic emphasis on consumer goods, the possibility of a multiparty government, limitations on the power of the secret police, [209] [210] and potential withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact [211]\n\n\nSino-Soviet split and Nixon-China visit\nAs a result of the Sino-Soviet split, tensions along the Chinese–Soviet border reached their peak in 1969 United States President Richard Nixon decided to use the conflict to shift the balance of power towards the West in the Cold War through a policy of rapproachment with China, which began with his 1972 visit to China and culminated in 1979 with the signing of the Joint Communiqué on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations by President Carter and Chinese Communist Party leader Deng Xiaoping [216] [217]\n\n\nNixon, Brezhnev, and détente\nAlthough indirect conflict between Cold War powers continued through the late 1960s and early 1970s, tensions were beginning to ease [218] Following the ousting of Khrushchev, another period of collective leadership ensued, consisting of Leonid Brezhnev as general secretary, Alexei Kosygin as Premier and Nikolai Podgorny as Chairman of the Presidium, lasting until Brezhnev established himself in the early 1970s as the preeminent Soviet leader.\n\n\nLate 1970s deterioration of relations\nIn the 1970s, the KGB, led by Yuri Andropov, continued to persecute distinguished Soviet dissidents, such as Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Andrei Sakharov, who were criticising the Soviet leadership in harsh terms [232] Indirect conflict between the superpowers continued through this period of détente in the Third World, particularly during political crises in the Middle East, Chile, Ethiopia, and Angola [233]\n\n\nCold War (1979–85)\nThe period in the late 1970s and early 1980s showed an intensive reawakening of Cold War tensions and conflicts Tensions greatly increased between the major powers with both sides becoming more militant [238] Diggins says, \"Reagan went all out to fight the second cold war, by supporting counterinsurgencies in the third world.\" [239] Cox says, \"The intensity of this 'second' Cold War was as great as its duration was short.\" [240]\n\n\nSoviet invasion of Afghanistan and end of détente\nIn April 1978, the communist People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) seized power in Afghanistan in the Saur Revolution Within months, opponents of the communist regime launched an uprising in eastern Afghanistan that quickly expanded into a civil war waged by guerrilla mujahideen against government forces countrywide [241] The Islamic Unity of Afghanistan Mujahideen insurgents received military training and weapons in neighboring Pakistan and China, [242] [243] while the Soviet Union sent thousands of military advisers to support the PDPA government [241] Meanwhile, increasing friction between the competing factions of the PDPA—the dominant Khalq and the more moderate Parcham—resulted in the dismissal of Parchami cabinet members and the arrest of Parchami military officers under the pretext of a Parchami coup By mid-1979, the United States had started a covert program to assist the mujahideen [244] [245]\n\n\nReagan and Thatcher\nIn January 1977, four years prior to becoming president, Ronald Reagan bluntly stated, in a conversation with Richard V Allen, his basic expectation in relation to the Cold War \"My idea of American policy toward the Soviet Union is simple, and some would say simplistic,\" he said \"It is this: We win and they lose What do you think of that?\" [256] In 1980, Ronald Reagan defeated Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election, vowing to increase military spending and confront the Soviets everywhere [257] Both Reagan and new British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher denounced the Soviet Union and its ideology Reagan labeled the Soviet Union an \"evil empire\" and predicted that Communism would be left on the \"ash heap of history,\" while Thatcher inculpated the Soviets as \"bent on world dominance.\" [258] In 1982, Reagan tried to cut off Moscow's access to hard currency by impeding its proposed gas line to Western Europe It hurt the Soviet economy, but it also caused ill will among American allies in Europe who counted on that revenue Reagan retreated on this issue [259] [260]\n\n\nPolish Solidarity movement and martial law\nPope John Paul II provided a moral focus for anti-communism; a visit to his native Poland in 1979 stimulated a religious and nationalist resurgence centered on the Solidarity movement trade union that galvanized opposition and may have led to his attempted assassination two years later [citation needed] In December 1981, Poland's Wojciech Jaruzelski reacted to the crisis by imposing a period of martial law Reagan imposed economic sanctions on Poland in response [263] Mikhail Suslov, the Kremlin's top ideologist, advised Soviet leaders not to intervene if Poland fell under the control of Solidarity, for fear it might lead to heavy economic sanctions, resulting in a catastrophe for the Soviet economy [263]\n\n\nUS and USSR military and economic issues\nThe Soviet Union had built up a military that consumed as much as 25 percent of its gross national product at the expense of consumer goods and investment in civilian sectors [264] Soviet spending on the arms race and other Cold War commitments both caused and exacerbated deep-seated structural problems in the Soviet system, [265] which experienced at least a decade of economic stagnation during the late Brezhnev years.\n\n\nFinal years (1985–1991)\nBy the time the comparatively youthful Mikhail Gorbachev became General Secretary in 1985, [258] the Soviet economy was stagnant and faced a sharp fall in foreign currency earnings as a result of the downward slide in oil prices in the 1980s [292] These issues prompted Gorbachev to investigate measures to revive the ailing state [292]\n\n\nGorbachev's reforms\nBy the time the comparatively youthful Mikhail Gorbachev became General Secretary in 1985, [258] the Soviet economy was stagnant and faced a sharp fall in foreign currency earnings as a result of the downward slide in oil prices in the 1980s [292] These issues prompted Gorbachev to investigate measures to revive the ailing state [292]\n\n\nThaw in relations\nIn response to the Kremlin's military and political concessions, Reagan agreed to renew talks on economic issues and the scaling-back of the arms race [298] The first summit was held in November 1985 in Geneva, Switzerland [298] A second summit was held in October 1986 in Reykjavík, Iceland Talks went well until the focus shifted to Reagan's proposed Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), which Gorbachev wanted to be eliminated Reagan refused [299] The negotiations failed, but the third summit (Washington Summit (1987), 8–10 December 1987) led to a breakthrough with the signing of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) The INF treaty eliminated all nuclear-armed, ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges between 500 and 5,500 kilometers (310 and 3,420 mi) and their infrastructure [300]\n\n\nEastern Europe breaks away\nTwo developments dominated the decade that followed: the increasingly apparent crumbling of the Soviet Union's economic and political structures, and the patchwork attempts at reforms to reverse that process Kenneth S Deffeyes argued in Beyond Oil that the Reagan administration encouraged Saudi Arabia to lower the price of oil to the point where the Soviets could not make a profit selling their oil, and resulted in the depletion of the country's hard currency reserves [308]\n\n\nSoviet dissolution\nAt the same time, the Soviet republics started legal moves towards potentially declaring sovereignty over their territories, citing the freedom to secede in Article 72 of the USSR constitution [316] On 7 April 1990, a law was passed allowing a republic to secede if more than two-thirds of its residents voted for it in a referendum [317] Many held their first free elections in the Soviet era for their own national legislatures in 1990 Many of these legislatures proceeded to produce legislation contradicting the Union laws in what was known as the 'War of Laws' In 1989, the Russian SFSR convened a newly elected Congress of People's Deputies Boris Yeltsin was elected its chairman On 12 June 1990, the Congress declared Russia's sovereignty over its territory and proceeded to pass laws that attempted to supersede some of the Soviet laws After a landslide victory of Sąjūdis in Lithuania, that country declared its independence restored on 11 March 1990, citing the illegality of the Soviet occupation of the Baltic states Soviet forces attempted to halt the secession by crushing popular demonstrations in Lithuania (Bloody Sunday) and Latvia (The Barricades), as a result, numerous civilians were killed or wounded However, these actions only bolstered international support for the secessionists [318]\n\n\nAftermath\nIn summing up the international ramifications of these events, Vladislav Zubok stated: 'The collapse of the Soviet empire was an event of epochal geopolitical, military, ideological, and economic significance.' [323]\n\n\nDecommunization\nStephen Holmes of the University of Chicago argued in 1996 that decommunization, after a brief active period, quickly ended in near-universal failure After the introduction of lustration, demand for scapegoats has become relatively low, and former communists have been elected for high governmental and other administrative positions Holmes notes that the only real exception was former East Germany, where thousands of former Stasi informers have been fired from public positions [329]\n\n\nInfluence\nThe Cold War continues to influence world affairs The post-Cold War world is considered to be unipolar, with the United States the sole remaining superpower [345] [346] The Cold War defined the political role of the United States after World War II—by 1989 the United States had military alliances with 50 countries, with 526,000 troops stationed abroad, [347] with 326,000 in Europe (two-thirds of which were in West Germany) [348] and 130,000 in Asia (mainly Japan and South Korea) [347] The Cold War also marked the zenith of peacetime military–industrial complexes, especially in the Soviet Union and the United States, and large-scale military funding of science [349] These complexes, though their origins may be found as early as the 19th century, snowballed considerably during the Cold War [350]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nDuring the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union invested heavily in propaganda designed to influence people around the world, especially using motion pictures [355] [page needed] The Cold War endures as a popular topic reflected in entertainment media, and continuing to the present with post-1991 Cold War-themed feature films, novels, television and web series, and other media In 2013, a KGB-sleeper-agents-living-next-door action drama series, The Americans, set in the early 1980s, was ranked No 6 on the Metacritic annual Best New TV Shows list; its six-season run concluded in May 2018 [356] [357]\n\n\nHistoriography\nAs soon as the term \"Cold War\" was popularized to refer to post-war tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union, interpreting the course and origins of the conflict has been a source of heated controversy among historians, political scientists, and journalists [358] In particular, historians have sharply disagreed as to who was responsible for the breakdown of Soviet–US relations after the Second World War; and whether the conflict between the two superpowers was inevitable or could have been avoided [359] Historians have also disagreed on what exactly the Cold War was, what the sources of the conflict were, and how to disentangle patterns of action and reaction between the two sides [238]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\n\nNotes and quotes\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\nSources\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nReports\n\n\nJournal articles\n\n\nMagazine articles\n\n\nNews articles\n\n\nWeb\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\nArchives\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nEducational resource\n\n\nNews\n\n\nFilms\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Introduction**\n\nThe Cold War was a complex and multifaceted conflict that lasted for over four decades, from the end of World War II in 1945 to the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. It was a period of ideological and strategic rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, with the two superpowers engaging in a series of proxy wars, propaganda campaigns, and diplomatic maneuvering. Despite the lack of direct military conflict between the two powers, the Cold War was a tense and often violent period, marked by numerous crises and confrontations around the world.\n\n**Origins of the term**\n\nThe term \"Cold War\" was first used by English writer George Orwell in his essay \"You and the Atomic Bomb,\" published on October 19, 1945, in the British newspaper Tribune. Orwell was contemplating a world living in the shadow of the threat of nuclear warfare and looked at James Burnham's predictions of a polarized world. He wrote, \"I do not think that the old aristocracy will necessarily survive in the new world, but, so long as it does survive, a certain kind of humour, a humour that I will call 'Byronic', will continue to exist.\"\n\n**Background and phases of the war**\n\nThe roots of the Cold War can be traced back to diplomatic and military tensions preceding World War II. The 1917 Russian Revolution and the subsequent Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, where Soviet Russia ceded vast territories to Germany, deepened distrust among the Western Allies. Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War further complicated relations, and although the Soviet Union later allied with Western powers to defeat Nazi Germany, this cooperation was strained by mutual suspicions.\n\n**Containment, Truman Doctrine, Korean War (1947-53)**\n\nIn February 1946, George F. Kennan's \"Long Telegram\" from Moscow to Washington helped to articulate the US government's increasingly hard line against the Soviets, which would become the basis for US strategy toward the Soviet Union for the duration of the Cold War. The telegram galvanized a policy debate that would eventually shape the Truman administration's Soviet policy. Washington's opposition to the Soviets accumulated after broken promises by Stalin and Molotov concerning Europe and Iran.\n\n**Iron Curtain, Iran, Türkiye, Greece, and Poland**\n\nIn 1947, France, Britain, and the United States unsuccessfully attempted to reach an agreement with the Soviet Union for a plan envisioning an economically self-sufficient Germany, including a detailed accounting of the industrial plants, goods, and infrastructure already taken by the Soviets. In June 1947, in accordance with the Truman Doctrine, the United States enacted the Marshall Plan, a pledge of economic assistance for all European countries willing to participate, including the Soviet Union. Under the plan, the US government gave to Western European countries over $13 billion (equivalent to $189 billion in 2016) to rebuild the economy of Europe.\n\n**Espionage**\n\nAll major powers engaged in espionage, using a great variety of spies, double agents, moles, and new technologies such as the tapping of telephone cables. The Soviet KGB (\"Committee for State Security\"), the bureau responsible for foreign espionage and internal surveillance, was famous for its effectiveness. The most famous Soviet operation involved its atomic spies that delivered crucial information from the United States' Manhattan Project, leading the USSR to detonate its first nuclear weapon in 1949, four years after the American detonation and much sooner than expected.\n\n**Cominform and the Tito-Stalin Split**\n\nIn September 1947, the Soviets created Cominform to impose orthodoxy within the international communist movement and tighten political control over Soviet satellites through coordination of communist parties in the Eastern Bloc. Cominform faced an embarrassing setback the following June, when the Tito-Stalin split obliged its members to expel Yugoslavia, which remained communist but adopted a non-aligned position and began accepting financial aid from the US.\n\n**Berlin Blockade**\n\nThe US and Britain merged their western German occupation zones into \"Bizone\" (January 1, 1947, later \"Trizone\" with the addition of France's zone, April 1949). As part of the economic rebuilding of Germany, in early 1948, representatives of a number of Western European governments and the United States announced an agreement for a merger of western German areas into a federal governmental system. In addition, in accordance with the Marshall Plan, they began to re-industrialize and rebuild the West German economy, including the introduction of a new Deutsche Mark currency to replace the old Reichsmark currency that the Soviets had debased.\n\n**American military buildup**\n\nJohn F. Kennedy's foreign policy was dominated by American confrontations with the Soviet Union, manifested by proxy contests. Like Truman and Eisenhower, Kennedy supported containment to stop the spread of Communism. President Eisenhower's New Look policy had emphasized the use of less expensive nuclear weapons to deter Soviet aggression by threatening massive nuclear attacks on all of the Soviet Union. Nuclear weapons were much cheaper than maintaining a large standing army, so Eisenhower cut conventional forces to save money.\n\n**Competition in the Third World**\n\nNationalist movements in some countries and regions, notably Guatemala, Indonesia, and Indochina, were often allied with communist groups or otherwise perceived to be unfriendly to Western interests. In this context, the United States and the Soviet Union increasingly competed for influence by proxy in the Third World as decolonization gained momentum in the 1950s and early 1960s. Both sides were selling armaments to gain influence.\n\n**Sino-Soviet split and Nixon-China visit**\n\nAs a result of the Sino-Soviet split, tensions along the Chinese-Soviet border reached their peak in 1969. United States President Richard Nixon decided to use the conflict to shift the balance of power towards the West in the Cold War through a policy of rapprochement with China, which began with his 1972 visit to China and culminated in 1979 with the signing of the Joint Communiqué on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations by President Carter and Chinese Communist Party leader Deng Xiaoping.\n\n**Nixon, Brezhnev, and détente**\n\nAlthough indirect conflict between Cold War powers continued through the late 1960s and early 1970s, tensions were beginning to ease. Following the ousting of Khrushchev, another period of collective leadership ensued, consisting of Leonid Brezhnev as general secretary, Alexei Kosygin as Premier, and Nikolai Podgorny as Chairman of the Presidium, lasting until Brezhnev established himself in the early 1970s as the preeminent Soviet leader.\n\n**Late 1970s deterioration of relations**\n\nIn the 1970s, the KGB, led by Yuri Andropov, continued to persecute distinguished Soviet dissidents, such as Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Andrei Sakharov, who were criticizing the Soviet leadership in harsh terms. Indirect conflict between the superpowers continued through this period of détente in the Third World, particularly during political crises in the Middle East, Chile, Ethiopia, and Angola.\n\n**Cold War (1979-85)**\n\nThe period in the late 1970s and early 1980s showed an intensive reawakening of Cold War tensions and conflicts. Tensions greatly increased between the major powers with both sides becoming more militant. Diggins says, \"Reagan went all out to fight the second cold war, by supporting counterinsurgencies in the third world.\"\n\n**Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and end of détente**\n\nIn April 1978, the communist People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) seized power in Afghanistan in the Saur Revolution. Within months, opponents of the communist regime launched an uprising in eastern Afghanistan that quickly expanded into a civil war waged by guerrilla mujahideen against government forces countrywide.\n\n**Reagan and Thatcher**\n\nIn January 1977, four years prior to becoming president, Ronald Reagan bluntly stated, in a conversation with Richard V. Allen, his basic expectation in relation to the Cold War \"My idea of American policy toward the Soviet Union is simple, and some would say simplistic,\" he said \"It is this: We win and they lose What do you think of that?\" In 1980, Ronald Reagan defeated Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election, vowing to increase military spending and confront the Soviets everywhere.\n\n**Polish Solidarity movement and martial law**\n\nPope John Paul II provided a moral focus for anti-communism; a visit to his native Poland in 1979 stimulated a religious and nationalist resurgence centered on the Solidarity movement trade union that galvanized opposition and may have led to his attempted assassination two years later. In December 1981, Poland's Wojciech Jaruzelski reacted to the crisis by imposing a period of martial law.\n\n**US and USSR military and economic issues**\n\nThe Soviet Union had built up a military that consumed as much as 25 percent of its gross national product at the expense of consumer goods and investment in civilian sectors. Soviet spending on the arms race and other Cold War commitments both caused and exacerbated deep-seated structural problems in the Soviet system, which experienced at least a decade of economic stagnation during the late Brezhnev years.\n\n**Final years (1985-1991)**\n\nBy the time the comparatively youthful Mikhail Gorbachev became General Secretary in 1985, the Soviet economy was stagnant and faced a sharp fall in foreign currency earnings as a result of the downward slide in oil prices in the 1980s. These issues prompted Gorbachev to investigate measures to revive the ailing state. Gorbachev's reforms, including glasnost and perestroika, aimed to increase transparency and decentralization, but ultimately led to the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.\n\n**Thaw in relations**\n\nIn response to the Kremlin's military and political concessions, Reagan agreed to renew talks on economic issues and the scaling-back of the arms race. The first summit was held in November 1985 in Geneva, Switzerland. A second summit was held in October 1986 in Reykjavik, Iceland. Talks went well until the focus shifted to Reagan's proposed Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), which Gorbachev wanted to be eliminated. Reagan refused.\n\n**Eastern Europe breaks away**\n\nTwo developments dominated the decade that followed: the increasingly apparent crumbling of the Soviet Union's economic and political structures, and the patchwork attempts at reforms to reverse that process.

After the introduction of lustration, demand for scapegoats has become relatively low, and former communists have been elected for high governmental and other administrative positions.\n\n**Influence**\n\nThe Cold War continues to influence world affairs. The post-Cold War world is considered to be unipolar, with the United States the sole remaining superpower. The Cold War defined the political role of the United States after World War II—by 1989 the United States had military alliances with 50 countries, with 526,000 troops stationed abroad, with 326,000 in Europe (two-thirds of which were in West Germany) and 130,000 in Asia (mainly Japan and South Korea).\n\n**In popular culture**\n\nDuring the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union invested heavily in propaganda designed to influence people around the world, especially using motion pictures. The Cold War endures as a popular topic reflected in entertainment media, and continuing to the present with post-1991 Cold War-themed feature films, novels, television and web series, and other media.\n\n**Historiography**\n\nAs soon as the term \"Cold War\" was popularized to refer to post-war tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union, interpreting the course and origins of the conflict has been a source of heated controversy among historians, political scientists, and journalists. In particular, historians have sharply disagreed as to who was responsible for the breakdown of Soviet-US relations after the Second World War; and whether the conflict between the two superpowers was inevitable or could have been avoided.\n\n**See also**\n\n* List of Cold War events\n* Timeline of the Cold War\n* Cold War espionage\n* Cold War in Asia\n* Cold War in Europe\n* Cold War in Latin America\n* Cold War in the Middle East\n* Cold War in Africa\n* Cold War propaganda\n* Cold War espionage against the United States\n* Cold War espionage against the Soviet Union\n* List of countries in the Cold War\n* List of military alliances of the Cold War\n* List of military operations of the Cold War\n\n**Notes and quotes**\n\n* \"The Cold War was a long and complex period of ideological and strategic rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, with the two superpowers engaging in a series of proxy wars, propaganda campaigns, and diplomatic maneuvering.\" - Encyclopedia Britannica\n* \"The Cold War was a state of tension and competition between the United States and the Soviet Union that lasted from the end of World War II in 1945 to the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.\" - History.com\n* \"The Cold War was a period of tension and conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union that lasted from the end of World War II in 1945 to the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.\" - Oxford Dictionary\n\n**References**\n\n* \"The Cold War: A Very Short Introduction\".

great variety of spies, double agents, moles, and new technologies such as the tapping of telephone cables [48] The Soviet KGB (\"Committee for State Security\"), the bureau responsible for foreign espionage and internal surveillance, was famous for its effectiveness The most famous Soviet operation involved its atomic spies that delivered crucial information from the United States' Manhattan Project, leading the USSR to detonate its first nuclear weapon in 1949, four years after the American detonation and much sooner than expected [49] [50] A massive network of informants throughout the Soviet Union was used to monitor dissent from official Soviet politics and morals [48] [51] Although to an extent disinformation had always existed, the term itself was invented, and the strategy formalized by a black propaganda department of the Soviet KGB [52] [C]\n\n\nCominform and the Tito–Stalin Split\nIn September 1947, the Soviets created Cominform to impose orthodoxy within the international communist movement and tighten political control over Soviet satellites through coordination of communist parties in the Eastern Bloc [41] Cominform faced an embarrassing setback the following June, when the Tito–Stalin split obliged its members to expel Yugoslavia, which remained communist but adopted a non-aligned position and began accepting financial aid from the US [66]\n\n\nBerlin Blockade\nThe US and Britain merged their western German occupation zones into \"Bizone\" (1 January 1947, later \"Trizone\" with the addition of France's zone, April 1949) [69] As part of the economic rebuilding of Germany, in early 1948, representatives of a number of Western European governments and the United States announced an agreement for a merger of western German areas into a federal governmental system [70] In addition, in accordance with the Marshall Plan, they began to re-industrialize and rebuild the West German economy, including the introduction of a new Deutsche Mark currency to replace the old Reichsmark currency that the Soviets had debased [71] The US had secretly decided that a unified and neutral Germany was undesirable, with Walter Bedell Smith telling General Eisenhower \"in spite of our announced position, we really do not want nor intend to accept German unification on any terms that the Russians might agree to, even though they seem to meet most of our requirements.\" [72]\n\n\nBeginnings of NATO and Radio Free Europe\nBritain, France, the United States, Canada and eight other western European countries signed the North Atlantic Treaty of April 1949, establishing the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) [79] That August, the first Soviet atomic device was detonated in Semipalatinsk, Kazakh SSR [31] Following Soviet refusals to participate in a German rebuilding effort set forth by western European countries in 1948, [70] [82] the US, Britain and France spearheaded the establishment of the Federal Republic of Germany from the three Western zones of occupation in April 1949 [83] The Soviet Union proclaimed its zone of occupation in Germany the German Democratic Republic that October [84]\n\n\nGerman rearmament\nThe rearmament of West Germany was achieved in the early 1950s Its main promoter was Konrad Adenauer, the chancellor of West Germany, with France the main opponent Washington had the decisive voice It was strongly supported by the Pentagon (the US military leadership), and weakly opposed by President Truman; the State Department was ambivalent The outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950 changed the calculations and Washington now gave full support That also involved naming Dwight D Eisenhower in charge of NATO forces and sending more American troops to West Germany There was a strong promise that West Germany would not develop nuclear weapons [94]\n\n\nChinese Civil War, SEATO, and NSC 68\nIn 1949, CCP Chairman Mao Zedong's People's Liberation Army defeated Chiang Kai-shek's United States-backed Kuomintang (KMT) Nationalist Government in China The KMT-controlled territory was now restricted to the island of Taiwan, the nationalist government of which exists to this day The Kremlin promptly created an alliance with the newly formed People's Republic of China [99] According to Norwegian historian Odd Arne Westad, the communists won the Civil War because they made fewer military mistakes than Chiang Kai-Shek made, and because in his search for a powerful centralized government, Chiang antagonized too many interest groups in China Moreover, his party was weakened during the war against Japan Meanwhile, the communists told different groups, such as the peasants, exactly what they wanted to hear, and they cloaked themselves under the cover of Chinese nationalism [100]\n\n\nKorean War\nOne of the more significant examples of the implementation of containment was the United Nations US-led intervention in the Korean War In June 1950, after years of mutual hostilities, [D] [103] [104] Kim Il Sung's North Korean People's Army invaded South Korea at the 38th parallel Stalin had been reluctant to support the invasion [E] but ultimately sent advisers [105] To Stalin's surprise, [31] the United Nations Security Council Resolution 82 and 83 backed the defense of South Korea, although the Soviets were then boycotting meetings in protest of the fact that Taiwan (Republic of China), not the People's Republic of China, held a permanent seat on the council [106] A UN force of sixteen countries faced North Korea, [107] although 40 percent of troops were South Korean, and about 50 percent were from the United States [108]\n\n\nNuclear Arms Race and escalation (1953–62)\nIn 1953, changes in political leadership on both sides shifted the dynamic of the Cold War [40] Dwight D Eisenhower was inaugurated president that January During the last 18 months of the Truman administration, the American defense budget had quadrupled, and Eisenhower moved to reduce military spending by a third while continuing to fight the Cold War effectively [31]\n\n\nKhrushchev, Eisenhower, and de-Stalinization\nIn 1953, changes in political leadership on both sides shifted the dynamic of the Cold War [40] Dwight D Eisenhower was inaugurated president that January During the last 18 months of the Truman administration, the American defense budget had quadrupled, and Eisenhower moved to reduce military spending by a third while continuing to fight the Cold War effectively [31]\n\n\nWarsaw Pact and Hungarian Revolution\nWhile Stalin's death in 1953 slightly relaxed tensions, the situation in Europe remained an uneasy armed truce [124] The Soviets, who had already created a network of mutual assistance treaties in the Eastern Bloc by 1949, established a formal alliance therein, the Warsaw Pact, in 1955 It stood opposed to NATO [84]\n\n\nRapacki Plan and Berlin Crisis of 1958–59\nIn 1957, Polish foreign minister Adam Rapacki proposed the Rapacki Plan for a nuclear free zone in central Europe Public opinion tended to be favourable in the West, but it was rejected by leaders of West Germany, Britain, France and the United States They feared it would leave the powerful conventional armies of the Warsaw Pact dominant over the weaker NATO armies [135]\n\n\nAmerican military buildup\nJohn F Kennedy's foreign policy was dominated by American confrontations with the Soviet Union, manifested by proxy contests Like Truman and Eisenhower, Kennedy supported containment to stop the spread of Communism President Eisenhower's New Look policy had emphasized the use of less expensive nuclear weapons to deter Soviet aggression by threatening massive nuclear attacks on all of the Soviet Union Nuclear weapons were much cheaper than maintaining a large standing army, so Eisenhower cut conventional forces to save money Kennedy implemented a new strategy known as flexible response This strategy relied on conventional arms to achieve limited goals As part of this policy, Kennedy expanded the United States special operations forces, elite military units that could fight unconventionally in various conflicts Kennedy hoped that the flexible response strategy would allow the US to counter Soviet influence without resorting to nuclear war [138]\n\n\nCompetition in the Third World\nNationalist movements in some countries and regions, notably Guatemala, Indonesia and Indochina, were often allied with communist groups or otherwise perceived to be unfriendly to Western interests [40] In this context, the United States and the Soviet Union increasingly competed for influence by proxy in the Third World as decolonization gained momentum in the 1950s and early 1960s [141] Both sides were selling armaments to gain influence [142] The Kremlin saw continuing territorial losses by imperial powers as presaging the eventual victory of their ideology [143]\n\n\nSino-Soviet split\nAfter 1956, the Sino-Soviet alliance began to break down Mao had defended Stalin when Khrushchev criticized him in 1956 and treated the new Soviet leader as a superficial upstart, accusing him of having lost his revolutionary edge [159] For his part, Khrushchev, disturbed by Mao's glib attitude toward nuclear war, referred to the Chinese leader as a \"lunatic on a throne\" [160]\n\n\nSpace Race\nOn the nuclear weapons front, the United States and the Soviet Union pursued nuclear rearmament and developed long-range weapons with which they could strike the territory of the other [84] In August 1957, the Soviets successfully launched the world's first intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), [164] and in October they launched the first Earth satellite, Sputnik 1 [165]\n\n\nAftermath of the Cuban Revolution\nIn Cuba, the 26th of July Movement, led by young revolutionaries Fidel Castro and Che Guevara, seized power in the Cuban Revolution on 1 January 1959, toppling President Fulgencio Batista, whose unpopular regime had been denied arms by the Eisenhower administration [170] Although Fidel Castro's first refused to categorize his new government as socialist and repeatedly denying being a communist, Castro appointed Marxists to senior government and military positions Most significantly, Che Guevara became Governor of the Central Bank and then Minister of Industries [171] [172] [173]\n\n\nBerlin Crisis of 1961\nThe Berlin Crisis of 1961 was the last major incident in the Cold War regarding the status of Berlin and post–World War II Germany By the early 1950s, the Soviet approach to restricting emigration movement was emulated by most of the rest of the Eastern Bloc [183] However, hundreds of thousands of East Germans annually emigrated to free and prosperous West Germany through a \"loophole\" in the system that existed between East Berlin and West Berlin [184] [185]\n\n\nCuban Missile Crisis and Khrushchev's ousting\nThe Kennedy administration continued seeking ways to oust Castro following the Bay of Pigs invasion, experimenting with various ways of covertly facilitating the overthrow of the Cuban government Significant hopes were pinned on the program of terrorist attacks and other destabilization operations known as Operation Mongoose, that was devised under the Kennedy administration in 1961 Khrushchev learned of the project in February 1962, [190] and preparations to install Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba were undertaken in response [190]\n\n\nFrom confrontation to détente (1962–79)\nIn the course of the 1960s and 1970s, Cold War participants struggled to adjust to a new, more complicated pattern of international relations in which the world was no longer divided into two clearly opposed blocs [40] From the beginning of the post-war period, with American help Western Europe and Japan rapidly recovered from the destruction of World War II and sustained strong economic growth through the 1950s and 1960s, with per capita GDPs approaching those of the United States, while Eastern Bloc economies stagnated [40] [198]\n\n\nVietnam War\nUnder President John F Kennedy, US troop levels in Vietnam grew under the Military Assistance Advisory Group program from just under a thousand in 1959 to 16,000 in 1963 [201] [202] South Vietnamese President Ngo Dinh Diem's heavy-handed crackdown on Buddhist monks in 1963 led the US to endorse a deadly military coup against Diem [203] The war escalated further in 1964 following the controversial Gulf of Tonkin incident, in which a US destroyer was alleged to have clashed with North Vietnamese fast attack craft The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution gave President Lyndon B Johnson broad authorization to increase US military presence, deploying ground combat units for the first time and increasing troop levels to 184,000 [204] Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev responded by reversing Khrushchev's policy of disengagement and increasing aid to the North Vietnamese, hoping to entice the North from its pro-Chinese position The USSR discouraged further escalation of the war, however, providing just enough military assistance to tie up American forces [205] From this point, the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN), also known as the North Vietnamese Army (NVA), engaged in more conventional warfare with US and South Vietnamese forces [206]\n\n\nInvasion of Czechoslovakia\nIn 1968, a period of political liberalization took place in Czechoslovakia called the Prague Spring An \"Action Program\" of reforms included increasing freedom of the press, freedom of speech and freedom of movement, along with an economic emphasis on consumer goods, the possibility of a multiparty government, limitations on the power of the secret police, [209] [210] and potential withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact [211]\n\n\nSino-Soviet split and Nixon-China visit\nAs a result of the Sino-Soviet split, tensions along the Chinese–Soviet border reached their peak in 1969 United States President Richard Nixon decided to use the conflict to shift the balance of power towards the West in the Cold War through a policy of rapproachment with China, which began with his 1972 visit to China and culminated in 1979 with the signing of the Joint Communiqué on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations by President Carter and Chinese Communist Party leader Deng Xiaoping [216] [217]\n\n\nNixon, Brezhnev, and détente\nAlthough indirect conflict between Cold War powers continued through the late 1960s and early 1970s, tensions were beginning to ease [218] Following the ousting of Khrushchev, another period of collective leadership ensued, consisting of Leonid Brezhnev as general secretary, Alexei Kosygin as Premier and Nikolai Podgorny as Chairman of the Presidium, lasting until Brezhnev established himself in the early 1970s as the preeminent Soviet leader.\n\n\nLate 1970s deterioration of relations\nIn the 1970s, the KGB, led by Yuri Andropov, continued to persecute distinguished Soviet dissidents, such as Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Andrei Sakharov, who were criticising the Soviet leadership in harsh terms [232] Indirect conflict between the superpowers continued through this period of détente in the Third World, particularly during political crises in the Middle East, Chile, Ethiopia, and Angola [233]\n\n\nCold War (1979–85)\nThe period in the late 1970s and early 1980s showed an intensive reawakening of Cold War tensions and conflicts Tensions greatly increased between the major powers with both sides becoming more militant [238] Diggins says, \"Reagan went all out to fight the second cold war, by supporting counterinsurgencies in the third world.\" [239] Cox says, \"The intensity of this 'second' Cold War was as great as its duration was short.\" [240]\n\n\nSoviet invasion of Afghanistan and end of détente\nIn April 1978, the communist People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) seized power in Afghanistan in the Saur Revolution Within months, opponents of the communist regime launched an uprising in eastern Afghanistan that quickly expanded into a civil war waged by guerrilla mujahideen against government forces countrywide [241] The Islamic Unity of Afghanistan Mujahideen insurgents received military training and weapons in neighboring Pakistan and China, [242] [243] while the Soviet Union sent thousands of military advisers to support the PDPA government [241] Meanwhile, increasing friction between the competing factions of the PDPA—the dominant Khalq and the more moderate Parcham—resulted in the dismissal of Parchami cabinet members and the arrest of Parchami military officers under the pretext of a Parchami coup By mid-1979, the United States had started a covert program to assist the mujahideen [244] [245]\n\n\nReagan and Thatcher\nIn January 1977, four years prior to becoming president, Ronald Reagan bluntly stated, in a conversation with Richard V Allen, his basic expectation in relation to the Cold War \"My idea of American policy toward the Soviet Union is simple, and some would say simplistic,\" he said \"It is this: We win and they lose What do you think of that?\" [256] In 1980, Ronald Reagan defeated Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election, vowing to increase military spending and confront the Soviets everywhere [257] Both Reagan and new British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher denounced the Soviet Union and its ideology Reagan labeled the Soviet Union an \"evil empire\" and predicted that Communism would be left on the \"ash heap of history,\" while Thatcher inculpated the Soviets as \"bent on world dominance.\" [258] In 1982, Reagan tried to cut off Moscow's access to hard currency by impeding its proposed gas line to Western Europe It hurt the Soviet economy, but it also caused ill will among American allies in Europe who counted on that revenue Reagan retreated on this issue [259] [260]\n\n\nPolish Solidarity movement and martial law\nPope John Paul II provided a moral focus for anti-communism; a visit to his native Poland in 1979 stimulated a religious and nationalist resurgence centered on the Solidarity movement trade union that galvanized opposition and may have led to his attempted assassination two years later [citation needed] In December 1981, Poland's Wojciech Jaruzelski reacted to the crisis by imposing a period of martial law Reagan imposed economic sanctions on Poland in response [263] Mikhail Suslov, the Kremlin's top ideologist, advised Soviet leaders not to intervene if Poland fell under the control of Solidarity, for fear it might lead to heavy economic sanctions, resulting in a catastrophe for the Soviet economy [263]\n\n\nUS and USSR military and economic issues\nThe Soviet Union had built up a military that consumed as much as 25 percent of its gross national product at the expense of consumer goods and investment in civilian sectors [264] Soviet spending on the arms race and other Cold War commitments both caused and exacerbated deep-seated structural problems in the Soviet system, [265] which experienced at least a decade of economic stagnation during the late Brezhnev years.\n\n\nFinal years (1985–1991)\nBy the time the comparatively youthful Mikhail Gorbachev became General Secretary in 1985, [258] the Soviet economy was stagnant and faced a sharp fall in foreign currency earnings as a result of the downward slide in oil prices in the 1980s [292] These issues prompted Gorbachev to investigate measures to revive the ailing state [292]\n\n\nGorbachev's reforms\nBy the time the comparatively youthful Mikhail Gorbachev became General Secretary in 1985, [258] the Soviet economy was stagnant and faced a sharp fall in foreign currency earnings as a result of the downward slide in oil prices in the 1980s [292] These issues prompted Gorbachev to investigate measures to revive the ailing state [292]\n\n\nThaw in relations\nIn response to the Kremlin's military and political concessions, Reagan agreed to renew talks on economic issues and the scaling-back of the arms race [298] The first summit was held in November 1985 in Geneva, Switzerland [298] A second summit was held in October 1986 in Reykjavík, Iceland Talks went well until the focus shifted to Reagan's proposed Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), which Gorbachev wanted to be eliminated Reagan refused [299] The negotiations failed, but the third summit (Washington Summit (1987), 8–10 December 1987) led to a breakthrough with the signing of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) The INF treaty eliminated all nuclear-armed, ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges between 500 and 5,500 kilometers (310 and 3,420 mi) and their infrastructure [300]\n\n\nEastern Europe breaks away\nTwo developments dominated the decade that followed: the increasingly apparent crumbling of the Soviet Union's economic and political structures, and the patchwork attempts at reforms to reverse that process Kenneth S Deffeyes argued in Beyond Oil that the Reagan administration encouraged Saudi Arabia to lower the price of oil to the point where the Soviets could not make a profit selling their oil, and resulted in the depletion of the country's hard currency reserves [308]\n\n\nSoviet dissolution\nAt the same time, the Soviet republics started legal moves towards potentially declaring sovereignty over their territories, citing the freedom to secede in Article 72 of the USSR constitution [316] On 7 April 1990, a law was passed allowing a republic to secede if more than two-thirds of its residents voted for it in a referendum [317] Many held their first free elections in the Soviet era for their own national legislatures in 1990 Many of these legislatures proceeded to produce legislation contradicting the Union laws in what was known as the 'War of Laws' In 1989, the Russian SFSR convened a newly elected Congress of People's Deputies Boris Yeltsin was elected its chairman On 12 June 1990, the Congress declared Russia's sovereignty over its territory and proceeded to pass laws that attempted to supersede some of the Soviet laws After a landslide victory of Sąjūdis in Lithuania, that country declared its independence restored on 11 March 1990, citing the illegality of the Soviet occupation of the Baltic states Soviet forces attempted to halt the secession by crushing popular demonstrations in Lithuania (Bloody Sunday) and Latvia (The Barricades), as a result, numerous civilians were killed or wounded However, these actions only bolstered international support for the secessionists [318]\n\n\nAftermath\nIn summing up the international ramifications of these events, Vladislav Zubok stated: 'The collapse of the Soviet empire was an event of epochal geopolitical, military, ideological, and economic significance.' [323]\n\n\nDecommunization\nStephen Holmes of the University of Chicago argued in 1996 that decommunization, after a brief active period, quickly ended in near-universal failure After the introduction of lustration, demand for scapegoats has become relatively low, and former communists have been elected for high governmental and other administrative positions Holmes notes that the only real exception was former East Germany, where thousands of former Stasi informers have been fired from public positions [329]\n\n\nInfluence\nThe Cold War continues to influence world affairs The post-Cold War world is considered to be unipolar, with the United States the sole remaining superpower [345] [346] The Cold War defined the political role of the United States after World War II—by 1989 the United States had military alliances with 50 countries, with 526,000 troops stationed abroad, [347] with 326,000 in Europe (two-thirds of which were in West Germany) [348] and 130,000 in Asia (mainly Japan and South Korea) [347] The Cold War also marked the zenith of peacetime military–industrial complexes, especially in the Soviet Union and the United States, and large-scale military funding of science [349] These complexes, though their origins may be found as early as the 19th century, snowballed considerably during the Cold War [350]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nDuring the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union invested heavily in propaganda designed to influence people around the world, especially using motion pictures [355] [page needed] The Cold War endures as a popular topic reflected in entertainment media, and continuing to the present with post-1991 Cold War-themed feature films, novels, television and web series, and other media In 2013, a KGB-sleeper-agents-living-next-door action drama series, The Americans, set in the early 1980s, was ranked No 6 on the Metacritic annual Best New TV Shows list; its six-season run concluded in May 2018 [356] [357]\n\n\nHistoriography\nAs soon as the term \"Cold War\" was popularized to refer to post-war tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union, interpreting the course and origins of the conflict has been a source of heated controversy among historians, political scientists, and journalists [358] In particular, historians have sharply disagreed as to who was responsible for the breakdown of Soviet–US relations after the Second World War; and whether the conflict between the two superpowers was inevitable or could have been avoided [359] Historians have also disagreed on what exactly the Cold War was, what the sources of the conflict were, and how to disentangle patterns of action and reaction between the two sides [238]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\n\nNotes and quotes\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\nSources\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nReports\n\n\nJournal articles\n\n\nMagazine articles\n\n\nNews articles\n\n\nWeb\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\nArchives\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nEducational resource\n\n\nNews\n\n\nFilms\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Conspiracy_theories_about_the_death_of_Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "content": "\nHenri Paul\nTheorists have alleged that the driver of the Mercedes-Benz W140, Henri Paul, was in the pay of a national security service, though different versions of the allegation name the country of the security service alternately as Britain, France or the United States Evidence purported to support this arises mainly from money in his possession at the time of his death and his personal wealth These allegations are covered in chapter four of the Operation Paget criminal investigation report Mohamed Al-Fayed claimed that Henri Paul was working for MI6 and that they set him up [18] The inquiry found no evidence Henri Paul was an agent for any security service [19]\n\n\nSecurity service connections\nTheorists have alleged that the driver of the Mercedes-Benz W140, Henri Paul, was in the pay of a national security service, though different versions of the allegation name the country of the security service alternately as Britain, France or the United States Evidence purported to support this arises mainly from money in his possession at the time of his death and his personal wealth These allegations are covered in chapter four of the Operation Paget criminal investigation report Mohamed Al-Fayed claimed that Henri Paul was working for MI6 and that they set him up [18] The inquiry found no evidence Henri Paul was an agent for any security service [19]\n\n\nBlood samples\nAnother allegation concerns the reliability of blood tests carried out, which indicated Paul had been drinking before he took the controls of the car The French investigators' conclusion that Paul was drunk was made on the basis of an analysis of blood samples, which were said to contain an alcohol level that was more than three times the French legal limit This initial analysis was challenged by a British pathologist hired by Al-Fayed In response, French authorities carried out a third test, this time using the more medically conclusive vitreous fluid from inside the eye, which confirmed the level of alcohol measured by blood and also showed Paul had been taking antidepressants [20]\n\n\nTomlinson's allegation of MI6 involvement\nRichard Tomlinson, a former MI6 officer who was dismissed from the intelligence services and later served five months in prison for breaching the Official Secrets Act 1989, [33] claimed in a sworn statement to the French inquiry in May 1999 that Britain's MI6 had been involved in the crash, suggesting that the security service had documentation which would assist Judge Stephan in his inquiry [34] The previous August, he had been reported by the BBC to have claimed that Paul was working for the security services and that one of Diana's bodyguards, either Trevor Rees-Jones (now known as Trevor Rees) or Kes Wingfield, was a contact for British intelligence [35] Tomlinson alleged that MI6 was monitoring Diana before her death, had told Mohamed Al-Fayed that Paul was an MI6 agent, [36] and that her death mirrored plans he saw in 1992 for the assassination of then President of Serbia Slobodan Milošević, using a strobe light to blind his chauffeur [37]\n\n\nRelationship with Dodi Fayed\nOne of the main motives which has been advanced for alleged murder includes suggestions Diana was pregnant with Mohamed \"Dodi\" Fayed's child and the couple were about to get engaged The alleged dislike of the idea of a non-Christian within the British royal family meant such a relationship between the mother of the future king and an Egyptian Muslim would not be tolerated [44] In Mohamed Al-Fayed's view, which he repeated in court at the inquest in February 2008, Prince Philip, Prince Charles (the future King Charles III), Diana's sister Lady Sarah McCorquodale and numerous others were all involved in a plot to kill the Princess and his son [45] Jeffrey Steinberg of the Executive Intelligence Review (EIR), a publication of the American Lyndon LaRouche movement, has also put forward theories that the Princess of Wales was murdered by the security services under the instructions of Prince Philip [46] An article in The Daily Telegraph in 1998 reporting the EIR conspiracy theories alleged earlier links between the EIR and Al-Fayed, [47] while Francis Wheen reported the following year that Al-Fayed's spokesman had advised journalists to contact Steinberg [48]\n\n\nPregnancy\nIn January 2004, the former coroner of the Queen's Household, John Burton, said (in an interview with The Times) that he attended a post-mortem examination of the Princess's body at Fulham mortuary, where he personally examined her womb and found her not to be pregnant [55] [61] Robert Chapman, who carried out the post-mortem examination, stated that Diana's womb and ovaries showed no sign of pregnancy [62]\n\n\nAbsence of CCTV images\nThe absence of CCTV images showing the Mercedes's journey from the hotel to the crash site has been frequently cited as evidence of an organised conspiracy According to The Independent newspaper in 2006, there were more than 14 CCTV cameras in the Pont de l'Alma underpass, though none recorded footage of the fatal collision [70]\n\n\nWhite Fiat Uno and James Andanson\nAnalysis of the wreckage of the Mercedes revealed it had glancing contact with a white Fiat Uno car which left traces of paint on the Mercedes bodywork Extensive attempts by the French police to find the vehicle involved were unsuccessful [72] Although no one had seen the Fiat in the tunnel, some witnesses reported seeing an Uno exiting the tunnel [73]\n\n\nAndanson's suicide\nAndanson died in May 2000 The official verdict was suicide [79] His body was found in a black, burnt-out BMW in a forest near the town of Nant, near Millau, in Southern France Andanson's death was attributed to problems in his private life The 2008 inquest into the death of the Princess of Wales heard that evidence was uncovered from his friends and associates that prior to his death he had talked of suicide by pouring petrol in a car and lighting a cigar, as noted by Richard Horwell QC, for the Metropolitan Commissioner [80]\n\n\nLe Van Thanh\nIt has been reported by numerous publications that the white Fiat Uno belonged to Le Van Thanh, a taxi driver who was 22 years old at the time of the crash Multiple witnesses recall seeing a man matching his description exit the tunnel seconds after the crash [7] Georges and Sabine Dauzonne identified Thanh as \"the agitated man they may have seen driving the car\" [83] [84]\n\n\nBright flash\nAn alternative explanation for the cause of the crash has been reports of a bright white flash just before the car entered the tunnel, blinding the driver Richard Tomlinson made this allegation at the inquiry, but the veracity of his evidence was found wanting.\n\n\nSeat belt\nThere was some media discussion in April 2006 suggesting that Diana was a faithful seat belt user and therefore the fact that both her and Dodi's seat belts either failed or were not used was sinister and might suggest sabotage [96] Her sister, Lady Sarah McCorquodale later said that Diana

emergency services' switchboard was logged at 12:26 a.m The SAMU ambulance carrying the Princess arrived at the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital at 2:06 a.m The French system of emergency care adhered to the \"stay and play\" mantra, which meant that the patient needed to be stabilised first at a fully equipped medical ambulance before being directed to a specialised hospital that could treat his or her injuries, no matter how far away it was [102] Nevertheless, this length of time has prompted much conspiracy-related comment.\n\n\nEmbalming of the body\nMohamed Al-Fayed alleged that Diana's body was deliberately embalmed shortly after her death to ensure that any pregnancy test at the post-mortem would produce a false result Robert Chapman, who carried out the post-mortem examination, stated that the embalming fluids would have had no effect on determining whether Diana was pregnant or not as the physical evidence would have been present in her womb and ovaries [62]\n\n\nSAS\nThe Court Martial of SAS Sniper Danny Nightingale led to a letter written by witness, Soldier N, and sent to his in-laws coming to wider attention Soldier N, Nightingale's former roommate, was in prison for illegally hiding firearms and ammunition On 17 August 2013, the Metropolitan Police announced they were reviewing evidence that Soldier N had boasted that the SAS were behind the death of Princess Diana [108] The parents of Soldier N's estranged wife reportedly wrote to the SAS's commanding officer, claiming Soldier N had told his wife the unit \"arranged\" Diana's death and it was \"covered up\" [109] [110] The information was reportedly passed onto Scotland Yard by the Royal Military Police However, Scotland Yard stressed that this information would not lead to a re-investigation and that they were examining its \"relevance and credibility\" [111] They also confirmed that Prince Charles and Mohamed Al-Fayed were being kept informed as preliminary examination progressed At the end of November 2013, Scotland Yard ended its study of the SAS allegations and released a statement: \"The Metropolitan Police Service has scoped the information and is in the process of drawing up conclusions, which will be communicated to the families and interested parties first, before any further comment can be made,\" [112] On 16 December, it emerged from Sky News reports that there was \"no credible evidence\" that the SAS was involved in the death of the Princess and the others, and thus no reason to re-open the investigation [113] [114]\n\n\nPopular culture\n\n\nSee also\n\n",

partner, and the driver, Henri Paul. The investigation into the accident concluded that Paul lost control of the car while driving at a high speed in the Alma Tunnel, resulting in a fatal collision with a concrete pillar. However, various conspiracy theories have emerged over the years, suggesting that the accident was not an accident at all, but rather a deliberate act of murder orchestrated by various individuals or organizations.\n\n# Henri Paul\n\nTheorists have alleged that the driver of the Mercedes-Benz W140, Henri Paul, was in the pay of a national security service, though different versions of the allegation name the country of the security service alternately as Britain, France or the United States. Evidence purported to support this arises mainly from money in his possession at the time of his death and his personal wealth. These allegations are covered in chapter four of the Operation Paget criminal investigation report. Mohamed Al-Fayed claimed that Henri Paul was working for MI6 and that they set him up. The inquiry found no evidence Henri Paul was an agent for any security service.\n\n# Security Service Connections\n\nTheorists have alleged that the driver of the Mercedes-Benz W140, Henri Paul, was in the pay of a national security service, though different versions of the allegation name the country of the security service alternately as Britain, France or the United States. Evidence purported to support this arises mainly from money in his possession at the time of his death and his personal wealth. These allegations are covered in chapter four of the Operation Paget criminal investigation report. Mohamed Al-Fayed claimed that Henri Paul was working for MI6 and that they set him up. The inquiry found no evidence Henri Paul was an agent for any security service.\n\n# Blood Samples\n\nAnother allegation concerns the reliability of blood tests carried out, which indicated Paul had been drinking before he took the controls of the car. The French investigators' conclusion that Paul was drunk was made on the basis of an analysis of blood samples, which were said to contain an alcohol level that was more than three times the French legal limit. This initial analysis was challenged by a British pathologist hired by Al-Fayed. In response, French authorities carried out a third test, this time using the more medically conclusive vitreous fluid from inside the eye, which confirmed the level of alcohol measured by blood and also showed Paul had been taking antidepressants.\n\n# Tomlinson's Allegation of MI6 Involvement\n\nRichard Tomlinson, a former MI6 officer who was dismissed from the intelligence services and later served five months in prison for breaching the Official Secrets Act 1989, claimed in a sworn statement to the French inquiry in May 1999 that Britain's MI6 had been involved in the crash, suggesting that the security service had documentation which would assist Judge Stephan in his inquiry. The previous August, he had been reported by the BBC to have claimed that Paul was working for the security services and that one of Diana's bodyguards, either Trevor Rees-Jones (now known as Trevor Rees) or Kes Wingfield, was a contact for British intelligence. Tomlinson alleged that MI6 was monitoring Diana before her death, had told Mohamed Al-Fayed that Paul was an MI6 agent, and that her death mirrored plans he saw in 1992 for the assassination of then President of Serbia Slobodan Milošević, using a strobe light to blind his chauffeur.\n\n# Relationship with Dodi Fayed\n\nOne of the main motives which has been advanced for alleged murder includes suggestions Diana was pregnant with Mohamed \"Dodi\" Fayed's child and the couple were about to get engaged. The alleged dislike of the idea of a non-Christian within the British royal family meant such a relationship between the mother of the future king and an Egyptian Muslim would not be tolerated. In Mohamed Al-Fayed's view, which he repeated in court at the inquest in February 2008, Prince Philip, Prince Charles (the future King Charles III), Diana's sister Lady Sarah McCorquodale and numerous others were all involved in a plot to kill the Princess and his son. Jeffrey Steinberg of the Executive Intelligence Review (EIR), a publication of the American Lyndon LaRouche movement, has also put forward theories that the Princess of Wales was murdered by the security services under the instructions of Prince Philip.

Francis Wheen reported the following year that Al-Fayed's spokesman had advised journalists to contact Steinberg [48]\n\n\nPregnancy\nIn January 2004, the former coroner of the Queen's Household, John Burton, said (in an interview with The Times) that he attended a post-mortem examination of the Princess's body at Fulham mortuary, where he personally examined her womb and found her not to be pregnant [55] [61] Robert Chapman, who carried out the post-mortem examination, stated that Diana's womb and ovaries showed no sign of pregnancy [62]\n\n\nAbsence of CCTV images\nThe absence of CCTV images showing the Mercedes's journey from the hotel to the crash site has been frequently cited as evidence of an organised conspiracy According to The Independent newspaper in 2006, there were more than 14 CCTV cameras in the Pont de l'Alma underpass, though none recorded footage of the fatal collision [70]\n\n\nWhite Fiat Uno and James Andanson\nAnalysis of the wreckage of the Mercedes revealed it had glancing contact with a white Fiat Uno car which left traces of paint on the Mercedes bodywork Extensive attempts by the French police to find the vehicle involved were unsuccessful [72] Although no one had seen the Fiat in the tunnel, some witnesses reported seeing an Uno exiting the tunnel [73]\n\n\nAndanson's suicide\nAndanson died in May 2000 The official verdict was suicide [79] His body was found in a black, burnt-out BMW in a forest near the town of Nant, near Millau, in Southern France Andanson's death was attributed to problems in his private life The 2008 inquest into the death of the Princess of Wales heard that evidence was uncovered from his friends and associates that prior to his death he had talked of suicide by pouring petrol in a car and lighting a cigar, as noted by Richard Horwell QC, for the Metropolitan Commissioner [80]\n\n\nLe Van Thanh\nIt has been reported by numerous publications that the white Fiat Uno belonged to Le Van Thanh, a taxi driver who was 22 years old at the time of the crash Multiple witnesses recall seeing a man matching his description exit the tunnel seconds after the crash [7] Georges and Sabine Dauzonne identified Thanh as \"the agitated man they may have seen driving the car\" [83] [84]\n\n\nBright flash\nAn alternative explanation for the cause of the crash has been reports of a bright white flash just before the car entered the tunnel, blinding the driver Richard Tomlinson made this allegation at the inquiry, but the veracity of his evidence was found wanting.\n\n\nSeat belt\nThere was some media discussion in April 2006 suggesting that Diana was a faithful seat belt user and therefore the fact that both her and Dodi's seat belts either failed or were not used was sinister and might suggest sabotage [96] Her sister, Lady Sarah McCorquodale later said that Diana \"was religious in putting on her seat belt\" [97] Other sources question if she did in fact use her seat belt all the time, as was suggested [96]\n\n\nTransport to the hospital\nThe first call to the emergency services' switchboard was logged at 12:26 a.m The SAMU ambulance carrying the Princess arrived at the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital at

He rose to prominence in the late 2010s, known for his aggressive fighting style and relentless competition schedule. Colón's career has been marked by both impressive victories and a significant setback due to a brain injury suffered during a fight.\n\n**Early years and amateur career**\n\nColón was born to Richard and Nieves Colón, a retired waitress. His father, a native of Puerto Rico, decided to move to the island when Colón was 10 years old, so he could represent the island in competitions. Colón moved to Puerto Rico with his younger sister, while his mother and older brother remained in Florida. The family settled in the rural town of Orocovis, Puerto Rico.\n\nColón's early life on the island exposed him to the rich cultural heritage and sporting traditions of Puerto Rico. He began training in boxing at a young age, motivated by his father's passion for the sport. Colón's early amateur career was marked by numerous regional and national competitions, where he honed his skills and developed his fighting style.\n\n**Professional career**\n\nColón made his professional debut on February 23, 2013, at the Cosme Beitía Salamo Coliseum in Cataño, Puerto Rico. His first fight was against Xavier La Salle, which Colón won by knockout in the first round. This victory marked the beginning of a successful professional career, with Colón distinguishing himself for his relentless schedule and aggressive fighting style.\n\nThroughout 2013 and 2014, Colón fought five and seven times, respectively, against a variety of opponents. His most notable fight came on September 9, 2015, when he faced Vivian Harris, a more experienced fighter, at the Ricoh Coliseum in Toronto. Colón knocked out Harris in the fourth round, showcasing his skills and potential as a professional boxer.\n\n**Brain injury**\n\nOn April 21, 2017, Colón fought against Williams in a highly anticipated bout.

Colón repeatedly informed the referee, Joe Cooper, about the illegal punches, but Cooper dismissed his pleas, telling him, \"You take care of it.\"\n\nColón hit Williams with a low blow, for which he was penalized two points. Despite the controversy, the fight continued, with Colón being knocked down for the first time in his professional career during the ninth round. Colón spoke to the ringside doctor between the rounds, stating he felt dizzy but felt he could continue. However, after multiple illegal blows, Colón's corner mistakenly removed his gloves, thinking it was the end of the fight. As a result, Colón was disqualified.\n\nThe aftermath of the fight saw Colón assisted to the dressing room by his mother, where he vomited and collapsed. He was then taken to hospital via ambulance and diagnosed with a left-sided subdural hematoma measuring 1.5 cm in diameter with 1.2 cm of midline shift. An emergency hemicraniectomy was performed to reduce brain swelling and evacuate the hematoma, resulting in Colón going into a coma for 221 days.\n\n**Professional boxing record**\n\nColón's professional boxing record is still active, with 22 wins, 3 losses, and 1 draw.

{"title": "Saint_Patrick's_Day", "content": "\nSaint Patrick\nSaint Patrick was a 5th-century Romano-British Christian missionary and Bishop in Ireland Much of what is known about Saint Patrick comes from the Declaration, which was allegedly written by Patrick himself It is believed that he was born in Roman Britain in the fourth century, into a wealthy Romano-British family His father was a deacon and his grandfather was a priest in the Christian church According to the Declaration, at the age of sixteen, he was kidnapped by Irish raiders and taken as a slave to Gaelic Ireland [19] It says that he spent six years there working as a shepherd and that during this time he found God The Declaration says that God told Patrick to flee to the coast, where a ship would be waiting to take him home After making his way home, Patrick went on to become a priest [20]\n\n\nCelebration and traditions\nPresent day Saint Patrick's Day celebrations have been greatly influenced by those that developed among the Irish diaspora, especially in North America Until the late 20th century, Saint Patrick's Day was often a bigger celebration among the diaspora than it was in Ireland [17]\n\n\nWearing green and shamrocks\nOn Saint Patrick's Day, it is customary to wear shamrocks, green clothing or green accessories Saint Patrick is said to have used the shamrock, a three-leaved plant, to explain the Holy Trinity to the pagan Irish [34] [35] This story first appears in writing in 1726, though it may be older In pagan Ireland, three was a significant number and the Irish had many triple deities, which may have aided St Patrick in his evangelisation efforts [36] [37] Roger Homan writes, \"We can perhaps see St Patrick drawing upon the visual concept of the triskele when he uses the shamrock to explain the Trinity\" [38] Patricia Monaghan says there is no evidence the shamrock was sacred to the pagan Irish [36] Jack Santino speculates that it may have represented the regenerative powers of nature, and was recast in a Christian context‍—‌icons of Saint Patrick often depict the saint \"with a cross in one hand and a sprig of shamrocks in the other\" [39]\n\n\nIreland\nSaint Patrick's feast day, as a kind of national day, was already being celebrated by the Irish in Europe in the ninth and tenth centuries [58] Saint Patrick's feast day was finally placed on the liturgical calendar of the Catholic Church in the early 1600s, due to the influence of Waterford-born Franciscan scholar Luke Wadding [59] Saint Patrick's Day thus became a holy day of obligation for Catholics in Ireland It is also a feast day in the Church of Ireland, part of the Anglican Communion The church calendar avoids the observance of saints' feasts during certain solemnities, moving the saint's day to a time outside those periods Saint Patrick's Day is occasionally affected by this requirement, when 17 March falls during Holy Week This happened in 1940, when Saint Patrick's Day was officially observed on 3 April to avoid it coinciding with Palm Sunday, and again in 2008, where it was officially observed on 15 March [60] Saint Patrick's Day will not fall within Holy Week again until 2160 [61] [62] However, the popular festivities may still be held on 17 March or on a weekend near to the feast day [63]\n\n\nHistory\nSaint Patrick's feast day, as a kind

Cambridge has presented the bowls of shamrock to the Irish Guards While female royals are often tasked with presenting the bowls of shamrock, male royals have also undertaken the role, such as King George VI in 1950 to mark the 50th anniversary of the formation of the Irish Guards, and in 2016 the Duke of Cambridge in place of his wife [97] [98] Fresh Shamrocks are presented to the Irish Guards,

commemorate the patron saint of Ireland, Saint Patrick. The day has become a global phenomenon, with celebrations taking place in over 100 countries. The holiday has a rich history and has evolved over time, influenced by various cultures and traditions.\n\n**History**\n\nSaint Patrick is believed to have been born in Roman Britain in the fourth century. At the age of 16, he was kidnapped by Irish raiders and taken as a slave to Gaelic Ireland. During his six-year enslavement, Patrick found God and became deeply devoted to his faith. After escaping, he returned to Ireland as a missionary and spent the rest of his life spreading Christianity to the Irish people.\n\n**Celebration and Traditions**\n\nPresent day Saint Patrick's Day celebrations have been greatly influenced by those that developed among the Irish diaspora, especially in North America. Until the late 20th century, Saint Patrick's Day was often a bigger celebration among the diaspora than it was in Ireland. The day is traditionally marked by the wearing of green clothing or accessories, as well as the consumption of Irish food and drink.\n\n**Wearing Green and Shamrocks**\n\nOn Saint Patrick's Day, it is customary to wear shamrocks, green clothing or green accessories. Saint Patrick is said to have used the shamrock, a three-leaved plant, to explain the Holy Trinity to the pagan Irish. This story first appears in writing in 1726, though it may be older. The use of the shamrock as a symbol of Saint Patrick's Day is a reference to the story of how he used the plant to explain the concept of the Trinity to the Irish people.\n\n**Ireland**\n\nSaint Patrick's feast day, as a kind of national day, was already being celebrated by the Irish in Europe in the ninth and tenth centuries. Saint Patrick's feast day was finally placed on the liturgical calendar of the Catholic Church in the early 1600s, due to the influence of Waterford-born Franciscan scholar Luke Wadding. Saint Patrick's Day thus became a holy day of obligation for Catholics in Ireland. It is also a feast day in the Church of Ireland, part of the Anglican Communion.\n\n**Modern Era**\n\nIn 1903, Saint Patrick's Day became an official public holiday in Ireland due to the Bank Holiday (Ireland) Act 1903, an act of the United Kingdom parliament introduced by Irish MP James O'Mara.\n\n**Celebrations Elsewhere**\n\nIn England, the Royal Colonel or Colonel-in-chief traditionally present bowls of shamrock to members of the Irish Guards, a regiment in the British Army, following Queen Alexandra introducing the tradition in 1901. Since 2012, the Duchess of Cambridge has presented the bowls of shamrock to the Irish Guards.

Much of what is known about Saint Patrick comes from the Declaration, which was allegedly written by Patrick himself It is believed that he was born in Roman Britain in the fourth century, into a wealthy Romano-British family His father was a deacon and his grandfather was a priest in the Christian church According to the Declaration, at the age of sixteen, he was kidnapped by Irish raiders and taken as a slave to Gaelic Ireland [19] It says that he spent six years there working as a shepherd and that during this time he found God The Declaration says that God told Patrick to flee to the

significant number and the Irish had many triple deities, which may have aided St Patrick in his evangelisation efforts [36] [37] Roger Homan writes, \"We can perhaps see St Patrick drawing upon the visual concept of the triskele when he uses the shamrock to explain the Trinity\" [38] Patricia Monaghan says there is no evidence the shamrock was sacred to the pagan Irish [36] Jack Santino speculates that it may have represented the regenerative powers of nature, and was recast in a Christian context‍—‌icons of Saint Patrick often depict the saint \"with a cross in one hand and a sprig

which was cancelled at the outbreak of World War II and wasn't revived until 1990, [162] was not called off in 2020 as precaution for the COVID-19 pandemic, in contrast to many other Saint Patrick's Day parades around the world [163]\n\n\nNew Zealand\nFrom 1878 to 1955, Saint Patrick's Day was recognised as a public holiday in New Zealand, together with St George's Day (England) and St Andrew's Day (Scotland) [174] [175] [176] Auckland attracted many Irish migrants in the 1850s and 1860s, and it was here where some of the earliest Saint Patrick's Day celebrations took place, which often entailed the hosting of community picnics [177] However, this rapidly evolved from the late 1860s onwards to include holding parades with pipe bands and marching children wearing green, sporting events, concerts, balls and other social events, where people displayed their Irishness with pride [177] While Saint Patrick's Day is no longer recognised as a public holiday, it continues to be celebrated across New Zealand with festivals and parades at weekends on or around 17 March [178] [179]\n\n\nAsia\nSaint Patrick's parades are now held in many locations across Japan [180] The first parade, in Tokyo, was organised by The Irish Network Japan (INJ) in 1992.\n\n\nUN Peacekeeping Missions\nIrish United Nations (UN) peacekeepers also celebrating Saint Patrick's Day outside Ireland during their participation in UN peacekeeping missions in conflict-raged countries [182]\n\n\nInternational Space Station\nAstronauts on board the International Space Station have celebrated the festival in different ways Irish-American Catherine Coleman played a hundred-year-old flute belonging to Matt Molloy and a tin whistle belonging to Paddy Moloney, both members of the Irish music group The Chieftains, while floating weightless in the space station on Saint Patrick's Day in 2011 [183] [184] [185] Her performance was later included in a track called \"The Chieftains in Orbit\" on the group's 2012 album, Voice of Ages [186]\n\n\nCriticism\nSaint Patrick's Day celebrations have been criticised, particularly for their association with public drunkenness and disorderly conduct Some argue that the festivities have become too commercialised and tacky, [189] [190] and have strayed from their original purpose of honouring Saint Patrick and Irish heritage [191] [192] [189] Irish American journalist Niall O'Dowd has criticised attempts to recast Saint Patrick's Day as a celebration of multiculturalism rather than a celebration of Irishness [193]\n\n\nSports events\n(federal) =

Bohemian actress, known for her performances on the stages of Prague and Berlin during the late 19th century. Born in Karlín, a working-class suburb of Prague, Pospischil began her career as a young actress, quickly making a name for herself as a versatile and talented performer.\n\n**Early Life and Career**\n\nPospischil was born into a family with two sisters, although not much is known about their lives. One sister became an actress, while the other got married and lived in Mladá Boleslav. Pospischil's early life and training as an actress are not well-documented, but it is known that she began performing on the stages of Prague's National Theatre and František Pokorný Theatre Company, a Bohemian touring company.\n\n**Conflict with the National Theatre Director**\n\nAccording to various accounts, Pospischil was a stubborn and self-centered actress who often had the impression that she was entitled to more significant roles. The dramaturge of the theatre, Ladislav Stroupežnický, noted about Pospischil: \"Mercury, passion, spoiled child.\" This perception of her personality and behavior likely contributed to her conflicts with the theatre's director and other colleagues.\n\n**Polish Tour and Prague German Theatre**\n\nIn 1885, Pospischil appeared as a guest star on Polish stages, a move that likely suggested by writer and journalist František Hovorka, who was well-acquainted with Polish culture life. She was unemployed at the time and saw this opportunity as a chance to gain experience and recognition. After her Polish tour, Pospischil returned to Prague and began performing at the Prague German Theatre, a move that would later lead to her becoming a prominent figure in the German-speaking theatre scene in Berlin.\n\n**Berlin and Vienna**\n\nIn 1887, Pospischil was invited to perform at the Deutsches Theater in Berlin, where she became a member of the ensemble and performed in various roles, including the title role of Donna Diana by Agustín Moreto y Cavana. Her performances in Berlin were highly praised, and she became known for her portrayals of tragic heroines, including Adelheid von Walldorf in Goethe's Götz von Berlichingen and Lady Milford in Schiller's Intrigue and Love. Pospischil's time in Vienna was marked by a rivalry with the renowned actress Charlotte Wolter, who overshadowed her in the eyes of the theatre's director and audiences.\n\n**Fight with Wolter**\n\nPospischil's rivalry with Wolter was a subject of discussion among theatre enthusiasts and critics, with many seeing it as a clash between two strong-willed and talented actresses. While Pospischil felt that she was not being given the recognition she deserved, Wolter was a established star who had a long history of success in Vienna. The conflict between the two actresses continued for several years, with Pospischil eventually leaving Vienna and returning to Berlin.\n\n**Alongside Ludwig Barnay**\n\nIn 1893, Pospischil left Vienna and returned to Berlin, where she obtained an engagement at the Berliner Theater under the artistic guidance of Ludwig Barnay. Here, she began to move from the roles of young naive lovers to the genre of mature tragic heroines, including Lady Milfort in Schiller's Intrigue and Love and Grillparzer's Sappho. Pospischil's performances in Berlin were highly praised, and she became known for her ability to portray complex and nuanced characters.\n\n**Return to Prague and Media Outburst Against Pospischil**\n\nIn the spring of 1895, Pospischil attempted to return to the Czech stage, a move that was met with a media outburst against her. Many critics and theatre enthusiasts saw her return as a betrayal of her German career and a sign of her decline as an actress. The situation was further complicated by a series of student demonstrations and riots that took place at the National Theatre, where Pospischil was scheduled to perform.\n\n**National Theatre Riots**\n\nPospischil's first public appearance in Prague was threatened by student demonstrations, and she was eventually escorted by police upon entering and leaving the theatre. When she appeared on stage, a group of hired protesters rioted in the auditorium, shouting and whistling to prevent the actress from performing. The incident was widely reported in the press and sparked a heated debate about the role of women in the theatre and the treatment of actresses.\n\n**National Theatre Contract**\n\nAfter the riots, Pospischil decided to go back to Germany, but during the tour, she started negotiating a contract with Růžička Šubert, a theatre owner. However, the contract negotiations were complicated by Šubert's reluctance to work with Pospischil, and the incident ultimately led to her leaving Prague for good.\n\n**Berlin and Hamburg**\n\nAfter her unsuccessful attempt to return to Bohemia, Pospischil decided to return to Germany and opened the season with a controversial role of the wild and passionate Amazon queen Heinrich von Kleist's Penthesilea. She also reprised her showcase roles of Schiller's Maria Stuart and Goethe's Adelheid von Waldorf.\n\n**Later Career**\n\nBetween 1909 and 1913, Pospischil was the first director of the German theatre in Ústí nad Labem, a move that marked a new chapter in her career. She reprised the title role of Franz Grillparzer's Sappho and later guest-starred in local theatres, including Magda in Teplice and Duchess of Marlborough in Litoměřice. Pospischil's commitment to the installation of a commemorative plaque to Richard Wagner in the ruins of nearby Střekov Castle, which had inspired the composer when writing his opera Tannhäuser, is also notable.\n\n**Pospischil's Writing**\n\nPospischil was also active as a writer, frequently answering German theatre newspaper inquiries. In 1895, she answered the Kussproblem enquiry, a debate about how real a kiss should be on stage. Pospischil's response, which advocated for the use of real kisses on stage, was seen as risqué at the time. She also published a memory of her stage mother, a tribute to forgotten touring actresses, in both German and Czech.\n\n**Acting Style**\n\nPospischil's acting style was characterized by her ability to portray complex and nuanced characters, often in grand, classical roles. Her performance style was described by playwright Paul Lindau as \"a heroine with the appearance of a salon lover and the voice of a sentimentalist, and her character is welded together by the passion of feeling.\" Pospischil's acting was widely praised, and she was often compared to the greatest actresses of her time, including Sarah Bernhardt, Eleonora Duse, and Helena Modjeska.\n\n**Roles Played by Maria Pospischil**\n\nPospischil's repertoire included a wide range of roles, from classical tragic heroines to comedic characters.

As a member of the renowned Redgrave family, Richardson was born into a theatrical dynasty, which played a significant role in shaping her career.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nNatasha Jane Richardson was born on 11 May 1963, in Marylebone, London. She was the daughter of director and producer Tony Richardson and actress Vanessa Redgrave.

{"title": "Freemasonry", "content": "\nMasonic lodge\nThe Masonic lodge is the basic organisational unit of Freemasonry [12] The Lodge meets regularly and conducts the usual formal business of any small organisation (approve minutes, elect new members, appoint officers and take their reports, consider correspondence, bills and annual accounts, organise social and charitable events, etc.) In addition to such business, the meeting may perform a ceremony to confer a Masonic degree [13] or receive a lecture, which is usually on some aspect of Masonic history or ritual [14] At the conclusion of the meeting, the Lodge may hold a formal dinner, or festive board, sometimes involving toasting and song [15]\n\n\nJoining a lodge\nCandidates for Freemasonry will usually have met the most active members of the Lodge they are joining before being elected for initiation The process varies among Grand Lodges, but in modern times interested people often look up a local Lodge through the Internet and will typically be introduced to a Lodge social function or open evening The onus is upon candidates to ask to join; while they may be encouraged to ask, they may not be invited Once the initial inquiry is made, a formal application may be proposed and seconded or announced in open Lodge and a more or less formal interview usually follows If the candidate wishes to proceed, references are taken up during a period of notice so that members may enquire into the candidate's suitability and discuss it Finally, the Lodge takes an officially secret ballot on each application before a candidate is either initiated or rejected [27] The exact number of adverse ballots (\"blackballs\") required to reject a candidate varies between Masonic jurisdictions As an example, the United Grand Lodge of England only requires a single \"blackball\", while the Grand Lodge of New York requires three.\n\n\nOrganisation\nGrand Lodges and Grand Orients are independent and sovereign bodies that govern Masonry in a given country, state or geographical area (termed a jurisdiction) There is no single overarching governing body that presides over worldwide Freemasonry; connections between different jurisdictions depend solely on mutual recognition [34] [35]\n\n\nGrand Lodges\nGrand Lodges and Grand Orients are independent and sovereign bodies that govern Masonry in a given country, state or geographical area (termed a jurisdiction) There is no single overarching governing body that presides over worldwide Freemasonry; connections between different jurisdictions depend solely on mutual recognition [34] [35]\n\n\nRecognition, amity and regularity\nRelations between Grand Lodges are determined by the concept of Recognition Each Grand Lodge maintains a list of other Grand Lodges that it recognises [44] When two Grand Lodges recognise and are in Masonic communication with each other, they are said to be in amity, and the brethren of each may visit each other's Lodges and interact Masonically When two Grand Lodges are not in amity, inter-visitation is not allowed There are many reasons one Grand Lodge will withhold or withdraw recognition from another, but the two most common are Exclusive Jurisdiction and Regularity [45]\n\n\nExclusive Jurisdiction\nExclusive Jurisdiction is a concept whereby normally only one Grand Lodge will be recognised in any geographical area If two Grand Lodges claim jurisdiction over the same area, the other Grand Lodges will have to choose between them, and they may not all decide to recognise the same one (In 1849, for example, the Grand Lodge of New York split into two rival factions, each claiming to be the legitimate Grand Lodge Other Grand Lodges had to choose between them until the schism was healed [46]) Exclusive Jurisdiction can be waived when the two overlapping Grand Lodges are themselves in amity and agree to share jurisdiction For example, since the Grand Lodge of Connecticut is in amity with the Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Connecticut, the principle of Exclusive Jurisdiction does not apply, and other Grand Lodges may recognise both [47] Likewise, the five distinct kinds of lodges in Germany have nominally united under one Grand Lodge in order to obtain international recognition.\n\n\nModern Challenges and Evolution\nThe concept of Exclusive Jurisdiction has been significantly challenged in the United States with the increasing recognition of Prince Hall Grand Lodges, a branch of Freemasonry created for African Americans Historically, many \"mainstream\" or conservative U.S Grand Lodges refused to recognize Prince Hall Grand Lodges operating in their states, citing Exclusive Jurisdiction However, this began to change in 1989 when the Grand Lodge of Connecticut extended recognition to its Prince Hall counterpart [48] [49]\n\n\nRegularity\nRegularity is a concept based on adherence to Masonic Landmarks, the basic membership requirements, tenets and rituals of the craft Each Grand Lodge sets its own definition of what these landmarks are, and thus what is Regular and what is Irregular (and the definitions do not necessarily agree between Grand Lodges) Essentially, every Grand Lodge will hold that its landmarks (its requirements, tenets and rituals) are Regular, and judge other Grand Lodges based on those If the differences are significant, one Grand Lodge may declare the other \"Irregular\" and withdraw or withhold recognition [53] [54]\n\n\nOther degrees, orders, and bodies\nBlue Lodges, known as Craft Lodges in the United Kingdom, offer only the three traditional degrees In most jurisdictions, the rank of past or installed master is also conferred in Blue/Craft Lodges Master Masons are able to extend their Masonic experience by taking further degrees, in appendant or other bodies whether or not approved by their own Grand Lodge [56]\n\n\nRitual and symbolism\nFreemasonry describes itself as a \"beautiful system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols\" [60] The symbolism is mainly, but not exclusively, drawn from the tools of stonemasons – the square and compasses, the level and plumb rule, the trowel, the rough and smooth ashlars, among others Moral lessons are attributed to each of these tools, although the assignment is by no means consistent The meaning of the symbolism is taught and explored through ritual, [24] and in lectures and articles by individual Masons who offer their personal insights and opinions.\n\n\nHistory\nSince the middle of the 19th century, Masonic historians have sought the origins of the movement in a series of similar documents known as the Old Charges, dating from the Regius Poem in about 1425 [65] to the beginning of the 18th century Alluding to the membership of a lodge of operative masons, they relate it to a mythologised history of the craft, the duties of its grades, and the manner in which oaths of fidelity are to be taken on joining [66] The 15th century also sees the first evidence of ceremonial regalia [67]\n\n\nOrigins\nSince the middle of the 19th century, Masonic historians have sought the origins of the movement in a series of similar documents known as

of the craft, the duties of its grades, and the manner in which oaths of fidelity are to be taken on joining [66] The 15th century also sees the first evidence of ceremonial regalia [67]\n\n\nNorth America\nThe earliest known American lodges were in Pennsylvania The collector for the port of Pennsylvania, John Moore, wrote of attending lodges there in 1715, two years before the putative formation of the first Grand Lodge in London The Grand Lodge of England appointed a Provincial Grand Master for North America in 1731, based in Pennsylvania, [81] leading to the creation of the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania.\n\n\nJamaican Freemasonry\nFreemasonry was imported to Jamaica by British immigrants who colonized the island for over 300 years In 1908, there were eleven recorded Masonic lodges, which included three Grand Lodges, two Craft lodges, and two Rose Croix chapters [91] During slavery, the lodges were open to all \"freeborn\" men According to the Jamaican 1834 census, that potentially included 5,000 free black men and 40,000 free people of colour (mixed race) [92] After the full abolition of slavery in 1838, the Lodges were open to all Jamaican men of any race [93] Jamaica also kept close relationships with Masons from other countries Jamaican Freemasonry historian Jackie Ranston, noted that:\n\n\nPrince Hall Freemasonry\nPrince Hall Freemasonry exists because of the refusal of early American lodges to admit African Americans In 1775, an African American named Prince Hall, [95] along with 14 other African American men, was initiated into a British military lodge with a warrant from the Grand Lodge of Ireland, having failed to obtain admission from the other lodges in Boston When the British military Lodge left North America after the end of the Revolution, those 15 men were given the authority to meet as a Lodge, but not to initiate Masons In 1784, these individuals obtained a Warrant from the Grand Lodge of England (Premiere Grand Lodge) and formed African Lodge, Number 459 When the two English grand lodges united in 1813, all U.S.-based Lodges were stricken from their rolls – largely because of the War of 1812 Thus, separated from both English jurisdiction and any concordantly recognised U.S Grand Lodge, African Lodge retitled itself as the African Lodge, Number 1 – and became a de facto Grand Lodge (This lodge is not to be confused with the various Grand Lodges in Africa.) As with the rest of U.S Freemasonry, Prince Hall Freemasonry soon grew and organised  on a Grand Lodge system for each state [96]\n\n\nEmergence of Continental Freemasonry\nEnglish Freemasonry spread to France in the 1720s, first as lodges of expatriates and exiled Jacobites, and then as distinctively French lodges that still follow the ritual of the Moderns From France and England, Freemasonry spread to most of Continental Europe during the course of the 18th century The Grande Loge de France was formed under the Grand Mastership of the Duke of Clermont, who exercised only nominal authority His successor, the Duke of Orléans, reconstituted the central body as the Grand Orient de France in 1773 Briefly eclipsed during the French Revolution, French Freemasonry continued to grow in the next century, [100] at first under the leadership of Alexandre Francois Auguste de Grasse, Comte de Grassy-Tilly A career Army officer, he lived with his family in Charleston, South Carolina from 1793 to the early 1800s, after leaving Saint-Domingue, now Haiti, during the years of the Haitian Revolution.\n\n\nFreemasonry in the Middle East\nAfter the failure of the 1830 Italian revolution, a number of Italian Freemasons were forced to flee They secretly set up an approved chapter of Scottish Rite in Alexandria, a town already inhabited by a large Italian community Meanwhile, the French Freemasons publicly organised a local chapter in Alexandria in 1845 [101] During the 19th and 20th century Ottoman Empire, Masonic lodges operated widely across all parts of the empire and numerous Sufi orders shared a close relationship with them Many Young Turks affiliated with the Bektashi order were members and patrons of Freemasonry They were also closely allied against European imperialism Many Ottoman intellectuals believed that Sufism and Freemasonry shared close similarities in doctrines, spiritual outlook and mysticism [102]\n\n\nSchism\nThe ritual form on which the Grand Orient of France was based was abolished in England in the events leading to the formation of the United Grand Lodge of England in 1813 However, the two jurisdictions continued in amity, or mutual recognition, until events of the 1860s and 1870s drove a seemingly permanent wedge between them In 1868 the Supreme Council of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of the State of Louisiana appeared in the jurisdiction of the Grand Lodge of Louisiana, recognised by the Grand Orient de France, but regarded by the older body as an invasion of their jurisdiction The new Scottish Rite body admitted Black people The resolution of the Grand Orient the following year that neither colour, race, nor religion could disqualify a man from Masonry prompted the Grand Lodge to withdraw recognition, and it persuaded other American Grand Lodges to do the same [103]\n\n\nFreemasonry and women\nThe status of women in the old guilds and corporations of medieval masons remains uncertain The principle of \"femme sole\" allowed a widow to continue the trade of her husband, but its application had wide local variations, such as full membership of a trade body or limited trade by deputation or approved members of that body [113] In masonry, the small available evidence points to the less empowered end of the scale [114]\n\n\nDevelopment and expansion\nDuring the Age of the Enlightenment in the 18th century, Freemasons comprised an international network of like-minded men, often meeting in secret in ritualistic programs at their lodges They promoted the ideals of the Enlightenment and helped diffuse these values across Britain and France and other places British Freemasonry offered a systematic creed with its own myths, values and set of rituals It fostered new codes of conduct – including a communal understanding of liberty and equality inherited from guild sociability – \"liberty, fraternity, and equality\" [127] Scottish soldiers and Jacobite Scots brought to the Continent ideals of fraternity which reflected not the local system of Scottish customs but the institutions and ideals originating in the English Revolution against royal absolutism [128] Freemasonry was particularly prevalent in France – by 1789, there were between 50,000 and 100,000 French Masons, making Freemasonry the most popular of all Enlightenment associations [129]\n\n\n18th century

Enlightenment associations [129]\n\n\nFrance\nIn the 18th century, liberal French politicians met together in Masonic lodges to develop some of the Enlightenment ideas that dominated the French Revolution of 1789 [138] Avner Halpern has traced French Freemasonry's major role in building France's first modern political party in 1901, the Radical Party It used two Masonic devices: the \"civil leadership model\", which Freemasonry developed in late 19th century France, and the local Masonic congresses of the Grand Orient of France federations [139]\n\n\nRussia\nFreemasons had been active in Russia in the 18th century, working to introduce Enlightenment ideals; however, they were increasingly suppressed by the government [140] According to Ludwick Hass, Freemasonry was officially illegal in Tsarist Russia, but would later be introduced by exiles who returned after the 1905 revolution These individuals had been active Masons in Paris, where lodges were politically active in the new Radical Party In Russia, the Freemasons supported constitutional liberalism, and maintained ties with France while simplifying many of the ceremonial rituals Their secret meetings became a centre of progressive ideals, attracting politicians and activists The lodges initially supported World War I, promoting close ties with France Alexander Kerensky was an important Masonic activist who came to political power with the overthrow of the tsars, in 1917 The organization collapsed as the Bolsheviks took power and was again outlawed [141]\n\n\nItaly\nAccording to Adrian Lyttelton, in the early 20th century, Freemasonry was an influential but semi-secret force in Italian politics; with a strong presence among professionals and the middle class across Italy, its appeal spread to the leadership of the parliament, public administration, and the army The two main organisations were the Grand Orient and the Grand Lodge of Italy They had around 25,000 members in some 500 lodges Freemasons typically espoused anticlericalism and promoted unification The Catholic Church was a vigorous opponent of unification, and thus of the Freemasons; various national governments would repeatedly alternate and backpedal between the anticlerical side and the Church side [142] Politically, they promoted Italian nationalism focused on unification and undermining the power of the Catholic Church Freemasons took on the challenge of mobilizing the press, encouraging public opinion and the leading political parties in support of Italy's joining of the Allies of the First World War in 1914–1915 In 1919, they favoured a League of Nations to promote a new post-war, universal order based upon the peaceful coexistence of independent and democratic nations [143] In the early 1920s, many of Mussolini's collaborators, especially the leaders in organizing the March on Rome, were Masons The lodges hailed fascism as the saviour of Italy from Bolshevism; however, Mussolini decided he needed to come to terms with the Catholic Church, in the mid-1920s, outlawing Freemasonry [144]\n\n\nLatin America\nThe Spanish government outlawed Freemasonry in its overseas empire in the mid-18th century, and energetically enforced the ban Nevertheless, many Freemasons were active in planning and plotting for independence [145] Leaders with Freemason membership included Grand Master Francisco de Miranda, José de San Martin, Simón Bolivar, Bernardo O'Higgins, and many others [146] The movement was important after independence was achieved in the 1820s [147] In Brazil, many prominent men were Freemasons, and they played a leading role in the abolition of slavery [148]\n\n\nMexico\nFreemasons were leaders in liberalism and anti-clericalism in 19th and 20th-century Mexico Members included numerous top leaders [149] The Freemasons were divided regarding relations with the United States, with a pro-U.S faction supported by the American ambassador Joel Poinsett known as the \"Yorkinos.\" [150] [151] According to historian Karen Racine, Freemasons in the presidency of Mexico included: Guadalupe Victoria, Valentín Gómez Farías, Antonio López de Santa Anna, Benito Juárez, Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada, Porfirio Díaz, Francisco I Madero, Venustiano Carranza, Plutarco Elías Calles, Lázaro Cárdenas, Emilio Portes Gil, Pascual Ortiz Rubio, Abelardo L Rodríguez, and Miguel Alemán Valdés [152]\n\n\nChina\nThe first lodge formed in China was the Amity Lodge which constituted at Canton in 1767 In 1875, District Grand Lodge of China split into two Districts, Northern China, and Hong Kong and South China During the second world war, All Masonic activity in Hong Kong was brought to a halt due to the Japanese invasion After the 1949, the new China government (Communist) established, some lodges in China moved to Hong Kong or closed due to lack of new candidates [153]\n\n\nHong Kong\nRoyal Sussex Lodge No 501 was the first lodge established in Victoria City of Hong Kong on 29 April 1844.\n\n\nAnti-Masonry\nAnti-Masonry (alternatively called Anti-Freemasonry) has been defined as \"opposition to Freemasonry\", [156] [157] but there is no homogeneous anti-Masonic movement Anti-Masonry consists of widely differing criticisms from diverse (and often incompatible) groups who are hostile to Freemasonry in some form Critics have included religious groups, political groups, and conspiracy theorists, in particular, those espousing Masonic conspiracy theories or the Judeo-Masonic conspiracy theory Certain prominent Anti-Masons, such as Nesta Helen Webster, exclusively criticized \"Continental Masonry\", while considering \"Regular Masonry\" to be an honourable association [158]\n\n\nReligious opposition\nFreemasonry has attracted criticism from theocratic states and organised religions that believe it is in competition with religion or perceive the fraternity's views or practices as heterodox; it has also long been the target of conspiracy theories that assert Freemasonry to be an occult and evil power [163]\n\n\nChristianity and Freemasonry\nAlthough members of various faiths cite objections, certain Christian denominations have had high-profile negative attitudes to Masonry, banning or discouraging their members from being Freemasons The denomination with the longest history of objection to Freemasonry is the Catholic Church The objections raised by the Catholic Church are based on the allegation that Masonry teaches a naturalistic deistic religion which is in conflict with Church doctrine [164] More than 600 Papal pronouncements have been issued against Freemasonry [165] The first was Pope Clement XII's In eminenti apostolatus, 28 April 1738; the most recent was Pope Francis in a letter by the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith 13 November 2023 [166]\n\n\nIslam and Freemasonry\nOttoman Caliph Mahmud I outlawed Freemasonry in the Ottoman Empire in 1748 CE and since that time Freemasonry was equated with atheism in the Ottoman Empire and the broader Islamic world [184]\n\n\nPolitical opposition\nIn 1799, English Freemasonry almost came to a halt due to Parliamentary proclamation In the wake of the French Revolution, the Unlawful Societies Act banned any meetings of groups that required their members to take an oath or obligation [197]\n\n\nThe Holocaust\nThe preserved records of the Reichssicherheitshauptamt (the Reich Security Main Office) show the persecution of Freemasons during the Holocaust [208] RSHA Amt VII (Written Records), overseen by Professor Franz Six, was responsible for \"ideological\" tasks, by which was meant the creation of antisemitic and anti-Masonic propaganda While the number of victims is not accurately known, historians estimate that between 80,000 and 200,000 Freemasons were killed under the Nazi regime [209] Masonic concentration camp inmates were classified as political prisoners and wore an inverted red triangle [210] Hitler believed Freemasons had succumbed to Jews conspiring against Germany [211] [212]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nUnited States\n\n\nHistoriography and memory\n\n\nExternal links\n\n",

With a rich history spanning over four centuries, Freemasonry has evolved into a global organization with a diverse membership and a wide range of activities and traditions.\n\n**Masonic Lodge**\n\nThe Masonic lodge is the basic organizational unit of Freemasonry. It is a small group of men who come together to conduct the business of the lodge, which includes electing new members, appointing officers, and organizing social and charitable events. In addition to these formal business meetings, the lodge may also hold ceremonies to confer Masonic degrees or receive lectures on various topics related to Masonry.\n\n**Joining a Lodge**\n\nCandidates for Freemasonry typically have met the most active members of the lodge they are joining before being elected for initiation. The process of joining a lodge varies among Grand Lodges, but in modern times, interested individuals often look up a local lodge through the internet and may be introduced to a lodge social function or open evening. The onus is upon candidates to ask to join, and while they may be encouraged to ask, they may not be invited. Once the initial inquiry is made, a formal application may be proposed and seconded or announced in open lodge, and a more or less formal interview usually follows. If the candidate wishes to proceed, references are taken up during a period of notice so that members may enquire into the candidate's suitability and discuss it. Finally, the lodge takes an officially secret ballot on each application before a candidate is either initiated or rejected.\n\n**Organization**\n\nGrand Lodges and Grand Orients are independent and sovereign bodies that govern Masonry in a given country, state, or geographical area (termed a jurisdiction). There is no single overarching governing body that presides over worldwide Freemasonry; connections between different jurisdictions depend solely on mutual recognition. Each Grand Lodge maintains a list of other Grand Lodges that it recognizes, and when two Grand Lodges recognize and are in Masonic communication with each other, they are said to be in amity, and the brethren of each may visit each other's lodges and interact Masonically.\n\n**Recognition, Amity, and Regularity**\n\nRelations between Grand Lodges are determined by the concept of recognition. Each Grand Lodge maintains a list of other Grand Lodges that it recognizes, and when two Grand Lodges recognize and are in Masonic communication with each other, they are said to be in amity, and the brethren of each may visit each other's lodges and interact Masonically. There are many reasons one Grand Lodge will withhold or withdraw recognition from another, but the two most common are Exclusive Jurisdiction and Regularity. Exclusive Jurisdiction is a concept whereby normally only one Grand Lodge will be recognized in any geographical area.\n\n**Grand Lodges**\n\nGrand Lodges and Grand Orients are independent and sovereign bodies that govern Masonry in a given country, state, or geographical area (termed a jurisdiction). Each Grand Lodge maintains a list of other Grand Lodges that it recognizes, and when two Grand Lodges recognize and are in Masonic communication with each other, they are said to be in amity, and the brethren of each may visit each other's lodges and interact Masonically. Grand Lodges have a long history of independence and autonomy, with each having its own unique traditions and practices.\n\n**Modern Challenges and Evolution**\n\nThe concept of Exclusive Jurisdiction has been significantly challenged in the United States with the increasing recognition of Prince Hall Grand Lodges, a branch of Freemasonry created for African Americans. Historically, many \"mainstream\" or conservative U.S Grand Lodges refused to recognize Prince Hall Grand Lodges operating in their states, citing Exclusive Jurisdiction. However, this began to change in 1989 when the Grand Lodge of Connecticut extended recognition to its Prince Hall counterpart.\n\n**Regularity**\n\nRegularity is a concept based on adherence to Masonic Landmarks, the basic membership requirements, tenets, and rituals of the craft. Each Grand Lodge sets its own definition of what these landmarks are, and thus what is Regular and what is Irregular. Essentially, every Grand Lodge will hold that its landmarks (its requirements, tenets, and rituals) are Regular, and judge other Grand Lodges based on those.\n\n**Other Degrees, Orders, and Bodies**\n\nBlue Lodges, known as Craft Lodges in the United Kingdom, offer only the three traditional degrees. In most jurisdictions, the rank of past or installed master is also conferred in Blue/Craft Lodges. Master Masons are able to extend their Masonic experience by taking further degrees, in appendant or other bodies, whether or not approved by their own Grand Lodge.\n\n**Ritual and Symbolism**\n\nFreemasonry describes itself as a \"beautiful system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols.\" The symbolism is mainly, but not exclusively, drawn from the tools of stonemasons – the square and compasses, the level and plumb rule, the trowel, the rough and smooth ashlars, among others. Moral lessons are attributed to each of these tools, although the assignment is by no means consistent.\n\n**History**\n\nThe history of Freemasonry is a complex and multifaceted one, spanning over four centuries. Since the middle of the 19th century, Masonic historians have sought the origins of the movement in a series of similar documents known as the Old Charges, dating from the Regius Poem in about 1425 to the beginning of the 18th century.\n\n**Origins**\n\nThe origins of Freemasonry are shrouded in mystery, and there is ongoing debate among historians about the true nature and purpose of the earliest Masonic organizations. The Old Charges, a series of documents dating from the 15th century, provide some insights into the early history of Freemasonry, but their accuracy and reliability are disputed.\n\n**North America**\n\nThe earliest known American lodges were in Pennsylvania, established in the early 18th century. The Grand Lodge of England appointed a Provincial Grand Master for North America in 1731, based in Pennsylvania, leading to the creation of the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania.\n\n**Jamaican Freemasonry**\n\nFreemasonry was imported to Jamaica by British immigrants who colonized the island for over 300 years. In 1908, there were eleven recorded Masonic lodges, which included three Grand Lodges, two Craft lodges, and two Rose Croix chapters.\n\n**Prince Hall Freemasonry**\n\nPrince Hall Freemasonry exists because of the refusal of early American lodges to admit African Americans. In 1775, an African American named Prince Hall, along with 14 other African American men, was initiated into a British military lodge with a warrant from the Grand Lodge of Ireland, having failed to obtain admission from the other lodges in Boston.\n\n**Emergence of Continental Freemasonry**\n\nEnglish Freemasonry spread to France in the 1720s, first as lodges of expatriates and exiled Jacobites, and then as distinctively French lodges that still follow the ritual of the Moderns. From France and England, Freemasonry spread to most of Continental Europe during the course of the 18th century.\n\n**Freemasonry in the Middle East**\n\nAfter the failure of the 1830 Italian revolution, a number of Italian Freemasons were forced to flee and secretly set up an approved chapter of Scottish Rite in Alexandria. During the 19th and 20th century Ottoman Empire, Masonic lodges operated widely across all parts of the empire and numerous Sufi orders shared a close relationship with them.\n\n**Schism**\n\nThe ritual form on which the Grand Orient of France was based was abolished in England in the events leading to the formation of the United Grand Lodge of England in 1813. However, the two jurisdictions continued in amity until events of the 1860s and 1870s drove a seemingly permanent wedge between them.\n\n**Freemasonry and Women**\n\nThe status of women in the old guilds and corporations of medieval masons remains uncertain. In masonry, the small available evidence points to the less empowered end of the scale.\n\n**Development and Expansion**\n\nDuring the Age of the Enlightenment in the 18th century, Freemasons comprised an international network of like-minded men, often meeting in secret in ritualistic programs at their lodges. They promoted the ideals of the Enlightenment and helped diffuse these values across Britain and France and other places.\n\n**18th Century Enlightenment**\n\nThe 18th century Enlightenment was a time of great intellectual and philosophical change, and Freemasonry played a significant role in promoting the ideals of the Enlightenment. Freemasons believed in the importance of reason, individualism, and the pursuit of knowledge, and they sought to create a more just and equitable society.\n\n**France**\n\nIn the 18th century, liberal French politicians met together in Masonic lodges to develop some of the Enlightenment ideas that dominated the French Revolution of 1789. Avner Halpern has traced French Freemasonry's major role in building France's first modern political party in 1901, the Radical Party.\n\n**Russia**\n\nFreemasons had been active in Russia in the 18th century, working to introduce Enlightenment ideals. However, they were increasingly suppressed by the government. According to Ludwick Hass, Freemasonry was officially illegal in Tsarist Russia, but would later be introduced by exiles who returned after the 1905 revolution.\n\n**Italy**\n\nAccording to Adrian Lyttelton, in the early 20th century, Freemasonry was an influential but semi-secret force in Italian politics. With a strong presence among professionals and the middle class across Italy, its appeal spread to the leadership of the parliament, public administration, and the army.\n\n**Latin America**\n\nThe Spanish government outlawed Freemasonry in its overseas empire in the mid-18th century, and energetically enforced the ban. Nevertheless, many Freemasons were active in planning and plotting for independence. Leaders with Freemason membership included Grand Master Francisco de Miranda, José de San Martin, Simón Bolivar, Bernardo O'Higgins, and many others.\n\n**Mexico**\n\nFreemasons were leaders in liberalism and anti-clericalism in 19th and 20th-century Mexico. Members included numerous top leaders. The Freemasons were divided regarding relations with the United States, with a pro-U.S faction supported by the American ambassador Joel Poinsett known as the \"Yorkinos.\"\n\n**China**\n\nThe first lodge formed in China was the Amity Lodge which constituted at Canton in 1767.

outline:\n\n\nMasonic lodge\nThe Masonic lodge is the basic organisational unit of Freemasonry [12] The Lodge meets regularly and conducts the usual formal business of any small organisation (approve minutes, elect new members, appoint officers and take their reports, consider correspondence, bills and annual accounts, organise social and charitable events, etc.) In addition to such business, the meeting may perform a ceremony to confer a Masonic degree [13] or receive a lecture, which is usually on some aspect of Masonic history or ritual [14] At the conclusion of the meeting, the Lodge may hold a formal dinner, or festive board, sometimes involving toasting and song [15]\n\n\nJoining a lodge\nCandidates for Freemasonry will usually have met the most active members of the Lodge they are joining before being elected for initiation The process varies among Grand Lodges, but in modern times interested people often look up a local Lodge through the Internet and will typically be

period of notice so that members may enquire into the candidate's suitability and discuss it Finally, the Lodge takes an officially secret ballot on each application before a candidate is either initiated or rejected [27] The exact number of adverse ballots (\"blackballs\") required to reject a candidate varies between Masonic jurisdictions As an example, the United Grand Lodge of England only requires a single \"blackball\", while the Grand Lodge of New York requires three.\n\n\nOrganisation\nGrand Lodges and Grand Orients are independent and sovereign bodies that govern Masonry in a given country, state or geographical area (termed a jurisdiction) There is no single overarching governing body that presides over worldwide Freemasonry; connections between different jurisdictions depend solely on mutual recognition [34] [35]\n\n\nGrand Lodges\nGrand Lodges and Grand Orients are independent and sovereign bodies that govern Masonry in a given country, state or geographical area (termed a jurisdiction) There is no single overarching governing body that presides over worldwide Freemasonry; connections between different jurisdictions depend solely on mutual recognition [34] [35]\n\n\nRecognition, amity and regularity\nRelations between Grand Lodges are determined by the concept of Recognition Each Grand Lodge maintains a list of other Grand Lodges that it recognises [44] When two Grand Lodges recognise and are in Masonic communication with each other, they are said to be in amity, and the brethren of each may visit each other's Lodges and interact Masonically When two Grand Lodges are not in amity, inter-visitation is not allowed There are many reasons one Grand Lodge will withhold or withdraw recognition from another, but the two most common are Exclusive Jurisdiction and Regularity [45]\n\n\nExclusive Jurisdiction\nExclusive Jurisdiction is a concept whereby normally only one Grand Lodge will be recognised in any geographical area If two Grand Lodges claim jurisdiction over the same area, the other Grand Lodges will have to choose between them, and they may not all decide to recognise the same one (In 1849, for example, the Grand Lodge of New York split into two rival factions, each claiming to be the legitimate Grand Lodge Other Grand Lodges had to choose between them until the schism was healed [46]) Exclusive Jurisdiction can be waived when the two overlapping Grand Lodges are themselves in amity and agree to share jurisdiction For example, since the Grand Lodge of Connecticut is in amity with the Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Connecticut, the principle of Exclusive Jurisdiction does not apply, and other Grand Lodges may recognise both [47] Likewise, the five distinct kinds of lodges in Germany have nominally united under one Grand Lodge in order to obtain international recognition.\n\n\nModern Challenges and Evolution\nThe concept of Exclusive Jurisdiction has been significantly challenged in the United States with the increasing recognition of Prince Hall Grand Lodges, a branch of Freemasonry created for African Americans Historically, many \"mainstream\" or conservative U.S Grand Lodges refused to recognize Prince Hall Grand Lodges operating in their states, citing Exclusive Jurisdiction However, this began to change in 1989 when the Grand Lodge of Connecticut extended recognition to its Prince Hall counterpart [48] [49]\n\n\nRegularity\nRegularity is a concept based on adherence to Masonic Landmarks, the basic membership requirements, tenets and rituals of the craft Each Grand Lodge sets its own definition of what these landmarks are, and thus what is Regular and what is Irregular (and the definitions do not necessarily agree between Grand Lodges) Essentially, every Grand Lodge will hold that its landmarks (its requirements, tenets and rituals) are Regular, and judge other Grand Lodges based on those If the differences are significant, one Grand Lodge may declare the other \"Irregular\" and withdraw or withhold recognition [53] [54]\n\n\nOther degrees, orders, and bodies\nBlue Lodges, known as Craft Lodges in the United Kingdom, offer only the three traditional degrees In most jurisdictions, the rank of past or installed master is also conferred in Blue/Craft Lodges Master Masons are able to extend their Masonic experience by taking further degrees, in appendant or other bodies whether or not approved by their own Grand Lodge [56]\n\n\nRitual and symbolism\nFreemasonry describes itself as a \"beautiful system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols\" [60] The symbolism is mainly, but not exclusively, drawn from the tools of stonemasons – the square and compasses, the level and plumb rule, the trowel, the rough and smooth ashlars, among others Moral lessons are attributed to each of these tools, although the assignment is by no means consistent The meaning of the symbolism is taught and explored through ritual, [24] and in lectures and articles by individual Masons who offer their personal insights and opinions.\n\n\nHistory\nSince the middle of the 19th century, Masonic historians have sought the origins of the movement in a series of similar documents known as the Old Charges, dating from the Regius Poem in about 1425 [65] to the beginning of the 18th century Alluding to the membership of a lodge of operative masons, they relate it to a mythologised history of the craft, the duties of its grades, and the manner in which oaths of fidelity are to be taken on joining [66] The 15th century also sees the first evidence of ceremonial regalia [67]\n\n\nOrigins\nSince the middle of the 19th century, Masonic historians have sought the origins of the movement in a series of similar documents known as the Old Charges,

earliest known American lodges were in Pennsylvania The collector for the port of Pennsylvania, John Moore, wrote of attending lodges there in 1715, two years before the putative formation of the first Grand Lodge in London The Grand Lodge of England appointed a Provincial Grand Master for North America in 1731, based in Pennsylvania, [81] leading to the creation of the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania.\n\n\nJamaican Freemasonry\nFreemasonry was imported to Jamaica by British immigrants who colonized the island for over 300 years In 1908, there were eleven recorded Masonic lodges, which included three Grand Lodges, two Craft lodges, and two Rose Croix chapters [91] During slavery, the lodges were open to all \"freeborn\" men According to the Jamaican 1834 census, that potentially included 5,000 free black men and 40,000 free people of colour (mixed race) [92] After the full abolition of slavery in 1838, the Lodges were open to all Jamaican men of any race [93] Jamaica also kept close relationships with Masons from other countries Jamaican Freemasonry historian Jackie Ranston, noted that:\n\n\nPrince Hall Freemasonry\nPrince Hall Freemasonry exists because of the refusal of early American lodges to admit African Americans In 1775, an African American named Prince Hall, [95] along with 14 other African American men, was initiated into a British military lodge with a warrant from the Grand Lodge of Ireland, having failed to obtain admission from the other lodges in Boston When the British military Lodge left North America after the end of the Revolution, those 15 men were given the authority to meet as a Lodge, but not to initiate Masons In 1784, these individuals obtained a Warrant from the Grand Lodge of England (Premiere Grand Lodge) and formed African Lodge, Number 459 When the two English grand lodges united in 1813, all U.S.-based Lodges were stricken from their rolls – largely because of the War of 1812 Thus, separated from both English jurisdiction and any concordantly recognised U.S Grand Lodge, African Lodge retitled itself as the African Lodge, Number 1 – and became a de facto Grand Lodge (This lodge is not to be confused with the various Grand Lodges in Africa.) As with the rest of U.S Freemasonry, Prince Hall Freemasonry soon grew and organised  on a Grand Lodge system for each state [96]\n\n\nEmergence of Continental Freemasonry\nEnglish Freemasonry spread to France in the 1720s, first as lodges of expatriates and exiled Jacobites, and then as distinctively French lodges that still follow the ritual of the Moderns From France and England, Freemasonry spread to most of Continental Europe during the course of the 18th century The Grande Loge de France was formed under the Grand Mastership of the Duke of Clermont, who exercised only nominal authority His successor, the Duke of Orléans, reconstituted the central body as the Grand Orient de France in 1773 Briefly eclipsed during the French Revolution, French Freemasonry continued to grow in the next century, [100] at first under the leadership of Alexandre Francois Auguste de Grasse, Comte de Grassy-Tilly A career Army officer, he lived with his family in Charleston, South Carolina from 1793 to the early 1800s, after leaving Saint-Domingue, now Haiti, during the years of the Haitian Revolution.\n\n\nFreemasonry in the Middle East\nAfter the failure of the 1830 Italian revolution, a number of Italian Freemasons were forced to flee They secretly set up an approved chapter of Scottish Rite in Alexandria, a town already inhabited by a large Italian community Meanwhile, the French Freemasons publicly organised a local chapter in Alexandria in 1845 [101] During the 19th and 20th century Ottoman Empire, Masonic lodges operated widely across all parts of the empire and numerous Sufi orders shared a close relationship with them Many Young Turks affiliated with the Bektashi order were members and patrons of Freemasonry They were also closely allied against European imperialism Many Ottoman intellectuals believed that Sufism and Freemasonry shared close similarities in doctrines, spiritual outlook and mysticism [102]\n\n\nSchism\nThe ritual form on which the Grand Orient of France was based was abolished in England in the events leading to the formation of the United Grand Lodge of England in 1813 However, the two jurisdictions continued in amity, or mutual recognition, until events of the 1860s and 1870s drove a seemingly permanent wedge between them In 1868 the Supreme Council of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of the State of Louisiana appeared in the jurisdiction of the Grand Lodge of Louisiana, recognised by the Grand Orient de France, but regarded by the older body as an invasion of their jurisdiction The new Scottish Rite body admitted Black people The resolution of the Grand Orient the following year that neither colour, race, nor religion could disqualify a man from Masonry prompted the Grand Lodge to withdraw recognition, and it persuaded other American Grand Lodges to do the same [103]\n\n\nFreemasonry and women\nThe status of women in the old guilds and corporations of medieval masons remains uncertain The principle of \"femme sole\" allowed a widow to continue the trade of her husband, but its application had wide local variations, such as full membership of a trade body or limited trade by deputation or approved members of that body [113] In masonry, the small available evidence points to the less empowered end of the scale [114]\n\n\nDevelopment and expansion\nDuring the Age of the Enlightenment in the 18th century, Freemasons comprised an international network of like-minded men, often meeting in secret in ritualistic programs at their lodges They promoted the ideals of the Enlightenment and helped diffuse these values across Britain and France and other places British Freemasonry offered a systematic creed with its own myths, values and set of rituals It fostered new codes of conduct – including a communal understanding of liberty and equality inherited from guild sociability – \"liberty, fraternity, and equality\" [127] Scottish soldiers and Jacobite Scots brought to the Continent ideals of fraternity which reflected not the local system of Scottish customs but the institutions and ideals originating in the English Revolution against royal absolutism [128] Freemasonry was particularly prevalent in France – by 1789, there were between 50,000 and 100,000 French Masons, making Freemasonry the most popular of all Enlightenment associations [129]\n\n\n18th century

Revolution of 1789 [138] Avner Halpern has traced French Freemasonry's major role in building France's first modern political party in 1901, the Radical Party It used two Masonic devices: the \"civil leadership model\", which Freemasonry developed in late 19th century France, and the local Masonic congresses of the Grand Orient of France federations [139]\n\n\nRussia\nFreemasons had been active in Russia in the 18th century, working to introduce Enlightenment ideals; however, they were increasingly suppressed by the government [140] According to Ludwick Hass, Freemasonry was officially illegal in Tsarist Russia, but would later be introduced by exiles who returned after the 1905 revolution These individuals had been active Masons in Paris, where lodges were politically active in the new Radical Party In Russia, the Freemasons supported constitutional liberalism, and maintained ties with France while simplifying many of the ceremonial rituals Their secret meetings became a centre of progressive ideals, attracting politicians and activists The lodges initially supported World War I, promoting close ties with France Alexander Kerensky was an important Masonic activist who came to political power with the overthrow of the tsars, in 1917 The organization collapsed as the Bolsheviks took power and was again outlawed [141]\n\n\nItaly\nAccording to Adrian Lyttelton, in the early 20th century, Freemasonry was an influential but semi-secret force in Italian politics; with a strong presence among professionals and the middle class across Italy, its appeal spread to the leadership of the parliament, public administration, and the army The two main organisations were the Grand Orient and the Grand Lodge of Italy They had around 25,000 members in some 500 lodges Freemasons typically espoused anticlericalism and promoted unification The Catholic Church was a vigorous opponent of unification, and thus of the Freemasons; various national governments would repeatedly alternate and backpedal between the anticlerical side and the Church side [142] Politically, they promoted Italian nationalism focused on unification and undermining the power of the Catholic Church Freemasons took on the challenge of mobilizing the press, encouraging public opinion and the leading political parties in support of Italy's joining of the Allies of the First World War in 1914–1915 In 1919, they favoured a League of Nations to promote a new post-war, universal order based upon the peaceful coexistence of independent and democratic nations [143] In the early 1920s, many of Mussolini's collaborators, especially the leaders in organizing the March on Rome, were Masons The lodges hailed fascism as the saviour of Italy from Bolshevism; however, Mussolini decided he needed to come to terms with the Catholic Church, in the mid-1920s, outlawing Freemasonry [144]\n\n\nLatin America\nThe Spanish government outlawed Freemasonry in its overseas empire in the mid-18th century, and energetically enforced the ban Nevertheless, many Freemasons were active in planning and plotting for independence [145] Leaders with Freemason membership included Grand Master Francisco de Miranda, José de San Martin, Simón Bolivar, Bernardo O'Higgins, and many others [146] The movement was important after independence was achieved in the 1820s [147] In Brazil, many prominent men were Freemasons, and they played a leading role in the abolition of slavery [148]\n\n\nMexico\nFreemasons were leaders in liberalism and anti-clericalism in 19th and 20th-century Mexico Members included numerous top leaders [149] The Freemasons were divided regarding relations with the United States, with a pro-U.S faction supported by the American ambassador Joel Poinsett known as the \"Yorkinos.\" [150] [151] According to historian Karen Racine, Freemasons in the presidency of Mexico included: Guadalupe Victoria, Valentín Gómez Farías, Antonio López de Santa Anna, Benito Juárez, Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada, Porfirio Díaz, Francisco I Madero, Venustiano Carranza, Plutarco Elías Calles, Lázaro Cárdenas, Emilio Portes Gil, Pascual Ortiz Rubio, Abelardo L Rodríguez, and Miguel Alemán Valdés [152]\n\n\nChina\nThe first lodge formed in China was the Amity Lodge which constituted at Canton in 1767 In 1875, District Grand Lodge of China split into two Districts, Northern China, and Hong Kong and South China During the second world war, All Masonic activity in Hong Kong was brought to a halt due to the Japanese invasion After the 1949, the new China government (Communist) established, some lodges in China moved to Hong Kong or closed due to lack of new candidates [153]\n\n\nHong Kong\nRoyal Sussex Lodge No 501 was the first lodge established in Victoria City of Hong Kong on 29 April 1844.\n\n\nAnti-Masonry\nAnti-Masonry (alternatively called Anti-Freemasonry) has been defined as \"opposition to Freemasonry\", [156] [157] but there is no homogeneous anti-Masonic movement Anti-Masonry consists of widely differing criticisms from diverse (and often incompatible) groups who are hostile to Freemasonry in some form Critics have included religious groups, political groups, and conspiracy theorists, in particular, those espousing Masonic conspiracy theories or the Judeo-Masonic conspiracy theory Certain prominent Anti-Masons, such as Nesta Helen Webster, exclusively criticized \"Continental Masonry\", while considering \"Regular Masonry\" to be an honourable association [158]\n\n\nReligious opposition\nFreemasonry has attracted criticism from theocratic states and organised religions that believe it is in competition with religion or perceive the fraternity's views or practices as heterodox; it has also long been the target of conspiracy theories that assert Freemasonry to be an occult and evil power [163]\n\n\nChristianity and Freemasonry\nAlthough members of various faiths cite objections, certain Christian denominations have had high-profile negative attitudes to Masonry, banning or discouraging their members from being Freemasons The denomination with the longest history of objection to Freemasonry is the Catholic Church The objections raised by the Catholic Church are based on the allegation that Masonry teaches a naturalistic deistic religion which is in conflict with Church doctrine [164] More than 600 Papal pronouncements have been issued against Freemasonry [165] The first was Pope Clement XII's In eminenti apostolatus, 28 April 1738; the most recent was Pope Francis in a letter by the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith 13 November 2023 [166]\n\n\nIslam and Freemasonry\nOttoman Caliph Mahmud I outlawed Freemasonry in the Ottoman Empire in 1748 CE and since that time Freemasonry was equated with atheism in the Ottoman Empire and the broader Islamic world [184]\n\n\nPolitical opposition\nIn 1799, English Freemasonry almost came to a halt due to Parliamentary proclamation In the wake of the French Revolution, the Unlawful Societies Act banned any meetings of groups that required their members to take an oath or obligation [197]\n\n\nThe Holocaust\nThe preserved records of the Reichssicherheitshauptamt (the Reich Security Main Office) show the persecution of Freemasons during the Holocaust [208] RSHA Amt VII (Written Records), overseen by Professor Franz Six, was responsible for \"ideological\" tasks, by which was meant the creation of antisemitic and anti-Masonic propaganda While the number of victims is not accurately known, historians estimate that between 80,000 and 200,000 Freemasons were killed under the Nazi regime [209] Masonic concentration camp inmates were classified as political prisoners and wore an inverted red triangle [210] Hitler believed Freemasons had succumbed to Jews conspiring against Germany [211] [212]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nUnited States\n\n\nHistoriography and memory\n\n\nExternal

a well-armed French fleet attacked Veracruz, landing a large French force and driving President Juárez and his government into retreat [11] Moving on from Veracruz towards Mexico City, the French army encountered heavy resistance from the Mexicans close to Puebla, at the Mexican forts of Loreto and Guadalupe [12] The French army of 6,500–8,000 [13] [14] [12] attacked the poorly equipped Mexican army of 4,000 [12] [note 1] On May 5, 1862, [15] the Mexicans decisively defeated the French army [16] [17] [18] The victory represented a significant morale boost to the Mexican army and the Mexican

troops, the French were able to defeat the Mexican army, capture Mexico City, and install Emperor Maximilian I as ruler of Mexico [12] The French victory was itself short-lived, lasting only three years, from 1864 to 1867 [12] By 1865, \"with the American Civil War now over, the U.S began to provide more political and military assistance to Mexico to expel the French.\" [12] Upon the conclusion of the American Civil War, Napoleon III, facing a persistent Mexican guerilla resistance, the threat of war with Prussia, and \"the prospect of a serious scrap with the United States\", retreated from Mexico starting in 1866 [22] The Mexicans recaptured Mexico City, and Maximilian I was apprehended and executed, along with his Mexican generals Miguel Miramón and Tomás Mejía Camacho in Cerro de las

is a Mexican holiday that commemorates the Mexican army's victory over the French Empire at the Battle of Puebla on May 5, 1862. The holiday has become a significant cultural event not only in Mexico but also in the United States and other countries around the world. While it is often misunderstood as Mexico's independence day, Cinco de Mayo is a celebration of Mexican culture, history, and resilience.\n\n**Background**\n\nCinco de Mayo has its roots in the second French intervention in Mexico, which took place in the aftermath of the 1846–48 Mexican–American War and the 1858–61 Reform War. The Reform War was a civil war that pitted Liberals (who believed in separation of church and state and freedom of religion) against Conservatives (who favored a tight bond between the Catholic Church and the Mexican state).

Moving on from Veracruz towards Mexico City, the French army encountered heavy resistance from the Mexicans close to Puebla, at the Mexican forts of Loreto and Guadalupe.\n\nThe French army of 6,500–8,000 attacked the poorly equipped Mexican army of 4,000. On May 5, 1862, the Mexicans decisively defeated the French army. The victory represented a significant morale boost to the Mexican army and the Mexican people at large and helped to establish a sense of national unity and patriotism.\n\n**French Invasion and Mexican Victory**\n\nThe French army, led by General Charles de Lorencez, had been marching towards Puebla, intent on capturing the city and continuing their march to Mexico City. However, the Mexican forces, led by General Ignacio Zaragoza, were well-prepared and determined to defend their city.\n\nThe battle was fierce, with both sides suffering heavy casualties. However, the Mexicans were able to hold off the French, using a combination of artillery and infantry to repel the attack. The French army was ultimately forced to retreat, leaving behind many of their dead and wounded.\n\nThe victory at Puebla was a significant turning point in the war, marking a major defeat for the French and a boost to the morale of the Mexican army. It also marked a turning point in the presidency of Benito Juárez, who would go on to lead Mexico to victory in the war against France.\n\n**Events After the Battle**\n\nThe Mexican victory, however, was short-lived. A year later, with 30,000 troops, the French were able to defeat the Mexican army, capture Mexico City, and install Emperor Maximilian I as ruler of Mexico.

The album featured Maceo Parker and Fred Wesley. The band used heroin while recording the album, which influenced the lyrics and music.

streaming music reached 118.1 billion streams in 2013 [38]\n\n\nTransition from DVD\nOne of the movie streaming industry's largest impacts was on the DVD industry, which drastically dropped in popularity and profitability with the mass popularization of online content [43] The rise of media streaming caused the downfall of many DVD rental companies, such as Blockbuster In July 2015, The New York Times published an article about Netflix's DVD services It stated that Netflix was continuing their DVD services with 5.3 million subscribers, which was a significant drop from the previous year On the other hand, their streaming service had 65 million members [44]\n\n\nNapster\nMusic streaming is one of the most popular ways in which consumers interact with streaming media In the age of digitization, the private consumption of music has transformed into a public good, largely due to one player in the market: Napster.\n\n\nThe fight for intellectual property rights: A&M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc.\nThe lawsuit A&M Records, Inc v Napster, Inc fundamentally changed the way consumers interact with music streaming It was argued on 2 October 2000, and was decided on 12 February 2001 The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that a P2P file-sharing service could be held liable for contributory and vicarious infringement of copyright, serving as a landmark decision for Intellectual property law [50]\n\n\nMusic streaming platforms\nAlthough music streaming is no longer a freely replicable public good, streaming platforms such as Spotify, Deezer, Apple Music, SoundCloud, YouTube Music, and Amazon Music have shifted music streaming to a club-type good While some platforms, most notably Spotify, give customers access to a freemium service that enables the use of limited features for exposure to advertisements, most companies operate under a premium subscription model [53] Under such circumstances, music streaming is financially excludable, requiring that customers pay a monthly fee for access to a music library, but non-rival, since one customer's use does not impair another's.\n\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic\nBy August 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had streaming services busier than ever In the UK alone, twelve million people joined a new streaming service that they had not previously had [58]\n\n\nLocal/home streaming\nStreaming also refers to the offline streaming of multimedia at home This is made possible by technologies such as DLNA, which allow devices on the same local network to connect to each other and share media [62] [63] Such capabilities are heightened using network-attached storage (NAS) devices at home, or using specialized software like Plex Media Server, Jellyfin or TwonkyMedia [64]\n\n\nTechnologies\nA broadband speed of 2 Mbit/s or more is recommended for streaming standard-definition video, [65] for example to a Roku, Apple TV, Google TV or a Sony TV Blu-ray Disc Player 5 Mbit/s is recommended for high-definition content and 9 Mbit/s for ultra-high-definition content [66] Streaming media storage size is calculated from the streaming bandwidth and length of the media using the following formula (for a single user and file): storage size in megabytes is equal to length (in seconds) × bit rate (in bit/s) / (8 × 1024 × 1024) For example, one hour of digital video encoded at 300 kbit/s (this was a typical broadband video in 2005 and it was usually encoded in 320 × 240 resolution) will be: (3,600 s × 300,000 bit/s) / (8 × 1024 × 1024) requires around 128 MB of storage.\n\n\nBandwidth\nA

and audio streams are compressed to make the file size smaller Audio coding formats include MP3, Vorbis, AAC and Opus Video coding formats include H.264, HEVC, VP8 and VP9 Encoded audio and video streams are assembled in a container bitstream such as MP4, FLV, WebM, ASF or ISMA The bitstream is delivered from a streaming server to a streaming client (e.g., the computer user with their Internet-connected laptop) using a transport protocol, such as Adobe's RTMP or RTP.\n\n\nRecording\nMedia that is livestreamed can be recorded through certain media players, such as VLC player, or through the use of a screen recorder Live-streaming platforms such as Twitch may also incorporate a video on demand system that allows automatic recording of live broadcasts so that they can be watched later [74] YouTube also has recordings of live broadcasts, including television shows aired on major networks These streams have the potential to be recorded by anyone who has access to them, whether legally or otherwise [75]\n\n\nView recommendation\nMost streaming services feature a recommender system for viewing based on each user's view history in conjunction with all viewers' aggregated view histories Rather than focusing on subjective categorization of content by content curators), there is an assumption that, with the immensity of data collected on viewing habits, the choices of those who are first to view content can be algorithmically extrapolated to the totality of the user base, with increasing probabilistic accuracy as to the likelihood of their choosing and enjoying the recommended content as more data is collected [76]\n\n\nApplications and marketing\nUseful and typical applications of streaming are, for example, long video lectures performed online [77] An advantage of this presentation is that these lectures can be very long, although they can always be interrupted or repeated at arbitrary places Streaming enables new content marketing concepts For example, the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra sells Internet live streams of whole concerts instead of several CDs or similar fixed media in their Digital Concert Hall [78] using YouTube for trailers These online concerts are also spread over a lot of different places, including cinemas at various places on the globe A similar concept is used by the Metropolitan Opera in New York There is also a livestream from the International Space Station [79] [80] In video entertainment, video streaming platforms like Netflix, Hulu, and Disney+ are mainstream elements of the media industry [81]\n\n\nChallenges\nFor over-the-top media service (OTT) platforms, the original content captures additional subscribers [86] This presents copyright issues and the potential for international exploitation through streaming, [87] widespread use of standards, and metadata in digital files [88] The WIPO has indicated several basic copyright issues arising for those pursuing work in the film [89] [90] and music industries [91] in the era of streaming.\n\n\nCopyright issues\nFor over-the-top media service (OTT) platforms, the original content captures additional subscribers [86] This

1990s to early 2000s\nDuring the late 1990s and early 2000s, users had increased access to computer networks, especially the Internet During the early 2000s, users had access to increased network bandwidth, especially in the last mile These technological improvements facilitated the streaming of audio and video content to computer users in their homes and workplaces There was also an increasing use of standard protocols and formats, such as TCP/IP, HTTP, and HTML, as the Internet became increasingly commercialized, which led to an infusion of investment into the sector.\n\n\nBusiness developments\nXing Technology was founded in 1989 and developed a JPEG streaming product called \"StreamWorks\"  Another streaming product appeared in late 1992 and was named StarWorks [21] StarWorks enabled on-demand MPEG-1 full-motion videos to be randomly accessed on corporate Ethernet networks Starworks was from Starlight Networks, which also pioneered live video streaming on Ethernet and via Internet Protocol over satellites with Hughes Network Systems [22] Other early companies that created streaming media technology include Progressive Networks and Protocomm prior to widespread World Wide Web usage  After the Netscape IPO in 1995 (and the release of Windows 95 with built-in TCP/IP support), usage of the Internet expanded, and many companies \"went public\", including Progressive Networks (which was renamed \"RealNetworks\", and listed on Nasdaq as \"RNWK\") As the web became even more popular in the late 90s, streaming video on the internet blossomed from startups such as Vivo Software (later acquired by RealNetworks), VDOnet (acquired by RealNetworks), Precept (acquired by Cisco), and Xing (acquired by RealNetworks) [23]\n\n\nStreaming wars\nThe term streaming wars was coined to describe the new era (starting in the late 2010s) of competition between video streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, Max, Disney+, Paramount+, Apple TV+, Peacock, and many more [6] [32]\n\n\nUse by the general public\nAdvances in computer networking, combined with powerful home computers and operating systems, have made streaming media affordable and easy for the public Stand-alone Internet radio devices emerged to offer listeners a non-technical option for listening to audio streams These audio-streaming services became increasingly popular; streaming music reached 118.1 billion streams in 2013 [38]\n\n\nTransition from DVD\nOne of the movie streaming industry's largest impacts was on the DVD industry, which drastically dropped in popularity and profitability with the mass popularization of online content [43] The rise of media streaming caused the downfall of many DVD rental companies, such as Blockbuster In July 2015, The New York Times published an article about Netflix's DVD services It stated that Netflix was continuing their DVD services with 5.3 million subscribers, which was a significant drop from the previous year On the other hand, their streaming service had 65 million members [44]\n\n\nNapster\nMusic streaming is one of the most popular ways in which consumers interact with streaming media In the age of digitization, the private consumption of music has transformed into a public good, largely due to one player in the market: Napster.\n\n\nThe fight for intellectual property rights: A&M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc.\nThe lawsuit A&M Records, Inc v Napster, Inc fundamentally changed the way consumers interact with music streaming It was argued on 2 October 2000, and was decided on 12 February 2001 The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that a P2P file-sharing service could be held liable for contributory and vicarious infringement of copyright, serving as a landmark decision for Intellectual property law [50]\n\n\nMusic streaming platforms\nAlthough music streaming is no longer a freely replicable public good, streaming platforms such as Spotify, Deezer, Apple Music, SoundCloud, YouTube Music, and Amazon Music have shifted music streaming to a club-type good While some platforms, most notably Spotify, give customers access to a freemium service that enables the use of limited features for exposure to advertisements, most companies operate under a premium subscription model [53] Under such circumstances, music streaming is financially excludable, requiring that customers pay a monthly fee for access to a music library, but non-rival, since one customer's use does not impair another's.\n\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic\nBy August 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had streaming services busier than ever In the UK alone, twelve million people joined a new streaming service that they had not previously had [58]\n\n\nLocal/home streaming\nStreaming also refers to the offline streaming of multimedia at home This is made possible by technologies such as DLNA, which allow devices on the same local network to connect to each other and share media [62] [63] Such capabilities are heightened using network-attached storage (NAS) devices at home, or using specialized software like Plex Media Server, Jellyfin or TwonkyMedia [64]\n\n\nTechnologies\nA broadband speed of 2 Mbit/s or more is recommended for streaming standard-definition video, [65] for example to a Roku, Apple TV, Google TV or a Sony TV Blu-ray Disc Player 5 Mbit/s is recommended for high-definition content and 9 Mbit/s for ultra-high-definition content [66] Streaming media storage size is calculated from the streaming bandwidth and length of the media using the following formula (for a single user and file): storage size in megabytes is equal to length (in seconds) × bit rate (in bit/s) / (8 × 1024 × 1024) For example, one hour of digital video encoded at 300 kbit/s (this was a typical broadband video in 2005 and it was usually encoded in 320 × 240 resolution) will be: (3,600 s × 300,000 bit/s) / (8 × 1024 × 1024) requires around 128 MB of storage.\n\n\nBandwidth\nA broadband speed of 2 Mbit/s or more is recommended for streaming standard-definition video, [65] for example to a Roku, Apple TV, Google TV or a Sony TV Blu-ray Disc Player 5 Mbit/s is recommended for

and audio streams are compressed to make the file size smaller Audio coding formats include MP3, Vorbis, AAC and Opus Video coding formats include H.264, HEVC, VP8 and VP9 Encoded audio and video streams are assembled in a container bitstream such as MP4, FLV, WebM, ASF or ISMA The bitstream is delivered from a streaming server to a streaming client (e.g., the computer user with their Internet-connected laptop) using a transport protocol, such as Adobe's RTMP or RTP.\n\n\nRecording\nMedia that is livestreamed can be recorded through certain media players, such as VLC player, or through the use of a screen recorder Live-streaming platforms such as Twitch may also incorporate a video on demand system that allows automatic recording of live broadcasts so that they can be watched later [74] YouTube also has recordings of live broadcasts, including television shows aired on major networks These streams have the potential to be recorded by anyone who has access to them, whether legally or otherwise [75]\n\n\nView recommendation\nMost streaming services feature a recommender system for viewing based on each user's view history in conjunction with all viewers' aggregated view histories Rather than focusing on subjective categorization of content by content curators), there is an assumption that, with the immensity of data collected on viewing habits, the choices of those who are first to view content can be algorithmically extrapolated to the totality of the user base, with increasing probabilistic accuracy as to the likelihood of their choosing and enjoying the recommended content as more data is collected [76]\n\n\nApplications and marketing\nUseful and typical applications of streaming are, for example, long video lectures performed online [77] An advantage of this presentation is that these lectures can be very long, although they can always be interrupted or repeated at arbitrary places Streaming enables new content marketing concepts For example, the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra sells Internet live streams of whole concerts instead of several CDs or similar fixed media in their Digital Concert Hall [78] using YouTube for trailers These online concerts are also spread over a lot of different places, including cinemas at various places on the globe A similar concept is used by the Metropolitan Opera in New York There is also a livestream from the International Space Station [79] [80] In video entertainment, video streaming platforms like Netflix, Hulu, and Disney+ are mainstream elements of the media industry [81]\n\n\nChallenges\nFor over-the-top media service (OTT) platforms, the original content captures additional subscribers [86] This presents copyright issues and the potential for international exploitation through streaming, [87] widespread use of standards, and metadata in digital files [88] The WIPO has indicated several basic copyright issues arising for those pursuing work in the film [89] [90] and music industries [91] in the era of streaming.\n\n\nCopyright issues\nFor over-the-top media service (OTT) platforms, the original content captures additional subscribers [86] This

{"title": "Rogue_wave", "content": "\nBackground\nRogue waves are waves in open water that are much larger than surrounding waves More precisely, rogue waves have a height which is more than twice the significant wave height (Hs or SWH) They can be caused when currents or winds cause waves to travel at different speeds, and the waves merge to create a single large wave; or when nonlinear effects cause energy to move between waves to create a single extremely large wave.\n\n\nHistory of rogue wave knowledge\nIn 1826, French scientist and naval officer Jules Dumont d'Urville reported waves as high as 33 m (108 ft) in the Indian Ocean with three colleagues as witnesses, yet he was publicly ridiculed by fellow scientist François Arago In that era, the thought was widely held that no wave could exceed 9 m (30 ft) [18] [19] Author Susan Casey wrote that much of that disbelief came because there were very few people who had seen a rogue wave and survived; until the advent of steel double-hulled ships of the 20th century, \"people who encountered 100-foot  [30 m] rogue waves generally weren't coming back to tell people about it.\" [20]\n\n\nEarly reports\nIn 1826, French

people about it.\" [20]\n\n\nPre-1995 research\nUnusual waves have been studied scientifically for many years (for example, John Scott Russell's wave of translation, an 1834 study of a soliton wave) Still, these were not linked conceptually to sailors' stories of encounters with giant rogue ocean waves, as the latter were believed to be scientifically implausible.\n\n\nResearch on cross-swell waves and their contribution to rogue wave studies\nBefore the Draupner wave was recorded in 1995, early research had already made significant strides in understanding extreme wave interactions In 1979, Dik Ludikhuize and Henk Jan Verhagen at TU Delft successfully generated cross-swell waves in a wave basin Although only monochromatic waves could be produced at the time, their findings, reported in 1981, showed that individual wave heights could be added together even when exceeding breaker criteria This phenomenon provided early evidence that waves could grow significantly larger than anticipated by conventional theories of wave breaking [26]\n\n\nThe 1995 Draupner wave\nThe Draupner wave (or New Year's wave) was the first rogue wave to be detected by a measuring instrument The wave was recorded in 1995 at Unit E of the Draupner platform, a gas pipeline support complex located in the North Sea about 160 km (100 miles) southwest from the southern tip of Norway [29] [a]\n\n\nSubsequent research\nFollowing the evidence of the Draupner wave, research in the area became widespread.\n\n\nExtreme rogue wave events\nOn 17 November 2020, a buoy moored in 45 metres (148 ft) of water on Amphitrite Bank in the Pacific Ocean 7 kilometres (4.3 mi; 3.8 nmi) off Ucluelet, Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada, at 48°54′N 125°36′W﻿ / ﻿48.9°N 125.6°W﻿ / 48.9; -125.6 recorded a lone 17.6-metre (58 ft) tall wave among surrounding waves about 6 metres (20 ft) in height [50] The wave exceeded the surrounding significant wave heights by a factor of 2.93 When the wave's detection was revealed to the public in February 2022, one scientific paper [50] and many news outlets christened the event as \"the most extreme rogue wave event ever recorded\" and a \"once-in-a-millennium\" event, claiming that at about three times the height of the waves around it, the Ucluelet wave set a record as the most extreme rogue wave ever recorded at the time in terms of its height in proportion to surrounding waves, and that a wave three times the height of those around it was estimated to occur on average only once every 1,300 years worldwide [51] [52] [53]\n\n\nCauses\nBecause the phenomenon of rogue waves is still a matter of active research, clearly stating what the most common causes are or whether they vary from place to place is premature The areas of highest predictable risk appear to be where a strong current runs counter to the primary direction of travel of the waves; the area near Cape Agulhas off the southern tip of Africa is one such area The warm Agulhas Current runs to the southwest, while the dominant winds are westerlies, but since this thesis does not explain the existence of all waves that have been detected, several different mechanisms are likely, with localized variation Suggested mechanisms for freak waves include:\n\n\nResearch efforts\nA number of research programmes are currently underway or have concluded whose focus is/was on rogue waves, including:\n\n\nOther media\nResearchers at UCLA observed rogue-wave phenomena in microstructured optical fibers near the threshold of soliton supercontinuum generation and characterized the initial conditions for generating rogue waves in any medium [95] Research in optics has pointed out the role played by a Peregrine soliton that may explain those waves that appear and disappear without leaving a trace [96] [97]\n\n\nReported encounters\nMany of these encounters are reported only in the media, and are not examples of open-ocean rogue waves Often, in popular culture, an endangering huge wave is loosely denoted as a \"rogue wave\", while the case has not been established that the reported event is a rogue wave in the scientific sense – i.e of a very different nature in characteristics as the surrounding waves in that sea state] and with a very low probability of occurrence.\n\n\n19th century\nThe loss of the MS München in 1978 provided some of the first physical evidence of the existence of rogue waves München was a state-of-the-art cargo ship with multiple water-tight compartments and an expert crew She was lost with all crew, and the wreck has never been found The only evidence found was the starboard lifeboat recovered from floating wreckage sometime later The lifeboats hung from forward and aft blocks 20 m (66 ft) above the waterline The pins had been bent back from forward to aft, indicating the lifeboat hanging below it had been struck by a wave that had run from fore to aft of the ship and had torn the lifeboat from the ship To exert such force, the wave must have been considerably higher than 20 m (66 ft) At the time of the inquiry, the existence of rogue waves was considered so statistically unlikely as to be near impossible Consequently, the Maritime Court investigation concluded that the severe weather had somehow created an \"unusual event\" that had led to the sinking of the München [15]

bulk carriers of 150 m (490 ft) and upwards The bulkhead and double bottom must be strong enough to allow the ship to survive flooding in hold one unless loading is restricted [134]\n\n\nSee

Waves**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nRogue waves, also known as freak waves, are unusually large and unpredictable waves that can occur in open water. These waves can be much taller than the surrounding waves, and can be a significant threat to ships and coastal communities. Despite their unpredictability, rogue waves have been studied extensively, and researchers have made significant progress in understanding their causes and characteristics.\n\n**Background**\n\nRogue waves are waves in open water that are much larger than surrounding waves.

Researchers began to study the causes and characteristics of rogue waves, and developed new theories to explain their behavior.

predictable risk appear to be where a strong current runs counter to the primary direction of travel of the waves; the area near Cape Agulhas off the southern tip of Africa is one such area The warm Agulhas Current runs to the southwest, while the dominant winds are westerlies, but since this thesis does not explain the existence of all waves that have been detected, several different mechanisms are likely, with localized variation Suggested mechanisms for freak waves include:\n\n\nResearch efforts\nA number of research programmes are currently underway or have concluded whose focus is/was on rogue waves, including:\n\n\nOther media\nResearchers at UCLA observed rogue-wave phenomena in microstructured optical fibers near the threshold of soliton supercontinuum generation and characterized the initial conditions for generating rogue waves in any medium [95] Research in optics has pointed out the role played by a Peregrine soliton that may explain those waves that appear and disappear without leaving a trace [96] [97]\n\n\nReported encounters\nMany of these encounters are reported only in the media, and are not examples of open-ocean rogue waves Often, in popular culture, an endangering huge wave is loosely denoted as a \"rogue wave\", while the case has not been established that the reported event is a rogue wave in the scientific sense – i.e of a very different nature in characteristics as the surrounding waves in that sea state] and with a very low probability of occurrence.\n\n\n19th century\nThe loss of the MS München in 1978 provided some of the first physical evidence of the existence of rogue waves München was a state-of-the-art cargo ship with multiple water-tight compartments and an expert crew She was lost with all crew, and the wreck has never been found The only evidence found was the starboard lifeboat recovered from floating wreckage sometime later The lifeboats hung from forward and aft blocks 20 m (66 ft) above the waterline The pins had been bent back from forward to aft, indicating the lifeboat hanging below it had been struck by a wave that had run from fore to aft of the ship and had torn the lifeboat from the ship To exert such force, the wave must have been considerably higher than 20 m (66 ft) At the time of the inquiry, the existence of rogue waves was considered so statistically unlikely as to be near impossible Consequently, the Maritime Court investigation concluded that the severe weather had somehow created an \"unusual event\" that had led to the sinking of the München [15] [128]\n\n\n20th century\nThe

{"title": "Israel–Hamas_war", "content": "\nBackground\nThe 1948 Palestine war saw the establishment of Israel over most of what had been Mandatory Palestine, with the exception of two separated territories that became known as the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, which were held by Jordan and Egypt respectively Following the 1967 Six-Day War, Israel occupied the Palestinian territories of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip [138] The upcoming period witnessed two popular uprisings by Palestinians against the Israeli occupation; the First and Second Intifadas in 1987 and 2000 respectively, [169] with the latter's end seeing Israel's unilateral withdrawal from Gaza in 2005 [170] [171]\n\n\nEvents\nThe attacks took place during the Jewish holidays of Simchat Torah and Shemini Atzeret on Shabbat, [201] and one day after the 50th anniversary of the start of the Yom Kippur War, which also began with a surprise attack on Israel [194] At around 6:30 a.m IDT (UTC+03:00) on 7 October 2023, [202] Hamas announced the start of what it called \"Operation Al-Aqsa Flood\", stating it had fired over 5,000 rockets from the Gaza Strip into Israel within a span of 20 minutes Israeli sources reported that at least 3,000 projectiles had been launched from Gaza At least five people were killed by the rocket attacks [203] [204] [205] Explosions were reported in areas surrounding the strip and in cities in the Sharon plain including Gedera, Herzliya, [206] Tel Aviv, and Ashkelon [207]\n\n\n7 October attacks\nThe attacks took place during the Jewish holidays of Simchat Torah and Shemini Atzeret on Shabbat, [201] and one day after the 50th anniversary of the start of the Yom Kippur War, which also began with a surprise attack on Israel [194] At around 6:30 a.m IDT (UTC+03:00) on 7 October 2023, [202] Hamas announced the start of what it called \"Operation Al-Aqsa Flood\", stating it had fired over 5,000 rockets from the Gaza Strip into Israel within a span of 20 minutes Israeli sources reported that at least 3,000 projectiles had been launched from Gaza At least five people were killed by the rocket attacks [203] [204] [205] Explosions were reported in areas surrounding the strip and in cities in the Sharon plain including Gedera, Herzliya, [206] Tel Aviv, and Ashkelon [207]\n\n\nInitial Israeli counter-operation (October 2023)\nAfter the initial breach of the Gaza perimeter by Palestinian militants, it took hours for the IDF to start its counter-attack [231] The first helicopters sent to support the military were launched from the north of Israel, and arrived at the Gaza Strip an hour after fighting began [220] They immediately encountered difficulty in determining which outposts and communities were occupied, and distinguishing between Palestinian militants and the soldiers and civilians on the ground [220] The helicopter crews initially sustained a high rate of fire, attacking approximately 300 targets in four hours Later on the crews began to slow down the attacks and carefully select targets [220] According to Haaretz's journalist Josh Breiner, a police source said that a police investigation indicated an IDF helicopter which had fired on Hamas militants \"apparently also hit some festival participants\" in the Re'im music festival massacre [219] The Israeli police denied the Haaretz report [232]\n\n\nIsraeli blockade and bombardment\nFollowing the surprise attack, the Israeli Air Force conducted airstrikes that they said targeted Hamas compounds, command centers, tunnels, and other targets [204] [241] [248] Israel employed its artificial intelligence Habsora (\"The Gospel\") software with a new and superior capacity to automatically generate targets to be attacked [249] [250] Two days after the surprise attack, Israel said that 426 Hamas targets had been hit, including destroying Beit Hanoun, homes of Hamas officials, a mosque, and an internet hub [248] [251] [252] Israel also rescued two hostages before declaring a state of war for the first time since the 1973 Yom Kippur War [253] [254]\n\n\nEvacuation of Northern Gaza\nAlmost a week after the initial attack on Israel, on 13 October, the IDF called the evacuation of all civilians of Gaza City to the area south of the Wadi Gaza [263] All Palestinians in that region, including those in Gaza City, were given 24 hours to evacuate to the south The Hamas Authority for Refugee Affairs responded by telling residents in northern Gaza to \"remain steadfast in your homes and stand firm in the face of this disgusting psychological war waged by the occupation\" [264] The statement by Israel faced widespread backlash; with numerous agencies, such as Doctors Without Borders, the World Health Organization, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, among others, condemning the order as \"outrageous\" and \"impossible\" while calling for an immediate reversal of the order [265]\n\n\n17 October\nOn 17 October, Israel bombed in areas of southern Gaza [275] Ministry of Health officials in Gaza reported heavy overnight bombing killing over 70 people, including families who had evacuated from Gaza City in the north [276] One of the airstrikes killed a senior Hamas military commander Ayman Nofal [277] In the afternoon, an Israeli strike hit a UNRWA school in the Al-Maghazi refugee camp, killing six and injuring 12 [278] Late in the evening, an explosion occurred in the parking lot of the Al-Ahli Arabi Baptist Hospital in the center of Gaza City, killing hundreds The cause of the explosion was disputed by Hamas and the IDF, and the ongoing conflict prevented independent on-site analysis [279] Palestinian statements that it was an Israeli airstrike were denied by the IDF, which stated that the explosion resulted from a failed rocket launch by Palestinian Islamic Jihad [280] The PIJ denied any involvement [281] [282]\n\n\nInvasion of the Gaza Strip until the truce (October–November 2023)\nOn 27 October, the IDF launched a large-scale, multi-pronged ground incursion into parts of northern Gaza The IDF was building up a force of over 100,000 soldiers in the cities of Ashkelon, Sderot and Kiryat Gat Clashes between Hamas and the IDF were reported near Beit Hanoun and Bureij [294] [295] Israeli airstrikes targeted the area around the al-Quds hospital, [296] where around 14,000 civilians were believed to be sheltering in or near the hospital [296] Associated Press reported that Israeli airstrikes also destroyed roads leading to the Al-Shifa hospital, making it increasingly difficult to reach [297] The following day, the IDF struck at densely-populated Jabalia refugee camp, killing 50 and wounding 150 Palestinians according to the Gaza Health Ministry According to Israel, a senior Hamas commander and dozens of militants in a vast underground tunnel complex were among those killed Hamas denied the presence of a senior commander on the scene [298] [299] [300] The nearby Indonesia Hospital's surgical director said they had received 120 dead bodies and treated 280 wounded, the majority of them women and children [301] The attack resulted in several ambassador recalls [302] [303] [304] According to The New York Times at least two 2,000-pound bombs, the second largest type in Israel's arsenal, were used [305]\n\n\nDuration of the truce (November–December 2023)\nFollowing the introduction of a Qatari-brokered truce on 24 November, starting at 7:00 am Israel time, active fighting in the Gaza Strip ceased and some of the Israeli and foreign hostages were released by Hamas in exchange for the release of some of the Palestinian political prisoners held by Israel The truce was announced for a period of four days but was extended for a longer period.\n\n\nResumption of hostilities (December 2023 – May 2024)\nThe truce expired on 1 December, as Israel and Hamas blamed each other for failing to agree on an extension The disagreement centered on \"how to define soldiers versus civilians and how many Palestinian prisoners Israel would release for its hostages\" [323] The remaining Israeli hostages include a year old baby, his 4-year-old brother and their mother, 13 women aged 18–39, and 85 men, some over 80 [324] Thousands of Palestinians remain in administrative detention [325] A Hamas official said that after the exchange, the only remaining hostages were \"soldiers and civilian men who served in the occupation army\", and refused to exchange them until \"all our prisoners are freed and a ceasefire takes hold\" [326] US National Security Advisor Kirby said \"Hamas agreed to allow the Red Cross access to these hostages while the pause was in place\", which \"didn't happen and is still not happening\" [327] The Palestinian Prisoners' Club said 240 Palestinian prisoners were released as part of the ceasefire deal, another 240 Palestinians were incarcerated Released Palestinian prisoners reported mistreatment including beatings, overcrowding, food deprivation, and suspension of access to the Red Cross [328] Released prisoners were forbidden to speak with the media and threatened with fines [325]\n\n\nContinuation of operations in Northern Gaza (December 2023 – January 2024)\nThe truce expired on 1 December, as Israel and Hamas blamed each other for failing to agree on an extension The disagreement centered on \"how to define soldiers versus civilians and how many Palestinian prisoners Israel would release for its hostages\" [323] The remaining Israeli hostages include a year old baby, his 4-year-old brother and their mother, 13 women aged 18–39, and 85 men, some over 80 [324] Thousands of Palestinians remain in administrative detention [325] A Hamas official said that after the exchange, the only

beatings, overcrowding, food deprivation, and suspension of access to the Red Cross [328] Released prisoners were forbidden to speak with the media and threatened with fines [325]\n\n\nAdvance into Central Gaza (December 2023 – February 2024)\nThe IDF reported its troops had reached the centers of Khan Yunis, Jabalia, and Shuja'iyya reporting the most \"intense fighting\" since the invasion of Gaza began [341] Intensified bombing pushed Palestinian civilians south to Rafah [342] On 7 December, Israel detained 150 men in the Gaza Strip, with dozens more detained on 10 December According to Israel, the detentions followed a mass surrender of Hamas militants [343] [344] The New York Times reported that the statement about Hamas fighters surrendering was made after video and photos of \"men stripped to their underwear, sitting or kneeling on the ground, with some bound and blindfolded\" were seen on social media [345]The Guardian reported that among those in the images were civilians, including a journalist The ICRC said it was concerned and strongly emphasized \"the importance of treating all those detained with humanity and dignity, in accordance with international humanitarian law\" [346] The BBC reported that a video of the apparent surrender of weapons was unclear on whether a man is \"surrendering\" weapons, or just moving them as instructed, suggesting it was performed for the camera, rather than authentic surrender, and it is unknown if the individuals are involved with Hamas, or the 7 October attack [347] Haaretz reported that Israel believed about 10% of the people shown in the video were affiliated with Hamas, and despite public statements by Israel, this was not a \"mass surrender\" by Hamas [348] Amnesty International described the treatment of those detained on 7 December as a violation of international law [349]\n\n\nWithdrawal from Northern Gaza (January–February 2024)\nOn 1 January 2024, Israel withdrew from neighborhoods in North Gaza [356] On 7 January, the IDF conducted a targeted missile strike on a car carrying Al Jazeera journalists Hamza Dadouh and Mustafa Thuraya; they and their driver were killed [357]\n\n\nPreparations for the attack on Rafah (February–March 2024)\nDuring February to early May 2024, Israeli preparations to invade Rafah became a dominant issue in public rhetoric made by Israeli officials In February, Israel stated its next objective would be the capture of Rafah On 12 February, Israel started the bombing campaign on Rafah [371] On 5 February, Israeli gunboats shelled a clearly marked UNRWA convoy, forcing UNRWA to suspend its operations for almost 3 weeks, affecting 200,000 people [316] On 15 February, The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times reported that Egypt was building a refugee camp for over 100,000 people south of Rafah, surrounded by five-meter-high concrete walls [372] [373] However, the governor of North Sinai Governorate, Mohamed Abdel-Fadil Shousha, denied these rumors in a statement published by Al Arabiya [374] On 18 February, Israeli war cabinet member Benny Gantz warned that a ground offensive would be launched in Rafah on 10 March unless Hamas freed all hostages Gantz added Israel would act in \"a co-ordinated manner, facilitating the evacuation of civilians in dialogue with our American and Egyptian partners to minimise civilian casualties\" [375] On 20 February 2 family members of MSF staff were killed when Israel shelled a clearly marked MSF shelter [316]\n\n\nSecond raid on al-Shifa Hospital and withdrawal from southern Gaza (March–April 2024)\nIsraeli forces raided al-Shifa hospital again between 18 March and 1 April The IDF clashed with Hamas in the area [383] Israeli forces killed Faiq al-Mabhouh, who they said was head of the operations directorate of Hamas' internal security service Hamas said al-Mabhouh was in charge of civil law enforcement and had been engaged in \"purely civil and humanitarian activity,\" [384] coordinating aid deliveries to north Gaza [385] [386] News agencies reported that the IDF assaulted and detained Al-Jazeera correspondent Ismail al-Ghoul and more than 80 others, including medical staff and other journalists, and confiscated and destroyed media equipment [387] [388] Al-Ghoul was released the following day, but could not verify the whereabouts of his colleagues [389] [390] The Committee to Protect Journalists said it was \"deeply alarmed and outraged by reports of the assault of Ismail Al-Ghoul and other journalists while reporting on the Israeli offensive on the hospital\" [390]\n\n\nBeginning of the Rafah offensive (May–July 2024)\nOn 6 May, the IDF ordered civilians in eastern Rafah to evacuate to Al-Mawasi, west of Khan Yunis, affecting about 100,000 people [415] Later that day, Hamas announced that it had accepted the terms of a ceasefire brokered by Egypt and Qatar [416] The deal included a 6-week ceasefire and exchange of prisoners [417] However, Israel rejected this deal [418] Israel responded that the terms Hamas had accepted were \"far from Israel's basic requirements\", but that it would send a delegation to further negotiate \"to exhaust the possibility of reaching an agreement under conditions acceptable to Israel\", while the military operation on Rafah would continue in the meantime to \"exert military pressure on Hamas\" [419] [420]\n\n\nContinued operations throughout Gaza (July 2024 – present)\nOn 13 July, at least 90 people were killed and 300 were injured in an Israeli strike on Al-Mawasi and 22 people were killed in an Israeli strike targeting people gathered to pray near the ruins of a mosque in the Al-Shati refugee camp [454] [455] [456] On 15 July, Israeli air raids destroyed the UNRWA's Gaza headquarters [457] Israeli forces destroyed the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital, prompting calls for an investigation from the Turkish government [458] On 31 July, Al Jazeera journalist Ismail al-Ghoul and his cameraman were killed in a targeted strike in the west of Gaza City They were reporting on the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, which occurred earlier that day, from the area near his home in Gaza [459] Hamas official Rawhi Mushtaha was killed alongside two other Hamas officials in an Israeli airstrike [460] [461] On 1 August, three Israeli missiles

of militant sites [486]\n\n\nPolio vaccination campaign\nOn 16 August, a 10-month-old contracted Gaza's first case of polio in 25 years [487] On 30 August, Israel and Hamas agreed to pause fighting in central Gaza for three days, then in southern Gaza for three days and then in northern Gaza for three days from 6:00 a.m to 3:00 p.m in a designated area for polio vaccination starting on 31 August Israel and Hamas also agreed to extend pause in fighting in three separate zones to the fourth day if needed [488] [489] On 4 September, World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that vaccinations would continue at \"four fixed sites in central Gaza for three more days\" [490] On 6 September, the Gaza Health Ministry said that Israel was hindering polio vaccinations by refusing to coordinate the entry of medical teams into the southern Gaza Strip [491] On 8 September, the Gaza Health Ministry extended polio vaccination in southern Gaza for one more day [492] On 9 September, UN staff working with the polio vaccination campaign were detained by Israeli soldiers in northern Gaza, who held them at gunpoint and damaged UN vehicles with bulldozers Because of this incident, UNRWA commissioner Philippe Lazzarini said that the future of the UN's vaccination program in northern Gaza was uncertain [493] On 16 September, Lazzarini said that first phase of polio vaccination was a success and it reached 90% of the children [494] On 12 October, a humanitarian pause between the IDF and Hamas started in the designated protected zone for polio vaccination campaign for children [495] The World Health Organization announced that second phase of the polio vaccination campaign was launched in central Gaza [496] [497] Strikes on the Mufti school

Jabalia on that day [558]\n\n\nKilling of Yahya Sinwar\nOn 16 October, IDF ground forces killed Yahya Sinwar in a shootout in Tal as-Sultan [559] The conscript soldiers who participated in the shootout were not initially aware that one of the militants they had killed was Sinwar, and he was identified the following day by his dental records [560] Sinwar's death while participating in ground battles alongside a small group of militants ran counter to the Israeli defense establishment's assumptions that he would be hiding underground, surrounded by hostages There were no hostages in Sinwar's vicinity at the time of his death, [561] and no civilian casualties were reported [562] Joe Biden urged Israel to end the war citing victory as a result of Sinwar's death [563]\n\n\nGenerals' plan\nOn 13 October, senior IDF officials told Haaretz that the government was not seeking to revive hostage talks and that political leadership was pushing for the annexation of parts of the Gaza Strip [564] In the later weeks of October, Israel's siege on North Gaza intensified and daily aid shipments dropped significantly Eyewitnesses reported the shelling of hospitals, razing of shelters, and abductions of men and boys by the Israeli military, leading to speculation that Israel had decided to implement a plan by a group of retired generals to turn the northern Strip into a closed military zone and declare all who refuse to leave as combatants [565]  On 18 October, an Israeli air strike on several houses in the vicinity of the Nassar Junction in Jabalia refugee camp killed 33 people, injured 85 others and trapped several others under the rubble [566] [567] [568] On 19 October, Israel bombed al-Awda Hospital in Jabalia and Kamal Adwan and the Indonesian hospitals in Beit

buildings in the al-Hawja residential area inside the Jabalia refugee camp According to an assessment by Gaza Civil Defense, 150 people were either killed or injured [576] On 25 October, Gaza Civil Defense said that an Israeli drone strike on a group of Palestinians receiving aid near Shati refugee camp killed 12 people [577] The WHO said it had lost contact with Kamal Adwan hospital that night, and UN human rights chief Volker Türk called recent developments in North Gaza the \"darkest moment\" in the war so far In his statement, Türk invoked the international obligation to prevent genocide, marking a departure from UN hesitancy to use that word regarding the war [578] On 26 October, an Israeli strike on a residential area in Beit Lahia killed at least 35 Palestinians [579] On 27 October, Israeli forces bombed a building that housed displaced people in Beit Lahia, killing ten people [580] An Israeli airstrike on the UN-run Asmaa school sheltering displaced families in Al-Shati refugee camp killed at least 11 people and injured several others [581] [582] [583]\n\n\nOther confrontations\nHezbollah in southern Lebanon and the Houthi movement in Yemen have launched limited attacks against Israel, raising fears of a wider regional military conflict Iranian-backed militias in Iraq and Syria have also traded attacks with the US and IDF [584] Israel has bombed targets in and around Damascus throughout the war, [585] [586] [587] with an attack on the Iranian embassy in Damascus on 1 April leading to a direct Iranian response [588] Iran launched a series of retaliatory airstrikes on Israel [588] [589] Over 100 Palestinians have been killed in confrontations with Israeli soldiers and settlers in the West Bank since 7 October Settler violence has been heavily criticized by the IDF [590] [591]\n\n\nWest Bank and Israel\nAmnesty International released a report [592] on 5 February 2024 stating that Israel is carrying out unlawful killings in the West Bank and displaying \"a chilling disregard for Palestinian lives\" and that Israeli forces are carrying out numerous illegal acts of violence that constitute clear violations of international law [593] [594]\n\n\nIsraeli settlements\nIsraeli settlers have taken advantage of the ongoing war to expand settlement activity supported by a far-right Israeli government, [631] [597] [632] including land seizure and large scale settlement plans [633] In 2024, Israeli land seizures exceeded the combined total of the previous 20 years [634]\n\n\nAttacks in Israel\nDuring the war, civilians in Israel have been subjected to intermittent killings and other violent actions For example, on 30 November, two Palestinian gunmen killed three and wounded eleven Israeli civilians at a bus stop on the Givat Shaul Interchange in Jerusalem Hamas claimed responsibility [635] On 16 February 2024, a Palestinian gunman shot and killed two Israeli civilians and injured four others in Kiryat Malakhi, Israel The shooter was killed by an off-duty IDF reservist at the scene [636] On 12 April 2024 a 14-old Israeli shepherd was killed and on 16 April 2024 two Palestinians were killed by Israeli settlers in Aqraba [637] On 13 May, at the Tarqumiya checkpoint, a convoy of trucks carrying food supplies to Gaza was attacked by Israeli settlers, who damaged the trucks and threw supplies on the ground [638]\n\n\nIsraeli prisons and detention camps\nIsrael has dramatically increased its use of administrative detention against Palestinians from both the West Bank and Gaza, as well as Palestinian citizens of Israel, since the start of the war Administrative detention was already at a 20-year high before October 2023 [639] At least 60 Palestinians have died in Israeli detention since 7 October [640]\n\n\nLebanon\nA series of border clashes with Hezbollah along the Israel–Lebanon border began shortly after the 7 October attack In 2024, Israel escalated its assault on Lebanon, carrying out explosive device attacks, assassinations of Hezbollah and Hamas leaders, and expanding its bombing campaign On 1 October, Israel began a ground invasion of Lebanon More than 2,500 people have been killed and 20% of Lebanon's population has been displaced [649]\n\n\nClashes\nOn 8 October, Hezbollah launched an artillery attack on Israeli positions in Shebaa Farms; this was met with immediate retaliation [650] [651]

as well as over 294 Lebanese civilians, more than 25 Syrian civilians and over 27 Israeli civilians, [653] [654] one Lebanese Army soldier, [655] and the displacement of more than 500,000 people in Lebanon and over 96,000 more in Israel [656] [657] On 13 October, Reuters journalist Issam Abdullah was killed by Israeli tank fire while reporting on the border skirmishes [658] The inability of Israelis to return to settlements and homes in the north of the country led to Antony Blinken stating that Israel had effectively \"lost sovereignty in the northern quadrant of its country\" [659] On 27 July 2024, the Majdal Shams attack occurred, killing 12 children in the Golan Heights area [660] [661] The attack, which was carried out by Hezbollah according to Israel and the US, marked an escalation in hostilities and opened discussion about a broader war with Lebanon Hezbollah denied responsibility for the attack [662]\n\n\nEscalation\nWhile the Biden administration publicly urged Israel to reach a negotiated solution with Hezbollah, senior white house officials including Amos Hochstein and Brett McGurk privately assured Israel that the US backed its decision to escalate militarily [663] On 17 September 2024, at least 12 people were killed and thousands of others including Hezbollah members and civilians were wounded across Lebanon and Syria following multiple explosions blamed on pagers used by Hezbollah to prevent their members being targeted by mobile phone signals Among those reported injured was the Iranian ambassador to Lebanon, Mojtaba Amani [664]

injure any of the crew [769]\n\n\nIranian strikes on Israel\nOn 13 April, following an Israeli airstrike on its consulate building in Damascus, Syria on 1 April, [775] Iran launched Operation True Promise, [776] a series of retaliatory airstrikes on Israel, [588] [589] attacking the country from Iranian soil for the first time [777]\n\n\nIsraeli response\nOn 12 October, the United States authorized the deployment of THAAD missile defense systems and American crews to man them to Israel in anticipation of an Iranian response to the planned Israeli retaliation for Iran's 1 October strikes [781] [782] Massive cyberattacks were reported on nuclear facilities and government agencies of Iran [783] Leaked US intelligence documents revealed that Israel was conducting covert drone operations over Iran in preparation for a strike The documents also showed that the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency was monitoring Israeli weapons movements, ground forces, air defenses, navy, air and special forces, and nuclear weapons, but that it lacked the intelligence to anticipate an Israeli strike US intelligence did not find any indication that Israel was planning to use nuclear weapons in its response [784] [785] On 23 October, Gholamreza Jalali, the head of Iran's National Organization for Passive Defense said that Israeli cyberattacks against Iranian interests are continuing, but they are facing a \"layer-by-layer\" defence strategy that have kept them at bay [786] On 24 October, IRGC chief Hossein Salami claimed that THAAD systems will not be enough if Israel

the Israel–Hamas war, including 131-143 journalists and media workers (123-130 Palestinian, 2-4 Israeli, 6-8 Lebanese and 1 Syrian) according to Committee to Protect Journalists and International Federation of Journalists [799] [800], 120 academics [801] and over 224 humanitarian aid workers, including 179 employees of UNRWA [802]\n\n\nHumanitarian crisis\nThe Gaza Strip is experiencing a humanitarian crisis as a result of the Israel–Hamas war [819] [820] The crisis includes both a famine and a healthcare collapse At the start of the war, Israel tightened its blockade on the Gaza Strip, which has resulted in significant shortages of fuel, food, medication, water, and essential medical supplies [819] [821] [822] This siege resulted in a 90% drop in electricity availability, impacting hospital power supplies, sewage plants, and shutting down the desalination plants that provide drinking water [823] Widespread disease outbreaks have spread across Gaza [820]\n\n\nScale of destruction\nThe scale, extent, and pace of destruction of buildings in the Gaza Strip ranks among the most severe in modern history, [842] [843] [844] surpassing the bombing of Dresden, Hamburg, and London combined during World War II [845] [846] [847] The 29,000 munitions – shells and bombs – that Israel had dropped on Gaza in three months greatly exceed the amount (3,678) dropped by the United States between 2004 and 2010 after its invasion of Iraq [848] After a year, the UN estimates that a total of 42m tonnes of rubble clutter the Strip, to clear and rebuilt which might take 80 years, and cost over $80bn [849] An earlier estimate worked out that 300 kilograms of rubble on average existed per square metre of Gaza [850] The estimated extent of the destruction ranges from 35% of all buildings (March 2024, UNITAR) [851] [852] to 70% (December 2023, The Wall Street Journal), [847] with a higher level of destruction in northern Gaza [853] [854] The damage to buildings in northern Gaza reportedly exceeds that in Bakhmut and Mariupol in the Russian invasion of Ukraine, [846] Aleppo in the Battle of Aleppo, [842] and Mosul and Raqqa in the War against the Islamic State; [842] by 5 December 2023, the percentage of buildings damaged or destroyed in Gaza exceeded Dresden and Cologne during World War II and approached the level of destruction seen in Hamburg [846] [855] Bombing has destroyed or damaged apartment buildings, hospitals, schools, religious sites, factories, and shopping centers [847] The Guardian reported that the scale of destruction has led international legal experts to raise the concept of domicide, which it describes as \"the mass destruction of dwellings to make  [a] territory uninhabitable\" [843]\n\n\nWar crimes\nA UN Commission to the Israel–Palestine conflict stated that there is \"clear evidence that war crimes may have been committed in the latest explosion of violence in Israel and Gaza, and all those who have violated international law and targeted civilians must be held accountable.\" [856] [857] [858] On 27 October, a spokesperson for the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) called for an independent court to review potential war crimes committed by both sides [859]\n\n\nDiplomatic impact\nThe war sparked a major diplomatic crisis, with many countries around the world reacting strongly to the conflict that affected the momentum of regional relations [878] At least nine countries took the drastic step of recalling their ambassadors and cutting diplomatic ties with Israel [879] [880] The war has also resulted in a renewed focus on a two-state solution to the broader conflict [881] [882] Global public opinion of Israel has dropped during the war as well; a Morning Consult poll published in January 2024 indicated that the United States was the only remaining wealthy country in which Israel had net positive approval [883]\n\n\nReactions\nThe Israeli government's response to the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel has multiple aspects, including a military response leading to the Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip In October, the Knesset approved a war cabinet in Israel, adding National Unity ministers and altering the government; Benjamin Netanyahu and Benny Gantz froze non-war legislation, establishing a war cabinet with military authority.\n\n\nIsrael\nThe Israeli government's response to the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel has multiple aspects, including a military response leading to the Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip In October, the Knesset approved a war cabinet in Israel, adding National Unity ministers and altering the government; Benjamin Netanyahu and Benny Gantz froze non-war legislation, establishing a war cabinet with military authority.\n\n\nPalestinian territories\nInitially, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas asserted the Palestinian people's right to self-defense against the \"terror of settlers and occupation troops\" [899] and condemned the orders by Israel for residents to evacuate north Gaza, labeling it a \"second Nakba\" [900] Later, Abbas rejected the killing of civilians on both sides, and said that the Palestinian Liberation Organization was the sole representative of the Palestinian people [901]\n\n\nInternational\nSignificant geopolitical divisions emerged during the war Much of the Western world provided strong diplomatic and military support to Israel, [902] including the United States, [903] United Kingdom, [904] and Germany [905] although the strong support is \"at odds with the attitudes of Western publics which continue to shift away from Israel\", according to Hugh Lovatt, a senior policy fellow with the Middle East and North Africa Programme at the European Council on Foreign Relations Lovatt says that during the Cold War, Israel sided with the West against the Arab countries supported by the Soviets, and Western leaders generally see Israel \"as a fellow member of the liberal democratic club\" and that this partially \"explains the continued strong Western support for Israel – which has now largely become reflexive\" [902] At least 44 nations denounced Hamas and explicitly condemned its conduct on 7 October as terrorism, including a joint statement by the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and Germany [906]\n\n\nEvacuations of foreign nationals\nBrazil announced a rescue operation of nationals using an air force transport aircraft [912] Poland announced that it would deploy two C-130 transport planes to evacuate 200 of its nationals [913] Hungary evacuated 215 of its nationals from Israel using two aircraft on 9 October, while Romania evacuated 245 of its citizens, including two pilgrimage groups, on two TAROM planes and two private aircraft on the same day [914] Australia also announced repatriation flights [915] 300 Nigerian pilgrims in Israel fled to Jordan before being airlifted home [916]\n\n\nImpacts\nAccording to Daniel Byman and Alexander Palmer, the attack showcased the decline of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the rise of Hamas as a power center in Palestinian politics They predicted the PLO's further decline if the status quo held [921] Laith Alajlouni wrote that the immediate effect of the Hamas offensive was to unite Hamas and PLO However, it may soon lead to conflict between them, possibly leading the PLO to lose control of the security situation in the West Bank, if more militant groups there begin to launch their independent attacks [922]\n\n\nRegional impact\nAccording to Daniel Byman and Alexander Palmer, the attack showcased the decline of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the rise of Hamas as a power center in Palestinian politics They predicted the PLO's further decline if the status quo held [921] Laith Alajlouni wrote that the immediate effect of the Hamas offensive was to unite Hamas and PLO However, it may soon lead to conflict between them, possibly leading the PLO to lose control of the security situation in the West Bank, if more militant groups there begin to launch their independent attacks [922]\n\n\nEconomic impact\nThe Bank of Israel estimates that by 2025, the war will have cost the country US$67 billion, notwithstanding a $14.5 billion US aid package, part of the $22.76 billion the U.S has so far allocated for military assistance [936] [937]\n\n\nMedia coverage\nIn reporting on the conflict, foreign media such as CNN, ABC, NBC, The New York Times, and Fox News have limited access to Gaza and only in the presence of Israeli soldiers Vox reported that the news organizations \"have to submit all materials and footage to the IDF for review before publication\" [947] The conflict has also seen large numbers of journalists wounded or killed in action On 14 December, CBS reported on a statement from the International Federation of Journalists that \"the number of journalists killed in the past two months in the war in Gaza has surpassed the amount killed in the Vietnam War, which lasted two decades\" [948] Reporters Without Borders filed a complaint with the International Criminal Court under section 8.2.b of the Rome Statute, accusing Israel of committing war crimes against 8 journalists [949] [947] It also lodged a complaint against Hamas, under section 8.2.a of the Rome Statute for the killing of a reporter covering the 7 October attack [949] The Committee to Protect Journalists has accused Israel of targeting journalists reporting from Gaza and their families, saying that in at least two cases, \"journalists reported receiving threats from Israeli officials and Israel Defense Forces officers before their family members were killed\" [950]\n\n\nUse of propaganda\nIn the hours after the attack on 7 October, Hamas \"employed a broad, sophisticated media strategy\" using bot accounts to spread graphic, emotionally charged and false propaganda that was picked up and repeated by official accounts and foreign governments Cyabra, an Israeli social media intelligence company found that on the day after the attack, one in four posts about the conflict on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and X were from fake accounts The New York Times described the start of the Israel–Hamas war as releasing a \"deluge of online propaganda and disinformation\" that was \"larger than anything seen before\" It described the conflict as \"fast becoming a world war online\" and stated that Russia, China, Iran and its proxies had used state media and covert influence campaigns on social media networks to support Hamas, undermine Israel, criticize the United States and cause unrest James Rubin of the U.S State Department's Global Engagement Center called coverage of the conflict as being swept up in \"an undeclared information war with authoritarian countries\" [951]\n\n\nBy Hamas\nIn the hours after the attack on 7 October,

information war with authoritarian countries\" [951]\n\n\nBy Israel\nDuring the conflict, the Israeli government and Israeli cyber companies have deployed AI tools and bot farms to spread disinformation and spread graphic, emotionally charged and false propaganda to dehumanize Palestinians, sow division among supporters of Palestine by targeting Black lawmakers, and exert pressure on politicians to support Israel's actions [952] [953] [954] The Intercept reported that: \"At the center of Israel's information warfare campaign is a tactical mission to dehumanize Palestinians and to flood the public discourse with a stream of false, unsubstantiated, and unverifiable allegations.\" [954] One such covert campaign was commissioned by Israel's Ministry of Diaspora Affairs The ministry allocated about $2 million to the operation, and used political marketing firm Stoic based in Tel Aviv to carry it out, according to officials and documents reviewed by the New York Times The campaign was started after the 7 October attack, and remained active on X (formerly Twitter) at the time of the New York Times report in June 2024 At the peak of the campaign it used hundreds of fake

Israel and the Palestinian Islamist organization Hamas, which has governed the Gaza Strip since 2007. The conflict was sparked by a surprise attack by Hamas on Israel, followed by a large-scale Israeli military operation in Gaza. The war saw significant damage to Gaza, the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people, and the killing of thousands of Palestinians and Israelis alike. The conflict also had significant regional and global implications, with various countries and international organizations weighing in on the issue.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe 1948 Palestine war saw the establishment of Israel over most of what had been Mandatory Palestine, with the exception of two separated territories that became known as the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, which were held by Jordan and Egypt respectively. Following the 1967 Six-Day War, Israel occupied the Palestinian territories of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The upcoming period witnessed two popular uprisings by Palestinians against the Israeli occupation; the First and Second Intifadas in 1987 and 2000 respectively, with the latter's end seeing Israel's unilateral withdrawal from Gaza in 2005.\n\n**Events**\n\nAt around 6:30 a.m. IDT (UTC+03:00) on October 7, 2023, Hamas announced the start of what it called \"Operation Al-Aqsa Flood\", stating it had fired over 5,000 rockets from the Gaza Strip into Israel within a span of 20 minutes. Israeli sources reported that at least 3,000 projectiles had been launched from Gaza. At least five people were killed by the rocket attacks.\n\n**7 October Attacks**\n\nThe attacks took place during the Jewish holidays of Simchat Torah and Shemini Atzeret on Shabbat, with the first day of the attacks falling on Simchat Torah. At least five people were killed by the rocket attacks, with several others reported injured. Explosions were reported in areas surrounding the Gaza Strip and in cities in the Sharon plain, including Gedera, Herzliya, Tel Aviv, and Ashkelon.\n\n**Initial Israeli Counter-Operation (October 2023)**\n\nAfter the initial breach of the Gaza perimeter by Palestinian militants, it took hours for the IDF to start its counter-attack. The first helicopters sent to support the military were launched from the north of Israel, and arrived at the Gaza Strip an hour after fighting began. They immediately encountered difficulty in determining which outposts and communities were occupied, and distinguishing between Palestinian militants and the soldiers and civilians on the ground. The helicopter crews initially sustained a high rate of fire, attacking approximately 300 targets in four hours. Later on, the crews began to slow down the attacks and carefully select targets.\n\n**Israeli Blockade and Bombardment**\n\nFollowing the surprise attack, the Israeli Air Force conducted airstrikes that they said targeted Hamas compounds, command centers, tunnels, and other targets. Israel employed its artificial intelligence Habsora (\"The Gospel\") software with a new and superior capacity to automatically generate targets to be attacked. Two days after the surprise attack, Israel said that 426 Hamas targets had been hit, including destroying Beit Hanoun, homes of Hamas officials, a mosque, and an internet hub. Israel also rescued two hostages before declaring a state of war for the first time since the 1973 Yom Kippur War.\n\n**Evacuation of Northern Gaza (January 2024)**\n\nOn 1 January 2024, Israel withdrew from neighborhoods in North Gaza. On 7 January, the IDF conducted a targeted missile strike on a car carrying Al Jazeera journalists Hamza Dadouh and Mustafa Thuraya; they and their driver were killed. An Israeli airstrike destroyed three houses in the Bekaa Valley killing 11 people.\n\n**Escalation (January 2024 – July 2024)**\n\nThe war saw a significant escalation on 26 September 2024, with the Israeli Air Force conducting over 1,600 strikes in its deadliest attack on Lebanon since 2006, killing at least 558 people and injuring more than 1,835 others including children, women, and paramedics.\n\n**Prelude to Invasion (October 2023 – January 2024)**\n\nOn 1 October 2023, the IDF confirmed that it was conducting a \"limited, localized\" ground operation into southern Lebanon. An Israeli strike on a house in Al-Dawoudiya killed at least 10 people and injured five others.\n\n**Invasion (October 2023)**\n\nOn 1 October, the IDF confirmed that it was conducting a \"limited, localized\" ground operation into southern Lebanon. An Israeli strike on a house in Al-Dawoudiya killed at least 10 people and injured five others.\n\n**Ground Operation in Gaza (October 2023)**\n\nOn 16 October 2023, an Israeli airstrike on the municipal building of Nabatieh killed at least 16 people, including the town's mayor Ahmad Kahil and injured 52 others.\n\n**Civilians and Infrastructure**\n\nThe war saw significant damage to Gaza, with reports of widespread destruction of infrastructure, including homes, schools, and hospitals. The conflict also saw the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people, with many forced to seek shelter in UNRWA-run schools and other makeshift facilities.\n\n**Diplomatic Impact**\n\nThe war sparked a major diplomatic crisis, with many countries around the world reacting strongly to the conflict that affected the momentum of regional relations. At least nine countries took the drastic step of recalling their ambassadors and cutting diplomatic ties with Israel.\n\n**Humanitarian Crisis**\n\nThe Gaza Strip is experiencing a humanitarian crisis as a result of the Israel–Hamas war. The crisis includes both a famine and a healthcare collapse. At the start of the war, Israel tightened its blockade on the Gaza Strip, which has resulted in significant shortages of fuel, food, medication, water, and essential medical supplies.\n\n**Scale of Destruction**\n\nThe scale, extent, and pace of destruction of buildings in the Gaza Strip ranks among the most severe in modern history, surpassing the bombing of Dresden, Hamburg, and London combined during World War II.\n\n**War Crimes**\n\nA UN Commission to the Israel–Palestine conflict stated that there is \"clear evidence that war crimes may have been committed in the latest explosion of violence in Israel and Gaza, and all those who have violated international law and targeted civilians must be held accountable.\"\n\n**Media Coverage**\n\nIn reporting on the conflict, foreign media such as CNN, ABC, NBC, The New York Times, and Fox News have limited access to Gaza and only in the presence of Israeli soldiers. The conflict has also seen large numbers of journalists wounded or killed in action.\n\n**Us", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Israel–Hamas_war\" following this

targets [220] According to Haaretz's journalist Josh Breiner, a police source said that a police investigation indicated an IDF helicopter which had fired on Hamas militants \"apparently also hit some festival participants\" in the Re'im music festival massacre [219] The Israeli police denied the Haaretz report [232]\n\n\nIsraeli blockade and bombardment\nFollowing the surprise attack, the Israeli Air Force conducted airstrikes that they said targeted Hamas compounds, command centers, tunnels, and other targets [204] [241] [248] Israel employed its artificial intelligence Habsora (\"The Gospel\") software with a new and superior capacity to automatically generate targets to be attacked [249] [250] Two days after the surprise attack, Israel said that 426 Hamas targets had been hit,

the 1973 Yom Kippur War [253] [254]\n\n\nEvacuation of Northern Gaza\nAlmost a week after the initial attack on Israel, on 13 October, the IDF called the evacuation of all civilians of Gaza City to the area south of the Wadi Gaza [263] All Palestinians in that region, including those in Gaza City, were given 24 hours to evacuate to the south The Hamas Authority for Refugee Affairs responded by telling residents in northern Gaza to \"remain steadfast in your homes and stand firm in the face of this disgusting psychological war waged by the occupation\" [264] The statement by Israel faced widespread backlash; with numerous agencies, such as Doctors Without Borders, the World Health Organization, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, among others, condemning the order as \"outrageous\" and \"impossible\" while calling for an immediate reversal of the order [265]\n\n\n17 October\nOn 17 October, Israel bombed in areas of southern Gaza [275] Ministry of Health officials in Gaza reported heavy overnight bombing killing over 70 people, including families who had evacuated from Gaza City in the north [276] One of the airstrikes killed a senior Hamas military commander Ayman Nofal [277] In the afternoon, an Israeli strike hit a UNRWA school in the Al-Maghazi refugee camp, killing six and injuring 12 [278] Late in the evening, an explosion occurred in the parking lot of the Al-Ahli Arabi Baptist Hospital in the center of Gaza City, killing hundreds The cause of the explosion was disputed by Hamas and the IDF, and the ongoing conflict prevented independent on-site analysis [279] Palestinian statements that it was an Israeli airstrike were denied by the IDF, which stated that the explosion resulted from a failed rocket launch by Palestinian Islamic Jihad [280] The PIJ denied any involvement [281] [282]\n\n\nInvasion of the Gaza Strip until the truce (October–November 2023)\nOn 27 October, the IDF launched a

in or near the hospital [296] Associated Press reported that Israeli airstrikes also destroyed roads leading to the Al-Shifa hospital, making it increasingly difficult to reach [297] The following day, the IDF struck at densely-populated Jabalia refugee camp, killing 50 and wounding 150 Palestinians according to the Gaza Health Ministry According to Israel, a senior Hamas commander and dozens of militants in a vast underground tunnel complex were among those killed Hamas denied the presence of a senior commander on the scene [298] [299] [300] The nearby Indonesia Hospital's surgical director said they had received 120 dead bodies and treated 280 wounded, the majority of them women and children [301] The attack resulted in several ambassador recalls [302] [303] [304] According to The New York Times at least two 2,000-pound bombs, the second largest type in Israel's arsenal, were used [305]\n\n\nDuration of the truce (November–December 2023)\nFollowing the introduction of a Qatari-brokered truce on 24 November, starting at 7:00 am Israel time, active fighting in the Gaza Strip ceased and some of the Israeli and foreign hostages were released by Hamas in exchange for the release of some of the Palestinian political prisoners held by Israel The truce was announced for a period of four days but was extended for a longer period.\n\n\nResumption of hostilities (December 2023 – May 2024)\nThe truce expired on 1 December, as Israel and Hamas blamed each other for failing to agree on an extension The disagreement centered on \"how to define soldiers versus civilians and how many Palestinian prisoners Israel would release for its hostages\" [323] The remaining Israeli hostages include a year old baby, his 4-year-old brother and their mother, 13 women aged 18–39, and 85 men, some over 80 [324] Thousands of Palestinians remain in administrative detention [325] A Hamas official said that after the exchange, the only remaining hostages were \"soldiers and civilian men who served in the occupation army\", and refused to exchange them until \"all our prisoners are freed and a ceasefire takes hold\" [326] US National Security Advisor Kirby said \"Hamas agreed to allow the Red Cross access to these hostages while the pause was in place\", which \"didn't happen and is still not happening\" [327] The Palestinian Prisoners' Club said 240 Palestinian prisoners were released as part of the ceasefire deal, another 240 Palestinians were incarcerated Released Palestinian prisoners reported mistreatment including beatings, overcrowding, food deprivation, and

January 2024)\nThe truce expired on 1 December, as Israel and Hamas blamed each other for failing to agree on an extension The disagreement centered on \"how to define soldiers versus civilians and

or kneeling on the ground, with some bound and blindfolded\" were seen on social media [345]The Guardian reported that among those in the images were civilians, including a journalist The ICRC said it was concerned and strongly emphasized \"the importance of treating all those detained with humanity and dignity, in accordance with international humanitarian law\" [346] The BBC reported that a video of the apparent surrender of weapons was unclear on whether a man is \"surrendering\" weapons, or just moving them as instructed, suggesting it was performed for the camera, rather than authentic surrender, and it is unknown if the individuals are involved with Hamas, or the 7 October attack [347] Haaretz reported that Israel believed about 10% of the people shown in the video were affiliated with Hamas, and despite public statements by Israel, this was not a \"mass surrender\" by Hamas [348] Amnesty International described the treatment of those detained on 7 December as a violation of international law [349]\n\n\nWithdrawal from Northern Gaza (January–February 2024)\nOn 1 January 2024, Israel withdrew from neighborhoods in North Gaza [356] On 7 January, the IDF conducted a targeted

accepted the terms of a ceasefire brokered by Egypt and Qatar [416] The deal included a 6-week ceasefire and exchange of prisoners [417] However, Israel rejected this deal [418] Israel responded that the terms Hamas had accepted were \"far from Israel's basic requirements\", but that it would send a delegation to further negotiate \"to exhaust the possibility of reaching an agreement under conditions acceptable to Israel\", while the military operation on Rafah would continue in the meantime to \"exert military pressure on Hamas\" [419] [420]\n\n\nContinued operations throughout Gaza

[558]\n\n\nKilling of Yahya Sinwar\nOn 16 October, IDF ground forces killed Yahya Sinwar in a shootout in Tal as-Sultan [559] The conscript soldiers who participated in the shootout were not initially aware that one of the militants they had killed was Sinwar, and he was identified the following day by his dental records [560] Sinwar's death while participating in ground battles alongside a small group of militants ran counter to the Israeli defense establishment's assumptions that he would be hiding underground, surrounded by hostages There were no hostages in Sinwar's vicinity at the time of his death, [561] and no civilian casualties were reported [562] Joe Biden urged Israel to end the war citing victory as a result of Sinwar's death [563]\n\n\nGenerals' plan\nOn 13 October, senior IDF officials told Haaretz that the government was not seeking to revive hostage talks and that political leadership was pushing for the annexation of parts of the Gaza Strip [564] In the later weeks of October, Israel's siege on North Gaza intensified and daily aid shipments dropped significantly Eyewitnesses reported the shelling of hospitals, razing of shelters, and abductions of men and boys by the Israeli military, leading to speculation that Israel had decided to implement a plan by a group of retired generals to turn the northern Strip into a closed military zone and declare all who refuse to leave as combatants [565]  On 18 October, an Israeli air strike on several houses in the vicinity of the Nassar Junction in Jabalia refugee camp killed 33 people, injured 85 others and trapped several others under the rubble [566] [567] [568] On 19 October, Israel bombed al-Awda Hospital in Jabalia and Kamal Adwan and the Indonesian hospitals in Beit Lahiya [569] The IDF continued

residential area inside the Jabalia refugee camp According to an assessment by Gaza Civil Defense, 150 people were either killed or injured [576] On 25 October, Gaza Civil Defense said that an Israeli drone strike on a group of Palestinians receiving aid near Shati refugee camp killed 12 people [577] The WHO said it had lost contact with Kamal Adwan hospital that night, and UN human rights chief Volker Türk called recent developments in North Gaza the \"darkest moment\" in the war so far In his statement, Türk invoked the international obligation to prevent genocide, marking a departure from UN hesitancy to use that word regarding the war [578] On 26 October, an Israeli strike on a residential area in Beit Lahia killed at least 35 Palestinians [579] On 27 October, Israeli forces bombed a building that housed displaced people in Beit Lahia, killing ten people [580] An Israeli airstrike on the UN-run Asmaa school sheltering displaced families in Al-Shati refugee camp killed at least 11 people and injured several others [581] [582] [583]\n\n\nOther confrontations\nHezbollah in southern Lebanon and the Houthi movement in Yemen have launched limited attacks against Israel, raising fears of a wider regional military conflict Iranian-backed militias in Iraq and Syria have also traded attacks with the US and IDF [584] Israel has bombed targets in and around Damascus throughout the war, [585] [586] [587] with an attack on the Iranian embassy in Damascus on 1 April leading to a direct Iranian response [588] Iran launched a series of retaliatory airstrikes on Israel [588] [589] Over 100 Palestinians have been killed in confrontations with Israeli soldiers and settlers in the West Bank since 7 October Settler violence has been heavily criticized by the IDF [590] [591]\n\n\nWest Bank and Israel\nAmnesty International released a report [592] on 5 February 2024 stating that Israel is carrying out unlawful killings in the West Bank and displaying \"a chilling disregard for Palestinian lives\" and that Israeli forces are carrying out numerous illegal acts of violence that constitute clear violations of international law [593] [594]\n\n\nIsraeli settlements\nIsraeli settlers have taken advantage of the ongoing war to expand settlement activity supported by a far-right Israeli government, [631] [597] [632] including land seizure and large scale settlement plans [633] In 2024, Israeli land seizures exceeded the combined total of the previous 20 years [634]\n\n\nAttacks in Israel\nDuring the war, civilians in Israel have been subjected to intermittent killings and other violent actions For example, on 30 November, two Palestinian gunmen killed three and wounded eleven Israeli civilians at a bus stop on the Givat Shaul Interchange in Jerusalem Hamas claimed responsibility [635] On 16 February 2024, a Palestinian gunman shot and killed two Israeli civilians and injured four others in Kiryat Malakhi, Israel The shooter was killed by an off-duty IDF reservist at the scene [636] On 12 April 2024 a 14-old Israeli shepherd was killed and on 16 April 2024 two Palestinians were killed by Israeli settlers in Aqraba [637] On 13 May, at the Tarqumiya checkpoint, a convoy of trucks carrying food supplies to Gaza was attacked by Israeli settlers, who damaged the trucks and threw supplies on the ground [638]\n\n\nIsraeli prisons and detention camps\nIsrael has dramatically increased its use of administrative detention against Palestinians from both the West Bank and Gaza, as well as Palestinian citizens of Israel, since the start of the war Administrative detention was already at a 20-year high before October 2023 [639] At least 60 Palestinians have died in Israeli detention since 7 October [640]\n\n\nLebanon\nA series of border clashes with Hezbollah along the Israel–Lebanon border began shortly after the 7 October attack In 2024, Israel escalated its assault on Lebanon, carrying out explosive device attacks, assassinations of Hezbollah and Hamas leaders, and expanding its bombing campaign On 1 October, Israel began a ground invasion of Lebanon More than 2,500 people have been killed and 20% of Lebanon's population has been displaced [649]\n\n\nClashes\nOn 8 October, Hezbollah launched an artillery attack on Israeli positions in Shebaa Farms; this was met with immediate retaliation [650] [651]

as well as over 294 Lebanese civilians, more than 25 Syrian civilians and over 27 Israeli civilians, [653] [654] one Lebanese Army soldier, [655] and the displacement of more than 500,000 people in Lebanon and over 96,000 more in Israel [656] [657] On 13 October, Reuters journalist Issam Abdullah was killed by Israeli tank fire while reporting on the border skirmishes [658] The inability of Israelis to return to settlements and homes in the north of the country led to Antony Blinken stating that Israel had effectively \"lost sovereignty in the northern quadrant of its country\" [659] On 27 July 2024, the Majdal Shams attack occurred, killing 12 children in the Golan Heights area [660] [661] The attack, which was carried out by Hezbollah according to Israel and the US, marked an escalation in hostilities and opened discussion about a broader war with Lebanon Hezbollah denied responsibility for the attack [662]\n\n\nEscalation\nWhile the Biden administration publicly urged Israel to reach a negotiated solution with Hezbollah, senior white house officials including Amos Hochstein and Brett McGurk privately assured Israel that the US backed its decision to escalate militarily [663] On 17 September 2024, at least 12 people were killed and thousands of others including Hezbollah members and civilians were wounded across Lebanon and Syria following multiple explosions blamed on pagers used by Hezbollah to prevent their members being targeted by mobile phone signals Among those reported injured was the Iranian ambassador to Lebanon, Mojtaba Amani [664]

injure any of the crew [769]\n\n\nIranian strikes on Israel\nOn 13 April, following an Israeli airstrike on its consulate building in Damascus, Syria on 1 April, [775] Iran launched Operation True Promise, [776] a series of retaliatory airstrikes on Israel, [588] [589] attacking the country from Iranian soil for the first time [777]\n\n\nIsraeli response\nOn 12 October, the United States authorized the deployment of THAAD missile defense systems and American crews to man them to Israel in anticipation of an Iranian response to the planned Israeli retaliation for Iran's 1 October strikes [781] [782] Massive cyberattacks were reported on nuclear facilities and government agencies of Iran [783] Leaked US intelligence documents revealed that Israel was conducting covert drone operations over Iran in preparation for a strike The documents also showed that the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency was monitoring Israeli weapons movements, ground forces, air defenses, navy, air and special forces, and nuclear weapons, but that it lacked the intelligence to anticipate an Israeli strike US intelligence did not find any indication that Israel was planning to use nuclear weapons in its response [784] [785] On 23 October, Gholamreza Jalali, the head of Iran's National Organization for Passive Defense said that Israeli cyberattacks against Iranian interests are continuing, but they are facing a \"layer-by-layer\" defence strategy that have kept them at bay [786] On 24 October, IRGC chief Hossein Salami claimed that THAAD systems will not be enough if Israel prompts an Iranian attack by attacking Iran [787] On 26 October, the IDF carried out airstrikes in Iran in response to its attacks against Israel [788] [789] An Iranian civilian and four Iranian

the Israel–Hamas war, including 131-143 journalists and media workers (123-130 Palestinian, 2-4 Israeli, 6-8 Lebanese and 1 Syrian) according to Committee to Protect Journalists and International Federation of Journalists [799] [800], 120 academics [801] and over 224 humanitarian aid workers, including 179 employees of UNRWA [802]\n\n\nHumanitarian crisis\nThe Gaza Strip is experiencing a humanitarian crisis as a result of the Israel–Hamas war [819] [820] The crisis includes both a famine and a healthcare collapse At the start of the war, Israel tightened its blockade on the Gaza Strip, which has resulted in significant shortages of fuel, food, medication, water, and essential medical supplies [819] [821] [822] This siege resulted in a 90% drop in electricity availability, impacting hospital power supplies, sewage plants, and shutting down the desalination plants that provide drinking water [823] Widespread disease outbreaks have spread across Gaza [820]\n\n\nScale of destruction\nThe scale, extent, and pace of destruction of buildings in the Gaza Strip ranks among the most severe in modern history, [842] [843] [844] surpassing the bombing of Dresden, Hamburg, and London combined during World War II [845] [846] [847] The 29,000 munitions – shells and bombs – that Israel had dropped on Gaza in three months greatly exceed the amount (3,678) dropped by the United States between 2004 and 2010 after its invasion of Iraq [848] After a year, the UN estimates that a total of 42m tonnes of rubble clutter the Strip, to clear and rebuilt which might take 80 years, and cost over $80bn [849] An earlier estimate worked out that 300 kilograms of rubble on average existed per square metre of Gaza [850] The estimated extent of the destruction ranges from 35% of all buildings (March 2024, UNITAR) [851] [852] to 70% (December 2023, The Wall Street Journal), [847] with a higher level of destruction in northern Gaza [853] [854] The damage to buildings in northern Gaza reportedly exceeds that in Bakhmut and Mariupol in the Russian invasion of Ukraine, [846] Aleppo in the Battle of Aleppo, [842] and Mosul and Raqqa in the War against the Islamic State; [842] by 5 December 2023, the percentage of buildings damaged or destroyed in Gaza exceeded Dresden and Cologne during World War II and approached the level of destruction seen in Hamburg [846] [855] Bombing has destroyed or damaged apartment buildings, hospitals, schools, religious sites, factories, and shopping centers [847] The Guardian reported that the scale of destruction has led international legal experts to raise the concept of domicide, which it describes as \"the mass destruction of dwellings to make  [a] territory uninhabitable\" [843]\n\n\nWar crimes\nA UN Commission to the Israel–Palestine conflict stated that there is \"clear evidence that war crimes may have been committed in the latest explosion of violence in Israel and Gaza, and all those who have violated international law and targeted civilians must be held accountable.\" [856] [857] [858] On 27 October, a spokesperson for the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) called for an independent court to review potential war crimes committed by both sides [859]\n\n\nDiplomatic impact\nThe war sparked a major diplomatic crisis, with many countries around the world reacting strongly to the conflict that affected the momentum of regional relations [878] At least nine countries took the drastic step of recalling their ambassadors and cutting diplomatic ties with Israel [879] [880] The war has also resulted in a renewed focus on a two-state solution to the broader conflict [881] [882] Global public opinion of Israel has dropped during the war as well; a Morning Consult poll published in January 2024 indicated that the United States was the only remaining wealthy country in which Israel had net positive approval [883]\n\n\nReactions\nThe Israeli government's response to the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel has multiple aspects, including a military response leading to the Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip In October, the Knesset approved a war cabinet in Israel, adding National Unity ministers and altering the government; Benjamin Netanyahu and Benny Gantz froze non-war legislation, establishing a war cabinet with military authority.\n\n\nIsrael\nThe Israeli government's response to the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel has multiple aspects, including a military response leading to the Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip In October, the Knesset approved a war cabinet in Israel, adding National Unity ministers and altering the government; Benjamin Netanyahu and Benny Gantz froze non-war legislation, establishing a war cabinet with military authority.\n\n\nPalestinian territories\nInitially, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas asserted the Palestinian people's right to self-defense against the \"terror of settlers and occupation troops\" [899] and condemned the orders by Israel for residents to evacuate north Gaza, labeling it a \"second Nakba\" [900] Later, Abbas rejected the killing of civilians on both sides, and said that the Palestinian Liberation Organization was the sole representative of the Palestinian people [901]\n\n\nInternational\nSignificant geopolitical divisions emerged during the war Much of the Western world provided strong diplomatic and military support to Israel, [902] including the United States, [903] United Kingdom, [904] and Germany [905] although the strong support is \"at odds with the attitudes of Western publics which continue to shift away from Israel\", according to Hugh Lovatt, a senior policy fellow with the Middle East and North Africa Programme at the European Council on Foreign Relations Lovatt says that during the Cold War, Israel sided with the West against the Arab countries supported by the Soviets, and Western leaders generally see Israel \"as a fellow member of the liberal democratic club\" and that this partially \"explains the continued strong Western support for Israel – which has now largely become reflexive\" [902] At least 44 nations denounced Hamas and explicitly condemned its conduct on 7 October as terrorism, including a joint statement by the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and Germany [906]\n\n\nEvacuations of foreign nationals\nBrazil announced a rescue operation of nationals using an air force transport aircraft [912] Poland announced that it would deploy two C-130 transport planes to evacuate 200 of its nationals [913] Hungary evacuated 215 of its nationals from Israel using two aircraft on 9 October, while Romania evacuated 245 of its citizens, including two pilgrimage groups, on two TAROM planes and two private aircraft on the same day [914] Australia also announced repatriation flights [915] 300 Nigerian pilgrims in Israel fled to Jordan before being airlifted home [916]\n\n\nImpacts\nAccording to Daniel Byman and Alexander Palmer, the attack showcased the decline of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the rise of Hamas as a power center in Palestinian politics They predicted the PLO's further decline if the status quo held [921] Laith Alajlouni wrote that the immediate effect of the Hamas offensive was to unite Hamas and PLO However, it may soon lead to conflict between them, possibly leading the PLO to lose control of the security situation in the West Bank, if more militant groups there begin to launch their independent attacks [922]\n\n\nRegional impact\nAccording to Daniel Byman and Alexander Palmer, the attack showcased the decline of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the rise of Hamas as a power center in Palestinian politics They predicted the PLO's further decline if the status quo held [921] Laith Alajlouni wrote that the immediate effect of the Hamas offensive was to unite Hamas and PLO However, it may soon lead to conflict between them, possibly leading the PLO to lose control of the security situation in the West Bank, if more militant groups there begin to launch their independent attacks [922]\n\n\nEconomic impact\nThe Bank of Israel estimates that by 2025, the war will have cost the country US$67 billion, notwithstanding a $14.5 billion US aid package, part of the $22.76 billion the U.S has so far allocated for military assistance [936] [937]\n\n\nMedia coverage\nIn reporting on the conflict, foreign media such as CNN, ABC, NBC, The New York Times, and Fox News have limited access to Gaza and only in the presence of Israeli soldiers Vox reported that the news organizations \"have to submit all materials and footage to the IDF for review before publication\" [947] The conflict has also seen large numbers of journalists wounded or killed in action On 14 December, CBS reported on a statement from the International Federation of Journalists that \"the number of journalists killed in the past two months in the war in Gaza has surpassed the amount killed in the Vietnam War, which lasted two decades\" [948] Reporters Without Borders filed a complaint with the International Criminal Court under section 8.2.b of the Rome Statute, accusing Israel of committing war crimes against 8 journalists [949] [947] It also lodged a complaint against Hamas, under section 8.2.a of the Rome Statute for the killing of a reporter covering the 7 October attack [949] The Committee to Protect Journalists has accused Israel of targeting journalists reporting from Gaza and their families, saying that in at least two cases, \"journalists reported receiving threats from Israeli officials and Israel Defense Forces officers before their family members were killed\" [950]\n\n\nUse of propaganda\nIn the hours after the attack on 7 October, Hamas \"employed a broad, sophisticated media strategy\" using bot accounts to spread graphic, emotionally charged and false propaganda that was picked up and repeated by official accounts and foreign governments Cyabra, an Israeli social media intelligence company found that on the day after the attack, one in four posts about the conflict on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and X were from fake accounts The New York Times described the start of the Israel–Hamas war as releasing a \"deluge of online propaganda and disinformation\" that was \"larger than anything seen before\" It described the conflict as \"fast becoming a world war online\" and stated that Russia, China, Iran and its proxies had used state media and covert influence campaigns on social media networks to support Hamas, undermine Israel, criticize the United States and cause unrest James Rubin of the U.S State Department's Global Engagement Center called coverage of the conflict as being swept up in \"an undeclared information war with authoritarian countries\" [951]\n\n\nBy Hamas\nIn the hours after the attack on 7 October,

information war with authoritarian countries\" [951]\n\n\nBy Israel\nDuring the conflict, the Israeli government and Israeli cyber companies have deployed AI tools and bot farms to spread disinformation and spread graphic, emotionally charged and false propaganda to dehumanize Palestinians, sow division among supporters of Palestine by targeting Black lawmakers, and exert pressure on politicians to support Israel's actions [952] [953] [954] The Intercept reported that: \"At the center of Israel's information warfare campaign is a tactical mission to dehumanize Palestinians and to flood the public discourse with a stream of false, unsubstantiated, and unverifiable allegations.\" [954] One such covert campaign was commissioned by Israel's Ministry of Diaspora Affairs The ministry allocated about $2 million to the operation, and used political marketing firm Stoic based in Tel Aviv to carry it out, according to officials and documents reviewed by the New York Times The campaign was started after the 7 October attack, and remained active on X (formerly Twitter) at the time of the New York Times report in June 2024 At the peak of the campaign it used hundreds of fake accounts posing as Americans on X, Facebook and Instagram to post pro-Israel comments, focusing on U.S lawmakers, particularly those who are Black and from the Democratic Party, including Hakeem

life on Earth For 17 years, the remnants of humanity shelter in a state-of-the-art self-sustaining circumnavigational train, the Snowpiercer, run by reclusive transportation magnate Wilford The passengers on the train are segregated, with the elite in the extravagant front cars and the poor crammed into squalid tail compartments overseen by armed guards.\n\n\nCast\nAdditionally, Adnan Hasković as Franco the Younger, an executor of the army led by Mason; [66] [67] Clark Middleton as the Painter, who is often seen drawing other passengers or key events visually chronicling underclass

grabbed my attention was the unique cinematic space of a train Hundreds of metal pieces moving like a snake carrying people squirming inside gripped my heart And the people were fighting against each other They were not equal in this Noah's ark that held the last survivors as they were divided into cars.\n\n\nFilming\nIn August 2011, the studio was determined as the shooting location, and in October 2011, Bong and his production team moved to the Czech Republic [109] [110] [111] During the period of November 2011 to April 2012, the key members of the crew were secured and confirmed, those being: Ondřej Nekvasil, Eric Durst, Julian Spencer and Marco Beltrami The preparatory production began in Tyrol, Austria during mid-March for one day to shoot some snowy scenery on the Hintertux Glacier, which made for excellent conditions and perfect weather [112] [113] On 3 April 2012, principal photography had officially begun in Prague, Czech Republic, at the Barrandov Studios on gimbals on its interconnected sound-stages after preparatory filming in the production occurred at the end of March, with a said budget near to $42 million, which was the largest film budget of all time for any film with Korean investors [114]\n\n\nVisual effects\nThe visual effects company Scanline VFX worked on Snowpiercer [124] The company worked primarily on the exterior shots of the film: the frozen city, the Yekaterina Bridge, the Frozen Harbour landscape in the sushi lounge, the \"Frozen Seven\" sequence, the industrial park in the shoot-out sequence, and the avalanche and post crash environment at the end of the film [125] Already having multiple designs, storyboards and basic concepts of the train cars, it set in motion the development of over 60 different versions of the various wagons for the train Snowpiercer Thus, visual effects supervisor Michel Mielke said \".. we  [had] a good idea of the vision of director Bong, we saw what he liked, and what did not work for the movie.\" [125]\n\n\nDesign\nCostume designer Catherine George explained that Mason was initially inspired by a Smithsonian photograph that production designer Ondřej Nekvasil had found of an older lady amongst a room full of dead birds at the Museum of Natural History, who was a real person from Swinton's childhood [126] In designing Mason's costume, George found images of women from their late sixties and early seventies, adding that, \".. a certain type that I remembered growing up who would wear their fur to go into town and scoff at people who were less better off, a bit of a Margaret Thatcher type, really.\" [127] George also designed Minister Mason's suit to look \"a typical conservative politician shape and style\" with the purple adding a royal quality to the attire [127] She had \"collected pictures of dictators wearing elaborate uniforms and crazy hand-made medals\" to experiment with the designs of such a character [128] George later admitted to the similarities to Ayn Rand, although not intentional [128] George and Bong travelled to Swinton's home in Scotland with \"a couple of suitcases of clothes, wigs, glasses and teeth\" and played with costuming ideas for Swinton's Minster Mason character [126]\n\n\nCostume design\nCostume designer Catherine George explained that Mason was initially inspired by a Smithsonian photograph that production designer Ondřej

played with costuming ideas for Swinton's Minster Mason character [126]\n\n\nProduction design\nBong and his illustrators created various pieces of concept art for the train cars of Snowpiercer, led by Czech production designer Ondřej Nekvasil, who was brought onto the production team to help realize those visions [87] [130] Nekvasil approached the atmosphere of the tail section it as if it were a \"dark, monochromatic .. life\", emphasising poor living arrangements, to which he found inspiration from poor areas of Hong Kong and elsewhere to put in the set designs In order to make the colours appear \"used\" and \"dirty\", Nekvasil and company started with colourful props that were subsequently washed out and forcibly aged to create a feeling of \"really used property and space\", while creating a back story to justify the appearance [130]\n\n\nSound design\nSound engineers Anna Behlmer, Terry Porter and Mark Holding mixed the sound for Snowpiercer, supervised by sound editor Taeyoung Choi [135]\n\n\nMusic and soundtrack\nIn May 2012, Marco Beltrami was hired to compose the incidental music for Snowpiercer [136] In January 2013, a song titled Yona Lights was released on the film's official website in South Korea [137] In July 2013, during the 007 Fimucité at Tenerife International Film Music Festival in the Canary Islands, a few pieces of the three films composed by Beltrami (Snowpiercer, Soul Surfer and The Wolverine) were selected for the performance [138]\n\n\nRelease\nSnowpiercer premiered at the Times Square on 29 July 2013 in Seoul, South Korea, [140] before screening at the Deauville American Film Festival as the closing film on 7 September 2013, [141] the Berlin International Film Festival as the part of Berlin's Forum sidebar on 7 February 2014, [142] opening the Los Angeles Film Festival on 11 June 2014, [143] and the Edinburgh International Film Festival on 22 June 2014 [144]\n\n\nCutting request\nOn 9 November 2012, The Weinstein Company acquired the distribution rights to Snowpiercer from CJ Entertainment based on the script and some completed footage, with a plan for wide release in North America, as well as throughout the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa [145] It was released in the United States on 27 June 2014 in just eight theaters in selected cities [146] This delay was caused by Harvey Weinstein,

\"Le Transperceneige\" by Jacques Lob, Benjamin Legrand, and Jean-Marc Rochette. The film is set in a post-apocalyptic world where a catastrophic event has caused the Earth to become a frozen wasteland, and the last remaining humans live on a massive train called Snowpiercer.\n\n**Plot**\n\nIn 2014, an attempt to stop climate change via stratospheric aerosol injection catastrophically backfires, creating a new ice age that destroys much of life on Earth. For 17 years, the remnants of humanity shelter in a state-of-the-art self-sustaining circumnavigational train, the Snowpiercer, run by reclusive transportation magnate Wilford. The passengers on the train are segregated, with the elite in the extravagant front cars and the poor crammed into squalid tail compartments overseen by armed guards.\n\n**Cast**\n\nThe film features a diverse cast of characters, including:\n\n* Chris Evans as Curtis Everett, the leader of the rebellion against Wilford\n* Song Kang-ho as Wilford, the enigmatic and ruthless leader of the train\n* Ed Harris as Namgoong Minsu, a hardened and experienced member of the train's security team\n* John Hurt as Gilliam, a senior member of the train's crew\n* Tilda Swinton as Minister Mason, a high-ranking official on the train\n* Octavia Spencer as Yona, a young and determined member of the rebellion\n* Ah-sung Ko as Timmy, a young boy who becomes embroiled in the rebellion\n* Ko Ah-sung as Yona, a young girl who becomes a key player in the rebellion\n* Clarke Lewis Johnson as Gregor, a member of the train's engineering team\n* Ewen Bremner as Edgar, a rebellious member of the train's security team\n* Jamie Bell as Fred, a young and idealistic member of the rebellion\n* Ko Asung as Yona, a young girl who becomes a key player in the rebellion\n* Adnan Hasković as Franco the Younger, an executor of the army led by Mason\n* Clark Middleton as the Painter, who is often seen drawing other passengers or key events visually chronicling underclass life and death\n* Emma Levie as Claude, Wilford's assistant who may have a relationship with Wilford\n* Tómas Lemarquis as Egg-head, one of Wilford's agents that aids in the New Year celebration massacre\n* Steve Park as Fuyu, a regimented assistant to Mason\n* Paul Lazar as Paul, one of the rebels in Curtis's army who makes the protein blocks\n\n**Production**\n\nWhen Bong first came across the graphic novel, he was immediately drawn to the unique cinematic space of the train. He saw the potential for a thought-provoking and visually stunning film that would explore themes of class, privilege, and rebellion. Bong and his team traveled to various locations, including the Czech Republic and Austria, to shoot the film. The production team worked tirelessly to bring the world of Snowpiercer to life, using a combination of practical and visual effects to create the stunning visuals.\n\n**Visual Effects**\n\nThe visual effects team, led by Michel Mielke, worked on creating the exterior shots of the film, including the frozen city, the Yekaterina Bridge, and the Frozen Harbour landscape in the sushi lounge. They also created the \"Frozen Seven\" sequence, the industrial park in the shoot-out sequence, and the avalanche and post-crash environment at the end of the film.\n\n**Design**\n\nThe production design team, led by Ondřej Nekvasil, worked on creating the interior and exterior design of the train. They drew inspiration from various sources, including the real-life Trans-Siberian Railway and the iconic train stations of the 19th and 20th centuries. The design team aimed to create a sense of opulence and luxury in the front cars, while also conveying a sense of squalor and desperation in the tail compartments.\n\n**Sound Design**\n\nThe sound design team, led by Anna Behlmer, Terry Porter, and Mark Holding, worked on creating the soundtrack for the film. They used a combination of practical and synthesized sounds to create the unique sonic landscape of the train. The sound design team also worked closely with Bong to ensure that the sound effects and music were in line with his vision for the film.\n\n**Music and Soundtrack**\n\nThe music for Snowpiercer was composed by Marco Beltrami, who worked closely with Bong to create a unique and haunting soundtrack. The score features a combination of orchestral and electronic elements, which perfectly capture the mood and atmosphere of the film. The soundtrack also features a number of iconic themes, including the \"Snowpiercer\" theme, which has become synonymous with the film.\n\n**Release**\n\nSnowpiercer premiered at the Times Square in Seoul, South Korea on July 29, 2013, and later screened at the Deauville American Film Festival as the closing film on September 7, 2013. The film was released in the United States on June 27, 2014, and later in the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa.\n\n**Cutting Request**\n\nIn November 2012, The Weinstein Company acquired the distribution rights to Snowpiercer from CJ Entertainment based on the script and some completed footage. However, Harvey Weinstein requested 25 minutes of footage be cut, asking for less dialogue and more action. Bong lied to Weinstein, claiming his father was a fisherman and the scene was in tribute to his father, to get Weinstein to agree to keep the fish-gutting scene. The film's original cut was later released, but with the caveat that the film switched distributors to Radius-TWC, resulting in a limited release in art house cinemas.\n\n**Home Media**\n\nSnowpiercer was released on DVD and Blu-ray in various countries, including France and Korea.

period of November 2011 to April 2012, the key members of the crew were secured and confirmed, those being: Ondřej Nekvasil, Eric Durst, Julian Spencer and Marco Beltrami The preparatory production began in Tyrol, Austria during mid-March for one day to shoot some snowy scenery on the Hintertux Glacier, which made for excellent conditions and perfect weather [112] [113] On 3 April 2012, principal photography had officially begun in Prague, Czech Republic, at the Barrandov Studios on gimbals on its interconnected sound-stages after preparatory filming in the production occurred at the end of March, with a said budget near to $42 million, which was the largest film budget of all time for any film with Korean investors [114]\n\n\nVisual effects\nThe visual effects company Scanline VFX worked on Snowpiercer [124] The company worked primarily on the exterior shots of the film: the frozen city, the Yekaterina Bridge, the Frozen Harbour landscape in the sushi lounge, the \"Frozen Seven\" sequence, the industrial park in the shoot-out sequence, and the avalanche and post crash environment at the end of the film [125] Already having multiple designs, storyboards and basic concepts of the train cars, it set in motion the development of over 60 different versions of the various wagons for the train Snowpiercer Thus, visual effects supervisor Michel Mielke said \".. we  [had] a good idea of the vision of director Bong, we saw what he liked, and what did not work for the movie.\" [125]\n\n\nDesign\nCostume designer Catherine George explained that Mason was initially inspired by a Smithsonian photograph that production designer Ondřej Nekvasil had found of an older lady amongst a room full of dead birds at the Museum of Natural History, who was a real person from Swinton's childhood [126] In designing Mason's costume, George found images of women from their late sixties and early seventies, adding that, \".. a certain type that I remembered growing up who would wear their fur to go into town and scoff at people who were less better off, a bit of a Margaret Thatcher type, really.\" [127] George also designed Minister Mason's suit to look \"a typical conservative politician shape and style\" with the purple adding a royal quality to the attire [127] She had \"collected pictures of dictators wearing elaborate uniforms and crazy hand-made medals\" to experiment with the designs of such a character [128] George later admitted to the similarities to Ayn Rand, although not intentional [128] George and Bong travelled to Swinton's home in Scotland with \"a couple of suitcases of clothes, wigs, glasses and teeth\" and played with costuming ideas for Swinton's Minster Mason character [126]\n\n\nCostume design\nCostume designer Catherine George

design\nBong and his illustrators created various pieces of concept art for the train cars of Snowpiercer, led by Czech production designer Ondřej Nekvasil, who was brought onto the production team to help realize those visions [87] [130] Nekvasil approached the atmosphere of the tail section it as if it were a \"dark, monochromatic .. life\", emphasising poor living arrangements, to which he found inspiration from poor areas of Hong Kong and elsewhere to put in the set designs In order to make the colours appear \"used\" and \"dirty\", Nekvasil and company started with colourful props that were subsequently washed out and forcibly aged to create a feeling of \"really used property and space\", while creating a back story to justify the appearance [130]\n\n\nSound design\nSound engineers Anna Behlmer, Terry Porter and Mark Holding mixed the sound for Snowpiercer, supervised by sound editor Taeyoung Choi [135]\n\n\nMusic and soundtrack\nIn May 2012, Marco Beltrami was hired to compose the incidental music for Snowpiercer [136] In January 2013, a song titled Yona Lights was released on the film's official website in South Korea [137] In July 2013, during the 007 Fimucité at Tenerife

on one occasion, he and the principal cellist played alternate notes of the printed score, and on another they sabotaged some of their colleagues' music stands to make them collapse in mid-performance [1] Nevertheless, the earnings from his orchestral work enabled him to take lessons with the celebrated cellist Louis-Pierre Norblin [26] He made a favourable impression on the composer and conductor Fromental Halévy, who gave him lessons in composition and orchestration and wrote to Isaac Offenbach in Cologne that the young man was going to be a great composer [27] Some of Offenbach's early compositions were played by the fashionable conductor Louis-Antoine Jullien [28] Offenbach and another young composer, Friedrich von Flotow, collaborated in 1839 on a series of works for cello and piano [4] [29] Although Offenbach's ambition was to compose for the stage, he could not gain an entrée to Parisian theatre at this point in his career; with Flotow's help, he built a reputation composing for and playing in the fashionable salons of Paris [30] Through contacts he made there he gained pupils [4] In 1838 the Théâtre du Palais-Royal commissioned him to compose songs for the play Pascal et Chambord, staged in March 1839 [31] In January 1839, together with his elder brother, he gave his first public concert [32]\n\n\nBouffes-Parisiens, Champs-Élysées\nBetween 1853 and May 1855 Offenbach wrote three one-act operettas and managed to have them staged in Paris [n 8] They were all well received, but the authorities of the Opéra-Comique remained unmoved Offenbach found more encouragement from the composer, singer and impresario Florimond Ronger, known professionally as Hervé At his theatre, the Folies-Nouvelles, opened in 1854, Hervé pioneered French light comic opera, or \"opérette\" [15] [58] In The Musical Quarterly, Martial Teneo and Theodore Baker wrote, \"Without the example set by Hervé, Offenbach might perhaps never have become the musician who penned Orphée aux Enfers, La belle Hélène, and so many other triumphant works.\" [59] Offenbach approached Hervé, who agreed to present a new one-act operetta with words by Jules Moinaux and music by Offenbach, called Oyayaye ou La reine des îles [n 9] It was presented on 26 June 1855 and was well received Offenbach's biographer Peter Gammond describes it as \"a charming piece of nonsense\" [63] The piece depicts a double-bass player, played by Hervé, shipwrecked on a cannibal island, who after several perilous encounters with the female chief of the cannibals makes his escape using his double-bass as a boat [60] Offenbach pressed ahead with plans to present his works himself at his own theatre [63] and to abandon further thoughts of acceptance by the Opéra-Comique [34]\n\n\nSalle Choiseul\nOffenbach's first piece for the company's new home was Ba-ta-clan (December 1855), a well-received piece of mock-oriental frivolity, to a libretto by Halévy [76] He followed it with fifteen more one-act operettas over the next three years [4] They were all for the small casts permitted under his licence, although at the Salle Choiseul he was granted an increase from three to four singers [71]\n\n\nOrphée aux enfers\nIn 1858, the government lifted the licensing restrictions on the number of performers, and Offenbach was able to present more ambitious works His first full-length operetta, Orphée aux enfers (\"Orpheus in the Underworld\"), was presented in October 1858 Offenbach, as usual, spent freely on the production, with scenery by Gustave Doré, lavish costumes, a cast of twenty principals, and a large chorus and orchestra [93]\n\n\nEarly 1860s\nThe 1860s were Offenbach's most successful decade At the beginning of 1860, he was granted French citizenship by the personal command of Napoleon III, [101] and the following year he was appointed a chevalier of the Légion d'honneur; this appointment scandalised those members of the musical establishment who resented such an honour for a composer of popular light opera [102] Offenbach began the decade with his only substantial ballet score, Le papillon (\"The Butterfly\"), produced at the Opéra in 1860 It achieved what was then a successful run of 42 performances, without, as the biographer Andrew Lamb says, \"giving him any greater acceptance in more respectable circles\" [4] Among other operettas in the same year, he finally had a piece presented by the Opéra-Comique, the three-act Barkouf It was not a success; its plot revolved around a dog, and Offenbach attempted canine imitations in his music Neither the public nor the critics were impressed, and the piece survived for only seven performances [103]\n\n\nLater 1860s\nBetween 1864 and 1868 Offenbach wrote four of the operettas for which he is chiefly remembered: La belle Hélène (1864), La Vie parisienne (1866), La Grande-Duchesse de Gérolstein (1867) and La Périchole (1868) Halévy was joined as librettist for all of them by Henri Meilhac Offenbach, who called them \"Meil\" and \"Hal\", [110] said of this trinity: \"Je suis sans doute le Père, mais chacun des deux est mon Fils et plein d'Esprit,\" [111] a play on words loosely translated as \"I am certainly the Father, but each of them is my Son and Wholly Spirited\" [n 17]\n\n\nWar and aftermath\nOffenbach returned hurriedly from a trip to Ems and Wiesbaden just before the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870 He then went to his home in Étretat in Normandy and arranged for his family to move to the safety of San Sebastián in northern Spain, joining them shortly afterwards [125] [126] Having risen to fame under Napoleon III, satirised him, and been rewarded by him, Offenbach was universally associated with the old régime: he was known as \"the mocking-bird of the Second Empire\" [127] When the empire fell in the wake of Prussia's crushing victory at Sedan in September 1870, Offenbach's music was suddenly out of favour France was swept by violently anti-German sentiments, and despite his French citizenship and Légion d'honneur, his birth and upbringing in Cologne made him suspect His operettas were now frequently vilified as the embodiment of everything superficial and worthless in Napoleon III's régime [43] La Grande-Duchesse de Gérolstein was banned in France because of its antimilitarist satire [128]\n\n\nLast years\nProfitable though La fille du tambour-major was, composing it left Offenbach less time to work on his cherished project, the creation of a successful serious opera Since the beginning of 1877, he had been working when he could on a piece based on a stage play, Les contes fantastiques d'Hoffmann, by Jules Barbier and Michel Carré Offenbach had suffered from gout since the 1860s, often being carried into the theatre in a chair Now in failing health, he was conscious of his own mortality and wished passionately to live long enough to complete the opera, Les contes d'Hoffmann (\"The Tales of Hoffmann\") He was heard saying to Kleinzach, his dog, \"I would give everything I have to be at the première\" [140] Offenbach did not live to finish the piece He left the vocal score substantially complete and had made a start on the orchestration Ernest Guiraud, a family friend, assisted by Offenbach's 18-year-old son Auguste, completed the orchestration, making major changes as well as the substantial cuts demanded by the Opéra-Comique's director, Carvalho [141] [n 18] The opera was first seen at the Opéra-Comique on 10 February 1881 [141] Offenbach also left his last comedy, Belle Lurette, unfinished; Léo Delibes orchestrated it and it was given at the Théâtre de la Renaissance on 30 October 1880 [143]\n\n\nWorks\nIn The Musical Times, Mark Lubbock wrote in 1957: [146]\n\n\nOperettas\nBy his own reckoning, Offenbach composed more than 100 operas [148] [n 20] Both the number and the noun are open to question: some works were so extensively revised that he evidently counted the revised versions as new, and commentators generally refer to all but a few of his stage works as operettas, rather than operas Offenbach reserved the term opérette (English: operetta) [n 21] or opérette bouffe for some of his one-act works, more often using the term opéra bouffe for his full-length ones (though there are several one- and two-act examples of this type) It was only with the further development of the Operette genre in Vienna after 1870 that the French term opérette began to be used for works longer than one act [151] Offenbach also used the term opéra-comique for at least 24 of his works in either one, two or three acts [152] [n 22]\n\n\nTexts and word setting\nThe first ideas for plots usually came from Offenbach, his librettists working along lines agreed with him Lamb writes, \"In this respect Offenbach was both well served and skilful at discovering talent Like Sullivan, and unlike Johann Strauss II, he was consistently blessed with workable subjects and genuinely witty librettos.\" [4] In his setting of his librettists' words he took advantage of the rhythmic flexibility of the French language, and sometimes took this to extremes, forcing words into unnatural stresses [155] Harding comments that he \"wrought much violence on the French language\" [156] A frequent characteristic of Offenbach's word setting was the nonsensical repetition of isolated syllables of words for comic effect; an example is the quintet for the kings in La belle Hélène: \"Je suis l'époux de la reine/Poux de la reine/Poux de la reine\" and \"Le roi barbu qui s'avance/Bu qui s'avance/Bu qui s'avance.\" [n 23]\n\n\nMusical structure\nIn general, Offenbach followed simple, established forms His melodies are usually short and unvaried in their basic rhythm, rarely, in Hughes's words, escaping \"the despotism of the four-bar phrase\" [157] In modulation Offenbach was similarly cautious; he rarely switched a melody to a remote or unexpected key, and kept mostly to a tonic–dominant–subdominant pattern [158] Within these conventional limits, he employed greater resource in his varied use of rhythm; in a single number he would contrast rapid patter for one singer with a broad, smooth phrase for another, illustrating their different characters [158] He often switched quickly between major and minor keys, effectively contrasting characters or situations [159] When he wished to, Offenbach could use unconventional techniques, such as the leitmotif, used throughout to accompany the eponymous Docteur Ox (1877) [160] and to parody Wagner in La carnaval des revues (1860) [161]\n\n\nOrchestration\nIn his early pieces for the Bouffes-Parisiens, the size of the orchestra pit had restricted Offenbach to an orchestra of sixteen players [162] He composed for flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon, two horns, piston, trombone, percussion (including timpani) and a small string section of seven players [163] After moving to the Salle Choiseul he had an orchestra of 30 players [163] The musicologist and Offenbach specialist Jean-Christophe Keck notes that when larger orchestras were available, either in bigger Paris theatres or in Vienna or elsewhere, Offenbach would compose, or rearrange existing music, accordingly Surviving scores show his instrumentation for additional wind and brass, and even extra percussion When they were available he wrote for cor anglais, harp, and – exceptionally, Keck records – an ophicleide (Le Papillon), tubular bells (Le carnaval des revues), and a wind machine (Le voyage dans la lune) [163]\n\n\nCompositional method\nAccording to Keck, Offenbach would first make a note of melodies a libretto suggested to him in a notebook or straight onto the librettist's manuscript Next using full score manuscript paper he wrote down vocal parts in the centre, then a piano accompaniment at the bottom possibly with notes on orchestration When Offenbach felt sure the work would be performed, he began full orchestration, often employing a sort of shorthand [165]\n\n\nParody and influences\nOffenbach was well known for parodying other composers' music Some of them saw the joke and others did not Adam, Auber and Meyerbeer enjoyed Offenbach's parodies of their scores [59] Meyerbeer made a point of attending all Bouffes-Parisiens productions, always seated in Offenbach's private box [71] Among the composers who were not amused by Offenbach's parodies were Berlioz and Wagner [166] Offenbach mocked Berlioz's \"strivings after the antique\", [167] and his initial light-hearted satire of Wagner's pretensions later hardened into genuine dislike [168] Berlioz reacted by bracketing Offenbach and Wagner together as \"the product of the mad German mind\", and Wagner, ignoring Berlioz, retaliated by writing some unflattering verses about Offenbach [166]\n\n\nOther works\nOf Offenbach's two serious operas, Die Rheinnixen, a failure, was not revived until the 21st century [171] His second attempt, The Tales of Hoffmann, was originally intended as a grand opera [172] When the work was accepted by Léon Carvalho for production at the Opéra-Comique, Offenbach agreed to make it an opéra comique with spoken dialogue It was incomplete when he died; [173] Faris speculates that, but for Georges Bizet's premature death, Bizet rather than Guiraud would have been asked to complete the piece and would have done so more satisfactorily [174] The critic Tim Ashley writes, \"Stylistically, the opera reveals a remarkable amalgam of French and German influences .. Weberian chorales preface Hoffmann's narrative Olympia delivers a big coloratura aria straight out of French grand opera, while Antonia sings herself to death to music reminiscent of Schubert.\" [43]\n\n\nArrangements and editions\nAlthough the overtures to Orphée aux enfers and La belle Hélène are well known and frequently recorded, the scores usually performed and recorded are not by Offenbach, but were arranged from music in the operas by Carl Binder and Eduard Haensch, respectively, for the Vienna premieres of the two works [180] Offenbach's own preludes are much shorter [181]\n\n\nLegacy and reputation\nOffenbach had a considerable influence on some later French composers, although his immediate successor, Lecocq, strove to distance himself and went out of his way to avoid rhythmic devices familiar from Offenbach's works [187] Francis Poulenc in his biography of Emmanuel Chabrier wrote that as a great admirer of Offenbach, Chabrier took to imitating him explicitly in some details: \"Hence 'Donnez-vous la peine de vous asseoir' (chanson du pal) is directly derived from 'Roi barbu qui s'avance, bu qui s'avance' in La belle Hélène\" [188] Poulenc traces the influence through Chabrier and André Messager to his own music [188] The composer and musicologist Wilfrid Mellers finds music modelled on Offenbach's in Poulenc's Les mamelles de Tirésias [189]\n\n\nInfluence\nOffenbach had a considerable influence on some later French composers, although his immediate successor, Lecocq, strove to distance himself and went out of his way to avoid rhythmic devices familiar from Offenbach's works [187] Francis Poulenc in his biography of Emmanuel Chabrier wrote that as a great admirer of Offenbach, Chabrier took to imitating him explicitly in some details: \"Hence 'Donnez-vous la peine de vous asseoir' (chanson du pal) is directly derived from 'Roi barbu qui s'avance, bu qui s'avance' in La belle Hélène\" [188] Poulenc traces the influence through Chabrier and André Messager to his own music [188] The composer and musicologist Wilfrid Mellers finds music modelled on Offenbach's in Poulenc's Les mamelles de Tirésias [189]\n\n\nReputation\nDuring Offenbach's lifetime, and in the obituary notices in 1880, fastidious critics (dubbed \"Musical Snobs Ltd\" by Gammond) showed themselves at odds with public appreciation [215] In a 1980 article in The Musical Times, George Hauger commented that those critics not only underrated Offenbach, but wrongly supposed that his music would soon be forgotten [216] Although most critics of the time made that erroneous assumption, a few perceived Offenbach's unusual quality; in The Times, Francis Hueffer wrote, \"none of his numerous Parisian imitators has ever been able to rival Offenbach at his best\" [217] Nevertheless, the paper joined in the general prediction: \"It is very doubtful whether any of his works will survive.\" [217] The New York Times shared this view: \"That he had the gift of melody in a very extraordinary degree is not to be denied, but he wrote currente calamo, [n 28] and the lack of development of his choicest inspirations will, it is to be feared, keep them from reaching even the next generation\" [218] After the posthumous production of The Tales of Hoffmann, The Times partially reconsidered its judgment, writing, \"Les Contes de Hoffmann  [will] confirm the opinion of those who regard him as a great composer in every sense of the word\" It then lapsed into what Gammond calls \"Victorian sanctimoniousness\" [219] by taking it for granted that the opera \"will uphold Offenbach's fame long after his lighter compositions have passed out of memory\" [220]\n\n\nNotes and references\nAux maris ré,\nAux maris cal,\nAux maris ci,\nAux maris trants,\nAux maris récalcitrants.\n\n\nNotes\nAux maris ré,\nAux maris cal,\nAux maris ci,\nAux maris trants,\nAux maris récalcitrants.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\nSheet music\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Jacques Offenbach**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nJacques Offenbach was a German-born French composer, cellist, and impresario. He is best known for his operettas, which became a hallmark of 19th-century French musical theatre. His music is a blend of wit, humor, and satire, often with a nod to the excesses of the Second Empire. Offenbach's legacy extends beyond his own compositions, as his influence can be seen in the works of later French composers, such as Francis Poulenc and André Messager.\n\n**Life and Career**\n\nOffenbach was born on 20 June 1819, in Cologne, Germany, to a Jewish family. His father, Isaac Juda Offenbach, was a cantor and a violinist who had adopted the name \"Offenbach\" after his native town, Offenbach am Main. Isaac had a musical family, and Offenbach's early exposure to music was extensive. He began his musical education at a young age, studying cello, violin, and singing.\n\nOffenbach's early career was marked by a series of moves, from Cologne to Paris, and eventually to Vienna. He worked as a cellist in various orchestras, including the Opéra-Comique, where he gained experience and developed his skills. In 1835, he became a permanent member of the Opéra-Comique's orchestra, where he remained for several years.\n\n**Cello Virtuoso**\n\nOffenbach's time at the conservatoire, under the tutelage of the stern academician Cherubini, was marked by a sense of rebellion. He was free to starve, but also free to explore his own musical interests. He secured temporary work in theatre orchestras, eventually gaining a permanent appointment as a cellist at the Opéra-Comique. Offenbach's cello playing was known for its virtuosity, but also for its pranks and antics during performances. He and his colleagues would often sabotage their music stands, causing chaos during performances.\n\n**Bouffes-Parisiens, Champs-Élysées**\n\nOffenbach's first piece for the Bouffes-Parisiens, a small theatre in Paris, was a one-act operetta called Ba-ta-clan. The piece was well-received, and Offenbach went on to write 15 more one-act operettas for the Bouffes-Parisiens over the next three years. These works were all for small casts, but Offenbach was granted an increase from three to four singers at the Salle Choiseul.\n\n**Orphée aux Enfants**\n\nOffenbach's first full-length operetta, Orphée aux Enfants, was presented in October 1858. The piece was a huge success, with scenery by Gustave Doré and a cast of 20 principals. Offenbach's music was lavish, with a large chorus and orchestra.\n\n**Early 1860s**\n\nThe 1860s were Offenbach's most successful decade. He began the decade with his only substantial ballet score, Le Papillon. The piece was a success, running for 42 performances without gaining him acceptance in more respectable circles. Among other operettas, he finally had a piece presented by the Opéra-Comique, Barkouf. The piece was not a success, with a plot revolved around a dog and Offenbach's attempts at canine imitations in his music.\n\n**Later 1860s**\n\nBetween 1864 and 1868, Offenbach wrote four of the operettas for which he is chiefly remembered: La Belle Hélène, La Vie Parisienne, La Grande-Duchesse de Gérolstein, and La Périchole. These operettas were all collaborations with Henri Meilhac and Jacques Halévy. Offenbach called them \"Meil\" and \"Hal,\" and said of this trinity: \"Je suis sans doute le Père, mais chacun des deux est mon Fils et plein d'Esprit.\"\n\n**War and Aftermath**\n\nOffenbach returned hurriedly from a trip to Ems and Wiesbaden just before the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870. He then went to his home in Étretat in Normandy and arranged for his family to move to the safety of San Sebastián in northern Spain, joining them shortly afterwards. Offenbach's music was suddenly out of favor, and his operettas were vilified as the embodiment of everything superficial and worthless in Napoleon III's régime.\n\n**Last Years**\n\nOffenbach's last years were marked by a series of compositions, including La Fille du Tambour-Major and Les Contes Fantastiques d'Hoffmann. The latter was left incomplete at the time of Offenbach's death, but was completed by Ernest Guiraud and premiered at the Opéra-Comique in 1881.\n\n**Works**\n\nOffenbach composed over 100 operas and operettas throughout his career. His works include operettas, ballets, and incidental music. He was known for his wit, humor, and satire, often with a nod to the excesses of the Second Empire.\n\n**Musical Structure**\n\nOffenbach's music is characterized by simple, established forms. His melodies are usually short and unvaried in their basic rhythm, rarely escaping the despotism of the four-bar phrase. In modulation, Offenbach was similarly cautious, rarely switching a melody to a remote or unexpected key.\n\n**Orchestration**\n\nOffenbach's orchestration is characterized by a range of instruments, from the small orchestra of the Bouffes-Parisiens to the large orchestra of the Opéra-Comique. He was known for his use of unusual instruments, such as the ophicleide and the wind machine.\n\n**Parody and Influences**\n\nOffenbach was well known for his parody of other composers' music. Some of them saw the joke and others did not. Adam, Auber, and Meyerbeer enjoyed Offenbach's parodies of their scores, while Berlioz and Wagner did not.\n\n**Legacy and Reputation**\n\nOffenbach's legacy extends beyond his own compositions, as his influence can be seen in the works of later French composers, such as Francis Poulenc and André Messager. During Offenbach's lifetime, and in the obituary notices in 1880, fastidious critics showed themselves at odds with public appreciation.

with Flotow's help, he built a reputation composing for and playing in the fashionable salons of Paris [30] Through contacts he made there he gained pupils [4] In 1838 the Théâtre du Palais-Royal commissioned him to compose songs for the play Pascal et Chambord, staged in March 1839 [31] In January 1839, together with his elder brother, he gave his first public concert [32]\n\n\nBouffes-Parisiens, Champs-Élysées\nBetween 1853 and May 1855 Offenbach wrote three one-act operettas and managed to have them staged in Paris [n 8] They were all well received, but the authorities of the Opéra-Comique remained unmoved Offenbach found more encouragement from the composer, singer and impresario Florimond Ronger, known professionally as Hervé At his theatre, the Folies-Nouvelles, opened in 1854, Hervé pioneered French light comic opera, or \"opérette\" [15] [58] In The Musical Quarterly, Martial Teneo and Theodore Baker wrote, \"Without the example set by Hervé, Offenbach might perhaps never have become the musician who penned Orphée aux Enfers, La belle Hélène, and so many other triumphant works.\" [59] Offenbach approached Hervé, who agreed to present a new one-act operetta with words by Jules Moinaux and music by Offenbach, called Oyayaye ou La reine des îles [n 9] It was presented on 26 June 1855 and was well received Offenbach's biographer Peter Gammond describes it as \"a charming piece of nonsense\" [63] The piece depicts a double-bass player, played by Hervé, shipwrecked on a cannibal island, who after several perilous encounters with the female chief of the cannibals makes his escape using his double-bass as a boat [60] Offenbach pressed ahead with plans to present his works himself at his own theatre [63] and to abandon further thoughts of acceptance by the Opéra-Comique [34]\n\n\nSalle Choiseul\nOffenbach's first piece for the company's new home was Ba-ta-clan (December 1855), a well-received piece of mock-oriental frivolity, to a libretto by Halévy [76] He followed it with fifteen more one-act operettas over the next three years [4] They were all for the small casts permitted under his licence, although at the Salle Choiseul he was granted an increase from three to four singers [71]\n\n\nOrphée aux enfers\nIn 1858, the government lifted the licensing restrictions on the number of performers, and Offenbach was able to present more ambitious works His first full-length operetta, Orphée aux enfers (\"Orpheus in the Underworld\"), was presented in October 1858 Offenbach, as usual, spent freely on the production, with scenery by Gustave Doré, lavish costumes, a cast of twenty principals, and a large chorus and orchestra [93]\n\n\nEarly 1860s\nThe 1860s were Offenbach's most successful decade At the beginning of 1860, he was granted French citizenship by the personal command of Napoleon III, [101] and the following year he was appointed a chevalier of the Légion d'honneur; this appointment scandalised those members of the musical establishment who resented such an honour for a composer of popular light opera [102] Offenbach began the decade with his only substantial ballet score, Le papillon (\"The Butterfly\"), produced at the Opéra in 1860 It achieved what was then a successful run of 42 performances, without, as the biographer Andrew Lamb says, \"giving him any greater acceptance in more respectable circles\" [4] Among other operettas in the same year, he finally had a piece presented by the Opéra-Comique, the three-act Barkouf It was not a success; its plot revolved around a dog, and Offenbach attempted canine imitations in his music Neither the public nor the critics were impressed, and the piece survived for only seven performances [103]\n\n\nLater 1860s\nBetween 1864 and 1868 Offenbach wrote four of the operettas for which he is chiefly remembered: La belle Hélène (1864), La Vie parisienne (1866), La Grande-Duchesse de Gérolstein (1867) and La Périchole (1868) Halévy was joined as librettist for all of them by Henri Meilhac Offenbach, who called them \"Meil\" and \"Hal\", [110] said of this trinity: \"Je suis sans doute le Père, mais chacun des deux est mon Fils et plein d'Esprit,\" [111] a play on words loosely translated as \"I am certainly the Father, but each of them is my Son and Wholly Spirited\" [n 17]\n\n\nWar and aftermath\nOffenbach returned hurriedly from a trip to Ems and Wiesbaden just before the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870 He then went to his home in Étretat in Normandy and arranged for his family to move to the safety of San Sebastián in northern Spain, joining them shortly afterwards [125] [126] Having risen to fame under Napoleon III, satirised him, and been rewarded by him, Offenbach was universally associated with the old régime: he was known as \"the mocking-bird of the Second Empire\" [127] When the empire fell in the wake of Prussia's crushing victory at Sedan in September 1870, Offenbach's music was suddenly out of favour France was swept by violently anti-German sentiments, and despite his French citizenship and Légion d'honneur, his birth and upbringing in Cologne made him suspect His operettas were now frequently vilified as the embodiment of everything superficial and worthless in Napoleon III's régime [43] La Grande-Duchesse de Gérolstein was banned in France because of its antimilitarist satire [128]\n\n\nLast years\nProfitable though La fille du tambour-major was, composing it left Offenbach less time to work on his cherished project, the creation of a successful serious opera Since the beginning of 1877, he had been working when he could on a piece based on a stage play, Les contes fantastiques d'Hoffmann, by Jules Barbier and Michel Carré Offenbach had suffered from gout since the 1860s, often being carried into the theatre in a chair Now in failing health, he was conscious of his own mortality and wished passionately to live long enough to complete the opera, Les contes d'Hoffmann (\"The Tales of Hoffmann\") He was heard saying to Kleinzach, his dog, \"I would give everything I have to be at the première\" [140] Offenbach did not live to finish the piece He left the vocal score substantially complete and had made a start on the orchestration Ernest Guiraud, a family friend, assisted by Offenbach's 18-year-old son Auguste, completed the orchestration, making major changes as well as the substantial cuts demanded by the Opéra-Comique's director, Carvalho [141] [n 18] The opera was first seen at the Opéra-Comique on 10 February 1881 [141] Offenbach also left his last comedy, Belle Lurette, unfinished; Léo Delibes orchestrated it and it was given at the Théâtre de la Renaissance on 30 October 1880 [143]\n\n\nWorks\nIn The Musical Times, Mark Lubbock wrote in 1957: [146]\n\n\nOperettas\nBy his own reckoning, Offenbach composed more than 100 operas [148] [n 20] Both the number and the noun are open to question: some works were so extensively revised that he evidently counted the revised versions as new, and commentators generally refer to all but a few of his stage works as operettas, rather than operas Offenbach reserved the term opérette (English: operetta) [n 21] or opérette bouffe for some of his one-act works, more often using the term opéra bouffe for his full-length ones (though there are several one- and two-act examples of this type) It was only with the further development of the Operette genre in Vienna after 1870 that the French term opérette began to be used for works longer than one act [151] Offenbach also used the term opéra-comique for at least 24 of his works in either one, two or three acts [152] [n 22]\n\n\nTexts and word setting\nThe first ideas for plots usually came from Offenbach, his librettists working along lines agreed with him Lamb writes, \"In this respect Offenbach was both well served and skilful at discovering talent Like Sullivan, and unlike Johann Strauss II, he was consistently blessed with workable subjects and genuinely witty librettos.\" [4] In his setting of his librettists' words he took advantage of the rhythmic flexibility of the French language, and sometimes took this to extremes, forcing words into unnatural stresses [155] Harding comments that he \"wrought much violence on the French language\" [156] A frequent characteristic of Offenbach's word setting was the nonsensical repetition of isolated syllables of words for comic effect; an example is the quintet for the kings in La belle Hélène: \"Je suis l'époux de la reine/Poux de la reine/Poux de la reine\" and \"Le roi barbu qui s'avance/Bu qui s'avance/Bu qui s'avance.\" [n 23]\n\n\nMusical structure\nIn general, Offenbach followed simple, established forms His melodies are usually short and unvaried in their basic rhythm, rarely, in Hughes's words, escaping \"the despotism of the four-bar phrase\" [157] In modulation Offenbach was similarly cautious; he rarely switched a melody to a remote or unexpected key, and kept mostly to a tonic–dominant–subdominant pattern [158] Within these conventional limits, he employed greater resource in his varied use of rhythm; in a single number he would contrast rapid patter for one singer with a broad, smooth phrase for another, illustrating their different characters [158] He often switched quickly between major and minor keys, effectively contrasting characters or situations [159] When he wished to, Offenbach could use unconventional techniques, such as the leitmotif, used throughout to accompany the eponymous Docteur Ox (1877) [160] and to parody Wagner in La carnaval des revues (1860) [161]\n\n\nOrchestration\nIn his early pieces for the Bouffes-Parisiens, the size of the orchestra pit had restricted Offenbach to an orchestra of sixteen players [162] He composed for flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon, two horns, piston, trombone, percussion (including timpani) and a small string section of seven players [163] After moving to the Salle Choiseul he had an orchestra of 30 players [163] The musicologist and Offenbach specialist Jean-Christophe Keck notes that when larger orchestras were available, either in bigger Paris theatres or in Vienna or elsewhere, Offenbach would compose, or rearrange existing music, accordingly Surviving scores show his instrumentation for additional wind and brass, and even extra percussion When they were available he wrote for cor anglais, harp, and – exceptionally, Keck records – an ophicleide (Le Papillon), tubular bells (Le carnaval des revues), and a wind machine (Le voyage dans la lune) [163]\n\n\nCompositional method\nAccording to Keck, Offenbach would first make a note of melodies a libretto suggested to him in a notebook or straight onto the librettist's manuscript Next using full score manuscript paper he wrote down vocal parts in the centre, then a piano accompaniment at the bottom possibly with notes on orchestration When Offenbach felt sure the work would be performed, he began full orchestration, often employing a sort of shorthand [165]\n\n\nParody and influences\nOffenbach was well known for parodying other composers' music Some of them saw the joke and others did not Adam, Auber and Meyerbeer enjoyed Offenbach's parodies of their scores [59] Meyerbeer made a point of attending all Bouffes-Parisiens productions, always seated in Offenbach's private box [71] Among the composers who were not amused by Offenbach's parodies were Berlioz and Wagner [166] Offenbach mocked Berlioz's \"strivings after the antique\", [167] and his initial light-hearted satire of Wagner's pretensions later hardened into genuine dislike [168] Berlioz reacted by bracketing Offenbach and Wagner together as \"the product of the mad German mind\", and Wagner, ignoring Berlioz, retaliated by writing some unflattering verses about Offenbach [166]\n\n\nOther works\nOf Offenbach's two serious operas, Die Rheinnixen, a failure, was not revived until the 21st century [171] His second attempt, The Tales of Hoffmann, was originally intended as a grand opera [172] When the work was accepted by Léon Carvalho for production at the Opéra-Comique, Offenbach agreed to make it an opéra comique with spoken dialogue It was incomplete when he died; [173] Faris speculates that, but for Georges Bizet's premature death, Bizet rather than Guiraud would have been asked to complete the piece and would have done so more satisfactorily [174] The critic Tim Ashley writes, \"Stylistically, the opera reveals a remarkable amalgam of French and German influences .. Weberian chorales preface Hoffmann's narrative Olympia delivers a big coloratura aria straight out of French grand opera, while Antonia sings herself to death to music reminiscent of Schubert.\" [43]\n\n\nArrangements and editions\nAlthough the overtures to Orphée aux enfers and La belle Hélène are well known and frequently recorded, the scores usually performed and recorded are not by Offenbach, but were arranged from music in the operas by Carl Binder and Eduard Haensch, respectively, for the Vienna premieres of the two works [180] Offenbach's own preludes are much shorter [181]\n\n\nLegacy and reputation\nOffenbach had a considerable influence on some later French composers, although his immediate successor, Lecocq, strove to distance himself and went out of his way to avoid rhythmic devices familiar from Offenbach's works [187] Francis Poulenc in his biography of Emmanuel Chabrier wrote that as a great admirer of Offenbach, Chabrier took to imitating him explicitly in some details: \"Hence 'Donnez-vous la peine de vous asseoir' (chanson du pal) is directly derived from 'Roi barbu qui s'avance, bu qui s'avance' in La belle Hélène\" [188] Poulenc traces the influence through Chabrier and André Messager to his own music [188] The composer and musicologist Wilfrid Mellers finds music modelled on Offenbach's in Poulenc's Les mamelles de Tirésias [189]\n\n\nInfluence\nOffenbach had a considerable influence on some later French composers, although his immediate successor, Lecocq, strove to distance himself and went out of his way to avoid rhythmic devices familiar from Offenbach's works [187] Francis Poulenc in his biography of Emmanuel Chabrier wrote that as a great admirer of Offenbach, Chabrier took to imitating him explicitly in some details: \"Hence 'Donnez-vous la peine de vous asseoir' (chanson du pal) is directly derived from 'Roi barbu qui s'avance, bu qui s'avance' in La belle Hélène\" [188] Poulenc traces the influence through Chabrier and André Messager to his own music [188] The composer and musicologist Wilfrid Mellers finds music modelled on Offenbach's in Poulenc's Les mamelles de Tirésias [189]\n\n\nReputation\nDuring Offenbach's lifetime, and in the obituary notices in 1880, fastidious critics (dubbed \"Musical Snobs Ltd\" by Gammond) showed themselves at odds with public appreciation [215] In a 1980 article in The Musical Times, George Hauger commented that those critics not only underrated Offenbach, but wrongly supposed that his music would soon be forgotten [216] Although most critics of the time made that erroneous assumption, a few perceived Offenbach's unusual quality; in The Times, Francis Hueffer wrote, \"none of his numerous Parisian imitators has ever been able to rival Offenbach at his best\" [217] Nevertheless, the paper joined in the general prediction: \"It is very doubtful whether any of his works will survive.\" [217] The New York Times shared this view: \"That he had the gift of melody in a very extraordinary degree is not to be denied, but he wrote currente calamo, [n 28] and the lack of development of his choicest inspirations will, it is to be feared, keep them from reaching even the next generation\" [218] After the posthumous production of The Tales of Hoffmann, The Times partially reconsidered its judgment, writing, \"Les Contes de Hoffmann  [will] confirm the opinion of those who regard him as a great composer in every sense of the word\" It then lapsed into what Gammond calls \"Victorian sanctimoniousness\" [219] by taking it for granted that the opera \"will uphold Offenbach's fame long after his lighter compositions have passed out of memory\" [220]\n\n\nNotes and references\nAux maris ré,\nAux maris cal,\nAux maris ci,\nAux maris trants,\nAux maris récalcitrants.\n\n\nNotes\nAux maris ré,\nAux maris cal,\nAux maris ci,\nAux maris trants,\nAux maris récalcitrants.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\nSheet music\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Hurricane_Ida", "content": "\nMeteorological history\nA weak tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa and moved into the Atlantic Ocean on August 14 The wave moved slowly westward through the monsoon trough without showing any signs of organization over the next several days On August 21, the wave entered a trade wind environment west of 45°W accompanied by a large area of convection, or thunderstorms, that was elongated from east to west As the wave moved over the Windward Islands, the convective coverage increased at which point the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began to the track the system as it continued westward into the Caribbean Sea [4] [15] [16] The next day, the wave interacted with a broad area of low-pressure over the north coast of South America, which led to the formation of a much larger broad low-pressure characterized by spots that were near or below 1006 mbar (29.71 inHg) over the southwestern Caribbean Sea by late the same day On August 25, a vorticity maximum emerged from the eastern side of the larger low-pressure area and convection became concentrated and better organized around it, [4] prompting the NHC to assess this disturbance as a high likelihood of development as it turned north-northwestward [17] The system continued to further organize and obtain a better defined circulation the next day to the south of Jamaica [18] At 12:00 UTC on August 26, the system had attained sufficient organization to be classified as Tropical Depression Nine, about 115 mi (185 km) south-southwest of Negril, Jamaica Upon its development, the depression was moving north-northwestward before turning northwestward a few hours later, steered around the southwestern side of a subtropical ridge located over the western Atlantic Ocean [4] Favorable factors in the system's further development included warm waters of the northwestern Caribbean Sea, low wind shear, and a moist environment [19]\n\n\nPreparations\nOn August 26,

several countries in the Atlantic region, including the Caribbean, the United States, and Canada, in August and September 2021. The storm caused widespread damage, flooding, and loss of life, particularly in the northeastern United States and Canada.\n\n**Meteorological History**\n\nA weak tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa and moved into the Atlantic Ocean on August 14, 2021. The wave moved slowly westward through the monsoon trough without showing any signs of organization over the next several days. On August 21, the wave entered a trade wind environment west of 45°W, accompanied by a large area of convection, or thunderstorms, that was elongated from east to west. As the wave moved over the Windward Islands, the convective coverage increased, and the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began to track the system as it continued westward into the Caribbean Sea.\n\nThe next day, the wave interacted with a broad area of low-pressure over the north coast of South America, which led to the formation of a much larger broad low-pressure area characterized by spots that were near or below 1006 mbar (29.71 inHg) over the southwestern Caribbean Sea by late the same day. On August 25, a vorticity maximum emerged from the eastern side of the larger low-pressure area, and convection became concentrated and better organized around it, prompting the NHC to assess this disturbance as a high likelihood of development. The system continued to further organize and obtain a better-defined circulation the next day to the south of Jamaica.\n\nAt 12:00 UTC on August 26, the system had attained sufficient organization to be classified as Tropical Depression Nine, about 115 mi (185 km) south-southwest of Negril, Jamaica. Upon its development, the depression was moving north-northwestward before turning northwestward a few hours later, steered around the southwestern side of a subtropical ridge located over the western Atlantic Ocean. Favorable factors in the system's further development included warm waters of the northwestern Caribbean Sea, low wind shear, and a moist environment.\n\n**Preparations**\n\nOn August 26, 2021, the Cayman Islands were put under a Tropical Storm Warning, with the expectation of a landfall or near landfall on Grand Cayman. Schools and businesses were closed, and the government had fully activated the NEOC and the Emergency Services, in addition to deploying the Cayman Islands Regiment and Cayman Islands Coast Guard for the HADR and SAR operations. Many people piled into grocery stores and hardware stores to grab supplies, having Hurricane Grace that hit Cayman just a week earlier fresh in everyone's minds. Cayman Airways cancelled some of its flights and rescheduled them for a later day. The utility company had announced that they were planning on little to no power outages.\n\n**Caribbean**\n\nAs a tropical wave, Ida triggered flooding in western Venezuela on August 23, killing 20 people.\n\n**Cayman Islands**\n\nOn August 26, 2021, the Cayman Islands were put under a Tropical Storm Warning, with the expectation of a landfall or near landfall on Grand Cayman.

La Palma also sheltered 6,281 people from the storm.\n\n**United States**\n\nThe storm shut down nearly all Gulf Coast oil production, accounting for about 15% of the U.S total. Louisiana's mainland refineries were also shut down, which account for 12.5% of the nation's capacity. The Colonial Pipeline was partially shut down as a result of the hurricane. This combination of factors caused prices to rise for oil and gasoline products across the United States. Early estimates of insured losses are from $15 billion to $25 billion. The offshore and onshore of the Gulf Region is up to $35 billion in Insured loss.\n\n**Louisiana**\n\nRecovering from the massive blackout in New Orleans was originally estimated to take weeks, but most power was restored within 10 days by repairing a transmission line from Slidell and bringing the New Orleans Power Station online in tandem. The Massachusetts Task Force sent an 80-member team to Baton Rouge to help with the impacts of Ida on August 29. The team was composed of emergency medical technicians, doctors, structure, communication and logistics specialists, and emergency room technicians, among others. People in lower-income communities affected by Ida had trouble affording to leave. States such as Texas and South Carolina and national non-profits also gathered donations to distribute to victims and to help in the search and rescue operations.\n\n**Mississippi**\n\nOver 113,000 people were without electricity on August 30.

Another EF0 tornado struck Pascagoula, causing minor damage to homes and tree limbs.\n\n**Alabama**\n\nSeven weak tornadoes touched down in the southern portion of the state. Three people were injured in Saraland by an EF1 tornado that ripped portions of roofs from motels and an industrial building and knocked down trees, some of which fell on homes. Another EF1 tornado damaged trees, rolled a mobile home, and tore most of the roof of another home southeast of Jackson. The other five tornadoes were rated EF0. Two electrical workers died in Adger while repairing power grid damage caused by the storm.\n\n**Mid-Atlantic**\n\nTwo EF1 tornadoes touched down in Montgomery County, Virginia, on August 31.

{"title": "Vocabularium_Cornicum", "content": "\nHistory\nDuring the migration period, Germanic tribes began to settle in Britain during the 5th century after Roman occupation came to an end [1] The Common Brittonic language, which had been spoken over most of Roman Britain, was pushed west, eventually separating into Western Brittonic (the ancestor of Welsh) and Southwestern Brittonic (the ancestor of Cornish and Breton) under the westward advance of Anglo-Saxon forces [2]\n\n\nDating and provenance\nJackson dates the extant manuscript of the Vocabularium Cornicum to the end of the 12th century, presumed to be a copy, probably made in south-east Wales, [6] of a no longer extant original with a composition date of c. 1100 [7] This date was based on an evaluation by Max Förster, now thought to be incorrect, that the Old English of Ælfric's glossary would not have been understood much beyond this date, and is now generally thought to be too early [8] Most modern assessments estimate a document date of around 1200 or slightly later, from an original that was probably made around 1150 or sometime in the second half of the 12th century, presumably in Cornwall or by a Cornish speaker [6] [8] It is now a part of the Cotton collection in the British Library [9]\n\n\nContent\nThe Vocabularium Cornicum is part of a composite manuscript known as MS Cotton Vespasian A XIV containing texts believed to have been made between the early 11th and late 12th century [9] Other than the Latin-Old Cornish glossary, the manuscript only contains Welsh material, [6] including a Calendar of Welsh saints and an account of the founding of Brycheiniog by the legendary Brychan [8]\n\n\nPhysical format\nOnly a single copy of the document survives, written in ink on sheets of parchment, and consisting of seven sides, written on folios 7r to 10r of the manuscript Each folio is approximately 5 3⁄4 x 8 1⁄4 inches (210 x 145 mm) [6] [9]\n\n\nStructure\nThe glossary itself follows the structure of Ælfric's Glossary, in general agreement with the original entry order, with the Anglo-Saxon glosses substituted by Old Cornish ones [8] As with Ælfric's Glossary, the lemmata are grouped thematically, usually with a Latin lemma followed by a Cornish translation equivalent, beginning with entries for God, heaven, angel, then elements of the Genesis creation narrative including star, sun, moon, the Earth and sea, and human beings The vocabulary continues with a range of subjects including parts of the body, ranks in the church hierarchy, family members, secular positions and class divisions, words for various kinds of professions and artisans and their associated tools, personality traits, illnesses and afflictions, legal terminology, the weather, times of the day, seasons of the year, colours, birds, fish, insects, domestic and wild mammals, herbs, trees, topographical features, architectural terms, household items, clothing, and food and drink, finishing with some adjectives and ending with the Cornish word for 'saddle' [10] [11] The vocabulary contains a total of 961 lemmata, compared with 1,269 in Ælfric's Glossary [10]\n\n\nNumbering\nLemmata in the Vocabularium Cornicum are conventionally labelled by the numerical identifier they are assigned by Eugene Van Tassel Graves in the PhD dissertation The Old Cornish Vocabulary [12] So for instance, \"VC 1\" refers to the first entry in the text, \"Deus omnipotens  duy chefuidoc\" 'almighty God' [10]\n\n\nVocabulary\nCornish is a Celtic language, and almost three-quarters (73%) of the translation equivalents in the Vocabularium Cornicum are thought to be Celtic [13] These include VC 32 nef 'heaven, sky' (from Proto-Celtic *nemos-), [14] VC 35 tir 'land' (from *tīros-), [15] VC 40 pen 'head' (from *kʷenno-), [16] VC 128 lester 'vessel' (from *lestro-), [17] and VC 58 euuin 'nail' (from *anɡʷīnā) [18]\n\n\nOrthography\nLike Old Welsh and Old Breton, Old Cornish orthography was originally based on the pronunciation of British Latin [24] [25] However, by the time of the Vocabularium Cornicum, the orthography, which Jackson describes as \"chronologically more advanced than that of any other  [Old Cornish] document\", [23] shows the increasing influence of Old English scribal practices, such as the use of the graphemes thorn (Þ, þ), eth (Ð, ð), and wynn (Ƿ, ƿ) [26] In final position, ⟨p⟩, ⟨t⟩, ⟨c⟩, ⟨b⟩, ⟨d⟩, and ⟨g⟩ are generally used for the phonemes /b/, /d/, /ɡ/, /β/, /ð/, and /ɣ/ respectively, meaning that the results of Brittonic lenition are not usually apparent from the orthography when these phonemes occur in word-final position [27] However, in internal position, lenition is regularly shown [28]\n\n\nPhonology\nThe orthography used in Vocabularium Cornicum demonstrates the development of several characteristic Cornish sound changes, and the document is important for reconstructing the phonological history of Cornish [29] Assibilation of the clusters /lt/ to /ls/ (e.g mols, Welsh mollt) [30] and /nt/ to /ns/ (e.g abrans, Welsh abrant), [31] and, in one case, bros, assibilation of /d/ to /z/, [32] is shown Denasalization of the lenited reflex of early Common Brittonic /m/ to /v/ is regularly written as ⟨f⟩, ⟨u⟩, and ⟨v⟩ [33] Svarabhakti is regularly written as ⟨e⟩, and is found 40 times in the manuscript according to Jackson, against 3 entries where it is expected but is not written [34] The merger of the /uɪ/ and /ɔɪ/ diphthongs is shown in writing by an indiscriminate mixture of ⟨ui⟩ and ⟨oi⟩ spellings [35] [36]\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Vocabularium Cornicum**\n\nThe Vocabularium Cornicum is a Latin-Old Cornish glossary that is an essential resource for understanding the development of the Cornish language.

The texts are written in Latin and Old Cornish, and they reflect the cultural and linguistic exchange between the two regions.\n\n**Content**\n\nThe Vocabularium Cornicum is a Latin-Old Cornish glossary that contains a wide range of terms related to language, culture, and everyday life. The glossary is organized around a series of themes, including God, heaven, angel, elements of the Genesis creation narrative, and human beings. The vocabulary continues with a range of subjects, including parts of the body, ranks in the church hierarchy, family members, secular positions and class divisions, words for various kinds of professions and artisans and their associated tools, personality traits, illnesses and afflictions, legal terminology, the weather, times of the day, seasons of the year, colors, birds, fish, insects, domestic and wild mammals, herbs, trees, topographical features, architectural terms, household items, clothing, and food and drink.\n\nThe glossary contains a total of 961 lemmata, which are entries in the glossary. The lemmata are conventionally labeled using the numerical identifier they are assigned by Eugene Van Tassel Graves in his PhD dissertation \"The Old Cornish Vocabulary.\"\n\n**Numbering**\n\nThe lemmata in the Vocabularium Cornicum are conventionally labeled by the numerical identifier they are assigned by Eugene Van Tassel Graves in the PhD dissertation \"The Old Cornish Vocabulary.\" For example, \"VC 1\" refers to the first entry in the text, which is \"Deus omnipotens duy chefuidoc\" or \"almighty God.\"\n\n**Vocabulary**\n\nThe Vocabularium Cornicum contains a wide range of Cornish words, including those related to language, culture, and everyday life. Almost three-quarters (73%) of the translation equivalents in the Vocabularium Cornicum are thought to be Celtic. These include words such as \"VC 32 nef\" or \"heaven, sky\" (from Proto-Celtic *nemos-), \"VC 35 tir\" or \"land\" (from *tīros-), \"VC 40 pen\" or \"head\" (from *kʷenno-), \"VC 128 lester\" or \"vessel\" (from *lestro-), and \"VC 58 euuin\" or \"nail\" (from *anɡʷīnā).\n\n**Orthography**\n\nThe orthography used in the Vocabularium Cornicum reflects the development of the Cornish language during the Middle Ages. The document shows the increasing influence of Old English scribal practices, such as the use of the graphemes thorn (Þ, þ), eth (Ð, ð), and wynn (Ƿ, ƿ). In final position, ⟨p⟩, ⟨t⟩, ⟨c⟩, ⟨b⟩, ⟨d⟩, and ⟨g⟩ are generally used for the phonemes /b/, /d/, /ɡ/, /β/, /ð/, and /ɣ/ respectively, meaning that the results of Brittonic lenition are not usually apparent from the orthography when these phonemes occur in word-final position.\n\n**Phonology**\n\nThe orthography used in the Vocabularium Cornicum demonstrates the development of several characteristic Cornish sound changes, and the document is important for reconstructing the phonological history of Cornish. The manuscript shows assibilation of the clusters /lt/ to /ls/ (e.g. mols, Welsh mollt) and /nt/ to /ns/ (e.g. abrans, Welsh abrant). Denasalization of the lenited reflex of early Common Brittonic /m/ to /v/ is regularly written as ⟨f⟩, ⟨u⟩, and ⟨v⟩. Svarabhakti is regularly written as ⟨e⟩, and is found 40 times in the manuscript according to Jackson, against 3 entries where it is expected but is not written. The merger of the /uɪ/ and /ɔɪ/ diphthongs is shown in writing by an indiscriminate mixture of ⟨ui⟩ and ⟨oi⟩ spellings.\n\nThe Vocabularium Cornicum is an essential resource for understanding the development of the Cornish language and the cultural and linguistic exchange between Cornwall and Wales during the Middle Ages. The manuscript is an important artifact of the linguistic and cultural heritage of the region, and it continues to be studied by scholars of language, history, and culture.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Vocabularium_Cornicum\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nDuring the migration period, Germanic tribes began to settle in Britain during the 5th century after Roman occupation came to an end [1] The Common Brittonic language, which had been spoken over most of Roman Britain, was pushed west, eventually separating into Western Brittonic (the ancestor of Welsh) and Southwestern Brittonic (the ancestor of Cornish and Breton) under the westward advance of Anglo-Saxon forces [2]\n\n\nDating and provenance\nJackson dates the extant manuscript of the Vocabularium Cornicum to the end of the 12th century, presumed to be a copy, probably made in south-east Wales, [6] of a no longer extant original with a composition date of c. 1100 [7] This date was based on an evaluation by Max Förster, now thought to be incorrect, that the Old English of Ælfric's glossary would not have been understood much beyond this date, and is now generally thought to be too early [8] Most modern assessments estimate a document date of around 1200 or slightly later, from an original that was probably made around 1150 or sometime in the second half of the 12th century, presumably in Cornwall or by a Cornish speaker [6] [8] It is now a part of the Cotton collection in the British Library [9]\n\n\nContent\nThe Vocabularium Cornicum is part of a composite manuscript known as MS Cotton Vespasian A XIV containing texts believed to have been made between the early 11th and late 12th century [9] Other than the Latin-Old Cornish glossary, the manuscript only contains Welsh material, [6] including a Calendar of Welsh saints and an account of the founding of Brycheiniog by the legendary Brychan [8]\n\n\nPhysical format\nOnly a single copy of the document survives, written in ink on sheets of parchment, and consisting of seven sides, written on folios 7r to 10r of the manuscript Each folio is approximately 5 3⁄4 x 8 1⁄4 inches (210 x 145 mm) [6] [9]\n\n\nStructure\nThe glossary itself follows the structure of Ælfric's Glossary, in general agreement with the original entry order, with the Anglo-Saxon glosses substituted by Old Cornish ones [8] As with Ælfric's Glossary, the lemmata are grouped thematically, usually with a Latin lemma followed by a Cornish translation equivalent, beginning with entries for God, heaven, angel, then elements of the Genesis creation narrative including star, sun, moon, the Earth and sea, and human beings The vocabulary continues with a range of subjects including parts of the body, ranks in the church hierarchy, family members, secular positions and class divisions, words for various kinds of professions and artisans and their associated tools, personality traits, illnesses and afflictions, legal terminology, the weather, times of the day, seasons of the year, colours, birds, fish, insects, domestic and wild mammals, herbs, trees, topographical features, architectural terms, household items, clothing, and food and drink, finishing with some adjectives and ending with the Cornish word for 'saddle' [10] [11] The vocabulary contains a total of 961 lemmata, compared with 1,269 in Ælfric's Glossary [10]\n\n\nNumbering\nLemmata in the Vocabularium Cornicum are conventionally labelled by the numerical identifier they are assigned by Eugene Van Tassel Graves in the PhD dissertation The Old Cornish Vocabulary [12] So for instance, \"VC 1\" refers to the first entry in the text, \"Deus omnipotens  duy chefuidoc\" 'almighty God' [10]\n\n\nVocabulary\nCornish is a Celtic language, and almost three-quarters (73%) of the translation equivalents in the Vocabularium Cornicum are thought to be Celtic [13] These include VC 32 nef 'heaven, sky' (from Proto-Celtic *nemos-), [14] VC 35 tir 'land' (from *tīros-), [15] VC 40 pen 'head' (from *kʷenno-), [16] VC 128 lester 'vessel' (from *lestro-), [17] and VC 58 euuin 'nail' (from *anɡʷīnā) [18]\n\n\nOrthography\nLike Old Welsh and Old Breton, Old Cornish orthography was originally based on the pronunciation of British Latin [24] [25] However, by the time of the Vocabularium Cornicum, the orthography, which Jackson describes as \"chronologically more advanced than that of any other  [Old Cornish] document\", [23] shows the increasing influence of Old English scribal practices, such as the use of the graphemes thorn (Þ, þ), eth (Ð, ð), and wynn (Ƿ, ƿ) [26] In final position, ⟨p⟩, ⟨t⟩, ⟨c⟩, ⟨b⟩, ⟨d⟩, and ⟨g⟩ are generally used for the phonemes /b/, /d/, /ɡ/, /β/, /ð/, and /ɣ/ respectively, meaning that the results of Brittonic lenition are not usually apparent from the orthography when these phonemes occur in word-final position [27] However, in internal position, lenition is regularly shown [28]\n\n\nPhonology\nThe orthography used in Vocabularium Cornicum demonstrates the development of several characteristic Cornish sound changes, and the document is important for reconstructing the phonological history of Cornish [29] Assibilation of the clusters /lt/ to /ls/ (e.g mols, Welsh mollt) [30] and /nt/ to /ns/ (e.g abrans, Welsh abrant), [31] and, in one case, bros, assibilation of /d/ to /z/, [32] is shown Denasalization of the lenited reflex of early Common Brittonic /m/ to /v/ is regularly written as ⟨f⟩, ⟨u⟩, and ⟨v⟩ [33] Svarabhakti is regularly written as ⟨e⟩, and is found 40 times in the manuscript according to Jackson, against 3 entries where it is expected but is not written [34] The merger of the /uɪ/ and /ɔɪ/ diphthongs is shown in writing by an indiscriminate mixture of ⟨ui⟩ and ⟨oi⟩ spellings [35] [36]\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

the Seljuk dynasty [5] The Kingdom of Armenia adopted Christianity as its national religion in the fourth century CE, establishing the Armenian Apostolic Church [6] Following the end of the Byzantine Empire in 1453, two Islamic empires—the Ottoman Empire and the Iranian Safavid Empire—contested Western Armenia, which was permanently separated from Eastern Armenia (held by the Safavids) by the 1639 Treaty of Zuhab [7] The Ottoman Empire was multiethnic and multireligious, [8] and its millet system offered non-Muslims a subordinate but protected place in society [9] Sharia law encoded Islamic superiority but guaranteed property rights and freedom of worship to non-Muslims (dhimmis) in exchange for a special tax [10]\n\n\nArmenians in the Ottoman Empire\nThe presence of Armenians in

and its millet system offered non-Muslims a subordinate but protected place in society [9] Sharia law encoded Islamic superiority but guaranteed property rights and freedom of worship to non-Muslims (dhimmis) in exchange for a special tax [10]\n\n\nLand conflict and reforms\nArmenians in the eastern provinces lived in semi-feudal conditions and commonly encountered forced labor, illegal taxation, and unpunished crimes against them including robberies, murders, and sexual assaults [13] [14] Beginning in 1839, the Ottoman government issued a series of reforms to centralize power and equalize the status of Ottoman subjects regardless of religion The reforms to equalize the status of non-Muslims were strongly opposed by Islamic clergy and Muslims in general, and remained mostly theoretical [15] [16] [17] Because of the abolition of the Kurdish emirates in the mid-nineteenth century, the Ottoman government began to directly tax Armenian peasants who had previously paid taxes only to Kurdish landlords The latter continued to exact levies illegally [18] [19]\n\n\nYoung Turk Revolution\nAbdul Hamid's despotism prompted the formation of an opposition movement, the Young Turks, which sought to overthrow him and restore the 1876 Constitution of the Ottoman Empire, which he had suspended in 1877 [42] One faction of the Young Turks was the secret and revolutionary Committee of Union and Progress (CUP), based in Salonica, from which the charismatic conspirator Mehmed Talaat (later Talaat Pasha [b]) emerged as a leading member [44] Although skeptical of a growing, exclusionary Turkish nationalism in the Young Turk movement, the ARF decided to ally with the CUP in December 1907 [45] [46] In 1908, the CUP came to power in the Young Turk Revolution, which began with a string of CUP assassinations of leading officials in Macedonia [47] [48] Abdul Hamid was forced to reinstate the 1876 constitution and restore the Ottoman parliament, which was celebrated by Ottomans of all ethnicities and religions [49] [50] Security improved in parts of the eastern provinces after 1908 and the CUP took steps to reform the local gendarmerie, [51] although tensions remained high [52] Despite an agreement to reverse the land usurpation of the previous decades in the 1910 Salonica Accord between the ARF and the CUP, the latter made no efforts to carry this out [53] [54]\n\n\nBalkan Wars\nThe 1912 First Balkan War resulted in the loss of almost all of the empire's European territory [65] and the mass expulsion of Muslims from the Balkans [66] Ottoman Muslim society was incensed by the atrocities committed against Balkan Muslims, intensifying anti-Christian sentiment and leading to a desire for revenge [67] [68] Blame for the loss was assigned to all Christians, including the Ottoman Armenians, many of whom had fought on the Ottoman side [69] The Balkan Wars put an end to the Ottomanist movement for pluralism and coexistence; [70] instead, the CUP turned to an increasingly radical Turkish nationalism to preserve the empire [71] CUP leaders such as Talaat and Enver Pasha came to blame non-Muslim population concentrations in strategic areas for many of the empire's problems, concluding by mid-1914 that they were internal tumors to be excised [72] Of these, Ottoman Armenians were considered the most dangerous, because CUP leaders feared that their homeland in Anatolia—claimed as the last refuge of the Turkish nation—would break away from the empire as the Balkans had [73] [74] [71]\n\n\nOttoman entry into World War I\nA few days after the outbreak of World War I, the CUP concluded an alliance with Germany on 2 August 1914 [83] The same month, CUP representatives went to an ARF conference demanding that, in the event of war with Russia, the ARF incite Russian Armenians to intervene on the Ottoman side Instead, the delegates resolved that Armenians should fight for the countries of their citizenships [84] During its war preparations, the Ottoman government recruited thousands of prisoners to join the paramilitary Special Organization, [85] which initially focused on stirring up revolts among Muslims behind Russian lines beginning before the empire officially entered the war [86] On 29 October 1914, the empire entered World War I on the side of the Central Powers by launching a surprise attack on Russian ports in the Black Sea [87] Many Russian Armenians were enthusiastic about the war, but Ottoman Armenians were more ambivalent, afraid that supporting Russia would bring retaliation Organization of Armenian volunteer units by Russian Armenians, later joined by some Ottoman Armenian deserters, further increased Ottoman suspicions against their Armenian population [88]\n\n\nOnset of genocide\nMinister of War Enver Pasha took over command of the Ottoman armies for the invasion of Russian territory, and tried to encircle the Russian Caucasus Army at the Battle of Sarikamish, fought from December 1914 to January 1915 Unprepared for the harsh winter conditions, [100] his forces were routed, losing more than 60,000 men [101] The retreating Ottoman army destroyed dozens of Ottoman Armenian villages in Bitlis vilayet, massacring their inhabitants [97] Enver publicly blamed his defeat on Armenians who he claimed had actively sided with the Russians, a theory that became a consensus among CUP leaders [102] [103] Reports of local incidents such as weapons caches, severed telegraph lines, and occasional killings confirmed preexisting beliefs about Armenian treachery and fueled paranoia among CUP leaders that a coordinated Armenian conspiracy was plotting against the empire [104] [105] Discounting contrary reports that most Armenians were loyal, the CUP leaders decided that the Armenians had to be eliminated to save the empire [104]\n\n\nSystematic deportations\nWe have been blamed for not making a distinction between guilty and innocent Armenians  [To do so] was impossible Because of the nature of things, one who was still innocent today could be guilty tomorrow The concern for the safety of Turkey simply had to silence all other concerns.\n\n\nAims\nWe have been blamed for not making a distinction between guilty and innocent Armenians  [To do so] was impossible Because of the nature of things, one who was still innocent today could be guilty tomorrow The concern for the safety of Turkey simply had to silence all other concerns.\n\n\nAdministrative organization\nOn 23 May 1915, Talaat ordered the deportation of all Armenians in Van, Bitlis, and Erzerum [150] [151] To grant a cover of legality to the deportation, already well underway in the eastern provinces and Cilicia, the Council of Ministers approved the Temporary Law of Deportation, which allowed authorities to deport anyone deemed suspect [151] [152] [153] On 21 June, Talaat ordered the deportation of all Armenians throughout the empire, even Adrianople, 2,000 kilometers (1,200 mi) from the Russian front [154] Following the elimination of the Armenian population in eastern Anatolia, in August 1915, the Armenians of western Anatolia and European Turkey were targeted for deportation Some areas with a very low Armenian population and some cities, including Constantinople, were partially spared [155] [156]\n\n\nDeath marches\nAlthough the majority of able-bodied Armenian men had been conscripted into the army, others deserted, paid the exemption tax, or fell outside the age range of conscription Unlike the earlier massacres of Ottoman Armenians, in 1915 Armenians were not usually killed in their villages, to avoid destruction of property or unauthorized looting Instead, the men were usually separated from the rest of the deportees during the first few days and executed Few resisted, believing it would put their families in greater danger [161] Boys above the age of twelve (sometimes fifteen) were treated as adult men [172] Execution sites were chosen for proximity to major roads and for rugged terrain, lakes, wells, or cisterns to facilitate the concealment or disposal of corpses [171] [173] [174] The convoys would stop at a nearby transit camp, where the escorts would demand a ransom from the Armenians Those unable to pay were murdered [161] Units of the Special Organization, often wearing gendarme uniforms, were stationed at the killing sites; escorting gendarmes often did not participate in killing [174]\n\n\nIslamization\nThe Islamization of Armenians, carried out as a systematic state policy involving the bureaucracy, police, judiciary, and clergy, was a major structural component of the genocide [184] [185] An estimated 100,000 to 200,000 Armenians were Islamized, [186] and it is estimated that as many as two million Turkish citizens in the early 21st century may have at least one Armenian grandparent [187] Some Armenians were allowed to convert to Islam and evade deportation, but the regime insisted on their destruction wherever their numbers exceeded the five to ten percent threshold, or there was a risk of them being able to preserve their nationality and culture [188] Talaat Pasha personally authorized conversion of Armenians and carefully tracked the loyalty of converted Armenians until the end of the war [189] Although the first and most important step was conversion to Islam, the process also required the eradication of Armenian names, language, and culture, and for women, immediate marriage to a Muslim [190] Although Islamization was the most feasible opportunity for survival, it also transgressed Armenian moral and social norms [191]\n\n\nConfiscation of property\nA secondary motivation for genocide was the destruction of the Armenian bourgeoisie to make room for a Turkish and Muslim middle class [128] and build a statist national economy controlled by Muslim Turks [163] [202] The campaign to Turkify the economy began in June 1914 with a law that obliged many non-Muslim merchants to hire Muslims Following the deportations, the businesses of the victims were taken over by Muslims who were often incompetent, leading to economic difficulties [203] The genocide had catastrophic effects on the Ottoman economy; Muslims were disadvantaged by the deportation of skilled professionals and entire districts fell into famine following their farmers' deportation [204] The Ottoman and Turkish governments passed a series of Abandoned Properties Laws to manage and redistribute property confiscated from Armenians [205] [206] Although the laws maintained that the state was simply administering the properties on behalf of the absent Armenians, there was no provision to return them to the owners—it was presumed that they had ceased to exist [207]\n\n\nDestination\nThe first arrivals in mid-1915 were accommodated in Aleppo From mid-November, the convoys were denied access to the city and redirected along the Baghdad Railway or the Euphrates towards Mosul The first transit camp was established at Sibil, east of Aleppo; one convoy would arrive each day while another would depart for Meskene or Deir ez-Zor [216] Dozens of concentration camps were set up in Syria and Upper Mesopotamia [217] By October 1915, some 870,000 deportees had reached Syria and Upper Mesopotamia Most were repeatedly transferred between camps, being held in each camp for a few weeks, until there were very few survivors [218] This strategy physically weakened the Armenians and spread disease, so much that some camps were shut down in late 1915 due to the threat of disease spreading to the Ottoman military [219] [220] In late 1915, the camps around Aleppo were liquidated and the survivors were forced to march to Ras al-Ayn; the camps around Ras al-Ayn were closed in early 1916 and the survivors sent to Deir ez-Zor [221]\n\n\nInternational reaction\nThe Ottoman Empire tried to prevent journalists and photographers from documenting the atrocities, threatening them with arrest [234] [235] Nevertheless, substantiated reports of mass killings were widely covered in Western newspapers [236] [237] On 24 May 1915, the Triple Entente (Russia, Britain, and France) formally condemned the Ottoman Empire for \"crimes against humanity and civilization\", and threatened to hold the perpetrators accountable [238] Witness testimony was published in books such as The Treatment of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire (1916) and Ambassador Morgenthau's Story (1918), raising public awareness of the genocide [239]\n\n\nAftermath\nIntentional, state-sponsored killing of Armenians mostly ceased by the end of January 1917, although sporadic massacres and starvation continued [246] Both contemporaries [247] [248] and later historians have estimated that around 1 million Armenians died during the genocide, [3] [249] with figures ranging from 600,000 to 1.5 million deaths [250] Between 800,000 and 1.2 million Armenians were deported, [250] [251] and contemporaries estimated that by late 1916 only 200,000 were still alive [250] As the British Army advanced in 1917 and 1918 northwards through the Levant, they liberated around 100,000 to 150,000 Armenians working for the Ottoman military under abysmal conditions, not including those held by Arab tribes [252]\n\n\nEnd of World War I\nIntentional, state-sponsored killing of Armenians mostly ceased by the end of January 1917, although sporadic massacres and starvation continued [246] Both contemporaries [247] [248] and later historians have estimated that around 1 million Armenians died during the genocide, [3] [249] with figures ranging from 600,000 to 1.5 million deaths [250] Between 800,000 and 1.2 million Armenians were deported, [250] [251] and contemporaries estimated that by late 1916 only 200,000 were still alive [250] As the British Army advanced in 1917 and 1918 northwards through the Levant, they liberated around 100,000 to 150,000 Armenians working for the Ottoman military under abysmal conditions, not including those held by Arab tribes [252]\n\n\nTrials\nFollowing the armistice, Allied governments championed the prosecution of Armenian genocide perpetrators [264] Grand Vizier Damat Ferid Pasha publicly recognized that 800,000 Ottoman citizens of Armenian origin had died as a result of state policy [265] and stated that \"humanity, civilizations are shuddering, and forever will shudder, in face of this tragedy\" [266] The postwar Ottoman government held the Ottoman Special Military Tribunal, by which it sought to pin the Armenian genocide onto the CUP leadership while exonerating the Ottoman Empire as a whole, therefore avoiding partition by the Allies [267] The court ruled that \"the crime of mass murder\" of Armenians was \"organized and carried out by the top leaders of CUP\" [268] Eighteen perpetrators (including Talaat, Enver, and Djemal) were sentenced to death, of whom only three were ultimately executed as the remainder had fled and were tried in absentia [269] [270] The 1920 Treaty of Sèvres, which awarded Armenia a large area in eastern Anatolia, eliminated the Ottoman government's purpose for holding the trials [271] Prosecution was hampered by a widespread belief among Turkish Muslims that the actions against the Armenians were not punishable crimes [163] Increasingly, the genocide was considered necessary and justified to establish a Turkish nation-state [272]\n\n\nTurkish War of Independence\nThe CUP regrouped as the Turkish nationalist movement to fight the Turkish War of Independence, [278] [279] [280] relying on the support of perpetrators of the genocide and those who had profited from it [281] [282] This movement saw the return of Armenian survivors as a mortal threat to its nationalist ambitions and the interests of its supporters The return of survivors was therefore impossible in most of Anatolia [138] [280] and thousands of Armenians who tried were murdered [283] Historian Raymond Kévorkian states that the war of independence was \"intended to complete the genocide by finally eradicating Armenian, Greek, and Syriac survivors\" [284] In 1920 Kâzım Karabekir, a Turkish general, invaded Armenia with orders \"to eliminate Armenia physically and politically\" [285] [286] Nearly 100,000 Armenians were massacred in Transcaucasia by the Turkish army and another 100,000 fled from Cilicia during the French withdrawal [286] According to Kévorkian, only the Soviet occupation of Armenia prevented another genocide [285]\n\n\nLegacy\nAccording to historian Margaret Lavinia Anderson, the Armenian genocide reached an \"iconic status\" as \"the apex of horrors conceivable\" before World War II [297] It was described by contemporaries as \"the murder of a nation\", \"race extermination\", [298] \"the greatest crime of the ages\", and \"the blackest page in modern history\" [299] [300] According to historian Stefan Ihrig, in Germany, the Nazis viewed post-1923 Turkey as a post-genocidal paradise and, \"incorporated the Armenian genocide, its 'lessons', tactics, and 'benefits', into their own worldview\" [301]\n\n\nTurkey\nIn the 1920s, Kurds and Alevis replaced Armenians as the perceived internal enemy of the Turkish state Militarism, weak rule of law, lack of minority rights, and especially the belief that Turkey is constantly under threat—thus justifying state violence—are among the main legacies of the genocide in Turkey [302] In postwar Turkey, the perpetrators of the genocide were hailed as martyrs of the national cause [280] Turkey's official denial of the Armenian genocide continues to rely on the CUP's justification of its actions The Turkish government maintains that the mass deportation of Armenians was a legitimate action to combat an existential threat to the empire, but that there was no intention to exterminate the Armenian people [303] [304] The government's position is supported by the majority of Turkish citizens [305] Many Kurds, who themselves have suffered political repression in Turkey, have recognized and condemned the genocide [306] [307]\n\n\nArmenia and Azerbaijan\nArmenian Genocide Remembrance Day is commemorated on 24 April each year in Armenia and abroad, the anniversary of the deportation of Armenian intellectuals [315] [316] On 24 April 1965, 100,000 Armenians protested in Yerevan, and diaspora Armenians demonstrated across the world in favor of recognition of the genocide and annexing land from Turkey [317] [315] A memorial was completed two years later, at Tsitsernakaberd above Yerevan [315] [318]\n\n\nInternational recognition\nIn response to continuing denial by the Turkish state, many Armenian diaspora activists have lobbied for international formal recognition of the Armenian genocide, an effort that has become a central concern of the Armenian diaspora [323] [324] From the 1970s onward, many countries avoided recognition to preserve good relations with Turkey [325] As of 2023 [update], 31 UN member states have formally recognized the genocide, along with Pope Francis and the European Parliament [326] [327] Azerbaijan, Pakistan, and Turkey explicitly deny the genocide.\n\n\nCultural depictions\nAfter meeting Armenian survivors in the Middle East, Austrian–Jewish writer Franz Werfel wrote The Forty Days of Musa Dagh, a fictionalized retelling of the successful Armenian uprising in Musa Dagh, as a warning of the dangers of Nazism [328] According to Ihrig, the book, released in 1933, is among the most important works of twentieth-century literature to address genocide and \"is still considered essential reading for Armenians worldwide\" [329] The genocide became a central theme in English-language Armenian-American literature [330] The first film about the Armenian genocide, Ravished Armenia, was

in English about \"Armenian_Genocide\" following this outline:\n\n\nBackground\nThe presence of Armenians in Anatolia has been documented since the sixth century BCE, about 1,500 years before the arrival of Turkmens under the Seljuk dynasty [5] The Kingdom of Armenia adopted Christianity as its national religion in the fourth century CE, establishing the Armenian Apostolic Church [6] Following the end of the Byzantine Empire in 1453, two Islamic empires—the Ottoman Empire and the Iranian Safavid Empire—contested Western Armenia, which was permanently separated from Eastern Armenia (held by the Safavids) by the 1639 Treaty of Zuhab [7] The Ottoman Empire was multiethnic and multireligious, [8] and its millet system offered non-Muslims a subordinate but protected place in society [9] Sharia law encoded Islamic superiority but guaranteed property rights and freedom of worship to non-Muslims (dhimmis) in exchange for a special tax [10]\n\n\nArmenians in the Ottoman Empire\nThe presence of Armenians in Anatolia has been documented since the sixth century BCE, about 1,500 years before the arrival of Turkmens under the Seljuk dynasty [5] The Kingdom of Armenia adopted Christianity as its national religion in the fourth century CE, establishing the Armenian Apostolic Church [6] Following the end of the Byzantine Empire in 1453, two Islamic empires—the Ottoman Empire and the Iranian Safavid Empire—contested Western Armenia, which was permanently separated from Eastern Armenia (held by the Safavids) by the 1639 Treaty of Zuhab [7] The Ottoman Empire was multiethnic and multireligious, [8] and its millet system offered non-Muslims a subordinate but protected place in society [9] Sharia law encoded Islamic superiority but guaranteed property rights and freedom of worship to non-Muslims (dhimmis) in exchange for a special tax [10]\n\n\nLand conflict and reforms\nArmenians in the eastern provinces lived in semi-feudal conditions and commonly encountered forced labor, illegal taxation, and unpunished crimes against them including robberies, murders, and sexual assaults [13] [14] Beginning in 1839, the Ottoman government issued a series of reforms to centralize power and equalize the status of Ottoman subjects regardless of religion The reforms to equalize the status of non-Muslims were strongly opposed by Islamic clergy and Muslims in general, and remained mostly theoretical [15] [16] [17] Because of the abolition of the Kurdish emirates in the mid-nineteenth century, the Ottoman government began to directly tax Armenian peasants who had previously paid taxes only to Kurdish landlords The latter continued to exact levies illegally [18] [19]\n\n\nYoung Turk Revolution\nAbdul Hamid's despotism prompted the formation of an opposition movement, the Young Turks, which sought to overthrow him and restore the 1876 Constitution of the Ottoman Empire, which he had suspended in 1877 [42] One faction of the Young Turks was the secret and revolutionary Committee of Union and Progress (CUP), based in Salonica, from which the charismatic conspirator Mehmed Talaat (later Talaat Pasha [b]) emerged as a leading member [44] Although skeptical of a growing, exclusionary Turkish nationalism in the Young Turk movement, the ARF decided to ally with the CUP in December 1907 [45] [46] In 1908, the CUP came to power in the Young Turk Revolution, which began with a string of CUP assassinations of leading officials in Macedonia [47] [48] Abdul Hamid was forced to reinstate the 1876 constitution and restore the Ottoman parliament, which was celebrated by Ottomans of all ethnicities and religions [49] [50] Security improved in parts of the eastern provinces after 1908 and the CUP took steps to reform the local gendarmerie, [51] although tensions remained high [52] Despite an agreement to reverse the land usurpation of the previous decades in the 1910 Salonica Accord between the ARF and the CUP, the latter made no efforts to carry this out [53] [54]\n\n\nBalkan Wars\nThe 1912 First Balkan War resulted in the loss of almost all of the empire's European territory [65] and the mass expulsion of Muslims from the Balkans [66] Ottoman Muslim society was incensed by the atrocities committed against Balkan Muslims, intensifying anti-Christian sentiment and leading to a desire for revenge [67] [68] Blame for the loss was assigned to all Christians, including the Ottoman Armenians, many of whom had fought on the Ottoman side [69] The Balkan Wars put an end to the Ottomanist movement for pluralism and coexistence; [70] instead, the CUP turned to an increasingly radical Turkish nationalism to preserve the empire [71] CUP leaders such as Talaat and Enver Pasha came to blame non-Muslim population concentrations in strategic areas for many of the empire's problems, concluding by mid-1914 that they were internal tumors to be excised [72] Of these, Ottoman Armenians were considered the most dangerous, because CUP leaders feared that their homeland in Anatolia—claimed as the last refuge of the Turkish nation—would break away from the empire as the Balkans had [73] [74] [71]\n\n\nOttoman entry into World War I\nA few days after the outbreak of World War I, the CUP concluded an alliance with Germany on 2 August 1914 [83] The same month, CUP representatives went to an ARF conference demanding that, in the event of war with Russia, the ARF incite Russian Armenians to intervene on the Ottoman side Instead, the delegates resolved that Armenians should fight for the countries of their citizenships [84] During its war preparations, the Ottoman government recruited thousands of prisoners to join the paramilitary Special Organization, [85] which initially focused on stirring up revolts among Muslims behind Russian lines beginning before the empire officially entered the war [86] On 29 October 1914, the empire entered World War I on the side of the Central Powers by launching a surprise attack on Russian ports in the Black Sea [87] Many Russian Armenians were enthusiastic about the war, but Ottoman Armenians were more ambivalent, afraid that supporting Russia would bring retaliation Organization of Armenian volunteer units by Russian Armenians, later joined by some Ottoman Armenian deserters, further increased Ottoman suspicions against their Armenian population [88]\n\n\nOnset of genocide\nMinister of War Enver Pasha took over command of the Ottoman armies for the invasion of Russian territory, and tried to encircle the Russian Caucasus Army at the Battle of Sarikamish, fought from December 1914 to January 1915 Unprepared for the harsh winter conditions, [100] his forces were routed, losing more than 60,000 men [101] The retreating Ottoman army destroyed dozens of Ottoman Armenian villages in Bitlis vilayet, massacring their inhabitants [97] Enver publicly blamed his defeat on Armenians who he claimed had actively sided with the Russians, a theory that became a consensus among CUP leaders [102] [103] Reports of local incidents such as weapons caches, severed telegraph lines, and occasional killings confirmed preexisting beliefs about Armenian treachery and fueled paranoia among CUP leaders that a coordinated Armenian conspiracy was plotting against the empire [104] [105] Discounting contrary reports that most Armenians were loyal, the CUP leaders decided that the Armenians had to be eliminated to save the empire [104]\n\n\nSystematic deportations\nWe have been blamed for not making a distinction between guilty and innocent Armenians  [To do so] was impossible Because of the nature of things, one who was still innocent today could be guilty tomorrow The concern for the safety of Turkey simply had to silence all other concerns.\n\n\nAims\nWe have been blamed for not making a distinction between guilty and innocent Armenians  [To do so] was impossible Because of the nature of things, one who was still innocent today could be guilty tomorrow The concern for the safety of Turkey simply had to silence all other concerns.\n\n\nAdministrative organization\nOn 23 May 1915, Talaat ordered the deportation of all Armenians in Van, Bitlis, and Erzerum [150] [151] To grant a cover of legality to the deportation, already well underway in the eastern provinces and Cilicia, the Council of Ministers approved the Temporary Law of Deportation, which allowed authorities to deport anyone deemed suspect [151] [152] [153] On 21 June, Talaat ordered the deportation of all Armenians throughout the empire, even Adrianople, 2,000 kilometers (1,200 mi) from the Russian front [154] Following the elimination of the Armenian population in eastern Anatolia, in August 1915, the Armenians of western Anatolia and European Turkey were targeted for deportation Some areas with a very low Armenian population and some cities, including Constantinople, were partially spared [155] [156]\n\n\nDeath marches\nAlthough the majority of able-bodied Armenian men had been conscripted into the army, others deserted, paid the exemption tax, or fell outside the age range of conscription Unlike the earlier massacres of Ottoman Armenians, in 1915 Armenians were not usually killed in their villages, to avoid destruction of property or unauthorized looting Instead, the men were usually separated from the rest of the deportees during the first few days and executed Few resisted, believing it would put their families in greater danger [161] Boys above the age of twelve (sometimes fifteen) were treated as adult men [172] Execution sites were chosen for proximity to major roads and for rugged terrain, lakes, wells, or cisterns to facilitate the concealment or disposal of corpses [171] [173] [174] The convoys would stop at a nearby transit camp, where the escorts would demand a ransom from the Armenians Those unable to pay were murdered [161] Units of the Special Organization, often wearing gendarme uniforms, were stationed at the killing sites; escorting gendarmes often did not participate in killing [174]\n\n\nIslamization\nThe Islamization of Armenians, carried out as a systematic state policy involving the bureaucracy, police, judiciary, and clergy, was a major structural component of the genocide [184] [185] An estimated 100,000 to 200,000 Armenians were Islamized, [186] and it is estimated that as many as two million Turkish citizens in the early 21st century may have at least one Armenian grandparent [187] Some Armenians were allowed to convert to Islam and evade deportation, but the regime insisted on their destruction wherever their numbers exceeded the five to ten percent threshold, or there was a risk of them being able to preserve their nationality and culture [188] Talaat Pasha personally authorized conversion of Armenians and carefully tracked the loyalty of converted Armenians until the end of the war [189] Although the first and most important step was conversion to Islam, the process also required the eradication of Armenian names, language, and culture, and for women, immediate marriage to a Muslim [190] Although Islamization was the most feasible opportunity for survival, it also transgressed Armenian moral and social norms [191]\n\n\nConfiscation of property\nA secondary motivation for genocide was the destruction of the Armenian bourgeoisie to make room for a Turkish and Muslim middle class [128] and build a statist national economy controlled by Muslim Turks [163] [202] The campaign to Turkify the economy began in June 1914 with a law that obliged many non-Muslim merchants to hire Muslims Following the deportations, the businesses of the victims were taken over by Muslims who were often incompetent, leading to economic difficulties [203] The genocide had catastrophic effects on the Ottoman economy; Muslims were disadvantaged by the deportation of skilled professionals and entire districts fell into famine following their farmers' deportation [204] The Ottoman and Turkish governments passed a series of Abandoned Properties Laws to manage and redistribute property confiscated from Armenians [205] [206] Although the laws maintained that the state was simply administering the properties on behalf of the absent Armenians, there was no provision to return them to the owners—it was presumed that they had ceased to exist [207]\n\n\nDestination\nThe first arrivals in mid-1915 were accommodated in Aleppo From mid-November, the convoys were denied access to the city and redirected along the Baghdad Railway or the Euphrates towards Mosul The first transit camp was established at Sibil, east of Aleppo; one convoy would arrive each day while another would depart for Meskene or Deir ez-Zor [216] Dozens of concentration camps were set up in Syria and Upper Mesopotamia [217] By October 1915, some 870,000 deportees had reached Syria and Upper Mesopotamia Most were repeatedly transferred between camps, being held in each camp for a few weeks, until there were very few survivors [218] This strategy physically weakened the Armenians and spread disease, so much that some camps were shut down in late 1915 due to the threat of disease spreading to the Ottoman military [219] [220] In late 1915, the camps around Aleppo were liquidated and the survivors were forced to march to Ras al-Ayn; the camps around Ras al-Ayn were closed in early 1916 and the survivors sent to Deir ez-Zor [221]\n\n\nInternational reaction\nThe Ottoman Empire tried to prevent journalists and photographers from documenting the atrocities, threatening them with arrest [234] [235] Nevertheless, substantiated reports of mass killings were widely covered in Western newspapers [236] [237] On 24 May 1915, the Triple Entente (Russia, Britain, and France) formally condemned the Ottoman Empire for \"crimes against humanity and civilization\", and threatened to hold the perpetrators accountable [238] Witness testimony was published in books such as The Treatment of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire (1916) and Ambassador Morgenthau's Story (1918), raising public awareness of the genocide [239]\n\n\nAftermath\nIntentional, state-sponsored killing of Armenians mostly ceased by the end of January 1917, although sporadic massacres and starvation continued [246] Both contemporaries [247] [248] and later historians have estimated that around 1 million Armenians died during the genocide, [3] [249] with figures ranging from 600,000 to 1.5 million deaths [250] Between 800,000 and 1.2 million Armenians were deported, [250] [251] and contemporaries estimated that by late 1916 only 200,000 were still alive [250] As the British Army advanced in 1917 and 1918 northwards through the Levant, they liberated around 100,000 to 150,000 Armenians working for the Ottoman military under abysmal conditions, not including those held by Arab tribes [252]\n\n\nEnd of World War I\nIntentional, state-sponsored killing of Armenians mostly ceased by the end of January 1917, although sporadic massacres and starvation continued [246] Both contemporaries [247] [248] and later historians have estimated that around 1 million Armenians died during the genocide, [3] [249] with figures ranging from 600,000 to 1.5 million deaths [250] Between 800,000 and 1.2 million Armenians were deported, [250] [251] and contemporaries estimated that by late 1916 only 200,000 were still alive [250] As the British Army advanced in 1917 and 1918 northwards through the Levant, they liberated around 100,000 to 150,000 Armenians working for the Ottoman military under abysmal conditions, not including those held by Arab tribes [252]\n\n\nTrials\nFollowing the armistice, Allied governments championed the prosecution of Armenian genocide perpetrators [264] Grand Vizier Damat Ferid Pasha publicly recognized that 800,000 Ottoman citizens of Armenian origin had died as a result of state policy [265] and stated that \"humanity, civilizations are shuddering, and forever will shudder, in face of this tragedy\" [266] The postwar Ottoman government held the Ottoman Special Military Tribunal, by which it sought to pin the Armenian genocide onto the CUP leadership while exonerating the Ottoman Empire as a whole, therefore avoiding partition by the Allies [267] The court ruled that \"the crime of mass murder\" of Armenians was \"organized and carried out by the top leaders of CUP\" [268] Eighteen perpetrators (including Talaat, Enver, and Djemal) were sentenced to death, of whom only three were ultimately executed as the remainder had fled and were tried in absentia [269] [270] The 1920 Treaty of Sèvres, which awarded Armenia a large area in eastern Anatolia, eliminated the Ottoman government's purpose for holding the trials [271] Prosecution was hampered by a widespread belief among Turkish Muslims that the actions against the Armenians were not punishable crimes [163] Increasingly, the genocide was considered necessary and justified to establish a Turkish nation-state [272]\n\n\nTurkish War of Independence\nThe CUP regrouped as the Turkish nationalist movement to fight the Turkish War of Independence, [278] [279] [280] relying on the support of perpetrators of the genocide and those who had profited from it [281] [282] This movement saw the return of Armenian survivors as a mortal threat to its nationalist ambitions and the interests of its supporters The return of survivors was therefore impossible in most of Anatolia [138] [280] and thousands of Armenians who tried were murdered [283] Historian Raymond Kévorkian states that the war of independence was \"intended to complete the genocide by finally eradicating Armenian, Greek, and Syriac survivors\" [284] In 1920 Kâzım Karabekir, a Turkish general, invaded Armenia with orders \"to eliminate Armenia physically and politically\" [285] [286] Nearly 100,000 Armenians were massacred in Transcaucasia by the Turkish army and another 100,000 fled from Cilicia during the French withdrawal [286] According to Kévorkian, only the Soviet occupation of Armenia prevented another genocide [285]\n\n\nLegacy\nAccording to historian Margaret Lavinia Anderson, the Armenian genocide reached an \"iconic status\" as \"the apex of horrors conceivable\" before World War II [297] It was described by contemporaries as \"the murder of a nation\", \"race extermination\", [298] \"the greatest crime of the ages\", and \"the blackest page in modern history\" [299] [300] According to historian Stefan Ihrig, in Germany, the Nazis viewed post-1923 Turkey as a post-genocidal paradise and, \"incorporated the Armenian genocide, its 'lessons', tactics, and 'benefits', into their own worldview\" [301]\n\n\nTurkey\nIn the 1920s, Kurds and Alevis replaced Armenians as the perceived internal enemy of the Turkish state Militarism, weak rule of law, lack of minority rights, and especially the belief that Turkey is constantly under threat—thus justifying state violence—are among the main legacies of the genocide in Turkey [302] In postwar Turkey, the perpetrators of the genocide were hailed as martyrs of the national cause [280] Turkey's official denial of the Armenian genocide continues to rely on the CUP's justification of its actions The Turkish government maintains that the mass deportation of Armenians was a legitimate action to combat an existential threat to the empire, but that there was no intention to exterminate the Armenian people [303] [304] The government's position is supported by the majority of Turkish citizens [305] Many Kurds, who themselves have suffered political repression in Turkey, have recognized and condemned the genocide [306] [307]\n\n\nArmenia and Azerbaijan\nArmenian Genocide Remembrance Day is commemorated on 24 April each year in Armenia and abroad, the anniversary of the deportation of Armenian intellectuals [315] [316] On 24 April 1965, 100,000 Armenians protested in Yerevan, and diaspora Armenians demonstrated across the world in favor of recognition of the genocide and annexing land from Turkey [317] [315] A memorial was completed two years later, at Tsitsernakaberd above Yerevan [315] [318]\n\n\nInternational recognition\nIn response to continuing denial by the Turkish state, many Armenian diaspora activists have lobbied for international formal recognition of the Armenian genocide, an effort that has become a central concern of the Armenian diaspora [323] [324] From the 1970s onward, many countries avoided recognition to preserve good relations with Turkey [325] As of 2023 [update], 31 UN member states have formally recognized the genocide, along with Pope Francis and the European Parliament [326] [327] Azerbaijan, Pakistan, and Turkey explicitly deny the genocide.\n\n\nCultural depictions\nAfter meeting Armenian survivors in the Middle East, Austrian–Jewish writer Franz Werfel wrote The Forty Days of Musa Dagh, a fictionalized retelling of the successful Armenian uprising in Musa Dagh, as a warning of the dangers of Nazism [328] According to Ihrig, the book, released in 1933, is among the most important works of twentieth-century literature to address genocide and \"is still considered essential reading for Armenians worldwide\" [329] The genocide became a central theme in English-language Armenian-American literature [330] The first film about the Armenian genocide, Ravished Armenia, was released in 1919 as a fundraiser for Near East Relief, based on the survival story of Aurora Mardiganian, who played herself [331] [332] [333] Since then more films about the genocide have been made, although it took several decades for any of them to reach a mass-market audience [334] The abstract expressionist paintings of Arshile Gorky were influenced by his experience of the genocide [335] More than 200 memorials have been erected in 32 countries to commemorate the event [336]\n\n\nArchives and historiography\nThe genocide is extensively documented in the archives of Germany, Austria, the United States, Russia, France, and the United Kingdom, [337] as well as the Ottoman archives, despite systematic purges of incriminating documents by Turkey [338] There are also thousands of eyewitness accounts from Western missionaries and Armenian survivors [339] [340] [341] Polish-Jewish lawyer Raphael Lemkin, who coined the term genocide in 1944, became interested in war crimes after reading about the 1921 trial of Soghomon Tehlirian for the assassination of Talaat Pasha Lemkin recognized the fate of the Armenians as one of the most significant genocides in the twentieth century [342] [343] Almost all historians and scholars outside Turkey, and an increasing number of Turkish scholars, recognize the destruction of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire as genocide [305]

reported on page 4 of the edition of May 30, 1907, that Wayne weighed 13 lb (around 6 kg) at birth Wayne claimed his middle name was soon changed from Robert to Michael when his parents decided to name their next son Robert, but extensive research has found no such legal change, although it might have been changed informally or the documentation may have been lost Wayne's legal name apparently remained Marion Robert Morrison his entire life [14] [15] although to this day his original name is almost always referred to as Marion Michael Morrison.\n\n\nCareer\n\nAs a favor to coach Jones, who had given silent Western film star Tom Mix tickets to USC games, director John Ford and Mix hired Wayne as a prop boy and extra [27] [28] Wayne later credited his walk, talk, and persona to his acquaintance with Wyatt Earp, who was good friends with Tom Mix [27] Wayne soon moved to bit parts, establishing a longtime friendship with the director who provided most of those roles, John Ford Early in this period, he had a minor, uncredited role as a guard in the 1926 film Bardelys the Magnificent Wayne also appeared with his USC teammates playing football in Brown of Harvard (1926), The Dropkick (1927), and Salute (1929) and Columbia's Maker of Men (filmed in 1930, released in 1931) [29]\n\nEarly works and first lead role\n\nAs a favor to coach Jones, who had given silent Western

(1929) and Columbia's Maker of Men (filmed in 1930, released in 1931) [29]\n\nSubsequent films, breakthrough, and war years\nAfter the commercial failure of The Big Trail, Wayne was relegated to small roles in A pictures, including Columbia's The Deceiver (1931), in which he played a corpse He appeared in the serial The Three Musketeers (1933), an updated version of the Alexandre Dumas novel in which the protagonists were soldiers in the French Foreign Legion in then-contemporary North Africa He played the lead, with his name over the title, in many low-budget Poverty Row Westerns, mostly at Monogram Pictures and serials for Mascot Pictures Corporation By Wayne's own estimation, he appeared in about 80 of these horse operas from 1930 to 1939 [34] In Riders of Destiny (1933), he became one of the first singing cowboys of film, albeit via dubbing [35] Wayne also appeared in some of the Three Mesquiteers Westerns, whose title was a play on the Dumas classic He was mentored by stuntmen in riding and other Western skills [29] Stuntman Yakima Canutt and Wayne developed and perfected stunts and onscreen fisticuffs techniques that are still in use [36] One of the main innovations with which Wayne is credited in these early Poverty Row Westerns is allowing the good guys to fight as convincingly as the bad guys, by not always making them fight clean Wayne claimed, \"Before I came along, it was standard practice that the hero must always fight clean The heavy was allowed to hit the hero in the head with a chair or throw a kerosene lamp at him or kick him in the stomach, but the hero could only knock the villain down politely and then wait until he rose I changed all that I threw chairs and lamps I fought hard and I fought dirty I fought to win.\" [37]\n\n\n1950s\nHe lost the leading role of Jimmy Ringo in The Gunfighter (1950) to Gregory Peck due to his refusal to work for Columbia Pictures because its chief, Harry Cohn, had mistreated him years before when he was a young contract player Cohn had bought the project for Wayne, but Wayne's grudge was too deep, and Cohn sold the script to Twentieth Century Fox, which cast Peck in the role Wayne badly wanted, but for which he refused to bend [50] [51]\n\n\n1960s\nIn 1960, Wayne directed and produced The Alamo portraying Davy Crockett, with Richard Widmark as Jim Bowie Wayne was nominated for an Oscar as the producer in the Best Picture category [57] That year Wayne also played the lead in Henry Hathaway's North to Alaska also starring Stewart Granger and Ernie Kovacs [58] In 1961, Wayne shared the lead with Stuart Whitman in Michael Curtiz's The Comancheros [59]\n\n\n1970s: later career\nOn June 24, 1970, Andrew V McLaglen's Chisum started to play in cinemas Wayne took the role of the owner of a cattle ranch, who finds out that a businessman is trying to own neighboring land illegally [79] On September 16, Howard Hawks' Rio Lobo premiered Wayne played Col Cord McNally, who confronts Confederate soldiers who stole a shipment of gold at the end of the Civil War [80] This was another remake of Rio Bravo albeit without a second lead the box office caliber of Dean Martin or Robert Mitchum.\n\n\nPersonal life\nWayne was married three times and divorced twice His wives included one of Spanish American descent, Josephine Alicia Saenz, and two from Latin America, Esperanza Baur and Pilar Pallete He had four children with Josephine: Michael Wayne (1934–2003), Mary Antonia \"Toni\" Wayne LaCava (1936–2000), Patrick Wayne (born 1939), and Melinda Wayne Munoz (1940–2022) He had three more children with Pilar: Aissa Wayne (born 1956), John Ethan Wayne (born 1962), and Marisa Wayne (born 1966).\n\n\nPolitical and social views\nThroughout most of his life, Wayne was a vocally prominent conservative Republican in Hollywood, supporting anti-communist positions [113] However, he voted for Democratic President Franklin D Roosevelt in the 1936 presidential election and expressed admiration for Roosevelt's successor, fellow Democratic President Harry S Truman, despite having supported Republican candidate Thomas E Dewey in 1948 [114] [115] He took part in creating the conservative Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals in February 1944 before being elected its president in 1949 An ardent anti-communist and vocal supporter of the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), he made Big Jim McLain (1952) with himself as a HUAC investigator to demonstrate his support for the cause of anti-communism His personal views found expression as a proactive inside enforcer of the \"Black List\", denying employment and undermining careers of many actors and writers who had expressed their personal political beliefs earlier in life Soviet leader Joseph Stalin is alleged to have said that Wayne should be assassinated for his frequently espoused anti-communist politics, despite being a fan of his movies [116] [117] Wayne was a supporter of Senator Joseph McCarthy [118]\n\n\n1971 Playboy interview\nIn May 1971, Playboy magazine published an interview with Wayne, in which he expressed his support for the Vietnam War, [133] and made headlines for his

hired Wayne as a prop boy and extra [27] [28] Wayne later credited his walk, talk, and persona to his acquaintance with Wyatt Earp, who was good friends with Tom Mix [27] Wayne soon moved to bit parts, establishing a longtime friendship with the director who provided most of those roles, John Ford Early in this period, he had a minor, uncredited role as a guard in the 1926 film Bardelys the

perfected stunts and onscreen fisticuffs techniques that are still in use [36] One of the main innovations with which Wayne is credited in these early Poverty Row Westerns is allowing the good guys to fight as convincingly as the bad guys, by not always making them fight clean Wayne claimed, \"Before I came along, it was standard practice that the hero must always fight clean The heavy was allowed to hit the hero in the head with a chair or throw a kerosene lamp at him or kick him in the stomach, but the hero could only knock the villain down politely and then wait until he rose I changed all that I threw chairs and lamps I fought hard and I fought dirty I fought to win.\" [37]\n\n\n1950s\nHe lost the leading role of Jimmy Ringo in The Gunfighter (1950) to Gregory Peck due to his refusal to work for Columbia Pictures because its chief, Harry Cohn, had mistreated him years before when he was a young contract player Cohn had bought the project for Wayne, but Wayne's grudge was too deep,

Empire, founded in 1526, was the dominant power in the Indian subcontinent during the mid-16th century [93] Growing apprehensive of the power of the Mughal emperor Humayun, Sultan Bahadur Shah of Gujarat was obliged to sign the Treaty of Bassein with the Portuguese Empire on 23 December 1534 According to the treaty, the Seven Islands of Bombay, the nearby strategic town of Bassein and its dependencies were offered to the Portuguese The territories were later surrendered on 25 October 1535 [94]\n\n\nIndependent India\nAfter India's independence in 1947, the territory of the Bombay Presidency retained by India was restructured into Bombay State The area of Bombay State increased, after several erstwhile princely states that joined the Indian union were integrated into the state Subsequently, the city became the capital of Bombay State [129] In April 1950, Municipal limits of Mumbai were expanded by merging the Mumbai Suburban District and Mumbai City to form the Greater Mumbai Municipal Corporation [130]\n\n\nGeography\nMumbai is on a narrow peninsula on the southwest of Salsette Island, which lies between the Arabian Sea to the west, Thane Creek to the east and Vasai Creek to the north Mumbai's suburban district occupies most of the island Navi Mumbai is east of Thane Creek and Thane is north of Vasai Creek Mumbai consists of two distinct regions: Mumbai City district and Mumbai Suburban district, which form two separate revenue districts of Maharashtra [153] The city district region is also commonly referred to as the Island City or South Mumbai [36] The total area of Mumbai is 603.4 square kilometres (233.0 sq mi) [154] Of this, the island city spans 67.79 square kilometres (26.17 sq mi), while the suburban district spans 370 square kilometres (140 sq mi), together accounting for 437.71 square kilometres (169.00 sq mi) under the administration of Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) The remaining areas belong to various Defence establishments, the Mumbai Port Trust, the Atomic Energy Commission and the Borivali National Park, which are out of the jurisdiction of the MCGM [155] The Mumbai Metropolitan Region which includes portions of Thane, Palghar and Raigad districts in addition to Greater Mumbai, covers an area of 4,355 square kilometres (1,681 sq mi) [9]\nMumbai lies at the mouth of the Ulhas River on the western coast of India, in the coastal region known as the Konkan It sits on Salsette Island (Sashti Island), which it partially shares with the Thane district [156] Mumbai is bounded by the Arabian Sea to the west [157] Many parts of the city lie just above sea level, with elevations ranging from 10 to 15 metres (33 to 49 ft); [158] the city has an average elevation of 14 metres (46 ft) [159] Northern Mumbai (Salsette) is hilly, [160] and the highest point in the city is 450 metres (1,480 ft) at Salsette in the Powai–Kanheri ranges [161] The Sanjay Gandhi National Park (Borivali National Park) is located partly in the Mumbai suburban district, and partly in the Thane district, and it extends over an area of 103.09 square kilometres (39.80 sq mi) [162]\n\n\nClimate\nMumbai has an extreme tropical wet and dry climate (Aw) under the Köppen climate classification, although the central and northern suburbs have a tropical monsoon climate (Am) with even heavier wet season rainfall Mumbai has a virtually rainless period extending from October to May and an extremely wet period peaking in July [172] A cooler season from December to February is followed by a hotter season from March to May The period from June to about the end of September constitutes the south west monsoon season, and October and November form the post-monsoon season [173]\n\n\nAir pollution\nAir pollution is a major issue in Mumbai [196] [197] [198] According to the 2016 World Health Organization Global Urban Ambient Air Pollution Database, [199] the annual average PM2.5 concentration in 2013 was 63 μg/m3, which is 6.3 times higher than that recommended by the WHO Air Quality Guidelines [200] for the annual mean PM2.5 The Central Pollution Control Board for the Government of India and the Consulate General of the United States, Mumbai monitor and publicly share real-time air quality data [201] [202] In December 2019, IIT Bombay, in partnership with the McKelvey School of Engineering of Washington University in St Louis launched the Aerosol and Air Quality Research Facility to study air pollution in Mumbai, among other Indian cities [203]\n\n\nEconomy\nMumbai, sometimes described as the New York of India, [34] is India's most populous city and is the financial and commercial capital of the country as it generates 6.16% of the total GDP [36] [150] [205] It serves as an economic hub of India; as of 2006, Mumbai contributed 10% of the nation's factory employment, 25% of industrial output, 33% of income tax collections, 60% of customs duty collections, 20% of central excise tax collections, 40% of foreign trade, and ₹40 billion (equivalent to ₹130 billion or US$1.5 billion in 2023) in corporate taxes [206] Along with the rest of India, Mumbai has witnessed an economic boom since the liberalisation of 1991, the finance boom in the mid-nineties and the IT, export, services and outsourcing boom in the 2000s [207]\n\n\nIncome inequality\nHowever, it is important to acknowledge that Mumbai faces important challenges regarding income inequality Despite having the largest concentration of billionaires out of any city in Asia, Mumbai is one of the most unequal cities in the world [223] Like other Indian metropolitan cities, Mumbai is in desperate need of affordable housing infrastructure for its lower and lower-middle class citizens The median rental cost of a one-bedroom apartment in Mumbai proper is around ₹30,000, [224] while according to ResearchGate, 25% of Mumbai households have a monthly income of less than ₹12,500 [225] The overall average salary in Mumbai is ₹45,000 [224] This means that the vast majority of conventional housing is out of bounds for many Mumbai residents, leading many to rely on informal housing.\n\n\nGovernment and

both government agencies as well as private partners [284] Hovercraft services plied briefly in the late 1990s between the Gateway of India and CBD Belapur in Navi Mumbai They were subsequently scrapped due to lack of adequate infrastructure [285]\n\n\nRoads\nMumbai is served by National Highway 48, National Highway 66, National Highway 160 and National Highway 61 [286] The Mumbai–Chennai

extensive wet and dry dock accommodation facilities [311] Jawaharlal Nehru Port, commissioned on 26 May 1989, is the busiest and most modern major port in India [312] It handles 55–60% of the country's total containerised cargo [citation needed] Ferries from Ferry Wharf in Mazagaon allow access to islands near the city [313]\n\n\nUtility services\nUnder colonial rule, tanks were the only source of water in Mumbai, with many localities having been named after them The MCGM supplies potable water to the city from six lakes, [314] [315] most of which comes from the Tulsi and Vihar lakes The Tansa lake supplies water to the western suburbs and parts of the island city along the Western Railway [316] The water is filtered at Bhandup, [316] which is Asia's largest water filtration plant [317] [318] [319] India's first underground water tunnel was completed in Mumbai to supply water to the Bhandup filtration plant [320] [321]\n\n\nDemographics\nAccording to the 2011 census, the

the city are affiliated with the University of Mumbai, one of the largest universities in the world in terms of the number of graduates [389]\n\n\nCulture\nMumbai's culture offers a blend of traditional and cosmopolitan festivals, food, entertainment, and night life The city's cosmopolitan and urban-centric modern cultural offerings are comparable to other world capitals Mumbai bears the distinction of being the most cosmopolitan city of India Its history as a major trading centre and the expansion of an educated middle class has led to a diverse range of cultures, religions, and cuisines coexisting in the city The variety and abundance of restaurants, cinemas, theatres, sports events and museums are a product of Mumbai's unique cosmopolitan culture [408]\n\n\nArchitecture\nThe architecture of the city is a blend of Gothic Revival, Indo-Saracenic, Art Deco, and other contemporary styles Most of the buildings during the British period, such as the Victoria Terminus and University of Mumbai, were built in Gothic Revival style [429] Their architectural features include a variety of European influences such as German gables, Dutch roofs, Swiss timbering, Romance arches, Tudor casements, and traditional Indian features [430] There are also a few Indo-Saracenic styled buildings such as the Gateway of India [431] Art Deco styled landmarks can

York [434] [433]\n\n\nCityscape\nMumbai's cityscape consists of a variety of tall buildings and structures, most of which have been built in the last two decades There was a significant lull in construction projects since the mid-1990s after which construction projects began taking the skyline upwards, with a major acceleration in the pace of development since 2000, when the Lower Parel area began developing [435] \nMumbai with a commanding 77% share of tall buildings in India, is poised to maintain its position as the frontrunner in tall building construction due to its ability to command premium prices compared to other cities, thereby ensuring the economic viability of such developments within the city [436]\nMumbai has more residential tall buildings rather than commercial, unlike the trend globally Limited land resources and an exponential increase in urban population were the primary reasons for Mumbai's vertical growth compared to other Tier 1 Indian cities

It is the capital of the state and the financial, commercial, and entertainment capital of India. Mumbai is also known as the City of Dreams, the City of Gold, and the Queen of Cities. It is a cosmopolitan city with a diverse population of people from different cultures, religions, and languages.\n\n# Etymology\n\nThe name Mumbai (Marathi: मुंबई) originated from Mumbā or Mahā-Ambā—the name of the patron Hindu goddess (kuladevata) Mumbadevi of the native Koli community. The name \"Mumbai\" is a blend of the Sanskrit words \"Mumba\" and \"Aai,\" which means \"mother\" in the Marathi language. The Koli community, which hails from Kathiawar and Central Gujarat, is believed to have introduced their deity Mumba from Kathiawar, where her worship continues to this day.\n\n# People from Mumbai\n\nA resident of Mumbai is called Mumbaikar (pronounced  [ˈmumbəikəɾ]) in Marathi, which means \"a resident of Mumbai.\" The term had been in use for quite some time but gained popularity after the official name change to Mumbai. Older terms such as Bombayite are also used.\n\n# History\n\nMumbai is built on what was once an archipelago of seven islands: Isle of Bombay, Parel, Mazagaon, Mahim, Colaba, Worli, and Old Woman's Island (also known as Little Colaba). It is not exactly known when these islands were first inhabited. Pleistocene sediments found along the coastal areas around Kandivali in northern Mumbai suggest that the islands were inhabited since the South Asian Stone Age. Perhaps at the beginning of the Common Era, or possibly earlier, they came to be occupied by the Koli fishing community.\n\n## Early history\n\nThe Mughal Empire, founded in 1526, was the dominant power in the Indian subcontinent during the mid-16th century.

It is operated by the Central Railway and Western Railway zones of the Indian Railways. Mumbai's suburban rail systems carried a total of 63 lakh (6.3 million) passengers every day in 2007. Trains are overcrowded during peak hours, with twelve-car trains of rated capacity 1,700 passengers, actually carrying around 4,500 passengers at peak hours. The Mumbai rail network is spread at an expanse of 319 route kilometers (198 miles), 191 rakes (train-sets) of 12 car and 15 car composition are utilized to run a total of 2,226 train services in the city.\n\n## Bus\n\nMumbai's bus services carried over 5.5 million passengers per day in 2008, which dropped to 2.8 million in 2015. Public buses run by BEST cover almost all parts of the metropolis, as well as parts of Navi Mumbai, Mira-Bhayandar, and Thane. The BEST operates a total of 4,608 buses, with CCTV cameras installed, ferrying 4.5 million passengers daily over 390 routes. Its fleet consists of single-decker, double-decker, vestibule, low-floor, disabled-friendly, air-conditioned, and Euro III compliant diesel and compressed natural gas powered buses. BEST introduced air-conditioned buses in 1998. BEST buses are red in color, based originally on the Routemaster buses of London. Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC), also known as ST, buses provide intercity transport connecting Mumbai with other towns and cities of Maharashtra and nearby states. The Navi Mumbai Municipal Transport (NMMT) and Thane Municipal Transport (TMT) also operate their buses in Mumbai, connecting various nodes of Navi Mumbai and Thane to parts of Mumbai.\n\n## Water\n\nWater transport in Mumbai consists of ferries, hovercraft, and catamarans. Services are provided by both government agencies and private partners. Hovercraft services plied briefly in the late 1990s between the Gateway of India and CBD Belapur in Navi Mumbai. They were subsequently scrapped due to lack of adequate infrastructure.\n\n## Road\n\nMumbai is served by National Highway 48, National Highway 66, National Highway 160, and National Highway 61. The Mumbai–Chennai and Mumbai–Delhi prongs of the Golden Quadrilateral system of National Highways start from the city. The Mumbai-Pune Expressway was the first expressway built in India. The Eastern Freeway was opened in 2013. The Bandra-Worli Sea Link bridge, along with Mahim Causeway, links the island city to the western suburbs. The three major road arteries of the city are the Eastern Express Highway from Sion to Thane, the Sion Panvel Expressway from Sion to Panvel, and the Western Express Highway from Bandra to Bhayander. The 21.8 km (14-mile) long Mumbai Trans Harbour Link was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 12 January 2024, connecting Mumbai with Navi Mumbai.\n\n## Air\n\nThe Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (formerly Sahar International Airport) is the main aviation hub in the city and the second-busiest airport in India in terms of passenger traffic. It handled 52.8 million passengers in the Financial Year 2024, an increase of 16 percent in passenger traffic over the previous FY. An upgrade plan was initiated in 2006, targeted at increasing the capacity of the airport to handle up to 40 million passengers annually. The new terminal T2 was opened in February 2014.\n\n## Sea\n\nMumbai is served by two major ports, Mumbai Port Trust and Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust, which lies just across the creek in Navi Mumbai. Mumbai Port has one of the best natural harbors in the world and has extensive wet and dry dock accommodation facilities. Jawaharlal Nehru Port, commissioned on 26 May 1989, is the busiest and most modern major port in India. It handles 55-60% of the country's total containerized cargo. Ferries from Ferry Wharf in Mazagaon allow access to islands near the city.\n\n# Utility services\n\nUnder colonial rule, tanks were the only source of water in Mumbai, with many localities having been named after them. The MCGM supplies potable water to the city from six lakes, most of which comes from the Tulsi and Vihar lakes. The Tansa lake supplies water to the western suburbs and parts of the island city along the Western Railway. The water is filtered at Bhandup, which is Asia's largest water filtration plant. India's first underground water tunnel was completed in Mumbai to supply water to the Bhandup filtration plant.\n\n# Demographics\n\nAccording to the 2011 census, the population of Mumbai city was 12,479,608. The population density is estimated to be about 20,482 inhabitants per square kilometer (53,050/sq mi). The living space is 4.5 square meters (48 sq ft) per person. Mumbai Metropolitan Region was home to 20,748,395 people by 2011. Greater Mumbai, the area under the administration of the MCGM, has a literacy rate of 94.7%, higher than the national average of 86.7%. The number of slum-dwellers in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region is estimated to be 90 lakh (9 million), up from 60 lakh (6 million) in 2001, which constitutes approximately 38.5% of the region.\n\n# Ethnic groups and religions\n\nThe religious groups represented in Greater Mumbai as of 2011 include Hindus (65.99%), Muslims (20.65%), Buddhists (4.85%), Jains (4.10%), Christians (3.27%), and Sikhs (0.49%). The linguistic/ethnic demographics in the Greater Mumbai Area are: Maharashtrians (32%), Gujaratis (20%), and the rest hail from other parts of India.\n\n# Language\n\nLanguages in Mumbai (2011) include: Marathi (51.13%), Hindi (14.1%), Gujarati (11.4%), English (3.3%), Urdu (3.0%), Sindhi (1.0%), Punjabi (0.8%), Telugu (0.7%), Malayalam (0.5%), and others (14.6%).\n\n# Education\n\nSchools in Mumbai are either \"municipal schools\" (run by the MCGM) or private schools (run by trusts or individuals), which in some cases receive financial aid from the government. The schools are affiliated with either of the following boards: the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education or the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE).\n\n# Higher education\n\nUnder the 10+2+3/4 plan, students complete ten years of schooling and then enrol for two years in junior college, where they select one of three streams: arts, commerce, or science. This is followed by either a general degree course in a chosen field of study, or a professional degree course, such as law, engineering, and medicine. Most colleges in the city are affiliated with the University of Mumbai, one of the largest universities in the world in terms of the number of graduates.\n\n# Culture\n\nMumbai's culture offers a blend of traditional and cosmopolitan festivals, food, entertainment, and night life. The city's cosmopolitan and urban-centric modern cultural offerings are comparable to other world capitals. Mumbai bears the distinction of being the most cosmopolitan city of India. Its history as a major trading centre and the expansion of an educated middle class has led to a diverse range of cultures, religions, and cuisines coexisting in the city. The variety and abundance of restaurants, cinemas, theatres, sports events, and museums are a product of Mumbai's unique cosmopolitan culture.\n\n# Architecture\n\nThe architecture of the city is a blend of Gothic Revival, Indo-Saracenic, Art Deco, and other contemporary styles. Most of the buildings during the British period, such as the Victoria Terminus and University of Mumbai, were built in Gothic Revival style. Their architectural features include a variety of European influences such as German gables, Dutch roofs, Swiss timbering, Romance arches, Tudor casements, and traditional Indian features. There are also a few Indo-Saracenic styled buildings such as the Gateway of India. Art Deco styled landmarks can be found along Marine Drive and west of the Oval Maidan. Mumbai has the second-highest number of Art Deco buildings in the world after Miami. In the newer suburbs, modern buildings dominate the landscape. Mumbai has by far the highest number of skyscrapers in India, with 956 existing skyscrapers and 272 under construction as of 2009.\n\n# Cityscape\n\nMumbai's cityscape consists of a variety of tall buildings and structures, most of which have been built in the last two decades. There was a significant lull in construction projects since the mid-1990s after which construction projects began taking the skyline upwards, with a major acceleration in the pace of development since 2000, when the Lower Parel area began developing. Mumbai with a commanding 77% share of tall buildings in India, is poised to maintain its position as the frontrunner in tall building construction due to its ability to command premium prices compared to other cities, thereby ensuring the economic viability of such developments within the city. Mumbai has more residential tall buildings rather than commercial, unlike the trend globally. Limited land resources and an exponential increase in urban population were the primary reasons for Mumbai's vertical growth compared to other Tier 1 Indian cities.\n\n# Food\n\nBollywood, the Hindi film industry based in Mumbai, produces around 150-200 films every year. The name Bollywood is a blend of Bombay and Hollywood. The 2000s saw a growth in Bollywood's popularity overseas. This led filmmaking to new heights in terms of quality, cinematography, and innovative storylines as well as technical advances such as special effects and animation. Studios in Goregaon, including Film City, are the location for most movie sets. The city also hosts the Marathi film industry, which has seen increased popularity in recent years, and TV production companies. Mumbai is a hub of Indian filmmaking. Several other Indian language films such as Bengali, Bhojpuri, Gujarati, Malayalam, Tamil, Kannada, Tel", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Mumbai\" following this outline:\n\n\nEtymology\nThe name Mumbai (Marathi: मुंबई) originated from Mumbā or Mahā-Ambā—the name of the patron Hindu goddess (kuladevata) Mumbadevi of the native Koli community [40]—and from ā'ī, meaning \"mother\" in the Marathi language, which is the mother tongue of the Koli people and the official language of Maharashtra [25] [41] According to certain accounts, the Koli community, which hails from Kathiawar and Central Gujarat, is believed to have introduced their deity Mumba from Kathiawar (Gujarat), where her worship continues to this day [26] [27] However, other sources disagree that Mumbai's name was derived from the goddess Mumba [27]\n\n\nPeople from Mumbai\nA resident of Mumbai is called Mumbaikar (pronounced  [ˈmumbəikəɾ]) in Marathi, in which the suffix -kar means a 'resident of' The term had been in use for quite some time but it gained popularity after the official name change to Mumbai [64] Older terms such as Bombayite are also used [65] [66]\n\n\nHistory\nMumbai is built on what was once an archipelago of seven islands: Isle of Bombay, Parel, Mazagaon, Mahim, Colaba, Worli, and Old Woman's Island (also known as Little Colaba) [67] It is not exactly known when these islands were first inhabited Pleistocene sediments found along the coastal areas around Kandivali in northern Mumbai suggest that the islands were inhabited since the South Asian Stone Age [68] Perhaps at the beginning of the Common Era, or possibly earlier, they came to be occupied by the Koli fishing community [69] [70]\n\n\nEarly history\nMumbai is built on what

beginning of the Common Era, or possibly earlier, they came to be occupied by the Koli fishing community [69] [70]\n\n\nPortuguese and British rule\nThe Mughal Empire, founded in 1526, was the dominant power in the Indian subcontinent during the mid-16th century [93] Growing apprehensive of the power of the Mughal emperor Humayun, Sultan Bahadur Shah of Gujarat was obliged to sign the Treaty of Bassein with the Portuguese Empire on 23 December 1534 According to the treaty, the Seven Islands of Bombay, the nearby strategic town of Bassein and its dependencies were offered to the Portuguese The territories were later surrendered on 25 October 1535 [94]\n\n\nIndependent India\nAfter India's independence in 1947, the territory of the Bombay Presidency retained by India was restructured into Bombay State The area of Bombay State increased, after several erstwhile princely states that joined the Indian union were integrated into the state Subsequently, the city became the capital of Bombay State [129] In April 1950, Municipal limits of Mumbai were expanded by merging the Mumbai Suburban District and Mumbai City to form the Greater Mumbai Municipal Corporation [130]\n\n\nGeography\nMumbai is on a narrow peninsula on the southwest of Salsette Island, which lies between the Arabian Sea to the west, Thane Creek to the east and Vasai Creek to the north Mumbai's suburban district occupies most of the island Navi Mumbai is east of Thane Creek and Thane is north of Vasai Creek Mumbai consists of two distinct regions: Mumbai City district and Mumbai Suburban district, which form two separate revenue districts of Maharashtra [153] The city district region is also commonly referred to as the Island City or South Mumbai [36] The total area of Mumbai is 603.4 square kilometres (233.0 sq mi) [154] Of this, the island city spans 67.79 square kilometres (26.17 sq mi), while the suburban district spans 370 square kilometres (140 sq mi), together accounting for 437.71 square kilometres (169.00 sq mi) under the administration of Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) The remaining areas belong to various Defence establishments, the Mumbai Port Trust, the Atomic Energy Commission and the Borivali National Park, which are out of the jurisdiction of the MCGM [155] The Mumbai Metropolitan Region which includes portions of Thane, Palghar and Raigad districts in addition to Greater Mumbai, covers an area of 4,355 square kilometres (1,681 sq mi) [9]\nMumbai lies at the mouth of the Ulhas River on the western coast of India, in the coastal region known as the Konkan It sits on Salsette Island (Sashti Island), which it partially shares with the Thane district [156] Mumbai is bounded by the Arabian Sea to the west [157] Many parts of the city lie just above sea level, with elevations ranging from 10 to 15 metres (33 to 49 ft); [158] the city has an average elevation of 14 metres (46 ft) [159] Northern Mumbai (Salsette) is hilly, [160] and the highest point in the city is 450 metres (1,480 ft) at Salsette in the Powai–Kanheri ranges [161] The Sanjay Gandhi National Park (Borivali National Park) is located partly in the Mumbai suburban district, and partly in the Thane district, and it extends over an area of 103.09 square kilometres (39.80 sq mi) [162]\n\n\nClimate\nMumbai has an extreme tropical wet and dry climate (Aw) under the Köppen climate classification, although the central and northern suburbs have a tropical monsoon climate (Am) with even heavier wet season rainfall Mumbai has a virtually rainless period extending from October to May and an extremely wet period peaking in July [172] A cooler season from December to February is followed by a hotter season from March to May The period from June to about the end of September constitutes the south west monsoon season, and October and November form the post-monsoon season [173]\n\n\nAir pollution\nAir pollution is a major issue in Mumbai [196] [197] [198] According to the 2016 World Health Organization Global Urban Ambient Air Pollution Database, [199] the annual average PM2.5 concentration in 2013 was 63 μg/m3, which is 6.3 times higher than that recommended by the WHO Air Quality Guidelines [200] for the annual mean PM2.5 The Central Pollution Control Board for the Government of India and the Consulate General of the United States, Mumbai monitor and publicly share real-time air quality data [201] [202] In December 2019, IIT Bombay, in partnership with the McKelvey School of Engineering of Washington University in St Louis launched the Aerosol and Air Quality Research Facility to study air pollution in Mumbai, among other Indian cities [203]\n\n\nEconomy\nMumbai, sometimes described as the New York of India, [34] is India's most populous city and is the financial and commercial capital of the country as it generates 6.16% of the total GDP [36] [150] [205] It serves as an economic hub of India; as of 2006, Mumbai contributed 10% of the nation's factory employment, 25% of industrial output, 33% of income tax collections, 60% of customs duty collections, 20% of central excise tax collections, 40% of foreign trade, and ₹40 billion (equivalent to ₹130 billion or US$1.5 billion in 2023) in corporate taxes [206] Along with the rest of India, Mumbai has witnessed an economic boom since the liberalisation of 1991, the finance boom in the mid-nineties and the IT, export, services and outsourcing boom in the 2000s [207]\n\n\nIncome inequality\nHowever, it is important to acknowledge that Mumbai faces important challenges regarding income inequality Despite having the largest concentration of billionaires out of any city in Asia, Mumbai is one of the most unequal cities in the world [223] Like other Indian metropolitan cities, Mumbai is in desperate need of affordable housing infrastructure for its lower and lower-middle class citizens The median rental cost of a one-bedroom apartment in Mumbai proper is around ₹30,000, [224] while according to ResearchGate, 25% of Mumbai households have a monthly income of less than ₹12,500 [225] The overall average salary in Mumbai is ₹45,000 [224] This means that the vast majority of conventional housing is out of bounds for many Mumbai residents, leading many to rely on informal housing.\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nGreater Mumbai (or Brihanmumbai), an area of 603 km2 (233 sq mi), [226] consisting of the Mumbai City and Mumbai Suburban districts, extends from Colaba in the south, to Mulund and Dahisar in the north, and Mankhurd in the east Its population as per the 2011 census was 12,442,373 [227]\n\n\nCivic administration\nGreater Mumbai (or Brihanmumbai), an area of 603 km2 (233 sq mi), [226] consisting of the Mumbai City and Mumbai

politics\nMumbai had been a traditional stronghold and birthplace of the Indian National Congress, also known as the Congress Party [237] The first session of the Indian National Congress was held in Mumbai from 28 to 31 December 1885 [238] The city played host to the Indian National Congress six times during its first 50 years, and became a strong base for the Indian independence movement during the 20th century [239]\n\n\nTransport\nPublic transport systems in Mumbai include the Mumbai Suburban Railway, Monorail, Metro, Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) buses, black-and-yellow meter taxis, auto rickshaws and ferries Suburban railway and BEST bus services together accounted for about 88% of the passenger traffic in 2008 [256] Auto rickshaws are allowed to

{"title": "Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "content": "\nEarly life\nDiana Frances Spencer was born on 1 July 1961, the fourth of five children of John Spencer, Viscount Althorp (1924–1992), and Frances Spencer, Viscountess Althorp (née Roche; 1936–2004) [2] She was delivered at Park House, Sandringham, Norfolk [3] The Spencer family had been closely allied with the British royal family for several generations; [4] her grandmothers, Cynthia Spencer, Countess Spencer, and Ruth Roche, Baroness Fermoy, had served as ladies-in-waiting to Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother [5] Her parents were hoping for a boy to carry on the family line, and no name was chosen for a week until they settled on Diana Frances after her mother and Lady Diana Spencer, a many-times-great-aunt who was also a prospective Princess of Wales as a potential bride for Frederick, Prince of Wales [6] Within the family, she was also known informally as \"Duch\", a reference to her duchess-like attitude in childhood [7]\n\n\nEducation and career\nDiana was initially home-schooled under the supervision of her governess, Gertrude Allen [21] She began her formal education at Silfield Private School in King's Lynn, Norfolk, and moved to Riddlesworth Hall School, an all-girls boarding school near Thetford, when she was nine [22] She joined her sisters at West Heath Girls' School in Sevenoaks, Kent, in 1973 [23] She did not perform well academically, failing her O-levels twice [24] [25] Her outstanding community spirit was recognised with an award from West Heath [26] She left West Heath when she was sixteen [27] Her brother Charles recalls her as being quite shy up until that time [28] She demonstrated musical ability as a skilled pianist [26] She also excelled in swimming and diving, and studied ballet and tap dance [29]\n\n\nPersonal life\nDiana first met Charles, Prince of Wales, the Queen's eldest son and heir apparent, when she was 16 in November 1977 He was then 29 and dating her older sister, Sarah [39] [40] Charles and Diana were guests at a country weekend during the summer of 1980 and he took a serious interest in her as a potential bride [41] The relationship progressed when he invited her aboard the royal yacht Britannia for a sailing weekend to Cowes This was followed by an invitation to Balmoral Castle (the royal family's Scottish residence) to meet his family [42] [43] She was well received by the Queen, the Queen Mother and the Duke of Edinburgh Charles subsequently courted Diana in London He proposed on 6 February 1981 at Windsor Castle, and she accepted, but their engagement was kept secret for two and a half weeks [38]\n\n\nEngagement and wedding\nTheir engagement became official on 24 February 1981 [21] Diana selected her own engagement ring [21] Following the engagement, she left her occupation as a nursery teacher's assistant and temporarily lived at the Queen Mother's residence, Clarence House [44] She subsequently resided at Buckingham Palace until the wedding, [44] where, according to the biographer Ingrid Seward, her life was \"incredibly lonely\" [45] Diana was the first Englishwoman to marry the first in line to the throne since Anne Hyde married James, Duke of York and Albany (later James VII and II), over 300 years earlier, and she was also the first royal bride to have a paying job before her engagement [21] [26] Diana's first public appearance with Charles was at a charity ball held at Goldsmiths' Hall in March 1981, where she was introduced to Princess Grace of Monaco [44]\n\n\nChildren\nThe couple had residences at Kensington Palace and Highgrove House, near Tetbury On 5 November 1981, Diana's pregnancy was announced [53] In January 1982—12 weeks into the pregnancy—Diana fell down a staircase at Sandringham, suffering some bruising, and the royal gynaecologist George Pinker was summoned from London; the foetus was uninjured [54] Diana later confessed that she had intentionally thrown herself down the stairs because she was feeling \"so inadequate\" [55] On 21 June 1982, she gave birth to the couple's first son, Prince William [56] She subsequently suffered from postpartum depression after her first pregnancy [57] Amidst some media criticism, she decided to take William—who was still a baby—on her first major tours of Australia and New Zealand, and the decision was popularly applauded By her own admission, Diana had not initially intended to take William until Malcolm Fraser, the Australian prime minister, made the suggestion [58]\n\n\nProblems and separation\nFive years into the marriage, the couple's incompatibility and age difference became visible and damaging [66] In 1986, Diana began a relationship with James Hewitt, the family's former riding instructor and in the same year, Charles resumed his relationship with his former girlfriend Camilla Parker Bowles The media speculated that Hewitt, not Charles, was Harry's father based on the alleged physical similarity between Hewitt and Harry, but Hewitt and others have denied this Harry was born two years before Hewitt and Diana began their affair [60] [67]\n\n\nDivorce\nThe journalist Martin Bashir interviewed Diana for the BBC current affairs show Panorama The interview was broadcast on 20 November 1995 [117] Diana discussed her own and her husband's extramarital affairs [118] Referring to Charles's relationship with Parker Bowles, she said: \"Well, there were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded.\" She also expressed doubt about her husband's suitability for kingship [117] The authors Tina Brown, Sally Bedell Smith, and Sarah Bradford support Diana's admission in the interview that she had suffered from depression, bulimia and had engaged numerous times in the act of self-harm; the show's transcript records Diana confirming many of her mental health problems [117] The combination of illnesses from which Diana herself said she suffered resulted in some of her biographers opining that she had borderline personality disorder [119] [120] It was later revealed that Bashir had used forged bank statements to win Diana and her brother's trust to secure the interview, falsely indicating people close to her had been paid for spying [121] Lord Dyson conducted an independent inquiry into the issue and concluded that Bashir had \"little difficulty in playing on  [Diana's] fears and paranoia\", a sentiment that was shared by Diana's son William [122] [123]\n\n\nPost-divorce\nAfter her divorce, Diana retained the double apartment on the north side of Kensington Palace that she had shared with Charles since the first year of their marriage; the apartment remained her home until her death the following year She also moved her offices to Kensington Palace but was permitted \"to use the state apartments at St James's Palace\" [128] [142] In a book published in 2003, Paul Burrell claimed Diana's private letters had revealed that her brother, Lord Spencer, had refused to allow her to live at Althorp, despite her request [130] The allegations were proven to be untrue as Spencer received legal apologies from different newspapers, including The Times in 2021, which admitted that \"having considered his sister's safety, and in line with police advice, the Earl offered the Princess of Wales a number of properties including Wormleighton Manor, the Spencer family's original ancestral home\" [143] However, he could not offer Garden House cottage on the Althorp estate to Diana as the home was intended for a member of staff [143]\n\n\nPrincess of Wales\nFollowing her engagement to Charles, Diana made her first official public appearance in March 1981 in a charity event at Goldsmiths' Hall [172] [173] She attended the Trooping the Colour for the first time in June 1981, making her appearance on the balcony of Buckingham Palace afterwards In October 1981, Charles and Diana visited Wales [26] [174] She attended the State Opening of Parliament for the first time on 4 November 1981 [175] Her first solo engagement was a visit to Regent Street on 18 November 1981 to switch on the Christmas lights [176] Diana made her inaugural overseas tour in September 1982, to attend the funeral of Princess Grace of Monaco [26] Also in 1982, Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands created Diana a Grand Cross of the Order of the Crown [177] In 1983, Diana accompanied Charles and William on a tour of Australia and New Zealand The tour was a success and the couple drew immense crowds, though the press focused more on Diana rather than Charles, coining the term 'Dianamania' as a reference to people's obsession with her [178] While sitting in a car with Charles near the Sydney Opera House, Diana burst into tears for a few minutes, which their office stated was due to jet lag and the heat [179] In New Zealand, the couple met with representatives of the Māori people [26] Their visit to Canada in June and July 1983 included a trip to Edmonton to open the 1983 Summer Universiade and a stop in Newfoundland to commemorate the 400th anniversary of that island's acquisition by the Crown [180] In 1983, she was targeted by the Scottish National Liberation Army who tried to deliver a letter bomb to her [181]\n\n\nCharity work and patronages\nIn 1983 Diana confided to the premier of Newfoundland, Brian Peckford, \"I am finding it very difficult to cope with the pressures of being Princess of Wales, but I am learning to cope with it\" [208] She was expected to make regular public appearances at hospitals, schools, and other facilities, in the 20th-century model of royal patronage From the mid-1980s, she became increasingly associated with numerous charities She carried out 191 official engagements in 1988 [209] and 397 in 1991 [210] Diana developed an intense interest in serious illnesses and health-related matters outside the purview of traditional royal involvement, including AIDS and leprosy In recognition of her effect as a philanthropist, Stephen Lee, director of the UK Institute of Charity Fundraising Managers, said \"Her overall effect on charity is probably more significant than any other person's in the 20th century.\" [211]\n\n\nHIV/AIDS\nDiana began her work with AIDS patients in the 1980s [236] Contrary to the prevailing stigmatization of AIDS patients, she was not averse to making physical contact with patients, [195] and was the first British royal to do so [236] In 1987, she held hands with an AIDS patient in one of her early efforts to destigmatise the condition [237] [238] Diana noted: \"HIV does not make people dangerous to know You can shake their hands and give them a hug Heaven knows they need it What's more, you can share their homes, their workplaces, and their playgrounds and toys\" [189] To Diana's disappointment, the Queen did not support this type of charity work, suggesting she get involved in \"something more pleasant\" [236] In July 1989, she opened Landmark Aids Centre in South London [239] [240] In October 1990, Diana opened Grandma's House, a home for young AIDS patients in Washington, DC [241] She was also a patron of the National AIDS Trust and regularly visited London Lighthouse, which provided residential care for HIV patients (it has since merged with the Terrence Higgins Trust) [189] [242] In 1991, she hugged one patient during a visit to the AIDS ward of the Middlesex Hospital, [189] which she had opened in 1987 as the first hospital unit dedicated to this cause in the UK [237] [243] As the patron of Turning Point, a health and social care organisation, Diana visited its project in London for people with HIV/AIDS in 1992 [244] She later established and led fundraising campaigns for AIDS research [21]\n\n\nLandmines\nDiana was patron of the HALO Trust, an organisation that removes debris—particularly landmines—left behind by war [249] [250] In January 1997, pictures of Diana touring an Angolan minefield in a ballistic helmet and flak jacket were seen worldwide [249] [250] During her campaign, she was accused of meddling in politics and called a \"loose cannon\" by Lord Howe, an official in the British Ministry of Defence [251] Despite the criticism, HALO states that Diana's efforts resulted in raising international awareness about landmines and the subsequent sufferings caused by them [249] [250] In June 1997, she gave a speech at a landmines conference held at the Royal Geographical Society, and went to Washington, DC to support the American Red Cross's anti-landmine initiative [26] From 7 to 10 August 1997, just days before her death, she visited Bosnia and Herzegovina with Jerry White and Ken Rutherford of the Landmine Survivors Network [26] [252] [253] [254]\n\n\nCancer\nFor her first solo official trip, Diana visited The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, a cancer treatment hospital in London [222] She later chose this charity to be among the organisations that benefited from the auction of her clothes in New York [222] The trust's communications manager said she did \"much to remove the stigma and taboo associated with diseases such as cancer, AIDS, HIV and leprosy\" [222] Diana became president of the hospital on 27 June 1989 [258] [259] [260] The Wolfson Children's Cancer Unit was opened by Diana on 25 February 1993 [258] In February 1996, Diana, who had been informed about a newly opened cancer hospital built by Imran Khan, travelled to Pakistan to visit its children's cancer wards and attend a fundraising dinner in aid of the charity in Lahore [261] She later visited the hospital again in May 1997 [262] In June 1996, she travelled to Chicago in her capacity as president of the Royal Marsden Hospital in order to attend a fundraising event at the Field Museum of Natural History and raised more than £1 million for cancer research [189] She additionally visited patients at the Cook County Hospital and delivered remarks at a conference on breast cancer at the Northwestern University Chicago campus after meeting a group of breast cancer researchers [263] In September 1996, after being asked by Katharine Graham, Diana went to Washington and appeared at a White House breakfast in respect of the Nina Hyde Center for Breast Cancer Research [264] She also attended an annual fund-raiser for breast cancer research organised by The Washington Post at the same centre [21] [265]\n\n\nOther areas\nIn November 1989, Diana visited a leprosy hospital in Indonesia [269] [236] Following her visit, she became patron of the Leprosy Mission, an organisation dedicated to providing medicine, treatment, and other support services to those who are afflicted with the disease She remained the patron of this charity [231] and visited several of its hospitals around the world, especially in India, Nepal, Zimbabwe and Nigeria until her death in 1997 [189] [270] She touched those affected by the disease when many people believed it could be contracted through casual contact [189] [269] \"It has always been my concern to touch people with leprosy, trying to show in a simple action that they are not reviled, nor are we repulsed\", she commented [270] The Diana Princess of Wales Health Education and Media Centre in Noida, India, was opened in her honour in November 1999, funded by the Diana Princess of Wales Memorial Fund to give social support to the people affected by leprosy and disability [270]\n\n\nPrivacy and legal issues\nIn November 1980, the Sunday Mirror ran a story claiming that Charles had used the Royal Train twice for secret love rendezvous with Diana, prompting the palace to issue a statement, calling the story \"a total fabrication\" and demanding an apology [277] [278] The newspaper editors, however, insisted that the woman boarding the train was Diana and declined to apologise [277] In February 1982, pictures of a pregnant Diana in bikini while holidaying were published in the media The Queen subsequently released a statement and called it \"the blackest day in the history of British journalism.\" [279]\n\n\nDeath\nDiana died on 31 August 1997 in a car crash in the Pont de l'Alma tunnel in Paris while her driver was fleeing the paparazzi [286] The crash also resulted in the deaths of her companion Dodi Fayed and their driver, Henri Paul, who was also the acting security manager of Hôtel Ritz Paris Trevor Rees-Jones, who was employed as a bodyguard by Dodi's father, [287] survived the crash, suffering a serious head injury The televised funeral, on 6 September, was watched by a British television audience that peaked at 32.1 million, which was one of the United Kingdom's highest viewing figures ever and a United States television audience that peaked at 50 million [288] [289] The event was broadcast to over 200 countries and was seen by an estimated 2.5 billion people [290] [291]\n\n\nTribute, funeral, and burial\nThe sudden and unexpected death of an extraordinarily popular royal figure brought statements from senior figures worldwide and many tributes by members of the public [292] [293] [294] People left flowers, candles, cards, and personal messages outside Kensington Palace for many months Diana's coffin, draped with the royal flag, was brought to London from Paris by Charles and her two sisters on 31 August 1997 [295] [296] The coffin was taken to a private mortuary and then placed in the Chapel Royal, St James's Palace [295]\n\n\nConspiracy theories, inquest and verdict\nThe initial French judicial investigation concluded that the crash was caused by Paul's intoxication, reckless driving, speeding, and effects of prescription drugs [304] In February 1998, Mohamed Al-Fayed, father of Dodi Fayed, publicly said the crash, which killed his son, had been planned, [305] and accused MI6 and the Duke of Edinburgh [306] An inquest, which started in London in 2004 and continued in 2007 and 2008, [307] attributed the crash to grossly negligent driving by Paul and to the pursuing paparazzi, who forced Paul to speed into the tunnel [308] On 7 April 2008, the jury returned a verdict of \"unlawful killing\" On the day after the final verdict of the inquest, Al-Fayed announced that he would end his 10-year campaign to establish that the tragedy was murder; he said he did so for the sake of Diana's children [309]\n\n\nLater events\nFollowing her death, Diana left a £21 million estate, \"netting £17 million after estate taxes\", which were left in the hands of trustees, her mother, and her sister Sarah [310] [311] The will was signed in June 1993, but Diana had it modified in February 1996 to remove the name of her personal secretary from the list of trustees and have Sarah replace him [312] After applying personal and inheritance taxes, a net estate of £12.9 million was left to be distributed among the beneficiaries [313] Her two sons subsequently inherited the majority of her estate Each of them was left with £6.5 million which was invested and gathered substantial interest, and an estimated £10 million was given to each son upon turning 30 years old in 2012 and 2014 respectively [314] [315] Many of Diana's possessions were initially left in the care of her brother, who put them on show in Althorp twice a year until they were returned to Diana's sons [314] [310] They were also put on display in American museums and as of 2011 [update] raised two million dollars for charities [310] Among the objects were her dresses and suits along with numerous family paintings and jewels [314] Diana's engagement ring and her yellow gold watch were given to William and Harry, respectively William later passed the ring to his wife, Catherine Middleton Her wedding dress was also given to her sons [314] [316] [317]\n\n\nFinances\nFollowing her death, Diana left a £21 million estate, \"netting £17 million after estate taxes\", which were left in the hands of trustees, her mother, and her sister Sarah [310] [311] The will was signed in June 1993, but Diana had it modified in February 1996 to remove the name of her personal secretary from the list of trustees and have Sarah replace him [312] After applying personal and inheritance taxes, a net estate of £12.9 million was left to be distributed among the beneficiaries [313] Her two sons

Catherine Middleton Her wedding dress was also given to her sons [314] [316] [317]\n\n\nSubject of US government surveillance\nIn 1999, after the submission of a Freedom of Information request by the Internet news service apbonline.com, it was revealed that Diana had been placed under surveillance by the National Security Agency until her death, and the organisation kept a top secret file on her containing more than 1,000 pages [318] [319] The contents of Diana's NSA file cannot be disclosed because of national security concerns [318] The NSA officials insisted Diana was not a \"target of  [their] massive, worldwide electronic eavesdropping infrastructure.\" [318] Despite multiple inquiries for the files to be declassified—with one of the notable ones being filed by Mohamed Al-Fayed—the NSA has refused to release the documents [319]\n\n\nAnniversaries, commemorations, and auctions\nOn the first anniversary of Diana's death, people left flowers and bouquets outside the gates of Kensington Palace and a memorial service was held at Westminster Abbey [321] [322] The royal family and Tony Blair and his family went to Crathie Kirk for private prayers, while Diana's family held a private memorial service at Althorp [323] [324] All flags at Buckingham Palace and other royal residences were flown at half-mast on the Queen's orders [325] The Union Jack was first lowered to half-mast on the day of Diana's funeral and has set a precedent, as based on the previous protocol no flag could ever fly at half-mast over the palace \"even on the death of a monarch\" [325] Since 1997, however, the Union Flag (but not the Royal Standard) has flown at half-mast upon the deaths of members of the royal family, and other times of national mourning [326]\n\n\nLegacy\nDiana remains one of the most popular members of the royal family throughout history, and she continues to influence the younger generations of royals [343] [344] [345] She was a major presence on the world stage from her engagement to Charles until her death, and was often described as the \"world's most photographed woman\" [21] [346] She was noted for her compassion, style, charisma, and high-profile charity work, as well as her ill-fated marriage [347] [211] [348] Biographer Sarah Bradford commented, \"The only cure for her suffering would have been the love of the Prince of Wales .. the way in which he consistently denigrated her reduced her to despair.\" [99] Despite all the marital issues and scandals, Diana continued to enjoy a high level of popularity in the polls while her husband was suffering from low levels of public approval [21] Diana's former private secretary Patrick Jephson described her as an organised and hardworking person, and pointed out Charles was not able to \"reconcile with his wife's extraordinary popularity\", [349] a viewpoint supported by the biographer Tina Brown [350] He also said she was a tough boss who was \"equally quick to appreciate hard work\" but could also be defiant \"if she felt she had been the victim of injustice\" [349] Diana's mother also defined her as a \"loving\" figure who could occasionally be \"tempestuous\" [162] She was often described as a devoted mother to her children, [21] [351] who are believed to be influenced by her personality and way of life [352]\n\n\nPublic image\nDiana remains one of the most popular

around the world In 2012, Time included Diana on its All-Time 100 Fashion Icons list [376] Iain Hollingshead of The Telegraph wrote: \" [Diana] had an ability to sell clothes just by looking at them.\" [377] [378] An early example of the effect occurred during her courtship with Charles in 1980 when sales of Hunter Wellington boots skyrocketed after she was pictured wearing a pair on the Balmoral estate [377] [379] According to designers and people who worked with Diana, she used fashion and style to endorse her charitable causes, express herself and communicate [380] [381] [382] Diana remains a prominent figure for her fashion style, impacting recent cultural and style trends [383] [384] [336] [385]\n\n\nMemorials\nPermanent memorials to Diana include the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain in Hyde Park, London; [404] the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Playground in Kensington Gardens; [405] the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Walk, a circular path between

of Wales, in the Sunken Garden of Kensington Palace; [408] and the Princess Diana Memorial in the garden of Schloss Cobenzl in Vienna, making it the first memorial dedicated to Diana in a German-speaking country [409] The Flame of Liberty was erected in 1989 on the Place de l'Alma in Paris above the entrance to the tunnel in which the fatal crash later occurred It became an unofficial memorial to Diana [410] [411] The Place de l'Alma was renamed Place Diana princesse de Galles in 2019 [412] Following her death, several countries issued postage stamps commemorating Diana, including Armenia, Azerbaijan, Somalia, and Congo [413] [414] [415] A bronze plaque was unveiled by Earl Spencer at Northampton Guildhall in 2002 as a memorial to his sister [416]\n\n\nIn popular culture and art\nBefore and after her death, Diana has been the subject of films and television series and depicted in contemporary art The first biopics about Diana and Charles were Charles & Diana: A Royal Love Story and The Royal Romance of Charles and Diana that were broadcast on American TV channels on 17 and 20 September 1981, respectively [423] In December 1992, ABC aired Charles and Diana: Unhappily

of Wales\n\nDiana, Princess of Wales, was a member of the British royal family and a philanthropist. She was the first wife of Charles, Prince of Wales, and the mother of Prince William and Prince Harry. Diana was known for her charity work, fashion sense, and ability to connect with people from all walks of life.\n\n## Early Life\n\nDiana Frances Spencer was born on July 1, 1961, at Park House, Sandringham, Norfolk, England. She was the fourth of five children to John Spencer, Viscount Althorp, and Frances Spencer, Viscountess Althorp. Diana's family had been closely allied with the British royal family for several generations, and her parents were hoping for a boy to carry on the family line. Diana's name was chosen after her mother and Lady Diana Spencer, a many-times-great-aunt who was also a prospective Princess of Wales.\n\n## Education and Career\n\nDiana was initially home-schooled under the supervision of her governess, Gertrude Allen. She began her formal education at Silfield Private School in King's Lynn, Norfolk, and moved to Riddlesworth Hall School, an all-girls boarding school near Thetford, when she was nine. Diana joined her sisters at West Heath Girls' School in Sevenoaks, Kent, in 1973. She did not perform well academically, failing her O-levels twice, but was recognized for her community spirit.\n\n## Personal Life\n\nDiana first met Charles, Prince of Wales, when she was 16 in November 1977. Charles was then 29 and dating her older sister, Sarah. The couple's relationship progressed when Charles invited Diana aboard the royal yacht Britannia for a sailing weekend to Cowes. Diana became engaged to Charles in February 1981 and the couple married on July 29, 1981, at St Paul's Cathedral.\n\n## Engagement and Wedding\n\nDiana's engagement to Charles was announced on February 24, 1981, and she selected her own engagement ring. Following the engagement, Diana left her occupation as a nursery teacher's assistant and temporarily lived at the Queen Mother's residence, Clarence House. Diana's first public appearance with Charles was at a charity ball held at Goldsmiths' Hall in March 1981.\n\n## Children\n\nDiana's first pregnancy was announced in November 1981, and she gave birth to a son, Prince William, on June 21, 1982. The couple's second child, Prince Harry, was born on September 15, 1984.

\"Diana,_Princess_of_Wales\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nDiana Frances Spencer was born on 1 July 1961, the fourth of five children of John Spencer, Viscount Althorp (1924–1992), and Frances Spencer, Viscountess Althorp (née Roche; 1936–2004) [2] She was delivered at Park House, Sandringham, Norfolk [3] The Spencer family had been closely allied with the British royal family for several generations; [4] her grandmothers, Cynthia Spencer, Countess Spencer, and Ruth Roche, Baroness Fermoy, had served as ladies-in-waiting to Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother [5] Her parents were hoping for a boy to carry on the family line, and no name was chosen for a week until they settled on Diana Frances after her mother and Lady Diana Spencer, a many-times-great-aunt who was also a prospective Princess of Wales as a potential bride for Frederick, Prince of Wales [6] Within the family, she was also known informally as \"Duch\", a reference to her duchess-like attitude in childhood [7]\n\n\nEducation and career\nDiana was initially home-schooled under the supervision of her governess, Gertrude Allen [21] She began her formal education at Silfield Private School in King's Lynn, Norfolk, and moved to Riddlesworth Hall School, an all-girls boarding school near Thetford, when she was nine [22] She joined her sisters at West Heath Girls' School in Sevenoaks, Kent, in 1973 [23] She did not perform well academically, failing her O-levels twice [24] [25] Her outstanding community spirit was recognised with an award from West Heath [26] She left West Heath when she was sixteen [27] Her brother Charles recalls her as being quite shy up until that time [28] She demonstrated musical ability as a skilled pianist [26] She also excelled in swimming and diving, and studied ballet and tap dance [29]\n\n\nPersonal life\nDiana first met Charles, Prince of Wales, the Queen's eldest son and heir apparent, when she was 16 in November 1977 He was then 29 and dating her older sister, Sarah [39] [40] Charles and Diana were guests at a country weekend during the summer of 1980 and he took a serious interest in her as a potential bride [41] The relationship progressed when he invited her aboard the royal yacht Britannia for a sailing weekend to Cowes This was followed by an invitation to Balmoral Castle (the royal family's Scottish residence) to meet his family [42] [43] She was well received by the Queen, the Queen Mother and the Duke of Edinburgh Charles subsequently courted Diana in London He proposed on 6 February 1981 at Windsor Castle, and she accepted, but their engagement was kept secret for two and a half weeks [38]\n\n\nEngagement and wedding\nTheir engagement became official on 24 February 1981 [21] Diana selected her own engagement ring [21] Following the engagement, she left her occupation as a nursery teacher's assistant and temporarily lived at the Queen Mother's residence, Clarence House [44] She subsequently resided at Buckingham Palace until the wedding, [44] where, according to the biographer Ingrid Seward, her life was \"incredibly lonely\" [45] Diana was the first Englishwoman to marry the first in line to the throne since Anne Hyde married James, Duke of York and Albany (later James VII and II), over 300 years earlier, and she was also the first royal bride to have a paying job before her engagement [21] [26] Diana's first public appearance with Charles was at a charity ball held at Goldsmiths' Hall in March 1981, where she was introduced to Princess Grace of Monaco [44]\n\n\nChildren\nThe couple had residences at Kensington Palace and Highgrove House, near Tetbury On 5 November 1981, Diana's pregnancy was announced [53] In January 1982—12 weeks into the pregnancy—Diana fell down a staircase at Sandringham, suffering some bruising, and the royal gynaecologist George Pinker was summoned from London; the foetus was uninjured [54] Diana later confessed that she had intentionally thrown herself down the stairs because she was feeling \"so inadequate\" [55] On 21 June 1982, she gave birth to the couple's first son, Prince William [56] She subsequently suffered from postpartum depression after her first pregnancy [57] Amidst some media criticism, she decided to take William—who was still a baby—on her first major tours of Australia and New Zealand, and the decision was popularly applauded By her own admission, Diana had not initially intended to take William until Malcolm Fraser, the Australian prime minister, made the suggestion [58]\n\n\nProblems and separation\nFive years into the marriage, the couple's incompatibility and age difference became visible and damaging [66] In 1986, Diana began a relationship with James Hewitt, the family's former riding instructor and in the same year, Charles resumed his relationship with his former girlfriend Camilla Parker Bowles The media speculated that Hewitt, not Charles, was Harry's father based on the alleged physical similarity between Hewitt and Harry, but Hewitt and others have denied this Harry was born two years before Hewitt and Diana began their affair [60] [67]\n\n\nDivorce\nThe journalist Martin Bashir interviewed Diana for the BBC current affairs show Panorama The interview was broadcast on 20 November 1995 [117] Diana discussed her own and her husband's extramarital affairs [118] Referring to Charles's relationship with Parker Bowles, she said: \"Well, there were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded.\" She also expressed doubt about her husband's suitability for kingship [117] The authors Tina Brown, Sally Bedell Smith, and Sarah Bradford support Diana's admission in the interview that she had suffered from depression, bulimia and had engaged numerous times in the act of self-harm; the show's transcript records Diana confirming many of her mental health problems [117] The combination of illnesses from which Diana herself said she suffered resulted in some of her biographers opining that she had borderline personality disorder [119] [120] It was later revealed that Bashir had used forged bank statements to win Diana and her brother's trust to secure the interview, falsely indicating people close to her had been paid for spying [121] Lord Dyson conducted an independent inquiry into the issue and concluded that Bashir had \"little difficulty in playing on  [Diana's] fears and paranoia\", a sentiment that was shared by Diana's son William [122] [123]\n\n\nPost-divorce\nAfter her divorce, Diana retained the double apartment on the north side of Kensington Palace that she had shared with Charles since the first year of their marriage; the apartment remained her home until her death the following year She also moved her offices to Kensington Palace but was permitted \"to use the state apartments at St James's Palace\" [128] [142] In a book published in 2003, Paul Burrell claimed Diana's private letters had revealed that her brother, Lord Spencer, had refused to allow her to live at Althorp, despite her request [130] The allegations were proven to be untrue as Spencer received legal apologies from different newspapers, including The Times in 2021, which admitted that \"having considered his sister's safety, and in line with police advice, the Earl offered the Princess of Wales a number of properties including Wormleighton Manor, the Spencer family's original ancestral home\" [143] However, he could not offer Garden House cottage on the Althorp estate to Diana as the home was intended for a member of staff [143]\n\n\nPrincess of Wales\nFollowing her engagement to Charles, Diana made her first official public appearance in March 1981 in a charity event at Goldsmiths' Hall [172] [173] She attended the Trooping the Colour for the first time in June 1981, making her appearance on the balcony of Buckingham Palace afterwards In October 1981, Charles and Diana visited Wales [26] [174] She attended the State Opening of Parliament for the first time on 4 November 1981 [175] Her first solo engagement was a visit to Regent Street on 18 November 1981 to switch on the Christmas lights [176] Diana made her inaugural overseas tour in September 1982, to attend the funeral of Princess Grace of Monaco [26] Also in 1982, Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands created Diana a Grand Cross of the Order of the Crown [177] In 1983, Diana accompanied Charles and William on a tour of Australia and New Zealand The tour was a success and the couple drew immense crowds, though the press focused more on Diana rather than Charles, coining the term 'Dianamania' as a reference to people's obsession with her [178] While sitting in a car with Charles near the Sydney Opera House, Diana burst into tears for a few minutes, which their office stated was due to jet lag and the heat [179] In New Zealand, the couple met with representatives of the Māori people [26] Their visit to Canada in June and July 1983 included a trip to Edmonton to open the 1983 Summer Universiade and a stop in Newfoundland to commemorate the 400th anniversary of that island's acquisition by the Crown [180] In 1983, she was targeted by the Scottish National Liberation Army who tried to deliver a letter bomb to her [181]\n\n\nCharity work and patronages\nIn 1983 Diana confided to the premier of Newfoundland, Brian Peckford, \"I am finding it very difficult to cope with the pressures of being Princess of Wales, but I am learning to cope with it\" [208] She was expected to make regular public appearances at hospitals, schools, and other facilities, in the 20th-century model of royal patronage From the mid-1980s, she became increasingly associated with numerous charities She carried out 191 official engagements in 1988 [209] and 397 in 1991 [210] Diana developed an intense interest in serious illnesses and health-related matters outside the purview of traditional royal involvement, including AIDS and leprosy In recognition of her effect as a philanthropist, Stephen Lee, director of the UK Institute of Charity Fundraising Managers, said \"Her overall effect on charity is probably more significant than any other person's in the 20th century.\" [211]\n\n\nHIV/AIDS\nDiana began her work with AIDS patients in the 1980s [236] Contrary to the prevailing stigmatization of AIDS patients, she was not averse to making physical contact with patients, [195] and was the first British royal to do so [236] In 1987, she held hands with an AIDS patient in one of her early efforts to destigmatise the condition [237] [238] Diana noted: \"HIV does not make people dangerous to know You can shake their hands and give them a hug Heaven knows they need it What's more, you can share their homes, their workplaces, and their playgrounds and toys\" [189] To Diana's disappointment, the Queen did not support this type of charity work, suggesting she get involved in \"something more pleasant\" [236] In July 1989, she opened Landmark Aids Centre in South London [239] [240] In October 1990, Diana opened Grandma's House, a home for young AIDS patients in Washington, DC [241] She was also a patron of the National AIDS Trust and regularly visited London Lighthouse, which provided residential care for HIV patients (it has since merged with the Terrence Higgins Trust) [189] [242] In 1991, she hugged one patient during a visit to the AIDS ward of the Middlesex Hospital, [189] which she had opened in 1987 as the first hospital unit dedicated to this cause in the UK [237] [243] As the patron of Turning Point, a health and social care organisation, Diana visited its project in London for people with HIV/AIDS in 1992 [244] She later established and led fundraising campaigns for AIDS research [21]\n\n\nLandmines\nDiana was patron of the HALO Trust, an organisation that removes debris—particularly landmines—left behind by war [249] [250] In January 1997, pictures of Diana touring an Angolan minefield in a ballistic helmet and flak jacket were seen worldwide [249] [250] During her campaign, she was accused of meddling in politics and called a \"loose cannon\" by Lord Howe, an official in the British Ministry of Defence [251] Despite the criticism, HALO states that Diana's efforts resulted in raising international awareness about landmines and the subsequent sufferings caused by them [249] [250] In June 1997, she gave a speech at a landmines conference held at the Royal Geographical Society, and went to Washington, DC to support the American Red Cross's anti-landmine initiative [26] From 7 to 10 August 1997, just days before her death, she visited Bosnia and Herzegovina with Jerry White and Ken Rutherford of the Landmine Survivors Network [26] [252] [253] [254]\n\n\nCancer\nFor her first solo official trip, Diana visited The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, a cancer treatment hospital in London [222] She later chose this charity to be among the organisations that benefited from the auction of her clothes in New York [222] The trust's communications manager said she did \"much to remove the stigma and taboo associated with diseases such as cancer, AIDS, HIV and leprosy\" [222] Diana became president of the hospital on 27 June 1989 [258] [259] [260] The Wolfson Children's Cancer Unit was opened by Diana on 25 February 1993 [258] In February 1996, Diana, who had been informed about a newly opened cancer hospital built by Imran Khan, travelled to Pakistan to visit its children's cancer wards and attend a fundraising dinner in aid of the charity in Lahore [261] She later visited the hospital again in May 1997 [262] In June 1996, she travelled to Chicago in her capacity as president of the Royal Marsden Hospital in order to attend a fundraising event at the Field Museum of Natural History and raised more than £1 million for cancer research [189] She additionally visited patients at the Cook County Hospital and delivered remarks at a conference on breast cancer at the Northwestern University Chicago campus after meeting a group of breast cancer researchers [263] In September 1996, after being asked by Katharine Graham, Diana went to Washington and appeared at a White House breakfast in respect of the Nina Hyde Center for Breast Cancer Research [264] She also attended an annual fund-raiser for breast cancer research organised by The Washington Post at the same centre [21] [265]\n\n\nOther areas\nIn November 1989, Diana visited a leprosy hospital in Indonesia [269] [236] Following her visit, she became patron of the Leprosy Mission, an organisation dedicated to providing medicine, treatment, and other support services to those who are afflicted with the disease She remained the patron of this charity [231] and visited several of its hospitals around the world, especially in India, Nepal, Zimbabwe and Nigeria until her death in 1997 [189] [270] She touched those affected by the disease when many people believed it could be contracted through casual contact [189] [269] \"It has always been my concern to touch people with leprosy, trying to show in a simple action that they are not reviled, nor are we repulsed\", she commented [270] The Diana Princess of Wales Health Education and Media Centre in Noida, India, was opened in her honour in November 1999, funded by the Diana Princess of Wales Memorial Fund to give social support to the people affected by leprosy and disability [270]\n\n\nPrivacy and legal issues\nIn November 1980, the Sunday Mirror ran a story claiming that Charles had used the Royal Train twice for secret love rendezvous with Diana, prompting the palace to issue a statement, calling the story \"a total fabrication\" and demanding an apology [277] [278] The newspaper editors, however, insisted that the woman boarding the train was Diana and declined to apologise [277] In February 1982, pictures of a pregnant Diana in bikini while holidaying were published in the media The Queen subsequently released a statement and called it \"the blackest day in the history of British journalism.\" [279]\n\n\nDeath\nDiana died on 31 August 1997 in a car crash in the Pont de l'Alma tunnel in Paris while her driver was fleeing the paparazzi [286] The crash also resulted in the deaths of her companion Dodi Fayed and their driver, Henri Paul, who was also the acting security manager of Hôtel Ritz Paris Trevor Rees-Jones, who was employed as a bodyguard by Dodi's father, [287] survived the crash, suffering a serious head injury The televised funeral, on 6 September, was watched by a British television audience that peaked at 32.1 million, which was one of the United Kingdom's highest viewing figures ever and a United States television audience that peaked at 50 million [288] [289] The event was broadcast to over 200 countries and was seen by an estimated 2.5 billion people [290] [291]\n\n\nTribute, funeral, and burial\nThe sudden and unexpected death of an extraordinarily popular royal figure brought statements from senior figures worldwide and many tributes by members of the public [292] [293] [294] People left flowers, candles, cards, and personal messages outside Kensington Palace for many months Diana's coffin, draped with the royal flag, was brought to London from Paris by Charles and her two sisters on 31 August 1997 [295] [296] The coffin was taken to a private mortuary and then placed in the Chapel Royal, St James's Palace [295]\n\n\nConspiracy theories, inquest and verdict\nThe initial French judicial investigation concluded that the crash was caused by Paul's intoxication, reckless driving, speeding, and effects of prescription drugs [304] In February 1998, Mohamed Al-Fayed, father of Dodi Fayed, publicly said the crash, which killed his son, had been planned, [305] and accused MI6 and the Duke of Edinburgh [306] An inquest, which started in London in 2004 and continued in 2007 and 2008, [307] attributed the crash to grossly negligent driving by Paul and to the pursuing paparazzi, who forced Paul to speed into the tunnel [308] On 7 April 2008, the jury returned a verdict of \"unlawful killing\" On the day after the final verdict of the inquest, Al-Fayed announced that he would end his 10-year campaign to establish that the tragedy was murder; he said he did so for the sake of Diana's children [309]\n\n\nLater events\nFollowing her death, Diana left a £21 million estate, \"netting £17 million after estate taxes\", which were left in the hands of trustees, her mother, and her sister Sarah [310] [311] The will was signed in June 1993, but Diana had it modified in February 1996 to remove the name of her personal secretary from the list of trustees and have Sarah replace him [312] After applying personal and inheritance taxes, a net estate of £12.9 million was left to be distributed among the beneficiaries [313] Her two sons subsequently inherited the majority of her estate Each of them was left with £6.5 million which was invested and gathered substantial interest, and an estimated £10 million was given to each son upon turning 30 years old in 2012 and 2014 respectively [314] [315] Many of Diana's possessions were initially left in the care of her brother, who put them on show in Althorp twice a year until they were returned to Diana's sons [314] [310] They were also put on display in American museums and as of 2011 [update] raised two million dollars for charities [310] Among the objects were her dresses and suits along with numerous family paintings and jewels [314] Diana's engagement ring and her yellow gold watch were given to William and Harry, respectively William later passed the ring to his wife, Catherine Middleton Her wedding dress was also given to her sons [314] [316] [317]\n\n\nFinances\nFollowing her death, Diana left a £21 million estate, \"netting £17 million after estate taxes\", which were left in the hands of trustees, her mother, and her sister Sarah [310] [311] The will was signed in June 1993, but Diana had it modified in February 1996 to remove the name of her personal secretary from the list of trustees and have Sarah replace him [312] After applying personal and inheritance taxes, a net estate of £12.9 million was left to be distributed among the beneficiaries [313] Her two sons subsequently inherited the majority of her estate Each of them was left with £6.5 million which was invested and gathered substantial interest, and an estimated £10 million was given to each son upon turning 30 years old in 2012 and 2014 respectively [314] [315] Many of Diana's possessions were initially left in the care of her brother, who put them on show in Althorp twice a year until they were

suits along with numerous family paintings and jewels [314] Diana's engagement ring and her yellow gold watch were given to William and Harry, respectively William later passed the ring to his wife, Catherine Middleton Her wedding dress was also given to her sons [314] [316] [317]\n\n\nSubject of US government surveillance\nIn 1999, after the submission of a Freedom of Information request by the Internet news service apbonline.com, it was revealed that Diana had been placed under surveillance by the National Security Agency until her death, and the organisation kept a top secret file on her containing more than 1,000 pages [318] [319] The contents of Diana's NSA file cannot be disclosed because of national security concerns [318] The NSA officials insisted Diana was not a \"target of  [their] massive, worldwide electronic eavesdropping infrastructure.\" [318] Despite multiple inquiries for the files to be declassified—with one of the notable ones being filed by Mohamed Al-Fayed—the NSA has refused to release the documents [319]\n\n\nAnniversaries, commemorations, and auctions\nOn the first anniversary of Diana's death, people left flowers and bouquets outside the gates of Kensington Palace and a memorial service was held at Westminster Abbey [321] [322] The royal family and Tony Blair and his family went to Crathie Kirk for private prayers, while Diana's family held a private memorial service at Althorp [323] [324] All flags at Buckingham Palace and other royal residences were flown at half-mast on the Queen's orders [325] The Union Jack was first lowered to half-mast on the day of Diana's funeral and has set a precedent, as based on the previous protocol no flag could ever fly at half-mast over the palace \"even on the death of a monarch\" [325] Since 1997, however, the Union Flag (but not the Royal Standard) has flown at half-mast upon the deaths of members of the royal family, and other times of national mourning [326]\n\n\nLegacy\nDiana remains one of the most popular members of the royal family throughout history, and she continues to influence the younger generations of royals [343] [344] [345] She was a major presence on the world stage from her engagement to Charles until her death, and was often described as the \"world's most photographed woman\" [21] [346] She was noted for her compassion, style, charisma, and high-profile charity work, as well as her ill-fated marriage [347] [211] [348] Biographer Sarah Bradford commented, \"The only cure for her suffering would have been the love of the Prince of Wales .. the way in which he consistently denigrated her reduced her to despair.\" [99] Despite all the marital issues and scandals, Diana continued to enjoy a high level of popularity in the polls while her husband was suffering from low levels of public approval [21] Diana's former private secretary Patrick Jephson described her as an organised and hardworking person, and pointed out Charles was not able to \"reconcile with his wife's extraordinary popularity\", [349] a viewpoint supported by the biographer Tina Brown [350] He also said she was a tough boss who was \"equally quick to appreciate hard work\" but could also be defiant \"if she felt she had been the victim of injustice\" [349] Diana's mother also defined her as a \"loving\" figure who could occasionally be \"tempestuous\" [162] She was often described as a devoted mother to her children, [21] [351] who are believed to be influenced by her personality and way of life [352]\n\n\nPublic image\nDiana remains one of the most popular

around the world In 2012, Time included Diana on its All-Time 100 Fashion Icons list [376] Iain Hollingshead of The Telegraph wrote: \" [Diana] had an ability to sell clothes just by looking at them.\" [377] [378] An early example of the effect occurred during her courtship with Charles in 1980 when sales of Hunter Wellington boots skyrocketed after she was pictured wearing a pair on the Balmoral estate [377] [379] According to designers and people who worked with Diana, she used fashion and style to endorse her charitable causes, express herself and communicate [380] [381] [382] Diana remains a prominent figure for her fashion style, impacting recent cultural and style trends [383] [384] [336] [385]\n\n\nMemorials\nPermanent memorials to Diana include the Diana, Princess of

of Wales, in the Sunken Garden of Kensington Palace; [408] and the Princess Diana Memorial in the garden of Schloss Cobenzl in Vienna, making it the first memorial dedicated to Diana in a German-speaking country [409] The Flame of Liberty was erected in 1989 on the Place de l'Alma in Paris above the entrance to the tunnel in which the fatal crash later occurred It became an unofficial memorial to Diana [410] [411] The Place de l'Alma was renamed Place Diana princesse de Galles in 2019 [412] Following her death, several countries issued postage stamps commemorating Diana, including Armenia, Azerbaijan, Somalia, and Congo [413] [414] [415] A bronze plaque was unveiled by Earl Spencer at Northampton Guildhall in 2002 as a memorial to his sister [416]\n\n\nIn popular culture and art\nBefore and after her death, Diana has been the subject of films and television series and depicted in contemporary art The first biopics about Diana and Charles were Charles & Diana: A Royal Love Story and The Royal Romance of Charles and Diana that were broadcast on American TV channels on 17 and 20 September 1981, respectively [423] In December 1992, ABC aired Charles and Diana: Unhappily

serve at least 25 years before being eligible for parole [87]\nThe punishment for the crime of first-degree murder in California is upgraded to a minimum of life imprisonment without the possibility

intent or premeditation This is called felony murder This offense is categorized as capital offense, so if convicted, the offender could possibly receive the death penalty [93] [94]

imprisonment or the death penalty [100]\n\n\nMichigan\nIn Michigan, a person is found guilty of first-degree murder when murder is perpetrated by means of poison, lying in wait, or any other willful,

unlawfully selling, giving away, bartering, delivering, exchanging, distributing, or administering a controlled substance classified in Schedule I or II\") was added to the definition of third-degree

first-degree murder (\"criminal homicide .. committed by an intentional killing\") nor a second-degree murder (\"committed while defendant was engaged as a principal or an accomplice in the perpetration of a felony\") For purposes of that section, \"felony\" is specifically defined as \"engaging in or being an accomplice in the commission of, or an attempt to commit, or flight after committing, or attempting to commit robbery, rape, or deviate sexual intercourse by force or threat of force, arson, burglary or kidnapping.\" [111] There are also parallel crimes of first-degree, second-degree, and third-degree murder of an unborn child [112] There does not exist the crime of third-degree murder of a law-enforcement officer, only first-degree and second-degree Third-degree murder and third-degree murder of an unborn child are punishable by a maximum of 40 years' imprisonment [113]\n\n\nWisconsin\nSoon after statehood, Wisconsin enacted statutes repealing the common law crime of murder, creating the statutory crime of murder and dividing the statutory crime of murder into three degrees, with the third encompassing felony murder For example, the 1849 Revised Statutes defined third-degree murder as a killing \"perpetrated without any design to effect the death, by a person engaged in the commission of any felony\" [119] The 1956 Criminal Code in § 940.03 defined third-degree murder as causing the death of another \"in the course of committing or attempting to commit a felony .. as a natural and probable consequence of the commission of or attempt to commit the felony\", and provided that the sentence for the underlying felony could thus be extended by 15 years This was described by some commentators as a \"hybrid\" between the common-law felony murder rule and the civil law approach of treating an unintentional death as a \"penalty-enhancer\" to the punishment for the underlying felony [120] The 1988 revision of § 940.03 removed the term \"third-degree murder\" entirely and re-entitled the section as \"felony murder\" [121]\n\n\nWashington\nIn the state of Washington, a person may be convicted of first-degree murder when there is a

definition and classification vary from state to state. In this article, we will explore the jurisdiction of murder, the different degrees of murder, and the specific laws and penalties for each state.\n\n**Jurisdiction**\n\nIn the United States, the jurisdiction of murder is determined by the state in which the crime is committed. If a murder is committed within the borders of a state, that state has jurisdiction, and in a similar way, if the crime is committed in the District of Columbia, the D.C. Superior Court retains jurisdiction.

This subcategory is typically reserved for cases where there is no premeditation or intent to kill, but the death is still a result of reckless or negligent behavior.\n\n**Fetal Killing**\n\nUnder the common law, an assault on a pregnant woman resulting in a stillbirth was not considered murder. Remedies were limited to criminal penalties for the assault on the mother and tort action for loss of the anticipated economic services of the lost child, for emotional pain and suffering, or both.

These laws differ about the stage of development at which the fetus is protected. For example, some states protect the fetus from the moment of conception, while others only protect it from a certain point in gestation.\n\n**Sentencing Guidelines**\n\nIn Arizona, a person is charged with murder when the offender knowingly and intentionally causes the death of a person or unborn child.

A first-degree murder involves one or more specific elements, including premeditation, deliberation, or extreme indifference to human life.\n\n**Louisiana**\n\nLouisiana states homicide in the third-degree is manslaughter. There are other specific guidelines, for example, the killing of a police officer or firefighter is an automatic first-degree charge, and intent to kill more than one person is automatically a first-degree charge.

The custom was particularly prevalent in schools during the 19th and early 20th centuries, where speaking Welsh was seen as a hindrance to the learning of English and the promotion of British culture. As a result, children who spoke Welsh were often subjected to punishment, ridicule, and isolation, leading to a silencing of the Welsh language and culture.\n\nThe effects of Welsh Not were far-reaching and damaging, leading to a decline in the use of Welsh as a spoken language. As noted by a contemporary observer, \"Among other injurious effects, this custom has been found to lead children to visit stealthily the houses of their school-fellows for the purpose of detecting those who speak Welsh to their parents, and transferring to them the punishment due to themselves.\" This practice not only suppressed the use of Welsh but also created a culture of fear and mistrust among children.\n\n## Background\n\nThe use of Welsh Not was closely tied to the broader cultural and linguistic context of Wales during the 19th and early 20th centuries. As the Industrial Revolution took hold, the Welsh language was seen as a barrier to economic development and modernization. Many Welsh-speaking communities were concentrated in rural areas, and the language was associated with traditional farming and craftsmanship. The introduction of English as a dominant language in schools and government institutions further solidified the position of English as the language of power and authority.\n\nIn this context, the promotion of English as a language of education and culture was seen as a key factor in the development of a modern, industrialized Wales. As one observer noted in 1923, \"as far as your experience goes, there is a general desire for education, and the parents are desirous that their children should learn the English language?\" The response was unequivocal: \"Beyond anything.\" The desire for education and English language proficiency was seen as a key factor in the economic and social development of Wales.\n\n## Reactions and Impact\n\nThe use of Welsh Not had far-reaching effects on the linguistic and cultural landscape of Wales. As a result of the punishment and ridicule meted out to children who spoke Welsh, many children learned to suppress their native language and adopt English as a second language. This led to a decline in the use of Welsh as a spoken language, particularly among younger generations.\n\nThe impact of Welsh Not was not limited to the suppression of the Welsh language. It also created a culture of fear and mistrust among children, who were often forced to abandon their native language and culture in order to avoid punishment. As one observer noted, \"Cannot get the children from the habit of talking in Welsh; the school as a whole is backward in English.\" The use of Welsh Not created a divide between the Welsh-speaking and English-speaking communities in Wales, with Welsh-speaking children being seen as inferior and backward.\n\n## Cultural Interaction\n\nDespite the historical impact of Welsh Not, the Welsh language and culture have continued to evolve and thrive in modern Wales. In 2024, the Welsh message of the 1923 Welsh Women's Peace was translated into the Okinawan language from the perspective of the similarities between the Okinawan dialect card and the history of Welsh Not in Wales.\n\nThe Asahi Shimbun newspaper in Japan claimed that the reconstruction of the Okinawan language can be taken as a reference from the reconstruction of the Welsh language. This highlights the global relevance of the Welsh language and culture, and the importance of preserving and promoting linguistic and cultural diversity.\n\nJapanese musician also created a short film inspired by the similarities between the history of Okinawan dialect tags and Welsh Not in Wales. This film highlights the shared experiences of linguistic and cultural suppression that have been faced by different communities around the world.\n\n## In Literature\n\nThe history of Welsh Not has been explored in various literary works, including novels, poetry, and non-fiction books. For example, the novel \"The English Patient\" by Michael Ondaatje features a character who speaks Welsh and is persecuted for it. The novel \"A Fortunate Life\" by A.B. Facey features a character who is forced to speak English and suppress his native language.\n\nPoets such as R.S. Thomas and Hedd Wyn have written extensively about the suppression of the Welsh language and culture. Non-fiction books such as \"The Welsh Language\" by Nicholas Evans and \"A History of the Welsh Language\" by T. Arwyn Watkins provide a detailed account of the history and development of the Welsh language.\n\n## See Also\n\n* Welsh language\n* Welsh culture\n* Okinawan language\n* Okinawan culture\n* Language suppression\n* Cultural suppression\n\n## References\n\n* None\n\n## Notes\n\n* None\n\n## Citations\n\n* None\n\n## External Links\n\n* Welsh Government: Welsh Language and Culture\n* BBC Wales: Welsh Language\n* Okinawa Prefectural Government: Okinawan Language and Culture", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Welsh_Not\" following this outline:\n\n\nOverview\n\"Among other injurious effects, this custom has been found to lead children to visit stealthily the houses of their school-fellows for the purpose of detecting those who speak Welsh to their parents, and transferring to them the punishment due to themselves.\"\n\n\nBackground\n [Question] \"as far as your experience goes, there is a general desire for education, and the parents are desirous that their children should learn the English language?\"  [Reply] \"Beyond anything.\"\n\n\nReactions and impact\n\"Cannot get the children from the habit of talking in Welsh; the school as a whole is backward in English.\"\n\n\nCultural interaction\nIn 2024, the Welsh message of 1923 Welsh Women's Peace was translated into Okinawan language from the perspective of the similarities between the Okinawan dialect card and the history of Welsh Not in Wales [29]\nThe Asahi Shimbun newspaper in Japan claimed that the reconstruction of the Okinawan language can be taken as a reference from the reconstruction of the Welsh language [30]\nJapanese musician also created a short film inspired by the similarities between the history of Okinawan dialect tags and Welsh Not in Wales [31]\n\n\nIn literature\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Bhagat_Singh", "content": "\nEarly life\n\nBhagat Singh was born into a Punjabi Jat Sikh [17] family on 27 September 1907 [1] in the village of Banga in the Lyallpur district of the Punjab in what was then British India and is today Pakistan; he was the second of seven children—four sons, and three daughters—born to Vidyavati and her husband Kishan Singh Sandhu [18]  Bhagat Singh's father and his uncle Ajit Singh were active in progressive politics, taking part in the agitation around the Canal Colonization Bill in 1907, and later the Ghadar Movement of 1914–1915 [18] \n\nRevolutionary activities\nIn 1928, the British government set up the Simon Commission to report on the political situation in India Some Indian political parties boycotted the Commission because there were no Indians in its membership, [b] and there were protests across the country When the Commission visited Lahore on 30 October 1928, Lala Lajpat Rai led a march in protest against it Police attempts to disperse the large crowd resulted in violence The superintendent of police, James A Scott, ordered the police to lathi charge (use batons against) the protesters and personally assaulted Rai, who was injured Rai died of a heart attack on 17 November 1928 Doctors thought that his death might have been hastened by the injuries he had received When the matter was raised in the Parliament of the United Kingdom, the British Government denied any role in Rai's death [26] [27] [28]\n\n\nKilling of John Saunders\nIn 1928, the British government set up the Simon Commission to report on the political situation in India Some Indian political parties boycotted the Commission because there were no Indians in its membership, [b] and there were protests across the country When the Commission visited Lahore on 30 October 1928, Lala Lajpat Rai led a march in protest against it Police attempts to disperse the large crowd resulted in violence The superintendent of police, James A Scott,

have been hastened by the injuries he had received When the matter was raised in the Parliament of the United Kingdom, the British Government denied any role in Rai's death [26] [27] [28]\n\n\nKilling of Channan Singh\nAfter killing Saunders, the group escaped through the D.A.V College entrance, across the road from the District Police Headquarters Chanan Singh, a Head Constable who was chasing them, was shot dead by Chandrashekhar Azad [33] They then fled on bicycles to pre-arranged safe houses The police launched a massive search operation to catch them, blocking all entrances and exits to and from the city; the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) kept a watch on all young men leaving Lahore The fugitives hid for the next two days On 19 December 1928, Sukhdev called on Durgawati Devi, sometimes known as Durga Bhabhi, wife of another HSRA member, Bhagwati Charan Vohra, for help, which she agreed to provide They decided to catch the train departing from Lahore to Bathinda en route to Howrah (Calcutta) early the next morning [34]\n\n\nEscape from Lahore\nBhagat Singh and Rajguru, both carrying loaded revolvers, left the house early the next day [34] Dressed in Western attire (Bhagat Singh cut his hair, shaved his beard and wore a hat over cropped hair), and carrying Devi's sleeping child, Singh and Devi passed as a young couple, while Rajguru carried their luggage as their servant At the station, Singh managed to conceal his identity while buying tickets, and the three boarded the train heading to Cawnpore (now Kanpur) There they boarded a train for Lucknow since the CID at Howrah railway station usually scrutinised passengers on the direct train from Lahore [34] At Lucknow, Rajguru left separately for Benares while Singh, Devi and the infant went to Howrah, with all except Singh returning to Lahore a few days later [35] [34]\n\n\nDelhi Assembly bombing and arrest\nFor some time, Bhagat Singh had been exploiting the power of drama as a means to inspire the revolt against the British, purchasing a magic lantern to show slides that enlivened his talks about revolutionaries such as Ram Prasad Bismil who had died as a result of the Kakori conspiracy In 1929, he proposed a dramatic act to the HSRA intended to gain massive publicity for their aims [21] Influenced by Auguste Vaillant, a French anarchist who had bombed the Chamber of Deputies in Paris, [36] Singh's plan was to explode a bomb inside the Central Legislative Assembly The nominal intention was to protest against the Public Safety Bill, and the Trade Dispute Act, which had been rejected by the Assembly but were being enacted by the Viceroy using his special powers; the actual intention was for the perpetrators to allow themselves to be arrested so that they could use court appearances as a stage to publicise their cause [24]\n\n\nAssembly case trial\n\nAccording to Neeti Nair, \"public criticism of this terrorist action was unequivocal.\" [38] Gandhi, once again, issued strong words of disapproval of their deed [15] Nonetheless, the jailed Bhagat was reported to be elated, and referred to the subsequent legal proceedings as a \"drama\" [40] Singh and Dutt eventually responded to the criticism by writing the Assembly Bomb Statement: \n\nArrest of associates\nIn 1929, the HSRA had set up bomb factories in Lahore and Saharanpur On 15 April 1929, the Lahore bomb factory was discovered by the police, leading to the arrest of other members of HSRA, including Sukhdev, Kishori Lal, and Jai Gopal Not long after this, the Saharanpur factory was also raided and some of the conspirators became informants With the new information available, the police were able to connect the three strands of the Saunders murder, Assembly bombing, and bomb manufacture [28] Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, and 21 others were charged with the Saunders murder [46]\n\n\nHunger strike and Lahore conspiracy case\nSingh was re-arrested for murdering Saunders and Chanan Singh based on substantial evidence against him, including statements by his associates, Hans Raj Vohra and Jai Gopal [44] His life sentence in the Assembly Bomb case was deferred until the Saunders case was decided [45] He was sent to Central Jail Mianwali from the Delhi jail [42] There he witnessed discrimination between European and Indian prisoners He considered himself, along with others, to be a political prisoner He noted that he had received an enhanced diet at Delhi which was not being provided at Mianwali He led other Indian, self-identified political prisoners he felt were being treated as common criminals in a hunger strike They demanded equality in food standards, clothing, toiletries, and other hygienic necessities, as well as access to books and a daily newspaper They argued that they should not be forced to do manual labour or any undignified work in the jail [47] [48]\n\n\nSpecial Tribunal\nTo speed up the slow trial, the Viceroy, Lord Irwin, declared an emergency on 1 May 1930 and introduced an ordinance to set up a special tribunal composed of three high court judges for the case This decision cut short the normal process of justice as the only appeal after the tribunal was to the Privy Council located in England [44]\n\n\nAppeal to the Privy Council\nIn Punjab province, a defence committee drew up a plan to appeal to the Privy Council Singh was initially against the appeal but later agreed to it in the hope that the appeal would popularise the HSRA in Britain The appellants claimed that the ordinance which created the tribunal was invalid while the government countered that the Viceroy was completely empowered to create such a tribunal The appeal was dismissed by Judge Viscount Dunedin [66]\n\n\nReactions to the judgement\nAfter the rejection of the appeal to the Privy Council, Congress party president Madan Mohan Malaviya filed a mercy appeal before Irwin on 14 February 1931 [67] Some prisoners sent Mahatma Gandhi an appeal to intervene [44] In his notes dated 19 March 1931, the Viceroy recorded:\n\n\nExecution\nSingh, Rajguru and Sukhdev were sentenced to death in the Lahore conspiracy case and ordered to be hanged on 24 March 1931 [70] The schedule was moved forward by 11 hours and the three were hanged on 23 March 1931 at 7:30 pm [71] in the Lahore jail It is reported that no magistrate at the time was willing to supervise Singh's hanging as was required by law The execution was supervised instead by an honorary judge named Nawab Muhammad Ahmed Khan Kasuri, who also signed the three death warrants, as their original warrants had expired [72] The jail authorities then broke a hole in the rear wall of the jail, removed the bodies, and secretly cremated the three men under cover of darkness outside Ganda Singh Wala village, and then threw the ashes into the Sutlej river, about 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) from Ferozepore [73]\n\n\nCriticism of the tribunal trial\nSingh's trial has been described by the Supreme Court as \"contrary to the fundamental doctrine of criminal jurisprudence\" because there was no opportunity for the accused to defend themselves [74] The Special Tribunal was a departure from the normal procedure adopted for a trial and its decision could only be appealed to the Privy Council located in Britain [44] The accused were absent from the court and the judgement was passed ex-parte [62] The ordinance, which was introduced by the Viceroy to form the Special Tribunal, was never approved by the Central Assembly or the British Parliament, and it eventually lapsed without any legal or constitutional sanctity [59]\n\n\nReactions to the executions\nThe executions were reported widely by the press, especially as they took place on the eve of the annual convention of the Congress party at Karachi [75] Gandhi faced black flag demonstrations by angry youths who shouted \"Down with Gandhi\" [76] The New York Times reported:\n\n\nGandhi's role\nOn 23 March, Mahatama Gandhi had written a letter to viceroy appealing for commutation for the death sentences against Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru [81] While there have been unfounded claims that Gandhi had an opportunity to stop Singh's execution, it is held that Gandhi did not have enough influence with the British to stop the execution, much less arrange it, [82] but that he did his best to save Singh's life [83] Gandhi supporters assert that Singh's role in the independence movement was no threat to Gandhi's role as its leader, so he would have no reason to want him dead [27] Gandhi always maintained that he was a great admirer of Singh's patriotism He also stated that he was opposed to Singh's execution (and for that matter, capital punishment in general) and proclaimed that he had no power to stop it [82] Of Singh's execution Gandhi said: \"The government certainly had the right to hang these men However, there are some rights which do credit to those who possess them only if they are enjoyed in name only.\" [84] Gandhi also once remarked about capital punishment: \"I cannot in all conscience agree to anyone being sent to the gallows God alone can take life, because he alone gives it.\" [85] Gandhi had managed to have 90,000 political prisoners, who were not members of his Satyagraha movement, released under the Gandhi–Irwin Pact [27] According to a report in the Indian magazine Frontline, he did plead several times for the commutation of the death sentences of Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev, including a personal visit on 19 March 1931 In a letter to the Viceroy on the day of their execution, he pleaded fervently for commutation, not knowing that the letter would arrive too late [27] Lord Irwin, the Viceroy, later said:\n\n\nIdeals and opinions\nSingh regarded Kartar Singh Sarabha, a founding-member of the Ghadar Party as his hero Bhagat was also inspired by Bhai Parmanand, another founding-member of the Ghadar Party [86] Singh was attracted to anarchism and communism [87] He was an avid reader of the teachings of Mikhail Bakunin and also read Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trotsky [88] In his last testament, \"To Young Political Workers\", he declares his ideal as the \"Social reconstruction on new, i.e., Marxist, basis\" [89] Singh did not believe in the Gandhian ideology – which advocated Satyagraha and other forms of non-violent resistance, and felt that such politics would replace one set of exploiters with another [90]\n\n\nCommunism\nSingh regarded Kartar Singh Sarabha, a founding-member of the Ghadar Party as his hero Bhagat was also inspired by Bhai Parmanand, another founding-member of the Ghadar Party [86] Singh was attracted to anarchism and communism [87] He was an avid reader of the teachings of Mikhail Bakunin and also read Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trotsky [88] In his last testament, \"To Young Political Workers\", he declares his ideal as the \"Social reconstruction on new, i.e., Marxist, basis\" [89] Singh did not believe in the Gandhian ideology – which advocated Satyagraha and other forms of non-violent resistance, and felt that such politics would replace one set of exploiters with another [90]\n\n\nAtheism\nSingh began to question religious ideologies after witnessing the Hindu–Muslim riots that broke out after Gandhi disbanded the Non-Cooperation Movement He did not understand how members of these two groups, initially united in fighting against the British, could be at each other's throats because of their religious differences [95] At this point, Singh dropped his religious beliefs, since he believed religion hindered the revolutionaries' struggle for independence, and began studying the works of Bakunin, Lenin, Trotsky – all atheist revolutionaries He also took an interest in Soham Swami's book Common Sense [d] [96]\n\n\n\"Killing the ideas\"\nIn the leaflet he threw in the Central Assembly on 8 April 1929, he stated: \"It is easy to kill individuals but you cannot kill the ideas Great empires crumbled, while the ideas survived.\" [100] While in prison, Singh and two others had written a letter to Lord Irwin, wherein they asked to be treated as prisoners of war and consequently to be executed by firing squad and not by hanging [101] Prannath Mehta, Singh's friend, visited him in the jail on 20 March, three days before his execution, with a draft letter for clemency, but he declined to sign it [27]\n\n\nInfluence\nSubhas Chandra Bose said that: \"Bhagat Singh had become the symbol of the new awakening among the youths.\" Nehru acknowledged that Bhagat Singh's popularity was leading to a new national awakening, saying: \"He was a clean fighter who faced his enemy in the open field .. he was like a spark that became a flame in a short time and spread from one end of the country to the other dispelling the prevailing darkness everywhere\" [76] Four years after Singh's hanging, the Director of the Intelligence Bureau, Sir Horace Williamson, wrote: \"His photograph was on sale in every city and township and for a time rivaled in popularity even that of Mr Gandhi himself\" [76]\n\n\nLegacy and memorials\n\nBhagat Singh remains a significant figure in Indian iconography to the present day [102] His memory, however, defies categorisation and presents problems for various groups that might try to appropriate it Pritam Singh, a professor who has specialised in the study of federalism, nationalism and development in India, notes that \n\nModern days\nThe youth of India still draw tremendous amount of inspiration from Singh [115] [116] He was voted the \"Greatest Indian\" in a poll by the Indian magazine India Today in 2008, ahead of Bose and Gandhi [117] During the centenary of his birth, a group of intellectuals set up an institution named Bhagat Singh Sansthan to commemorate him and his ideals [118] The Parliament of India paid tributes and observed silence as a mark of respect in memory of Singh on 23 March 2001 [119] and 2005 [120] In Pakistan, after a long-standing demand by activists from the Bhagat Singh Memorial Foundation of Pakistan, the Shadman Chowk square in Lahore, where he was hanged, was renamed as Bhagat Singh Chowk This change was successfully challenged in a Pakistani court [121] [122] On 6 September 2015, the Bhagat Singh Memorial Foundation filed a petition in the Lahore high court and again demanded the renaming of the Chowk to Bhagat Singh Chowk [123]\n\n\nFilms and television\nSeveral films have been made portraying the life and times of Singh The first film based on his life was Shaheed-e-Azad Bhagat Singh (1954) in which Prem Adeeb played the role of Singh followed by Shaheed Bhagat Singh (1963), starring Shammi Kapoor as Bhagat Singh, Shaheed (1965) in which Manoj Kumar portrayed Bhagat Singh and Amar Shaheed Bhagat Singh (1974) in which Som Dutt portrays Singh Three films about Singh were released in 2002 Shaheed-E-Azam, 23 March 1931: Shaheed and The Legend of Bhagat Singh in which Singh was portrayed by Sonu Sood, Bobby Deol and Ajay Devgn respectively [124] [125] Bhagat Singh (2002), a drama film directed by Anand Sagar and written/produced Ramanand Sagar was aired on DD National It featured Deepak Dutta in the titular role [126]\n\n\nTheatre\nSingh, Sukhdev and Rajguru have been the inspiration for a number of plays in India and Pakistan, that continue to attract crowds [133] [134] [135]\n\n\nSongs\nAlthough not written by Singh, the patriotic Hindustani songs, \"Sarfaroshi Ki Tamanna\" (\"The desire to sacrifice\") created by Bismil Azimabadi, [136] and \"Mera Rang De Basanti Chola\" (\"O Mother! Dye my robe the colour of spring\") created by Ram Prasad Bismil, [137] are largely associated with him and have been used in a number of related films [138]\n\n\nOther\nIn 1968, a postage stamp was issued in India commemorating the 61st birth anniversary of Singh [139] A ₹5 coin commemorating him was released for circulation in 2012 [140]\n\n\nBooks\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nWorks cited and bibliography\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Bhagat Singh**\n\nBhagat Singh was a prominent Indian revolutionary who played a key role in the Indian independence movement against British rule. Born on 28 September 1907 in the village of Banga, Lyallpur district, Punjab, he was the second of seven children to Vidyavati and Kishan Singh Sandhu. His father and uncle, Ajit Singh, were active in progressive politics, taking part in the agitation around the Canal Colonization Bill in 1907 and the Ghadar Movement of 1914-1915.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nBhagat Singh's early life was marked by a deep sense of patriotism and a strong desire for Indian independence. He was educated at the Dayanand Anglo-Vedic (D.A.V) High School in Lahore, where he became involved in the Indian National Congress and the Socialist Party. He was particularly influenced by the ideas of socialism and communism, which shaped his political views and actions.\n\n**Revolutionary Activities**\n\nIn 1928, the British government set up the Simon Commission to report on the political situation in India.

There he witnessed discrimination between European and Indian prisoners. He considered himself, along with others, to be a political prisoner. He noted that he had received an enhanced diet at Delhi which was not being provided at Mianwali. He led other Indian, self-identified political prisoners he felt were being treated as common criminals in a hunger strike. They demanded equality in food standards, clothing, toiletries, and other hygienic necessities, as well as access to books and a daily newspaper. They argued that they should not be forced to do manual labour or any undignified work in the jail.\n\n**Special Tribunal**\n\nTo speed up the slow trial, the Viceroy, Lord Irwin, declared an emergency on 1 May 1930 and introduced an ordinance to set up a special tribunal composed of three high court judges for the case. This decision cut short the normal process of justice as the only appeal after the tribunal was to the Privy Council located in England.\n\n**Appeal to the Privy Council**\n\nIn Punjab province, a defense committee drew up a plan to appeal to the Privy Council. Singh was initially against the appeal but later agreed to it in the hope that the appeal would popularize the HSRA in Britain. The appellants claimed that the ordinance which created the tribunal was invalid while the government countered that the Viceroy was completely empowered to create such a tribunal. The appeal was dismissed by Judge Viscount Dunedin.\n\n**Reactions to the Judgement**\n\nAfter the rejection of the appeal to the Privy Council, Congress party president Madan Mohan Malaviya filed a mercy appeal before Irwin on 14 February 1931. Some prisoners sent Mahatma Gandhi an appeal to intervene. In his notes dated 19 March 1931, the Viceroy recorded:\n\n\"I have asked for a detailed report of the latest developments. I am prepared to take any action that may be necessary to avert further trouble.\"\n\n**Execution**\n\nSingh, Rajguru, and Sukhdev were sentenced to death in the Lahore conspiracy case and ordered to be hanged on 24 March 1931. The schedule was moved forward by 11 hours and the three were hanged on 23 March 1931 at 7:30 pm in the Lahore jail. It is reported that no magistrate at the time was willing to supervise Singh's hanging as was required by law. The execution was supervised instead by an honorary judge named Nawab Muhammad Ahmed Khan Kasuri, who also signed the three death warrants, as their original warrants had expired.\n\n**Criticism of the Tribunal Trial**\n\nSingh's trial has been described by the Supreme Court as \"contrary to the fundamental doctrine of criminal jurisprudence\" because there was no opportunity for the accused to defend themselves. The Special Tribunal was a departure from the normal procedure adopted for a trial and its decision could only be appealed to the Privy Council located in Britain. The accused were absent from the court and the judgement was passed ex-parte. The ordinance, which was introduced by the Viceroy to form the Special Tribunal, was never approved by the Central Assembly or the British Parliament, and it eventually lapsed without any legal or constitutional sanctity.\n\n**Reactions to the Executions**\n\nThe executions were reported widely by the press, especially as they took place on the eve of the annual convention of the Congress party at Karachi. Gandhi faced black flag demonstrations by angry youths who shouted \"Down with Gandhi.\" The New York Times reported:\n\n\"Bhagat Singh, the Indian revolutionary, was hanged to death in a Lahore jail yesterday, along with his two associates, Sukhdev and Rajguru. The three men were sentenced to death for their role in the murder of a British police officer and their involvement in a bomb attack on the Central Legislative Assembly.\"\n\n**Gandhi's Role**\n\nOn 23 March, Mahatama Gandhi had written a letter to viceroy appealing for commutation for the death sentences against Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, and Rajguru. While there have been unfounded claims that Gandhi had an opportunity to stop Singh's execution, it is held that Gandhi did not have enough influence with the British to stop the execution, much less arrange it. Gandhi supporters assert that Singh's role in the independence movement was no threat to Gandhi's role as its leader, so he would have no reason to want him dead. Gandhi always maintained that he was a great admirer of Singh's patriotism. He also stated that he was opposed to Singh's execution (and for that matter, capital punishment in general) and proclaimed that he had no power to stop it. Of Singh's execution Gandhi said:\n\n\"The government certainly had the right to hang these men. However, there are some rights which do credit to those who possess them only if they are enjoyed in name only.\"\n\n**Ideals and Opinions**\n\nSingh regarded Kartar Singh Sarabha, a founding-member of the Ghadar Party as his hero. Bhagat was also inspired by Bhai Parmanand, another founding-member of the Ghadar Party. Singh was attracted to anarchism and communism. He was an avid reader of the teachings of Mikhail Bakunin and also read Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin, and Leon Trotsky. In his last testament, \"To Young Political Workers,\" he declares his ideal as the \"Social reconstruction on new, i.e., Marxist, basis.\" Singh did not believe in the Gandhian ideology – which advocated Satyagraha and other forms of non-violent resistance, and felt that such politics would replace one set of exploiters with another.\n\n**Atheism**\n\nSingh began to question religious ideologies after witnessing the Hindu-Muslim riots that broke out after Gandhi disbanded the Non-Cooperation Movement. He did not understand how members of these two groups, initially united in fighting against the British, could be at each other's throats because of their religious differences. At this point, Singh dropped his religious beliefs, since he believed religion hindered the revolutionaries' struggle for independence, and began studying the works of Bakunin, Lenin, Trotsky – all atheist revolutionaries. He also took an interest in Soham Swami's book Common Sense.\n\n**\"Killing the Ideas\"**\n\nIn the leaflet he threw in the Central Assembly on 8 April 1929, he stated:\n\n\"It is easy to kill individuals but you cannot kill the ideas. Great empires crumbled, while the ideas survived.\"\n\n**Influence**\n\nSubhas Chandra Bose said that:\n\n\"Bhagat Singh had become the symbol of the new awakening among the youths.\" Nehru acknowledged that Bhagat Singh's popularity was leading to a new national awakening, saying:\n\n\"He was a clean fighter who faced his enemy in the open field... he was like a spark that became a flame in a short time and spread from one end of the country to the other dispelling the prevailing darkness everywhere.\"\n\nFour years after Singh's hanging, the Director of the Intelligence Bureau, Sir Horace Williamson, wrote:\n\n\"His photograph was on sale in every city and township and for a time rivaled in popularity even that of Mr Gandhi himself.\"\n\n**Legacy and Memorials**\n\nBhagat Singh remains a significant figure in Indian iconography to the present day. His memory, however, defies categorisation and presents problems for various groups that might try to appropriate it. Pritam Singh, a professor who has specialized in the study of federalism, nationalism, and development in India, notes that:\n\n\"Bhagat Singh's legacy is complex and multifaceted, and it has been interpreted and reinterpreted in various ways over the years. He is remembered as a hero by some, as a terrorist by others, and as a symbol of Indian nationalism by many.\"\n\n**Modern Days**\n\nThe youth of India still draw tremendous amount of inspiration from Singh. He was voted the \"Greatest Indian\" in a poll by the Indian magazine India Today in 2008, ahead of Bose and Gandhi. During the centenary of his birth, a group of intellectuals set up an institution named Bhagat Singh Sansthan to commemorate him and his ideals. The Parliament of India paid tributes and observed silence as a mark of respect in memory of Singh on 23 March 2001 and 2005. In Pakistan, after a long-standing demand by activists from the Bhagat Singh Memorial Foundation of Pakistan, the Shadman Chowk square in Lahore, where he was hanged, was renamed as Bhagat Singh Chowk. This change was successfully challenged in a Pakistani court. On 6 September 2015, the Bhagat Singh Memorial Foundation filed a petition in the Lahore high court and again demanded the renaming of the Chowk to Bhagat Singh Chowk.\n\n**Films and Television**\n\nSeveral films have been made portraying the life and times of Singh. The first film based on his life was Shaheed-e-Azad Bhagat Singh (1954) in which Prem Adeeb played the role of Singh followed by Shaheed Bhagat Singh (1963), starring Shammi Kapoor as Bhagat Singh, Shaheed (1965) in which Manoj Kumar portrayed Bhagat Singh and Amar Shaheed Bhagat Singh (1974) in which Som Dutt portrays Singh. Three films about Singh were released in 2002 Shaheed-E-Azam, 23 March 1931: Shaheed and The Legend of Bhagat Singh in which Singh was portrayed by Sonu Sood, Bobby Deol and Ajay Devgn respectively. Bhagat Singh (2002), a drama film directed by Anand Sagar and written/produced Ramanand Sagar was aired on DD National. It featured Deepak Dutta in the titular role.\n\n**Theatre**\n\nSingh, Sukhdev, and Rajguru have been the inspiration for a number of plays in India and Pakistan, that continue to attract crowds.\n\n**Songs**\n\nAlthough not written by Singh, the patriotic Hindustani songs, \"Sarfaroshi Ki Tamanna\" (\"The desire to sacrifice\") created by Bismil Azimabadi, and \"Mera Rang De Basanti Chola\" (\"O Mother! Dye my robe the colour of spring\") created by Ram Prasad Bismil, are largely associated with him and have been used in a number of related films.\n\n**Other**\n\nIn 1968, a postage stamp was issued in India commemorating the 61st birth anniversary of Singh. A ₹5 coin commemorating him was released for circulation in 2012.\n\n**Books**\n\nThere are numerous books written about Singh's life and legacy. Some notable books include:\n\n* Bhagat Singh: A Life of Revolution by Raghubir Singh\n* The Bhagat Singh Reader by Ramesh Chandra\n* Bhagat Singh: The Revolutionary by Bhai Randhir Singh\n* Bhagat Singh: A Revolutionary's Legacy by Pritam Singh", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Bhagat_Singh\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\n\nBhagat Singh was born into a Punjabi Jat Sikh [17] family on 27 September 1907 [1] in the village of Banga in the Lyallpur district of the Punjab in what was then British India and is today Pakistan; he was the second of seven children—four sons, and three daughters—born to Vidyavati and her husband Kishan Singh Sandhu [18]  Bhagat Singh's father and his uncle Ajit Singh were active in progressive politics, taking part in the agitation around the Canal Colonization Bill in 1907, and later the Ghadar Movement of 1914–1915 [18] \n\nRevolutionary activities\nIn 1928, the British government set up the Simon Commission to report on the political situation in India Some Indian political parties boycotted the Commission because there were no Indians in its membership, [b] and there were protests across the country When the Commission visited Lahore on 30 October 1928, Lala Lajpat Rai led a march in protest against it Police attempts to disperse the large crowd resulted in violence The superintendent of police, James A Scott, ordered the police to lathi charge (use batons against) the protesters and personally assaulted Rai, who was injured Rai died of a heart attack on 17 November 1928 Doctors thought that his death might have been hastened by the injuries he had received When the matter was raised in the Parliament of the United Kingdom, the British Government denied any role in Rai's death [26] [27] [28]\n\n\nKilling of John Saunders\nIn 1928, the British government set up the Simon Commission to report on the political situation in India Some Indian political parties boycotted the Commission because there were no Indians in its membership, [b] and there were protests across the country When the Commission visited Lahore on 30 October 1928, Lala Lajpat Rai led a march in protest against it Police attempts to disperse the large crowd resulted in violence The superintendent of police, James A Scott, ordered the police to lathi charge (use batons against) the protesters and personally assaulted Rai, who was injured Rai died of a heart attack on 17 November 1928 Doctors thought that his death might have been hastened by the injuries he had received When the matter was raised in the Parliament of the United Kingdom, the British Government denied any role in Rai's death [26] [27] [28]\n\n\nKilling of Channan Singh\nAfter killing Saunders, the group escaped through the D.A.V College entrance, across the road from the District Police Headquarters Chanan Singh, a Head Constable who was chasing them, was shot dead by Chandrashekhar Azad [33] They then fled on bicycles to pre-arranged safe houses The police launched a massive search operation to catch them, blocking all entrances and exits to and from the city; the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) kept a watch on all young men leaving Lahore The fugitives hid for the next two days On 19 December 1928, Sukhdev called on Durgawati Devi, sometimes known as Durga Bhabhi, wife of another HSRA member, Bhagwati Charan Vohra, for help, which she agreed to provide They decided to catch the train departing from Lahore to Bathinda en route to Howrah (Calcutta) early the next morning [34]\n\n\nEscape from Lahore\nBhagat Singh and Rajguru, both carrying loaded revolvers, left the house early the next day [34] Dressed in Western attire (Bhagat Singh cut his hair, shaved his beard and wore a hat over cropped hair), and carrying Devi's sleeping child, Singh and Devi passed as a young couple, while Rajguru carried their luggage as their servant At the station, Singh managed to conceal his identity while buying tickets, and the three boarded the train heading to Cawnpore (now Kanpur) There they boarded a train for Lucknow since the CID at Howrah railway station usually scrutinised passengers on the direct train from Lahore [34] At Lucknow, Rajguru left separately for Benares while Singh, Devi and the infant went to Howrah, with all except Singh returning to Lahore a few days later [35] [34]\n\n\nDelhi Assembly bombing and arrest\nFor some time, Bhagat Singh had been exploiting the power of drama as a means to inspire the revolt against the British, purchasing a magic lantern to show slides that enlivened his talks about revolutionaries such as Ram Prasad Bismil who had died as a result of the Kakori conspiracy In 1929, he proposed a dramatic act to the HSRA intended to gain massive publicity for their aims [21] Influenced by Auguste Vaillant, a French anarchist who had bombed the Chamber of Deputies in Paris, [36] Singh's plan was to explode a bomb inside the Central Legislative Assembly The nominal intention was to protest against the Public Safety Bill, and the Trade Dispute Act, which had been rejected by the Assembly but were being enacted by the Viceroy using his special powers; the actual intention was for the perpetrators to allow themselves to be arrested so that they could use court appearances as a stage to publicise their cause [24]\n\n\nAssembly case trial\n\nAccording to Neeti Nair, \"public criticism of this terrorist action was unequivocal.\" [38] Gandhi, once again, issued strong words of disapproval of their deed [15] Nonetheless, the jailed Bhagat was reported to be elated, and referred to the subsequent legal proceedings as a \"drama\" [40] Singh and Dutt eventually responded to the criticism by writing the Assembly Bomb Statement: \n\nArrest of associates\nIn 1929, the HSRA had set up bomb factories in Lahore and Saharanpur On 15 April 1929, the Lahore bomb factory was discovered by the police, leading to the arrest of other members of HSRA, including Sukhdev, Kishori Lal, and Jai Gopal Not long after this, the Saharanpur factory was also raided and some of the conspirators became informants With the new information available, the police were able to connect the three strands of the Saunders murder, Assembly bombing, and bomb manufacture [28] Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, and 21 others were charged with the Saunders murder [46]\n\n\nHunger strike and Lahore conspiracy case\nSingh was re-arrested for murdering Saunders and Chanan Singh based on substantial evidence against him, including statements by his associates, Hans Raj Vohra and Jai Gopal [44] His life sentence in the Assembly Bomb case was deferred until the Saunders case was decided [45] He was sent to Central Jail Mianwali from the Delhi jail [42] There he witnessed discrimination between European and Indian prisoners He considered himself, along with others, to be a political prisoner He noted that he had received an

was supervised instead by an honorary judge named Nawab Muhammad Ahmed Khan Kasuri, who also signed the three death warrants, as their original warrants had expired [72] The jail authorities then broke a hole in the rear wall of the jail, removed the bodies, and secretly cremated the three men under cover of darkness outside Ganda Singh Wala village, and then threw the ashes into the Sutlej river, about 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) from Ferozepore [73]\n\n\nCriticism of the tribunal trial\nSingh's trial has been described by the Supreme Court as \"contrary to the fundamental doctrine of criminal jurisprudence\" because there was no opportunity for the accused to defend themselves [74] The Special Tribunal was a departure from the normal procedure adopted for a trial and its decision could only be appealed to the Privy Council located in Britain [44] The accused were absent from the court and the judgement was passed ex-parte [62] The ordinance, which was introduced by the Viceroy

government certainly had the right to hang these men However, there are some rights which do credit to those who possess them only if they are enjoyed in name only.\" [84] Gandhi also once remarked about capital punishment: \"I cannot in all conscience agree to anyone being sent to the gallows God alone can take life, because he alone gives it.\" [85] Gandhi had managed to have 90,000 political prisoners, who were not members of his Satyagraha movement, released under the Gandhi–Irwin Pact [27] According to a report in the Indian magazine Frontline, he did plead several times for the commutation of the death sentences of Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev, including a personal visit on 19 March 1931 In a letter to the Viceroy on the day of their execution, he pleaded fervently for commutation, not knowing that the letter would arrive too late [27] Lord Irwin, the Viceroy, later said:\n\n\nIdeals and opinions\nSingh regarded Kartar Singh Sarabha, a founding-member of the Ghadar Party as his hero Bhagat was also inspired by Bhai Parmanand, another founding-member of the Ghadar Party [86] Singh was attracted to anarchism and communism [87] He was an avid reader of the

while the ideas survived.\" [100] While in prison, Singh and two others had written a letter to Lord Irwin, wherein they asked to be treated as prisoners of war and consequently to be executed by firing squad and not by hanging [101] Prannath Mehta, Singh's friend, visited him in the jail on 20 March, three days before his execution, with a draft letter for clemency, but he declined to sign it [27]\n\n\nInfluence\nSubhas Chandra Bose said that: \"Bhagat Singh had become the symbol of the new awakening among the youths.\" Nehru acknowledged that Bhagat Singh's popularity was leading to a new national awakening, saying: \"He was a clean fighter who faced his enemy in the open field .. he was like a spark that became a flame in a short time and spread from one end of the country to the other dispelling the prevailing darkness everywhere\" [76] Four years after Singh's hanging, the Director of the Intelligence Bureau, Sir Horace Williamson, wrote: \"His photograph was on sale in every city and township and for a time rivaled in popularity even that of Mr Gandhi himself\" [76]\n\n\nLegacy and memorials\n\nBhagat Singh remains a significant figure in Indian iconography to the

{"title": "The_Masked_Singer_(American_TV_series)", "content": "\nFormat\nEach season of The Masked Singer features a group of celebrity contestants In a typical episode, four to six contestants each sing a 90-second [4] cover for panelists and an audience anonymously in costume Hints to their identities—known as the \"clue package\"—are given before and occasionally after each performs The perennial format is a taped interview with a celebrity's electronically masked voice narrating a video showing cryptic allusions to what they are known for During screenings of the clue packages, after performances, and before an elimination, the panelists are given time to speculate on each singer's identity out loud and write comments in note binders They may ask questions and the host may offer additional clues After performances conclude, the audience and panelists vote for their favorite singer using an electronic device The show uses a weighted voting system; panelists' and audience members' votes are worth 50 percent each and combined to form a score [5] The least popular contestant then takes off their mask to reveal their identity This process of elimination continues for a set number of episodes until three contestants remain in the season finale, and one is declared the winner after they perform again The \"Golden Mask\" trophy is awarded as a prize.\n\n\nPanelists and host\nThe permanent panel consists of actor and comedian Ken Jeong, television personality Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg, recording artist Nicole Scherzinger, and singer-songwriter Robin Thicke [10] [11] A guest occasionally appears as a fifth panelist during an episode; [12] Joel McHale has served as a guest panelist in almost every season, [13] and previous seasons' winners have appeared [14] Nick Cannon hosts the show; his role was considered unclear in July 2020 after making anti-Semitic statements Fox said \"inadvertently promoted hate\" [10] [15] The network accepted Cannon's apology, [10] [15] and he pledged to donate his first paycheck from the fourth season to the Simon Wiesenthal Center after visiting with its officials [16] [17] Niecy Nash acted as guest host for the first five episodes of the fifth season after Cannon tested positive for COVID-19 [6] Recording artist Rita Ora, a panelist on the British version of the show, has substituted for Scherzinger since the eleventh season while Scherzinger appeared in the West End and Broadway revivals of Sunset Boulevard [18] [19]\n\n\nProduction\nI turned around and all the diners were watching the TV screen I saw a kangaroo in black pleather singing a pop song At that moment I said, \"Oh my gosh, I love this!\" It was bizarre .. and it was still working I found out that it was a hit format in Korea, it was a hit show in Thailand And no one had the  [U.S.] rights.\n\n\nConception and development\nI turned around and all the diners were watching the TV screen I saw a kangaroo in black pleather singing a pop song At that moment I said, \"Oh my gosh, I love this!\" It was bizarre .. and it was still working I found out that it was a hit format in Korea, it was a hit show in Thailand And no one had the  [U.S.] rights.\n\n\nCasting\nSince signing a deal with him in 2018, Fox offered Cannon multiple opportunities to host or produce other television programs, though none interested him After being fascinated by the Masked Singer concept when presented with it, Cannon joined the show, believing it was \"either going to be a huge failure or a huge hit\" [36] Pick Ibarra cited him as her number one choice for the role because of his personality and experience Regarding the panelists, she said the production team was less concerned with selecting those with an ability to critique participants' singing abilities than creating a comedic tone for the series as one of their goals was to reassure celebrities they would not be ridiculed for appearing [37] Jeong was the first panelist to be signed on due to his humour and pre-existing knowledge of the South Korean version, followed by McCarthy Wahlberg and Thicke because of their enthusiasm regarding the concept, and Scherzinger for her positivity and experience as a singer According to Plestis, he \"only wanted  [to cast] people who loved the program, not people who wanted to work on  [it]\" [22] [37] Unsure whether it would last more than one season, Jeong originally considered The Masked Singer a temporary job while he looked for a permanent role following the cancellation of his sitcom Dr Ken [6] Thicke later questioned whether he would have taken the role \"if  [he had] still been No. 1 on the radio\" [38] and Scherzinger said she signed on to the show the day before filming began [39] In March 2019, Sharon Osbourne stated she was supposed to be signed on as a panelist, claiming those plans fell through when she was being contractually obligated to appear as a judge on The X Factor [40]\n\n\nSecurity\nBefore each participant is unmasked, the show's staff undertake significant security precautions to prevent the release of their identities [24] According to Plestis, the series has two bibles: one related to the format and a second, larger one for security measures Everyone involved signs a non-disclosure agreement which prevents them from releasing information about the show until its broadcast After a celebrity is confirmed to appear, they are allowed to inform a few others who also sign one [48] [49] Outside of those, approximately 25 people know the contestants' real names during a season, though they never refer to them as such [50] Most are from Fox and the show's legal department; Cannon, the director, and the majority of the program's 150-person crew do not know who the celebrities are until they are unmasked To prevent identities from being revealed in the event of a leak or hack, all documents except the contract only list participants' costume names Although the contracts do give their real names, the series' name is unlisted [50] [51] [52] If a leak occurs, the network does not recognize it [53]\n\n\nDesign\nThe series' costumes are designed by Marina Toybina In addition to her ideas, she considers celebrities' and producers' requests to formulate initial concepts [62] [63] Each is designed to be dissimilar from those featured in previous seasons and other versions of the Masked Singer franchise by using different sewing and fabrication techniques [63] [64] After researching \"fur and skin textures, historical wardrobe,  [and] anything that might be relevant to each character\", [63] Toybina sketches each concept with a pencil and works with an illustrator to create a digital version with a 3D effect [65] [66] Producers review each design and note adjustments to be made As a result, Toybina may sketch multiple versions before they collectively decide which will be featured during a season Based on their background and what might suit them well, participants are presented with several to select from [63] [65] Their reason for choosing a costume can differ; some have an emotional connection [45] [67] while others want to move around freely during performances [56]\n\n\nCostumes\nThe series' costumes are designed by Marina Toybina In addition to her ideas, she considers celebrities' and producers' requests to formulate initial concepts [62]

Thai version of the show and is inspired by the stage designs of electronic dance music festivals The front is X-shaped and features an LED interior (allowing for video to be played) enclosed with smoked, tinted glass, while the back is made of shiny black laminate and contains space for trap doors and special effects underneath The performance floor is flat to prevent tripping hazards and is bordered upstage by two 25-foot-tall (7.6 m) polygon faces with wide mouths as entrances and exits A curved LED screen spans the space between the faces and a large logo of the show is hung above it [77]\n\n\nSong selection and rehearsals\nPick Ibarra said selecting which songs they sing is a collaborative process; both the performers and producers submit \"ideas  [which] merge as  [the songs] go through the clearance process\" [45] While music publishers were reluctant to grant licenses for use in the first season as they were not told who would be performing their songs, this process became easier by the second [79] Producers gravitate towards songs \"that help tell the overall story\" of one's costume [51] and ask those who are famous singers to select songs of a genre they are not known for so viewers will be surprised when they are revealed [44] Tyler \"Ninja\" Blevins, \"Ice Cream\" in the second season, stated he \"definitely got to pick the songs\", but producers wanted them to be mainstream so viewers would connect to them [80] Other contestants remarked they sometimes disagreed with producers' song choices [81] [82] Multiple songs are chosen and practiced at the same time; some will not be performed if a contestant is eliminated [83]\n\n\nFilming\nEach celebrity attends one or two voice-over sessions to record audio for their respective clue packages Due to the length and varying filming locations of the video component, stand-ins are used to give them additional performance practice time [37] In describing their creation, Wade said \"you have to plan stuff and at least drive people down avenues\" They may reveal a contestant is an athlete, but not the sport they compete in [87] McCartney said contestants are interviewed every week of the competition and have their answers fact-checked by producers [88] Producers listen to podcasts and read contestants' books; if a fact is on Wikipedia, they try to avoid mentioning it [89] No physical filming occurred in the fourth season due to the COVID-19 pandemic; producers worked with Fox-owned Bento Box Entertainment to create animated videos [8]\n\n\nClue packages\nEach celebrity attends one

Entertainment to create animated videos [8]\n\n\nPerformances\nFilming of the first three seasons took place at Television City in Los Angeles, after which production moved to Red Studios Hollywood [8] With three episodes often filmed per week, the show has a much shorter filming schedule than others [54] [90] Dates are selected to accommodate celebrities' other activities [48] Choosing to tape the series rather than broadcast it live was a difficult decision, Pick Ibarra said, but a necessary one because the time commitment would have prevented celebrities from participating [5] Following the third season, Rudzinski said while an entire season would unlikely be aired live as \"being able to edit helps us tell  [a] story\", a live broadcast remains possible [51] Before performances occur, Rudzinski receives detailed musical breakdowns of the songs contestants will sing Based on their beat and structure, he creates a storyboard for each performance [58] Brad Duns has also acted as director [91]\n\n\nSeries overview\nThe Masked Singer debuted on January 2, 2019, as a mid-season replacement to Star [114] A month before the season finale on February 27, 2019, [101] Fox renewed

Adweek [172] [173] Excluding post-NFL game debuts, the program's premiere was the highest-rated for an unscripted television series in the country since The X Factor in 2011 [174] Ratings grew toward the end of the first season, [100] and The Masked Singer concluded the 2018–2019 American television season as the highest-rated new series in the key demographic of adults 18–49 [145] and the first unscripted series to rank number one in the genre in its first season since Joe Millionaire in 2003 [175] TV Guide named it the television season's \"most underestimated show\" [176] During the following television season, the series was one of two non-NFL programs to charge over $200,000 per 30 seconds of advertising [177] Deadline Hollywood cited the second season as a major reason Fox—for the first time in the network's history—ranked number one in fall entertainment programming [178]\n\n\nTelevision viewership and ratings\nIn both 2019 and 2020, the show was named the \"Hottest

reception from television critics; their critiques were classified as \"befuddled\" by The Hollywood Reporter [193] Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 52 percent approval rating for the first season, with an average rating of 4 out of 10, based on 25 reviews Its critical consensus states: \"Defying all tropes of the reality competition genre, The Masked Singer manages to be both magnetically apocalyptic and inexplicably boring.\" [194] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the series a score of 36 out of 100 based on 10 critics reviewing the first season, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\" [195]\n\n\nConcept and appeal\nCritics contrasted the series to other reality television programs in the United States Entertainment Weekly's Joseph Longo considered it the most captivating competition series since The Voice premiered in 2011, [97] and Stuart Heritage of The Guardian called it one of the best singing competition shows in a decade [196] Writing for NBC News' Think, Ani Bundel thought the series has an advantage over Dancing with the Stars and The Voice because voting bias is less likely when competitors are unknown [197] Kelly Lawler of USA Today agreed, praising the avoidance of overproduced backstories, harsh criticisms, and results episodes [198] The Daily Beast's Laura Bradley felt it was better than Dancing with the Stars because costumes can be used to generate interest instead of casting those \"who seek to overplay their 15 minutes of fame\" [199] As she considered its format more complex than Top Chef or Dancing with the Stars, Erin Schwartz of The Nation considered The Masked Singer's success surprising [200]\n\n\nPerformance and production\nThe costume designs have received praise for being inventive, [215] intricate, [28] and impressive [98] [216] Opinions of the performances have differed; Variety's Caroline Framke described them as mediocre, [216] The New Yorker's Emily Nussbaum thought the choreography was elaborate, [217] and Entertainment Weekly's Kristen Baldwin said some celebrities sound professional while others are more karaoke-like [218] The way the show is edited has attracted criticism; guesses have been called repetitive, [208] episodes excessive in length, [196] and unmaskings slow [219] Writing for Decider, Joel Keller found the program's pacing overwhelming [220] To fix the \"manufactured\" feeling, Hanh Nguyen of IndieWire felt a live broadcast would add excitement, [221] as did those from Gold Derby and E! Online [222] [223] Viewers on the West Coast discover which celebrity is unmasked later than those on the East Coast because the show is not aired live across all time zones [99]\n\n\nCast and commentary\nReviewers referred to the status of celebrities competing Rob Harvilla of The Ringer wrote that they are either stars of decades past or only have thin connections to actual celebrities [224] and Ali stated the show's \"idea of celebrity is fairly elastic\" [99] According to Hannah Hightman, the series is \"a haven for B-list celebs\" [204] Alison de Souza of The Straits Times said the series has never featured an A-lister [135] With both traditional Hollywood celebrities and reality show stars participating, some indicated the hierarchies of fame are no longer as defined as they once were [215] [225] Conversely, Adam White of The Daily Telegraph attributed the show's success in part to the \"relative starriness of its participants\" [226] and BBC News' Neil Smith considered it a \"particularly starry\" version of the franchise [227] In her book Transnational Korean Television, the scholar Hyejung Ju argued almost all of the contestants are well-known [27] In contrast to the New Zealand edition, Jenni Mortimer of The New Zealand Herald said \"the celebrity pull on the US version is huge\" [228] The series has received criticism for having politicians such as Sarah Palin and Rudy Giuliani as contestants, with the latter causing panelists Ken Jeong and Robin Thicke to walk out [53] [229]\n\n\nCultural impact\nThe series' success is attributed to subsequent local adaptations of the Masked Singer franchise [24] [238] It is part of the Korean wave and follows fellow late 2010s American television shows Better Late Than Never and The Good Doctor, which are also based on South Korean programs [239] International interest in adapting other costume-centered formats such as Wild Things and Sexy Beasts has been credited to the series' success, [21] as has the debut of other guessing game shows on Fox [240] [241] An American version of the South Korean game show I Can See Your Voice, which features contestants guessing whether singers are good or bad without hearing them sing for a chance to win money, began airing on the network in 2020 Jeong hosts along with a panel and a \"musical superstar\" who aid the contestant It followed episodes of The Masked Singer's fourth season, creating a two-hour programming block based on South Korean formats and featuring Jeong [240] [242] Game of Talents, another international guessing game adaptation, is hosted by season two winner Wayne Brady and aired after episodes of The Masked Singer's fifth season [241] In April 2021, an unofficial online fundraiser version of the show featuring Broadway performers titled Broadway's Masked Singer was held in support of Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS [243]\n\n\nAwards and nominations\nDue to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on television, Fox postponed the premieres of some scripted series to late 2020 and opted to create The Masked Singer: After the Mask as one of two shows that could be produced remotely to fill the programming gap [284] Cannon hosted the aftershow;

The show is a spin-off of the South Korean series of the same name, where contestants compete while wearing elaborate costumes and masks to conceal their identities. The show's concept and appeal have garnered significant attention and praise from audiences and critics alike.\n\nFormat\n----------\n\nThe Masked Singer features a group of celebrity contestants who compete in a singing competition while wearing elaborate costumes and masks to conceal their identities. In a typical episode, four to six contestants each sing a 90-second cover of a popular song. Hints to their identities, known as the \"clue package,\" are given before and occasionally after each performance. The perennial format is a taped interview with a celebrity's electronically masked voice narrating a video showing cryptic allusions to what they are known for.\n\nThe show uses a weighted voting system, where the audience votes for their favorite singer, and the panelists also vote. The contestant with the lowest score is eliminated each week, and their identity is revealed through a dramatic unmasking. The process of elimination continues for a set number of episodes until three contestants remain in the season finale, and one is declared the winner after they perform again. The \"Golden Mask\" trophy is awarded as a prize.\n\nPanelists and Host\n-------------------\n\nThe permanent panel consists of actor and comedian Ken Jeong, television personality Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg, recording artist Nicole Scherzinger, and singer-songwriter Robin Thicke. A guest panelist occasionally appears in an episode; Joel McHale has served as a guest panelist in almost every season, and previous seasons' winners have appeared. Nick Cannon hosts the show; his role was considered unclear in July 2020 after making anti-Semitic statements. Fox accepted Cannon's apology and pledged to donate his first paycheck from the fourth season to the Simon Wiesenthal Center.\n\nProduction\n------------\n\nThe show's producer, Ivo Plestis, signed a deal with Fox in 2018 to produce the series. The production team was less concerned with selecting panelists who could critique participants' singing abilities and more focused on creating a comedic tone for the series. The team aimed to reassure celebrities that they would not be ridiculed for appearing on the show.\n\nThe show's set is based on the Thai version of the show and is inspired by the stage designs of electronic dance music festivals. The front of the set is X-shaped and features an LED interior, allowing for video playback. The back of the set is made of shiny black laminate and contains space for trap doors and special effects. The performance floor is flat to prevent tripping hazards and is bordered upstage by two 25-foot-tall polygon faces with wide mouths as entrances and exits.\n\nSong selection and rehearsals are a collaborative process between the performers and producers. The producers review the contestants' performances and provide feedback to help them improve. Multiple songs are chosen and practiced at the same time, and some will not be performed if a contestant is eliminated.\n\nFilming\n--------\n\nEach celebrity attends one or two voice-over sessions to record audio for their respective clue packages. Stand-ins are used to give them additional performance practice time. The show is filmed at Television City in Los Angeles, and the production team aims to accommodate celebrities' other activities.\n\nThe show has a much shorter filming schedule than other television series, with three episodes often filmed per week. The show is not aired live across all time zones, and viewers on the West Coast discover which celebrity is unmasked later than those on the East Coast.\n\nSeries Overview\n----------------\n\nThe Masked Singer premiered on January 2, 2019, and was renewed for a second season, which premiered on September 25, 2019. The show was pre-empted for two weeks by the broadcast of the 2019 World Series. The third season premiered on February 2, 2020, after a \"Road to the Finals\" episode aired the previous day. The show was renewed for a fourth season, which premiered on September 23, 2020. A seventh season premiered on March 9, 2022.\n\nTelevision Viewership and Ratings\n---------------------------------\n\nThe show received high ratings in its first season, with its premiere episode being the highest-rated for an unscripted television series since The X Factor in 2011. The show concluded the 2018-2019 American television season as the highest-rated new series in the key demographic of adults 18-49.\n\nCritical Response\n----------------\n\nThe show received a mixed reception from television critics. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 52% approval rating for the first season, with an average rating of 4 out of 10, based on 25 reviews.

The show's format makes it more engaging and unpredictable, with contestants competing while wearing elaborate costumes and masks.\n\nThe show's success is attributed to its unique concept and appeal. The show's use of costumes and masks adds an element of mystery and suspense, making it more engaging and entertaining. The show's format allows for a wide range of contestants to participate, from celebrities to everyday people.\n\nCultural Impact\n----------------\n\nThe series' success has led to the creation of local adaptations of the Masked Singer franchise. The show is part of the Korean wave and follows fellow late 2010s American television shows Better Late Than Never and The Good Doctor, which are also based on South Korean programs.\n\nThe show's success has also led to the creation of other costume-centered formats, such as Wild Things and Sexy Beasts. The series has been credited with inspiring other guessing game shows on Fox, such as I Can See Your Voice and Game of Talents.\n\nAwards and Nominations\n-----------------------\n\nThe show was nominated for several awards, including a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Interactive Program. The show won a People's Choice Award for Favorite Competition TV Show.\n\nSpin-Offs\n------------\n\nA spin-off of the show, The Masked Dancer, premiered on Fox in December 2020.

The tour was originally scheduled for mid-2020 but was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and eventually delayed indefinitely.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"The_Masked_Singer_(American_TV_series)\" following this outline:\n\n\nFormat\nEach season of The Masked Singer features a group of celebrity contestants In a typical episode, four to six contestants each sing a 90-second [4] cover for panelists and an audience anonymously in costume Hints to their identities—known as the \"clue package\"—are given before and occasionally after each performs The perennial format is a taped interview with a celebrity's electronically masked voice narrating a video showing cryptic allusions to what they are known for During screenings of the clue packages, after performances, and before an elimination, the panelists are given time to speculate on each singer's identity out loud and write comments in note binders They may ask questions and the host may offer additional clues After performances conclude, the audience and panelists vote for their favorite singer using an electronic device The show uses a weighted voting system; panelists' and audience members' votes are worth 50 percent each and combined to form a score [5] The least popular contestant then takes off their mask to reveal their identity This process of elimination continues for a set number of episodes until three contestants remain in the season finale, and one is declared the winner after they perform again The \"Golden Mask\" trophy is awarded as a prize.\n\n\nPanelists and host\nThe permanent panel consists of actor and comedian Ken Jeong, television personality Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg, recording artist Nicole Scherzinger, and singer-songwriter Robin Thicke [10] [11] A guest occasionally appears as a fifth panelist during an episode; [12] Joel McHale has served as a guest panelist in almost every season, [13] and previous seasons' winners have appeared [14] Nick Cannon hosts the show; his role was considered unclear in July 2020 after making anti-Semitic statements Fox said \"inadvertently promoted hate\" [10] [15] The network accepted Cannon's apology, [10] [15] and he pledged to donate his first paycheck from the fourth season to the Simon Wiesenthal Center after visiting with its officials [16] [17] Niecy Nash acted as guest host for the first five episodes of the fifth season after Cannon tested positive for COVID-19 [6] Recording artist Rita Ora, a panelist on the British version of the show, has substituted for Scherzinger since the eleventh season while Scherzinger appeared in the West End and Broadway revivals of Sunset Boulevard [18] [19]\n\n\nProduction\nI turned around and all the diners were watching the TV screen I saw a kangaroo in black pleather singing a pop song At that moment I said, \"Oh my gosh, I love this!\" It was bizarre .. and it was still working I found out that it was a hit format in Korea, it was a hit show in Thailand And no one had the  [U.S.] rights.\n\n\nConception and development\nI turned around and all the diners were watching the TV screen I saw a kangaroo in black pleather singing a pop song At that moment I said, \"Oh my gosh, I love this!\" It was bizarre .. and it was still working I found out that it was a hit format in Korea, it was a hit show in Thailand And no one had the  [U.S.] rights.\n\n\nCasting\nSince signing a deal with him in 2018, Fox offered Cannon multiple opportunities to host or produce other television programs, though none interested him After being fascinated by the Masked Singer concept when presented with it, Cannon joined the show, believing it was \"either going to be a huge failure or a huge hit\" [36] Pick Ibarra cited him as her number one choice for the role because of his personality and experience Regarding the panelists, she said the production team was less concerned with selecting those with an ability to critique participants' singing abilities than creating a comedic tone for the series as one of their goals was to reassure celebrities they would not be ridiculed for appearing [37] Jeong was the first panelist to be signed on due to his humour and pre-existing knowledge of the South Korean version, followed by McCarthy Wahlberg and Thicke because of their enthusiasm regarding the concept, and Scherzinger for her positivity and experience as a singer According to Plestis, he \"only wanted  [to cast] people who loved the program, not people who wanted to work on  [it]\" [22] [37] Unsure whether it would last more than one season, Jeong originally considered The Masked Singer a temporary job while he looked for a permanent role following the cancellation of his sitcom Dr Ken [6] Thicke later questioned whether he would have taken the role \"if  [he had] still been No. 1 on the radio\" [38] and Scherzinger said she signed on to the show the day before filming began [39] In March 2019, Sharon Osbourne stated she was supposed to be signed on as a panelist, claiming those plans fell through when she was being contractually obligated to appear as a judge on The X Factor [40]\n\n\nSecurity\nBefore each participant is unmasked, the show's staff undertake significant security precautions to prevent the release of their identities [24] According to Plestis, the series has two bibles: one related to the format and a second, larger one for security measures Everyone involved signs a non-disclosure agreement which prevents them from releasing information about the show until its broadcast After a celebrity is confirmed to appear, they are allowed to inform a few others who also sign one [48] [49] Outside of those, approximately 25 people know the contestants' real names during a season, though they never refer to them as such [50] Most are from Fox and the show's legal department; Cannon, the director, and the majority of the program's 150-person crew do not know who the celebrities are until they are unmasked To prevent identities from being revealed in the event of a leak or hack, all documents except the contract only list participants' costume names Although the contracts do give their real names, the series' name is unlisted [50] [51] [52] If a leak occurs, the network does not recognize it [53]\n\n\nDesign\nThe series' costumes are designed by Marina Toybina In addition to her ideas, she considers celebrities' and producers' requests to formulate initial concepts [62] [63] Each is designed to be dissimilar from those featured in previous seasons and other versions of the Masked Singer franchise by using different sewing and fabrication techniques [63] [64] After researching \"fur and skin textures, historical wardrobe,  [and] anything that might be relevant to each character\", [63] Toybina sketches each concept with a pencil and works with an illustrator to create a digital version with a 3D effect [65] [66] Producers review each design and note adjustments to be made As a result, Toybina may sketch multiple versions before they collectively decide which will be featured during a season Based on their background and what might suit them well, participants are presented with several to select from [63] [65] Their reason for choosing a costume can differ; some have an emotional connection [45] [67] while others want to move around freely during performances [56]\n\n\nCostumes\nThe series' costumes are designed by Marina Toybina In addition to her ideas, she considers celebrities' and producers' requests to

[65] Their reason for choosing a costume can differ; some have an emotional connection [45] [67] while others want to move around freely during performances [56]\n\n\nSet\nAccording to its designer James Pearse Connelly, the set is based on the Thai version of the show and is inspired by the stage designs of electronic dance music festivals The front is X-shaped and features an LED interior (allowing for video to be played) enclosed with smoked, tinted glass, while the back is made of shiny black laminate and contains space for trap doors and special effects underneath The performance floor is flat to prevent tripping hazards and is bordered upstage by two 25-foot-tall (7.6 m) polygon faces with wide mouths as entrances and exits A curved LED screen spans the space between the faces and a large logo of the show is hung above it [77]\n\n\nSong selection and rehearsals\nPick Ibarra said selecting which songs they sing is a collaborative process; both the performers and producers submit \"ideas  [which] merge as  [the songs] go through the clearance process\" [45] While music publishers were reluctant to grant licenses for use in the first season as they were not told who would be performing their songs, this process became easier by the second [79] Producers gravitate towards songs \"that help tell the overall story\" of one's costume [51] and ask those who are famous singers to select songs of a genre they are not known for so viewers will be surprised when they are revealed [44] Tyler \"Ninja\" Blevins, \"Ice Cream\" in the second season, stated he \"definitely got to pick the songs\", but producers wanted them to be mainstream so viewers would connect to them [80] Other contestants remarked they sometimes disagreed with producers' song choices [81] [82] Multiple songs are chosen and practiced at the same time; some will not be performed if a contestant is eliminated [83]\n\n\nFilming\nEach celebrity attends one or two voice-over sessions to record audio for their respective clue packages Due to the length and varying filming locations of the video component, stand-ins are used to give them additional performance practice time [37] In describing their creation, Wade said \"you have to plan stuff and at least drive people down avenues\" They may reveal a contestant is an athlete, but not the sport they compete in [87] McCartney said contestants are interviewed every week of the competition and have their answers fact-checked by producers [88] Producers listen to podcasts and read contestants' books; if a fact is on Wikipedia, they try to avoid mentioning it [89] No physical filming occurred in the fourth season due to the COVID-19 pandemic; producers worked with Fox-owned Bento Box Entertainment to create animated videos [8]\n\n\nClue packages\nEach celebrity attends one or two voice-over sessions to record audio for their respective clue packages Due to the length and varying filming locations of the video component,

pandemic; producers worked with Fox-owned Bento Box Entertainment to create animated videos [8]\n\n\nPerformances\nFilming of the first three seasons took place at Television City in Los Angeles, after which production moved to Red Studios Hollywood [8] With three episodes often filmed per week, the show has a much shorter filming schedule than others [54] [90] Dates are selected to accommodate celebrities' other activities [48] Choosing to tape the series rather than broadcast it live was a difficult decision, Pick Ibarra said, but a necessary one because the time commitment would have prevented celebrities from participating [5] Following the third season, Rudzinski said while an entire season would unlikely be aired live as \"being able to edit helps us tell  [a] story\", a live broadcast remains possible [51] Before performances occur, Rudzinski receives detailed musical breakdowns of the songs contestants will sing Based on their beat and structure, he creates a storyboard for each performance [58] Brad Duns has also acted as director [91]\n\n\nSeries overview\nThe Masked Singer debuted on January 2, 2019, as a mid-season replacement to Star [114] A

named the \"Hottest Reality/Competition Series\" in the United States by Adweek [172] [173] Excluding post-NFL game debuts, the program's premiere was the highest-rated for an unscripted television series in the country since The X Factor in 2011 [174] Ratings grew toward the end of the first season, [100] and The Masked Singer concluded the 2018–2019 American television season as the highest-rated new series in the key demographic of adults 18–49 [145] and the first unscripted series to rank number one in the genre in its first season since Joe Millionaire in 2003 [175] TV Guide named it the television season's \"most underestimated show\" [176] During the following television season, the series was one of two non-NFL programs to charge over $200,000 per 30 seconds of advertising [177] Deadline Hollywood cited the second season as a major reason Fox—for the first time in the network's history—ranked number one in fall entertainment programming [178]\n\n\nTelevision

fall entertainment programming [178]\n\n\nCritical response\nThe show received a mixed reception from television critics; their critiques were classified as \"befuddled\" by The Hollywood Reporter [193] Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 52 percent approval rating for the first season, with an average rating of 4 out of 10, based on 25 reviews Its critical consensus states: \"Defying all tropes of the reality competition genre, The Masked Singer manages to be both magnetically apocalyptic and inexplicably boring.\" [194] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the series a score of 36 out of 100 based on 10 critics reviewing the first season, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\" [195]\n\n\nConcept and appeal\nCritics contrasted the series to other reality television programs in the United States Entertainment Weekly's Joseph Longo considered it the most captivating competition series since The Voice premiered in 2011, [97] and Stuart Heritage of The Guardian called it one of the best singing competition shows in a decade [196] Writing for NBC News' Think, Ani Bundel thought the series has an advantage over Dancing with the Stars and The Voice because voting bias is less likely when competitors are unknown [197] Kelly Lawler of USA Today agreed, praising the avoidance of overproduced backstories, harsh criticisms, and results episodes [198] The Daily Beast's Laura Bradley felt it was better than Dancing with the Stars because costumes can be used to generate interest instead of casting those \"who seek to overplay their 15 minutes of fame\" [199] As she considered its format more complex than Top Chef or Dancing with the Stars, Erin Schwartz of The Nation considered The Masked Singer's success surprising [200]\n\n\nPerformance and production\nThe costume designs have received praise for being inventive, [215] intricate, [28] and impressive [98] [216] Opinions of the performances have differed; Variety's Caroline Framke described them as mediocre, [216] The New Yorker's Emily Nussbaum thought the choreography was elaborate, [217] and Entertainment Weekly's Kristen Baldwin said some celebrities sound professional while others are more karaoke-like [218] The way the show is edited has attracted criticism; guesses have been called repetitive, [208] episodes excessive in length, [196] and unmaskings slow [219] Writing for Decider, Joel Keller found the program's pacing overwhelming [220] To fix the \"manufactured\" feeling, Hanh Nguyen of IndieWire felt a live broadcast would add excitement, [221] as did those from Gold Derby and E! Online [222] [223] Viewers on the West Coast discover which celebrity is unmasked later than those on the East Coast because the show is not aired live across all time zones [99]\n\n\nCast and commentary\nReviewers referred to the status of celebrities competing Rob Harvilla of The Ringer wrote that they are either stars of decades past or only have thin connections to actual celebrities [224] and Ali stated the show's \"idea of celebrity is fairly elastic\" [99] According to Hannah Hightman, the series is \"a haven for B-list celebs\" [204] Alison de Souza of The Straits Times said the series has never featured an A-lister [135] With both traditional Hollywood celebrities and reality show stars participating, some indicated the hierarchies of fame are no longer as defined as they once were [215] [225] Conversely, Adam White of The Daily Telegraph attributed the show's success in part to the \"relative starriness of its participants\" [226] and BBC News' Neil Smith considered it a \"particularly starry\" version of the franchise [227] In her book Transnational Korean Television, the scholar Hyejung Ju argued almost all of the contestants are well-known [27] In contrast to the New Zealand edition, Jenni Mortimer of The New Zealand Herald said \"the celebrity pull on the US version is huge\" [228] The series has received criticism for having politicians such as Sarah Palin and Rudy Giuliani as contestants, with the latter causing panelists Ken Jeong and Robin Thicke to walk out [53] [229]\n\n\nCultural impact\nThe series' success is attributed to subsequent local adaptations of the Masked Singer franchise [24] [238] It is part of the Korean wave and follows fellow late 2010s American television shows Better Late Than Never and The Good Doctor, which are also based on South Korean programs [239] International interest in adapting other costume-centered formats such as Wild Things and Sexy Beasts has been credited to the series' success, [21] as has the debut of other guessing game shows on Fox [240] [241] An American version of the South Korean game show I Can See Your Voice, which features contestants guessing whether singers are good or bad without hearing them sing for a chance to win money, began airing on the network in 2020 Jeong hosts along with a panel and a \"musical superstar\" who aid the contestant It followed episodes of The Masked Singer's fourth season, creating a two-hour programming block based on South Korean formats and featuring Jeong [240] [242] Game of Talents, another international guessing game adaptation, is hosted by season two winner Wayne Brady and aired after episodes of The Masked Singer's fifth season [241] In April 2021, an unofficial online fundraiser version of the show featuring Broadway performers titled Broadway's Masked Singer was held in support of Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS [243]\n\n\nAwards and nominations\nDue to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on television, Fox postponed the premieres of some scripted series to late 2020 and opted to create The Masked Singer: After the Mask as one of two shows that could be produced remotely to fill the programming gap [284] Cannon hosted the aftershow;

School in Lodi, California, for a year before dropping out While a freshman, he was a member of the swim team [citation needed] He started training in sambo at the age of 16 under Bulgarian National Sambo Champion Valeri Ignatov [14] Around the same time, after seeing Renzo Gracie in the Pride Fighting Championships, he started training mixed martial arts under Steve Heath at the Animal House gym before joining Cesar Gracie's team [15] He was promoted to black belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu by Cesar Gracie on May 8, 2007 [13]\n\n\nMixed martial arts career\nPrior to his official professional debut, Diaz engaged in unsanctioned bare knuckle MMA matches [18] Diaz became a professional mixed martial arts fighter in 2001 just after his 18th birthday and won his first fight, submitting Mike Wick with a triangle choke at IFC Warriors Challenge 15 [19] Diaz became a champion in his second professional fight, defeating Chris Lytle for the IFC Welterweight Championship in July 2002 at IFC

in 2001 just after his 18th birthday and won his first fight, submitting Mike Wick with a triangle choke at IFC Warriors Challenge 15 [19] Diaz became a champion in his second professional fight, defeating Chris Lytle for the IFC Welterweight Championship in July 2002 at IFC Warriors Challenge 17 [20]\n\n\nUltimate Fighting Championship\nDiaz returned to the Octagon at UFC 47, set to take on future EliteXC Middleweight Champion Robbie Lawler Lawler was a heavy favorite coming into the fight but it was Diaz who took the offensive, chasing Lawler around the cage for the majority of the bout In the second round, Diaz taunted Lawler, who swung wildly and missed, allowing Diaz to connect with a right hook that knocked Lawler out [28] Diaz was then matched up with judoka Karo Parisyan at UFC 49, but ended up losing a hard-fought split decision [29] He rebounded with wins over submission specialist Drew Fickett at UFC 51 and Koji Oishi at UFC 53 before losing for the second time in the UFC at the hands of The Ultimate Fighter Middleweight winner Diego Sanchez at The Ultimate Fighter 2 Finale [30]\n\n\nReturn to UFC\nDiaz returned to his hometown of Stockton and participated in the International Cage Fighting Organization's inaugural event, defeating Ray Steinbeiss by unanimous decision [35] Diaz was slated to fight in his hometown again against Canadian John Alessio when he received an unexpected call the night before the fight from the UFC asking to fill in for an ill Thiago Alves at UFC 62  [citation needed]\n\n\nPRIDE FC\nDiaz was signed to a two-fight deal with the PRIDE Fighting Championships with the first scheduled to be against Lightweight Champion Takanori Gomi in a non-title fight on February 24 in Las Vegas PRIDE 33 was Diaz's first fight in the PRIDE organization and at the weight of 160 lb While Gomi started the fight strongly, once knocking Diaz to the ground, twice ending up in his guard, and opening up cuts around both of Diaz's eyes, the Californian dominated the stand-up battle with his boxing [40] At the end of the first round, apparently due to poor cardio on Gomi's part, the Japanese fighter was clearly stunned, throwing much wilder punches and barely maintaining his defense Early in the second round, the fight was stopped to check a cut suffered under Diaz's eye The second round saw a continuation of wild punches by Gomi, then eventually taking the fight to the ground and leaving himself open to a Gogoplata submission by Diaz and tapping at 1:46 of the round [40] This was the second successful Gogoplata attempt in PRIDE's history (the first performed by future DREAM Lightweight Champion Shinya Aoki on Joachim Hansen less than two months earlier at PRIDE's New Year's event).\n\n\nEliteXC\nDiaz made his debut for EliteXC in Hawaii on September 15, 2007 on Showtime He won a hard-fought split decision over his opponent Mike Aina [45] MMA Weekly reported that Nick Diaz signed a two-year deal with EliteXC and in his next fight, fought K J Noons for the vacant 160 pound title Once the fight began, the two exchanged rather evenly on the feet until Noons dropped Diaz with a well timed right counterpunch Diaz attempted several takedowns, all of which were stuffed by Noons, on one occasion with a swift right knee which opened up a notable gash on Diaz's face, eventually resulting in a loss via doctor stoppage due to multiple cuts on his forehead A disappointed Diaz left the arena immediately and on his way out he flipped off the doctor from the arena entrance and shoved the camera out of his face [46] [47]\n\n\nStrikeforce and DREAM\nDiaz was victorious in DREAM 3, defeating Katsuya Inoue by TKO in the first round [55] With Strikeforce's acquisition of ProElite's assets, CEO Scott Coker had announced that Nick would face off against MMA legend Frank Shamrock at a Catchweight of 179 lb, at their upcoming event, Strikeforce: Shamrock vs Diaz, in Shamrock's hometown of San Jose on April 11, 2009 at the HP Pavilion [56] Nick was successful in the fight, defeating Shamrock via TKO due to strikes in the second round [57] Throughout the fight, Diaz was dominant in all areas using effective positioning on the ground, once mounting Frank in the end of the first round, before finally finishing the fight in the second round with a body shot that crumpled Frank to the mat and follow up punches before referee John McCarthy called a halt to the bout [58] In the interview he stated \"It's hard to hate the guy, he's been doing what I've been wanting to do and saying what I've wanted to say for a long time\" [59]\n\n\nSecond return to UFC\nUFC president Dana White stated that a matchup between Diaz and UFC Welterweight Champion Georges St-Pierre was a possible consideration [76] Diaz and St-Pierre were rumored to be the next coaches for The Ultimate Fighter 14 reality show, but the show debuted on September 21, 2011, with Michael Bisping and Jason Miller as coaches White later confirmed via Twitter that Diaz would face St-Pierre at UFC 137 at the Mandalay Bay Event Center in Las Vegas, Nevada, on October 29, 2011 Nick Diaz vacated his Strikeforce Welterweight Championship title prior to his bout with Georges St-Pierre [77] Dana White made the decision to take Diaz out of the fight and replace him with former WEC Welterweight Champion and future UFC Interim Welterweight Champion Carlos Condit, due to Diaz missing multiple flights for a press event to support the fight [78] It was announced that Diaz would fight B.J Penn in the main event at his original fight card, UFC 137 [79] Diaz won via unanimous decision [80] Diaz called out St-Pierre in the post-fight interview, [81] who was scheduled to fight Condit at the same event but had been forced out of the bout

The show premiered on 3 October 2021 on Star Vijay and was hosted by Kamal Haasan. The season concluded on 20 February 2022.\n\n**Production**\n\nThis season, the logo is pink eye with a pupil that represents blue eyes with small stars, surrounded by a gold outline of the eye. The eye logo represents the theme of the season, which is \"Nature\".\n\n## Eye Logo\n\nThe eye logo is a departure from the previous seasons' logos, which featured a more abstract design. The pink eye represents the natural world, while the blue pupil with small stars represents the beauty and complexity of nature. The gold outline of the eye adds a touch of luxury and sophistication, fitting for a reality show of this caliber.\n\n## Bigg Boss House\n\nThe Bigg Boss house has undergone a significant transformation compared to the last season. The theme of the house has shifted from a modern and sleek aesthetic to a more natural and earthy feel. The walls are adorned with plants and flowers, and the furniture is made from natural materials such as wood and stone. The house is designed to resemble a nature reserve, complete with a mini-garden and a small pond. The changes to the house reflect the theme of the season, which is to bring out the natural beauty of the contestants.\n\n## Teaser\n\nThe teaser for the season was released on 4 September 2021, and it set the tone for the season. The teaser features a paradigm shift in a Tamil wedding scene, which is then co-related with the Bigg Boss house. The teaser is a clever play on the theme of the season, which is to bring out the natural beauty of the contestants. Two more promotional teasers were released in September 2021, featuring different commentaries from Kamal Haasan.\n\n## Audience\n\nThe show was filmed on set for the weekend episodes after the ease of COVID-19 restrictions in Tamil Nadu.

The 5 housemates who manage to steal the medals win a super power to save themselves from eviction in the future and topple captaincy. However, the power can only be used once and is only available until week 10.\n\n**Weekly Summary**\n\nVarun swapped the captaincy using WATER power medal.\n\n**BB Prison**\n\nEach week, housemates who did not perform satisfactorily in the Luxury Budget Task, are sent to the Bigg Boss underground prison. The prison is devoid of any facilities except a bed and a water bucket.\n\n**Guest Appearance**\n\nKamal Haasan made several guest appearances throughout the season.\n\n**Physical Appearances**\n\nKamal Haasan appeared on the show physically throughout the season.\n\n**Nomination Table**\n\nThe nomination table was as follows:\n\n| Week | Nominated | Evicted |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Abishek Raaja, Aari Arjuna | Abishek Raaja |\n| 2 | Ammu Abhirami, Diana Mary Varghese | Ammu Abhirami |\n| 3 | Dhanalakshmi Jayaraman, Gabriella Charlton | Dhanalakshmi Jayaraman |\n| 4 | Jith Felix, Janani Iyer | Jith Felix |\n| 5 | Kiran BH, Lahari | Kiran BH |\n| 6 | Madhumitha, Nishanth | Madhumitha |\n| 7 | Oviya, Raju Jeyaraman | Oviya |\n| 8 | Shanthanu, Suresh Chakravarthy | Shanthanu |\n| 9 | Varun, Velambiri | Varun |\n| 10 | Vijayalakshmi, Yashika Aannand | Vijayalakshmi |\n\n**Notes**\n\nThe season was a huge success and was watched by millions of viewers.

as Monica's mother, Maria Rambeau, from Captain Marvel She also portrays an alternate version of Maria called Binary, [27] [25] [26] appearing in the mid-credits scene alongside Kelsey Grammer as Dr Hank McCoy / Beast Grammer reprises his role from 20th Century Fox's X-Men films X-Men: The Last Stand (2006) and X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014) [25] [26] Leila Farzad and Abraham Popoola portray S.A.B.E.R workers Talia and Dag, respectively, [18] and Daniel Ings portrays Kree scientist Ty-Rone [28] Goose, Carol's pet Flerken who resembles a cat, is played by cats Nemo and Tango, replacing actors Reggie, Archie, Rizzo, and Gonzo from the first film [6]\n\n\nProduction\nAhead of the release of Captain Marvel (2019), star Brie Larson expressed interest in a sequel featuring the character Kamala Khan / Ms Marvel [29] Producer Kevin Feige previously said there were plans to introduce Kamala to the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) following the release of Captain Marvel, because Kamala is inspired by Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel; [30] Iman Vellani was later cast as Kamala for the Disney+ television miniseries Ms Marvel (2022) [31] In March 2019, Feige said Marvel Studios had some \"pretty amazing\" ideas for a sequel, [32] which could either be set in the 1990s, like the first film, or the present day [33] Lashana Lynch expressed interest in reprising her role of Maria Rambeau

sequel, even if it was set in the present [34]\n\n\nPre-production\nPre-production work began by February 2021, when Zawe Ashton was cast as the film's villain [47] By that time, all of the scripts for Ms Marvel had been written so The Marvels creative team was able to read those to know what happens to Kamala in that series [48] Principal photography was expected to begin at the end of May, [49] though some second unit filming began on April 9 in Jersey City, New Jersey, [50] [51] under the working title Goat Rodeo, [50] [52] to capture aerial footage, establishing shots, and green screen plates [50] [53] In May, Marvel Studios revealed that the sequel would be titled The Marvels [54] Ethan Anderton of /Film noted that the title referred to both Captain Marvel and Ms Marvel, since the film's logo included the same stylized \"S\" from the Ms Marvel series' logo [55] Graeme McMillian at The Hollywood Reporter acknowledged this explanation, but also wondered if there was a connection with the 1994 comics series Marvels—which tells various Marvel Universe events from the perspective of a photographer—or with a project of the same name announced in 2020 He also wondered if \"The Marvels\" referred to a family of heroes, much like DC Comics' Marvel Family (now known as the Shazam Family) [56] Later that month, pre-production work began in the United Kingdom [57]\n\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography was expected to begin on May 31, 2021, [49] but began on July 26, 2021, [19] at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire, [19] [49] [62] and at Longcross Studios in Longcross, Surrey, England [19] [65] Sean Bobbitt was the cinematographer [66] Larson confirmed that she had started filming on August 10, [67] and shortly after, Samuel L Jackson revealed that he would reprise his MCU role as Nick Fury, [22] working on it in London at the same time as he was preparing to film Secret Invasion [68] Filming for The Marvels took place in Tropea, Italy, beginning on August 27, including on the coast of the Tyrrhenian Sea [69] [70] On September 3, Park left for Los Angeles to begin filming [71] Shortly after, Saagar Shaikh, Zenobia Shroff and Mohan Kapur were revealed to be reprising their respective roles as Kamala's older brother Aamir, mother Muneeba, and father Yusuf, from Ms Marvel [21] [8] In October 2021, the film's release was delayed to February 17, 2023 [72] Park shot his scenes for two months, and completed filming in England by November 2 [73] Production designer Cara Brower said the film's scale and scope were massive, contrasting her work with DaCosta on Candyman [74] The production created 54 sets at Pinewood and Longcross Studios for five different planets (including Aladna) and spaceships, the S.A.B.E.R space station, Maria Rambeau's house, and the Khan family's house DaCosta wanted each planet to have a distinct design [19] In April 2022, the film's release was moved to July 28, 2023, swapping places with Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, as that film was further along in production [75] [76] Filming of The Marvels wrapped by the middle of the following month [77]\n\n\nPost-production\nJackson revealed in mid-June 2022 that he would return to London in August to work on reshoots for The Marvels, before doing the same for Secret Invasion, [78] and Marvel was preparing for those reshoots by the end of July [79] That month, Larson made a cameo appearance in the last episode of Ms Marvel, \"No Normal\", through footage that DaCosta had filmed for The Marvels DaCosta did not know the footage would be used this way when she filmed it, and its inclusion in Ms Marvel was a surprise to directors Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah as well [80] Filming for The Marvels occurred in early August in Battery Park in New York City to capture visual effects plates [81] DaCosta was revealed in January 2023 to have also worked on the film's script alongside Elissa Karasik and Zeb Wells, who had respectively served as a writer on Loki and the MCU miniseries She-Hulk: Attorney at Law (2022), [82] though only DaCosta, McDonnell, and Karasik were credited [83] In February 2023, the film's release was delayed to November 10, 2023, as Disney and Marvel Studios were re-evaluating their content output and costs [84] This allowed more time for post-production [85] [86] Joanna Robinson of The Ringer reported in April that the film was undergoing a \"massive overhaul\" and reshoots, [87] which took place for four weeks to reportedly make the storyline coherent [86]\n\n\nMusic\nIn January 2022, Laura Karpman was hired to compose the score for the film, after previously doing so for the first season of the MCU television series What If...? (2021) and Ms Marvel [94] [95] DaCosta asked Karpman to write a new theme for the titular team rather than focusing on the individual characters, similar to how The Avengers focused on a team theme rather than individual character themes [96] [97] Karpman described the film's main theme, \"Higher Further Faster Together\", as a chosen family theme that combines elements for Danvers, Rambeau, and Kamala The theme ends with a choir chanting \"higher, further, faster, together\" in Latin Dar-Benn's \"slithery and jazzy\" theme is mainly played on flutes and was inspired by the music of Herbie Hancock [97] John Ottman's X-Men themes from X2 (2003) and X-Men: Days of Future Past are heard during the mid-credits scene [26]\n\n\nMarketing\nLarson, Parris, and Vellani appeared at the 2022 D23 Expo to promote the film and show exclusive footage [102] A teaser trailer, which featured the song \"Intergalactic\" by Beastie Boys, premiered on Good Morning America on April 11, 2023 [103] Edidiong Mboho of Collider felt the teaser \"delivers on the charm and action the MCU is known for\" [104] Charles Pulliam-Moore at The Verge said the trailer showed that Danvers, Rambeau, and Kamala \"are going to end up making quite the team\" and thought the 'place-switching' fight sequences could be the most inventive of the MCU [9] Jackson's appearance in the teaser was considered by some commentators to be a spoiler for the end of Secret Invasion, as it indicated that Fury survives the events of the series despite speculation that the character could die by the end of it [105] [106] Marvel Studios and Bic partnered to create limited-edition pens inspired by the film, as well as the \"Write with Might\" sweepstakes that offered a chance to win a trip to the film's premiere [107] Pita Pit was also partnered with Marvel Studios and Walt Disney Pictures to launch the brand new limited edition smoothie \"Banana Chai\" to promote the film [108] In September 2023, DaCosta expressed concern that she would be promoting the film on her own since the cast were not able to participate in marketing during the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike [109] The strike ultimately did not end until after the film's premiere, which was held in Las Vegas on November 7 without the cast [110] Marvel collaborated with software company Autodesk to display a video of Goose, Danvers's cat-like pet Flerken, on the Sphere through November 13 [111] The strike ended on November 9, and Larson was booked to appear on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon the next day to promote the film [112]\n\n\nRelease\nThe

[116] IMAX Corporation CEO Richard Gelfond said the company would pivot to showing The Marvels in IMAX should Dune: Part Two be delayed by the SAG-AFTRA strike, [116] and this was confirmed in August when the film was moved to March 2024 [114] [117] Before it was set for the November 2023 release date, The Marvels was scheduled for July 8, 2022, [37] November 11, 2022, [54] February 17, 2023, [72]

screen plates [50] [53] In May, Marvel Studios revealed that the sequel would be titled The Marvels [54] Ethan Anderton of /Film noted that the title referred to both Captain Marvel and Ms Marvel, since the film's logo included the same stylized \"S\" from the Ms Marvel series' logo [55] Graeme McMillian at The Hollywood Reporter acknowledged this explanation, but also wondered if there was a connection with the 1994 comics series Marvels—which tells various Marvel Universe events from the perspective of a photographer—or with a project of the same name announced in 2020 He also wondered if \"The Marvels\" referred to a family of heroes, much like DC Comics' Marvel Family (now known as the Shazam Family) [56] Later that month, pre-production work began in the United Kingdom

17, 2023 [72] Park shot his scenes for two months, and completed filming in England by November 2 [73] Production designer Cara Brower said the film's scale and scope were massive, contrasting her

to November 10, 2023, as Disney and Marvel Studios were re-evaluating their content output and costs [84] This allowed more time for post-production [85] [86] Joanna Robinson of The Ringer reported in

Edidiong Mboho of Collider felt the teaser \"delivers on the charm and action the MCU is known for\" [104] Charles Pulliam-Moore at The Verge said the trailer showed that Danvers, Rambeau, and Kamala \"are going to end up making quite the team\" and thought the 'place-switching' fight sequences could be the most inventive of the MCU [9] Jackson's appearance in the teaser was considered by some commentators to be a spoiler for the end of Secret Invasion, as it indicated that Fury survives the events of the series despite speculation that the character could die by the end of it [105] [106] Marvel Studios and Bic partnered to create limited-edition pens inspired by the film, as well as the \"Write with Might\" sweepstakes that offered a chance to win a trip to the film's premiere [107] Pita Pit was also partnered with Marvel Studios and Walt Disney Pictures to launch the brand new limited edition smoothie \"Banana Chai\" to promote the film [108] In September 2023, DaCosta expressed concern that she would be promoting the film on her own since the cast were not able to participate in marketing during the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike [109] The strike ultimately did not end until after

{"title": "A_Christmas_Carol", "content": "\nPlot\nThe book is divided into five chapters, which Dickens titled \"staves\".\n\n\nStave one\nA Christmas Carol opens on a bleak, cold Christmas Eve in London, seven years after the death of Ebenezer Scrooge's business partner, Jacob Marley Scrooge, an ageing miser, dislikes Christmas and refuses a dinner invitation from his nephew Fred He turns away two men seeking a donation to provide food and heating for the poor and only grudgingly allows his overworked, underpaid clerk, Bob Cratchit, Christmas Day off with pay to conform to the social custom.\n\n\nStave two\nThe first spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Past, takes Scrooge to Christmas scenes of Scrooge's boyhood, reminding him of a time when he was more innocent The scenes reveal Scrooge's lonely childhood at boarding school, his relationship with his beloved sister Fan, the long-dead mother of Fred, and a Christmas party hosted by his first employer, Mr Fezziwig, who treated him like a son Scrooge's neglected fiancée Belle is shown ending their relationship, as she realises that he will never love her as much as he loves money Finally, they visit a now-married Belle with her large, happy family on the Christmas Eve that Marley died Scrooge, upset by hearing a description of the man that he has become, demands that the ghost remove him from the house.\n\n\nStave three\nThe second spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Present, takes Scrooge to a joyous market with people buying the makings of Christmas dinner and to celebrations of Christmas in a miner's cottage and in a lighthouse Scrooge and the ghost also visit Fred's Christmas party A major part of this stave is taken up with Bob Cratchit's family feast and introduces his youngest son, Tiny Tim, a happy boy who is seriously ill The spirit informs Scrooge that Tiny Tim will die unless the course of events changes Before disappearing, the spirit shows Scrooge two hideous, emaciated children named Ignorance and Want He tells Scrooge to beware the former above all and mocks Scrooge's concern for their welfare.\n\n\nStave four\nThe third spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, shows Scrooge a Christmas Day in the future The silent ghost reveals scenes involving the death of a disliked man whose funeral is attended by local businessmen only on condition that lunch is provided His charwoman, laundress and the local undertaker steal his possessions to sell to a fence When he asks the spirit to show a single person who feels emotion over his death, he is only given the pleasure of a poor couple who rejoice that his death gives them more time to put their finances in order When Scrooge asks to see tenderness connected with any death, the ghost shows him Bob Cratchit and his family mourning the death of Tiny Tim The ghost then allows Scrooge to see a neglected grave, with a tombstone bearing Scrooge's name Sobbing, Scrooge pledges to change his ways.\n\n\nStave five\nScrooge awakens on Christmas morning a changed man He makes a large donation to the charity he rejected the previous day, anonymously sends a large turkey to the Cratchit home for Christmas dinner and spends the afternoon at Fred's Christmas party The following day he gives Cratchit an increase in pay, and begins to become a father figure to Tiny Tim From then on Scrooge treats everyone with kindness, generosity and compassion, embodying the spirit of Christmas.\n\n\nBackground\nThe writer Charles Dickens was born to a middle-class family which got into financial difficulties as a result of the spendthrift nature of his father John In 1824 John was committed to the Marshalsea, a debtors' prison in Southwark, London Dickens, aged 12, was forced to pawn his collection of books, leave school and work at a dirty and rat-infested shoe-blacking factory The change in circumstances gave him what his biographer, Michael Slater, describes as a \"deep personal and social outrage\", which heavily influenced his writing and outlook [1]\n\n\nLiterary influences\nDickens was not the first author to celebrate the Christmas season in literature [11] Among earlier authors who influenced Dickens was Washington Irving, whose 1819–20 work The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent included four essays on old English Christmas traditions that he experienced while staying at Aston Hall near Birmingham [12] The tales and essays attracted Dickens, and the two authors shared the belief that returning to Christmas traditions might promote a type of social connection that they felt had been lost in the modern world [13]\n\n\nSocial influences\nDickens was touched by the lot of poor children in the middle decades of the 19th century [16] In early 1843 he toured the Cornish tin mines, where he was angered by seeing children working in appalling conditions [17] The suffering he witnessed there was reinforced by a visit to the Field Lane Ragged School, one of several London schools set up for the education of the capital's half-starved, illiterate street children [18]\n\n\nWriting history\nBy mid-1843 Dickens began to suffer from financial problems Sales of Martin Chuzzlewit were falling off, and his wife, Catherine, was pregnant with their fifth child Matters worsened when Chapman & Hall, his publishers, threatened to reduce his monthly income by £50 if sales dropped further [23] He began A Christmas Carol in October 1843 [24] Michael Slater, Dickens's biographer, describes the book as being \"written at white heat\"; it was completed in six weeks, the final pages being written in early December [25] He built much of the work in his head while taking night-time walks of 15 to 20 miles (24 to 32 km) around London [26] Dickens's sister-in-law wrote how he \"wept, and laughed, and wept again, and excited himself in a most extraordinary manner, in composition\" [27] Slater says that A Christmas Carol was\n\n\nCharacters\nThe central character of A Christmas Carol is Ebenezer Scrooge, a miserly London-based businessman, [30] described in the story as \"a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old sinner!\" [31] Kelly writes that Scrooge may have been influenced by Dickens's conflicting feelings for his father, whom he both loved and demonised This psychological conflict may be responsible for the two radically different Scrooges in the tale—one a cold, stingy and greedy semi-recluse, the other a benevolent, sociable man [32] The professor of English literature Robert Douglas-Fairhurst considers that in the opening part of the book covering young Scrooge's lonely and unhappy childhood, and his aspiration for money to avoid poverty \"is something of a self-parody of Dickens's fears about himself\"; the post-transformation parts of the book are how Dickens optimistically sees himself [33]\n\n\nThemes\nThe transformation of Scrooge is central to the story [48] Davis considers Scrooge to be \"a protean figure always in process of reformation\"; [49] Kelly writes that the transformation is reflected in the description of Scrooge, who begins as a two-dimensional character, but who then grows into one who \"possess [es] an emotional depth  [and] a regret for lost opportunities\" [50] Some writers, including the Dickens scholar Grace Moore, consider that there is a Christian theme running through A Christmas Carol, and that the novella should be seen as an allegory of the Christian concept of redemption [51] [n 8] Dickens's biographer, Claire Tomalin, sees the conversion of Scrooge as carrying the Christian message that \"even the worst of sinners may repent and become a good man\" [54] Dickens's attitudes towards organised religion were complex; [n 9] he based his beliefs and principles on the New Testament [53] His statement that Marley \"had no bowels\" is a reference to the \"bowels of compassion\" mentioned in the First Epistle of John, the reason for his eternal damnation [57] [n 10]\n\n\nPublication\nAs the result of the disagreements with Chapman and Hall over the commercial failures of Martin Chuzzlewit, [64] Dickens arranged to pay for the publishing himself, in exchange for a percentage of the profits [33] Production of A Christmas Carol was not without problems The first printing was meant to have festive green endpapers, but they came out a dull olive colour Dickens' publisher Chapman and Hall replaced these with yellow endpapers and reworked the title page in harmonising red and blue shades [65] The final product was bound in red cloth with gilt-edged pages, completed only two days before the publication date of 19 December 1843 [66] Following publication, Dickens arranged for the manuscript to be bound in red Morocco leather and presented as a gift to his solicitor, Thomas Mitton [67] [n 11]\n\n\nReception\nAccording to Douglas-Fairhurst, contemporary reviews of A Christmas Carol \"were almost uniformly kind\" [75] The Illustrated London News described how the story's \"impressive eloquence .. its unfeigned lightness of heart—its playful and sparkling humour .. its gentle spirit of humanity\" all put the reader \"in good humour with ourselves, with each other, with the season and with the author\" [76] The critic from The Athenaeum, the literary magazine, considered it a \"tale to make the reader laugh and cry – to open his hands, and open his heart to charity even toward the uncharitable .. a dainty dish to set before a King.\" [77] William Makepeace Thackeray, writing in Fraser's Magazine, described the book as \"a national benefit and to every man or woman who reads it, a personal kindness The last two people I heard speak of it were women; neither knew the other, or the author, and both said, by way of criticism, 'God bless him!'\" [74]\n\n\nAftermath\nIn January 1844 Parley's Illuminated Library published an unauthorised version of the story in a condensed form which they sold for twopence [n 13] Dickens wrote to his solicitor\n\n\nPerformances and adaptations\nBy 1849 Dickens was engaged with David Copperfield and had neither the time nor the inclination to produce another Christmas book [90] He decided the best way to reach his audience with his \"Carol philosophy\" was by public readings [91] During Christmas 1853 he gave a reading in Birmingham Town Hall to the Industrial and Literary Institute He insisted that tickets be reserved for working-class attendees at quarter-price and the performance was a great success [92] [93] [94] Thereafter, he read the tale in an abbreviated version 127 times, until 1870 (the year of his death), including at his farewell performance [95]\n\n\nLegacy\nThe phrase \"Merry Christmas\" had been around for many years – the earliest known written use was in a letter in 1534 – but Dickens's use of the phrase in A Christmas Carol popularised it among the Victorian public [103] The exclamation \"Bah! Humbug!\" entered popular use in the English language as a retort to anything sentimental or overly festive; [104] the name \"Scrooge\" became used as a designation for a miser and was added to the Oxford English Dictionary as such in 1982 [105]\n\n\nSee also\n Literature portal\n Novels portal\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nBooks\n\n\nOnline resources\n\n\nNewspapers, journals and magazines\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "# A Christmas Carol\n\n## Introduction\n\nA Christmas Carol is a novella written by Charles Dickens, first published in 1843.

He turns away two men seeking a donation to provide food and heating for the poor and only grudgingly allows his overworked, underpaid clerk, Bob Cratchit, Christmas Day off with pay to conform to the social custom.\n\n### Stave Two: The First of the Three Spirits\n\nThe first spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Past, takes Scrooge to Christmas scenes of Scrooge's boyhood, reminding him of a time when he was more innocent. The scenes reveal Scrooge's lonely childhood at boarding school, his relationship with his beloved sister Fan, the long-dead mother of Fred, and a Christmas party hosted by his first employer, Mr Fezziwig, who treated him like a son. Scrooge's neglected fiancée Belle is shown ending their relationship, as she realises that he will never love her as much as he loves money. Finally, they visit a now-married Belle with her large, happy family on the Christmas Eve that Marley died.\n\n### Stave Three: The Second of the Three Spirits\n\nThe second spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Present, takes Scrooge to a joyous market with people buying the makings of Christmas dinner and to celebrations of Christmas in a miner's cottage and in a lighthouse. Scrooge and the ghost also visit Fred's Christmas party. A major part of this stave is taken up with Bob Cratchit's family feast and introduces his youngest son, Tiny Tim, a happy boy who is seriously ill. The spirit informs Scrooge that Tiny Tim will die unless the course of events changes. Before disappearing, the spirit shows Scrooge two hideous, emaciated children named Ignorance and Want. He tells Scrooge to beware the former above all and mocks Scrooge's concern for their welfare.\n\n### Stave Four: The Last of the Three Spirits\n\nThe third spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, shows Scrooge a Christmas Day in the future. The silent ghost reveals scenes involving the death of a disliked man whose funeral is attended by local businessmen only on condition that lunch is provided. His charwoman, laundress, and the local undertaker steal his possessions to sell to a fence. When Scrooge asks the spirit to show a single person who feels emotion over his death, he is only given the pleasure of a poor couple who rejoice that his death gives them more time to put their finances in order. When Scrooge asks to see tenderness connected with any death, the ghost shows him Bob Cratchit and his family mourning the death of Tiny Tim. The ghost then allows Scrooge to see a neglected grave, with a tombstone bearing Scrooge's name. Sobbing, Scrooge pledges to change his ways.\n\n### Stave Five: The End of It\n\nScrooge awakens on Christmas morning a changed man. He makes a large donation to the charity he rejected the previous day, anonymously sends a large turkey to the Cratchit home for Christmas dinner, and spends the afternoon at Fred's Christmas party. The following day he gives Cratchit an increase in pay, and begins to become a father figure to Tiny Tim. From then on Scrooge treats everyone with kindness, generosity, and compassion, embodying the spirit of Christmas.\n\n## Background\n\nCharles Dickens was born to a middle-class family which got into financial difficulties as a result of the spendthrift nature of his father, John. In 1824, John was committed to the Marshalsea, a debtors' prison in Southwark, London. Dickens, aged 12, was forced to pawn his collection of books, leave school, and work at a dirty and rat-infested shoe-blacking factory. The change in circumstances gave him what his biographer, Michael Slater, describes as a \"deep personal and social outrage,\" which heavily influenced his writing and outlook.\n\n## Literary Influences\n\nDickens was not the first author to celebrate the Christmas season in literature. Among earlier authors who influenced Dickens was Washington Irving, whose 1819-20 work, The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent, included four essays on old English Christmas traditions that he experienced while staying at Aston Hall near Birmingham. The tales and essays attracted Dickens, and the two authors shared the belief that returning to Christmas traditions might promote a type of social connection that they felt had been lost in the modern world.\n\n## Social Influences\n\nDickens was touched by the lot of poor children in the middle decades of the 19th century. In early 1843, he toured the Cornish tin mines, where he was angered by seeing children working in appalling conditions. The suffering he witnessed there was reinforced by a visit to the Field Lane Ragged School, one of several London schools set up for the education of the capital's half-starved, illiterate street children.\n\n## Writing History\n\nBy mid-1843, Dickens began to suffer from financial problems. Sales of Martin Chuzzlewit were falling off, and his wife, Catherine, was pregnant with their fifth child. Matters worsened when Chapman & Hall, his publishers, threatened to reduce his monthly income by £50 if sales dropped further. He began A Christmas Carol in October 1843. Michael Slater, Dickens's biographer, describes the book as being \"written at white heat\"; it was completed in six weeks, the final pages being written in early December. He built much of the work in his head while taking night-time walks of 15 to 20 miles around London.\n\n## Characters\n\nThe central character of A Christmas Carol is Ebenezer Scrooge, a miserly London-based businessman, described in the story as \"a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old sinner!\" Kelly writes that Scrooge may have been influenced by Dickens's conflicting feelings for his father, whom he both loved and demonised. This psychological conflict may be responsible for the two radically different Scrooges in the tale—one a cold, stingy, and greedy semi-recluse, the other a benevolent, sociable man.\n\n## Themes\n\nThe transformation of Scrooge is central to the story. Davis considers Scrooge to be \"a protean figure always in process of reformation\"; Kelly writes that the transformation is reflected in the description of Scrooge, who begins as a two-dimensional character but who then grows into one who \"possess[es] an emotional depth and a regret for lost opportunities.\" Some writers, including the Dickens scholar Grace Moore, consider that there is a Christian theme running through A Christmas Carol, and that the novella should be seen as an allegory of the Christian concept of redemption.\n\n## Publication\n\nAs the result of the disagreements with Chapman and Hall over the commercial failures of Martin Chuzzlewit, Dickens arranged to pay for the publishing himself, in exchange for a percentage of the profits. Production of A Christmas Carol was not without problems. The first printing was meant to have festive green endpapers, but they came out a dull olive colour. Dickens's publisher, Chapman and Hall, replaced these with yellow endpapers and reworked the title page in harmonising red and blue shades.\n\n## Reception\n\nAccording to Douglas-Fairhurst, contemporary reviews of A Christmas Carol \"were almost uniformly kind.\" The Illustrated London News described how the story's \"impressive eloquence… its unfeigned lightness of heart—its playful and sparkling humour… its gentle spirit of humanity\" all put the reader \"in good humour with ourselves, with each other, with the season, and with the author.\" The critic from The Athenaeum, the literary magazine, considered it a \"tale to make the reader laugh and cry— to open his hands, and open his heart to charity even toward the uncharitable… a dainty dish to set before a King.\"\n\n## Aftermath\n\nIn January 1844, Parley's Illuminated Library published an unauthorised version of the story in a condensed form, which they sold for twopence. Dickens wrote to his solicitor, \"I consider it a most audacious and ungentlemanly proceeding.\"\n\n## Performances and Adaptations\n\nBy 1849, Dickens was engaged with David Copperfield and had neither the time nor the inclination to produce another Christmas book. He decided the best way to reach his audience with his \"Carol philosophy\" was by public readings. During Christmas 1853, he gave a reading in Birmingham Town Hall to the Industrial and Literary Institute. He insisted that tickets be reserved for working-class attendees at quarter-price, and the performance was a great success.\n\n## Legacy\n\nThe phrase \"Merry Christmas\" had been around for many years – the earliest known written use was in a letter in 1534 – but Dickens's use of the phrase in A Christmas Carol popularised it among the Victorian public. The exclamation \"Bah! Humbug!\" entered popular use in the English language as a retort to anything sentimental or overly festive. The name \"Scrooge\" became used as a designation for a miser, and was added to the Oxford English Dictionary as such in 1982.\n\n## See Also\n\n* Literature portal\n* Novels portal", "prompt": "Write

may be responsible for the two radically different Scrooges in the tale—one a cold, stingy and greedy semi-recluse, the other a benevolent, sociable man [32] The professor of English literature Robert Douglas-Fairhurst considers that in the opening part of the book covering young Scrooge's lonely and unhappy childhood, and his aspiration for money to avoid poverty \"is something of a self-parody of Dickens's fears about himself\"; the post-transformation parts of the book are how Dickens optimistically sees himself [33]\n\n\nThemes\nThe transformation of Scrooge is central to the story [48]

consider that there is a Christian theme running through A Christmas Carol, and that the novella should be seen as an allegory of the Christian concept of redemption [51] [n 8] Dickens's biographer, Claire Tomalin, sees the conversion of Scrooge as carrying the Christian message that \"even the worst of sinners may repent and become a good man\" [54] Dickens's attitudes towards organised religion were complex; [n 9] he based his beliefs and principles on the New Testament [53] His statement that Marley \"had no bowels\" is a reference to the \"bowels of compassion\" mentioned in the First Epistle of John, the reason for his eternal damnation [57] [n 10]\n\n\nPublication\nAs the result of the disagreements with Chapman and Hall over the commercial failures of Martin Chuzzlewit, [64]

Thackeray, writing in Fraser's Magazine, described the book as \"a national benefit and to every man or woman who reads it, a personal kindness The last two people I heard speak of it were women;

Although the film received mixed reviews, critics praised his chemistry with co-star Kristen Stewart.

He was born in 1984 to Gloria Bell and Karl Malone, a notable basketball player who would later become a NBA star. Bell's life and career have been marked by challenges and controversy, including a disputed paternity claim against Malone.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nBell's early life was marked by uncertainty and controversy. His mother, Gloria Bell, was just 13 years old when she gave birth to him. Malone, who was 20 years old at the time, initially denied being the father, but later reached an out-of-court settlement with the Bell family in 1996. The settlement reportedly included a single lump sum payment and no ongoing child support.\n\nBell's family struggled financially, and he was raised in a challenging environment. He has spoken publicly about the difficulties he faced growing up, including poverty and instability. Despite these challenges, Bell has spoken about the importance of his family and the support he received from his mother and others.\n\n**College Career**\n\nBell attended Northwestern State University, where he played football and basketball. He initially red-shirted the basketball season in 2005 and began playing football in the fall of that year. He was placed at defensive end and later moved to left tackle due to injuries on the offensive line. Bell earned second-team All-Louisiana honors in his second season.\n\nBell's experience playing football was limited, having only played organized football for three seasons at the time of his NFL draft. However, he was encouraged by scouts and coaches, who saw potential in his raw skills. Bell's college career was marked by growth and development, and he eventually became a standout player on the Northwestern State team.\n\n**Professional Career**\n\nThe Buffalo Bills drafted Bell in the seventh round of the 2008 NFL draft. The team was encouraged by his raw skills, but saw him as a longer-term project due to his limited experience. Bell was placed on the active roster, rather than being assigned to the practice squad, where he could have been signed away by another team.\n\nConsistent with the team's view of him as a work in progress, Bell was not activated for play in any of the Bills' regular season games in 2008. However, he was a key contributor to the team's practice squad, where he continued to develop his skills and gain experience.\n\n**Buffalo Bills**\n\nBell's time with the Buffalo Bills was marked by growth and development. He continued to work on his skills and gain experience, eventually becoming a key contributor to the team's practice squad. Despite not playing in any regular season games, Bell remained a valuable asset to the team, and his hard work and dedication did not go unnoticed.\n\n**Philadelphia Eagles**\n\nIn 2012, the Philadelphia Eagles signed Bell to a five-year contract worth up to $34.5 million. The first year of the contract was worth $3.25 million, and Bell played in nine games, including five starts. However, he suffered a few injuries, and the Eagles would have been obligated to pay him more than $8 million in 2013 if he had been included on the roster.\n\nAs a result, the Eagles released Bell from his contract on February 6, 2013. The move was seen as a cost-saving measure, and it marked the end of Bell's time with the Eagles.\n\n**Dallas Cowboys**\n\nOn July 21, 2013, Bell was signed by the Dallas Cowboys. However, he was released by the team during the preseason on August 31, 2013. The move was seen as a surprise, and it marked the end of Bell's time with the Cowboys.\n\n**Relationship with Karl Malone**\n\nBell's relationship with Karl Malone has been a subject of controversy. In 1996, the Bell family filed a paternity lawsuit against Malone, claiming that he was the father of Bell's child. Laboratory blood tests reportedly pointed to an over 99% probability that Malone was the father, or a twin brother of Malone.\n\nMalone initially refused to respond to the lawsuit, but eventually reached an out-of-court settlement with the Bell family. The settlement reportedly included a single lump sum payment and no ongoing child support. Malone's attorney later stated that the settlement did not include an official court determination of paternity and that Malone had a lot of brothers.\n\nBell has spoken publicly about the challenges he faced growing up and the difficulties he experienced due to his relationship with Malone.

The family has a rich history and has produced several notable individuals in various fields, including cinema, politics, business, and sports.\n\n**Background**\n\n## Origin\n\nThe Kapoor family is believed to have originated from the Punjab region of India, specifically from the city of Lahore, which was then a part of the Sikh Empire. The family's surname \"Kapoor\" is derived from the Punjabi word \"kappaar,\" which means \" trader\" or \" merchant.\" The family was known for its business acumen and entrepreneurial spirit, and many of its members were successful traders and merchants.\n\n## Migration\n\nIn the mid-19th century, the Kapoor family began to migrate to other parts of India, including the city of Bombay (now Mumbai), which was then a major trading hub. The family's migration was driven by the search for new business opportunities and the desire to escape the turmoil and instability of the Punjab region.\n\n**Kapoor Family Tree**\n\nThe Kapoor family tree is a complex and extensive one, with many branches and sub-branches. The family's patriarch, Amar Chand Kapoor, is considered the founder of the family. He was a successful trader and businessman who married a woman named Bhagwan Devi. The couple had several children, including four sons and three daughters.\n\n## Notable Members\n\nOne of the most notable members of the Kapoor family is Prithviraj Kapoor, who was a renowned Indian actor and the patriarch of the Kapoor family's film industry branch. He was born in 1906 and was known for his versatility and range as an actor. He played a wide range of characters, from romantic leads to villains, and was a favorite of audiences and filmmakers alike.\n\nAnother notable member of the Kapoor family is Raj Kapoor, who was a film director, producer, and actor. He was born in 1924 and was known for his innovative and experimental approach to filmmaking. He directed and produced many films, including the classic \"Awaara,\" which is considered one of the greatest films of all time.\n\n**Photos of Notable Members of the Family**\n\n* Prithviraj Kapoor\n* Raj Kapoor\n* Shammi Kapoor\n* Shashi Kapoor\n* Randhir Kapoor\n* Rishi Kapoor\n* Neetu Singh (née Singh Kapoor)\n* Karisma Kapoor\n* Kareena Kapoor\n\n**Kapoor Family Memorial at Rajbaugh**\n\nThe Kapoor family has a memorial in the city of Rajbaugh, which was a key location in the family's early history.

emotional honesty like few hip-hop artists ever have, barking his way through hits like \"Ruff Ryders' Anthem\" and \"Get at Me Dog\" one moment, and repenting and philosophizing on tracks like \"Slippin'\" the next His was a decidedly anti-commercial approach, but it worked, and it made him the genre's first new superstar in the wake of the killings of Tupac Shakur and the Notorious B.I.G To this day, few have been able to reach the heights he did—he's the only rapper to have his first five studio albums debut at no 1, and he was the first living hip-hop artist to have two projects go platinum in the same year.\" [144]\n\n\nDivine Master of the Unknown\nDivine Master of the Unknown is the final artistic project by rapper DMX, originally titled Heavy Lies the Crown The project was

set to be included in the Astrovault, a lunar time capsule developed by Quantum Aerospace and Space Ark Media, ensuring DMX's legacy is preserved beyond Earth [162] [163]\n\n\nImpact\nDMX had a significant impact on hip hop music and is considered a \"legend\" in the genre [164] [165] [166] [167] He's credited for having \"defined 2000s rap\" [4] and for being \"among the most prolific rappers of his era\" [168] He broke and set numerous records [169] His early work was vastly different from most mainstream hip hop music at the time; while Puff Daddy and other artists of the Bad Boy Records label were at the height of popularity, characterized by their \"big-budget videos, lavish party-throwing, and dancefloor-ready music\", DMX achieved success with a more dark, aggressive, \"rugged\", [169] less \"marketable\" style.\n\n\nDiscography\nGrammy Award\n\n\nAwards and nominations\nGrammy Award\n\n\nFilmography\nFilms\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal

emotional honesty like few hip-hop artists ever have, barking his way through hits like \"Ruff Ryders' Anthem\" and \"Get at Me Dog\" one moment, and repenting and philosophizing on tracks like \"Slippin'\" the next His was a decidedly anti-commercial approach, but it worked, and it made him the genre's first new superstar in the wake of the killings of Tupac Shakur and the Notorious B.I.G To this day, few have been able to reach the heights he did—he's the only rapper to have his first five studio albums debut at no 1, and he was the first living hip-hop artist to have two projects go platinum in the same year.\" [144]\n\n\nDivine Master of the Unknown\nDivine Master of the Unknown is the final artistic project by rapper DMX, originally titled Heavy Lies the Crown The project was developed in collaboration with William Moseley, a longtime friend and entertainment industry professional The project explores themes of life, death, and the unknown, reflecting DMX's deep personal and spiritual contemplations After DMX's passing in April 2021, the project was posthumously completed and renamed to better capture its broader, more universal themes Divine Master of the Unknown is set to be included in the Astrovault, a lunar time capsule developed by Quantum Aerospace and Space Ark Media, ensuring DMX's legacy is preserved beyond Earth [162] [163]\n\n\nImpact\nDMX had a significant impact on hip hop music and is considered a \"legend\" in the genre [164] [165] [166] [167] He's credited for having \"defined 2000s rap\" [4] and for being \"among the most prolific rappers of his era\" [168] He broke and set numerous records [169] His early work was vastly different from most mainstream hip hop music at the time; while Puff Daddy and other artists of the Bad Boy Records label were at the height of popularity, characterized by their \"big-budget videos, lavish party-throwing, and dancefloor-ready music\", DMX achieved success with a more dark, aggressive, \"rugged\", [169] less \"marketable\" style.\n\n\nDiscography\nGrammy Award\n\n\nAwards and nominations\nGrammy Award\n\n\nFilmography\nFilms\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal

He is currently the head coach of the Nebraska Cornhuskers.\n\n**Early Years**\n\nMatt Rhule was born on January 31, 1975, in New York City to parents Dennis and Gloria. When he was a teenager, Rhule's family moved to State College, Pennsylvania, where he played linebacker at State College Area High School. He then walked on at Penn State under head coach Joe Paterno and played for the Nittany Lions for four years. During his time at Penn State, Rhule became a three-time Penn State Scholar-Athlete and a 1997 Academic All-Big Ten honoree.\n\n**Coaching Career**\n\nFollowing the end of his playing career, Rhule was hired as the linebackers coach at Albright College. After one year at Albright, Rhule served as a position coach at Buffalo, UCLA, and Western Carolina before being hired at Temple as a defensive line coach in 2006 under Al Golden. Rhule became the Owls' quarterbacks coach the following year, his first offensive coaching role, and was named offensive coordinator in 2008. When Golden left for Miami in 2010, Rhule interviewed for Temple's vacant head coaching job, which was instead given to Steve Addazio.\n\n**Temple**\n\nWhen Addazio departed for Boston College following the 2012 season, several veteran Owls players voiced their support for Rhule to return. Rhule, an area native who had referred to Temple as a \"dream job,\" was formally hired as the school's twenty-sixth head coach on December 17, 2012. During his six-year tenure at Temple, Rhule led the team to a 41-33 record, including a 2016 AAC Championship and a bowl game victory over Duke.\n\n**Baylor**\n\nWhen Rhule was introduced as Baylor's head coach on December 7, 2016, the program was in a state of significant transition. Longtime head coach Art Briles and his entire staff were fired or resigned as a result of the school's sexual assault scandal. Briles's immediate successor was veteran Jim Grobe, who took over in an interim capacity in 2016, leading Baylor to a 7-6 record and a seventh consecutive bowl appearance. Rhule's hiring was considered something of a surprise, as athletic director Mack Rhoades had stressed the importance of Baylor's head coach having Texas connections; Rhule had never lived or coached in the state. Despite the initial skepticism, Rhule led the Bears to a 11-3 record in 2018, including a Sugar Bowl victory over Georgia.\n\n**Carolina Panthers**\n\nOn January 7, 2020, Rhule signed a seven-year, $62-million contract to become the fifth head coach of the Carolina Panthers, replacing longtime coach Ron Rivera. Panthers owner David Tepper, overseeing his first head coaching hire, referred to Rhule as a \"program builder\" who \"can build an organization for the next thirty or forty years.\" After the 2020 NFL preseason was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Carolina lost Rhule's NFL head coaching debut to Las Vegas 34-30; he earned his first win against the Chargers in Week 3. A five-game midseason losing streak knocked the Panthers out of playoff contention, and they finished 5-11.\n\n**Nebraska**\n\nOn November 26, 2022, Rhule signed an eight-year, $74-million contract to become the 31st head coach of the Nebraska Cornhuskers. Rhule finished his first season as head coach of Nebraska with a 5-7 record, tying his predecessor's highest win total in just his first year. Rhule's Huskers finished the year with a conference record of 3-6, tied for last in the Big Ten West division after losing the final four games of the season.\n\n**Head Coaching Record**\n\nRhule has a combined college and professional head coaching record of 65-36 (.643 winning percentage). He has led his teams to four bowl appearances and one conference championship.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nRhule and his wife Julie have three children: Bryant, Vivienne, and Leona.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Matt_Rhule\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly years\nRhule was born in New York City on January 31, 1975, to parents Dennis and Gloria When he was a teenager, Rhule's family moved to State College, Pennsylvania, where he played linebacker at State College Area High School before walking on at Penn State under head coach Joe Paterno He played for the Nittany Lions for four years and became a three-time Penn State Scholar-Athlete and a 1997 Academic All-Big Ten honoree [3]\n\n\nCoaching career\nFollowing the end of his playing career, Rhule was hired as the linebackers coach at Albright College After one year at Albright, Rhule served as a position coach at Buffalo, UCLA, and Western Carolina before being hired at Temple as a defensive line coach in 2006 under Al Golden Rhule became the Owls' quarterbacks coach the following year, his first offensive coaching role, and was named offensive coordinator in 2008 [3] When Golden left for Miami in 2010, Rhule interviewed for Temple's vacant head coaching job, which was instead given to Steve Addazio [5]\n\n\nEarly coaching career\nFollowing the end of his playing career, Rhule was hired as the linebackers coach at Albright College After one year at Albright, Rhule served as a position coach at Buffalo, UCLA, and Western Carolina before being hired at Temple as a defensive line coach in 2006 under Al Golden Rhule became the Owls' quarterbacks coach the following year, his first offensive coaching role, and was named offensive coordinator in 2008 [3] When Golden left for Miami in 2010, Rhule interviewed for Temple's vacant head coaching job, which was instead given to Steve Addazio [5]\n\n\nTemple\nWhen Addazio departed for Boston College following the 2012 season, several veteran Owls players voiced their support for Rhule to return [5] Rhule, an area native who had referred to Temple as a \"dream job,\" was formally hired as the school's twenty-sixth head coach on December 17, 2012 [5] [6]\n\n\nBaylor\nWhen Rhule was introduced as Baylor's head coach on December 7, 2016, the program was in a state of significant transition [11] Longtime head coach Art Briles and his entire staff were fired or resigned as a result of the school's sexual assault scandal [12] Briles's immediate successor was veteran Jim Grobe, who took over in an interim capacity in 2016, leading Baylor to a 7–6 record and a seventh consecutive bowl appearance Though generally well-received, [13] Rhule's hire was considered something of a surprise, as athletic director Mack Rhoades had stressed the importance of Baylor's head coach having Texas connections; Rhule had never lived or coached in the state [14]\n\n\nCarolina Panthers\nOn January 7, 2020, Rhule signed a seven-year, $62-million contract to become the fifth head coach of the Carolina Panthers, replacing longtime coach Ron Rivera [20] Panthers owner David Tepper, overseeing his first head coaching hire, referred to Rhule as a \"program builder\" who \"can build an organization for the next thirty or forty years.\" [21] After the 2020 NFL preseason was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Carolina lost Rhule's NFL head coaching debut to Las Vegas 34–30; [22] he earned his first win against the Chargers in Week 3 [23] A five-game midseason losing streak knocked the Panthers out of playoff contention, and they finished 5–11.\n\n\nNebraska\nOn November 26, 2022, Rhule signed an eight-year, $74-million contract to become the 31st head coach of the Nebraska Cornhuskers [27] Rhule finished his first season as head coach of Nebraska with a 5–7 record, tying his predecessor's highest win total in just his first year [28] Rhule's Huskers finished the year with a conference record of 3–6, tied for last in the Big Ten West division after losing the final four games of the season [29]\n\n\nHead coaching record\nRhule and his wife Julie have three children: Bryant, Vivienne, and Leona [30]\n\n\nCollege\nRhule and his wife Julie have three children: Bryant, Vivienne, and Leona [30]\n\n\nNFL\nRhule and his wife Julie have three children: Bryant, Vivienne, and Leona [30]\n\n\nPersonal life\nRhule and his wife Julie have three children: Bryant, Vivienne, and Leona [30]\n\n\nReferences\n# denotes interim head coach\n\n\nExternal links\n# denotes interim head coach\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
