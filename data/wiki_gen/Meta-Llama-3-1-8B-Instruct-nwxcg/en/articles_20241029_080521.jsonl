The outbreak was characterized by a series of intense tornadoes that caused significant damage and loss of life.\n\n**Meteorological Synopsis**\n\nThe outbreak was associated with a potent low-pressure system that developed over the southern Great Plains on March 5. This system was fueled by a strong jet stream and a mass of warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico. As the system moved northward, it interacted with a cold front that was moving southward from Canada, resulting in a complex weather pattern that spawned numerous tornadoes.\n\n**March 5**\n\nOn March 5, a strong low-pressure system was located over the southern Great Plains, with a cold front extending from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. A line of thunderstorms developed along the cold front, with the leading edge of the line producing a series of tornadoes. The first tornado of the outbreak occurred at 4:00 PM CST (21:00 UTC) near the town of Haxtun, Colorado, where an EF1 tornado caused minor damage to several homes and businesses.\n\nAs the low-pressure system continued to strengthen, the line of thunderstorms intensified, producing multiple tornadoes across eastern Colorado and western Kansas. A series of EF2 tornadoes touched down in the area, causing significant damage to homes and businesses, and injuring several people.\n\n**March 6–7**\n\nOn March 6, the low-pressure system continued to move northward, bringing a strong cold front with it. A line of thunderstorms developed along the cold front, producing a series of intense tornadoes across the Midwest and Great Plains. The tornadoes were fueled by a strong jet stream and a mass of warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico, resulting in some of the most intense tornadoes of the outbreak.\n\nOn March 7, the low-pressure system continued to move northward, bringing a strong cold front with it. A line of thunderstorms developed along the cold front, producing a series of intense tornadoes across the Great Lakes region. The tornadoes were fueled by a strong jet stream and a mass of warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico, resulting in some of the most intense tornadoes of the outbreak.\n\n**Confirmed Tornadoes**\n\nA total of 53 tornadoes were confirmed across the United States during the outbreak, with the majority occurring on March 6 and 7. The tornadoes ranged in intensity from EF0 to EF4, with several EF3 and EF4 tornadoes reported across the Midwest and Great Plains.\n\n**March 5 Event**\n\nOn March 5, a total of 13 tornadoes were confirmed, with the majority occurring in eastern Colorado and western Kansas. The tornadoes were fueled by a strong low-pressure system that developed over the southern Great Plains, resulting in some of the most intense tornadoes of the outbreak.\n\n**March 6 Event**\n\nOn March 6, a total of 23 tornadoes were confirmed, with the majority occurring in the Midwest and Great Plains. The tornadoes were fueled by a strong low-pressure system that developed over the southern Great Plains, resulting in some of the most intense tornadoes of the outbreak.\n\n**March 7 Event**\n\nOn March 7, a total of 17 tornadoes were confirmed, with the majority occurring in the Great Lakes region. The tornadoes were fueled by a strong low-pressure system that developed over the southern Great Plains, resulting in some of the most intense tornadoes of the outbreak.\n\n**Macksburg–Winterset–Norwalk–Colfax–Newton, Iowa**\n\nOn March 7, a devastating EF4 tornado touched down in the town of Macksburg, Iowa, causing widespread destruction and loss of life. The tornado traveled a total distance of 43 miles, causing significant damage to homes, businesses, and infrastructure. A total of 9 people were killed and over 100 injured in the tornado.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe tornado outbreak of March 5–7, 2022, resulted in significant damage and loss of life across the United States. A total of 53 tornadoes were confirmed, with several EF3 and EF4 tornadoes reported across the Midwest and Great Plains. The outbreak was fueled by a potent low-pressure system that developed over the southern Great Plains, resulting in some of the most intense tornadoes of the year.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* List of tornado outbreaks in the United States\n* Tornadoes of 2022\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The tornado outbreak of March 5–7, 2022, was one of the most significant tornado outbreaks of the year in the United States.\n* The outbreak resulted in significant damage and loss of life across the Midwest and Great Plains.\n* The tornadoes were fueled by a potent low-pressure system that developed over the southern Great Plains.\n\n**References**\n\n* None\n\n**External Links**\n\n* National Weather Service: Tornado Outbreak of March 5–7, 2022\n* Storm Prediction Center: Tornado Outbreak of March 5–7, 2022", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Tornado_outbreak_of_March_5–7,_2022\" following this outline:\n\n#Meteorological synopsis\n##March 5\n##March 6–7\n#Confirmed tornadoes\n##March 5 event\n##March 6 event\n##March 7 event\n##Macksburg–Winterset–Norwalk–Colfax–Newton, Iowa\n#Aftermath\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He was a prominent figure in the history of philosophy, and his ideas had a profound impact on the development of Western philosophy, particularly in the areas of metaphysics, epistemology, and the nature of the self.\n\n**Biography**\n\nPlotinus was born in Lycopolis, Egypt around 205 AD. His family was of Greek descent, and he received a traditional Greek education in philosophy, literature, and mathematics. At the age of 28, he traveled to Alexandria, where he studied under the direction of the philosopher Ammonius Saccas. This period of study had a profound impact on Plotinus, and he later described it as a period of spiritual awakening.\n\n### Expedition to Persia and return to Rome\n\nIn 243 AD, Plotinus joined the army of the Roman Emperor Gordian III on an expedition to Persia. The expedition was a disaster, and Plotinus was forced to flee from the battlefield. He eventually made his way back to Rome, where he began to teach philosophy.\n\n### Later life\n\nPlotinus settled in Rome and established a school of philosophy, which attracted many students, including the young Porphyry. He taught his students the principles of Neoplatonism, which emphasized the importance of the One, the nature of the soul, and the path to enlightenment. Plotinus's teachings were not written down during his lifetime, and it was not until after his death that his student Porphyry compiled and edited his teachings into a series of texts, known as the Enneads.\n\n**Major ideas**\n\nPlotinus's philosophy is centered around the concept of the One, which he believed to be the ultimate reality. He saw the world as a series of emanations from the One, with each stage of the emanation becoming more and more distant from the source.\n\n### The One\n\nThe One is the ultimate reality, the source of all things. It is beyond human comprehension and can only be experienced through intuition and contemplation. The One is not a being, but rather a state of being, and it is the source of all existence.\n\n### Emanation by the One\n\nPlotinus believed that the universe was created through a process of emanation, with each stage of the emanation becoming more and more distant from the source. The first stage of emanation is the Nous, or the realm of intellect, which contains the ideas of all things. The second stage is the World Soul, which gives life and energy to the universe. The third stage is the material world, which is the realm of space and time.\n\n### The true human and happiness\n\nPlotinus believed that the true human is one who has achieved spiritual enlightenment and has become aware of the One. This individual has transcended the limitations of the material world and has achieved a state of happiness and fulfillment. Happiness is not a pleasure or a sensual experience, but rather a state of being that arises from the contemplation of the One.\n\n### Henosis\n\nHenosis is the process of reunification with the One, which is the ultimate goal of Plotinus's philosophy. It is a state of spiritual awakening, where the individual transcends the limitations of the material world and becomes one with the source. Henosis is not a destination, but rather a process that requires dedication and discipline.\n\n**Relation with contemporary philosophy and religion**\n\nPlotinus's philosophy was influenced by the ideas of Plato, and he saw himself as a continuation of the Platonic tradition. However, he also drew on other sources, including Stoicism and Aristotelianism. Plotinus's philosophy was also influenced by the mystical and spiritual traditions of the time, and he saw his teachings as a way of achieving spiritual enlightenment.\n\n### Plotinus's Relation to Plato\n\nPlotinus saw himself as a continuation of the Platonic tradition, and he believed that his teachings were a development of Plato's ideas. He was particularly interested in Plato's concept of the Forms, and he saw the One as the ultimate reality that underlies all of existence.\n\n### Plotinus and the Gnostics\n\nPlotinus was influenced by the Gnostic traditions of the time, and he shared many of their ideas about the nature of the material world and the path to enlightenment. However, he also rejected many of the Gnostic ideas, particularly their emphasis on the importance of knowledge as a means of achieving salvation.\n\n### Against causal astrology\n\nPlotinus rejected the idea of causal astrology, which held that the movements of the stars and planets could influence human affairs. He believed that human beings have free will and are responsible for their own actions.\n\n**Film studies**\n\nThere have been several films and documentaries made about Plotinus and his philosophy, including \"The Plotinus Enigma\" (2011) and \"The One: A Film About Plotinus\" (2004). These films offer a visual representation of Plotinus's ideas and provide an introduction to his philosophy for a wider audience.\n\n**Influence**\n\nPlotinus's ideas have had a profound impact on the development of Western philosophy, particularly in the areas of metaphysics, epistemology, and the nature of the self. His concepts of the One, emanation, and henosis have influenced many philosophers, including the Neoplatonists, the Gnostics, and the Medieval Scholastics.\n\n### Ancient world\n\nPlotinus's ideas were influential in the ancient world, particularly in the areas of philosophy and spirituality. His concepts of the One and emanation were influential in the development of Neoplatonism, and his ideas about the nature of the self were influential in the development of Gnosticism.\n\n### Christianity\n\nPlotinus's ideas about the nature of the self and the path to enlightenment were influential in the development of Christian mysticism. His concept of the One was seen as a symbol of the divine, and his ideas about emanation and henosis were seen as a way of understanding the nature of God.\n\n### Islam\n\nPlotinus's ideas were also influential in the development of Islamic philosophy, particularly in the areas of metaphysics and epistemology. His concepts of the One and emanation were influential in the development of Sufism, and his ideas about the nature of the self were influential in the development of Islamic mysticism.\n\n### Judaism\n\nPlotinus's ideas about the nature of the self and the path to enlightenment were also influential in the development of Jewish mysticism. His concept of the One was seen as a symbol of the divine, and his ideas about emanation and henosis were seen as a way of understanding the nature of God.\n\n### Renaissance\n\nPlotinus's ideas were influential in the Renaissance, particularly in the areas of philosophy and art. His concepts of the One and emanation were influential in the development of Neoplatonism, and his ideas about the nature of the self were influential in the development of Renaissance humanism.\n\n### Great Britain\n\nPlotinus's ideas were also influential in Great Britain, particularly in the areas of philosophy and literature. His concepts of the One and emanation were influential in the development of Romanticism, and his ideas about the nature of the self were influential in the development of British idealism.\n\n### India\n\nPlotinus's ideas were also influential in India, particularly in the areas of philosophy and spirituality. His concepts of the One and emanation were influential in the development of Advaita Vedanta, and his ideas about the nature of the self were influential in the development of Indian mysticism.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Neoplatonism\n* Gnosticism\n* Stoicism\n* Aristotelianism\n* Medieval Scholasticism\n* Renaissance humanism\n* Romanticism\n* British idealism\n* Advaita Vedanta\n* Indian mysticism\n\n**Notes**\n\n* Plotinus's teachings were not written down during his lifetime, and it was not until after his death that his student Porphyry compiled and edited his teachings into a series of texts, known as the Enneads.\n* Plotinus's ideas were influential in the development of Western philosophy, particularly in the areas of metaphysics, epistemology, and the nature of the self.\n* Plotinus's concept of the One was seen as a symbol of the divine, and his ideas about emanation and henosis were seen as a way of understanding the nature of God.\n* Plotinus's ideas were influential in the development of Christian mysticism, Islamic philosophy, and Jewish mysticism.\n\n**References**\n\n* Porphyry. \"Life of Plotinus\"\n* Plotinus. \"The Enneads\"\n* Plotinus. \"The Letters\"\n* Plotinus. \"The Treatises\"\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n* Armstrong, A.

The floods were caused by a combination of heavy monsoon rains and glacier lake outburst floods (GLOFs) in the north of the country.\n\n**Background**\n\nPakistan is a country prone to natural disasters, particularly floods, due to its geography and climate. The country's mountainous regions, including the Himalayas and the Karakoram, receive heavy monsoon rainfall every year, which can lead to flash flooding in the low-lying areas. Additionally, the country has a number of glaciers, particularly in the north, which can burst and cause GLOFs, leading to massive floods downstream.\n\nIn 2022, Pakistan experienced a particularly severe monsoon season, with heavy rainfall recorded across the country. The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) reported that the monsoon rains were 40% above average, with some areas receiving as much as 300% more rainfall than usual. The heavy rainfall led to flash flooding in the low-lying areas, while the GLOFs in the north caused widespread destruction and loss of life.\n\n**Impact**\n\nThe 2022 Pakistan floods had a significant impact on the country, particularly in the provinces of Sindh, Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Gilgit-Baltistan, Punjab, and Azad Kashmir.\n\n### Sindh\n\nSindh was one of the worst-affected provinces, with heavy rainfall and GLOFs causing widespread destruction and loss of life. The province's major cities, including Karachi and Hyderabad, were inundated with floodwaters, while the rural areas were left without access to basic necessities like food, water, and shelter. The Sindh government estimated that the floods affected over 1 million people in the province, with over 100,000 homes destroyed.\n\n### Balochistan\n\nBalochistan was another province severely affected by the floods, with heavy rainfall and GLOFs causing widespread destruction and loss of life. The province's remote and inaccessible areas were particularly affected, with many villages left without access to basic necessities like food, water, and shelter. The Balochistan government estimated that the floods affected over 500,000 people in the province, with over 30,000 homes destroyed.\n\n### Khyber Pakhtunkhwa\n\nKhyber Pakhtunkhwa was also severely affected by the floods, with heavy rainfall and GLOFs causing widespread destruction and loss of life. The province's major cities, including Peshawar and Mardan, were inundated with floodwaters, while the rural areas were left without access to basic necessities like food, water, and shelter. The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government estimated that the floods affected over 200,000 people in the province, with over 10,000 homes destroyed.\n\n### Gilgit-Baltistan\n\nGilgit-Baltistan was one of the most affected regions, with heavy rainfall and GLOFs causing widespread destruction and loss of life. The region's remote and inaccessible areas were particularly affected, with many villages left without access to basic necessities like food, water, and shelter. The Gilgit-Baltistan government estimated that the floods affected over 100,000 people in the region, with over 5,000 homes destroyed.\n\n### Punjab\n\nPunjab was also affected by the floods, with heavy rainfall and GLOFs causing widespread destruction and loss of life. The province's major cities, including Lahore and Faisalabad, were inundated with floodwaters, while the rural areas were left without access to basic necessities like food, water, and shelter. The Punjab government estimated that the floods affected over 500,000 people in the province, with over 20,000 homes destroyed.\n\n### Azad Kashmir\n\nAzad Kashmir was another region severely affected by the floods, with heavy rainfall and GLOFs causing widespread destruction and loss of life. The region's remote and inaccessible areas were particularly affected, with many villages left without access to basic necessities like food, water, and shelter. The Azad Kashmir government estimated that the floods affected over 200,000 people in the region, with over 10,000 homes destroyed.\n\n**Response**\n\nThe response to the 2022 Pakistan floods was led by the national government, with support from international organizations, countries, corporate sector, and private individuals.\n\n### National\n\nThe national government established a flood relief and rehabilitation committee, which was responsible for coordinating the relief efforts. The committee was headed by the Prime Minister of Pakistan, who also visited the affected areas to oversee the relief efforts. The government also established a flood relief fund, which was used to provide assistance to the affected people.\n\n### International\n\nThe international community responded to the floods with significant assistance. The United Nations (UN) and its agencies, including the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), provided significant assistance to the affected people. The World Food Programme (WFP) and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) also provided significant assistance to the affected people.\n\n### Countries\n\nSeveral countries provided significant assistance to Pakistan in response to the floods. The United States provided $100 million in assistance, while the United Kingdom provided £40 million. China provided significant assistance, including food, medicine, and shelter. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates also provided significant assistance.\n\n### Corporate Sector\n\nThe corporate sector also responded to the floods with significant assistance. The Pakistani business community provided significant assistance, including food, medicine, and shelter. The international corporate sector also provided significant assistance, including the provision of resources and expertise.\n\n### Private Individuals\n\nPrivate individuals also responded to the floods with significant assistance. The Pakistani diaspora community provided significant assistance, including the provision of food, medicine, and shelter. Individuals and organizations from around the world also provided significant assistance.\n\n**Army helicopter crash**\n\nOn July 15, 2022, a Pakistani army helicopter crashed in the Skardu district of Gilgit-Baltistan, killing all 18 people on board. The helicopter was on a relief mission to provide assistance to the affected people. The crash was a significant setback to the relief efforts, but it did not deter the government and the people from continuing their efforts to provide assistance to the affected people.\n\n**See also**\n\n* 2010 Pakistan floods\n* 2013 Pakistan floods\n* 2014 Pakistan floods\n* 2015 Pakistan floods\n* 2017 Pakistan floods\n\n**References**\n\n(Note: No references are cited in this article)\n\n**External links**\n\n* Government of Pakistan: Flood Relief and Rehabilitation Committee\n* Pakistan Meteorological Department: Monsoon Season 2022\n* United Nations: Pakistan Floods 2022\n* World Food Programme: Pakistan Floods 2022\n* International Committee of the Red Cross: Pakistan Floods 2022", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Pakistan_floods\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Impact\n##Sindh\n##Balochistan\n##Khyber Pakhtunkhwa\n##Gilgit-Baltistan\n##Punjab\n##Azad Kashmir\n#Response\n##National\n##International\n###International Organizations\n###Countries\n###Corporate Sector\n###Private Individuals\n#Army helicopter crash\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The WGA strike, which began on May 2, 2023, caused many television shows to go on hiatus or be delayed. The strike affected several networks, including ABC, CBS, The CW, Fox, and NBC, which had to adjust their programming schedules accordingly.\n\nThe SAG-AFTRA strike, which began on July 14, 2023, further exacerbated the situation, as many shows that had already been delayed due to the WGA strike were forced to suspend production once again. The strikes had a significant impact on the television industry, with many shows facing delays, cancellations, or changes to their production schedules.\n\n# Legend\n\n*   New series\n*   Renewed

It is a symbol of the Mauryan Empire and is considered one of the most iconic and enduring representations of Indian art and culture.\n\n**History**\n\nThe Lion Capital of Ashoka is believed to have been created around 250 BCE, during the reign of Ashoka, who ruled the Mauryan Empire from 269 BCE to 232 BCE. Ashoka, who initially was a ruthless and expansionist ruler, later converted to Buddhism and became a patron of the Buddhist faith. The Lion Capital is thought to have been created as a symbol of Ashoka's conversion and his commitment to Buddhism.\n\nThe Lion Capital is believed to have been originally placed at the top of the Ashoka Pillar at Sarnath, a site near Varanasi in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. The pillar, which is now known as the Ashoka Pillar of Sarnath, is a 10.6-meter-tall sandstone column that was erected by Ashoka to commemorate his conversion to Buddhism.\n\n**Excavation and display**\n\nThe Lion Capital was first excavated in 1904 by a team of British archaeologists led by General Sir John Marshall. The team discovered the capital at the base of the Ashoka Pillar, which had been damaged and toppled over. The capital was carefully excavated and reconstructed, and it has since been displayed at the Sarnath Museum in Varanasi.\n\nIn 2004, the Lion Capital was moved to the National Museum in New Delhi, where it is displayed as a national treasure. The capital is now protected by a climate-controlled environment, and it is viewed by millions of visitors each year.\n\n**Description**\n\nThe Lion Capital is a magnificent sculpture that measures 3.2 meters in height and 1.9 meters in width. It is carved from a single block of sandstone and weighs over 4 tons. The capital is divided into four parts: the base, the shaft, the capital, and the crowning lion.\n\nThe base of the capital is a circular disc, which is adorned with intricate carvings of foliage and other motifs. The shaft of the capital is a slender column, which is adorned with a series of lotus flowers and other Buddhist motifs.\n\nThe capital is a circular disc, which is adorned with a series of intricate carvings of foliage and other motifs. The center of the capital is dominated by a majestic lion, which is seated on a throne and surrounded by a halo of foliage.\n\n**Symbolism**\n\nThe Lion Capital is a symbol of the Mauryan Empire and is considered one of the most iconic and enduring representations of Indian art and culture. The capital is also a symbol of Ashoka's conversion to Buddhism and his commitment to the Buddhist faith.\n\nThe lion, which is the central figure of the capital, is a symbol of courage and strength. The throne, on which the lion is seated, is a symbol of power and authority. The foliage, which surrounds the lion, is a symbol of life and vitality.\n\nThe capital is also a symbol of the Mauryan Empire's cultural and artistic achievements. The intricate carvings and other motifs that adorn the capital are a testament to the skill and craftsmanship of the Mauryan artisans.\n\n**Influences**\n\nThe Lion Capital has had a significant influence on Indian art and culture. The capital has inspired countless other sculptures and artworks, and it continues to be a source of inspiration for artists and designers today.\n\nThe capital has also had a significant influence on Buddhism and Buddhist art. The lion, which is the central figure of the capital, is a symbol of courage and strength, and it is often used in Buddhist art to represent the Buddha himself.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nThe Lion Capital of Ashoka is a testament to the enduring legacy of the Mauryan Empire and its cultural and artistic achievements. The capital is a symbol of India's rich cultural heritage, and it continues to be a source of pride and inspiration for Indians around the world.\n\nThe capital is also a reminder of the importance of preserving our cultural and artistic heritage.

The election was the 11th Legislative Assembly election in the state since its formation in 1972.\n\nBackground\n\n### TTAADC Elections\n\nThe Tripura Tribal Areas Autonomous District Council (TTAADC) elections were held in 2018, which saw the Tipra Motha Party (TMP) emerge as the single largest party with 18 seats in the 30-member council. However, the BJP-TTAADC alliance managed to form the government, with the BJP's winning candidate, Subal Bhowmik, becoming the chairman of the council.\n\n### Major Political Defections\n\nIn the run-up to the 2023 election, several major defections took place in the state's politics. On January 21, 2023, the TMP's leader, Pradyot Kishore Debbarma, announced that the party would contest the election as an ally of the Opposition parties. However, on February 2, 2023, Debbarma announced that the TMP would contest the election independently. This move led to a split in the TMP, with several of its MLAs joining the BJP.\n\nSchedule\n\nThe election was scheduled to be held in two phases, with 59 constituencies going to polls on February 16, 2023, and the remaining 18 constituencies on February 18, 2023.\n\nParties and Alliances\n\n### National Democratic Alliance\n\nThe National Democratic Alliance (NDA) was the ruling coalition in the state, with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as its main constituent. The BJP had formed an alliance with the Indigenous People's Front of Tripura (IPFT) and the Tipra Motha Party. However, the IPFT had withdrawn its support to the BJP in January 2023, and the TMP had announced its decision to contest the election independently.\n\n### Secular Democratic Forces\n\nThe Secular Democratic Forces (SDF) was an alliance of opposition parties in the state, including the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI(M)), the Communist Party of India (CPI), the Indian National Congress (INC), and the Tipra Motha Party. However, the TMP had announced its decision to contest the election independently, leading to a split in the SDF.\n\n### Tipra Motha Party\n\nThe Tipra Motha Party (TMP) was founded by Pradyot Kishore Debbarma, a member of the royal family of Tripura, in 2019. The party had emerged as the single largest party in the TTAADC elections in 2018, with 18 seats in the 30-member council. However, the party had split in the run-up to the 2023 election, with several of its MLAs joining the BJP.\n\n### Others\n\nOther parties participating in the election included the Indigenous People's Front of Tripura (IPFT), the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Liberation (CPI(ML)L), and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).\n\nCandidates\n\nA total of 292 candidates were in the fray in the 2023 Tripura Legislative Assembly election, including 15 women.\n\nIssues\n\n### 10323 Teachers Batch\n\nOne of the major issues in the election was the 10323 Teachers Batch, which had been recruited by the Tripura government in 2013. The batch had been on strike since 2017, demanding regularization of their services. The BJP had promised to regularize the services of the batch in its election manifesto.\n\n### Tipraland Movement\n\nThe Tipraland Movement was another major issue in the election. The movement had been demanding a separate state for the Tripuri people, who are the indigenous people of Tripura. The BJP had promised to consider the demand for a separate state in its election manifesto.\n\n### Bru Refugees\n\nThe issue of Bru refugees had also been a major issue in the election. The Bru people had been forced to flee their homes in Mizoram due to ethnic violence in 1997. The Tripura government had been providing shelter and relief to the Bru refugees, but the issue had been a major point of contention in the election.\n\nCampaigns\n\n### Bharatiya Janata Party\n\nThe Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had launched a massive campaign in the run-up to the election, highlighting its achievements in the state since it came to power in 2018. The party had also promised to regularize the services of the 10323 Teachers Batch, consider the demand for a separate state for the Tripuri people, and provide relief to the Bru refugees.\n\n### Communist Party of India (Marxist)\n\nThe Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI(M)) had also launched a campaign in the run-up to the election, highlighting its achievements in the state since it came to power in 1972. The party had also promised to improve the living conditions of the people, provide employment opportunities, and provide relief to the Bru refugees.\n\n### Indian National Congress\n\nThe Indian National Congress (INC) had also launched a campaign in the run-up to the election, highlighting its achievements in the state since it came to power in 1972. The party had also promised to improve the living conditions of the people, provide employment opportunities, and provide relief to the Bru refugees.\n\n### Tipra Motha Party\n\nThe Tipra Motha Party (TMP) had also launched a campaign in the run-up to the election, highlighting its achievements in the TTAADC elections in 2018. The party had also promised to consider the demand for a separate state for the Tripuri people and provide relief to the Bru refugees.\n\nIncidents\n\nSeveral incidents were reported in the run-up to the election, including the murder of a BJP worker and the clash between the supporters of the BJP and the TMP.\n\nSurveys & Polls\n\nSeveral surveys and polls were conducted in the run-up to the election, including a survey by the CNN-News18 and a poll by the ABP News. The surveys and polls had predicted a close contest between the BJP and the SDF.\n\nResults\n\n### Results by Alliance and Party\n\nThe results of the election were as follows:\n\n* Bharatiya Janata

The mission aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique in changing the trajectory of a near-Earth asteroid (NEA) and potentially provide a method for preventing asteroid impacts in the future.\n\n**Mission History**\n\nThe DART mission was first proposed in 2015 as a part of NASA's Planetary Defense Coordination Office (PDCO) efforts to develop strategies for preventing asteroid impacts. The mission was selected for funding in 2015 and was initially planned to launch in 2022. However, due to technical and logistical issues, the launch was delayed until November 2021.\n\n**Description**\n\nThe DART spacecraft is a collaborative effort between NASA and its international partners, including the Italian Space Agency (ASI) and the University of Maryland. The mission consists of two primary components: the DART spacecraft and a secondary spacecraft called LICIACube, developed by ASI.\n\n**Spacecraft**\n\nThe DART spacecraft is a 585-kilogram (1,292-pound) spacecraft designed to travel to the asteroid Didymos, a small binary asteroid system consisting of a 780-meter (2,560-foot) diameter primary asteroid and a 170-meter (560-foot) diameter secondary asteroid called Dimorphos. The spacecraft is equipped with a range of scientific instruments, including cameras, solar arrays, an antenna, and an ion thruster.\n\n### Camera\n\nThe DART spacecraft is equipped with a high-resolution camera system designed to capture detailed images of the asteroid system before and after the impact. The camera system consists of a primary camera and a secondary camera, both of which are capable of capturing images at a resolution of up to 0.5 meters (1.6 feet) per pixel.\n\n### Solar Arrays\n\nThe DART spacecraft is equipped with two solar arrays that provide power to the spacecraft's instruments and systems. The solar arrays are designed to provide a peak power of 250 watts and are capable of charging the spacecraft's batteries during periods of low sunlight.\n\n### Antenna\n\nThe DART spacecraft is equipped with a high-gain antenna that provides communication with Earth. The antenna is designed to transmit data at a rate of up to 2 kbps and is capable of receiving commands from Earth.\n\n### Ion Thruster\n\nThe DART spacecraft is equipped with an ion thruster that provides attitude control and propulsion. The thruster is designed to provide a maximum thrust of 22 millinewtons and is capable of operating in a variety of modes, including continuous thrust and pulse mode.\n\n**Secondary Spacecraft**\n\nThe LICIACube spacecraft is a small secondary spacecraft developed by ASI that was launched alongside the DART spacecraft. The LICIACube spacecraft is designed to travel to the asteroid system after the impact and capture images of the crater created by the impact.\n\n**Effect of the Impact on Dimorphos and Didymos**\n\nThe impact of the DART spacecraft on Dimorphos is expected to change the asteroid's orbit and potentially create a crater on its surface. The impact is designed to be small enough to not significantly alter the overall orbit of the asteroid system, but large enough to demonstrate the effectiveness of the kinetic impactor technique.\n\n**Observations of the Impact**\n\nThe impact of the DART spacecraft on Dimorphos is expected to be observed by a range of scientific instruments, including the DART spacecraft's cameras and the LICIACube spacecraft's camera. The impact will also be observed by ground-based telescopes and other spacecraft in orbit around the Earth.\n\n**Follow-up Mission**\n\nThe DART mission is designed to be followed up with a second mission, known as the AIDA (Asteroid Impact and Deflection Assessment) mission, which will include a European Space Agency (ESA) spacecraft called Hera. The Hera spacecraft will travel to the asteroid system after the impact and provide a detailed survey of the crater created by the impact.\n\n**AIDA Mission Architecture**\n\nThe AIDA mission architecture consists of two primary components: the Hera spacecraft and the DART spacecraft. The Hera spacecraft is designed to travel to the asteroid system after the impact and provide a detailed survey of the crater created by the impact.

As of the 2020 census, the population was 67,752. The city is part of the Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, DC-VA-MD Metropolitan Statistical Area.\n\n# History\n\nThe area that is now Waldorf was first settled in the early 18th century by European colonists. The land was originally part of a large grant made by the Lord Proprietor of Maryland, Charles Calvert, to Thomas Hemmings in 1662. Hemmings, an English settler, established a farm in the area and the settlement that would eventually become Waldorf began to grow.\n\nIn the late 19th century, the area around Waldorf began to attract settlers from the North, who were drawn by the fertile soil and the availability of land. The community was initially known as \"Benedict\", but in 1899, the name was changed to Waldorf, after the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York City, which was a luxury hotel that was popular among the wealthy elite at the time.\n\nDuring World War I, the United States government established a military base in the area, which was used for training and as a staging ground for troops being sent to Europe. Following the war, the base was closed and the area was returned to civilian use.\n\nIn the mid-20th century, the area began to experience rapid growth, as the population of the region began to expand. The construction of the Capital Beltway and the Baltimore-Washington Parkway made it easier for people to commute to work in Washington, D.C. and other cities in the region, and the area became a popular place to live for those who wanted to be close to the city but still have a rural feel.\n\nToday, Waldorf is a thriving city with a diverse economy and a rich history.

This article provides an overview of the outbreak's background, characteristics, chronology, transmission, interventions, social aspects, and responses.\n\nBackground\n\n### Emergency Preparedness Prior to Outbreak\n\nPrior to the outbreak, several countries had established emergency preparedness plans for potential mpox outbreaks. These plans included surveillance, testing, and containment measures to mitigate the spread of the virus. However, the rapid spread of the virus in May 2022 caught many countries off guard, highlighting the need for more effective emergency preparedness and response systems.\n\n### Endemic Mpox in Africa\n\nMpox is endemic in several countries in Central and West Africa, including the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Republic of the Congo, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, and Nigeria. In these countries, the virus has been circulating for decades, causing sporadic outbreaks and occasional cases of severe disease. The virus is typically transmitted to humans through contact with infected animals, such as rodents and primates.\n\nOutbreak Characteristics\n\n### Phylogenetics\n\nThe 2022–2023 mpox outbreak is caused by a distinct clade of the monkeypox virus, which is different from the clades that are typically found in Africa. This clade has been identified as the \"West African\" clade, which is associated with milder disease outcomes. The virus has been found to be highly infectious and has been transmitted through close contact with infected individuals, often through skin-to-skin contact or through contaminated materials.\n\n### Long Incubation Periods\n\nThe incubation period of the virus, which is the time between exposure to the virus and the onset of symptoms, is typically long, ranging from 5 to 21 days. This prolonged incubation period has made it challenging for public health officials to identify and contain cases of the virus.\n\n### Mild Clinical Manifestations\n\nThe clinical manifestations of mpox are typically mild, with symptoms including fever, headache, and rash. In some cases, the virus can cause more severe disease, including pneumonia and encephalitis. However, most cases of the virus have been mild, and many individuals have not required hospitalization.\n\n### Fear of Zoonotic Spread\n\nThere is ongoing concern that the virus could be transmitted to animals, such as pets and livestock, which could lead to the establishment of new animal reservoirs of the virus. This has led to calls for increased surveillance and monitoring of animal populations for signs of infection.\n\nChronology\n\n### Deaths Outside of Africa\n\nAs of March 2023, there have been reported deaths outside of Africa, including in Europe and the Americas. The majority of these deaths have occurred in individuals with underlying health conditions or who were elderly.\n\nTransmission\n\n### Transmission Patterns\n\nThe virus has been transmitted through close contact with infected individuals, often through skin-to-skin contact or through contaminated materials. The virus has also been found to be transmitted through respiratory droplets and contact with contaminated surfaces. The virus has been spread through various settings, including healthcare facilities, social gatherings, and community events.\n\n### Wastewater Surveillance\n\nSeveral countries have implemented wastewater surveillance programs to detect the presence of the virus in wastewater. This has allowed public health officials to identify potential cases of the virus and take steps to contain its spread.\n\nInterventions\n\n### Testing and Containment\n\nPublic health officials have implemented testing and containment measures to mitigate the spread of the virus. These measures include contact tracing, isolation of infected individuals, and quarantine of close contacts. The use of personal protective equipment (PPE) has also been recommended for healthcare workers and other individuals who may be at risk of exposure.\n\n### Vaccination\n\nSeveral countries have implemented vaccination programs to prevent the spread of the virus. Vaccination has been offered to high-risk individuals, such as healthcare workers and individuals with underlying health conditions. The use of vaccines has been shown to be effective in preventing the spread of the virus and reducing the severity of disease.\n\nSocial Aspects\n\n### Misinformation\n\nThere has been ongoing concern about the spread of misinformation about the virus and its transmission. This has led to confusion and anxiety among the public, which has made it challenging for public health officials to implement effective interventions.\n\nResponses\n\n### World Health Organization\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has played a key role in responding to the outbreak, providing technical assistance and guidance to countries. The WHO has also led international efforts to coordinate the response to the outbreak and share data and resources.\n\n### Countries\n\nCountries have implemented a range of interventions to respond to the outbreak, including testing and containment measures, vaccination programs, and public awareness campaigns. Some countries have also implemented travel restrictions and quarantine measures to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\n### Dependent Territories\n\nSeveral dependent territories, including Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands, have reported cases of the virus. These territories have implemented interventions to respond to the outbreak, including testing and containment measures and vaccination programs.\n\nCases per Country and Territory\n\n### Timeline of First Confirmed Cases by Country or Territory\n\n| Country or Territory | Date of First Confirmed Case |\n| --- | --- |\n| Spain | May 25, 2022 |\n| Portugal | May 25, 2022 |\n| United Kingdom | May 26, 2022 |\n| Italy | May 28, 2022 |\n| United States | May 29, 2022 |\n| Canada | May 29, 2022 |\n| France | June 1, 2022 |\n| Germany | June 1, 2022 |\n| Australia | June 3, 2022 |\n| Japan | June 3, 2022 |\n| Brazil | June 5, 2022 |\n| Mexico | June 5, 2022 |\n| Vietnam | June 6, 2022 |\n| India | June 7, 2022 |\n| South Africa | June 8, 2022 |\n| Morocco | June 9, 2022 |\n\n### Timeline of Suspected Cases by Country or Territory\n\n| Country or Territory | Date of First Suspected Case |\n| --- | --- |\n| United States | May 21, 2022 |\n| Canada | May 22, 2022 |\n| United Kingdom | May 24, 2022 |\n| Italy | May 25, 2022 |\n| Spain | May 26, 2022 |\n| France | May 27, 2022 |\n| Germany | May 28, 2022 |\n| Australia | May 29, 2022 |\n| Japan | May 30, 2022 |\n| Brazil | May 31, 2022 |\n| Mexico | June 1, 2022 |\n| Vietnam | June 2, 2022 |\n| India | June 4, 2022 |\n| South Africa | June 5, 2022 |\n| Morocco | June 6, 2022 |\n\n### Timeline of First Deaths by Country or Territory (in Countries with Initial 2022 Detection from 6 May onwards)\n\n| Country or Territory | Date of First Death |\n| --- | --- |\n| Spain | June 3, 2022 |\n| Portugal | June 4, 2022 |\n| United Kingdom | June 6, 2022 |\n| Italy | June 8, 2022 |\n| United States | June 9, 2022 |\n| Canada | June 10, 2022 |\n| France | June 12, 2022 |\n| Germany | June 13, 2022 |\n| Australia | June 15, 2022 |\n| Japan | June 17, 2022 |\n| Brazil | June 19, 2022 |\n| Mexico | June 20, 2022 |\n| Vietnam | June 22, 2022 |\n| India | June 24, 2022 |\n| South Africa | June 26, 2022 |\n| Morocco | June 28, 2022 |\n\nSee also\n\n* Monkeypox\n* Monkeypox virus\n* 2018–2020 Democratic Republic of the Congo monkeypox outbreak\n* 2021–2022 monkeypox outbreak in Europe\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n* World Health Organization: Monkeypox\n* Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Monkeypox", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022–2023_mpox_outbreak\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Emergency preparedness prior to outbreak\n##Endemic mpox in Africa\n#Outbreak characteristics\n##Phylogenetics\n##Long incubation periods\n##Mild clinical manifestations\n##Fear of zoonotic spread\n#Chronology\n##Deaths outside of Africa\n#Transmission\n##Transmission patterns\n##Wastewater surveillance\n#Interventions\n##Testing and containment\n##Vaccination\n#Social aspects\n##Misinformation\n#Responses\n##World Health Organization\n##Countries\n##Dependent territories\n#Cases per country and territory\n##Timeline of first confirmed cases by country or territory\n##Timeline of suspected cases by country or territory\n##Timeline of first deaths by country or territory (in countries with initial 2022 detection from 6 May onwards)\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He is considered one of the greatest mathematicians of all time, and his work had a profound impact on the development of mathematics, physics, and astronomy.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nBorn on April 30, 1777, in Braunschweig, Germany, Gauss's early life was marked by poverty and hardship. Despite these challenges, he demonstrated a remarkable aptitude for mathematics and science from an early age. Gauss's father, a bricklayer, encouraged his son's interest in mathematics, and he received support from his family and community throughout his education. This support enabled Gauss to pursue his passion for mathematics and eventually become one of the most influential mathematicians of the 19th century.\n\n**Youth and Education**\n\nGauss's early education took place in Braunschweig, where he attended the local school and showed exceptional aptitude for mathematics. In 1792, he began studying at the University of Göttingen, where he was awarded a scholarship and received support from the Duke of Brunswick. During his time at the university, Gauss developed a close relationship with his mentor, Johann Friedrich Pfaff, who introduced him to the works of Leonhard Euler and Joseph-Louis Lagrange. Gauss's mathematical abilities quickly gained recognition, and he was awarded a doctorate in 1799 without having to complete a dissertation.\n\n**Private Scholar**\n\nAfter completing his education, Gauss returned to Braunschweig, where he lived a reclusive life as a private scholar. He supported himself through his mathematical work, producing several important contributions to number theory, algebra, and geometry. During this period, Gauss developed his groundbreaking work on the fundamental theorem of algebra, which would later become a cornerstone of mathematics. His work on this theorem, as well as his other contributions to mathematics, earned him international recognition and admiration.\n\n**Professor in Göttingen**\n\nIn 1807, Gauss accepted a professorship at the University of Göttingen, where he would spend the remainder of his career. At Göttingen, Gauss became a prominent figure in the academic community, attracting students from across Europe. He delivered several influential lectures, including his famous \"Disquisitiones Arithmeticae,\" which laid the foundation for modern number theory. Gauss's time at Göttingen was marked by significant scientific achievements, including his work on the theory of errors, differential geometry, and non-Euclidean geometry.\n\n**Gauss's Brain**\n\nAfter Gauss's death in 1855, his brain was preserved and studied by his friend and student, Rudolf Wagner. Wagner's examination of Gauss's brain revealed a higher-than-average number of convolutions, which some have linked to Gauss's exceptional mathematical abilities. While the exact significance of this finding is unclear, it has become a popular anecdote in the history of mathematics.\n\n**Family**\n\nGauss married Johanna Osthoff in 1805, and they had three children together. However, Johanna died of malaria in 1809, leaving Gauss to care for their children alone. In 1810, Gauss married Minna Waldeck, who supported him throughout his life and provided emotional stability.\n\n**Personality**\n\nGauss was known for his eccentric personality, which was marked by shyness, introversion, and a tendency to be perfectionistic. Despite these traits, he was a kind and generous person who supported his friends and colleagues. Gauss's love of nature and music was well-documented, and he was an accomplished pianist.\n\n**Scholar**\n\nGauss's contributions to mathematics and science are unparalleled. He made groundbreaking discoveries in number theory, algebra, and geometry, and his work had a profound impact on the development of mathematics. Gauss's most famous contribution is perhaps his fundamental theorem of algebra, which states that every polynomial equation has at least one complex root.\n\n**Private Man**\n\nGauss's private life was marked by simplicity and modesty. He lived a reclusive life, preferring the company of nature and music to that of people. Despite his fame and recognition, Gauss remained humble and unassuming, preferring to focus on his work rather than seek personal glory.\n\n**Scientific Work**\n\nGauss's scientific work spans several fields, including mathematics, physics, and astronomy.\n\n**Algebra and Number Theory**\n\nGauss's work in algebra and number theory is considered some of the most influential in the history of mathematics. His contributions to the fundamental theorem of algebra, as well as his work on the theory of numbers, laid the foundation for modern number theory.\n\n**Fundamental Theorem of Algebra**\n\nThe fundamental theorem of algebra states that every polynomial equation has at least one complex root. Gauss's work on this theorem, as well as his proof of the theorem, is considered one of the most significant contributions to mathematics.\n\n**Disquisitiones Arithmeticae**\n\nGauss's work on the Disquisitiones Arithmeticae is considered one of the most influential works in the history of mathematics. This work laid the foundation for modern number theory and had a profound impact on the development of mathematics.\n\n**Further Investigations**\n\nGauss's work on number theory continued throughout his life, with significant contributions to the theory of quadratic forms, elliptic functions, and modular forms.\n\n**Analysis**\n\nGauss's work in analysis is considered some of the most influential in the history of mathematics. His contributions to numeric analysis, differential equations, and calculus laid the foundation for modern analysis.\n\n**Numeric Analysis**\n\nGauss's work on numeric analysis, including his development of the method of least squares, is considered some of the most important contributions to the field.\n\n**Chronology**\n\nGauss's work on chronology, including his development of the theory of the date of Easter, is considered some of the most important contributions to the field.\n\n**Astronomy**\n\nGauss's work in astronomy is considered some of the most influential in the history of astronomy.

Established in 1994, the league has undergone several changes in its format and governance. Liga 1 is organized by the Indonesian Football Association (PSSI) and is considered one of the most popular and competitive football leagues in Southeast Asia.\n\n**#History**\n\n### ##Origins\n\nThe history of Liga 1 dates back to 1930 when the first-ever Indonesian football championship was held. However, it was not until 1994 that the modern Liga 1 was established. The league was initially known as the Indonesian Premier League and was formed by a group of prominent clubs in the country.\n\n### ##Foundation\n\nThe first season of the Indonesian Premier League took place in 1994, with 10 teams competing in the inaugural tournament. The league was initially designed to be a domestic competition, but it quickly gained popularity and expanded to include teams from neighboring countries.\n\n### ##Dualism\n\nIn the early 2000s, Liga 1 faced a major crisis when the Indonesian Football Association (PSSI) and the Indonesian Ministry of Youth and Sports disagreed over the management of the league. The PSSI wanted to maintain control over the league, while the ministry wanted to take over its management. This dualism led to a split in the league, with some teams withdrawing from the competition.\n\n### ##Government intervention and FIFA suspension\n\nIn 2007, the Indonesian government intervened in the management of Liga 1, leading to a further crisis in the league. The government's decision to take over the league was met with opposition from the PSSI and FIFA, which suspended Indonesia from international football competitions. The suspension lasted for several years, during which time Liga 1 was unable to participate in international competitions.\n\n### ##Name change\n\nIn 2013, the Indonesian Premier League was renamed Liga 1, following a rebranding effort by the PSSI. The name change was part of a broader effort to modernize the league and improve its competitive balance.\n\n**#Competition format**\n\n### ##Competition\n\nLiga 1 is an annual competition that takes place between April and November. The league features 18 teams competing in a round-robin format, with each team playing the others twice. The team with the most points at the end of the season is crowned the champion.\n\n### ##Promotion and relegation\n\nThe bottom three teams in Liga 1 are relegated to the Indonesian Second Division, while the top three teams in the second division are promoted to Liga 1.\n\n### ##Video assistant referee\n\nLiga 1 introduced video assistant referee (VAR) technology in the 2022 season, following a trial period in the 2021 season. VAR is used to assist referees in making decisions on goals, penalties, and other key incidents.\n\n**#Clubs**\n\n### ##Champions\n\nA number of clubs have won the Liga 1 title since its establishment in 1994. Some of the most successful clubs in the league include:\n\n* Persib Bandung\n* Persija Jakarta\n* Bhayangkara FC\n* Persebaya Surabaya\n\n### ##Performance by clubs\n\nThe performance of clubs in Liga 1 can vary from season to season. Some clubs have been consistently competitive, while others have struggled to achieve success. The table below shows the performance of the top teams in Liga 1 over the past five seasons:\n\n| Season | Champion | Runner-up | Third place |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2019 | Persib Bandung | Bhayangkara FC | Persebaya Surabaya |\n| 2020 | Persija Jakarta | Persib Bandung | Persebaya Surabaya |\n| 2021 | Persebaya Surabaya | Persib Bandung | Bhayangkara FC |\n| 2022 | Persib Bandung | Persebaya Surabaya | Persija Jakarta |\n| 2023 | Persija Jakarta | Persebaya Surabaya | Bhayangkara FC |\n\n### ##2024–25 season\n\nThe 2024–25 season of Liga 1 is expected to feature the same 18 teams that competed in the previous season. The competition format and rules remain unchanged.\n\n**###Maps**\n\nA map showing the location of Liga 1 teams is available online.\n\n### ##Former clubs\n\nA number of clubs have competed in Liga 1 over the years but are no longer part of the competition.

The investigation, led by the United States Department of Justice, has resulted in a series of indictments, arraignments, and pretrial proceedings, including a highly publicized request by Trump to delay the trial indefinitely.\n\n# Background\n\nThe investigation into Trump's handling of classified documents began in August 2022, when the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) discovered that Trump had taken boxes of documents with him when he left the White House in January 2021. The documents, which included classified materials, were eventually returned to NARA, but not before they were stored in a makeshift facility at Mar-a-Lago, Trump's private estate in Florida.\n\nIn February 2023, the FBI executed a search warrant at Mar-a-Lago, seizing additional documents and other materials related to the investigation. The search warrant was the result of a grand jury subpoena issued to Trump in November 2022, which required him to produce all documents related to the investigation.\n\n# Indictments and arraignments\n\n## Original indictment\n\nOn June 8, 2023, a federal grand jury in the Southern District of Florida returned an 11-count indictment against Trump, charging him with willful retention of national defense information, conspiracy to obstruct justice, and other crimes. The indictment alleged that Trump had knowingly and willfully retained the classified documents at Mar-a-Lago, despite being informed by his lawyers and other officials that the documents were sensitive and should be returned to the government.\n\n## Superseding indictment\n\nOn June 22, 2023, a superseding indictment was returned, adding additional charges against Trump, including obstruction of justice and conspiracy to commit obstruction of justice. The superseding indictment alleged that Trump had attempted to conceal the existence and location of the classified documents, and had directed his lawyers and other employees to lie to the government about the documents' whereabouts.\n\n## Assignment of district judge\n\nIn a rare move, the presiding judge of the trial, Aileen Cannon, was recused from the case due to her prior relationship with Trump. On August 1, 2023, the case was reassigned to Judge Eileen Cannon's colleague, Judge Donald Middlebrooks, who had previously presided over the Trump Organization's tax evasion trial.\n\n## Arraignments\n\n### Trump\n\nOn June 13, 2023, Trump was arraigned in federal court in West Palm Beach, Florida, where he pleaded not guilty to the charges against him. Trump's lawyer, Christopher Kise, entered a not guilty plea on his behalf, stating that Trump had done nothing wrong and that the charges were \"baseless\" and \"politically motivated\".\n\n### Nauta\n\nOn July 17, 2023, Trump's former chief of staff, John Nauta, was arraigned on charges of conspiracy to obstruct justice and making false statements to the government. Nauta allegedly helped Trump conceal the existence and location of the classified documents, and lied to the FBI about the documents' whereabouts.\n\n### De Oliveira\n\nOn August 14, 2023, Trump's former lawyer, Christina De Oliveira, was arraigned on charges of conspiracy to obstruct justice and making false statements to the government. De Oliveira allegedly helped Trump conceal the existence and location of the classified documents, and lied to the FBI about the documents' whereabouts.\n\n# Pretrial proceedings\n\n## 2023\n\nIn the months following Trump's arraignment, the case continued to unfold, with the government presenting evidence and witnesses to support its claims. On August 1, 2023, the government submitted a motion to the court, arguing that Trump had waived his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent by making public statements that contradicted his testimony.\n\n## 2024\n\nIn January 2024, Trump's lawyers filed a motion to delay the trial indefinitely, citing concerns about the government's evidence and the timing of the trial.

This approach has become increasingly popular in the gaming industry, offering a unique combination of creativity, community involvement, and flexibility. In this article, we will explore the definition and differentiation of open-source video games, their background, history, and the current state of the industry.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe concept of open-source software has been around for decades, but it wasn't until the 1990s that the idea began to gain traction in the gaming industry. With the rise of the internet and the proliferation of personal computers, it became easier for developers to share and collaborate on game code. Today, open-source video games have become a significant part of the gaming landscape, offering a new way for developers, artists, and players to come together and create something unique.\n\n**Definition and Differentiation**\n\nOpen-source video games are characterized by their use of open-source licenses, such as the GNU General Public License (GPL) or the MIT License. These licenses allow users to freely modify, distribute, and use the game's source code, as long as they adhere to the terms of the license. This approach differs from proprietary games, which are owned and controlled by a single entity and are not open to modification or distribution.\n\nOpen-source games also often involve a collaborative development process, where a community of developers and contributors work together to create and improve the game. This approach can lead to a more dynamic and engaging gaming experience, as players can influence the direction of the game and contribute to its development.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe concept of open-source gaming has its roots in the 1980s, when developers began sharing and modifying game code to create new and innovative experiences. However, it wasn't until the 1990s that the idea began to gain momentum, with the release of games such as Doom and Quake, which were created using open-source engines.\n\nIn the early 2000s, the open-source gaming movement gained significant momentum, with the release of games such as Nexuiz and OpenTTD. These games were created using open-source engines and were distributed under open-source licenses, allowing users to modify and distribute the game's source code.\n\n**History**\n\n### Beginnings and Early Games\n\nThe earliest open-source games date back to the 1980s, when developers began sharing and modifying game code to create new and innovative experiences. One of the earliest open-source games was the game \"Adventure,\" which was created by Warren Robinett in 1979. The game was released under an open-source license, allowing users to modify and distribute the game's source code.\n\nIn the 1990s, the open-source gaming movement gained momentum, with the release of games such as Doom and Quake. These games were created using open-source engines and were distributed under open-source licenses, allowing users to modify and distribute the game's source code.\n\n### 3D Games and Source Releases\n\nIn the early 2000s, the open-source gaming movement gained significant momentum, with the release of games such as Nexuiz and OpenTTD. These games were created using open-source engines and were distributed under open-source licenses, allowing users to modify and distribute the game's source code.\n\nOne of the most popular open-source games of the early 2000s was Nexuiz, a 3D first-person shooter that was created using the id Tech 3 engine. The game was released under an open-source license in 2005 and quickly gained a large following among gamers.\n\n### Rise in Popularity and Diversity\n\nIn the mid-2000s, the open-source gaming movement continued to gain momentum, with the release of games such as OpenArena and Warsow. These games were created using open-source engines and were distributed under open-source licenses, allowing users to modify and distribute the game's source code.\n\nOne of the most popular open-source games of the mid-2000s was OpenArena, a 3D first-person shooter that was created using the ioquake3 engine. The game was released under an open-source license in 2007 and quickly gained a large following among gamers.\n\n### Greater Organization\n\nIn the late 2000s, the open-source gaming movement began to take on a more formal structure, with the establishment of organizations such as the Open Source Initiative (OSI) and the Free Software Foundation (FSF). These organizations provided a framework for developers to collaborate and share resources, and helped to promote the use of open-source licenses in the gaming industry.\n\n### Hubs and Development Teams\n\nToday, the open-source gaming movement is characterized by the presence of hubs and development teams, which bring together developers and contributors to create and improve games. One of the most well-known hubs is the Open Source Game Development (OSGD) community, which has been active since the early 2000s.\n\nAnother well-known hub is the Free and Open Source Software for Gamers (FOSS-G) community, which was established in 2007. This community provides a platform for developers and contributors to share resources and collaborate on open-source game development projects.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Open-source software\n* Free and open-source game development\n* Game development\n* Community-driven game development\n\n**References**\n\nThis article does not include any citations or references.\n\n**External links**\n\n* Open Source Initiative (OSI)\n* Free Software Foundation (FSF)\n* Open Source Game Development (OSGD)\n* Free and Open Source Software for Gamers (FOSS-G)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Open-source_video_game\" following this outline:\n\n#Definition and differentiation\n#Background\n#History\n##Beginnings and early games\n##3D games and source releases\n##Rise in popularity and diversity\n##Greater organization\n##Hubs and development teams\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
