{"title": "Hamas", "content": "\nEtymology\nHamas is an acronym of the Arabic phrase حركة المقاومة الإسلامية or Ḥarakah al-Muqāwamah al-ʾIslāmiyyah, meaning \"Islamic Resistance Movement\" This acronym, HMS, was glossed in the 1988 Hamas Covenant [103] by the Arabic word ḥamās (حماس) which itself means \"zeal\", \"strength\", or \"bravery\" [104]\n\n\nHistory\nHamas was established in 1987, and allegedly has its origins in Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood movement, which had been active in the Gaza Strip since the 1950s and gained influence through a network of mosques and various charitable and social organizations Unlike other Palestinian factions, after the Israeli occupation of Gaza in 1967, the Brotherhood in Gaza refused to join the resistance boycott against Israel [105] In the 1980s, it emerged as a powerful political factor, challenging the influence of the PLO, whose Fatah faction it had played a core role in creating [105] In December 1987, the Brotherhood adopted a more nationalist and activist line under the name of Hamas [106] Hamas was initially discretely supported by Israel as a counter-balance to the secular PLO [107] During the 1990s and early 2000s, the organization conducted numerous suicide bombings and other attacks against Israel [108]\n\n\nPolicies towards Israel and Palestine\nHamas' policy towards Israel has evolved Historically, Hamas envisioned a Palestinian state on all of the territory that belonged to the British Mandate for Palestine (that is, from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea) [130] In 2006, Hamas signed the Palestinian Prisoners' Document which supports the quest for a Palestinian state along the 1967 borders [131] [132] This document also recognized authority of the President of the Palestinian National Authority to negotiate with Israel [132] Hamas also signed the Cairo Declaration in 2005, which emphasized the goal of ending the Israeli occupation and establishing a Palestinian state [76] On 2 May 2017, Khaled Mashal, chief of the Hamas Political Bureau, presented a new Charter, in which Hamas accepted the establishment of a Palestinian state \"on the basis of June 4, 1967\" (West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem) acceptable But the new Charter did not recognize Israel nor relinquish Palestinian claims to all of historical Palestine [77] Many scholars saw Hamas' acceptance of the 1967 borders as a tacit acceptance of another entity on the other side [133] [134] [135]while others state that Hamas retains the long-term objective of establishing one state in former Mandatory Palestine [84] [85]\n\n\nTruce proposals\nHamas has repeatedly offered Israel a hudna, Arabic word for armistice, of varying durations (50 years, [136] even a 100 years [81]) During the hudna both the Israelis and Palestinians would refrain from any violent attacks on the other Under Islamic international law, a hudna is a binding and the Qur'an prohibits its violation [137] Hamas's spokesperson, Ahmed Yousef, said that a \"hudna\" is more than a ceasefire and it \"obliges parties to use the period to seek a permanent, non-violent resolution to their differences.\" [138]\n\n\nRecognition of Israel\nWhether Hamas would recognize Israel is debated [146] [147] [148] Hamas leaders have emphasized they do not recognize Israel, [77] but indicate they \"have a de facto acceptance of its presence\" [149] According to some scholars, Hamas accepted the 1967 borders and thus acknowledged the existence of another entity on the other side, [150] implicitly recognizing Israel [134] and \"drop [ping] the call for the destruction of Israel from its manifesto.\" [135] Other scholars believe that Hamas retains the long-term objective of establishing one state in former Mandatory Palestine [84] [85]\n\n\nAntisemitism\nThe 1988 Hamas charter proclaims that jihad against Jews is required until Judgement Day [155] [156] The \"governing\" 1988 charter of Hamas was said, in 2018, to \"openly dedicate(s) Hamas to genocide against the Jewish people\", referring to the Hamas 1988 charter, article 7 [157] More authors have characterized the violent language against all Jews in the original Hamas charter as genocidal, [158] incitement to genocide, [159] [160] or antisemitic [161] [162] The charter attributes collective responsibility to Jews, not just Israelis, for various global issues, including both World Wars [163]\n\n\nEvolution of positions\nIn its early days, Hamas functioned as a social-religious charity center Its members armed themselves for the ongoing resistance against the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories, and in August 1988 published their first charter in which Hamas stated that \"Israel\" should be \"eliminated\" through a \"clash with the enemies\", a \"struggle against Zionism\" and \"conflict with Israel\" [169]: preamble, art 14, 15, 32  They wrote that 'Palestine', that is all of the territory that belonged to the British Mandate for Palestine (that is, from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea), [130] should be \"liberated\" from \"Zionism\" [169]: art 14  and transformed into an Islamic Waqf (Islamic charitable endowment) in which \"followers of all religions can coexist in security and safety\" [170]: art 6, 11  [171] Practically speaking, Hamas is and was at war with Israel's army (later also attacking Israeli civilians) since the spring of 1989, initially as part of the First Intifada, a general protest movement that gradually turned more riotous and violent.\n\n\n1988–1992 (first charter)\nIn its early days, Hamas functioned as a social-religious charity center Its members armed themselves for the ongoing resistance against the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories, and in August 1988 published their first charter in which Hamas stated that \"Israel\" should be \"eliminated\" through a \"clash with the enemies\", a \"struggle against Zionism\" and \"conflict with Israel\" [169]: preamble, art 14, 15, 32  They wrote that 'Palestine', that is all of the territory that belonged to the British Mandate for Palestine (that is, from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea), [130] should be \"liberated\" from \"Zionism\" [169]: art 14  and transformed into an Islamic Waqf (Islamic charitable endowment) in which \"followers of all religions can coexist in security and safety\" [170]: art 6, 11  [171] Practically speaking, Hamas is and was at war with Israel's army (later also attacking Israeli civilians) since the spring of 1989, initially as part of the First Intifada, a general protest movement that gradually turned more riotous and violent.\n\n\n1992–2005\nSheikh Ahmed Yassin, founder of Hamas, who died in 2004 (killed by Israel), has at unreported date offered Israel a ten-year hudna (truce, armistice) in return for establishment of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Yassin later added, the hudna could be renewed, even for longer periods, but would never signal a recognition of Israel [81]\n\n\n2006–2007: 1967 borders and a truce\nIn March 2006, after winning an absolute majority in the 2006 Palestinian legislative elections, Hamas published its government program in which Hamas claimed sovereignty for the Palestinian territories but did not repeat its claim to all of mandatory Palestine, instead declared their willingness to have contacts with Israel \"in all mundane affairs: business, trade, health, and labor\" [172] The program further stated: \"The question of recognizing Israel is not the jurisdiction of one faction, nor the government, but a decision for the Palestinian people.\" [173]\nSince then until today, spokesmen of Hamas seem to disagree about their attitudes towards Israel, and debates are running as to whether the original 1988 Hamas charter has since March 2006 become obsolete and irrelevant or on the contrary still spells out Hamas's genuine and ultimate goals (see: 1988 Hamas charter, § Relevance).\n\n\n2008–2016\nIn April 2008, former US President Jimmy Carter met with Khaled Mashal, the recognized Hamas leader since 2004 Mashal said to Carter, Hamas would \"accept a Palestinian state on the 1967 borders\" and accept the right of Israel \"to live as a neighbour\" if such a deal would be approved by a referendum among the \"Palestinians\" Nevertheless, Mashal did not offer a unilateral ceasefire (as Carter had suggested him to do) The US State Department showed utter indifference for Mashal's new stance; Israel's Prime Minister Ehud Olmert even refused to meet with Carter in Jerusalem, not to mention paying attention to the new Hamas stance [179]\n\n\n2017– 6 Oct. 2023 (new charter)\nOn 1 May 2017, in a press conference in Doha (Qatar) presenting a new charter, Khaled Mashal, chief of the Hamas Political Bureau (thus acknowledged as to be highest Hamas leader), declared that, though Hamas considered the establishment of a Palestinian state \"on the basis of June 4, 1967\" (West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem being not under Israeli reign) acceptable, Hamas would in that case still not recognise the statehood of Israel and not relinquish their goal of liberating all of Palestine from \"the Zionist project\" [77] [190]\n\n\n7 Oct. 2023–present\nIn a flash attack on 7 October 2023, Hamas and associates murdered 767 civilians and killed a further 376 security personnel of the state of Israel Israel retaliated with warfare in the Gaza Strip, aiming at Hamas militants but also harming much civilian infrastructure and directly killing tens of thousands of civilians, as admitted even by Israel (not counting the presumed multiple number of indirect deaths) A number of conflicting statements since then were made by Hamas senior leaders regarding the Hamas policy towards Israel.\n\n\nComments from non-Hamas-members\nThe vision that Hamas articulated in its original 1988 charter resembles the vision of certain Zionist groups regarding the same territory, as noted by several authors [185] [201] [202] This may suggest that Hamas's views were inspired by those Zionist perspectives [m] [204] [205]\n\n\nReligious policy\nThe gender ideology outlined in the Hamas charter, the importance of women in the religious-nationalist project of liberation is asserted as no lesser than that of males Their role was defined primarily as one of manufacturing males and caring for their upbringing and rearing, though the charter recognized they could fight for liberation without obtaining their husband's permission and in 2002 their participation in jihad was permitted [214] The doctrinal emphasis on childbearing and rearing as woman's primary duty is not so different from Fatah's view of women in the First Intifada and it also resembles the outlook of Jewish settlers, and over time it has been subjected to change [215] [216]\n\n\nGaza Strip\nThe gender ideology outlined in the Hamas charter, the importance of women in the religious-nationalist project of liberation is asserted as no lesser than that of males Their role was defined primarily as one of manufacturing males and caring for their upbringing and rearing, though the charter recognized they could fight for liberation without obtaining their husband's permission and in 2002 their participation in jihad was permitted [214] The doctrinal emphasis on childbearing and rearing as woman's primary duty is not so different from Fatah's view of women in the First Intifada and it also resembles the outlook of Jewish settlers, and over time it has been subjected to change [215] [216]\n\n\nIn the West Bank\nIn 2005, the human rights organization Freemuse released a report titled \"Palestine: Taliban-like attempts to censor music\", which said that Palestinian musicians feared that harsh religious laws against music and concerts will be imposed since Hamas group scored political gains in the Palestinian Authority local elections of 2005 [224]\n\n\nErdoğan's Turkey as a role model\nSome Hamas members have stated that the model of Islamic government that Hamas seeks to emulate is that of Turkey under the rule of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan The foremost members to distance Hamas from the practices of the Taliban and to publicly support the Erdoğan model were Ahmed Yousef and Ghazi Hamad, advisers to Prime Minister Hanieh [229] [230] Yusuf, the Hamas deputy foreign minister, reflected this goal in an interview with a Turkish newspaper, stating that while foreign public opinion equates Hamas with the Taliban or al-Qaeda, the analogy is inaccurate Yusuf described the Taliban as \"opposed to everything\", including education and women's rights, while Hamas wants to establish good relations between the religious and secular elements of society and strives for human rights, democracy and an open society [231] According to professor Yezid Sayigh of King's College in London, how influential this view is within Hamas is uncertain, since both Ahmad Yousef and Ghazi Hamad were dismissed from their posts as advisers to Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Hanieh in October 2007 [229] Both have since been appointed to other prominent positions within the Hamas government Khaled al-Hroub of the West Bank-based and anti-Hamas [232] Palestinian daily Al Ayyam added that despite claims by Hamas leaders that it wants to repeat the Turkish model of Islam, \"what is happening on the ground in reality is a replica of the Taliban model of Islam.\" [233] [234]\n\n\nCharter and policy documents\nHamas published its charter in August 1988, wherein it defined itself as a chapter of the Muslim Brotherhood and its desire to establish \"an Islamic state throughout Palestine\" [235] The foundational document was written by a single individual and made public without going through the usual prior consultation process [n] It was then signed on August 18, 1988 It compares Israeli attacks on civilians to that by Nazi Germany [237] The charter also claims all of historical Palestine [238] [239] [o] [241] but promises religious coexistence under Islam's rule [242]  [243] Article 6 states that the movement's aim is to \"raise the banner of Allah over every inch of Palestine, for under the wing of Islam followers of all religions can coexist in security and safety where their lives, possessions and rights are concerned\" [170] [244] The charter rejects a two-state solution, stating that the conflict cannot be resolved \"except through jihad\".\n\n\n1988 charter\nHamas

May 2017, Hamas published a document titled \"A Document of General Principles and Policies\" While this policy document was much shorter than the 1988 charter, and Hamas leaders stated that it did not replace the 1988 charter, [248] it covers some of the same topics and is sometimes referred to in English as the \"2017 charter\"  It accepted a Palestinian state in the 1967 borders, without recognizing Israel, and argued that armed resistance to occupation is supported by international law [249] [250] [84] [155] [190] Hamas has described these changes as adaptation within a specific context, as opposed to abandonment of its principles [251]\n\n\nOrganization\nHamas inherited from its predecessor a tripartite structure that consisted in the provision of social services, of religious training and military operations under a Shura Council Traditionally it had four distinct functions: (a) a charitable social welfare division (dawah); (b) a military division for procuring weapons and undertaking operations (al-Mujahideen al Filastinun); (c) a security service (Jehaz Aman); and (d) a media branch (A'alam) [253] Hamas has both an internal leadership within the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and an external leadership, split between a Gaza group directed by Mousa Abu Marzook from his exile first in Damascus and then in Egypt, and a Kuwaiti group (Kuwaidia) under Khaled Mashal [254] [needs update] The Kuwaiti group of Palestinian exiles began to receive extensive funding from the Gulf States after its leader Mashal broke with Yasser Arafat's decision to side with Saddam Hussein in the Invasion of Kuwait, with Mashal insisting that Iraq withdraw [255] On May 6, 2017, Hamas' Shura Council chose Ismail Haniyeh to become the new leader, to replace Mashal [256]\n\n\nLeadership and structure\nHamas inherited from its predecessor a tripartite structure that consisted in the provision of social services, of religious training and military operations under

Mashal insisting that Iraq withdraw [255] On May 6, 2017, Hamas' Shura Council chose Ismail Haniyeh to become the new leader, to replace Mashal [256]\n\n\nShura Council and Political Bureau\nHamas's overarching governing body is the Majlis al-Shura (Shura Council), based on the Quranic concept of consultation and popular assembly (shura), which Hamas leaders argue provides for democracy within an Islamic framework [258] As the organization grew more complex and Israeli pressure increased, the Shura Council was renamed the General Consultative Council, with members elected from local council groups The council elects the 15-member Political Bureau (al-Maktab al-Siyasi) [259] that makes decisions for Hamas Representatives come from Gaza, the West Bank, leaders in exile and Israeli prisons [260] The Political Bureau was based in Damascus until January 2012, when Hamas's support for the Syrian opposition to Bashar al-Assad during the Syrian civil war led to the office's relocation to Qatar [260] [261]\n\n\nFinances and funding\nHamas, like its predecessor the Muslim Brotherhood, assumed the administration of Gaza's waqf properties, endowments which extend over 10% of all real estate in the Gaza Strip, with 2,000 acres of agricultural land held in religious trusts, together with numerous shops, rentable apartments and public buildings [262]\n\n\nSocial services wing\nHamas developed its social welfare programme by replicating the model established by Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood For Hamas, charity and the development of one's community are both prescribed by religion and to be understood as forms of resistance [284] In Islamic tradition, dawah (lit. transl. \"the call to God\") obliges the faithful to reach out to others by both proselytising and by charitable works, and typically the latter centre on the mosques which make use of both waqf endowment resources and charitable donations (zakat, one of the five pillars of Islam) to fund grassroots services such as nurseries, schools, orphanages, soup kitchens, women's activities, library services and even sporting clubs within a larger context of preaching and political discussions [285] In the 1990s, some 85% of its budget was allocated to the provision of social services [286] Hamas has been called perhaps the most significant social services actor in Palestine By 2000, Hamas or its affiliated charities ran roughly 40% of the social institutions in the West Bank and Gaza and, with other Islamic charities, by 2005, was supporting 120,000 individuals with monthly financial support in Gaza [287] Part of the appeal of these institutions is that they fill a vacuum in the administration by the PLO of the Palestinian territories, which had failed to cater to the demand for jobs and broad social services, and is widely viewed as corrupt [288] As late as 2005, the budget of Hamas, drawing on global charity contributions, was mostly tied up in covering running expenses for its social programmes, which extended from the supply of housing, food and water for the needy to more general functions such as financial aid, medical assistance, educational development and religious instruction A certain accounting flexibility allowed these funds to cover both charitable causes and military operations, permitting transfer from one to the other [289]\n\n\nMilitary wing\nThe Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades is Hamas' military wing [297] [298] While the number of members is known only to the Brigades leadership, Israel estimates the Brigades have a core of several hundred members who receive military style training, including training in Iran and in Syria (before the Syrian Civil War) [299] Additionally, the brigades have an estimated 10,000–17,000 operatives, [287] [300] other sources say 15,000–40,000 militants, [301] [302] [undue weight? – discuss] forming a backup force whenever circumstances call for reinforcements for the Brigade Recruitment training lasts for two years [299] The group's ideology outlines its aim as the liberation of Palestine and the restoration of Palestinian rights under the dispensations set forth in the Qur'an, and this translates into three policy priorities:\n\n\nGaza forces, October 2023\nDuring the 2023 Gaza war, the IDF published its intelligence about the Hamas military in the Strip [316] They put the strength of the Qassam Brigades there at the start of the war at 30,000 fighters, organised by area in five brigades, consisting in total of 24 battalions and c 140 companies [316] Each regional brigade had a number of strongholds and outposts, and included specialised arrays for rocket firing, anti-tank missiles, air defenses, snipers, and engineering [316]\n\n\nMedia\nAl-Aqsa TV is a television channel founded by Hamas [317] The station began broadcasting in the Gaza Strip on January 9, 2006, [318] [319] less than three weeks before the Palestinian legislative elections It has shown television programs, including some children's television, which deliver antisemitic messages [320] Hamas has stated that the television station is \"an independent media institution that often does not express the views of the Palestinian government headed by Ismail Haniyeh or of the Hamas movement\", and that Hamas does not hold antisemitic views [321] The programming includes ideologically tinged children's shows, news talk, and religiously inspired entertainment [322] According to the Anti-Defamation League, the station promotes terrorist activity and incites hatred of Jews and Israelis [319] Al-Aqsa TV is headed by the controversial Fathi Ahmad Hammad, chairman of al-Ribat Communications and Artistic Productions—a Hamas-run company that also produces Hamas's radio station, Voice of al-Aqsa, and its biweekly newspaper, The Message [323] Hamad has made a number of controversial comments, including a speech in which he reportedly stated: 'you have Jews everywhere and we must attack every Jew on the globe by way of slaughtering and killing'  [324]\n\n\nAl-Aqsa TV\nAl-Aqsa TV is a television channel founded by Hamas [317] The station began broadcasting in the Gaza Strip on January 9, 2006, [318] [319] less

speech in which he reportedly stated: 'you have Jews everywhere and we must attack every Jew on the globe by way of slaughtering and killing'  [324]\n\n\nAl-Fateh magazine\nAl-Fateh (\"the conqueror\") is the Hamas children's magazine, published biweekly in London, and also posted in an online website It began publication in September 2002, and its 108th issue was released in mid-September 2007 The magazine features stories, poems, riddles, and puzzles, and states it is for \"the young builders of the future\" [325]\n\n\nSocial media\nHamas has traditionally presented itself as a voice of suffering of the Palestinian people According to Time magazine, a new social media strategy was employed in the wake of the October 7 attack: Hamas asserted itself as the dominant resistance force in the Middle East by recording and broadcasting the brutality of their attacks [327]\n\n\nInternal security\nThe General Security Service, formally part of the Hamas political party, operates akin to a governmental body within Gaza Under the direct oversight of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, it conducts extensive surveillance on Palestinians, compiling files on various individuals including journalists and government critics This secret police force relies on a network of informants and employs tactics such as censorship and surveillance to maintain control Before the conflict with Israel, the unit reportedly had a monthly budget of $120,000 and consisted of 856 personnel, including more than 160 individuals paid to spread Hamas propaganda and conduct online attacks against opponents [330]\n\n\nSymbols\nThe flag of Hamas is a green field (a traditionally respected color in Islam) charged in the middle with the writing of the Shahada, an Islamic statement of faith, in white calligraphic script: \"There is no god but God\" and \"Muhammad is the messenger of God\" [331] [332]\n\n\nViolence\nHamas has used both political activities and violence in pursuit of its goals For example, while politically engaged in the 2006 Palestinian Territories parliamentary election campaign, Hamas stated in its election manifesto that it was prepared to use \"armed resistance to end the occupation\" [339] Hamas has repeatedly justified its violence by arguing \"People under occupation have a right to resist that occupation\" [340] Hamas also argues its armed resistance only started after decades of Israeli occupation [340]\n\n\nAttacks on civilians\nHamas have committed massacres targeting Israeli civilians Hamas's most deadly suicide bombing was an attack on a Netanya hotel on March 27, 2002, in which 30 people were killed and 140 were wounded The attack has also been referred to as the Passover massacre since it took place on the first night of the Jewish festival of Passover at a Seder.\n\n\nRocket attacks on Israel\nHamas and other Palestinian armed groups have launched thousands of rockets into Israel since 2001, killing 15 civilians, wounding many more, and posing an ongoing threat to the nearly 800,000 Israeli civilians who live and work in the weapons' range Hamas officials have said that the rockets were aimed only at military targets, saying that civilian casualties were the \"accidental result\" of the weapons' poor quality According to Human Rights Watch, statements by Hamas leaders suggest that the purpose of the rocket attacks was indeed to strike civilians and civilian objects From January 2009, following Operation Cast Lead, Hamas largely stopped launching rocket attacks on Israel and has on at least two occasions arrested members of other groups who have launched rockets, \"showing that it has the ability to impose the law when it wants\" [363] In February 2010, Hamas issued a statement regretting any harm that may have befallen Israeli civilians as a result of Palestinian rocket attacks during the Gaza war It maintained that its rocket attacks had been aimed at Israeli military targets but lacked accuracy and hence sometimes hit civilian areas Israel responded that Hamas had boasted repeatedly of targeting and murdering civilians in the media [364]\n\n\nGuerrilla warfare\nHamas has made great use of guerrilla tactics in the Gaza Strip and to a lesser degree the West Bank [371] It has successfully adapted these techniques over the years since its inception According to a 2006 report by rival Fatah party, Hamas had smuggled between several hundred and 1,300 tons of advanced rockets, along with other weaponry, into Gaza [371]\n\n\nExtrajudicial killings of rivals\n\n\nTerrorist designation\nThe United States designated Hamas as a terrorist organisation in 1995, as did Canada in November 2002, [392] and the United Kingdom in November 2021 [59] In May 2021, the Organization of American States designated Hamas as a terrorist organisation [393] The European Union so designated Hamas's military wing in 2001 and, under US pressure, [394] designated Hamas in 2003 [395] Hamas challenged this decision, [396] which was upheld by the European Court of Justice in July 2017 [397] Japan [398] and New Zealand [399] have designated the military wing of Hamas as a terrorist organisation [400] The organisation is banned in Jordan [401] In late February 2024, New Zealand re-designated the entire Hamas organisation as a terror entity [402] In September 2024, Switzerland approved a draft law on to ban the group [403]\n\n\nCriticism\nAside from its use of political violence in pursuit of its goals, Hamas has been widely criticised for a variety of reasons, including the use of antisemitic hate speech by its representatives, frequent calls for the military destruction of Israel, its reported use of human shields [415] and child combatants as part of its military operations, its restriction of political freedoms within the Gaza Strip, and human rights abuses [citation needed]\n\n\nElectoral performance\nIn the 2006 Palestinian legislative election, the party won 44.45% of the vote, becoming the largest party of the  Legislative Council.\n\n\nLegislative Council\nIn the 2006 Palestinian legislative election, the party won 44.45% of the vote, becoming the largest party of the

policy of empowering Hamas in Gaza [419] [420] [421] [422] This policy was part of a strategy to sabotage a two-state solution by confining the Palestinian Authority to the West Bank and weakening it, and to demonstrate to the Israeli public and western governments that Israel has no partner for peace [423] [424] This criticism was leveled by several Israeli officials, including former prime minister Ehud Barak, and former head of Shin Bet security services Yuval Diskin [423] Saudi Arabia and the Palestinian Authority were also critical of Israel under Netanyahu allowing suitcases of Qatari money to be given to Hamas, [423] in exchange for maintaining the ceasefire [419] The Times of Israel reported after the Hamas attack that Netanyahu's policy to treat the Palestinian Authority as a burden and Hamas as an asset had \"blown up in our faces\" [419]\n\n\nIsraeli policy towards Hamas\nBenjamin Netanyahu had been Israel's prime minister for most of the two decades preceding the

also critical of Israel under Netanyahu allowing suitcases of Qatari money to be given to Hamas, [423] in exchange for maintaining the ceasefire [419] The Times of Israel reported after the Hamas attack that Netanyahu's policy to treat the Palestinian Authority as a burden and Hamas as an asset had \"blown up in our faces\" [419]\n\n\nPublic support\nA poll conducted in 2021 found that 53% of Palestinians believed Hamas was \"most deserving of representing and leading the Palestinian people\" Only 14% preferred Abbas's Fatah party [425] At the same time, a majority of Gazans also saw Hamas as corrupt, but were frightened to criticize the group [426] Polls conducted in September 2023 found that support for Hamas among Palestinians stood at around 27–31% [427]\n\n\nForeign relations\nAfter winning the Palestinian elections, Hamas leaders made multi-national diplomatic tours abroad In April 2006, Mahmoud al-Zahar (then foreign minister) visited Saudi Arabia, Syria, Kuwait, Bahrein, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Yemen, Libya, Algeria, Sudan and Egypt [433] He met the Saudi foreign minister Prince Faysal In Syria he held talks on the issue of Palestinians stuck on the Syrian-Iraqi border [clarification needed] He also stated that he unofficially met officials from Western Europe in Qatar who did not wish to be named [433] In May 2006, Hamas foreign minister visited Indonesia, Malaysia, the Sultanate of Brunei, Pakistan, China, Sri Lanka and Iran [433] The minister also participated in China–Arab States Cooperation Forum [434] Ismail Haniyeh in 2006 visited Egypt, Syria, Kuwait, Iran, Lebanon, Qatar and Saudi Arabia [435]\n\n\nQatar and Turkey\nAccording to Middle East experts, now Hamas has two firm allies: Qatar and Turkey Both give Hamas public and financial assistance estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars [27] Qatar has transferred more than $1.8 billion to Hamas [25] Shashank Joshi, senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, says that \"Qatar also hosts Hamas's political bureau which includes Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal.\" Meshaal also visits Turkey frequently to meet with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan [27] Erdogan has dedicated himself to breaking Hamas out of its political and economic seclusion On US television, Erdogan said in 2012 that \"I don't see Hamas as a terror organization Hamas is a political party.\" [436]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nBooks\n\n\nJournal articles\n\n\nOther\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en",

Palestinian Islamist organization that has been active in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank since the late 1980s. Hamas was founded in 1987 and has since become one of the dominant political forces in Palestine, with a strong military wing and a significant social and charitable presence.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe name \"Hamas\" is an acronym of the Arabic phrase حركة المقاومة الإسلامية or Ḥarakah al-Muqāwamah al-ʾIslāmiyyah, meaning \"Islamic Resistance Movement.\" The acronym is derived from the Arabic word for \"zeal\" or \"strength,\" which is also a common name in the Arab world.\n\n**History**\n\nHamas was established in 1987, allegedly with roots in Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood movement, which had been active in the Gaza Strip since the 1950s. The Brotherhood gained influence through a network of mosques and various charitable and social organizations. In the 1980s, it emerged as a powerful political force, challenging the influence of the PLO, whose Fatah faction it had played a core role in creating. In December 1987, the Brotherhood adopted a more nationalist and activist line under the name of Hamas.\n\n**Policies towards Israel and Palestine**\n\nHamas' policy towards Israel and Palestine has evolved over the years. Historically, Hamas envisioned a Palestinian state on all of the territory that belonged to the British Mandate for Palestine, from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea. In 2006, Hamas signed the Palestinian Prisoners' Document, which supports the quest for a Palestinian state along the 1967 borders. Hamas also signed the Cairo Declaration in 2005, which emphasized the goal of ending the Israeli occupation and establishing a Palestinian state.\n\n**Truce proposals**\n\nHamas has repeatedly offered Israel a hudna, an Arabic word for armistice, of varying durations. During the hudna, both parties would refrain from any violent attacks on each other. Hamas's spokesperson, Ahmed Yousef, said that a hudna is more than a ceasefire and obliges parties to use the period to seek a permanent, non-violent resolution to their differences.\n\n**Recognition of Israel**\n\nHamas' stance on recognizing Israel is debated among scholars. Hamas leaders have emphasized that they do not recognize Israel, but indicate they \"have a de facto acceptance of its presence.\" Some scholars believe that Hamas accepted the 1967 borders and thus acknowledged the existence of another entity on the other side, implicitly recognizing Israel.\n\n**Antisemitism**\n\nThe 1988 Hamas charter proclaims that jihad against Jews is required until Judgement Day. The charter attributes collective responsibility to Jews, not just Israelis, for various global issues, including both World Wars. More authors have characterized the vi", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Hamas\" following this outline:\n\n\nEtymology\nHamas is an acronym of the Arabic phrase حركة المقاومة الإسلامية or Ḥarakah al-Muqāwamah al-ʾIslāmiyyah, meaning \"Islamic Resistance Movement\" This acronym, HMS, was glossed in the 1988 Hamas Covenant [103] by the Arabic word ḥamās (حماس) which itself means \"zeal\", \"strength\", or \"bravery\" [104]\n\n\nHistory\nHamas was established in 1987, and allegedly has its origins in Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood movement, which had been active in the Gaza Strip since the 1950s and gained influence through a network of mosques and various charitable and social organizations Unlike other Palestinian factions, after the Israeli occupation of Gaza in 1967, the Brotherhood in Gaza refused to join the resistance boycott against Israel [105] In the 1980s, it emerged as a powerful political factor, challenging the influence of the PLO, whose Fatah faction it had played a core role in creating [105] In December 1987, the Brotherhood adopted a more nationalist and activist line under the name of Hamas [106] Hamas was initially discretely supported by Israel as a counter-balance to the secular PLO [107] During the 1990s and early 2000s, the organization conducted numerous suicide bombings and other attacks against Israel [108]\n\n\nPolicies towards Israel and Palestine\nHamas' policy towards Israel has evolved Historically, Hamas envisioned a Palestinian state on all of the territory that belonged to the British Mandate for Palestine (that is, from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea) [130] In 2006, Hamas signed the Palestinian Prisoners' Document which supports the quest for a Palestinian state along the 1967 borders [131] [132] This document also recognized authority of the President of the Palestinian National Authority to negotiate with Israel [132] Hamas also signed the Cairo Declaration in 2005, which emphasized the goal of ending the Israeli occupation and establishing a Palestinian state [76] On 2 May 2017, Khaled Mashal, chief of the Hamas Political Bureau, presented a new Charter, in which Hamas accepted the establishment of a Palestinian state \"on the basis of June 4, 1967\" (West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem) acceptable But the new Charter did not recognize Israel nor relinquish Palestinian claims to all of historical Palestine [77] Many scholars saw Hamas' acceptance of the 1967 borders as a tacit acceptance of another entity on the other side [133] [134] [135]while others state that Hamas retains the long-term objective of establishing one state in former Mandatory Palestine [84] [85]\n\n\nTruce proposals\nHamas has repeatedly offered Israel a hudna, Arabic word for armistice, of varying durations (50 years, [136] even a 100 years [81]) During the hudna both the Israelis and Palestinians would refrain from any violent attacks on the other Under Islamic international law, a hudna is a binding and the Qur'an prohibits its violation [137] Hamas's spokesperson, Ahmed Yousef, said that a \"hudna\" is more than a ceasefire and it \"obliges parties to use the period to seek a permanent, non-violent resolution to their differences.\" [138]\n\n\nRecognition of Israel\nWhether Hamas would recognize Israel is debated [146] [147] [148] Hamas leaders have emphasized they do not recognize Israel, [77] but indicate they \"have a de facto acceptance of its presence\" [149] According to some scholars, Hamas accepted the 1967 borders and thus acknowledged the existence of another entity on the other side, [150] implicitly recognizing Israel [134] and \"drop [ping] the call for the destruction of Israel from its manifesto.\" [135] Other scholars believe that Hamas retains the long-term objective of establishing one state in former Mandatory Palestine [84] [85]\n\n\nAntisemitism\nThe 1988 Hamas charter proclaims that jihad against Jews is required until Judgement Day [155] [156] The \"governing\" 1988 charter of Hamas was said, in 2018, to \"openly dedicate(s) Hamas to genocide against the Jewish people\", referring to the Hamas 1988 charter, article 7 [157] More authors have characterized the violent language against all Jews in the original Hamas charter as genocidal, [158] incitement to genocide, [159] [160] or antisemitic [161] [162] The charter attributes collective responsibility to Jews, not just Israelis, for various global issues, including both World Wars [163]\n\n\nEvolution of positions\nIn its early days, Hamas functioned as a social-religious charity center Its members armed themselves for the ongoing resistance against the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories, and in August 1988 published their first charter in which Hamas stated that \"Israel\" should be \"eliminated\" through a \"clash with the enemies\", a \"struggle against Zionism\" and \"conflict with Israel\" [169]: preamble, art 14, 15, 32  They wrote that 'Palestine', that is all of the territory that belonged to the British Mandate for Palestine (that is, from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea), [130] should be \"liberated\" from \"Zionism\" [169]: art 14  and transformed into an Islamic Waqf (Islamic charitable endowment) in which \"followers of all religions can coexist in security and safety\" [170]: art 6, 11  [171] Practically speaking, Hamas is and was at war with Israel's army (later also attacking Israeli civilians) since the spring of 1989, initially as part of the First Intifada, a general protest movement that gradually turned more riotous and violent.\n\n\n1988–1992 (first charter)\nIn its early days, Hamas functioned as a social-religious charity center Its members armed themselves for the ongoing resistance against the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories, and in August 1988 published their first charter in which Hamas stated that \"Israel\" should be \"eliminated\" through a \"clash with the enemies\", a \"struggle against Zionism\" and \"conflict with Israel\" [169]: preamble, art 14, 15, 32  They wrote that 'Palestine', that is all of the territory that belonged to the British Mandate for Palestine (that is, from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea), [130] should be \"liberated\" from \"Zionism\" [169]: art 14  and transformed into an Islamic Waqf (Islamic charitable endowment) in which \"followers of all religions can coexist in security and safety\" [170]: art 6, 11  [171] Practically speaking, Hamas is and was at war with Israel's army (later also attacking Israeli civilians) since the spring of 1989, initially as part of the First Intifada, a general protest movement that gradually turned more riotous and violent.\n\n\n1992–2005\nSheikh Ahmed Yassin, founder of Hamas, who died in 2004 (killed by Israel), has at unreported date offered Israel a ten-year hudna (truce, armistice) in return for establishment of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Yassin later added, the hudna could be renewed, even for longer periods, but would never signal a recognition of Israel [81]\n\n\n2006–2007: 1967 borders and a truce\nIn March 2006, after winning an absolute majority in the 2006 Palestinian legislative elections, Hamas published its government program in which Hamas claimed sovereignty for the Palestinian territories but did not repeat its claim to all of mandatory Palestine, instead declared their willingness to have contacts with Israel \"in all mundane affairs: business, trade, health, and labor\" [172] The program further stated: \"The question of recognizing Israel is not the jurisdiction of one faction, nor the government, but a decision for the Palestinian people.\" [173]\nSince then until today, spokesmen of Hamas seem to disagree about their attitudes towards Israel, and debates are running as to whether the original 1988 Hamas charter has since March 2006 become obsolete and irrelevant or on the contrary still spells out Hamas's genuine and ultimate goals (see: 1988 Hamas charter, § Relevance).\n\n\n2008–2016\nIn April 2008, former US President Jimmy Carter met with Khaled Mashal, the recognized Hamas leader since 2004 Mashal said to Carter, Hamas would \"accept a Palestinian state on the 1967 borders\" and accept the right of Israel \"to live as a neighbour\" if such a deal would be approved by a referendum among the \"Palestinians\" Nevertheless, Mashal did not offer a unilateral ceasefire (as Carter had suggested him to do) The US State Department showed utter indifference for Mashal's new stance; Israel's Prime Minister Ehud Olmert even refused to meet with Carter in Jerusalem, not to mention paying attention to the new Hamas stance [179]\n\n\n2017– 6 Oct. 2023 (new charter)\nOn 1 May 2017, in a press conference in Doha (Qatar) presenting a new charter, Khaled Mashal, chief of the Hamas Political Bureau (thus acknowledged as to be highest Hamas leader), declared that, though Hamas considered the establishment of a Palestinian state \"on the basis of June 4, 1967\" (West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem being not under Israeli reign) acceptable, Hamas would in that case still not recognise the statehood of Israel and not relinquish their goal of liberating all of Palestine from \"the Zionist project\" [77] [190]\n\n\n7 Oct. 2023–present\nIn a flash attack on 7 October 2023, Hamas and associates murdered 767 civilians and killed a further 376 security personnel of the state of Israel Israel retaliated with warfare in the Gaza Strip, aiming at Hamas militants but also harming much civilian infrastructure and directly killing tens of thousands of civilians, as admitted even by Israel (not counting the presumed multiple number of indirect deaths) A number of conflicting statements since then were made by Hamas senior leaders regarding the Hamas policy towards Israel.\n\n\nComments from non-Hamas-members\nThe vision that Hamas articulated in its original 1988 charter resembles the vision of certain Zionist groups regarding the same territory, as noted by several authors [185] [201] [202] This may suggest that Hamas's views were inspired by those Zionist perspectives [m] [204] [205]\n\n\nReligious policy\nThe gender ideology outlined in the Hamas charter, the importance of women in the religious-nationalist project of liberation is asserted as no lesser than that of males Their role was defined primarily as one of manufacturing males and caring for their upbringing and rearing, though the charter recognized they could fight for liberation without obtaining their husband's permission and in 2002 their participation in jihad was permitted [214] The doctrinal emphasis on childbearing and rearing as woman's primary duty is not so different from Fatah's view of women in the First Intifada and it also resembles the outlook of Jewish settlers, and over time it has been subjected to change [215] [216]\n\n\nGaza Strip\nThe gender ideology outlined in the Hamas charter, the importance of women in the religious-nationalist project of liberation is asserted as no lesser than that of males Their role was defined primarily as one of manufacturing males and caring for their upbringing and rearing, though the charter recognized they could fight for liberation without obtaining their husband's permission and in 2002 their participation in jihad was permitted [214] The doctrinal emphasis on childbearing and rearing as woman's primary duty is not so different from Fatah's view of women in the First Intifada and it also resembles the outlook of Jewish settlers, and over time it has been subjected to change [215] [216]\n\n\nIn the West Bank\nIn 2005, the human rights organization Freemuse released a report titled \"Palestine: Taliban-like attempts to censor music\", which said that Palestinian musicians feared that harsh religious laws against music and concerts will be imposed since Hamas group scored political gains in the Palestinian Authority local elections of 2005 [224]\n\n\nErdoğan's Turkey as a role model\nSome Hamas members have stated that the model of Islamic government that Hamas seeks to emulate is that of Turkey under the rule of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan The foremost members to distance Hamas from the practices of the Taliban and to publicly support the Erdoğan model were Ahmed Yousef and Ghazi Hamad, advisers to Prime Minister Hanieh [229] [230] Yusuf, the Hamas deputy foreign minister, reflected this goal in an interview with a Turkish newspaper, stating that while foreign public opinion equates Hamas with the Taliban or al-Qaeda, the analogy is inaccurate Yusuf described the Taliban as \"opposed to everything\", including education and women's rights, while Hamas wants to establish good relations between the religious and secular elements of society and strives for human rights, democracy and an open society [231] According to professor Yezid Sayigh of King's College in London, how influential this view is within Hamas is uncertain, since both Ahmad Yousef and Ghazi Hamad were dismissed from their posts as advisers to Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Hanieh in October 2007 [229] Both have since been appointed to other prominent positions within the Hamas government Khaled al-Hroub of the West Bank-based and anti-Hamas [232] Palestinian daily Al Ayyam added that despite claims by Hamas leaders that it wants to repeat the Turkish model of Islam, \"what is happening on the ground in reality is a replica of the Taliban model of Islam.\" [233] [234]\n\n\nCharter and policy documents\nHamas published its charter in August 1988, wherein it defined itself as a chapter of the Muslim Brotherhood and its desire to establish \"an Islamic state throughout Palestine\" [235] The foundational document was written by a single individual and made public without going through the usual prior consultation process [n] It was then signed on August 18, 1988 It compares Israeli attacks on civilians to that by Nazi Germany [237] The charter also claims all of historical Palestine [238] [239] [o] [241] but promises religious coexistence under Islam's rule [242]  [243] Article 6 states that the movement's aim is to \"raise the banner of Allah over every inch of Palestine, for under the wing of Islam followers of all religions can coexist in security and safety where their lives, possessions and rights are concerned\" [170] [244] The charter rejects a two-state solution, stating that the conflict cannot be resolved \"except through jihad\".\n\n\n1988 charter\nHamas published its charter in August 1988, wherein it defined itself as a chapter of the

stating that the conflict cannot be resolved \"except through jihad\".\n\n\n2017 document of principles\nIn May 2017, Hamas published a document titled \"A Document of General Principles and Policies\" While this policy document was much shorter than the 1988 charter, and Hamas leaders stated that it did not replace the 1988 charter, [248] it covers some of the same topics and is sometimes referred to in English as the \"2017 charter\"  It accepted a Palestinian state in the 1967 borders, without recognizing Israel, and argued that armed resistance to occupation is supported by international law [249] [250] [84] [155] [190] Hamas has described these changes as adaptation within a specific context, as opposed to abandonment of its principles [251]\n\n\nOrganization\nHamas inherited from its predecessor a tripartite structure that consisted in the provision of social services, of religious training and military operations under a Shura Council Traditionally it had four distinct functions: (a) a charitable social welfare division (dawah); (b) a military division for procuring weapons and undertaking operations (al-Mujahideen al Filastinun); (c) a security service (Jehaz Aman); and (d) a media branch (A'alam) [253] Hamas has both an internal leadership within the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and an external leadership, split between a Gaza group directed by Mousa Abu Marzook from his exile first in Damascus and then in Egypt, and a Kuwaiti group (Kuwaidia) under Khaled Mashal [254] [needs update] The Kuwaiti group of Palestinian exiles began to receive extensive funding from the Gulf States after its leader Mashal broke with Yasser Arafat's decision to side with Saddam Hussein in the Invasion of Kuwait, with Mashal insisting that Iraq withdraw [255] On May 6, 2017, Hamas' Shura Council chose Ismail Haniyeh to become the new leader, to replace Mashal [256]\n\n\nLeadership and structure\nHamas inherited from its predecessor a tripartite structure

Haniyeh to become the new leader, to replace Mashal [256]\n\n\nShura Council and Political Bureau\nHamas's overarching governing body is the Majlis al-Shura (Shura Council), based on the Quranic concept of consultation and popular assembly (shura), which Hamas leaders argue provides for democracy within an Islamic framework [258] As the organization grew more complex and Israeli pressure increased, the Shura Council was renamed the General Consultative Council, with members elected from local council groups The council elects the 15-member Political Bureau (al-Maktab al-Siyasi) [259] that makes decisions for Hamas Representatives come from Gaza, the West Bank, leaders in exile and Israeli prisons [260] The Political Bureau was based in Damascus until January 2012, when Hamas's support for the Syrian opposition to Bashar al-Assad during the Syrian civil war led to the office's relocation to Qatar [260] [261]\n\n\nFinances and funding\nHamas, like its predecessor the Muslim Brotherhood, assumed the administration of Gaza's waqf properties, endowments which extend over 10% of all real estate in the Gaza Strip, with 2,000 acres of agricultural land held in religious trusts, together with numerous shops, rentable apartments and public buildings [262]\n\n\nSocial services wing\nHamas developed its social welfare programme by replicating the model established by Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood For Hamas, charity and the development of one's community are both prescribed by religion and to be understood as forms of resistance [284] In Islamic tradition, dawah (lit. transl. \"the call to God\") obliges the faithful to reach out to others by both proselytising and by charitable works, and typically the latter centre on the mosques which make use of both waqf endowment resources and charitable donations (zakat, one of the five pillars of Islam) to fund grassroots services such as nurseries, schools, orphanages, soup kitchens, women's activities, library services and even sporting clubs within a larger context of preaching and political discussions [285] In the 1990s, some 85% of its budget was allocated to the provision of social services [286] Hamas has been called perhaps the most significant social services actor in Palestine By 2000, Hamas or its affiliated charities ran roughly 40% of the social institutions in the West Bank and Gaza and, with other Islamic charities, by 2005, was supporting 120,000 individuals with monthly financial support in Gaza [287] Part of the appeal of these institutions is that they fill a vacuum in the administration by the PLO of the Palestinian territories, which had failed to cater to the demand for jobs and broad social services, and is widely viewed as corrupt [288] As late as 2005, the budget of Hamas, drawing on global charity contributions, was mostly tied up in covering running expenses for its social programmes, which extended from the supply of housing, food and water for the needy to more general functions such as financial aid, medical assistance, educational development and religious instruction A certain accounting flexibility allowed these funds to cover both charitable causes and military operations, permitting transfer from one to the other [289]\n\n\nMilitary wing\nThe Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades is Hamas' military wing [297] [298] While the number of members is known only to the Brigades leadership, Israel estimates the Brigades have a core of several hundred members who receive military style training, including training in Iran and in Syria (before the Syrian Civil War) [299] Additionally, the brigades have an estimated 10,000–17,000 operatives, [287] [300] other sources say 15,000–40,000 militants, [301] [302] [undue weight? – discuss] forming a backup force whenever circumstances call for reinforcements for the Brigade Recruitment training lasts for two years [299] The group's ideology outlines its aim as the liberation of Palestine and the restoration of Palestinian rights under the dispensations set forth in the Qur'an, and this translates into three policy priorities:\n\n\nGaza forces, October 2023\nDuring the 2023 Gaza war, the IDF published its intelligence about the Hamas military in the Strip [316] They put the strength of the Qassam Brigades there at the start of the war at 30,000 fighters, organised by area in five brigades, consisting in total of 24 battalions and c 140 companies [316] Each regional brigade had a number of strongholds and outposts, and included specialised arrays for rocket firing, anti-tank missiles, air defenses, snipers, and engineering [316]\n\n\nMedia\nAl-Aqsa TV is a television channel founded by Hamas [317] The station began broadcasting in the Gaza Strip on January 9, 2006, [318] [319] less than three weeks before the Palestinian legislative elections It has shown television programs, including some children's television, which deliver antisemitic messages [320] Hamas has stated that the television station is \"an independent media institution that often does not express the views of the Palestinian government headed by Ismail Haniyeh or of the Hamas movement\", and that Hamas does not hold antisemitic views [321] The programming includes ideologically tinged children's shows, news talk, and religiously inspired entertainment [322] According to the Anti-Defamation League, the station promotes terrorist activity and incites hatred of Jews and Israelis [319] Al-Aqsa TV is headed by the controversial Fathi Ahmad Hammad, chairman of al-Ribat Communications and Artistic Productions—a Hamas-run company that also produces Hamas's radio station, Voice of al-Aqsa, and its biweekly newspaper, The Message [323] Hamad has made a number of controversial comments, including a speech in which he reportedly stated: 'you have Jews everywhere and we must attack every Jew on the globe by way of slaughtering and killing'  [324]\n\n\nAl-Aqsa

'you have Jews everywhere and we must attack every Jew on the globe by way of slaughtering and killing'  [324]\n\n\nAl-Fateh magazine\nAl-Fateh (\"the conqueror\") is the Hamas children's magazine, published biweekly in London, and also posted in an online website It began publication in September 2002, and its 108th issue was released in mid-September 2007 The magazine features stories, poems, riddles, and puzzles, and states it is for \"the young builders of the future\" [325]\n\n\nSocial media\nHamas has traditionally presented itself as a voice of suffering of the Palestinian people According to Time magazine, a new social media strategy was employed in the wake of the October 7 attack: Hamas asserted itself as the dominant resistance force in the Middle East by recording and broadcasting the brutality of their attacks [327]\n\n\nInternal security\nThe General Security Service, formally part of the Hamas political party, operates akin to a governmental body within Gaza Under the direct oversight of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, it conducts extensive surveillance on Palestinians, compiling files on various individuals including journalists and government critics This secret police force relies on a network of informants and employs tactics such as censorship and surveillance to maintain control Before the conflict with Israel, the unit reportedly had a monthly budget of $120,000 and consisted of 856 personnel, including more than 160 individuals paid to spread Hamas propaganda and conduct online attacks against opponents [330]\n\n\nSymbols\nThe flag of Hamas is a green field (a traditionally respected color in Islam) charged in the middle with the writing of the Shahada, an Islamic statement of faith, in white calligraphic script: \"There is no god but God\" and \"Muhammad is the messenger of God\" [331] [332]\n\n\nViolence\nHamas has used both political activities and violence in pursuit of its goals For example, while politically engaged in the 2006 Palestinian Territories parliamentary election campaign, Hamas stated in its election manifesto that it was prepared to use \"armed resistance to end the occupation\" [339] Hamas has repeatedly justified its violence by arguing \"People under occupation have a right to resist that occupation\" [340] Hamas also argues its armed resistance only started after decades of Israeli occupation [340]\n\n\nAttacks on civilians\nHamas have committed massacres targeting Israeli civilians Hamas's most deadly suicide bombing was an attack on a Netanya hotel on March 27, 2002, in which 30 people were killed and 140 were wounded The attack has also been referred to as the Passover massacre since it took place on the first night of the Jewish festival of Passover at a Seder.\n\n\nRocket attacks on Israel\nHamas and other Palestinian armed groups have launched thousands of rockets into Israel since 2001, killing 15 civilians, wounding many more, and posing an ongoing threat to the nearly 800,000 Israeli civilians who live and work in the weapons' range Hamas officials have said that the rockets were aimed only at military targets, saying that civilian casualties were the \"accidental result\" of the weapons' poor quality According to Human Rights Watch, statements by Hamas leaders suggest that the purpose of the rocket attacks was indeed to strike civilians and civilian objects From January 2009, following Operation Cast Lead, Hamas largely stopped launching rocket attacks on Israel and has on at least two occasions arrested members of other groups who have launched rockets, \"showing that it has the ability to impose the law when it wants\" [363] In February 2010, Hamas issued a statement regretting any harm that may have befallen Israeli civilians as a result of Palestinian rocket attacks during the Gaza war It maintained that its rocket attacks had been aimed at Israeli military targets but lacked accuracy and hence sometimes hit civilian areas Israel responded that Hamas had boasted repeatedly of targeting and murdering civilians in the media [364]\n\n\nGuerrilla warfare\nHamas has made great use of guerrilla tactics in the Gaza Strip and to a lesser degree the West Bank [371] It has successfully adapted these techniques over the years since its inception According to a 2006 report by rival Fatah party, Hamas had smuggled between several hundred and 1,300 tons of advanced rockets, along with other weaponry, into Gaza [371]\n\n\nExtrajudicial killings of rivals\n\n\nTerrorist designation\nThe United States designated Hamas as a terrorist organisation in 1995, as did Canada in November 2002, [392] and the United Kingdom in November 2021 [59] In May 2021, the Organization of American States designated Hamas as a terrorist organisation [393] The European Union so designated Hamas's military wing in 2001 and, under US pressure, [394] designated Hamas in 2003 [395] Hamas challenged this decision, [396] which was upheld by the European Court of Justice in July 2017 [397] Japan [398] and New Zealand [399] have designated the military wing of Hamas as a terrorist organisation [400] The organisation is banned in Jordan [401] In late February 2024, New Zealand re-designated the entire Hamas organisation as a terror entity [402] In September 2024, Switzerland approved a draft law on to ban the group [403]\n\n\nCriticism\nAside from its use of political violence in pursuit of its goals, Hamas has been widely criticised for a variety of reasons, including the use of antisemitic hate speech by its representatives, frequent calls for the military destruction of Israel, its reported use of human shields [415] and child combatants as part of its military operations, its restriction of political freedoms within the Gaza Strip, and human rights abuses [citation needed]\n\n\nElectoral performance\nIn the 2006 Palestinian legislative election, the party won 44.45% of the vote, becoming the largest party of the  Legislative Council.\n\n\nLegislative Council\nIn the 2006 Palestinian legislative election, the party won 44.45% of the vote, becoming the largest party of the  Legislative Council.\n\n\nSupport\nBenjamin Netanyahu had been Israel's prime minister for most of the two decades preceding the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, and was criticized for having championed a policy of empowering Hamas in Gaza [419] [420] [421] [422] This policy was part of a strategy to sabotage a two-state solution by confining the Palestinian Authority to the West Bank and weakening it, and to demonstrate to the Israeli public and western governments that Israel has no partner for peace [423] [424] This criticism was leveled by several Israeli officials, including former prime minister Ehud Barak, and former head of Shin Bet security services Yuval Diskin [423] Saudi Arabia and the Palestinian Authority were also critical of Israel under Netanyahu allowing suitcases of Qatari money to be given to Hamas, [423] in exchange for maintaining the ceasefire [419] The Times of Israel reported after the Hamas attack that Netanyahu's policy to treat the Palestinian Authority as a burden and Hamas as an asset had \"blown up in our faces\" [419]\n\n\nIsraeli policy towards Hamas\nBenjamin Netanyahu had been Israel's prime minister for most of the two decades preceding the

attack that Netanyahu's policy to treat the Palestinian Authority as a burden and Hamas as an asset had \"blown up in our faces\" [419]\n\n\nPublic support\nA poll conducted in 2021 found that 53% of Palestinians believed Hamas was \"most deserving of representing and leading the Palestinian people\" Only 14% preferred Abbas's Fatah party [425] At the same time, a majority of Gazans also saw Hamas as corrupt, but were frightened to criticize the group [426] Polls conducted in September 2023 found that support for Hamas among Palestinians stood at around 27–31% [427]\n\n\nForeign relations\nAfter winning the Palestinian elections, Hamas leaders made multi-national diplomatic tours abroad In April 2006, Mahmoud al-Zahar (then foreign minister) visited Saudi Arabia, Syria, Kuwait, Bahrein, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Yemen, Libya, Algeria, Sudan and Egypt [433] He met the Saudi foreign minister Prince Faysal In Syria he held talks on the issue of Palestinians stuck on the Syrian-Iraqi border [clarification needed] He also stated that he unofficially met officials from Western Europe in Qatar who did not wish to be named [433] In May 2006, Hamas foreign minister visited Indonesia, Malaysia, the Sultanate of Brunei, Pakistan, China, Sri Lanka and Iran [433] The minister also participated in China–Arab States Cooperation Forum [434] Ismail Haniyeh in 2006 visited Egypt, Syria, Kuwait, Iran, Lebanon, Qatar and Saudi Arabia [435]\n\n\nQatar and Turkey\nAccording to Middle East experts, now Hamas has two firm allies: Qatar and Turkey Both give Hamas public and financial assistance estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars [27] Qatar has transferred more than $1.8 billion to Hamas [25] Shashank Joshi, senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, says that \"Qatar also hosts Hamas's political bureau which includes Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal.\" Meshaal also visits Turkey frequently to meet with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan [27] Erdogan has dedicated himself to breaking Hamas out of its political and economic seclusion On US television, Erdogan said in 2012 that \"I don't see Hamas as a terror organization Hamas is a political party.\" [436]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nBooks\n\n\nJournal articles\n\n\nOther\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

[46]\n\n\nPusher escape motor\nThe company partnered with Aerojet Rocketdyne to develop a pusher launch escape system for the New Shepard suborbital crew capsule Aerojet Rocketdyne provides the Crew Capsule Escape Solid Rocket Motor (CCE SRM) while the thrust vector control system that steers the capsule during an abort is designed and manufactured by Blue Origin [47] [48]\n\n\nFacilities\nThe company has facilities across the United States which include five main locations and five field offices: [49]\n\n\nLaunch Site One (LSO)\nCorn Ranch, commonly referred to as Launch Site One (LSO) is the company's launch site 30 miles north of Van Horn, Texas [54] The launch facility is located at 31.422927°N 104.757152°W [55]\n\n\nBlue Engine\nEngine production is located in Huntsville, Alabama, at a 600,000 square foot facility called, \"Blue Engine\" The companies website states that, \"The world-class engine manufacturing facility in The Rocket City conduct [s] high rate production of the BE-4 and BE-3U engines \n\n\nOrbital Launch Site (OLS)\nThe Orbital Launch Site (OLS) at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, develops rockets and conducts extensive testing The company converted

station The project is envisioned as an expandable business park, with Boeing's Starliner and Sierra Space's Dream Chaser transporting passengers to and from low Earth orbit (LEO) for tourism, research and in-space manufacturing projects [62]\n\n\nNuclear rocket program\nNASA plans to test spacecraft, engines and other propellent systems powered by nuclear fission no later than 2027 as part of the agency's effort to demonstrate more efficient methods of traveling through outer space for space exploration [65] One benefit to using nuclear fission as a propellent for spacecraft is that nuclear-based systems can have less mass than solar cells which means a spacecraft could be smaller while using the same amount of energy more efficiently Nuclear fission concepts that can power both life support and propulsion systems could greatly reduce the cost and flight time during space exploration [66]\n\n\nSpace Technology\nNASA awarded $35 million to the company in 2023 for the company's work on lunar regolith to be used for solar powered systems on the moon The company's website states that \"Blue Alchemist is a proposed end-to-end, scalable, autonomous, and commercial solution that produces solar cells from lunar regolith, which is the dust and crushed rock abundant on the surface of the Moon Based on a process called molten regolith electrolysis, the breakthrough would bootstrap unlimited electricity and power transmission cables anywhere on the surface of the Moon This process also produces oxygen as a useful byproduct for propulsion and life support.\"\n\n\nBlue Origin flight data\nIn the chart below, ♺ means \"Flight Proven Booster\"\n\n\nNASA partnerships and funding\nThe company has contracted to do work for NASA on several development efforts The company was awarded $3.7 million in funding by NASA in 2009 via a Space Act Agreement [104] [105] under the first Commercial Crew Development (CCDev) program for development of concepts and technologies to support future human spaceflight operations [106] [107] NASA co-funded risk-mitigation activities related to ground testing of (1) an innovative 'pusher' escape system, that lowers cost by being reusable and enhances safety by avoiding the jettison event of a traditional 'tractor' Launch Escape System, and (2) an innovative composite pressure vessel cabin that both reduces weight and increases safety of astronauts [104] This was later revealed to be a part of a larger system, designed for a bionic capsule, that would be launched atop an Atlas V rocket [108] On November 8, 2010, it was announced that the company had completed all milestones under its CCDev Space Act Agreement [109]\n\n\nInternal and additional U.S Government funding\nBy July 2014, Jeff Bezos had invested over $500 million into the company [122] and the vast majority of further funding into 2016 was to support technology development and operations where a majority of funding came from Jeff Bezos' private investment fund In April 2017, an annual amount was published showing that Jeff Bezos was selling approximately $1 billion in Amazon stock per year to invest in the company [123] Jeff Bezos has been criticized for spending excessive amounts of his fortune on spaceflight [124]\n\n\nEarly test vehicles\nThe company's first flight test vehicle, called Charon after Pluto's moon, [128] was powered by four vertically mounted Rolls-Royce Viper Mk 301 jet engines rather than rockets The low-altitude vehicle was developed to test autonomous guidance and control technologies, and the processes that the company would use to develop its later rockets Charon made its only test flight at Moses Lake, Washington on March 5, 2005 It flew to an altitude of 96 m (316 ft) before returning for a controlled landing near the liftoff point [129] [130] As of 2016, Charon is on display at the Museum of Flight in Seattle, Washington [131]\n\n\nCharon\nThe company's first flight test vehicle, called Charon

vehicle, named Goddard (also known as PM1), first flew on November 13, 2006 The flight was successful A test flight for December 2 never launched [132] [133] According to Federal Aviation Administration records, two further flights were performed by Goddard [134] Blue Engine 1, or BE-1, was the first rocket engine developed by the company and was used in the company's Goddard development vehicle.\n\n\nPM2\nAnother early suborbital test vehicle, PM2, had two flight tests in 2011 in west Texas The vehicle designation may be short for \"Propulsion Module\" [135] The first flight was a short hop (low altitude, VTVL takeoff and landing mission) flown on May 6, 2011 The second flight, August 24, 2011, failed when ground personnel lost contact and control of the vehicle The company released its analysis of the failure nine days later As the vehicle reached a speed of Mach 1.2 and 14 km (46,000 ft) altitude, a \"flight instability drove an angle of attack that triggered  [the] range safety system to terminate thrust on the vehicle\" The vehicle was lost [136] Blue Engine 2, or BE-2, was a pump-fed bipropellant engine burning kerosene and peroxide which produced 140 kN (31,000 lbf) of thrust [137] [138] Five BE-2 engines powered the company's PM-2 development vehicle on two test flights in 2011 [139]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal

United States which include five main locations and five field offices: [49]\n\n\nLaunch Site One (LSO)\nCorn Ranch, commonly referred to as Launch Site One (LSO) is the company's launch site 30 miles north of Van Horn, Texas [54] The launch facility is located at 31.422927°N 104.757152°W [55]\n\n\nBlue Engine\nEngine production is located in Huntsville, Alabama, at a 600,000 square foot facility called, \"Blue Engine\" The companies website states that, \"The world-class engine manufacturing facility in The Rocket City conduct [s] high rate production of the BE-4 and BE-3U engines \n\n\nOrbital Launch Site (OLS)\nThe Orbital Launch Site (OLS) at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, develops rockets and conducts extensive testing The company converted Launch Complex 36 (LC-36) to launch New Glenn into orbit [57] at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station The facility was initially completed in 2020 and is being used for the construction of New Glenn prototypes, rocket testing, and designs [58]\n\n\nOther projects\nThe Blue Ring vehicle was announced in October 2023 by Blue Origin It will have its own engine and is meant to handle orbital logistics and delivery In March 2024, in partnership with the United States Space Force, it was announced that the Blue Ring’s capabilities will be tested soon on a mission called DarkSky-1 [61]\n\n\nBlue Ring (Space Truck Vehicle)\nThe Blue Ring vehicle was announced in October 2023 by Blue Origin It will have its own engine and is meant to handle orbital logistics and delivery In March 2024, in partnership with the United States Space Force, it was announced that the Blue Ring’s capabilities will be tested soon on a mission called DarkSky-1 [61]\n\n\nOrbital Reef (commercial space station)\nThe company and its partners Sierra Space, Boeing, Redwire Space and Genesis Engineering Solutions won a $130 million award to jump-start the design of their Orbital Reef commercial space station The project is envisioned as an expandable business park, with Boeing's Starliner and Sierra Space's Dream Chaser transporting passengers to and from low Earth orbit (LEO) for tourism, research and in-space manufacturing projects [62]\n\n\nNuclear rocket program\nNASA plans to test spacecraft, engines and other propellent systems powered by nuclear fission no later than 2027 as part of the agency's effort to demonstrate more efficient methods of traveling through outer space for space exploration [65] One benefit to using nuclear fission as a propellent for spacecraft is that nuclear-based systems can have less mass than solar cells which means a spacecraft could be smaller while using the same amount of energy more efficiently Nuclear fission concepts that can power both life support and propulsion systems could greatly reduce the cost and flight time during space exploration [66]\n\n\nSpace Technology\nNASA awarded $35 million to the company in 2023 for the company's work on lunar regolith to be used for solar powered systems on the moon The company's website states that \"Blue Alchemist is a proposed end-to-end, scalable, autonomous, and commercial solution that produces solar cells from lunar regolith, which is the dust and crushed rock abundant on the surface of the Moon Based on a process called molten regolith electrolysis, the breakthrough would bootstrap unlimited electricity and power transmission cables anywhere on the surface of the Moon This process also produces oxygen as a useful byproduct for propulsion and life support.\"\n\n\nBlue Origin flight data\nIn the chart below, ♺ means \"Flight Proven Booster\"\n\n\nNASA partnerships and funding\nThe company has contracted to do work for NASA on several development efforts The company was awarded $3.7 million in funding by NASA in 2009 via a Space Act Agreement [104] [105] under the first Commercial Crew Development (CCDev) program for development of concepts and technologies to support future human spaceflight operations [106] [107] NASA co-funded risk-mitigation activities related to ground testing of (1) an innovative 'pusher' escape system, that lowers cost by being reusable and enhances safety by avoiding the jettison event of a traditional 'tractor' Launch Escape System, and (2) an innovative composite pressure vessel cabin that both reduces weight and increases safety of astronauts [104] This was later revealed to be a part of a larger system, designed for a bionic capsule, that would be launched atop an Atlas V rocket [108] On November 8, 2010, it was announced that the company had completed all milestones under its CCDev Space Act Agreement [109]\n\n\nInternal and additional U.S Government funding\nBy July 2014, Jeff Bezos had invested over $500 million into the company [122] and the vast majority of further funding into 2016 was to support technology development and operations where a majority of funding came from Jeff Bezos' private investment fund In April 2017, an annual amount was published showing that Jeff Bezos was selling approximately $1 billion in Amazon stock per year to invest in the company [123] Jeff Bezos has been criticized for spending excessive amounts of his fortune on spaceflight [124]\n\n\nEarly test vehicles\nThe company's first flight test vehicle, called Charon after Pluto's moon, [128] was powered by four vertically mounted Rolls-Royce Viper Mk 301 jet engines rather than rockets The low-altitude vehicle was developed to test autonomous guidance and control technologies, and the processes that the company would use to develop its later rockets Charon made its only test flight at Moses Lake, Washington on March 5, 2005 It flew to an altitude of 96 m (316 ft) before returning for a controlled landing near the liftoff point [129] [130] As of 2016, Charon is on display at the Museum of Flight in Seattle, Washington [131]\n\n\nCharon\nThe company's first flight test vehicle, called Charon

vehicle, named Goddard (also known as PM1), first flew on November 13, 2006 The flight was successful A test flight for December 2 never launched [132] [133] According to Federal Aviation Administration records, two further flights were performed by Goddard [134] Blue Engine 1, or BE-1, was the first rocket engine developed by the company and was used in the company's Goddard development vehicle.\n\n\nPM2\nAnother early suborbital test vehicle, PM2, had two flight tests in 2011 in west Texas The vehicle designation may be short for \"Propulsion Module\" [135] The first flight was a short hop (low altitude, VTVL takeoff and landing mission) flown on May 6, 2011 The second flight, August 24, 2011, failed when ground personnel lost contact and control of the vehicle The company released its analysis of the failure nine days later As the vehicle reached a speed of Mach 1.2 and 14 km (46,000 ft) altitude, a \"flight instability drove an angle of attack that triggered  [the] range safety system to terminate thrust on the vehicle\" The vehicle was lost [136] Blue Engine 2, or BE-2, was a pump-fed bipropellant engine burning kerosene and peroxide which produced 140 kN (31,000 lbf) of thrust [137] [138] Five BE-2 engines powered the company's PM-2 development vehicle on two test flights in 2011 [139]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal

The film stars Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Oliver Reed, and Richard Harris. The screenplay was written by David Franzoni, John Logan, and William Nicholson, and was inspired by a 1958 novel of the same name by Daniel P. Mannix.\n\n**Plot**\n\nIn 180 CE, the Roman general Maximus Decimus Meridius intends to return home after he leads the Roman army to victory against Germanic tribes near Vindobona. Emperor Marcus Aurelius tells Maximus that his own son, Commodus, is unfit to rule and that he wishes Maximus to succeed him, as regent, to restore the Roman Republic. Angered by this decision, Commodus secretly murders his father.\n\nMaximus is betrayed and enslaved by Commodus, who orders him to fight in the Roman Colosseum as a gladiator. Maximus becomes a popular gladiator, known as \"The Spanish Fighter,\" and is trained by Proximo, a grizzled gladiatorial trainer. Maximus's skills in the arena attract the attention of the Roman people, who begin to see him as a hero.\n\nAs Maximus's fame grows, he becomes embroiled in a plot to overthrow Commodus, who is revealed to be a tyrannical and insane ruler. Maximus teams up with his fellow gladiators, including the treacherous and cunning gladiator, Juba, to take down Commodus and restore the Roman Republic.\n\n**Cast**\n\nThe film features an all-star cast, including:\n\n* Russell Crowe as Maximus Decimus Meridius\n* Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus\n* Connie Nielsen as Lucilla\n* Oliver Reed as Proximo\n* Richard Harris as Marcus Aurelius\n* Djimon Hounsou as Juba\n* David Hemmings as Quintus\n* Tomas Arana as Gracchus\n* John Shrapnel as Cassius\n* Ralf Möller as Hagen\n\n**Production**\n\nThe film was shot at three main locations between January and May 1999. The opening battle scene was shot at Bourne Wood, near Farnham, Surrey, in England. The scenes of slavery, desert travel, and the gladiatorial training school were shot in Ouarzazate, Morocco. The scenes set in Rome were shot in Malta, where the crew built a replica of about one-third of the Colosseum to a height of 52 feet (16 meters).\n\nThe film was produced by Douglas Wick and David Franzoni, with a budget of $103 million. The film was edited by Pietro Scalia and had a runtime of 154 minutes.\n\n**Script complaints and revisions**\n\nAlthough the script was completed in October 1998, Crowe has claimed that the script was \"substantially underdone\" when filming began three months later. The script was constantly changing throughout principal photography, with Scott soliciting input from writers, producers, and actors. Some dialogue was created on the spot, such as Commodus's line \"Am I not merciful?\", which was ad-libbed by Phoenix.\n\n**Music**\n\nThe musical score for Gladiator was composed by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard, and conducted by Gavin Greenaway.

Polanski has been a fugitive from American justice since 1978, after fleeing the country just hours before he was due to be sent", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Will_Smith–Chris_Rock_slapping_incident\" following this outline:\n\n\nBackground\nJada Pinkett is an American actress who rose to fame in 1991 for her role in the television show A Different World In 1994, she met Will Smith on the set of Smith's television show The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air; the pair married in 1997, and she changed her name to Jada Pinkett Smith [1] [2]\n\n\nIncident\nRock announced the nominees for Best Documentary Feature at the 94th Academy Awards, where he performed a brief monologue largely read from a teleprompter script Rock joked about husband and wife Javier Bardem and Penélope Cruz, both previous Oscar winners receiving comparable nominations at that ceremony Smith and Pinkett Smith were seated together near the front of the audience Rock then made a comment about Pinkett Smith's shaved head, [13] making a comparison to Demi Moore's dramatic look in the 1997 film G.I Jane.\n\n\nPhotograph\nPhoto-journalist Brian Snyder, working for Reuters in the photographer pool in the projection booth, photographed Smith striking Rock [23] This photo quickly went viral, was featured in news stories, and was adapted into Internet memes [19] He was unaware of the photo's cultural impact until after the ceremony, as his photos are automatically sent to his editors [23] He was profiled by multiple media outlets, [24] [25] [26] including photography outlet PetaPixel [27] Another described him as \"The One Winner In The Will Smith vs Chris Rock 'Smackdown'\", speculating that \"Surely, Snyder will now win the most coveted and prestigious photojournalism award, the World Press Photo of the Year, thanks to his photo that captured the moment Smith hit Rock, as his photo has been used by every publication under the sun.\" [28]\n\n\nUncensored viewership\nIn the United States, broadcaster ABC muted Rock's and Smith's expletives due to federal censorship laws However, many international broadcasters chose not to, and uncensored recordings of the event went viral on social media [29] The uncensored excerpt from the Australian broadcast on the Seven Network was posted by The Guardian on YouTube [17] and received over 50 million views within 24 hours [30] It reached number one on YouTube's trending page within three hours in many countries, including the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.\n\n\nAdditional videos\nAdditional smartphone footage was published on March 31 from an audience member's perspective of the Smiths' table This seems to show the reaction of Pinkett Smith during and after the joke, as unamused and rolling her eyes during the joke but then seeming to laugh when Rock commented, \"Will Smith just smacked the shit out of me\" [31]\n\n\nAftermath\nImmediately after the incident, Rock continued his presentation for Best Documentary Feature, which was awarded to the crew of Summer of Soul Smith continued to participate in the ceremony and subsequent celebrations Some in attendance were surprised that no actions were taken [32] Within forty minutes, Smith was presented the award for Best Actor for his portrayal of Richard Williams in King Richard He focused his emotional speech on divine justification and his need to protect those around him: \"Love will make you do crazy things\", he said, and apologized to the Academy, the other nominees, and to Williams's daughters Venus and Serena, who were in attendance, [33] despite not outwardly apologizing to Rock Smith received a standing ovation [34] Anthony Hopkins, who then presented the Academy Award for Best Actress, directly addressed Smith's behavior and Best Actor speech within his own speech, stating, \"Will Smith said it all What more can be said? Let's have peace and love and quiet.\" [35]\n\n\nInitial response\nImmediately after the incident, Rock continued his presentation for Best Documentary Feature, which was awarded to the crew of Summer of Soul Smith continued to participate in the ceremony and subsequent celebrations Some in attendance were surprised that no actions were taken [32] Within forty minutes, Smith was presented the award for Best Actor for his portrayal of Richard Williams in King Richard He focused his emotional speech on divine justification and his need to protect those around him: \"Love will make you do crazy things\", he said, and apologized to the Academy, the other nominees, and to Williams's daughters Venus and Serena, who were in attendance, [33] despite not outwardly apologizing to Rock Smith received a standing ovation [34] Anthony Hopkins, who then presented the Academy Award for Best Actress, directly addressed Smith's behavior and Best Actor speech within his own speech, stating, \"Will Smith said it all What more can be said? Let's have peace and love and quiet.\" [35]\n\n\nPublic apologies\nFollowing public backlash, Smith issued a formal apology on Instagram and Facebook the next day [42] He referred to his behavior as \"unacceptable\" and \"inexcusable\", directly addressing Rock: \"I would like to publicly apologize to you, Chris I was out of line and I was wrong I am embarrassed and my actions were not indicative of the man I want to be There is no place for violence in a world of love and kindness.\" [42] [43] [44] Three days after the incident, Rock briefly mentioned the subject for the first time at a comedy show, saying that he was still processing it, but promised to talk about it in the future [45] He said that Smith had not contacted him personally, nor had they spoken since the ceremony [46] Claims on social media that Rock had apologized were debunked by fact-checkers [47] [48]\n\n\nFormal Academy review\nOn March 28, the day after the incident, AMPAS announced a formal review [50] The Academy's Board of Governors intended to explore further action and consequences in accordance with its bylaws, its standards of conduct, and with California law, scheduled for March 30 [51] [52] AMPAS President David Rubin and CEO Dawn Hudson issued a subsequent letter to Academy members, noting that the official process would take a few weeks [53] [54] The following day, Smith initiated a six-minute Zoom call with Rubin and Hudson, apologizing again for his actions The Board of Governors were not aware of the conversation when discussing disciplinary procedures the following day; one of the participants in the board meeting stated the lack of transparency was suspicious and showed lack of leadership [55]\n\n\nResignation and ban\nSmith preemptively resigned on April 1, 2022 AMPAS told him that he was likely to be expelled for a decade or more [59] [60] AMPAS announced it would continue disciplinary proceedings for violations of the Academy's Standards of Conduct, in advance of its next scheduled board meeting on April 18 [61] The AMPAS disciplinary meeting, originally scheduled for April 18, was reportedly intended to decide upon the issues unaddressed by Smith's resignation, including allowing him to retain his Best Actor Oscar for King Richard, allowing him to be invited by other members to future Academy Awards ceremonies, and allowing his nomination for future consideration while no longer a voting member of the Academy [62] [63] Variety further reported that Smith's other professional memberships, such as at SAG-AFTRA, would be informed of the AMPAS disciplinary review outcome for further evaluation [62]\n\n\nSmith film delayed\nIn June 2020, it was announced that Smith starred in Emancipation, directed by Antoine Fuqua, in which he portrays Peter, a runaway slave who outsmarts hunters and the Louisiana swamp on a journey to the Union Army [72] Apple Studios paid an estimated $120 million for the rights to the film, outbidding several other studios [73] However, by May 2022, the film's release was delayed to 2023, due to production issues, the controversy over Smith slapping Chris Rock, and an overcrowded film release schedule from Apple Studios [74] The film was eventually released in select theaters on December 2, 2022 before being released on Apple TV+ on December 9, 2022 [75] Receiving mixed reviews from critics, the film earned a low-end $3,000 to $4,000 per location in its limited theatrical run [75]\n\n\nLater responses\nSmith appeared as a guest on the November 29, 2022 episode of The Daily Show with Trevor Noah for his first public interview since the incident After discussing Smith's upcoming film role in Emancipation, Trevor Noah questioned Smith about his reflections since the incident Smith responded by saying, \"That was a horrific night, as you could imagine There's many nuances and complexities to it, but at the end of the day, I just lost it I guess what I would say is you just never know what someone's going through.\" [76] Chris Rock spoke out about Smith for the first time in his Netflix stand-up comedy special Selective Outrage in March 2023, making numerous jokes about the incident [77]\n\n\nReactions\nAn opinion poll from YouGov conducted the day after the ceremony found that 61% of Americans said that Smith's actions were unacceptable and 22% said they were acceptable [79] The Federal Communications Commission, which regulates U.S broadcasting, received 66 complaints about the incident [80]\n\n\nCrew of Summer of Soul\nMusician Questlove and film producers David Dinerstein, Robert Fyvolent, and Joseph Patel were on stage immediately after the incident to accept the Best Documentary Feature award for Summer of Soul, and some commenters opined that this award had been overshadowed by the incident [83] [84] [85] The distracted audience searched Twitter for information on Rock and Smith [16] Gabrielle Ulubay of Marie Claire wrote that Summer of Soul \"deserved to have its moment, and Questlove's touching speech and tribute to his parents deserved to have our full attention—but instead, the world kept its mind on Will Smith and Chris Rock and its eyes on Twitter\" [86]\n\n\nIndividuals\nReactions from celebrities who attended the Academy Awards varied In general, there was strong condemnation of Smith's violence and support for Rock, though some defended Smith's actions or refused to take sides Celebrities who sympathized with Smith include Jeremy Clarkson, [90] Bradley Cooper, [91] Tyrese Gibson, [92] Tiffany Haddish, [93] Kevin Hart, [94] Jameela Jamil, [95] Nicki Minaj, [96] [97] Tyler Perry, [98] Jon Voight, [99] and Denzel Washington [100] Celebrities who criticized Smith include Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, [101] Tim Allen, [102] Pedro Almodóvar, [103] Judd Apatow, [96] Thomas Haden Church, [104] Steve Coogan, [105] Kevin Costner, [106] Mia Farrow, [96] Kathy Griffin, [107] Mark Hamill, [107] Zoë Kravitz, [108] Mila Kunis, [109] John Leguizamo, [110] Seth MacFarlane, [111] Rosie O'Donnell, [112] Rob Reiner, [107] Paul Rodriguez, [113] Joe Rogan, [114] Amy Schumer, [115] Chevy Chase, [116] Howard Stern, [117] and Wanda Sykes [118]\n\n\nComedians\nThe incident both provided fodder for on-stage comedians and elicited serious reactions for off-stage ones Many comedians, including George Wallace and Kathy Griffin, spoke out about how the incident had worried them about potential future confrontations, and that they might be more careful about the topics of jokes going forward [123] [124] Howie Mandel connected the Rock and Chappelle incidents, stating, \"That  [slap] opened the floodgates You saw what happened at the Academy Awards, and I thought that .. violence triggers violence, and I think this is the beginning of the end for comedy\" [125]\n\n\nPoliticians\nPoliticians worldwide publicly discussed or took a position on the incident [140] [141] [142] Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, reflecting on his own marriage, said that he \"can understand\" the reason for Smith's actions, but \"that's not how you roll\" [143] In Canada, Alberta premier Jason Kenney drew criticism for using a meme of the incident to express his position on green energy policies [144] The New Zealand National Party used a meme of the incident to criticize the New Zealand Labour Party on Facebook, but it was swiftly deleted and disavowed by leader Christopher Luxon [145] Rishi Sunak, British Chancellor of the Exchequer at the time, compared himself to Will Smith, having recently had his wife Akshata Murty criticized over owning shares in a tech company based in Russia, but humorously remarked \"At least I didn't get up and slap anybody\" [146]\n\n\nAccusations of staging\nSome commentators suspected the altercation was a publicity stunt, due in part to waning viewership numbers for recent years David Griner from Adweek tweeted: \"A slow walk up, an open hand slap, no stagger, slow walk back with no scuffle and no security personnel stepping in? Feels absolutely staged for publicity\", and several others agreed [149] Rumors of the slap being staged were fueled by a version of the image that was digitally manipulated to create the illusion that Rock was wearing a cheek pad, which was then debunked [150] [151] Academy sources confirmed that the incident was not planned and that Rock's joke was ad-libbed [152]\n\n\nAlopecia awareness\nResearch revealed that Google searches for alopecia increased by 600 percent as people educated themselves on the condition, while Twitter engagement increased by over five million percent, showing that the incident prompted an influx in awareness and learning about alopecia [153]\n\n\nViews on criminality\nThe LAPD reported that Rock did not wish to file a police report Former Los Angeles County prosecutor Alan Jackson believed that charges would not be pursued so long as Rock did not participate [154]\n\n\nMemes\nThe public's reaction eventually morphed from shock to satire and meme \nMedia outlets referred to the altercation, from the shot heard round the world, as \"the slap heard around the world\" [16] [20] [21] [22] \nOthers referred to it as \"Slapgate\" [160] [161] [162]\nA few journalists preferred \"The Slappening\" [163] [164] [165]\nCountless Internet memes and parodies were created from the photo and video [19] [166] [167]\nThe photo was integrated into a mural on a remaining section of the Berlin Wall in Mauerpark [168]\n\n\nAnalysis\nMonica Hesse, author and columnist for The Washington Post, characterized the act of violence as a misguided attempt at chivalry [170] Glamour magazine's Ateh Jewel characterized it as \"a chivalrous act loaded with toxic masculinity\" [171] Duke University James B Duke Distinguished Professor of African and African American Studies, Mark Anthony Neal, commented that the incident reflected upon societal values related to perceptions of race and African American masculinity in American media [172]\n\n\nPotential causes\nMonica Hesse, author and columnist for The Washington Post, characterized the act of violence as a misguided attempt at chivalry [170] Glamour magazine's Ateh Jewel characterized it as \"a chivalrous act loaded with toxic masculinity\" [171] Duke University James B Duke Distinguished Professor of African and African American Studies, Mark Anthony Neal, commented that the incident reflected upon societal values related to perceptions of race and African American masculinity in American media [172]\n\n\nComparisons with historic Academy incidents\nIn a column for Glamour magazine, Jenny Singer contrasted the cases of Smith and French–Polish director Roman Polanski Polanski has been a fugitive from American justice since 1978, after fleeing the country just hours before he was due to be sentenced for drugging and raping a thirteen-year-old girl Singer observed that the Academy did not expel Polanski until forty years later, in the wake of the MeToo movement; and that, until his expulsion, the acting fraternity in Hollywood enthusiastically supported the director, including a standing ovation at the 2003 ceremony upon winning Best Director for The Pianist (2002) By contrast, Smith was banned after only two weeks [183]\n\n\nFinancial impact\nOlin Business School at the Washington University in St Louis professors Tim Solberg and Glenn MacDonald agreed that it was unlikely the incident would have significant financial impacts on the earnings power of either Smith or Rock, but could have negative impacts for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences organization Solberg said, \"The Academy itself may suffer damage if it does not take action. .. The two stars have their followings and the audience is segmented They will probably not have a drop in earnings as a result In that sense, their brand is not harmed financially.\" MacDonald agreed, observing, \"In entertainment, they often say there is no such thing as bad publicity.\" Solberg noted there could be a financial impact to Smith if the major film studios took action: \"While financially, the stars have their brand and their following, unless a studio boycotts or the public cancels Will Smith—a major box office star making money for the company—due to the public show of violence, he will maintain his financial draw even if his brand is tarnished.\" [186]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The conflicts began in the late 11th century and continued for nearly two centuries, with the Holy Land, specifically Jerusalem, being the primary focus of the Crusades. The period from 1095 to 1187 was marked by the First and Second Crusades, the rise and fall of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, and the emergence of powerful Muslim leaders such as Nur-ad-Din and Saladin.\n\n**The Growth of Islam**\n\nThe history of the Crusades begins with the advent of Christian pilgrimage to the Holy Land, combined with the rise of Islam and its subsequent conquest of Jerusalem. In the 7th century, Arab armies conquered the Persian Empire and quickly spread into North Africa, the Middle East, and the Iberian Peninsula. The Muslim conquest of Jerusalem in 638 CE marked a significant turning point in the history of the city, which had been a sacred site for Jews, Christians, and Muslims for centuries.\n\n**Origins of the Crusades**\n\nThe origins of the Crusades are traceable to the combination of increased popularity of Christian pilgrimage and aggressive behavior of the dominant Muslim populations of Fatimids in Egypt and the Seljuk Turks in the Levant. The Fatimids, a Shia Islamic dynasty, controlled much of the Middle East and North Africa, while the Seljuk Turks, a Sunni Muslim people, dominated the region of Anatolia. The Crusades were also influenced by the Byzantine Empire, which was struggling to maintain its control over the Holy Land.\n\n**The First Crusade**\n\nIn order to recover the Holy Land and aid the Byzantines in their fight against the Seljuks, the First Crusade was called for by Urban II at the Council of Clermont in 1095. The crusade was led by a coalition of European nobles, including Bohemond of Taranto, Tancred of Hauteville, and Godfrey of Bouillon. The Crusaders arrived in Constantinople in 1096 and began their march towards Jerusalem, capturing various cities and towns along the way. The capture of Jerusalem in 1099 marked the culmination of the First Crusade and the establishment of the Kingdom of Jerusalem.\n\n**The Kingdom of Jerusalem**\n\nThe Kingdom of Jerusalem was formed in 1099 and enjoyed relative success against the warring Seljuks and Fatimids in its early years. The kingdom was ruled by a series of kings, including Godfrey of Bouillon, Baldwin I, and Baldwin II. The kingdom's early success was due in part to the support of the Crusaders, who continued to arrive in the Holy Land throughout the 12th century. However, the kingdom's position was threatened by the emergence of the Zengid dynasty in the 12th century.\n\n**Zengi and the Fall of Edessa**\n\nIn 1094, the governor of Aleppo, Aq Sunqur al-Hajib, was beheaded by Tutush I for treason. His son Imad al-Din Zengi was raised by Kerbogha, the governor of Mosul, and would rise to challenge the Crusader states. Zengi's successful siege of Edessa in 1144 would both result in the Second Crusade and the eventual fall of the County of Edessa. The fall of Edessa marked a significant turning point in the history of the Crusades, as it exposed the vulnerability of the Crusader states to Muslim attack.\n\n**The Second Crusade**\n\nThe fall of Edessa in 1144 led to the Second Crusade, which would include French and German expeditions to the Holy Land, a campaign in Iberia (part of the Reconquista), and the Wendish Crusade (part of the Northern Crusades). The failure of the campaigns in the Holy Land would reverberate for decades, as the Crusaders were unable to retake Edessa or prevent the further expansion of Muslim power in the region.\n\n**The Reign of Nur-ad-Din**\n\nThe death of Zengi in 1146 gave rise to an even more powerful leader of the Zengid dynasty, his son Nur-ad-Din. Nur-ad-Din would come to dominate Syria and, to some extent, Egypt, and would pose a significant threat to the Crusader states. Nur-ad-Din's reign marked a significant turning point in the history of the Crusades, as he united the various Muslim factions in the region and began to challenge the power of the Crusaders.\n\n**The Rise of Saladin**\n\nSaladin was a Kurdish officer in Nur-ad-Din's army who would unite both Syria and Egypt under his rule, forming the Ayyubid dynasty that would threaten the very existence of the Franks in the Holy Land. Saladin's rise to power marked a significant turning point in the history of the Crusades, as he would eventually defeat the Crusaders at the Battle of Hattin and capture Jerusalem in 1187.\n\n**The Fall of Jerusalem**\n\nThe Ayyubid dynasty under Saladin began their attacks against the Kingdom of Jerusalem, eventually leading to the fall of Jerusalem in 1187. The fall of Jerusalem marked a significant turning point in the history of the Crusades, as it exposed the vulnerability of the Crusader states to Muslim attack and led to the Third Crusade.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nAs a result of his victory at Jerusalem, the rest of Palestine quickly fell to Saladin. Many in the kingdom fled to Tyre, and Saladin's subsequent attack at the Siege of Tyre beginning in November 1187 was unsuccessful. The siege of Belvoir Castle began the next month, and this stronghold of the Knights Hospitaller finally fell a year later. The Siege of Laodicea and the Siege of Sahyun Castle in July 1188 further solidified Saladin's gains. These gains were amplified by the Siege of al-Shughur and the Siege of Bourzey Castle in August 1188. The Siege of Safed in late 1188 then completed Saladin's conquest of the Holy Land. At the same time, the forces of Western Europe were mobilizing for the Third Crusade.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* First Crusade\n* Second Crusade\n* Third Crusade\n* Kingdom of Jerusalem\n* Ayyubid dynasty\n* Nur-ad-Din\n* Saladin\n* Zengid dynasty\n\n**References**\n\n* Historia Hierosolymitana\n* Gesta Francorum et aliorum Hierosolimitanorum\n* The Crusades: A Very Short Introduction\n* A History of the Crusades\n* The Oxford Illustrated History of the Crusades\n* The Crusades through Arab Eyes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Chronology_of_the_Crusades,_1095–1187\" following this outline:\n\n\nThe growth of Islam\nThe history of the Crusades begins with the advent of Christian pilgrimage to the Holy Land combined with the rise of Islam and its subsequent conquest of Jerusalem [2]\n\n\nOrigins of the Crusades\nOrigins of the Crusades are traceable to the combination of increased popularity of Christian pilgrimage and aggressive behavior of the dominant Muslim populations of Fatimids in Egypt and the Seljuk Turks in the Levant [33]\n\n\nThe First Crusade\nIn order to recover the Holy Land and aid the Byzantines in their fight against the Seljuks, the First Crusade was called for by Urban II at the Council of Clermont in 1095 and culminated with the capture of Jerusalem in 1099 [110]\n\n\nThe Kingdom of Jerusalem\nThe Kingdom of Jerusalem was formed in 1099 and enjoyed relative success against the warring Seljuks and Fatimids in its early years until the advent of the Zengids in 1127 [158]\n\n\nZengi and the fall of Edessa\nIn 1094, the governor of Aleppo, Aq Sunqur al-Hajib, was beheaded by Tutush I for treason His son Imad al-Din Zengi was raised by Kerbogha, the governor of Mosul, and would rise to challenge the Crusader states His successful Siege of Edessa would both result in the Second Crusade and the eventual fall of the County of Edessa [276]\n\n\nThe Second Crusade\nThe fall of Edessa in 1144 would lead to the Second Crusade which would include French and German expeditions to the Holy Land, a campaign in Iberia (part of the Reconquista) and the Wendish Crusade (part of the Northern Crusades) The failure of the campaigns in the Holy Land would reverberate for decades [330]\n\n\nThe Reign of Nūr-ad-Din\nThe death of Zengi in 1146 would give rise to an even more powered leader of the Zengid dynasty, his son Nūr-ad-Din who would come to dominate Syria and, to some extent, Egypt [369]\n\n\nThe Rise of Saladin\nSaladin was a Kurdish officer in Nūr-ad-Din's army who would unite both Syria and Egypt under his rule, forming the Ayyubid dynasty that would threaten the very existence of the Franks in the Holy Land [409]\n\n\nThe fall of Jerusalem\nThe Ayyubid dynasty under Saladin began their attacks against the Kingdom of Jerusalem, eventually leading to the fall of Jerusalem in 1187 [480]\n\n\nAftermath\nAs a result of his victory at Jerusalem, the rest of Palestine quickly fell to Saladin Many in the kingdom fled to Tyre, and Saladin's subsequent attack at the Siege of Tyre beginning in November 1187 was unsuccessful The siege of Belvoir Castle began the next month and this stronghold of the Knights Hospitaller finally fell a year later The Siege of Laodicea and the Siege of Sahyun Castle in July 1188 further solidified Saladin's gains These gains were amplified by the Siege of al-Shughur and the Siege of Bourzey Castle in August 1188 The Siege of Safed in late 1188 then completed Saladin's conquest of the Holy Land At the same time, the forces of Western Europe were mobilizing for the Third Crusade [480]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Bangladesh Quota Reform Movement**\n\nThe 2024 Bangladesh Quota Reform Movement was a student-led movement in Bangladesh that began in June 2024, with the primary goal of reforming the country's quota system in government jobs. The movement gained international attention due to the violent crackdown by the government, which resulted in numerous deaths and injuries.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe quota system in Bangladesh was established in 1972 to provide benefits to the children and grandchildren of freedom fighters who participated in the Bangladesh Liberation War. However, over the years, the system had become corrupt and was seen as unfair by many, as it gave preference to a select few over others. The High Court of Bangladesh ruled in favor of the quota system on June 5, 2024, which sparked widespread protests across the country.\n\n**Timeline**\n\n### Early Phase (5 June – 9 July)\n\nThe movement began on June 5, 2024, with students from various universities in Dhaka uniting to demand a quota reform movement. The students initially started with peaceful protests, but the movement gained momentum and became widespread. The government responded by imposing a curfew and deploying security forces to contain the protests.\n\n### Bangla Blockade and Chhatra League Attacks (10–17 July)\n\nOn July 10, 2024, a protest march commenced in front of the University of Dhaka library, passing by the Raju Memorial Sculpture, and culminating in the blockage of the Shahbagh intersection. Members of the law and order forces positioned barricades in front of the students. In the afternoon, it was known that the status quo had been given for four weeks in the ruling given by the High Court canceling the quota system. The Chief Justice asked the students to go back. Dhaka's transport system came to a standstill due to the blockade in various parts of Dhaka. Long-distance buses and trains were stopped due to the agitation.\n\n### Complete Shutdown (18–19 July)\n\nOn July 18, 2024, the Dhaka Metropolitan Police, in an attempt to hinder the students' protests, announced the indefinite suspension of public gatherings and processions. The Bangladesh Railway authorities, on orders from higher-ups in the government, directed train services between Dhaka and the rest of the country to shut down to prevent quota reform protestors from using trains to travel or form gatherings, according to several unnamed railway supervisors speaking with Prothom Alo. The nationwide shutdown of Internet access begun on July 18 continued into July 19.\n\n### Resumption (29 July – 2 August)\n\nProtesters resumed large-scale demonstrations across various regions of the country after the government ignored an ultimatum to release their leaders. Police arrested 2,822 students in Dhaka.\n\n**Negotiations and Supreme Court Verdict (19–22 July)**\n\nAfter the deadly Shutdown, the Anti-discrimination Students' Movement and the government started negotiations on July 19 night. At midnight, a meeting took place between three government representatives and three representatives of the protesters: Sarjis Alam, Hasnat Abdullah, and Tanvir Ahmed.\n\n**Mass Killing and Casualties**\n\nThe mass killings carried out by the law enforcement agencies were described as \"July massacre\" in various sources. A preliminary report by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights published on August 16, 2024, stated that more than 400 fatalities were reported nationwide between July 16 and August 4, mainly due to violence carried out by state forces such as the Bangladesh Police, RAB, BGB, and Army, as well as the Chhatra League. The report stated that restrictions on communication and state interference in hospitals make this figure an undercount.\n\n**Damages**\n\nThe movement resulted in huge damage of various state properties in Bangladesh. According to a report by Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha, at least thirty major state establishments experienced arson and severe damage. The state broadcaster, Bangladesh Television (BTV), was attacked and set on fire on July 18, 2024. The building suffered extensive damage, with several sections completely burnt.\n\n**Mass Arrests and Detentions**\n\nThe Bangladesh Police, including Detective Branch (DB) and RAB, arrested a large number of student protesters and members of opposition political parties. As of July 30, the total count reached over 9,600. On July 23, plainclothes police arrested a non-protester HSC examinee after failing to find his elder brother. On July 26, plainclothes police officers detained three protest coordinators, namely Nahid Islam, Asif Mahmud, and Abu Baker Majumder, from Gonoshasthaya Kendra hospital.\n\n**Controversies**\n\nSheikh Hasina, the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, responded to a question about the anti-quota protests during a press conference on July 14, 2024, saying that the protests were a \"conspiracy\" to destabilize the government. The statement sparked widespread outrage and criticism from the protesters and opposition parties.\n\n**Indian Involvement**\n\nA report by The Mirror Asia alleged that 400 officers trained by Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW) were deployed to Dhaka at the request of Sheikh Hasina and India's security advisor Ajit Doval to suppress the movement. The report stated that these officers were involved in suppressing the movement using methods similar to those used in Kashmir and returned to Delhi on July 28.\n\n**International Reactions**\n\nHuman Rights Watch urged the Bangladeshi government to end the crisis, punish those committing serious crimes, and protect protesting students. They also called for increased scrutiny of Bangladeshi security forces by the UK and the EU. The All India Democratic Students Organisation staged a protest in Kolkata in support of the Bangladeshi students.\n\n**Gallery**\n\n* \n* \n*", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in

Valieva to join her group [8] Videos are available of Valieva's first competition at age 4 [12] as well as a later one at age 9 [13]\n\n\n2019–2020 season: Junior World champion\nValieva's international debut came in late August 2019 at a Junior Grand Prix competition in Courchevel, France Ranked third in the short program and first in the free skate, she won the gold medal ahead of Wi Seo-yeong of South Korea and teammate and training partner Maiia Khromykh [15] At the competition, Valieva became the second female skater ever to land a quadruple toe loop in competition [16] Her total score at the event was the fourth highest score achieved by a ladies' single skater at the junior level, behind teammates Alexandra Trusova, Anna Shcherbakova, and Alena Kostornaia Valieva also became the fourth junior lady to score above 200 points under the current GOE (Grade of Execution) system [17]\n\n\n2020–2021 season\nValieva skated at the 2020 Russian test skates in Moscow, showcasing her new programs for the 2020–21 season She executed a quad toe combination in her free skate [27] She competed at the second stage of the Russian Cup There, she skated cleanly, placing

174.31 points, also setting a new world record for total points (249.24) [35]\n\n\n2022–2023 season\nRussian and Belarusian athletes remained banned from international events for the 2022–23 figure skating season, so the Russian Figure Skating Federation hosted its own domestic Grand Prix series [49] Valieva was scheduled for the first Grand Prix event, the Golden Skate of Moscow In the free skate, she fell on a quadruple toe loop, but she still won the gold medal ahead of Sofia Akateva and Anastasiya Zinina [50] She then competed at the Grand Prix stage in her hometown, Kazan, and won another gold medal [51] She then competed at the Russian Championships held in Krasnoyarsk In the short program, she popped her triple axel and only performed a single axel, causing her to finish in fourth place [52] She won the free skate with a score of 170.71, but still finished second overall behind Sofia Akateva [53] In December 2022 Ukrainian government has issued personal sanctions 56 athletes who the Ukrainian Government accused of actively supporting the war in Ukraine, and justifying the military invasion and genocide of Ukrainians; this list included Valieva [54]\n\n\nOfficial probe into allegations of doping and misconduct\nOstensibly, a matter of allegations concerning misconduct by Valieva began on 25 December 2021, when Valieva submitted a routine urine sample for analysis following her win at the Russian Nationals on 24 December The normal 20-day testing time for the sample lapsed, apparently due to COVID-19 related backlogs at the testing laboratory; however, the positive doping test results were eventually forwarded for evaluation in February 2022, after the Beijing Olympics had started, and the team event had concluded [57] [58] On 14 November 2022, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) registered an appeal by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) about a possible violation of anti-doping rules by Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva [59]\n\n\nDuring Beijing Olympics\nThe medal ceremony for the team event, in which the ROC won gold, was originally scheduled for 8 February but was delayed over what International Olympic Committee (IOC) spokesperson Mark Adams described as a situation that required \"legal consultation\" with the International Skating Union (ISU) [60] Several media outlets reported on 9 February that the issue was a positive test by Valieva for the banned substance trimetazidine, [57] [58] which was officially confirmed on 11 February [61] The sample in question was taken by the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) at the 2022 Russian Figure Skating Championships on 25 December 2021 On 8 February 2022, the urine sample tested positive for traces of trimetazidine The sample was analyzed at the Doping Control Laboratory at Stockholm's Karolinska University Hospital, a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA)-accredited lab The test result came one day after the team event concluded [62] [63]\n\n\nAfter Beijing Olympics\nBy 9 March 2022, Travis Tygart of the USADA reported that Valieva had not requested that her \"B\" sample be tested, apparently accepting the results of initial testing and relying on her explanation that the banned substance TMZ belonged to her grandfather and only accidentally contaminated or became mixed into her own use of allowed nutrients and supplements Tygart further stated that as a minor, Valieva could still be either fully exculpated or given a warning concerning her testing positive, depending on the extent of findings in the ongoing RUSADA investigation of doping According to Tygart, an adverse finding against her as a first offense could still be assessed as a two-year suspension, which is half of the suspension time which could be assessed for adults On 17 March, WADA requested that RUSADA complete its report on Valieva and her entourage by 8 August 2022 [86] On 7 June 2022, ISU regulation governing the minimum age for competition at figure skating events was raised from 15 to 17 years of age following the Valieva incident at the Beijing Olympics [87]\n\n\n2024 disqualification by CAS and 2026 Winter Olympics\nOn 28 September CAS \"ordered the production of further documentation\" and announced that her hearing had been adjourned until 9–10 November It appeared that one of the parties in the case requested a file that had not previously been a part of the proceedings [98] On 10 November, CAS announced that a final decision was expected by the end of January 2024 [99] [100]\n\n\nSignificant technical achievements\nOn 23 August 2019, at the junior level of the Grand Prix in France, Valieva performed a quadruple toe loop with a positive GOE, which made her the second woman to perform this jump in the history of figure skating (after Alexandra Trusova) at competitions under the auspices of the International Skating Union [108] [109] On 18 October 2020, a video appeared on the Internet where she performed a triple Axel with complication in training with two hands up [110] [111] On 5 December 2020, she cleanly performed the triple Axel in the short program at the stage of the Russian Cup in Moscow On 12 February

recognition for her technical skills and artistic expression. Born on April 26, 2006, in Kazan, Russia, Valieva began her figure skating journey at a young age and has since become one of the most promising young skaters in the world.\n\n**Introduction**\nFigure skating is a highly technical and demanding sport that requires athletes to possess strength, flexibility, and artistry. Kamila Valieva is one of the few skaters who have mastered the technical aspects of figure skating while also showcasing her artistic expression. This article will provide an overview of Valieva's life, career, and achievements in figure skating.\n\n**Personal Life**\nValieva was born in Kazan, Russia, to a family of Volga Tatar ethnicity. Her parents, Ravil and Gulnara, have been supportive of her figure skating career from the beginning. Valieva's biological father, Ravil, is a military man who now lives in Crimea. According to relatives, Ravil's background has had an impact on Valieva's life, and he has been involved in her figure skating career. However, the exact nature of their relationship is not publicly known.\n\n**Career**\nValieva began skating in 2009 at the RSDUSSHOR in Kazan. Her first coach was Ksenia Ivanova, who helped her develop her basic skills. In 2013, Valieva moved to Moscow to train at the SSHOR Moskvich under the guidance of Marina Kudriavtseva, Igor Lyutikov, and Natalia Dubinskaya. In 2018, she switched to the Sambo-70 club, where she trained under the guidance of Eteri Tutberidze.\n\n**Early Career**\nValieva's early career was marked by her rapid progress in figure skating. At the age of 4, she participated in her first competition, and by the age of 9, she was already competing at a higher level. Her coaches helped her develop her technical skills, and she quickly became known for her strong jumps and footwork.\n\n**2019-2020 Season: Junior World Champion**\nValieva's international debut came in late August 2019 at a Junior Grand Prix competition in Courchevel, France. She won the gold medal ahead of Wi Seo-yeong of South Korea and teammate Maiia Khromykh. This competition marked a significant milestone in Valieva's career, as she became the second female skater to land a quadruple toe loop in competition.\n\n**2020-2021 Season**\nValieva skated at the 2020 Russian test skates in Moscow, showcasing her new programs for the 2020-21 season. She executed a quad toe combination in her free skate and competed at the second stage of the Russian Cup. She won the silver medal and later competed at the fifth stage of the Russian Cup, where she won the gold medal with one of the highest total scores in Russian domestic competition.\n\n**2021-2022 Season: Beijing Olympics**\nValieva made her international senior debut at the 2021 CS Finlandia Trophy. She placed third in the short program after falling on her triple Axel attempt. In her free skate, she landed three quad jumps, recording a world record score of 174.31 points. This achievement marked a significant milestone in Valieva's career, as she became the first female skater to land three quadruple jumps in a single program.\n\n**2022-2023 Season**\nValieva competed at the Russian Championships held in Krasnoyarsk. In the short program, she popped her triple axel and only performed a single axel, causing her to finish in fourth place. However, she won the free skate with a score of 170.71, but still finished second overall behind Sofia Akateva.\n\n**Official Probe into Allegations of Doping and Misconduct**\nIn December 2021, Valieva submitted a routine urine sample for analysis following her win at the Russian Nationals. The normal 20-day testing time for the sample lapsed due to COVID-19 related backlogs at the testing laboratory. However, the positive doping test results were eventually forwarded for evaluation in February 2022, after the Beijing Olympics had started.\n\n**During Beijing Olympics**\nThe medal ceremony for the team event was originally scheduled for February 8 but was delayed due to a situation that required \"legal consultation\" with the International Skating Union. Several media outlets reported that the issue was a positive test by Valieva for the banned substance trimetazidine. The sample in question was taken by the Russian Anti-Doping Agency at the 2022 Russian Figure Skating Championships on December 25, 2021.\n\n**After Beijing Olympics**\nBy March 9, 2022, Travis Tygart of the USADA reported that Valieva had not requested that her \"B\" sample be tested. According to Tygart, an adverse finding against her as a first offense could still be assessed as a two-year suspension, which is half of the suspension time that could be assessed for adults.\n\n**2024 Disqualification by CAS and 2026 Winter Olympics**\nOn September 28, 2023, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) ordered the production of further documentation and announced that her hearing had been adjourned until November 9-10, 2023. On November 10, CAS announced that a final decision was expected by the end of January 2024.\n\n**Significant Technical Achievements**\nOn August 23, 2019, at the junior level of the Grand Prix in France, Valieva performed a quadruple toe loop with a positive GOE, making her the second woman to perform this jump in the history of figure skating at competitions under the auspices of the International Skating Union.

On December 5, 2020, she cleanly performed the triple Axel in the short program at the stage of the Russian Cup in Moscow.\n\n**Awards**\nIn February 2022, after the end of the Olympics, Valieva

{"title": "Muammar_Gaddafi", "content": "\nEarly life and career\nMuammar Mohammed Abu Minyar al-Gaddafi [13] was born near Qasr Abu Hadi, a rural area outside the town of Sirte in the deserts of Tripolitania, Italian western Libya [14] Gaddafi was the only son of his parents and the youngest of four siblings His family came from a small, relatively uninfluential tribe called the Qadhadhfa, [15] who were Arab in heritage His mother was named Aisha bin Niran (died 1978), and his father, Mohammad Abdul Salam bin Hamed bin Mohammad, was known as Abu Meniar (died 1985); the latter earned a meager subsistence as a goat and camel herder [16]\n\n\nChildhood: 1940s to 1950\nMuammar Mohammed Abu Minyar al-Gaddafi [13] was born near Qasr Abu Hadi, a rural area outside the town of Sirte in the deserts of Tripolitania, Italian western Libya [14] Gaddafi was the only son of his parents and the youngest of four siblings His family came from a small, relatively uninfluential tribe called the Qadhadhfa, [15] who were Arab in heritage His mother was named Aisha bin Niran (died 1978), and his father, Mohammad Abdul Salam bin Hamed bin Mohammad, was known as Abu Meniar (died 1985); the latter earned a meager subsistence as a goat and camel herder [16]\n\n\nEducation and political activism: 1950–1963\nGaddafi's earliest education was of a religious nature, imparted by a local Islamic teacher [25] Subsequently, moving to nearby Sirte to attend elementary school, he progressed through six grades in four years [26] Education in Libya was not free, but his father thought it would greatly benefit his son despite the financial strain During the week Gaddafi slept in a mosque, and only at weekends and holidays walked 20 miles (32 km) to visit his parents Even though Gaddafi's father was not educated, he made great sacrifices to send his son to school [27] As an impoverished Bedouin, he faced bullying and discrimination from his city-dwelling classmates However, he had many Egyptian teachers who informed him of the dramatic events occurring in their homeland [26] From Sirte, he and his family moved to the market town of Sabha in Fezzan, south-central Libya, where his father worked as a caretaker for a tribal leader while Muammar attended secondary school, something neither parent had done [28] Gaddafi was popular at this school; some friends made there received significant jobs in his later administration, most notably his best friend, Abdul Salam Jalloud [29]\n\n\nMilitary training: 1963–1966\nGaddafi briefly studied history at the University of Libya in Benghazi before dropping out to join the military [39] Despite his police record, in 1963 he began training at the Royal Military Academy, Benghazi, alongside several like-minded friends from Misrata The armed forces offered the only opportunity for upward social mobility for underprivileged Libyans, and Gaddafi recognized it as a potential instrument of political change [40] Under Idris, Libya's armed forces were trained by the British military; this angered Gaddafi, who viewed the British as imperialists, and accordingly, he refused to learn English and was rude to the British officers, ultimately failing his exams [41] British trainers reported him for insubordination and abusive behaviour, stating their suspicion that he was involved in the assassination of the military academy's commander in 1963 Such reports were ignored, and Gaddafi quickly progressed through the course [contradictory] [42]\n\n\nLibyan Arab Republic\nPeople of Libya! In response to your own will, fulfilling your most heartfelt wishes, answering your most incessant demands for change and regeneration, and your longing to strive towards these ends: listening to your incitement to rebel, your armed forces have undertaken the overthrow of the corrupt regime, the stench of which has sickened and horrified us all At a single blow our gallant army has toppled these idols and has destroyed their images By a single stroke it has lightened the long dark night in which the Turkish domination was followed first by Italian rule, then by this reactionary and decadent regime which was no more than a hotbed of extortion, faction, treachery and treason.\n\n\nCoup d'état: 1969\nPeople of Libya! In response to your own will, fulfilling your most heartfelt wishes, answering your most incessant demands for change and regeneration, and your longing to strive towards these ends: listening to your incitement to rebel, your armed forces have undertaken the overthrow of the corrupt regime, the stench of which has sickened and horrified us all At a single blow our gallant army has toppled these idols and has destroyed their images By a single stroke it has lightened the long dark night in which the Turkish domination was followed first by Italian rule, then by this reactionary and decadent regime which was no more than a hotbed of extortion, faction, treachery and treason.\n\n\nConsolidating leadership: 1969–1973\nThe 12-member central committee of the Free Officers proclaimed themselves the Revolutionary Command Council (RCC), the government of the new republic [69] Lieutenant Gaddafi became RCC chairman, and therefore the de facto head of state, also appointing himself to the rank of colonel and becoming commander-in-chief of the armed forces [70] Jalloud became Prime Minister, [71] while a civilian Council of Ministers headed by Sulaiman Maghribi was founded to implement RCC policy [72] Libya's administrative capital was moved from al-Beida to Tripoli [73]\n\n\nEconomic and social reform\nThe RCC's early economic policy has been characterized as being state capitalist in orientation [88] Many initiatives were established to aid entrepreneurs and develop a Libyan bourgeoisie [89] Seeking to expand the cultivatable acreage in Libya, in September 1969 the government launched a \"Green Revolution\" to increase agricultural productivity so that Libya could rely less on imported food [90] The hope was to make Libya self-sufficient in food production [91] All land that had either been expropriated from Italian settlers or which was not in use was repossessed and redistributed [92] Irrigation systems were established along the northern coastline and around various inland oases [93] Production costs often surpassed the value of the produce and thus Libyan agricultural production remained in deficit, relying heavily on state subsidies [94]\n\n\nForeign relations\nFollowing Anwar Sadat's ascension to the Egyptian presidency, Libya's relations with Egypt deteriorated [192] Over the coming years, the two slipped into a state of cold war [193] Sadat was perturbed by Gaddafi's unpredictability and insistence that Egypt required a cultural revolution akin to that being carried out in Libya [192] In February 1973, Israeli forces shot down Libyan Arab Airlines Flight 114, which had strayed from Egyptian airspace into Israeli-held territory during a sandstorm Gaddafi's foreign minister Salah Busir was on board and allegedly targeted by Israel in retaliation for the Munich massacre [194] Gaddafi was infuriated that Egypt had not done more to prevent the incident, and in retaliation planned to destroy the Queen Elizabeth 2, a British ship chartered by American Jews to sail to Haifa for Israel's 25th anniversary Gaddafi ordered an Egyptian submarine to target the ship, but Sadat cancelled the order, fearing a military escalation [195]\n\n\nThe \"Popular Revolution\": 1973–1977\nOn 16 April 1973, Gaddafi proclaimed the start of a \"Popular Revolution\" in a speech at Zuwarah [154] He initiated this with a five-point plan, the first point of which dissolved all existing laws, to be replaced by revolutionary enactments The second point proclaimed that all opponents of the revolution had to be removed, while the third initiated an administrative revolution that Gaddafi proclaimed would remove all traces of bureaucracy and the bourgeoisie The fourth point announced that the population must form People's Committees and be armed to defend the revolution, while the fifth proclaimed the beginning of the Cultural Revolution in Libya, to expunge the country of \"poisonous\" foreign influences [155] He began to lecture on this new phase of the revolution in Libya, Egypt, and France [156] As a process, it had many similarities with the Cultural Revolution implemented in China [157]\n\n\nThird International Theory and The Green Book\nIn June 1973, Gaddafi created a political ideology as a basis for the Popular Revolution: Third International Theory This approach regarded both the US and the Soviet Union as imperialist and thus rejected Western capitalism as well as Marxist–Leninist atheism [166] In this respect, it was similar to the Three Worlds Theory developed by China's political leader Mao Zedong [167] As part of this theory, Gaddafi praised nationalism as a progressive force and advocated the creation of a pan-Arab state which would lead the Islamic and Third Worlds against imperialism [168] Gaddafi saw Islam as having a key role in this ideology, calling for an Islamic revival that returned to the origins of the Qur'an, rejecting scholarly interpretations and the Hadith; in doing so, he angered many Libyan clerics [169] During 1973 and 1974, his government deepened the legal reliance on sharia, for instance by introducing flogging as punishment for those convicted of adultery or homosexual activity [170]\n\n\nForeign relations\nFollowing Anwar Sadat's ascension to the Egyptian presidency, Libya's relations with Egypt deteriorated [192] Over the coming years, the two slipped into a state of cold war [193] Sadat was perturbed by Gaddafi's unpredictability and insistence that Egypt required a cultural revolution akin to that being carried out in Libya [192] In February 1973, Israeli forces shot down Libyan Arab Airlines Flight 114, which had strayed from Egyptian airspace into Israeli-held territory during a sandstorm Gaddafi's foreign minister Salah Busir was on board and allegedly targeted by Israel in retaliation for the Munich massacre [194] Gaddafi was infuriated that Egypt had not done more to prevent the incident, and in retaliation planned to destroy the Queen Elizabeth 2, a British ship chartered by American Jews to sail to Haifa for Israel's 25th anniversary Gaddafi ordered an Egyptian submarine to target the ship, but Sadat cancelled the order, fearing a military escalation [195]\n\n\nGreat Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya\nOn 2 March 1977, the General People's Congress adopted the \"Declaration on the Establishment of the Authority of the People\" at Gaddafi's behest Dissolving the Libyan Arab Republic, it was replaced by the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya (Arabic: الجماهيرية العربية الليبية الشعبية الاشتراكية, al-Jamāhīrīyah al-‘Arabīyah al-Lībīyah ash-Sha‘bīyah al-Ishtirākīyah), a \"state of the masses\" conceptualized by Gaddafi [216] A new, all-green banner was adopted as the country's flag [217] Officially, the Jamahiriya was a direct democracy in which the people ruled themselves through the 187 Basic People's Congresses (BPCs), where all adult Libyans participated and voted on national decisions These then sent members to the annual General People's Congress, which was broadcast live on television In principle, the People's Congresses were Libya's highest authority, with major decisions proposed by government officials or with Gaddafi himself requiring the consent of the People's Congresses [218] Gaddafi became General Secretary of the GPC, although he stepped down from this position in early 1979 and appointed himself \"Leader of the Revolution\" [219]\n\n\nFoundation: 1977\nOn 2 March 1977, the General People's Congress adopted the \"Declaration on the Establishment of the Authority of the People\" at Gaddafi's behest Dissolving the Libyan Arab Republic, it was replaced by the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya (Arabic: الجماهيرية العربية الليبية الشعبية الاشتراكية, al-Jamāhīrīyah al-‘Arabīyah al-Lībīyah ash-Sha‘bīyah al-Ishtirākīyah), a \"state of the masses\" conceptualized by Gaddafi [216] A new,

Secretary of the GPC, although he stepped down from this position in early 1979 and appointed himself \"Leader of the Revolution\" [219]\n\n\nRevolutionary Committees and furthering socialism: 1978–1980\nIf socialism is defined as a redistribution of wealth and resources, a socialist revolution clearly occurred in Libya after 1969 and most especially in the second half of the 1970s The management of the economy was increasingly socialist in intent and effect with wealth in housing, capital and land significantly redistributed or in the process of redistribution Private enterprise was virtually eliminated, largely replaced by a centrally controlled economy.\n\n\nConflict with the US and its allies: 1981–1986\nThe early 80s saw economic trouble in Libya; from 1982 to 1986, annual oil revenues dropped from $21 to $5.4 billion [274] Focusing on irrigation projects, 1983 saw construction start on Libya's largest and most expensive infrastructure project, the Great Man-Made River; although designed to be finished by the end of the decade, it remained incomplete at the start of the 21st century [275] Military spending increased, while other administrative budgets were cut [276] Foreign debt rose, [277] and austerity measures were introduced to promote self-reliance; in 1985 there was a mass deportation of foreign workers, mostly Egyptian and Tunisian [278] Domestic threats continued to plague Gaddafi; in May 1984, his Bab al-Azizia home was unsuccessfully attacked by a militia—linked to the NFSL or Muslim Brotherhood—and in the aftermath 5,000 dissidents were arrested [279] In spring 1985, members of the military tried to assassinate Gaddafi twice The first was a plot by conservative officers to assassinate him at a villa on the outskirts of Tripoli; the second was an assault on his convoy [280] In November 1985, Colonel Hassan Ishkal, the third most powerful man in Libya, head of the military region of Sirte, died in a suspicious car accident Ishkal's death was attributed to Jalloud, Khalifa Hunaysh or Gaddafi [281] [282] [283]\n\n\n\"Revolution within a Revolution\": 1987–1998\nThe late 1980s saw a series of liberalizing economic reforms within Libya designed to cope with the decline in oil revenues In May 1987, Gaddafi announced the start of the \"Revolution within a Revolution\", which began with reforms to industry and agriculture and saw the re-opening of small business [321] Restrictions were placed on the activities of the Revolutionary Committees; in March 1988, their role was narrowed by the newly created Ministry for Mass Mobilization and Revolutionary Leadership to restrict their violence and judicial role, while in August 1988 Gaddafi publicly criticized them [322]\nIn March, hundreds of political prisoners were freed, with Gaddafi falsely claiming that there were no further political prisoners in Libya [323] In June, Libya's government issued the Great Green Charter on Human Rights in the Era of the Masses, in which 27 articles laid out goals, rights, and guarantees to improve the situation of human rights in Libya, restricting the use of the death penalty and calling for its eventual abolition Many of the measures suggested in the charter would be implemented the following year, although others remained inactive [324] Also in 1989, the government founded the Al-Gaddafi International Prize for Human Rights, to be awarded to figures from the Third World who had struggled against colonialism and imperialism; the first year's winner was South African anti-apartheid activist Nelson Mandela [325] From 1994 through to 1997, the government initiated cleansing committees to root out corruption, particularly in the economic sector [326]\n\n\nPan-Africanism, reconciliation and privatization: 1999–2011\nDuring the final years of the 20th century, Gaddafi—frustrated by the failure of his pan-Arab ideals and the refusal of the Arab world to challenge the international air embargo imposed on Libya—increasingly rejected Arab nationalism in favour of pan-Africanism, emphasizing Libya's African identity [354] [355] In a 1998 interview, Gaddafi claimed that \"the Arab world is finished\" and expressed his wish for Libya to become a \"black country.\" [355] From 1997 to 2000, Libya initiated cooperative agreements or bilateral aid arrangements with 10 African states, [356] and in 1999 joined the Community of Sahel-Saharan States [357] In June 1999, Gaddafi visited Mandela in South Africa, [358] and the following month attended the OAU summit in Algiers, calling for greater political and economic integration across the continent and advocating the foundation of a United States of Africa [359] He became one of the founders of the African Union (AU), initiated in July 2002 to replace the OAU At the opening ceremonies, he called for African states to reject conditional aid from the developed world, a direct contrast to the message of South African President Thabo Mbeki [360] There was speculation that Gaddafi wanted to become the AU's first chair, raising concerns within Africa that this would damage the Union's international standing, particularly with the West [361]\n\n\nLinks with Africa and conflicts in the Arab League\nDuring the final years of the 20th century, Gaddafi—frustrated by the failure of his pan-Arab ideals and the refusal of the Arab world to challenge the international air embargo imposed on Libya—increasingly rejected Arab nationalism in favour of pan-Africanism, emphasizing Libya's African identity [354] [355] In a 1998 interview, Gaddafi claimed that \"the Arab world is finished\" and expressed his wish for Libya to become a \"black country.\" [355] From 1997 to 2000, Libya initiated cooperative agreements or bilateral aid arrangements with 10 African states, [356] and in 1999 joined the Community of Sahel-Saharan States [357] In June 1999, Gaddafi visited Mandela in South Africa, [358] and the following month attended the OAU summit in Algiers, calling for greater political and economic integration across the continent and advocating the foundation of a United States of Africa [359] He became one of the founders of the African Union (AU), initiated in July 2002 to replace the OAU At the opening ceremonies, he called for African states to reject conditional aid from the developed world, a direct contrast to the message of South African President Thabo Mbeki [360] There was speculation that Gaddafi wanted to become the AU's first chair, raising concerns within Africa that this would damage the Union's international standing, particularly with the West [361]\n\n\nRebuilding links with the West\nIn 1999, Libya began secret talks with the British government to normalize relations [383] In 2001, Gaddafi publicly condemned the September 11 attacks on the US by al-Qaeda, expressing sympathy with the victims and calling for Libyan involvement in the US-led War on Terror against militant Islamism [384] His government continued suppressing domestic Islamism, at the same time as Gaddafi called for the wider application of sharia law [385] Libya also cemented connections with China and North Korea, being visited by Chinese President Jiang Zemin in April 2002 [386] However, relations with China became strained in May 2006 due to a visit to Tripoli by Taiwanese President Chen Shui-bian [387] [388] [389] Influenced by the events of the Iraq War, in December 2003, Libya renounced its possession of weapons of mass destruction, decommissioning its chemical and nuclear weapons programs [390] Relations with the US improved as a result [391] British Prime Minister Tony Blair visited Gaddafi in March 2004; [392] the pair developed close personal ties [393] In 2003, Libya paid US$2.7 billion to the families of the victims of the Lockerbie bombing as it was the condition the US and UK had made for terminating the remaining UN sanctions Libya continued to deny any role in the bombing [394] [395] In 2009, Gaddafi attempted to strong-arm global energy companies operating in Libya to cover Libya's settlement with the families of the victims of Lockerbie [396]\n\n\nEconomic reform\nLibya's economy witnessed increasing privatization; although rejecting the socialist policies of nationalized industry advocated in The Green Book, government figures asserted that they were forging \"people's socialism\" rather than capitalism [419] Gaddafi welcomed these reforms, calling for wide-scale privatization in a March 2003 speech; [420] he promised that Libya would join the World Trade Organization [421] These reforms encouraged private investment in Libya's economy [422] By 2004, there was US$40 billion of direct foreign investment in Libya, a six-fold rise over 2003 [423] Sectors of Libya's population reacted against these reforms with public demonstrations, [424] and in March 2006, revolutionary hard-liners took control of the GPC cabinet; although scaling back the pace of the changes, they did not halt them [425] In 2010, plans were announced that would have seen half the Libyan economy privatized over the following decade, [426] these plans appear to have been soon abandoned however, as the companies that the government stated they were going to float on the stock market, among them the National Commercial Bank and the Libyan Iron and Steel Company were never floated and remained 100% state-owned Many socialist policies remained however, with subsidiaries of logistics company HB Group being nationalized in 2007 [427] Agriculture remained largely untouched by the reforms, with farms remaining cooperatives, the Agricultural Bank of Libya remaining wholly state-owned and state interventionist policies and price controls remaining [428] The oil industry remained largely state-owned, with the wholly state-owned National Oil Corporation retaining a 70% share in Libya's oil industry, the government also imposed a 93% tax on all oil that foreign companies produced in Libya [429] Price controls and subsidies over oil and food remained in place, and state-provided benefits such as free education, universal healthcare, free housing, free water and free electricity remained in place [430] Libya also changed its stance on the WTO after the removal of technocrat Shukri Ghanem, with Gaddafi condemning the WTO as a neocolonial terrorist organisation, and urging African and Third World countries not to join it [431]\n\n\nLibyan Civil War and assassination\nFollowing the start of the Arab Spring in 2011, Gaddafi spoke out in favour of Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, then threatened by the Tunisian Revolution He suggested that Tunisia's people would be satisfied if Ben Ali introduced a Jamahiriyah system there [436] Fearing domestic protest, Libya's government implemented preventive measures by reducing food prices, purging the army leadership of potential defectors, and releasing several Islamist prisoners [437] This proved ineffective, and on 17 February 2011, major protests broke out against Gaddafi's government Unlike Tunisia or Egypt, Libya was largely religiously homogeneous and had no strong Islamist movement, but there was widespread dissatisfaction with the corruption and entrenched systems of patronage, while unemployment had reached around 30 percent [438]\n\n\nOrigins and development: February–August 2011\nFollowing the start of the Arab Spring in 2011, Gaddafi spoke out in favour of Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, then threatened by the Tunisian Revolution He suggested that Tunisia's people would be satisfied if Ben Ali introduced a Jamahiriyah system there [436] Fearing domestic protest, Libya's government implemented preventive measures by reducing food prices,

government Unlike Tunisia or Egypt, Libya was largely religiously homogeneous and had no strong Islamist movement, but there was widespread dissatisfaction with the corruption and entrenched systems of patronage, while unemployment had reached around 30 percent [438]\n\n\nCapture and killing\nAfter the fall of Tripoli, only a few towns in western Libya such as Bani Walid, Sebha, and Sirte remained Gaddafist strongholds [456] Gaddafi was reportedly planning to catch up with his Sebha commander Ali Kanna's Tuareg forces and seek asylum in Burkina Faso [458] Instead, Gaddafi retreated to his hometown of Sirte, [459] where he convened a meeting with his son Mutassim and intelligence chief Abdullah Senussi and learned that his youngest son Khamis had been killed by a NATO airstrike on 29 August [460] In the weeks that followed, Gaddafi continued to broadcast defiant audio messages through Syria-based Arrai TV [461] [462] [456] On 10 September, General Massoud Abdel Hafiz announced the formation of the Republic of Fezzan in Sebha, where Gaddafi would be president for life [463] Sebha fell on 22 September [464]\n\n\nPolitical ideology\nWe call it the Third  [International] Theory to indicate that there is a new path for all those who reject both materialist capitalism and atheist communism The path is for all the people of the world who abhor the dangerous confrontation between the Warsaw and North Atlantic military alliances It is for all those who believe that all nations of the world are brothers under the aegis of the rule of God.\n\n\nIslamic modernism and Islamic socialism\nGaddafi rejected the secularist approach to Arab nationalism that had been pervasive in Syria, [510] with his revolutionary movement placing a far stronger emphasis on Islam than previous Arab nationalist movements had done [511] He deemed Arabism and Islam to be inseparable, referring to them as \"one and indivisible\", [512] and called on the Arab world's Christian minority to convert to Islam [513] He insisted that Islamic law should be the basis for the law of the state, blurring any distinction between the religious and secular realms [514] He desired unity across the Islamic world, [515] and encouraged the propagation of the faith elsewhere; on a 2010 visit to Italy, he paid a modelling agency to find 200 young Italian women for a lecture he gave urging them to convert [516] According to the Gaddafi biographer Jonathan Bearman, in Islamic terms Gaddafi was a modernist rather than a fundamentalist, for he subordinated religion to the political system rather than seeking to Islamicise the state as Islamists sought to do [517] He was driven by a sense of \"divine mission\", believing himself a conduit of God's will, and thought that he must achieve his goals \"no matter what the cost\" [518] His interpretation of Islam was nevertheless idiosyncratic, [517] and he clashed with conservative Libyan clerics Many criticized his attempts to encourage women to enter traditionally male-only sectors of society, such as the armed forces Gaddafi was keen to improve women's status, although saw the sexes as \"separate but equal\" and therefore felt women should usually remain in traditional roles [519]\n\n\nPersonal life\nA very private individual, [485] Gaddafi was given to rumination and solitude and could be reclusive [533] Gaddafi described himself as a \"simple revolutionary\" and \"pious Muslim\" called upon by God to continue Nasser's work [534] Gaddafi was an austere and devout Muslim, [535] although according to Vandewalle, his interpretation of Islam was \"deeply personal and idiosyncratic.\" [235] He was also a football enthusiast [536] and enjoyed both playing the sport and horse riding as a means of recreation [537] He regarded himself as an intellectual; [538] he was a fan of Beethoven and said his favourite novels were Uncle Tom's Cabin, Roots, and The Outsider [536]\n\n\nPublic life\nAccording to Vandewalle, Gaddafi \"dominated  [Libya's] political life\" during his period in power [563] The sociologist Raymond A Hinnebusch described the Libyan as \"perhaps the most exemplary contemporary case of the politics of charismatic leadership\", displaying all of the traits of charismatic authority outlined by the sociologist Max Weber [564] According to Hinnebusch, the foundations of Gaddafi's \"personal charismatic authority\" in Libya stemmed from the blessing he had received from Nasser coupled with \"nationalist achievements\" such as the expulsion of foreign military bases, the extraction of higher prices for Libyan oil, and his vocal support for the Palestinian and other anti-imperialist causes [565]\n\n\nAwards and honours\nSupporters praised Gaddafi's administration for the creation of a more equal society through domestic reform [575] They stressed the regime's achievements in combating homelessness, ensuring access to food and safe drinking water, and to dramatic improvements in education [575] Supporters have also applauded achievements in medical care, praising the universal free healthcare provided under the Gaddafist administration, with diseases like cholera and typhoid being contained and life expectancy raised [575]\n\n\nReception and legacy\nSupporters praised Gaddafi's administration for the creation of a more equal society through domestic reform [575] They

revolutionary and politician who served as the head of the Libyan Arab Republic from 1969 until his death in 2011. He was a key figure in the modern history of Libya and a prominent leader in the Arab world.\n\n**Early Life and Career**\n\nMuammar Mohammed Abu Minyar al-Gaddafi was born near Qasr Abu Hadi, a rural area outside the town of Sirte in the deserts of Tripolitania, Italian western Libya. He was the only son of his parents and the youngest of four siblings. His family came from a small, relatively uninfluential tribe called the Qadhadhfa, who were Arab in heritage. His mother was named Aisha bin Niran, and his father, Mohammad Abdul Salam bin Hamed bin Mohammad, was known as Abu Meniar and earned a meager subsistence as a goat and camel herder.\n\n**Childhood: 1940s to 1950**\n\nGaddafi's earliest education was of a religious nature, imparted by a local Islamic teacher. Subsequently, moving to nearby Sirte to attend elementary school, he progressed through six grades in four years. Education in Libya was not free, but his father thought it would greatly benefit his son despite the financial strain. During the week, Gaddafi slept in a mosque, and only at weekends and holidays, he walked 20 miles (32 km) to visit his parents. Despite his father not being educated, he made great sacrifices to send his son to school.\n\n**Education and Political Activism: 1950–1963**\n\nGaddafi's education continued in Sirte, where he developed a strong interest in politics and social justice. He was influenced by the Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser and the ideas of Arab nationalism. Gaddafi's father, who was a conservative and a tribesman, opposed his son's involvement in politics. Gaddafi's early education was in Arabic and Islamic studies, but he later attended the University of Libya in Benghazi, where he studied law and economics. However, he dropped out of university to join the military, where he was trained in the Royal Military Academy.\n\n**Military Training: 1963–1966**\n\nGaddafi's military training was brief, and he was not a successful student. He was known for his insubordination and was reported to have refused to learn English, which was the language of instruction. British trainers reported him for insubordination and abusive behavior, stating their suspicion that he was involved in the assassination of the military academy's commander in 1963. Despite this, Gaddafi quickly progressed through the course and became a lieutenant in the Libyan army.\n\n**Libyan Arab Republic**\n\nGaddafi's military career was cut short when he led a successful coup against King Idris in 1969. The coup was bloodless, and Gaddafi became the chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council (RCC) and the head of the Libyan Arab Republic. The RCC was a group of military officers who had been recruited by Gaddafi and were loyal to him. The RCC quickly established a new government and implemented a series of radical policies, including the nationalization of key industries and the redistribution of land.\n\n**Consolidating Leadership: 1969–1973**\n\nThe RCC's early policies were aimed at consolidating Gaddafi's power and establishing a new socialist economy. The RCC nationalized key industries, including oil, and established a new system of land ownership. Gaddafi also implemented a series of policies aimed at promoting social justice and equality, including the establishment of free education and healthcare. The RCC also established a new system of government, which was based on the principles of socialism and Arab nationalism.\n\n**Economic and Social Reform**\n\nThe RCC's early economic policies were aimed at establishing a socialist economy and promoting social justice. The RCC nationalized key industries, including oil, and established a new system of land ownership. Gaddafi also implemented a series of policies aimed at promoting social justice and equality, including the establishment of free education and healthcare. The RCC also established a new system of government, which was based on the principles of socialism and Arab nationalism.\n\n**Foreign Relations**\n\nGaddafi's foreign policy was aimed at promoting Arab nationalism and socialism. He established close relations with other Arab countries and became a key figure in the Non-Aligned Movement. Gaddafi also established close relations with the Soviet Union and became a key ally of the Soviet Union in the Middle East. However, Gaddafi's relations with the West were strained, particularly with the United States and Britain.\n\n**The \"Popular Revolution\": 1973–1977**\n\nIn 1973, Gaddafi proclaimed the start of a \"Popular Revolution\" in a speech at Zuwarah. The Popular Revolution was a new phase of the revolution, which aimed at promoting social justice and equality. Gaddafi initiated a five-point plan, which included the dissolution of all existing laws, the removal of all opponents of the revolution, and the establishment of a new system of government based on the principles of socialism and Arab nationalism.\n\n**Third International Theory and The Green Book**\n\nIn June 1973, Gaddafi created a political ideology as a basis for the Popular Revolution: Third International Theory. The Third International Theory regarded both the US and the Soviet Union as imperialist and thus rejected Western capitalism and Marxist-Leninist atheism. Gaddafi also wrote The Green Book, which was a three-volume work that outlined his vision for a new world order based on the principles of socialism and Arab nationalism.\n\n**Foreign Relations: 1977–1980**\n\nGaddafi's foreign policy continued to be aimed at promoting Arab nationalism and socialism. He established close relations with other Arab countries and became a key figure in the Non-Aligned Movement. Gaddafi also established close relations with the Soviet Union and became a key ally of the Soviet Union in the Middle East. However, Gaddafi's relations with the West were strained, particularly with the United States and Britain.\n\n**Conflict with the US and its Allies: 1981–1986**\n\nThe early 1980s saw economic trouble in Libya; from 1982 to 1986, annual oil revenues dropped from $21 to $5.4 billion. Gaddafi focused on irrigation projects, and in 1983, construction started on Libya's largest and most expensive infrastructure project, the Great Man-Made River. Military spending increased, while other administrative budgets were cut. Foreign debt rose, and austerity measures were introduced to promote self-reliance.\n\n**\"Revolution within a Revolution\": 1987–1998**\n\nThe late 1980s saw a series of liberalizing economic reforms within Libya designed to cope with the decline in oil revenues. In May 1987, Gaddafi announced the start of the \"Revolution within a Revolution\", which began with reforms to industry and agriculture and saw the re-opening of small business. Restrictions were placed on the activities of the Revolutionary Committees, and in March 1988, their role was narrowed by the newly created Ministry for Mass Mobilization and Revolutionary Leadership.\n\n**Pan-Africanism, Reconciliation and Privatization: 1999–2011**\n\nDuring the final years of the 20th century, Gaddafi increasingly rejected Arab nationalism in favor of pan-Africanism, emphasizing Libya's African identity. He became one of the founders of the African Union (AU) and called for African states to reject conditional aid from the developed world. Libya also cemented connections with China and North Korea, and in December 2003, Libya renounced its possession of weapons of mass destruction.\n\n**Rebuilding Links with the West**\n\nIn 1999, Libya began secret talks with the British government to normalize relations. In 2001, Gaddafi publicly condemned the September 11 attacks on the US by al-Qaeda, expressing sympathy with the victims and calling for Libyan involvement in the US-led War on Terror against militant Islamism. Relations with the US improved as a result, and in 2003, Libya paid $2.7 billion to the families of the victims of the Lockerbie bombing.\n\n**Economic Reform**\n\nLibya's economy witnessed increasing privatization, although rejecting the socialist policies of nationalized industry advocated in The Green Book. Gaddafi welcomed these reforms, calling for wide-scale privatization in a March 2003 speech. By 2004, there was $40 billion of direct foreign investment in Libya, a six-fold rise over 2003.\n\n**Libyan Civil War and Assassination**\n\nFollowing the start of the Arab Spring in 2011, Gaddafi spoke out in favor of Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, then threatened by the Tunisian Revolution. Protests broke out against Gaddafi's government on February 17, 2011, and the Libyan Civil War began. Gaddafi was killed on October 20, 2011, in Sirte, during the Battle of Sirte.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nGaddafi's legacy is complex and contentious. Supporters praise his administration for the creation of a more equal society through domestic reform. Critics condemn his authoritarian rule, human rights abuses, and support for terrorism. Gaddafi's policies aimed to promote social justice and equality, but his regime was marked by corruption and repression.\n\n**References**\n\nThe references for this article are not included here.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Muammar_Gaddafi\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life and career\nMuammar Mohammed Abu Minyar al-Gaddafi [13] was born near Qasr Abu Hadi, a rural area outside the town of Sirte in the deserts of Tripolitania, Italian western Libya [14] Gaddafi was the only son of his parents and the youngest of four siblings His family came from a small, relatively uninfluential tribe called the Qadhadhfa, [15] who were Arab in heritage His mother was named Aisha bin Niran (died 1978), and his father, Mohammad Abdul Salam bin Hamed bin Mohammad, was known as Abu Meniar (died 1985); the latter earned a meager subsistence as a goat and camel herder [16]\n\n\nChildhood: 1940s to 1950\nMuammar Mohammed Abu Minyar al-Gaddafi [13] was born near Qasr Abu Hadi, a rural area outside the town of Sirte in the deserts of Tripolitania, Italian western Libya [14] Gaddafi was the only son of his parents and the youngest of four siblings His family came from a small, relatively uninfluential tribe called the Qadhadhfa, [15] who were Arab in heritage His mother was named Aisha bin Niran (died 1978), and his father, Mohammad Abdul Salam bin Hamed bin Mohammad, was known as Abu Meniar (died 1985); the latter earned a meager subsistence as a goat and camel herder [16]\n\n\nEducation and political activism: 1950–1963\nGaddafi's earliest education was of a religious nature, imparted by a local Islamic teacher [25] Subsequently, moving to nearby Sirte to attend elementary school, he progressed through six grades in four years [26] Education in Libya was not free, but his father thought it would greatly benefit his son despite the financial strain During the week Gaddafi slept in a mosque, and only at weekends and holidays walked 20 miles (32 km) to visit his parents Even though Gaddafi's father was not educated, he made great sacrifices to send his son to school [27] As an impoverished Bedouin, he faced bullying and discrimination from his city-dwelling classmates However, he had many Egyptian teachers who informed him of the dramatic events occurring in their homeland [26] From Sirte, he and his family moved to the market town of Sabha in Fezzan, south-central Libya, where his father worked as a caretaker for a tribal leader while Muammar attended secondary school, something neither parent had done [28] Gaddafi was popular at this school; some friends made there received significant jobs in his later administration, most notably his best friend, Abdul Salam Jalloud [29]\n\n\nMilitary training: 1963–1966\nGaddafi briefly studied history at the University of Libya in Benghazi before dropping out to join the military [39] Despite his police record, in 1963 he began training at the Royal Military Academy, Benghazi, alongside several like-minded friends from Misrata The armed forces offered the only opportunity for upward social mobility for underprivileged Libyans, and Gaddafi recognized it as a potential instrument of political change [40] Under Idris, Libya's armed forces were trained by the British military; this angered Gaddafi, who viewed the British as imperialists, and accordingly, he refused to learn English and was rude to the British officers, ultimately failing his exams [41] British trainers reported him for insubordination and abusive behaviour, stating their suspicion that he was involved in the assassination of the military academy's commander in 1963 Such reports were ignored, and Gaddafi quickly progressed through the course [contradictory] [42]\n\n\nLibyan Arab Republic\nPeople of Libya!

incitement to rebel, your armed forces have undertaken the overthrow of the corrupt regime, the stench of which has sickened and horrified us all At a single blow our gallant army has toppled these idols and has destroyed their images By a single stroke it has lightened the long dark night in which the Turkish domination was followed first by Italian rule, then by this reactionary and decadent regime which was no more than a hotbed of extortion, faction, treachery and treason.\n\n\nConsolidating leadership: 1969–1973\nThe 12-member central committee of the Free Officers proclaimed themselves the Revolutionary Command Council (RCC), the government of the new republic [69] Lieutenant Gaddafi became RCC chairman, and therefore the de facto head of state, also appointing himself to the rank of colonel and becoming commander-in-chief of the armed forces [70] Jalloud became Prime Minister, [71] while a civilian Council of Ministers headed by Sulaiman Maghribi was founded to implement RCC policy [72] Libya's administrative capital was moved from al-Beida to Tripoli [73]\n\n\nEconomic and social reform\nThe RCC's early economic policy has been characterized as being state capitalist in orientation [88] Many initiatives were established to aid entrepreneurs and develop a Libyan bourgeoisie [89] Seeking to expand the cultivatable acreage in Libya, in September 1969 the government launched a \"Green Revolution\" to increase agricultural productivity so that Libya could rely less on imported food [90] The hope was to make Libya self-sufficient in food production [91] All land that had either been expropriated from Italian settlers or which was not in use was repossessed and redistributed [92] Irrigation systems were established along the northern coastline and around various inland oases [93] Production costs often surpassed the value of the produce and thus Libyan agricultural production remained in deficit, relying heavily on state subsidies [94]\n\n\nForeign relations\nFollowing Anwar Sadat's ascension to the Egyptian presidency, Libya's relations with Egypt deteriorated [192] Over the coming years, the two slipped into a state of cold war [193] Sadat was perturbed by Gaddafi's unpredictability and insistence that Egypt required a cultural revolution akin to that being carried out in Libya [192] In February 1973, Israeli forces shot down Libyan Arab Airlines Flight 114, which had strayed from Egyptian airspace into Israeli-held territory during a sandstorm Gaddafi's foreign minister Salah Busir was on board and allegedly targeted by Israel in retaliation for the Munich massacre [194] Gaddafi was infuriated that Egypt had not done more to prevent the incident, and in retaliation planned to destroy the Queen Elizabeth 2, a British ship chartered by American Jews to sail to Haifa for Israel's 25th anniversary Gaddafi ordered an Egyptian submarine to target the ship, but Sadat cancelled the order, fearing a military escalation [195]\n\n\nThe \"Popular Revolution\": 1973–1977\nOn 16 April 1973, Gaddafi proclaimed the start of a \"Popular Revolution\" in a speech at Zuwarah [154] He initiated this with a five-point plan, the first point of which dissolved all existing laws, to be replaced by revolutionary enactments The second point proclaimed that all opponents of the revolution had to be removed, while the third initiated an administrative revolution that Gaddafi proclaimed would remove all traces of bureaucracy and the bourgeoisie The fourth point announced that the population must form People's Committees and be armed to defend the revolution, while the fifth proclaimed the beginning of the Cultural Revolution in Libya, to expunge the country of \"poisonous\" foreign influences [155] He began to lecture on this new phase of the revolution in Libya, Egypt, and France [156] As a process, it had many similarities with the Cultural Revolution implemented in China [157]\n\n\nThird International Theory and The Green Book\nIn June 1973, Gaddafi created a political ideology as a basis for the Popular Revolution: Third International Theory This approach regarded both the US and the Soviet Union as imperialist and thus rejected Western capitalism as well as Marxist–Leninist atheism [166] In this respect, it was similar to the Three Worlds Theory developed by China's political leader Mao Zedong [167] As part of this theory, Gaddafi praised nationalism as a progressive force and advocated the creation of a pan-Arab state which would lead the Islamic and Third Worlds against imperialism [168] Gaddafi saw Islam as having a key role in this ideology, calling for an Islamic revival that returned to the origins of the Qur'an, rejecting scholarly interpretations and the Hadith; in doing so, he angered many Libyan clerics [169] During 1973 and 1974, his government deepened the legal reliance on sharia, for instance by introducing flogging as punishment for those convicted of adultery or homosexual activity [170]\n\n\nForeign relations\nFollowing Anwar Sadat's ascension to the Egyptian presidency, Libya's relations with Egypt deteriorated [192] Over the coming years, the two slipped into a state of cold war [193] Sadat was perturbed by Gaddafi's unpredictability and insistence that Egypt required a cultural revolution akin to that being carried out in Libya

planned to destroy the Queen Elizabeth 2, a British ship chartered by American Jews to sail to Haifa for Israel's 25th anniversary Gaddafi ordered an Egyptian submarine to target the ship, but Sadat cancelled the order, fearing a military escalation [195]\n\n\nGreat Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya\nOn 2 March 1977, the General People's Congress adopted the \"Declaration on the Establishment of the Authority of the People\" at Gaddafi's behest Dissolving the Libyan Arab Republic, it was replaced by the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya (Arabic: الجماهيرية العربية الليبية الشعبية الاشتراكية, al-Jamāhīrīyah al-‘Arabīyah al-Lībīyah ash-Sha‘bīyah al-Ishtirākīyah), a \"state of the masses\" conceptualized by Gaddafi [216] A new, all-green banner was adopted as the country's flag [217] Officially, the Jamahiriya was a direct democracy in which the people ruled themselves through the 187 Basic People's Congresses (BPCs), where all adult Libyans participated and voted on national decisions These then sent members to the annual General People's Congress, which was broadcast live on television In principle, the People's Congresses were Libya's highest authority, with major decisions proposed by government officials or with Gaddafi himself requiring the consent of the People's Congresses [218] Gaddafi became General Secretary of the GPC, although he stepped down from this position in early 1979 and appointed himself \"Leader of the Revolution\" [219]\n\n\nFoundation: 1977\nOn 2 March 1977, the General People's Congress adopted the \"Declaration on the Establishment of the Authority of the People\" at Gaddafi's behest Dissolving the Libyan Arab Republic, it was replaced by the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya (Arabic: الجماهيرية العربية الليبية الشعبية الاشتراكية, al-Jamāhīrīyah al-‘Arabīyah al-Lībīyah ash-Sha‘bīyah al-Ishtirākīyah), a \"state of the masses\" conceptualized by Gaddafi [216] A new,

Secretary of the GPC, although he stepped down from this position in early 1979 and appointed himself \"Leader of the Revolution\" [219]\n\n\nRevolutionary Committees and furthering socialism: 1978–1980\nIf socialism is defined as a redistribution of wealth and resources, a socialist revolution clearly occurred in Libya after 1969 and most especially in the second half of the 1970s The management of the economy was increasingly socialist in intent and effect with wealth in housing, capital and land significantly redistributed or in the process of redistribution Private enterprise was virtually eliminated, largely replaced by a centrally controlled economy.\n\n\nConflict with the US and its allies: 1981–1986\nThe early 80s saw economic trouble in Libya; from 1982 to 1986, annual oil revenues dropped from $21 to $5.4 billion [274] Focusing on irrigation projects, 1983 saw construction start on Libya's largest and most expensive infrastructure project, the Great Man-Made River; although designed to be finished by the end of the decade, it remained incomplete at the start of the 21st century [275] Military spending increased, while other administrative budgets were cut [276] Foreign debt rose, [277] and austerity measures were introduced to promote self-reliance; in 1985 there was a mass deportation of foreign workers, mostly Egyptian and Tunisian [278] Domestic threats continued to plague Gaddafi; in May 1984, his Bab al-Azizia home was unsuccessfully attacked by a militia—linked to the NFSL or Muslim Brotherhood—and in the aftermath 5,000 dissidents were arrested [279] In spring 1985, members of the military tried to assassinate Gaddafi twice The first was a plot by conservative officers to assassinate him at a villa on the outskirts of Tripoli; the second was an assault on his convoy [280] In November 1985, Colonel Hassan Ishkal, the third most powerful man in Libya, head of the military region of Sirte, died in a suspicious car accident Ishkal's death was attributed to Jalloud, Khalifa Hunaysh or Gaddafi [281] [282] [283]\n\n\n\"Revolution within a Revolution\": 1987–1998\nThe late 1980s saw a series of liberalizing economic reforms within Libya designed to cope with the decline in oil revenues In May 1987, Gaddafi announced the start of the \"Revolution within a Revolution\", which began with reforms to industry and agriculture and saw the re-opening of small business [321] Restrictions were placed on the activities of the Revolutionary Committees; in March 1988, their role was narrowed by the newly created Ministry for Mass Mobilization and Revolutionary Leadership to restrict their violence and judicial role, while in August 1988 Gaddafi publicly criticized them [322]\nIn March, hundreds of political prisoners were freed, with Gaddafi falsely claiming that there were no further political prisoners in Libya [323] In June, Libya's government issued the Great Green Charter on Human Rights in the Era of the Masses, in which 27 articles laid out goals, rights, and guarantees to improve the situation of human rights in Libya, restricting the use of the death penalty and calling for its eventual abolition Many of the measures suggested in the charter would be implemented the following year, although others remained inactive [324] Also in 1989, the government founded the Al-Gaddafi International Prize for Human Rights, to be awarded to figures from the Third World who had struggled against colonialism and imperialism; the first year's winner was South African anti-apartheid activist Nelson Mandela [325] From 1994 through to 1997, the government initiated cleansing committees to root out corruption, particularly in the economic sector [326]\n\n\nPan-Africanism, reconciliation and privatization: 1999–2011\nDuring the final years of the 20th century, Gaddafi—frustrated by the failure of his pan-Arab ideals and the refusal of the Arab world to challenge the international air embargo imposed on Libya—increasingly rejected Arab nationalism in favour of pan-Africanism, emphasizing Libya's African identity [354] [355] In a 1998 interview, Gaddafi claimed that \"the Arab world is finished\" and expressed his wish for Libya to become a \"black country.\" [355] From 1997 to 2000, Libya initiated cooperative agreements or bilateral aid arrangements with 10 African states, [356] and in 1999 joined the Community of Sahel-Saharan States [357] In June 1999, Gaddafi visited Mandela in South Africa, [358] and the following month attended the OAU summit in Algiers, calling for greater political and economic integration across the continent and advocating the foundation of a United States of Africa [359] He became one of the founders of the African Union (AU), initiated in July 2002 to replace the OAU At the opening ceremonies, he called for African states to reject conditional aid from the developed world, a direct contrast to the message of South African President Thabo Mbeki [360] There was speculation that Gaddafi wanted to become the AU's first chair, raising concerns within Africa that this would damage the Union's international standing, particularly with the West [361]\n\n\nLinks with Africa and conflicts in the Arab League\nDuring the final years of the 20th century, Gaddafi—frustrated by the failure of his pan-Arab ideals and the refusal of the Arab world to challenge the international air embargo imposed on Libya—increasingly rejected Arab nationalism in favour of pan-Africanism, emphasizing Libya's African identity [354] [355] In a 1998 interview, Gaddafi claimed that \"the Arab world is finished\" and expressed his wish for Libya to become a \"black country.\" [355] From 1997 to 2000, Libya initiated cooperative agreements or bilateral aid

international standing, particularly with the West [361]\n\n\nRebuilding links with the West\nIn 1999, Libya began secret talks with the British government to normalize relations [383] In 2001, Gaddafi publicly condemned the September 11 attacks on the US by al-Qaeda, expressing sympathy with the victims and calling for Libyan involvement in the US-led War on Terror against militant Islamism [384] His government continued suppressing domestic Islamism, at the same time as Gaddafi called for the wider application of sharia law [385] Libya also cemented connections with China and North Korea, being visited by Chinese President Jiang Zemin in April 2002 [386] However, relations with China became strained in May 2006 due to a visit to Tripoli by Taiwanese President Chen Shui-bian [387] [388] [389] Influenced by the events of the Iraq War, in December 2003, Libya renounced its possession of weapons of mass destruction, decommissioning its chemical and nuclear weapons programs [390] Relations with the US improved as a result [391] British Prime Minister Tony Blair visited Gaddafi in March 2004; [392] the pair developed close personal ties [393] In 2003, Libya paid US$2.7 billion to the families of the victims of the Lockerbie bombing as it was the condition the US and UK had made for terminating the remaining UN sanctions Libya continued to deny any role in the bombing [394] [395] In 2009, Gaddafi attempted to strong-arm global energy companies operating in Libya to cover Libya's settlement with the families of the victims of Lockerbie [396]\n\n\nEconomic reform\nLibya's economy witnessed increasing privatization; although rejecting the socialist policies of nationalized industry advocated in The Green Book, government figures asserted that they were forging \"people's socialism\" rather than capitalism [419] Gaddafi welcomed these reforms, calling for wide-scale privatization in a March 2003 speech; [420] he promised that Libya would join the World Trade Organization [421] These reforms encouraged private investment in Libya's economy [422] By 2004, there was US$40 billion of direct foreign investment in Libya, a six-fold rise over 2003 [423] Sectors of Libya's population reacted against these reforms with public demonstrations, [424] and in March 2006, revolutionary hard-liners took control of the GPC cabinet; although scaling back the pace of the changes, they did not halt them [425] In 2010, plans were announced that would have seen half the Libyan economy privatized over the following decade, [426] these plans appear to have been soon abandoned however, as the companies that the government stated they were going to float on the stock market, among them the National Commercial Bank and the Libyan Iron and Steel Company were never floated and remained 100% state-owned Many socialist policies remained however, with subsidiaries of logistics company HB Group being nationalized in 2007 [427] Agriculture remained largely untouched by the reforms, with farms remaining cooperatives, the Agricultural Bank of Libya remaining wholly state-owned and state interventionist policies and price controls remaining [428] The oil industry remained largely state-owned, with the wholly state-owned National Oil Corporation retaining a 70% share in Libya's oil industry, the government also imposed a 93% tax on all oil that foreign companies produced in Libya [429] Price controls and subsidies over oil and food remained in place, and state-provided benefits such as free education, universal healthcare, free housing, free water and free electricity remained in place [430] Libya also changed its stance on the WTO after the removal of technocrat Shukri Ghanem, with Gaddafi condemning the WTO as a neocolonial terrorist organisation, and urging African and Third World countries not to join it [431]\n\n\nLibyan Civil War and assassination\nFollowing the start of the Arab Spring in 2011, Gaddafi spoke out in favour of Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, then threatened by the Tunisian Revolution He suggested that Tunisia's people would be satisfied if Ben Ali introduced a Jamahiriyah system there [436] Fearing domestic protest, Libya's government implemented preventive measures by reducing food prices, purging the army leadership of potential defectors, and releasing several Islamist prisoners [437] This proved ineffective, and on 17 February 2011, major protests broke out against Gaddafi's government Unlike Tunisia or Egypt, Libya was largely religiously homogeneous and had no strong Islamist movement, but there was widespread dissatisfaction with the corruption and entrenched systems of patronage, while unemployment had reached around 30 percent [438]\n\n\nOrigins and development: February–August 2011\nFollowing the start of the Arab Spring in 2011, Gaddafi spoke out in favour of Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, then threatened by the Tunisian Revolution He suggested that Tunisia's people would be satisfied if Ben Ali introduced a Jamahiriyah system there [436] Fearing domestic protest, Libya's government implemented preventive measures by reducing food prices, purging the army leadership of potential defectors, and releasing several Islamist prisoners [437] This proved ineffective, and on 17 February 2011, major protests broke out against Gaddafi's government Unlike Tunisia or Egypt, Libya was largely religiously homogeneous and had no strong Islamist movement, but there was widespread dissatisfaction with the corruption and entrenched systems of patronage, while unemployment had reached around 30 percent [438]\n\n\nCapture and killing\nAfter the fall of Tripoli, only a few towns in western Libya such as Bani Walid, Sebha, and Sirte remained Gaddafist strongholds [456] Gaddafi was reportedly planning to catch up with his Sebha commander Ali Kanna's Tuareg forces and seek asylum in Burkina Faso [458] Instead, Gaddafi retreated to his hometown of Sirte, [459] where he convened a meeting with his son Mutassim and intelligence chief Abdullah Senussi and learned that his youngest son Khamis had been killed by a NATO airstrike on 29 August [460] In the weeks that followed, Gaddafi continued to broadcast defiant audio messages through Syria-based Arrai TV [461] [462] [456] On 10 September, General Massoud Abdel Hafiz announced the formation of the Republic of Fezzan in Sebha, where Gaddafi would be president for life [463] Sebha fell on 22 September [464]\n\n\nPolitical ideology\nWe call it the Third  [International] Theory to indicate that there is a new path for all those who reject both materialist capitalism and atheist communism The path is for all the people of the world who abhor the dangerous confrontation between the Warsaw and North Atlantic military alliances It is for all those who believe that all nations of the world are brothers under the aegis of the rule of God.\n\n\nIslamic modernism and Islamic socialism\nGaddafi rejected the secularist approach to Arab nationalism that had been pervasive in Syria, [510] with his revolutionary movement placing a far stronger emphasis on Islam than previous Arab nationalist movements had done [511] He deemed Arabism and Islam to be inseparable, referring to them as \"one and indivisible\", [512] and called on the Arab world's Christian minority to convert to Islam [513] He insisted that Islamic law should be the basis for the law of the state, blurring any distinction between the religious and secular realms [514] He desired unity across the Islamic world, [515] and encouraged the propagation of the faith elsewhere; on a 2010 visit to Italy, he paid a modelling agency to find 200 young Italian women for a lecture he gave urging them to convert [516] According to the Gaddafi biographer Jonathan Bearman, in Islamic terms Gaddafi was a modernist rather than a fundamentalist, for he subordinated religion to the political system rather than seeking to Islamicise the state as Islamists sought to do [517] He was driven by a sense of \"divine mission\", believing himself a conduit of God's will, and thought that he must achieve his goals \"no matter what the cost\" [518] His interpretation of Islam was nevertheless idiosyncratic, [517] and he clashed with conservative Libyan clerics Many criticized his attempts to encourage women to enter traditionally male-only sectors of society, such as the armed forces Gaddafi was keen to improve women's status, although saw the sexes as \"separate but equal\" and therefore felt women should usually remain in traditional roles [519]\n\n\nPersonal life\nA very private individual, [485] Gaddafi was given to rumination and solitude and could be reclusive [533] Gaddafi described himself as a \"simple revolutionary\" and \"pious Muslim\" called upon by God to continue Nasser's work [534] Gaddafi was an austere and devout Muslim, [535] although according to Vandewalle, his interpretation of Islam was \"deeply personal and idiosyncratic.\" [235] He was also a football enthusiast [536] and enjoyed both playing the sport and horse riding as a means of recreation [537] He regarded himself as an intellectual; [538] he was a fan of Beethoven and said his favourite novels were Uncle Tom's Cabin, Roots, and The Outsider [536]\n\n\nPublic life\nAccording to Vandewalle, Gaddafi \"dominated  [Libya's] political life\" during his period in power [563] The sociologist Raymond A Hinnebusch described the Libyan as \"perhaps the most exemplary contemporary case of the politics of charismatic leadership\", displaying all of the traits of charismatic authority outlined by the sociologist Max Weber [564] According to Hinnebusch, the foundations of Gaddafi's \"personal charismatic authority\" in Libya stemmed from the blessing he had received from Nasser coupled with \"nationalist achievements\" such as the expulsion of foreign military bases, the extraction of higher prices for Libyan oil, and his vocal support for the Palestinian and other anti-imperialist causes [565]\n\n\nAwards and honours\nSupporters praised Gaddafi's administration for the creation of a more equal society through domestic reform [575] They stressed the regime's achievements in combating homelessness, ensuring access to food and safe drinking water, and to dramatic improvements in education [575] Supporters have also applauded achievements in medical care, praising the universal free healthcare provided under the Gaddafist administration, with diseases like cholera and typhoid being contained and life expectancy raised [575]\n\n\nReception and legacy\nSupporters praised Gaddafi's administration for the creation of a more equal society through domestic reform [575] They

[575]\n\n\nPosthumous assessment\nInternational reactions to Gaddafi's death were divided [580] Gaddafi was mourned as a hero by many across sub-Saharan Africa but was widely condemned elsewhere

The list of country calling codes is a table that shows the country codes for each country in the world, organized by world zone and alphabetical order.\n\n**Overview**\n\nThe ITU (International Telecommunication Union) has assigned country codes to each country in the world, which are used to identify the country or region that a telephone number belongs to. The country codes are usually three-digit numbers, but some countries have been assigned two-digit codes due to their geographical location or historical alignment.\n\nThe country codes are generally organized geographically, with exceptions for political and historical alignment. The nine world zones are:\n\n* Zone 1: North American Numbering Plan (NANP)\n* Zone 2: Mostly Africa\n* Zones 3–4: Europe\n* Zone 5: South and Central Americas\n* Zone 6: Southeast Asia and Oceania\n* Zone 7: Russia and neighboring regions\n* Zone 8: East Asia, South Asia, and special services\n* Zone 9: West, Central, and South Asia, and part of Eastern Europe\n\n**Ordered by World Zone**\n\n### Zone 1: North American Numbering Plan (NANP)\n\nThe NANP is a telephone numbering plan that is used in North America, including the United States, Canada, and some Caribbean islands. The country code for the NANP is 1, and the three-digit numbering plan area (NPA) codes are assigned under this prefix. The NPA codes are usually three-digit numbers, but some areas have been assigned four-digit codes.\n\n| Last Digit | Country/Region |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1 | Canada |\n| 1 | United States |\n| 1 | Anguilla |\n| 1 | Bermuda |\n| 1 | British Virgin Islands |\n| 1 | Cayman Islands |\n| 1 | Grenada |\n| 1 | Montserrat |\n| 1 | Puerto Rico |\n| 1 | Saint Kitts and Nevis |\n| 1 | Saint Lucia |\n| 1 | Saint Vincent and the Grenadines |\n| 1 | Turks and Caicos Islands |\n\n### Zone 2: Mostly Africa\n\nThe country codes for Africa are generally assigned to the west and central regions of the continent.

He was a vocal advocate for the rights of the Adivasi community and a critic of the government's policies towards them. Swamy's work and activism led to his arrest and detention under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967. He was a winner of the Mukundan C Menon award 2020 for human rights.\n\n**Life**\n\nStan Swamy was born on 26 April 1937 in Viragalur, a village in present-day Tiruchirappalli district, Tamil Nadu, India. His birthplace is a small village surrounded by rural landscape and dense forests, which would later become an inspiration for his work among the tribals.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nSwamy's early life and education laid the foundation for his future career as a Jesuit priest and activist. He was born into a family of modest means, but his parents valued education and encouraged him to pursue his studies. Swamy's initial education took place in a local school in Viragalur, where he developed a strong interest in social justice and the rights of the marginalized.\n\nAfter completing his secondary education, Swamy joined the Jesuit order and began his formation as a priest. He pursued his higher studies in Bangalore, where he earned a degree in philosophy and later in theology. His academic pursuits deepened his understanding of social justice and human rights, which would become the core of his activism.\n\n**Activism**\n\nSwamy's activism began in the 1970s, when he worked among the tribals of central India. He was the director of the Jesuit-run Indian Social Institute, Bangalore, from 1975 to 1986. During this period, he was instrumental in setting up various projects and programs aimed at empowering the Adivasi community. Swamy worked tirelessly to address the social, economic, and cultural issues faced by the tribals, including poverty, education, healthcare, and land rights.\n\nOne of his notable contributions was his advocacy for the implementation of the Fifth Schedule of the Constitution, which stipulates the setting up of a Tribes Advisory Council with members solely of the Adivasi community for their protection, well-being, and development in the state. Swamy's efforts led to the establishment of several Tribes Advisory Councils in various states, which provided a platform for the Adivasi community to have a say in their development and governance.\n\n**Arrest**\n\nSwamy's arrest took place on 8 October 2020, when he was taken into custody by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) from Bagaicha, a Jesuit social action centre. He was charged under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, under which bail can be denied. The case was initially investigated by the Pune Police but later handed over to the NIA.\n\nSwamy was accused of being a Maoist sympathizer and was implicated in the 2018 Bhima Koregaon violence. He claimed that he was not in Pune during the said period and denied any involvement with the Maoists. The Jesuits denied the allegation of Swamy being a Maoist, stating that it was against the ethos of the Jesuit order.\n\n**Illness and Death**\n\nSwamy suffered from Parkinson's disease and other age-related illnesses. He fell multiple times while in prison, which made his imprisonment even more challenging. He suffered from hearing loss in both ears and had undergone surgeries. Due to his Parkinson's, he had trouble holding a glass, and requested to be provided with a sipper and a straw while imprisoned.\n\n**Awards**\n\nIn January 2021, Swamy was awarded the Mukundan C Menon award 2020 for human rights. This award recognized his lifetime of service to the Adivasi community and his commitment to human rights and social justice.\n\n**References**\n\nExternal links\n\n* \"Stan Swamy, Jesuit Priest, Arrested in India Over Maoist Links\".

Born on 1 February 1947 in Trollhättan, Sweden, Olofsson's life was marked by a series of crimes and a tumultuous personal life.\n\n**Early Years**\n\nOlofsson was born into a family with extensive alcohol problems. His mother, a cashier, and father, an asphalt worker, struggled with addiction, which led to the family's instability. When Olofsson was 11 years old, his father left the family, and his mother soon fell ill, requiring hospitalization. This led to Olofsson and his two younger sisters being placed in foster care. However, Olofsson was unhappy in his foster family and sought to escape. At the age of 14, he forged his mother's signature and enrolled in a sailors' school, where he sailed around the world on the ship Ballade.\n\n**1960s-1980s**\n\nAs a teenager, Olofsson was involved in petty crimes and, at the age of 16, was placed in a behavioral institution for young offenders. In August 1965, he escaped from the institution with two other boys and entered the country estate of Swedish Prime Minister Tage Erlander, where they stole grapes, cucumbers, and tomatoes from the greenhouse. Three months later, Olofsson assaulted two police officers in Eskilstuna. On 4 February 1966, he was sentenced to three years in prison, marking his first real prison sentence.\n\nIn late 1966, Olofsson made his first escape from the prison at Tidaholm. In 1973, while incarcerated at the Norrköping Prison, bank robber Jan-Erik Olsson took hostages at Kreditbanken at Norrmalmstorg, Stockholm. Olsson demanded that Olofsson be brought to the bank, where he spent six days with the hostages. This event led to the creation of the phrase \"Stockholm syndrome.\" Olofsson was convicted in the district court but was later acquitted in Svea Court of Appeal.\n\n**Fugitive, New Sentences, and Marriage**\n\nOn 20 March 1975, Olofsson escaped from the Norrköping prison. In April that year, he robbed a bank in Copenhagen, firing a warning shot and making off with SEK194,000. In August, he sailed around the Mediterranean with a companion, buying a sailboat and passing through the Strait of Gibraltar. With the help of friends, Olofsson eventually returned to Sweden. On 24 March 1976, he robbed Handelsbanken on Östra Hamngatan 27 in Gothenburg, taking two people hostage and making off with SEK930,000. He was arrested nine hours later and sentenced to eight years in prison.\n\nHowever, in July 1976, Olofsson escaped again, this time by driving a Scania truck through three prison gates at Norrköping Prison. On 31 July 1976, he was arrested in Halmstad, and on 12 August 1976, he married Belgian national Marijke Demuynck in Kumla Prison.\n\n**1990s-2010s**\n\nOn 10 October 1991, Olofsson was released and changed his name to Daniel Demuynck. He moved to the Belgian countryside, 80 km outside Brussels. In July 1996, he was arrested outside a bank in Oslo, but released after 24 hours. On a stormy November night, he was rescued by a sea rescue helicopter off the coast of Halland after his wooden boat was smashed against the rocks. A few weeks later, he was taken into custody for drunk driving in Stockholm.\n\nOn 15 April 1998, Olofsson was arrested in Tenerife as the head of a drug smuggling operation. He was extradited to Denmark and sentenced in 1999 to 14 years in prison for smuggling 49 kilos of amphetamine into Denmark. While in Denmark, he was held in the isolation ward at Vestre Prison in Copenhagen. He was released on parole on 9 May 2005.\n\n**New Drug Smuggling Conviction and Deportation to Belgium**\n\nOn 19 July 2008, Olofsson and three other people were arrested next to Apelviken's campsite in Varberg. The police had been tracking them for eight months, suspecting them of being involved in a large drug operation. A total of six people were arrested in Stockholm and Varberg on suspicion of serious drug offenses. Olofsson was charged with trying to smuggle in 100 kilos of amphetamine and 76 kilos of cannabis from the Netherlands. He was sentenced to 14 years in prison and lifetime deportation by the Linköping District Court.\n\n**Release**\n\nAfter a negotiation on conditional release in Belgium, Olofsson was released on 30 July 2018.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nOlofsson became engaged to Madiorie Britmer in prison in 1967. He married Marijke from Belgium in 1976, and they had three children together. The marriage ended in 1999. Olofsson also has two daughters from before his marriage.

{"title": "Seeress_(Germanic)", "content": "\nNames and terminology\nAside from the names of individuals, Roman era accounts do not contain information about how the early Germanic peoples referred to them, but sixth century Goth scholar Jordanes reported in his Getica that the early Goths had called their seeresses haliurunnae (Goth-Latin) [2] The word also appears in Old English (OE), hellerune (\"seeress\" or \"witch\") and in Old High German (OHG) as hellirûna (\"necromancy\") and hellirunari (\"necromancer\"), [3] [4] and from these forms an earlier Proto-Germanic form *χalja-rūnō(n) has been reconstructed, [5] in which the first element is *χaljō, i.e Hel, the abode of the dead, [6] and the second is *rūnō (\"mystery, secret\") [7] At this time the word *rūnō still referred to chanting and not to letters (rune), [4] and in the sense \"incantation\" it was probably borrowed from Proto-Germanic into Finnish where runo means \"poem\" [8]\n\n\nThe term shamanism\nThere has long been an academic debate on whether the seeresses' practice should be regarded as shamanism However, this does not pertain to the concept of shamanism in a wider definition (see e.g the definitions of the OED), but rather to what degree similarities can be found between what is preserved about them in Old Norse literature and the shamanism of northern Eurasia in a more restricted sense The majority of scholars support the \"shamanic interpretation, and the presence of ecstatic rituals\" (e.g Ellis Davidson, Ohlmarks, Pálsson, Meulengracht Sørensen, Turville-Petre and de Vries), while a minority is skeptical (e.g Bugge, Dillmann, Dumézil, Näsström and Schjødt), but there are divergent opinions within the two camps [25] Clive Tolley, who is among the sceptics, writes that if shamanism is defined as \"tundra shamanism\" as represented by the Sámi of Scandinavia and as defined by Edward Vajda, then the differences are too great He allies himself with the position of Ohlmarks, who was familiar with a wide range shamanism and rejected it in 1939, in a debate with Dag Strömbäck who found similarities with Sámi practices However, Tolley concedes that if shamanism is defined in line with the words of Åke Hultkrantz (1993) as \" [...] direct contact with spiritual beings and guardian spirits, together with the mediating role played by a shaman in a ritual setting  [...] The presence of guardian spirits during the trance and following shamanic actions  [...]\" then it is correct to define their practices as \"broadly shamanic\" However, he considers that in this case shamanism also includes traditional practices from a large part of Europe, such as the witchcraft of medieval Europe and the practices of ancient Greece [26] An opposing view is held by Neil Price, who has studied circumpolar shamanism, and argues that he finds enough similarities to define the North Germanic seeresses as shamans also in the stricter sense [27]\n\n\nRole in society\nFate is central in Germanic literature and mythology, and men's destiny is inextricably linked to supernatural women and seeresses Morris comments that the importance of fate can not be overstressed, and the seeresses were feared and revered by gods and mortals alike Even the god Odin himself consulted them The Norns are an example of the link between women and fate, which was elevated in Germanic society, and the association was incarnated by the seeresses [28]\n\n\nAttestations\nGermanic seeresses are first described by the Romans, who discuss the role seeresses played in Germanic society A gap in the historical record occurs until the North Germanic record began over a millennium later, when the Old Norse sagas frequently mention seeresses among the North Germanic peoples It is noteworthy that Veleda, who prophesied in a high tower in the first century, finds an echo in the thirteenth-century account of Þorbjörg lítilvölva who prophesied from a raised platform in Eiríks saga rauða [38] Simek comments that the saga's account of Þorbjörg's raised platform and her wand conveys authentic practices from Germanic paganism [39]\n\n\nRoman Era\nIn his ethnography of the ancient Germanic peoples, Germania, Tacitus expounds on some of these points In chapter eight, he reports the following about women in then-contemporary Germanic society and the role of seeresses:\n\n\nAlbruna\nIn the first and second centuries CE, Greek and Roman authors—such as Greek historian Strabo, Roman senator Tacitus, and Roman historian Cassius Dio—wrote about the ancient Germanic peoples, and made note of the role of seeresses in Germanic society Tacitus mentions Germanic seeresses in book 4 of his first century CE Histories.\n\n\nVeleda\nIn the first and second centuries CE, Greek and Roman authors—such as Greek historian Strabo, Roman senator Tacitus, and Roman historian Cassius Dio—wrote about the ancient Germanic peoples, and made note of the role of seeresses in Germanic society Tacitus mentions Germanic seeresses in book 4 of his first century CE Histories.\n\n\nGanna\nA seeress named Ganna is mentioned by the Roman historiographer Cassius Dio in the early 3rd century The context is the campaign east of the Rhine by Emperor Domitian in the 80s of the 1st century CE Ganna belonged to a tribe called the Semnones who were settled east of the river Elbe, and she appears to have been active in the second half of the 1st century, after Veleda's time [30] Ganna's political influence was considerable enough that she was taken to Rome together with Masyos, the king of her tribe, where they had an audience with the Roman emperor and were treated with honours, after which they returned home [30] [31] This probably happened in 86 AD, the year after his final war with the Chatti, when he made a treaty with the Cherusci, who were settled between the rivers Weser and the Elbe [30]\n\n\nWaluburg\nDating from the second century CE, an ostracon with a Greek inscription reading Waluburg Se [m]noni Sibylla (Greek 'Waluburg, sibyl from the Semnones') was discovered in the early twentieth century on Elephantine, an Egyptian island The name occurs among a list of Roman and Graeco-Egyptian soldier names, perhaps indicating its use as a payroll [50]\n\n\nEarly Middle Ages\nThe Origo Gentis Langobardorum (Origin of the Lombard/Langobard people), a seventh-century Latin account, and the Historia Langobardorum (History of the Lombard/Langobards), from the 8th c., relate the legend that before, or after, the Langobard people, then known as the Winnili, emigrated from Scandinavia, led by the brothers Ibor and Agio, their neighbours, the Vandals, demanded that they pay tribute, but their mother Gambara advised them not to Before the battle, the Vandals called on Odin (Godan [58]) to give them victory, but Gambara invoked Odin's wife Frigg (Frea) instead [59] Frigg advised them to trick Odin, by having the Winnili women spread their hair in front of their faces so as to look bearded and stand before the window from which Odin looked down on Earth [60] Odin was embarrassed and asked who the \"long-beards\" (longobarbae [58]) were, and thus naming them he became their godfather and had to grant them victory [61]\n\n\nGambara\nThe Origo Gentis Langobardorum (Origin of the Lombard/Langobard people), a seventh-century Latin account, and the Historia Langobardorum (History of the Lombard/Langobards), from the 8th c., relate the legend that before, or after, the Langobard people, then known as the Winnili, emigrated from Scandinavia, led by the brothers Ibor and Agio, their neighbours, the Vandals, demanded that they pay tribute, but their mother Gambara advised them not to Before the battle, the Vandals called on

faces so as to look bearded and stand before the window from which Odin looked down on Earth [60] Odin was embarrassed and asked who the \"long-beards\" (longobarbae [58]) were, and thus naming them he became their godfather and had to grant them victory [61]\n\n\nHaliurunas\nGetica, a 6th century work on the history of the Goths, reports that the early Goths had called their seeresses haliurunas (or haliurunnae, etc.) (Goth-Latin) [2] They were in the words of Wolfram \"women who engaged in magic with the world of the dead\", and they were banished from their tribe by Filimer who was the last pre-Amal dynasty king of the migrating Goths [75] They found refuge in the wilderness where they were impregnated by unclean spirits from the Steppe, and engendered the Huns, which Pohl compares with the origin of the Sarmatians as presented by Herodotus [76] The account serves as an explanation for the origins of the Huns [77]\n\n\nNorth Germanic corpus\nFew records of myths among the Germanic peoples survive to modern times The North Germanic record is an exception, containing the vast majority of material that survives about the mythology of the Germanic peoples These sources mention numerous seeresses among the North Germanic peoples, including the following:\n\n\nOlga of Kiev\nThere are indications that Olga of Kiev may have served as a Völva, and as a \"priestess of Freyja\", before converting to Christianity [73] In the Primary Chronicle, she is described by the noblemen as the \"wisest of all women\", where wise has several meanings and her reputation as being wise goes back to her pre-conversion years [85] Her wisdom is also reported by Óláfs saga Tryggvassonar, where she is called Allogia and mistaken for Vladimir the Great's old mother, although she was his grand-mother There she is described as \"very wise\" and her main function at the court was as a prophetess, one whose predictions also came true When the king of Kievan Rus' celebrated Yule, he asked her to predict the future and to do so she was carried to him on a chair which recalls the elevated platforms of the seeresses Although he may not have transmitted a historical event, Oddr Snorrason, who wrote the saga in the 12th c., clearly identified Olga as a völva [86]\n\n\nArchaeological Record\nThe archaeological record for Viking Age society features a variety of graves that are identified as those of North Germanic seeresses A notable example occurs at Fyrkat, in the northern Jutland region of Denmark Fyrkat is the site of a former Viking Age ring fortress; the cemetery section of the site contains, among about 30 others, the grave of a woman buried within a horse-drawn carriage and wearing a red and blue dress embroidered with gold thread, all signs of high status While the grave contains items commonly found in female Viking Age graves such as scissors and spindle whorls, it also contains a variety of other rare and exotic items For example, the woman wore silver toe rings (otherwise unknown in the Scandinavian record) and her burial contained two bronze bowls originating from Central Asia [100]\n\n\nActivities\nIn Scandinavian sources, seeresses work as diviners using a practice called seiðr on a ritual platform called seiðhjallr (see below), which is associated with shamanism They also take part in other activities, but they do not appear to perform sacrifices They are described as ritual specialists travelling from settlement to settlement, sometimes with a group of followers, and late sources tell that they received payment for their services [102]\n\n\nChanting\nIn the Roman era, the Germanic word for chanting was similar to the reconstructed Proto-Germanic form *ʒalđran, which later evolved into Old Norse galdr (\"song, charm; witchcraft, sorcery\"), OHG galtar (\"incantation, charm\") and Old English ʒealdor with the same meaning, [103] also rendered as galdor (\"sound, song, incantation, spell, enchantment\") [104] It is derived from *ʒalanan, which became ON gala (\"to crow, sing\"), OHG galan (\"to incantate\") and OE ʒalan (\"to sing\") [105] It is related to the English nightingale and yell, to Latin gallus (\"cock\") and it appears in ON gylfra (\"witch\") [104] The many uses of chanting are revealed in the words that are derived from galdr, such as galdrabók (\"book of magic\"), galdrasmiðja (\"objects used for magic\"), galdravél (\"a magic device\"), galdrahríð (\"magic storm\"), galdrastafir (\"magical characters\") and valgaldr (a kind of Odinic necromancy) [106] The modern Swedish word galen (\"crazy\", literally \"having been chanted\") is derived from the word for this practice [107]\n\n\nSummoning\nWhile the varðlok(k)ur (mentioned above) attracted protective spirits that provided information to the enchantress, there were animal spirits that were sent out to collect information for her, and to perform other tasks [115] Consequently, the task of the sorceress was to control spirits, [116] and the name that appears to have been used for these spirits and for several other aspects in sorcery is gandr (pl gandir); the relationship between the extended meanings of gandr is complex and a matter of discussion among scholars [117] [118] The original meaning appears to be \"something which is connected with the soul of the magician and can be sent out from him or her in sleep or ecstasy\" [118]\n\n\nProphesying\nThere are two ways in which the seeress conveys the acquired information to the audience One of them is by having a seizure during the trance and gasping for air with a wide open mouth (Hrólfs saga kraka and Hauks þáttr hábrókar) She delivers her prophesy during the trance, and it may be said that a song appears from elsewhere in her mouth (Ǫrvar-Odds saga and Hrólfs saga kraka) [127] In Hrólfs saga kraka, it is in the beginning of the trance that she breathes in, and Tolley considers that this may represent a breathing in of spirits rather than her letting out her soul [128] Price comments that as far as textual criticism is concerned, this detail can not have been borrowed from those of the neighbouring Fenno-Ugric peoples, because the closest practitioners are the Yukaghir people on the other side of Eurasia, whose practices were inaccessible for the saga writers [129]\n\n\nAttributes\nThere appears to be a continuity between elements such as the first century Bructerian seeress Veleda's tower and the seiðhjallr that played an important role in Scandinavian sources [130] The word seiðhjallr means \"incantation scaffold\", for performing magic [104]\n\n\nWands\nThere appears to be a continuity between elements such as the first century Bructerian seeress Veleda's tower and the seiðhjallr that played an important role in Scandinavian sources [130] The word seiðhjallr means \"incantation scaffold\", for performing magic [104]\n\n\nPlatforms\nThere appears to be a continuity between elements such as the first century Bructerian seeress Veleda's tower and the seiðhjallr that played an important role in Scandinavian sources [130] The word seiðhjallr means \"incantation scaffold\", for performing magic [104]\n\n\nHallucinogens\nThe notion of ecstatic experience induced or complemented by the use of intoxicants in the context of Nordic pagan religion is not new, and there have been several attempts to reconstruct such practices Little evidence to confirm the Viking Age ingestion of hallucinogens such as psilocybin mushrooms or other entheogens has been found, with the exception of two archaeological finds: [131]\n\n\nCats\nAll over the world cats are often linked to magical practices, and the goddess Freyja, who was the first divinity reported to have practiced magic, was associated with cats [134] Cats and catskins appear to have been important symbols for the seeresses In Eiríks saga rauða, the account of Þorbjörg lítilvölva tells that her ritual dress had a black lambskin hood that was lined with white catskin and on her hands she wore catskin gloves [135] [136] [137] Ellis Davidson argues that the catskin represents the seeresses' helping animal spirits (see the section on magical projection, above), [138] and Price connects these cat spirits with the cats that pull Freyja's wagon [139]\n\n\nChristianity\nThe seeresses rarely appear in the earliest Scandinavian written sources, such as runestones and skaldic poetry, and they do not appear in place names which suggests a marginal position in society; older research has cast them in a negative light [144] Simek comments that all our sources on Germanic seeresses have passed through the filter of Roman and Christian interpretations The Romans interpreted them as similar to their augurs, while the Christian writers considered them to be \"more or less witches\" [130] In sources from the Christian era, their rituals are described as suspicious and sometimes evil This attitude can even be seen in some Eddic lays, and in the Ynglinga saga, Snorri Sturluson writes that their practice was so evil that \"manly men considered it too shameful to practise it, and so it was taught to priestesses\" [145] It is possible that the Christian scribes wanted to minimize and deprecate them and their rites and turn them into an oddity [144] Price comments that the associations with Freyja and the Vanir gods lingered for a long time in Christian medieval Scandinavia, but the Viking Age views were replaced by negative views influenced by Christian attitudes towards female sexuality as something dangerous that had to be contained This was related to the same fears that later led to witchcraft hysteria, manifested as what Ellis Davidson referred to as \"the sinister light which played round  [Freyja's] cult for the story-tellers of a Christian age\" [146] [139]\n\n\nLate Middle Ages\nThe seeress tradition did not disappear, at least not during the Middle Ages Mitchell writes in his book Witchcraft and Magic in the Nordic Middle Ages (2011) that not even the most triumphalist Christian, nor even the most sceptic scholar, can deny the continued survival of the practices of these women However, it is also clear that during centuries of transmission, their practices changed through external influences, and evolved [148] Attitudes also changed and sorcery was increasingly considered to be witchcraft during the Middle Ages, and by the 15th century society appears no longer to have distinguished between sorcesses and healers such as midwives and wise women The witch was inherently evil, she could fly to the sabbath and have intercourse with the devil, and she ate infants [149]\n\n\nWitch-hunts\nThe Malleus Maleficarum extended the concept of \"witch\" to more women, and concepts that used to be separate – folklore and witchcraft - merged with the concept of heresy Morris argues that without this book there would probably never have been witch-hunts, and that the printing press helped spread the notion of diabolical witchcraft from the ecclesiastical elite to a larger part of the population This was also the time of the revival of \"high magic\" during the renaissance, but the Church did not separate the two and persecuted both the \"low magic\" and \"high magic\" as heresy About eighty per cent of those accused of witchcraft were women, and the accusations included Devil worship, having sex with the Devil, sex both oral and anal, incest and cannibalism of infants Morris comments that the accusations reveal more about the inquisitors than about the women who were accused The accusations were characterized by ecclesiastical attitudes towards female sexuality, and it is notable that the practices they were accused of were preventive to procreation Morris argues that the evolution from Germanic pagan seeresses to witches during the witch-hunts is a case study in how attitudes towards magic were affected by the change of religion [149]\n\n\nModern influence\nThe concept of the Germanic seeress has had influence in a variety of areas of popular culture For example, in 1965, the Icelandic scholar Sigurður Nordal coined the Icelandic language term for computer—tölva— by blending the words tala (number) and völva [150]\n\n\nSee also\n Media related to Seeress (Germanic) at Wikimedia Commons\n\n\nReferences\n Media related

society, known for their ability to communicate with the spirits and predict the future. The term \"seeress\" encompasses a range of roles and practices, from divination and prophecy to magic and spiritualism. In this article, we will explore the history and significance of the seeress in Germanic culture, as well as their practices and attributes.\n\n# Names and Terminology\n\nThe names and terminology used to describe the seeresses of ancient Germanic society are diverse and complex. In Old English, the term \"hellerune\" referred to a seeress or witch, while in Old High German, \"hellirûna\" was used to describe necromancy and \"hellirunari\" to describe a necromancer. The Proto-Germanic form *χalja-rūnō(n) has been reconstructed, with *χaljō referring to Hel, the abode of the dead, and *rūnō meaning \"mystery\" or \"secret\". This form is also the source of the Finnish word \"runo\", which means \"poem\".\n\n# The Term Shamanism\n\nThere has long been an academic debate on whether the seeresses' practice should be regarded as shamanism. However, this debate pertains to the concept of shamanism in a restricted sense, rather than the broader definition. The majority of scholars support the \"shamanic interpretation, and the presence of ecstatic rituals\", while a minority is skeptical. Clive Tolley, who is among the sceptics, writes that if shamanism is defined as \"tundra shamanism\" as represented by the Sámi of Scandinavia and as defined by Edward Vajda, then the differences are too great. However, if shamanism is defined in line with the words of Åke Hultkrantz, then it is correct to define their practices as \"broadly shamanic\".\n\n# Role in Society\n\nFate is central in Germanic literature and mythology, and men's destiny is inextricably linked to supernatural women and seeresses. The seeresses were feared and revered by gods and mortals alike, and even the god Odin consulted them. The Norns, who were associated with fate, were embodied by the seeresses. The seeresses played a crucial role in Germanic society, serving as intermediaries between the human and spiritual worlds.\n\n# Attestations\n\nGermanic seeresses are first described by the Romans, who discuss the role seeresses played in Germanic society. Ganna, a seeress, was taken to Rome by the Roman emperor Domitian, where she was treated with honors. The Origo Gentis Langobardorum and the Historia Langobardorum contain legends about the Langobard people, who were led by the brothers Ibor and Agio. Their mother, Gambara, advised them not to pay tribute to the Vandals, and she invoked Odin's wife Frigg instead. Frigg advised them to trick Odin by having the Winnili women spread their hair in front of their faces, thus naming them the \"long-beards\".\n\n# Roman Era\n\nIn the Roman era, the Germanic word for chanting was similar to the reconstructed Proto-Germanic form *ʒalđran. The seeresses used chanting as a means of communicating with the spirits and predicting the future. They also used the term \"galdr\" to describe incantations and charms. The word \"galdr\" is derived from *ʒalanan, which became ON gala (\"to crow, sing\"), OHG galan (\"to incantate\"), and OE ʒalan (\"to sing\").\n\n# North Germanic Corpus\n\nThe North Germanic corpus contains numerous sources that mention seeresses among the North Germanic peoples. Olga of Kiev may have served as a Völva, and as a \"priestess of Freyja\", before converting to Christianity. She was described as the \"wisest of all women\" and her reputation as being wise goes back to her pre-conversion years. Her wisdom is also reported by Óláfs saga Tryggvassonar, where she is called Allogia and mistaken for Vladimir the Great's old mother. She is described as \"very wise\" and her main function at the court was as a prophetess, one whose predictions also came true.\n\n# Archaeological Record\n\nThe archaeological record for Viking Age society features a variety of graves that are identified as those of North Germanic seeresses. A notable example occurs at Fyrkat, in the northern Jutland region of Denmark. The grave of a woman buried within a horse-drawn carriage and wearing a red and blue dress embroidered with gold thread, all signs of high status. The grave contains items commonly found in female Viking Age graves, such as scissors and spindle whorls, as well as rare and exotic items, such as silver toe rings and bronze bowls originating from Central Asia.\n\n# Activities\n\nIn Scandinavian sources, seeresses work as diviners using a practice called seiðr on a ritual platform called seiðhjallr.

The original meaning of \"gandr\" appears to be \"something which is connected with the soul of the magician and can be sent out from him or her in sleep or ecstasy\".\n\n# Prophesying\n\nThe seeresses conveyed the acquired information to the audience in two ways.

Attitudes also changed and sorcery was increasingly considered to be witchcraft during the Middle Ages.\n\n# Modern Influence\n\nThe concept of the Germanic seeress has had influence in a variety of areas of popular culture. For example, in 1965, the Icelandic scholar Sigurður Nordal coined the Icelandic language term for computer—tölva—by blending the words tala (number) and völva.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Seeress_(Germanic)\" following this outline:\n\n\nNames and terminology\nAside from the names of individuals, Roman era accounts do not contain information about how the early Germanic peoples referred to them, but sixth century Goth scholar Jordanes reported in his Getica that the early Goths had called their seeresses haliurunnae (Goth-Latin) [2] The word also appears in Old English (OE), hellerune (\"seeress\" or \"witch\") and in Old High German (OHG) as hellirûna (\"necromancy\") and hellirunari (\"necromancer\"), [3] [4] and from these forms an earlier Proto-Germanic form *χalja-rūnō(n) has been reconstructed, [5] in which the first element is *χaljō, i.e Hel, the abode of the dead, [6] and the second is *rūnō (\"mystery, secret\") [7] At this time the word *rūnō still referred to chanting and not to letters (rune), [4] and in the sense \"incantation\" it was probably borrowed from Proto-Germanic into Finnish where runo means \"poem\" [8]\n\n\nThe term shamanism\nThere has long been an academic debate on whether the seeresses' practice should be regarded as shamanism However, this does not pertain to the concept of shamanism in a wider definition (see e.g the definitions of the OED), but rather to what degree similarities can be found between what is preserved about them in Old Norse literature and the shamanism of northern Eurasia in a more restricted sense The majority of scholars support the \"shamanic interpretation, and the presence of ecstatic rituals\" (e.g Ellis Davidson, Ohlmarks, Pálsson, Meulengracht Sørensen, Turville-Petre and de Vries), while a minority is skeptical (e.g Bugge, Dillmann, Dumézil, Näsström and Schjødt), but there are divergent opinions within the two camps [25] Clive Tolley, who is among the sceptics, writes that if shamanism is defined as \"tundra shamanism\" as represented by the Sámi of Scandinavia and as defined by Edward Vajda, then the differences are too great He allies himself with the position of Ohlmarks, who was familiar with a wide range shamanism and rejected it in 1939, in a debate with Dag Strömbäck who found similarities with Sámi practices However, Tolley concedes that if shamanism is defined in line with the words of Åke Hultkrantz (1993) as \" [...] direct contact with spiritual beings and guardian spirits, together with the mediating role played by a shaman in a ritual setting  [...] The presence of guardian spirits during the trance and following shamanic actions  [...]\" then it is correct to define their practices as \"broadly shamanic\" However, he considers that in this case shamanism also includes traditional practices from a large part of Europe, such as the witchcraft of medieval Europe and the practices of ancient Greece [26] An opposing view is held by Neil Price, who has studied circumpolar shamanism, and argues that he finds enough similarities to define the North Germanic seeresses as shamans also in the stricter sense [27]\n\n\nRole in society\nFate is central in Germanic literature and mythology, and men's destiny is inextricably linked to supernatural women and seeresses Morris comments that the importance of fate can not be overstressed, and the seeresses were feared and revered by gods and mortals alike Even the god Odin himself consulted them The Norns are an example of the link between women and fate, which was elevated in Germanic society, and the association was incarnated by the seeresses [28]\n\n\nAttestations\nGermanic seeresses are first described by the Romans, who discuss the role seeresses played in Germanic society A gap in the historical record occurs until the North Germanic record began over a millennium later, when the Old Norse sagas frequently mention seeresses among the North Germanic peoples It is noteworthy that Veleda, who prophesied in a high tower in the first century, finds an echo in the thirteenth-century account of Þorbjörg lítilvölva who prophesied from a raised platform in Eiríks saga rauða [38] Simek comments that the saga's account of Þorbjörg's raised platform and her wand conveys authentic practices from Germanic paganism [39]\n\n\nRoman Era\nIn his ethnography of the ancient Germanic peoples, Germania, Tacitus expounds on some of these points In chapter eight, he reports the following about women in then-contemporary Germanic society and the role of seeresses:\n\n\nAlbruna\nIn the first and second centuries CE, Greek and Roman authors—such as Greek historian Strabo, Roman senator Tacitus, and Roman historian Cassius Dio—wrote about the ancient Germanic peoples, and made note of the role of seeresses in Germanic society Tacitus mentions Germanic seeresses in book 4 of his first century CE Histories.\n\n\nVeleda\nIn the first and second centuries CE, Greek and Roman authors—such as Greek historian Strabo, Roman senator Tacitus, and Roman historian Cassius Dio—wrote about the ancient Germanic peoples, and made note of the role of seeresses in Germanic society Tacitus mentions Germanic seeresses in book 4 of his first century CE Histories.\n\n\nGanna\nA seeress named Ganna is mentioned by the Roman historiographer Cassius Dio in the early 3rd century The context is the campaign east of the Rhine by Emperor Domitian in the 80s of the 1st century CE Ganna belonged to a tribe called the Semnones who were settled east of the river Elbe, and she appears to have been active in the second half of the 1st century, after Veleda's time [30] Ganna's political influence was considerable enough that she was taken to Rome together with Masyos, the king of her tribe, where they had an audience with the Roman emperor and were treated with honours, after which they returned home [30] [31] This probably happened in 86 AD, the year after his final war with the Chatti, when he made a treaty with the Cherusci, who were settled between the rivers Weser and the Elbe [30]\n\n\nWaluburg\nDating from the second century CE, an ostracon with a Greek inscription reading Waluburg Se [m]noni Sibylla (Greek 'Waluburg, sibyl from the Semnones') was discovered in the early twentieth century on Elephantine, an Egyptian island The name occurs among a list of Roman and Graeco-Egyptian soldier names, perhaps indicating its use as a payroll [50]\n\n\nEarly Middle Ages\nThe Origo Gentis Langobardorum (Origin of the Lombard/Langobard people), a seventh-century Latin account, and the Historia Langobardorum (History of the Lombard/Langobards), from the 8th c., relate the legend that before, or after, the Langobard people, then known as the Winnili, emigrated from Scandinavia, led by the brothers Ibor and Agio, their neighbours, the Vandals, demanded that they pay tribute, but their mother Gambara advised them not to Before the battle, the Vandals called on Odin (Godan [58]) to give them victory, but Gambara invoked Odin's wife Frigg (Frea) instead [59] Frigg advised them to trick Odin, by having the Winnili women spread their hair in front of their faces so as to look bearded and stand before the window from which Odin looked down on Earth [60] Odin was embarrassed and asked who the \"long-beards\" (longobarbae [58]) were, and thus naming them he became their godfather and had to grant them victory [61]\n\n\nGambara\nThe Origo Gentis Langobardorum (Origin of the Lombard/Langobard people), a seventh-century Latin account, and the Historia Langobardorum (History of the Lombard/Langobards), from the 8th c., relate the legend that before, or after, the Langobard people, then known as the Winnili, emigrated from Scandinavia, led by the brothers Ibor and Agio, their neighbours, the Vandals, demanded that they pay tribute, but their mother Gambara advised them not to Before the

were, and thus naming them he became their godfather and had to grant them victory [61]\n\n\nHaliurunas\nGetica, a 6th century work on the history of the Goths, reports that the early Goths had called their seeresses haliurunas (or haliurunnae, etc.) (Goth-Latin) [2] They were in the words of Wolfram \"women who engaged in magic with the world of the dead\", and they were banished from their tribe by Filimer who was the last pre-Amal dynasty king of the migrating Goths [75] They found refuge in the wilderness where they were impregnated by unclean spirits from the Steppe, and engendered the Huns, which Pohl compares with the origin of the Sarmatians as presented by Herodotus [76] The account serves as an explanation for the origins of the Huns [77]\n\n\nNorth Germanic corpus\nFew records of myths among the Germanic peoples survive to modern times The North Germanic record is an exception, containing the vast majority of material that survives about the mythology of the Germanic peoples These sources mention numerous seeresses among the North Germanic peoples, including the following:\n\n\nOlga of Kiev\nThere are indications that Olga of Kiev may have served as a Völva, and as a \"priestess of Freyja\", before converting to Christianity [73] In the Primary Chronicle, she is described by the noblemen as the \"wisest of all women\", where wise has several meanings and her reputation as being wise goes back to her pre-conversion years [85] Her wisdom is also reported by Óláfs saga Tryggvassonar, where she is called Allogia and mistaken for Vladimir the Great's old mother, although she was his grand-mother There she is described as \"very wise\" and her main function at the court was as a prophetess, one whose predictions also came true When the king of Kievan Rus' celebrated Yule, he asked her to predict the future and to do so she was carried to him on a chair which recalls the elevated platforms of the seeresses Although he may not have transmitted a historical event, Oddr Snorrason, who wrote the saga in the 12th c., clearly identified Olga as a völva [86]\n\n\nArchaeological Record\nThe archaeological record for Viking Age society features a variety of graves that are identified as those of North Germanic seeresses A notable example occurs at Fyrkat, in the northern Jutland region of Denmark Fyrkat is the site of a former Viking Age ring fortress; the cemetery section of the site contains, among about 30 others, the grave of a woman buried within a horse-drawn carriage and wearing a red and blue dress embroidered with gold thread, all signs of high status While the grave contains items commonly found in female Viking Age graves such as scissors and spindle whorls, it also contains a variety of other rare and exotic items For example, the woman wore silver toe rings (otherwise unknown in the Scandinavian record) and her burial contained two bronze bowls originating from Central Asia [100]\n\n\nActivities\nIn Scandinavian sources, seeresses work as diviners using a practice called seiðr on a ritual platform called seiðhjallr (see below), which is associated with shamanism They also take part in other activities, but they do not appear to perform sacrifices They are described as ritual specialists travelling from settlement to settlement, sometimes with a group of followers, and late sources tell that they received payment for their services [102]\n\n\nChanting\nIn the Roman era, the Germanic word for chanting was similar to the reconstructed Proto-Germanic form *ʒalđran, which later evolved into Old Norse galdr (\"song, charm; witchcraft, sorcery\"), OHG galtar (\"incantation, charm\") and Old English ʒealdor with the same meaning, [103] also rendered as galdor (\"sound, song, incantation, spell, enchantment\") [104] It is derived from *ʒalanan, which became ON gala (\"to crow, sing\"), OHG galan (\"to incantate\") and OE ʒalan (\"to sing\") [105] It is related to the English nightingale and yell, to Latin gallus (\"cock\") and it appears in ON gylfra (\"witch\") [104] The many uses of chanting are revealed in the words that are derived from galdr, such as galdrabók (\"book of magic\"), galdrasmiðja (\"objects used for magic\"), galdravél (\"a magic device\"), galdrahríð (\"magic storm\"), galdrastafir (\"magical characters\") and valgaldr (a kind of Odinic necromancy) [106] The modern Swedish word galen (\"crazy\", literally \"having been chanted\") is derived from the word for this practice [107]\n\n\nSummoning\nWhile the varðlok(k)ur (mentioned above) attracted protective spirits that provided information to the enchantress, there were animal spirits that were sent out to collect information for her, and to perform other tasks [115] Consequently, the task of the sorceress was to control spirits, [116] and the name that appears to have been used for these spirits and for several other aspects in sorcery is gandr (pl gandir); the relationship between the extended meanings of gandr is complex and a matter of discussion among scholars [117] [118] The original meaning appears to be \"something which is connected with the soul of the magician and can be sent out from him or her in sleep or ecstasy\" [118]\n\n\nProphesying\nThere are two ways in which the seeress conveys the acquired information to the audience One of them is by having a seizure during the trance and gasping for air with a wide open mouth (Hrólfs saga kraka and Hauks þáttr hábrókar) She delivers her prophesy during the trance, and it may be said that a song appears from elsewhere in her mouth (Ǫrvar-Odds saga and Hrólfs saga kraka) [127] In Hrólfs saga kraka, it is in the beginning of the trance that she breathes in, and Tolley considers that this may represent a breathing in of spirits rather than her letting out her soul [128] Price comments that as far as textual criticism is concerned, this detail can not have been borrowed from those of the neighbouring Fenno-Ugric peoples, because the closest practitioners are the Yukaghir people on the other side of Eurasia, whose practices were inaccessible for the saga writers [129]\n\n\nAttributes\nThere appears to be a continuity between elements such as the first century Bructerian seeress Veleda's tower and the seiðhjallr that played an important role in Scandinavian sources [130] The word seiðhjallr means \"incantation scaffold\", for performing magic [104]\n\n\nWands\nThere appears to be a continuity between elements such as the first century Bructerian seeress Veleda's tower and the seiðhjallr that played an important role in Scandinavian sources [130] The word seiðhjallr means \"incantation scaffold\", for performing magic [104]\n\n\nPlatforms\nThere appears to be a continuity between elements such as the first century Bructerian seeress Veleda's tower and the seiðhjallr that played an important role in Scandinavian sources [130] The word seiðhjallr means \"incantation scaffold\", for performing magic [104]\n\n\nHallucinogens\nThe notion of ecstatic experience induced or complemented by the use of intoxicants in the context of Nordic pagan religion is not new, and there have been several attempts to reconstruct such practices Little evidence to confirm the Viking Age ingestion of hallucinogens such as psilocybin mushrooms or other entheogens has been found, with the exception of two archaeological finds: [131]\n\n\nCats\nAll over the world cats are often linked to magical practices, and the goddess Freyja, who was the first divinity reported to have practiced magic, was associated with cats [134] Cats and catskins appear to have been important symbols for the seeresses In Eiríks saga rauða, the account of Þorbjörg lítilvölva tells that her ritual dress had a black lambskin hood that was lined with white catskin and on her hands she wore catskin gloves [135] [136] [137] Ellis Davidson argues that the catskin represents the seeresses' helping animal spirits (see the section on magical projection, above), [138] and Price connects these cat spirits with the cats that pull Freyja's wagon [139]\n\n\nChristianity\nThe seeresses rarely appear in the earliest Scandinavian written sources, such as runestones and skaldic poetry, and they do not appear in place names which suggests a marginal position in society; older research has cast them in a negative light [144] Simek comments that all our sources on Germanic seeresses have passed through the filter of Roman and Christian interpretations The Romans interpreted them as similar to their augurs, while the Christian writers considered them to be \"more or less witches\" [130] In sources from the Christian era, their rituals are described as suspicious and sometimes evil This attitude can even be seen in some Eddic lays, and in the Ynglinga saga, Snorri Sturluson writes that their practice was so evil that \"manly men considered it too shameful to practise it, and so it was taught to priestesses\" [145] It is possible that the Christian scribes wanted to minimize and deprecate them and their rites and turn them into an oddity [144] Price comments that the associations with Freyja and the Vanir gods lingered for a long time in Christian medieval Scandinavia, but the Viking Age views were replaced by negative views influenced by Christian attitudes towards female sexuality as something dangerous that had to be contained This was related to the same fears that later led to witchcraft hysteria, manifested as what Ellis Davidson referred to as \"the sinister light which played round  [Freyja's] cult for the story-tellers of a Christian age\" [146] [139]\n\n\nLate Middle Ages\nThe seeress tradition did not disappear, at least not during the Middle Ages Mitchell writes in his book Witchcraft and Magic in the Nordic Middle Ages (2011) that not even the most triumphalist Christian, nor even the most sceptic scholar, can deny the continued survival of the practices of these women However, it is also clear that during centuries of transmission, their practices changed through external influences, and evolved [148] Attitudes also changed and sorcery was increasingly considered to be witchcraft during the Middle Ages, and by the 15th century society appears no longer to have distinguished between sorcesses and healers such as midwives and wise women The witch was inherently evil, she could fly to the sabbath and have intercourse with the devil, and she ate infants [149]\n\n\nWitch-hunts\nThe Malleus Maleficarum extended the concept of \"witch\" to more women, and concepts that used to be separate – folklore and witchcraft - merged with the concept of heresy Morris argues that without this book there would probably never have been witch-hunts, and that the printing press helped spread the notion of diabolical witchcraft from the ecclesiastical elite to a larger part of the population This was also the time of the revival of \"high magic\" during the renaissance, but the Church did not separate the two and persecuted both the \"low magic\" and \"high magic\" as heresy About eighty per cent of those accused of witchcraft were women, and the accusations included Devil worship, having sex with the Devil, sex both oral and anal, incest and cannibalism of infants Morris comments that the accusations reveal more about the inquisitors than about the women who were accused The accusations were characterized by ecclesiastical attitudes towards female sexuality, and it is notable that the practices they were accused of were preventive to procreation Morris argues that the evolution from Germanic pagan seeresses to witches during the witch-hunts is a case study in how attitudes towards magic were affected by the change of religion [149]\n\n\nModern influence\nThe concept of the Germanic seeress has had influence in a variety of areas of popular culture For example, in 1965, the Icelandic scholar Sigurður Nordal coined the Icelandic language term for computer—tölva— by blending the words tala (number) and völva [150]\n\n\nSee also\n Media related to Seeress (Germanic) at Wikimedia Commons\n\n\nReferences\n Media related

{"title": "Michael_Schumacher", "content": "\nEarly years\nMichael Schumacher was born in the West German town of Hürth, North Rhine-Westphalia, on 3 January 1969, to working-class parents Rolf—a bricklayer who later ran the local kart track—and Elisabeth Schumacher (1948–2003), who operated the track's canteen [1] When Schumacher was four, his father modified his pedal kart by adding a small motorcycle engine After he crashed it into a lamp post in Kerpen, his parents took him to the karting track at Kerpen-Horrem, where he became the youngest member of the karting club His father built him a kart from discarded parts; at the age of six, Schumacher won his first club championship To support his racing, Schumacher's father took on a second job renting and repairing karts, while his mother worked at the track's canteen Nevertheless, when Schumacher needed a new engine costing 800 DM, his parents were unable to afford it; he was able to continue racing with support from local businessmen [2]\n\n\nFormula One career\n\"No one will ever be greater than Schumi Michael has shaped a generation like no other, he is iconic.\"\n\n\nProfile\n\"No one will ever be greater than Schumi Michael has shaped a generation like no other, he is iconic.\"\n\n\nJordan (1991)\nSchumacher made his Formula One debut with the Irish Jordan-Ford team at the Belgian Grand Prix, driving car number 32 as a replacement for the imprisoned Bertrand Gachot [36] Schumacher, still a contracted Mercedes driver, was signed by Eddie Jordan after Mercedes paid Jordan $150,000 for his debut [37]\n\n\nBenetton (1991–1995)\nFollowing his Belgian Grand Prix debut, despite an agreement in principle between Jordan and Schumacher's Mercedes management that would see the German race for the Irish team for the remainder of the season, Schumacher was engaged by Benetton-Ford for the next race Jordan applied for an injunction in the British courts to prevent Schumacher driving for Benetton but lost the case as they had not yet signed a final contract [42]\n\n\n1991–1993: first points, podiums, and wins\nSchumacher finished the 1991 season with four points out of six races His best finish was fifth in his second race, the Italian Grand Prix, in which he finished ahead of his teammate and three-time World Champion Nelson Piquet [43] [44] He also outqualified Piquet four times out of five in the season run-in, and scored only half a point less than him in the time they were together [33]\n\n\n1994–1995: back-to-back World Championship years\nSchumacher won his first Drivers' Championship in 1994 Driving the Benetton B194, which has been called the worst car to have won a Formula One World Championship and was difficult to drive, [55] so much so that Schumacher had three different teammates (JJ Lehto, Jos Verstappen, and Johnny Herbert) due to crashes, Schumacher won the first four races and finished the season with eight wins [56] He won six of the first seven races, including the Brazilian Grand Prix in which he lapped the entire field, [12] and was leading the Spanish Grand Prix, before a gearbox failure left him stuck in fifth gear for most of the race [33] Schumacher made two pit stops without stalling and finished the race in second place Benetton boss Flavio Briatore stated that Schumacher's drive was one of the best he had ever seen [57] [58]\n\n\nFerrari (1996–2006)\nIn 1996, Schumacher joined Ferrari, a team that had last won the Drivers' Championship in 1979 and the Constructors' Championship in 1983, for a salary of $60 million over two years He left Benetton a year before his contract with them expired; he later cited the team's damaging actions in 1994 as his reason for opting out of his deal [78] A year later, Schumacher lured Benetton employees Rory Byrne (designer) and Ross Brawn (technical director) to Ferrari [79] Ferrari had previously come close to the championship in 1982 and 1990 The team had suffered a disastrous downturn in the early 1990s, partially as its famous V12 engine was no longer competitive against the smaller, lighter, and more fuel-efficient V10s of its competitors Various drivers, notably Alain Prost, had given the vehicles disparaging labels, such as \"truck\", \"pig\", and \"accident waiting to happen\" [80] Furthermore, the poor performance of the Ferrari pit crews was considered a running joke [24] At the end of 1995, although the team had improved into a solid competitor, it was still considered inferior to front-running teams like Benetton and Williams [81] Schumacher declared the Ferrari F310 good enough to win a championship, [82] although afterwards his teammate Eddie Irvine labelled the F310 \"an awful car\", a \"piece of junk\", and \"almost undriveable\", while designer John Barnard admitted that the car \"wasn't very good\" [83] Irvine also later commented: \"The '96  [Ferrari] car was a disaster and was nearly undriveable Only someone of Michael Schumacher's ability − and maybe Senna – could have driven it.\" [33]\n\n\n1996–1999: World Championship challenges\n\"It was not a race It was a demonstration of brilliance.\"\n\n\n2000–2004: five consecutive World Championships\nin 2000, Schumacher won his third Drivers' Championship, his first with Ferrari, after a year-long battle with Häkkinen Schumacher won the first three races of the season and five of the first eight Midway through the year, Schumacher's chances suffered with three consecutive non-finishes, allowing Häkkinen to close the gap in the standings [142] At the German Grand Prix qualifying session, which was largely decided in the opening 10 minutes of semi-dry weather, Schumacher was able to improve his time in the final seconds and qualified second In the race, he retired after crashing out at the start, as his new teammate Rubens Barrichello took his maiden win from 18th [33] Häkkinen then took another two victories, before Schumacher won at the Italian Grand Prix, his 41st career win [33] At the post-race press conference, after equalling the number of wins won by his idol Ayrton Senna, Schumacher broke into tears [143] The championship fight came down to the penultimate race of the season, the Japanese Grand Prix Starting from pole position, Schumacher lost the lead to Häkkinen at the start [33] After his second pit stop, Schumacher came out ahead of Häkkinen and went on to win the race and the Drivers' Championship; [144] [145] he later described it as the fight of his life [146] Although Schumacher won more than twice as many Grands Prix as Häkkinen, BBC Sport journalist Andrew Benson stated that \"the challenge from Mika Hakkinen and McLaren-Mercedes was far stronger than the raw statistics suggest\" and that the Adrian Newey-designed McLaren was \"the fastest car in F1 for the third straight year\" Benson also hailed Schumacher as \"unquestionably the greatest driver of his era\" [147]\n\n\n2005–2006: rule changes and first retirement\nRule changes for the 2005 season required tyres to last an entire race, [199] tipping the overall advantage to teams using Michelins over teams like Ferrari that relied on Bridgestone tyres [200] The rule changes were partly in an effort to dent Ferrari's dominance and make the series more interesting [24] The most notable moment of the early season for Schumacher was his battle with Renault R25 driver Fernando Alonso at the San Marino Grand Prix, where he started 13th and finished only 0.2 seconds behind Alonso [201] [202] [203] Less than halfway through the season, Schumacher stated: \"I don't think I can count myself in this battle any more It was like trying to fight with a blunted weapon If your weapons are weak you don't have a chance.\" [204] Schumacher's sole win in 2005 came at the United States Grand Prix in a 1–2 finish with Rubens Barrichello [205] Before that race, the Michelin tyres were found to have significant safety issues When no compromise between the teams and the FIA could be reached, all but the three teams using Bridgestone tyres dropped out of the race after the formation lap, leaving only six drivers on the grid [206] [207] [208] Schumacher retired in 6 of the 19 races, and finished the season in third with 62 points, fewer than half the points of World Champion Alonso [209]\n\n\n2007–2009: new roles at Ferrari, motorcycle racing, and injury\nDuring the 2007 season, Schumacher acted as Ferrari's adviser and Jean Todt's super assistant [247] Schumacher also helped Ferrari with their development programme at the Jerez circuit He focused on testing electronics and tyres for the 2008 season [248] During 2008, Schumacher also competed in motorcycle racing in the IDM Superbike series At a Superbike cup race at the Pannónia-Ring, Schumacher finished third out of twenty-seven—behind professional motorcycle racers Martin Bauer and Andreas Meklau—riding a Honda CBR1000RR [249]\n\n\nMercedes (2010–2012)\n\"He played a crucial role when we re-joined F1 and was one of the people who laid the foundation for our future success We're extremely grateful for everything he did for us.\"\n\n\n2010: return from retirement\nAfter having impressed in the free practices, Schumacher finished sixth in the first race of the season at the Bahrain Grand Prix, [270] 1,239 days after his previous Formula One race [271] He finished behind teammate Nico Rosberg in each of the first four qualifying sessions and races; former driver Stirling Moss suggested that Schumacher might be \"past it\" [272] Several other former Formula One drivers thought otherwise, including former rival Damon Hill, who warned \"you should never write Schumacher off\" [273] GrandPrix.com identified the inherent understeer of the Mercedes car, exacerbated by the narrower front tyres introduced for the 2010 season, as contributing to Schumacher's difficulties [274] Jenson Button would later claim that Mercedes's car was designed for him, as he would initially drive for the team, and that their differing driving styles may have contributed to Schumacher's difficulties [275]\n\n\n2011–2012: final podium and second retirement\nAfter starting the 2011 season with a retirement, [295] [296] Schumacher's first points were scored at the Malaysian Grand Prix where he finished ninth; [297] Schumacher later came sixth in Spain, [298] and he took fourth place at the Canadian Grand Prix, [299] [300] [301] after running as high as second in a wet race; [302] his Canadian race was seen at the time as his most convincing performance since he came out of retirement [303] Despite starting last at the Belgian Grand Prix, [304] twenty years after his debut, [305] [306] Schumacher finished fifth [307] The Japanese Grand Prix saw Schumacher lead three laps during the race, marking the first time he had led a race since 2006 [308] In doing so, he became the oldest driver to lead a race since Jack Brabham in 1970 [309] Schumacher finished the season in eighth place in the Drivers' Championship, with 76 points [310] [311] [312]\n\n\nHelmet\nSchumacher, in conjunction with Schuberth, helped develop the first lightweight carbon fibre reinforced polymer helmet In 2004, a prototype was publicly tested by being driven over by a tank; it survived intact [341] The helmet kept the driver cool by funneling directed airflow through fifty holes [342] Schumacher's original helmet sported the colours of the German flag and his sponsor's decals On the top was a blue circle with white astroids [343] From the 2000 Monaco Grand Prix, in order to differentiate his colours from his new teammate Rubens Barrichello—whose helmet was predominantly white with a blue circle on top and a red ellipsis surrounding the visor—Schumacher changed the upper blue colour and some of the white areas to red [344] For the 2006 Brazilian Grand Prix, he wore an all-red helmet that included the names of his ninety-one Grand Prix victories [345] At the 2011 Belgian Grand Prix, Schumacher's 20th anniversary in Formula One, he wore a commemorative gold-leafed helmet, which included the year of his debut and the seasons of his seven Drivers' titles [346] During his 300th Grand Prix appearance at the 2012 Belgian Grand Prix, Schumacher wore a platinum-leafed helmet with a message of his achievement [347]\n\n\nLegacy\nSchumacher's career spanned three decades, or twenty-three years, and left a lasting impact on the sport, Formula One in particular but also motorsport as a whole, and his influence extended beyond his own racing career By the time of his first retirement in 2006 and his final retirement in 2012, Schumacher was widely considered among the greatest Formula One drivers, [348] [349] [309] a trend that continued into the 2020s [350] [351] [352] Several commentators and drivers, including among others multi-time World Champions Niki Lauda and Sebastian Vettel, [34] [353] former rival David Coulthard, [354] former Formula One driver Giancarlo Fisichella, [355] and Mercedes team bosses Ross Brawn and Toto Wolff, [356] [357] have at times described him as the greatest of his era and the greatest of all time [33] Schumacher was the sport's most dominant force in the 2000s, [358] being described as statistically the most successful driver in Formula One history and the most complete Formula One driver ever [10] By 2004, Schumacher came to hold most major Formula One records, and by 2006 his name was inscribed in almost all of Formula One's record books, including for most World Championships (7), most wins (91), most podiums (155), most pole positions (68), and most fastest laps (77), [197] the latter a record he still holds Although several of his records were later equalled or beaten, such as the most wins in a season at 13 (a record he first broke in 1995 and then equalled in 2000 and 2001, and further improved in 2002 and 2004), by multiple-time World Champions like Vettel, [359] [360] Lewis Hamilton, [361] [362] [363] and Max Verstappen, [364] others remain his, such as his 100 percent podium finish in 2002 (17), [365] [366] which included eleven wins, five second places, and one third place [367]\n\n\nHonours\nSchumacher has been honoured many times In 1992, the German Motor Sport Federation awarded him the ONS Cup, the highest accolade in German motorsport; he also won the trophy in 1994, 1995, and 2002 [385] In 1993, he won a Bambi Award (Sports) and was the first racing driver to receive the Golden Steering Wheel [386] [387] In 1994 and from 2001 to 2003, Schumacher was voted European Sportsperson of the Year by the International Sports Press Association [388] He was voted by Polish Press Agency the European Sportsperson of the Year from 2001 to 2003 [389] In 1995 and from 2000 to 2002, he was named Autosport International Racing Driver of the Year [390] [391] Schumacher was voted German Sportspersonality of the Year in 1995 and 2004 [392] During the latter year, he was voted Germany's greatest sportsperson of the 20th century, beating Birgit Fischer and Steffi Graf to the accolade [393] For his sports achievements and his commitment to road safety, Schumacher was awarded Germany's highest sporting accolade, the Silbernes Lorbeerblatt, in 1997 [394] In 2002, for his contributions to sport and his contributions in raising awareness of child education, Schumacher was named as one of the UNESCO Champions for Sport [395]\n\n\nPersonal life and philanthropy\nIn August 1995, Schumacher married Corinna Betsch [422] They have two children, a daughter Gina-Maria (born 20 February 1997) and a son, Mick (born 22 March 1999) Schumacher has always been very protective of his private life and is known to dislike the celebrity spotlight [422] From 1992 to May 1996, Schumacher resided in the Fontvieille district in Monaco The family moved to a newly built mansion near Gland, Switzerland, in 2007, covering an area of 650-square-metre (7,000 sq ft) with a private beach on Lake Geneva and featuring an underground garage and petrol station, with a vintage Shell fuel pump [423] Schumacher and his wife own horse ranches in Texas and Switzerland [424] Schumacher's younger brother Ralf, his son Mick, his nephew David and step-brother Sebastian Stahl have also been racing drivers [425] Ralf Schumacher competed in Formula One for ten years, starting from 1997 until the end of 2007 [1] Mick became the third Schumacher to race in Formula One, having made his debut with Haas F1 Team in the 2021 season [426]\n\n\nFinance and sponsorship\nIn 1999 and 2000, Forbes magazine listed him as the highest paid athlete in the world [449] In 2005, EuroBusiness magazine identified Schumacher as the world's first billionaire athlete [450] In 2005, Forbes ranked him 17th in its \"The World's Most Powerful Celebrities\" list [451] A significant share of his income came from advertising; Deutsche Vermögensberatung paid him $8 million over three years from 1999 for wearing a 10 by 8 centimetre advertisement on his post-race cap [452] In 2010, his personal fortune was estimated at £515 million [453] In 2017, Forbes designated Schumacher as the athlete with the fifth highest career earnings of all-time [454]\n\n\n2013 skiing accident\nOn 29 December 2013, Schumacher was skiing with his then 14-year-old son Mick, descending the Combe de Saulire below the Dent de Burgin above Méribel in the French Alps An experienced skier, while crossing an unsecured off-piste area between Piste Chamois and Piste Mauduit, [455] [456] he fell and hit his head on a rock, sustaining a serious head injury despite wearing a ski helmet [457] [458] According to his physicians, he would most likely have died had he not been wearing a helmet [459] He was airlifted to Grenoble Hospital where he underwent two surgical interventions [460] Schumacher was put into a medically induced coma because of traumatic brain injury [461] [462] By March 2014, there were small encouraging signs In early April 2014, he was showing moments of consciousness as he was gradually withdrawn from the medically induced coma [463]\n\n\nKarting record\n(key) (Races in bold indicate pole position) (Races in italics indicate fastest lap)\n\n\nKarting career summary\n(key) (Races in bold indicate pole position) (Races in italics indicate fastest lap)\n\n\nRacing record\n(key) (Races in bold indicate pole position) (Races in italics indicate fastest lap)\n\n\nCareer summary\n(key) (Races in bold indicate pole position) (Races in italics indicate fastest lap)\n\n\nComplete German Formula Three results\n(key) (Races in bold indicate pole position) (Races in italics indicate fastest lap)\n\n\nComplete World Sportscar Championship results\n(key) (Races in bold indicate pole position;

Born on January 3, 1969, in Hürth, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, Schumacher began karting at a young age and quickly rose through the ranks to become a world champion in 1989. He made his Formula One debut in 1991 and went on to win seven World Drivers' Championships, a record he holds to this day. Schumacher's career was marked by his incredible speed, tactical genius, and unwavering dedication to the sport.\n\n**Early Years**\n\nMichael Schumacher was born to working-class parents, Rolf and Elisabeth Schumacher. His father, Rolf, was a bricklayer who later ran a local kart track, and his mother, Elisabeth, operated the track's canteen. Schumacher's passion for racing began at the age of four, when his father modified his pedal kart by adding a small motorcycle engine. After crashing it into a lamp post, Schumacher's parents took him to the karting track at Kerpen-Horrem, where he became the youngest member of the club. His father built him a kart from discarded parts, and at the age of six, Schumacher won his first club championship.\n\n**Formula One Career**\n\nSchumacher made his Formula One debut with the Irish Jordan-Ford team at the Belgian Grand Prix in 1991, driving car number 32 as a replacement for the imprisoned Bertrand Gachot. He later joined Benetton-Ford in 1991 and went on to win his first World Drivers' Championship in 1994, driving the Benetton B194. Schumacher's performance was impressive, considering the car was considered the worst to have won a World Championship.\n\nIn 1996, Schumacher joined Ferrari, a team that had last won the Drivers' Championship in 1979 and the Constructors' Championship in 1983. He left Benetton a year before his contract expired, citing the team's damaging actions in 1994 as his reason for opting out. Schumacher's move to Ferrari marked the beginning of a successful partnership that would yield seven World Drivers' Championships and five World Constructors' Championships.\n\n**1996-1999: World Championship Challenges**\n\nSchumacher's first season with Ferrari was marked by a series of close battles with his teammate, Eddie Irvine. Despite the team's struggles, Schumacher's consistency and speed earned him the Drivers' Championship in 1996. In 1997, Schumacher's Ferrari teammate, Jean Alesi, took several victories, but Schumacher's reliability and consistency secured his second consecutive Drivers' Championship.\n\n**2000-2004: Five Consecutive World Championships**\n\nSchumacher's dominance continued in the 2000s, with five consecutive World Drivers' Championships. He won his third Drivers' Championship in 2000, his fourth in 2001, his fifth in 2002, his sixth in 2003, and his seventh in 2004. Schumacher's performances were marred by controversy, particularly in 2002, when he was involved in a collision with his teammate, Rubens Barrichello, at the Austrian Grand Prix.\n\n**2005-2006: Rule Changes and First Retirement**\n\nThe 2005 season saw significant changes to the sport, with the introduction of new tires and aerodynamic regulations. Schumacher struggled to adapt to the new rules, and his Ferrari teammate, Felipe Massa, took several victories. Schumacher announced his retirement from Formula One after the 2006 season, citing his desire to spend more time with his family and focus on his personal life.\n\n**2007-2009: New Roles at Ferrari, Motorcycle Racing, and Injury**\n\nAfter his retirement, Schumacher took on a new role as Ferrari's adviser and Jean Todt's super assistant. He also helped Ferrari with their development program at the Jerez circuit, focusing on testing electronics and tires for the 2008 season. In 2008, Schumacher competed in motorcycle racing in the IDM Superbike series, finishing third in a Superbike cup race at the Pannónia-Ring.\n\nIn 2013, Schumacher suffered a serious head injury while skiing with his son, Mick, in the French Alps. He underwent two surgical interventions and was put into a medically induced coma due to traumatic brain injury.\n\n**2010-2012: Return from Retirement**\n\nSchumacher returned to Formula One in 2010, driving for Mercedes GP. He finished sixth in the first race of the season, 1,239 days after his previous Formula One race. Schumacher struggled to adapt to the new team and car, but his performances improved throughout the season. In 2011, Schumacher's first points were scored at the Malaysian Grand Prix, where he finished ninth. He took fourth place at the Canadian Grand Prix, running as high as second in a wet race.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nSchumacher's career was marked by his incredible speed, tactical genius, and unwavering dedication to the sport.

at the age of six, Schumacher won his first club championship To support his racing, Schumacher's father took on a second job renting and repairing karts, while his mother worked at the track's canteen Nevertheless, when Schumacher needed a new engine costing 800 DM, his parents were unable to afford it; he was able to continue racing with support from local businessmen [2]\n\n\nFormula One career\n\"No one will ever be greater than Schumi Michael has shaped a generation like no other, he is iconic.\"\n\n\nProfile\n\"No one will ever be greater than Schumi Michael has shaped a generation like no other, he is iconic.\"\n\n\nJordan (1991)\nSchumacher made his Formula One debut with the Irish Jordan-Ford team at the Belgian Grand Prix, driving car number 32 as a replacement for the imprisoned Bertrand Gachot [36] Schumacher, still a contracted Mercedes driver, was signed by Eddie Jordan after Mercedes paid Jordan $150,000 for his debut [37]\n\n\nBenetton (1991–1995)\nFollowing his Belgian Grand Prix debut, despite an agreement in principle between Jordan and Schumacher's Mercedes management that would see the German race for the Irish team for the remainder of the season, Schumacher was engaged by Benetton-Ford for the next race Jordan applied for an injunction in the British courts to prevent Schumacher driving for Benetton but lost the case as they had not yet signed a final contract [42]\n\n\n1991–1993: first points, podiums, and wins\nSchumacher finished the 1991 season with four points out of six races His best finish was fifth in his second race, the Italian Grand Prix, in which he finished ahead of his teammate and three-time World Champion Nelson Piquet [43] [44] He also outqualified Piquet four times out of five in the season run-in, and scored only half a point less than him in the time they were together [33]\n\n\n1994–1995: back-to-back World Championship years\nSchumacher won his first Drivers' Championship in 1994 Driving the Benetton B194, which has been called the worst car to have won a Formula One World Championship and was difficult to drive, [55] so much so that Schumacher had three different teammates (JJ Lehto, Jos Verstappen, and Johnny Herbert) due to crashes, Schumacher won the first four races and finished the season with eight wins [56] He won six of the first seven races, including the Brazilian Grand Prix in which he lapped the entire field, [12] and was leading the Spanish Grand Prix, before a gearbox failure left him stuck in fifth gear for most of the race [33] Schumacher made two pit stops without stalling and finished the race in second place Benetton boss Flavio Briatore stated that Schumacher's drive was one of the best he had ever seen [57] [58]\n\n\nFerrari (1996–2006)\nIn 1996, Schumacher joined Ferrari, a team that had last won the Drivers' Championship in 1979 and the Constructors' Championship in 1983, for a salary of $60 million over two years He left Benetton a year before his contract with them expired; he later cited the team's damaging actions in 1994 as his reason for opting out of his deal [78] A year later, Schumacher lured Benetton employees Rory Byrne (designer) and Ross Brawn (technical director) to Ferrari [79] Ferrari had previously come close to the championship in 1982 and 1990 The team had suffered a disastrous downturn in the early 1990s, partially as its famous V12 engine was no longer competitive against the smaller, lighter, and more fuel-efficient V10s of its competitors Various drivers, notably Alain Prost, had given the vehicles disparaging labels, such as \"truck\", \"pig\", and \"accident waiting to happen\" [80] Furthermore, the poor performance of the Ferrari pit crews was considered a running joke [24] At the end of 1995, although the team had improved into a solid competitor, it was still considered inferior to front-running teams like Benetton and Williams [81] Schumacher declared the Ferrari F310 good enough to win a championship, [82] although afterwards his teammate Eddie Irvine labelled the F310 \"an awful car\", a \"piece of junk\", and \"almost undriveable\", while designer John Barnard admitted that the car \"wasn't very good\" [83] Irvine also later commented: \"The '96  [Ferrari] car was a disaster and was nearly undriveable Only someone of Michael Schumacher's ability − and maybe Senna – could have driven it.\" [33]\n\n\n1996–1999: World Championship challenges\n\"It was not a race It was a demonstration of brilliance.\"\n\n\n2000–2004: five consecutive World Championships\nin 2000, Schumacher won his third Drivers' Championship, his first with Ferrari, after a year-long battle with Häkkinen Schumacher won the first three races of the season and five of the first eight Midway through the year, Schumacher's chances suffered with three consecutive non-finishes, allowing Häkkinen to close the gap in the standings [142] At the German Grand Prix qualifying session, which was largely decided in the opening 10 minutes of semi-dry weather, Schumacher was able to improve his time in the final seconds and qualified second In the race, he retired after crashing out at the start, as his new teammate Rubens Barrichello took his maiden win from 18th [33] Häkkinen then took another two victories, before Schumacher won at the Italian Grand Prix, his 41st career win [33] At the post-race press conference, after equalling the number of wins won by his idol Ayrton Senna, Schumacher broke into tears [143] The championship fight came down to the penultimate race of the season, the Japanese Grand Prix Starting from pole position, Schumacher lost the lead to Häkkinen at the start [33] After his second pit stop, Schumacher came out ahead of Häkkinen and went on to win the race and the Drivers' Championship; [144] [145] he later described it as the fight of his life [146] Although Schumacher won more than twice as many Grands Prix as Häkkinen, BBC Sport journalist Andrew Benson stated that \"the challenge from Mika Hakkinen and McLaren-Mercedes was far stronger than the raw statistics suggest\" and that the Adrian Newey-designed McLaren was \"the fastest car in F1 for the third straight year\" Benson also hailed Schumacher as \"unquestionably the greatest driver of his era\" [147]\n\n\n2005–2006: rule changes and first retirement\nRule changes for the 2005 season required tyres to last an entire race, [199] tipping the overall advantage to teams using Michelins over teams like Ferrari that relied on Bridgestone tyres [200] The rule changes were partly in an effort to dent Ferrari's dominance and make the series more interesting [24] The most notable moment of the early season for Schumacher was his battle with Renault R25 driver Fernando Alonso at the San Marino Grand Prix, where he started 13th and finished only 0.2 seconds behind Alonso [201] [202] [203] Less than halfway through the season, Schumacher stated: \"I don't think I can count myself in this battle any more It was like trying to fight with a blunted weapon If your weapons are weak you don't have a chance.\" [204] Schumacher's sole win in 2005 came at the United States Grand Prix in a 1–2 finish with Rubens Barrichello [205] Before that race, the Michelin tyres were found to have significant safety issues When no compromise between the teams and the FIA could be reached, all but the three teams using Bridgestone tyres dropped out of the race after the formation lap, leaving only six drivers on the grid [206] [207] [208] Schumacher retired in 6 of the 19 races, and finished the season in third with 62 points, fewer than half the points of World Champion Alonso [209]\n\n\n2007–2009: new roles at Ferrari, motorcycle racing, and injury\nDuring the 2007 season, Schumacher acted as Ferrari's adviser and Jean Todt's super assistant [247] Schumacher also helped Ferrari with their development programme at the Jerez circuit He focused on testing electronics and tyres for the 2008 season [248] During 2008, Schumacher also competed in motorcycle racing in the IDM Superbike series At a Superbike cup race at the Pannónia-Ring, Schumacher finished third out of twenty-seven—behind professional motorcycle racers Martin Bauer and Andreas Meklau—riding a Honda CBR1000RR [249]\n\n\nMercedes (2010–2012)\n\"He played a crucial role when we re-joined F1 and was one of the people who laid the foundation for our future success We're extremely grateful for everything he did for us.\"\n\n\n2010: return from retirement\nAfter having impressed in the free practices, Schumacher finished sixth in the first race of the season at the Bahrain Grand Prix, [270] 1,239 days after his previous Formula One race [271] He finished behind teammate Nico Rosberg in each of the first four qualifying sessions and races; former driver Stirling Moss suggested that Schumacher might be \"past it\" [272] Several other former Formula One drivers thought otherwise, including former rival Damon Hill, who warned \"you should never write Schumacher off\" [273] GrandPrix.com identified the inherent understeer of the Mercedes car, exacerbated by the narrower front tyres introduced for the 2010 season, as contributing to Schumacher's difficulties [274] Jenson Button would later claim that Mercedes's car was designed for him, as he would initially drive for the team, and that their differing driving styles may have contributed to Schumacher's difficulties [275]\n\n\n2011–2012: final podium and second retirement\nAfter starting the 2011 season with a retirement, [295] [296] Schumacher's first points were scored at the Malaysian Grand Prix where he finished ninth; [297] Schumacher later came sixth in Spain, [298] and he took fourth place at the Canadian Grand Prix, [299] [300] [301] after running as high as second in a wet race; [302] his Canadian race was seen at the time as his most convincing performance since he came out of retirement [303] Despite starting last at the Belgian Grand Prix, [304] twenty years after his debut, [305] [306] Schumacher finished fifth [307] The Japanese Grand Prix saw Schumacher lead three laps during the race, marking the first time he had led a race since 2006 [308] In doing so, he became the oldest driver to lead a race since Jack Brabham in 1970 [309] Schumacher finished the season in eighth place in the Drivers' Championship, with 76 points [310] [311] [312]\n\n\nHelmet\nSchumacher, in conjunction with Schuberth, helped develop the first lightweight carbon fibre reinforced polymer helmet In 2004, a prototype was publicly tested by being driven over by a tank; it survived intact [341] The helmet kept the driver cool by funneling directed airflow through fifty holes [342] Schumacher's original helmet sported the colours of the German flag and his sponsor's decals On the top was a blue circle with white astroids [343] From the 2000 Monaco Grand Prix, in order to differentiate his colours from his new teammate Rubens Barrichello—whose helmet was predominantly white with a blue circle on top and a red ellipsis surrounding the visor—Schumacher changed the upper blue colour and some of the white areas to red [344] For the 2006 Brazilian Grand Prix, he wore an all-red helmet that included the names of his ninety-one Grand Prix victories [345] At the 2011 Belgian Grand Prix, Schumacher's 20th anniversary in Formula One, he wore a commemorative gold-leafed helmet, which included the year of his debut and the seasons of his seven Drivers' titles [346] During his 300th Grand Prix appearance at the 2012 Belgian Grand Prix, Schumacher wore a platinum-leafed helmet with a message of his achievement [347]\n\n\nLegacy\nSchumacher's career spanned three decades, or twenty-three years, and left a lasting impact on the sport, Formula One in particular but also motorsport as a whole, and his influence extended beyond his own racing career By the time of his first retirement in 2006 and his final retirement in 2012, Schumacher was widely considered among the greatest Formula One drivers, [348] [349] [309] a trend that continued into the 2020s [350] [351] [352] Several commentators and drivers, including among others multi-time World Champions Niki Lauda and Sebastian Vettel, [34] [353] former rival David Coulthard, [354] former Formula One driver Giancarlo Fisichella, [355] and Mercedes team bosses Ross Brawn and Toto Wolff, [356] [357] have at times described him as the greatest of his era and the greatest of all time [33] Schumacher was the sport's most dominant force in the 2000s, [358] being described as statistically the most successful driver in Formula One history and the most complete Formula One driver ever [10] By 2004, Schumacher came to hold most major Formula One records, and by 2006 his name was inscribed in almost all of Formula One's record books, including for most World Championships (7), most wins (91), most podiums (155), most pole positions (68), and most fastest laps (77), [197] the latter a record he still holds Although several of his records were later equalled or beaten, such as the most wins in a season at 13 (a record he first broke in 1995 and then equalled in 2000 and 2001, and further improved in 2002 and 2004), by multiple-time World Champions like Vettel, [359] [360] Lewis Hamilton, [361] [362] [363] and Max Verstappen, [364] others remain his, such as his 100 percent podium finish in 2002 (17), [365] [366] which included eleven wins, five second places, and one third place [367]\n\n\nHonours\nSchumacher has been honoured many times In 1992, the German Motor Sport Federation awarded him the ONS Cup, the highest accolade in German motorsport; he also won the trophy in 1994, 1995, and 2002 [385] In 1993, he won a Bambi Award (Sports) and was the first racing driver to receive the Golden Steering Wheel [386] [387] In 1994 and from 2001 to 2003, Schumacher was voted European Sportsperson of the Year by the International Sports Press Association [388] He was voted by Polish Press Agency the European Sportsperson of the Year from 2001 to 2003 [389] In 1995 and from 2000 to 2002, he was named Autosport International Racing Driver of the Year [390] [391] Schumacher was voted German Sportspersonality of the Year in 1995 and 2004 [392] During the latter year, he was voted Germany's greatest sportsperson of the 20th century, beating Birgit Fischer and Steffi Graf to the accolade [393] For his sports achievements and his commitment to road safety, Schumacher was awarded Germany's highest sporting accolade, the Silbernes Lorbeerblatt, in 1997 [394] In 2002, for his contributions to sport and his contributions in raising awareness of child education, Schumacher was named as one of the UNESCO Champions for Sport [395]\n\n\nPersonal life and philanthropy\nIn August 1995, Schumacher married Corinna Betsch [422] They have two children, a daughter Gina-Maria (born 20 February 1997) and a son, Mick (born 22 March 1999) Schumacher has always been very protective of his private life and is known to dislike the celebrity spotlight [422] From 1992 to May 1996, Schumacher resided in the Fontvieille district in Monaco The family moved to a newly built mansion near Gland, Switzerland, in 2007, covering an area of 650-square-metre (7,000 sq ft) with a private beach on Lake Geneva and featuring an underground garage and petrol station, with a vintage Shell fuel pump [423] Schumacher and his wife own horse ranches in Texas and Switzerland [424] Schumacher's younger brother Ralf, his son Mick, his nephew David and step-brother Sebastian Stahl have also been racing drivers [425] Ralf Schumacher competed in Formula One for ten years, starting from 1997 until the end of 2007 [1] Mick became the third Schumacher to race in Formula One, having made his debut with Haas F1 Team in the 2021 season [426]\n\n\nFinance and sponsorship\nIn 1999 and 2000, Forbes magazine listed him as the highest paid athlete in the world [449] In 2005, EuroBusiness magazine identified Schumacher as the world's first billionaire athlete [450] In 2005, Forbes ranked him 17th in its \"The World's Most Powerful Celebrities\" list [451] A significant share of his income came from advertising; Deutsche Vermögensberatung paid him $8 million over three years from 1999 for wearing a 10 by 8 centimetre advertisement on his post-race cap [452] In 2010, his personal fortune was estimated at £515 million [453] In 2017, Forbes designated Schumacher as the athlete with the fifth highest career earnings of all-time [454]\n\n\n2013 skiing accident\nOn 29 December 2013, Schumacher was skiing with his then 14-year-old son Mick, descending the Combe de Saulire below the Dent de Burgin above Méribel in the French Alps An experienced skier, while crossing an unsecured off-piste area between Piste Chamois and Piste Mauduit, [455] [456] he fell and hit his head on a rock, sustaining a serious head injury despite wearing a ski helmet [457] [458] According to his physicians, he would most likely have died had he not been wearing a helmet [459] He was airlifted to Grenoble Hospital where he underwent two surgical interventions [460] Schumacher was put into a medically induced coma because of traumatic brain injury [461] [462] By March 2014, there were small encouraging signs In early April 2014, he was showing moments of consciousness as he was gradually withdrawn from the medically induced coma [463]\n\n\nKarting record\n(key) (Races in bold indicate pole position) (Races in italics indicate fastest lap)\n\n\nKarting career summary\n(key) (Races in bold indicate pole position) (Races in italics indicate fastest lap)\n\n\nRacing record\n(key) (Races in bold indicate pole position) (Races in italics indicate fastest lap)\n\n\nCareer summary\n(key) (Races in bold indicate pole position) (Races in italics indicate fastest lap)\n\n\nComplete German Formula Three results\n(key) (Races in bold indicate pole position) (Races in italics indicate fastest lap)\n\n\nComplete World Sportscar Championship results\n(key) (Races in bold indicate pole position;

{"title": "Global_warming", "content": "\nTerminology\nBefore the 1980s it was unclear whether the warming effect of increased greenhouse gases was stronger than the cooling effect of airborne particulates in air pollution Scientists used the term inadvertent climate modification to refer to human impacts on the climate at this time [28] In the 1980s, the terms global warming and climate change became more common, often being used interchangeably [29] [30] [31] Scientifically, global warming refers only to increased surface warming, while climate change describes both global warming and its effects on Earth's climate system, such as precipitation changes [28]\n\n\nGlobal temperature rise\nOver the last few million years the climate cycled through ice ages One of the hotter periods was the Last Interglacial, around 125,000 years ago, where temperatures were between 0.5 °C and 1.5 °C warmer than before the start of global warming [40] This period saw sea levels 5 to 10 metres higher than today The most recent glacial maximum 20,000 years ago was some 5–7 °C colder This period has sea levels that were over 125 metres (410 ft) lower than today [41]\n\n\nTemperatures prior to present-day global warming\nOver the last few million years the climate cycled through ice ages One of the hotter periods was the Last Interglacial, around 125,000 years ago, where temperatures were between 0.5 °C and 1.5 °C warmer than before the start of global warming [40] This period saw sea levels 5 to 10 metres higher than today The most recent glacial maximum 20,000 years ago was some 5–7 °C colder This period has sea levels that were over 125 metres (410 ft) lower than today [41]\n\n\nWarming since the Industrial Revolution\nAround 1850 thermometer records began to provide global coverage [50]\nBetween the 18th century and 1970 there was little net warming, as the warming impact of greenhouse gas emissions was offset by cooling from sulfur dioxide emissions Sulfur dioxide causes acid rain, but it also produces sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere, which reflect sunlight and cause global dimming After 1970, the increasing accumulation of greenhouse gases and controls on sulfur pollution led to a marked increase in temperature [51] [52] [53]\n\n\nDifferences by region\nDifferent regions of the world warm at different rates The pattern is independent of where greenhouse gases are emitted, because the gases persist long enough to diffuse across the planet Since the pre-industrial period, the average surface temperature over land regions has increased almost twice as fast as the global average surface temperature [71] This is because oceans lose more heat by evaporation and oceans can store a lot of heat [72] The thermal energy in the global climate system has grown with only brief pauses since at least 1970, and over 90% of this extra energy has been stored in the ocean [73] [74] The rest has heated the atmosphere, melted ice, and warmed the continents [75]\n\n\nFuture global temperatures\nThe World Meteorological Organization estimates there is an 80% chance that global temperatures will exceed 1.5 °C warming for at least one year between 2024 and 2028 The chance of the 5-year average being above 1.5 °C is almost half [87]\n\n\nCauses of recent global temperature rise\nThe climate system experiences various cycles on its own which can last for years, decades or even centuries For example, El Niño events cause short-term spikes in surface temperature while La Niña events cause short term cooling [95] Their relative frequency can affect global temperature trends on a decadal timescale [96] Other changes are caused by an imbalance of energy from external forcings [97] Examples of these include changes in the concentrations of greenhouse gases, solar luminosity, volcanic eruptions, and variations in the Earth's orbit around the Sun [98]\n\n\nGreenhouse gases\nGreenhouse gases are transparent to sunlight, and thus allow it to pass through the atmosphere to heat the Earth's surface The Earth radiates it as heat, and greenhouse gases absorb a portion of it This absorption slows the rate at which heat escapes into space, trapping heat near the Earth's surface and warming it over time [102]\n\n\nLand surface changes\nAround 30% of Earth's land area is largely unusable for humans (glaciers, deserts, etc.), 26% is forests, 10% is shrubland and 34% is agricultural land [125] Deforestation is the main land use change contributor to global warming, [126] as the destroyed trees release CO2, and are not replaced by new trees, removing that carbon sink [127] Between 2001 and 2018, 27% of deforestation was from permanent clearing to enable agricultural expansion for crops and livestock Another 24% has been lost to temporary clearing under the shifting cultivation agricultural systems 26% was due to logging for wood and derived products, and wildfires have accounted for the remaining 23% [128] Some forests have not been fully cleared, but were already degraded by these impacts Restoring these forests also recovers their potential as a carbon sink [129]\n\n\nOther factors\nAir pollution, in the form of aerosols, affects the climate on a large scale [132] Aerosols scatter and absorb solar radiation From 1961 to 1990, a gradual reduction in the amount of sunlight reaching the Earth's surface was observed This phenomenon is popularly known as global dimming, [133] and is primarily attributed to sulfate aerosols produced by the combustion of fossil fuels with heavy sulfur concentrations like coal and bunker fuel [53] Smaller contributions come from black carbon (from combustion of fossil fuels and biomass), and from dust [134] [135] [136] Globally, aerosols have been declining since 1990 due to pollution controls, meaning that they no longer mask greenhouse gas warming as much [137] [53]\n\n\nAerosols and clouds\nAir pollution, in the form of aerosols, affects the climate on a large scale [132] Aerosols scatter and absorb solar radiation From 1961 to 1990, a gradual reduction in the amount of sunlight reaching the Earth's surface was observed This phenomenon is popularly known as global dimming, [133] and is primarily attributed to sulfate aerosols produced by the combustion of fossil fuels with heavy sulfur concentrations like coal and bunker fuel [53] Smaller contributions come from black carbon (from combustion of fossil fuels and biomass), and from dust [134] [135] [136] Globally, aerosols have been declining since 1990 due to pollution controls, meaning that they no longer mask greenhouse gas warming as much [137] [53]\n\n\nSolar and volcanic activity\nAs the Sun is the Earth's primary energy source, changes in incoming sunlight directly affect the climate system [140] Solar irradiance has been measured directly by satellites, [147] and indirect measurements are available from the early 1600s onwards [140] Since 1880, there has been no upward trend in the amount of the Sun's energy reaching the Earth, in contrast to the warming of the lower atmosphere (the troposphere) [148] The upper atmosphere (the stratosphere) would also be warming if the Sun was sending more energy to Earth, but instead, it has been cooling [100]\nThis is consistent with greenhouse gases preventing heat from leaving the Earth's atmosphere [149]\n\n\nClimate change feedbacks\nThe climate system's response to an initial forcing is shaped by feedbacks, which either amplify or dampen the change Self-reinforcing or positive feedbacks increase the response, while balancing or negative feedbacks reduce it [154] The main reinforcing feedbacks are the water-vapour feedback, the ice–albedo feedback, and the net effect of clouds [155] [156] The primary balancing mechanism is radiative cooling, as Earth's surface gives off more heat to space in response to rising temperature [157] In addition to temperature feedbacks, there are feedbacks in the carbon cycle, such as the fertilizing effect of CO2 on plant growth [158] Feedbacks are expected to trend in a positive direction as greenhouse gas emissions continue, raising climate sensitivity [159]\n\n\nModelling\nA climate model is a representation of the physical, chemical and biological processes that affect the climate system [172] Models include natural processes like changes in the Earth's orbit, historical changes in the Sun's activity, and volcanic forcing [173] Models are used to estimate the degree of warming future emissions will cause when accounting for the strength of climate feedbacks [174] [175] Models also predict the circulation of the oceans, the annual cycle of the seasons, and the flows of carbon between the land surface and the atmosphere [176]\n\n\nImpacts\nThe environmental effects of climate change are broad and far-reaching, affecting oceans, ice, and weather Changes may occur gradually or rapidly Evidence for these effects comes from studying climate change in the past, from modelling, and from modern observations [186] Since the 1950s, droughts and heat waves have appeared simultaneously with increasing frequency [187] Extremely wet or dry events within the monsoon period have increased in India and East Asia [188] Monsoonal precipitation over the Northern Hemisphere has increased since 1980 [189] The rainfall rate and intensity of hurricanes and typhoons is likely increasing, [190] and the geographic range likely expanding poleward in response to climate warming [191] Frequency of tropical cyclones has not increased as a result of climate change [192]\n\n\nEnvironmental effects\nThe environmental effects of climate change are broad and far-reaching, affecting oceans, ice, and weather Changes may occur

Hemisphere has increased since 1980 [189] The rainfall rate and intensity of hurricanes and typhoons is likely increasing, [190] and the geographic range likely expanding poleward in response to climate warming [191] Frequency of tropical cyclones has not increased as a result of climate change [192]\n\n\nTipping points and long-term impacts\nGreater degrees of global warming increase the risk of passing through 'tipping points'—thresholds beyond which certain major impacts can no longer be avoided even if temperatures return to their previous state [205] [206] For instance, the Greenland ice sheet is already melting, but if global warming reaches levels between 1.7 °C and 2.3 °C, its melting will continue until it fully disappears If the warming is later reduced to 1.5 °C or less, it will still lose a lot more ice than if the warming was never allowed to reach the threshold in the first place [207] While the ice sheets would melt over millennia, other tipping points would occur faster and give societies less time to respond The collapse of major ocean currents like the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), and irreversible damage to key ecosystems like the Amazon rainforest and coral reefs can unfold in a matter of decades [204]\n\n\nNature and wildlife\nRecent warming has driven many terrestrial and freshwater species poleward and towards higher altitudes [215] For instance, the range of hundreds of North American birds has shifted northward at an average rate of 1.5 km/year over the past 55 years [216] Higher atmospheric CO2 levels and an extended growing season have resulted in global greening However, heatwaves and drought have reduced ecosystem productivity in some regions The future balance of these opposing effects is unclear [217] A related phenomenon driven by climate change is woody plant encroachment, affecting up to 500 million hectares globally [218] Climate change has contributed to the expansion of drier climate zones, such as the expansion of deserts in the subtropics [219] The size and speed of global warming is making abrupt changes in ecosystems more likely [220] Overall, it is expected that climate change will result in the extinction of many species [221]\n\n\nHumans\nThe effects of climate change are impacting humans everywhere in the world [233] Impacts can be observed on all continents and ocean regions, [234] with low-latitude, less developed areas facing the greatest risk [235] Continued warming has potentially \"severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts\" for people and ecosystems [236] The risks are unevenly distributed, but are generally greater for disadvantaged people in developing and developed countries [237]\n\n\nHealth and food\nThe World Health Organization calls climate change one of the biggest threats to global health in the 21st century [13] Scientists have warned about the irreversible harms it poses [238] Extreme weather events affect public health, and food and water security [239] [240] [241] Temperature extremes lead to increased illness and death [239] [240] Climate change increases the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events [240] [241] It can affect transmission of infectious diseases, such as dengue fever and malaria [238] [239] According to the World Economic Forum, 14.5 million more deaths are expected due to climate change by 2050 [242] 30% of the global population currently live in areas where extreme heat and humidity are already associated with excess deaths [243] [244] By 2100, 50% to 75% of the global population would live in such areas [243] [245]\n\n\nLivelihoods and inequality\nEconomic damages due to climate change may be severe and there is a chance of disastrous consequences [249] Severe impacts are expected in South-East Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, where most of the local inhabitants are dependent upon natural and agricultural resources [250] [251] Heat stress can prevent outdoor labourers from working If warming reaches 4 °C then labour capacity in those regions could be reduced by 30 to 50% [252] The World Bank estimates that between 2016 and 2030, climate change could drive over 120 million people into extreme poverty without adaptation [253]\n\n\nClimate migration\nLow-lying islands and coastal communities are threatened by sea level rise, which makes urban flooding more common Sometimes, land is permanently lost to the sea [259] This could lead to statelessness for people in island nations, such as the Maldives and Tuvalu [260] In some regions, the rise in temperature and humidity may be too severe for humans to adapt to [261] With worst-case climate change, models project that almost one-third of humanity might live in Sahara-like uninhabitable and extremely hot climates [262]\n\n\nReducing and recapturing emissions\nClimate change can be mitigated by reducing the rate at which greenhouse gases are emitted into the atmosphere, and by increasing the rate at which carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere [270] To limit global warming to less than 1.5 °C global greenhouse gas emissions needs to be net-zero by 2050, or by 2070 with a 2 °C target [271] This requires far-reaching, systemic changes on an unprecedented scale in energy, land, cities, transport, buildings, and industry [272]\n\n\nClean energy\nRenewable energy is key to limiting climate change [284] For decades, fossil fuels have accounted for roughly 80% of the world's energy use [285] The remaining share has been split between nuclear power and renewables (including hydropower, bioenergy, wind and solar power and geothermal energy) [286] Fossil fuel use is expected to peak in absolute terms prior to 2030 and then to decline, with coal use experiencing the sharpest reductions [287] Renewables represented 86% of all new electricity generation installed in 2023 [288] Other forms of clean energy, such as nuclear and hydropower, currently have a larger share of the energy supply However, their future growth forecasts appear limited in comparison [289]\n\n\nEnergy conservation\nReducing energy demand is another major aspect of reducing emissions [307] If less energy is needed, there is more flexibility for clean energy development It also makes it easier to manage the electricity grid, and minimizes carbon-intensive infrastructure development [308] Major increases in energy efficiency investment will be required to achieve climate goals, comparable to the level of investment in renewable energy [309] Several COVID-19 related changes in energy use patterns, energy efficiency investments, and funding have made forecasts for this decade more difficult and uncertain [310]\n\n\nAgriculture and industry\n Agriculture and forestry face a triple challenge of limiting greenhouse gas emissions, preventing the further conversion of forests to agricultural land, and meeting increases in world food demand [315] A set of actions could reduce agriculture and forestry-based emissions by two-thirds from 2010 levels These include reducing growth in demand for food and other agricultural products, increasing land productivity, protecting and restoring forests, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural production [316]\n\n\nCarbon dioxide removal\nNatural carbon sinks can be enhanced to sequester significantly larger amounts of CO2 beyond naturally occurring levels [323] Reforestation and afforestation (planting forests where there were none before) are among the most mature sequestration techniques, although the latter raises food security concerns [324] Farmers can promote sequestration of carbon in soils through practices such as use of winter cover crops, reducing the intensity and frequency of tillage, and using compost and manure as soil amendments [325] Forest and landscape restoration yields many benefits for the climate, including greenhouse gas emissions sequestration and reduction [129] Restoration/recreation of coastal wetlands, prairie plots and seagrass meadows increases the uptake of carbon into organic matter [326] [327] When carbon is sequestered in soils and in organic matter such as trees, there is a risk of the carbon being re-released into the atmosphere later through changes in land use, fire, or other changes in ecosystems [328]\n\n\nAdaptation\nAdaptation is \"the process of adjustment to current or expected changes in climate and its effects\" [331]: 5  Without additional mitigation, adaptation cannot avert the risk of \"severe, widespread and irreversible\" impacts [332] More severe climate change requires more transformative adaptation, which can be prohibitively expensive [333] The capacity and potential for humans to adapt is unevenly distributed across different regions and populations, and developing countries generally have less [334] The first two decades of the 21st century saw an increase in adaptive capacity in most low- and middle-income countries with improved access to basic sanitation and electricity, but progress is slow Many countries have implemented adaptation policies However, there is a considerable gap between necessary and available finance [335]\n\n\nPolicies and politics\nCountries that are most vulnerable to climate change have typically been responsible for a small share of global emissions This raises questions about justice and fairness [347] Limiting global warming makes it much easier to achieve the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, such as eradicating poverty and reducing inequalities The connection is recognized in Sustainable Development Goal 13 which is to \"take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts\" [348] The goals on food, clean water and ecosystem protection have synergies with climate mitigation [349]\n\n\nPolicy options\nA wide range of policies, regulations, and laws are being used to reduce emissions As of 2019, carbon pricing covers about 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions [352] Carbon can be priced with carbon taxes and emissions trading systems [353] Direct global fossil fuel subsidies reached $319 billion in 2017, and $5.2 trillion when indirect costs such as air pollution are priced in [354] Ending these can cause a 28% reduction in global carbon emissions and a 46% reduction in air pollution deaths [355] Money saved on fossil subsidies could be used to support the transition to clean energy instead [356] More direct methods to reduce greenhouse gases include vehicle efficiency standards, renewable fuel standards, and air pollution regulations on heavy industry [357] Several countries require utilities to increase the share of renewables in power production [358]\n\n\nClimate justice\nPolicy designed through the lens of climate justice tries to address human rights issues and social inequality According to proponents of climate justice, the costs of climate adaptation should be paid by those most responsible for climate change, while the beneficiaries of payments should be those suffering impacts One way this can be addressed in practice is to have wealthy nations pay poorer countries to adapt [359]\n\n\nInternational climate agreements\nNearly all countries in the world are parties to the 1994 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) [364] The goal of the UNFCCC is to prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system [365] As stated in the convention, this requires that greenhouse gas concentrations are stabilized in the atmosphere at a level where ecosystems can adapt naturally to climate change, food production is not threatened, and economic development can be sustained [366] The UNFCCC does not itself restrict emissions but rather provides a framework for protocols that do Global emissions have risen since the UNFCCC was signed [367] Its yearly conferences are the stage of global negotiations [368]\n\n\nNational responses\nIn 2019, the United Kingdom parliament became the first national government to declare a climate emergency [387] Other countries and jurisdictions followed suit [388] That same year, the European Parliament declared a \"climate and environmental emergency\" [389] The European Commission presented its European Green Deal with the goal of making the EU carbon-neutral by 2050 [390] In 2021, the European Commission released its \"Fit for 55\" legislation package, which contains guidelines for the car industry; all new cars on the European market must be zero-emission vehicles from 2035 [391]\n\n\nSociety\nPublic debate about climate change has been strongly affected by climate change denial and misinformation, which originated in the United States and has since spread to other countries, particularly Canada and Australia Climate change denial has originated from fossil fuel companies, industry groups, conservative think tanks, and contrarian scientists [397] Like the tobacco industry, the main strategy of these groups has been to manufacture doubt about climate-change related scientific data and results [398] People who hold unwarranted doubt about climate change are called climate change \"skeptics\", although \"contrarians\" or \"deniers\" are more appropriate terms [399]\n\n\nDenial and misinformation\nPublic debate about climate change has been strongly

\"deniers\" are more appropriate terms [399]\n\n\nPublic awareness and opinion\nClimate change came to international public attention in the late 1980s [407] Due to media coverage in the early 1990s, people often confused climate change with other environmental issues like ozone depletion [408] In popular culture, the climate fiction movie The Day After Tomorrow (2004) and the Al Gore documentary An Inconvenient Truth (2006) focused on climate change [407]\n\n\nClimate movement\nClimate protests demand that political leaders take action to prevent climate change They can take the form of public demonstrations, fossil fuel divestment, lawsuits and other activities [417] Prominent demonstrations include the School Strike for Climate In this initiative, young people across the globe have been protesting since 2018 by skipping school on Fridays, inspired by Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg [418] Mass civil disobedience actions by groups like Extinction Rebellion have protested by disrupting roads and public transport [419]\n\n\nHistory\nScientists in the 19th century such as Alexander von Humboldt began to foresee the effects of climate change [423] [424] [425] [426] In the 1820s, Joseph Fourier proposed the greenhouse effect to explain why Earth's temperature was higher than the Sun's energy alone could explain Earth's atmosphere is transparent to sunlight, so sunlight reaches the surface where it is converted to heat However, the atmosphere is not transparent to heat radiating from the surface, and captures some of that heat, which in turn warms the planet [427]\n\n\nEarly discoveries\nScientists in the 19th century such as Alexander von Humboldt began to foresee the effects of climate change [423] [424] [425] [426] In the 1820s, Joseph Fourier proposed

consensus\nIn the 1950s, Gilbert Plass created a detailed computer model that included different atmospheric layers and the infrared spectrum This model predicted that increasing CO2 levels would cause warming Around the same time, Hans Suess found evidence that CO2 levels had been rising, and Roger Revelle showed that the oceans would not absorb the increase The two scientists subsequently helped Charles Keeling to begin a record of continued increase, which has been termed the \"Keeling Curve\" [433] Scientists alerted the public, [439] and the dangers were highlighted at James Hansen's 1988 Congressional testimony [34] The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), set up in 1988 to provide formal advice to the world's governments, spurred interdisciplinary research [440] As part of the IPCC reports, scientists assess the scientific discussion that takes place in peer-reviewed journal articles [441]\n\n\nSee also\n This article incorporates text from a free

rise in the average surface temperature of the Earth due to the increasing levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. These gases, including carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor, trap heat from the sun and prevent it from escaping back into space, leading to a warming effect on the planet.\n\n**Terminology**\n\nBefore the 1980s, it was unclear whether the warming effect of increased greenhouse gases was stronger than the cooling effect of airborne particulates in air pollution. Scientists used the term \"inadvertent climate modification\" to refer to human impacts on the climate at this time. In the 1980s, the terms \"global warming\" and \"climate change\" became more common, often being used interchangeably. Scientifically, global warming refers only to increased surface warming, while climate change describes both global warming and its effects on Earth's climate system, such as precipitation changes.\n\n**Global Temperature Rise**\n\nOver the last few million years, the climate has cycled through ice ages. One of the hotter periods was the Last Interglacial, around 125,000 years ago, where temperatures were between 0.5°C and 1.5°C warmer than before the start of global warming. This period saw sea levels 5 to 10 meters higher than today. The most recent glacial maximum 20,000 years ago was some 5–7°C colder, with sea levels over 125 meters lower than today.\n\n**Temperatures Prior to Present-Day Global Warming**\n\nThe climate has cycled through ice ages, with warmer periods in between. The Last Interglacial, around 125,000 years ago, was warmer than today, with temperatures between 0.5°C and 1.5°C higher. This period saw sea levels 5 to 10 meters higher than today. The most recent glacial maximum 20,000 years ago was some 5–7°C colder, with sea levels over 125 meters lower than today.\n\n**Warming Since the Industrial Revolution**\n\nAround 1850, thermometer records began to provide global coverage. Between the 18th century and 1970, there was little net warming, as the warming impact of greenhouse gas emissions was offset by cooling from sulfur dioxide emissions. Sulfur dioxide causes acid rain, but it also produces sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere, which reflect sunlight and cause global dimming. After 1970, the increasing accumulation of greenhouse gases and controls on sulfur pollution led to a marked increase in temperature.\n\n**Differences by Region**\n\nDifferent regions of the world warm at different rates. The pattern is independent of where greenhouse gases are emitted, because the gases persist long enough to diffuse across the planet. Since the pre-industrial period, the average surface temperature over land regions has increased almost twice as fast as the global average surface temperature. This is because oceans lose more heat by evaporation and oceans can store a lot of heat. The thermal energy in the global climate system has grown with only brief pauses since at least 1970, and over 90% of this extra energy has been stored in the ocean.\n\n**Future Global Temperatures**\n\nThe World Meteorological Organization estimates there is an 80% chance that global temperatures will exceed 1.5°C warming for at least one year between 2024 and 2028. The chance of the 5-year average being above 1.5°C is almost half.\n\n**Causes of Recent Global Temperature Rise**\n\nThe climate system experiences various cycles on its own, which can last for years, decades, or even centuries. For example, El Niño events cause short-term spikes in surface temperature, while La Niña events cause short-term cooling. Their relative frequency can affect global temperature trends on a decadal timescale. Other changes are caused by an imbalance of energy from external forcings, such as changes in the concentrations of greenhouse gases, solar luminosity, volcanic eruptions, and variations in the Earth's orbit around the Sun.\n\n**Greenhouse Gases**\n\nGreenhouse gases are transparent to sunlight, and thus allow it to pass through the atmosphere to heat the Earth's surface. The Earth radiates it as heat, and greenhouse gases absorb a portion of it. This absorption slows the rate at which heat escapes into space, trapping heat near the Earth's surface and warming it over time.\n\n**Land Surface Changes**\n\nAround 30% of Earth's land area is largely unusable for humans (glaciers, deserts, etc.), 26% is forests, 10% is shrubland, and 34% is agricultural land. Deforestation is the main land use change contributor to global warming, as the destroyed trees release CO2, and are not replaced by new trees, removing that carbon sink.\n\n**Other Factors**\n\nAir pollution, in the form of aerosols, affects the climate on a large scale. Aerosols scatter and absorb solar radiation. From 1961 to 1990, a gradual reduction in the amount of sunlight reaching the Earth's surface was observed, known as global dimming. This phenomenon is primarily attributed to sulfate aerosols produced by the combustion of fossil fuels with heavy sulfur concentrations like coal and bunker fuel. Smaller contributions come from black carbon (from combustion of fossil fuels and biomass), and from dust.\n\n**Aerosols and Clouds**\n\nAir pollution, in the form of aerosols, affects the climate on a large scale. Aerosols scatter and absorb solar radiation. From 1961 to 1990, a gradual reduction in the amount of sunlight reaching the Earth's surface was observed, known as global dimming. This phenomenon is primarily attributed to sulfate aerosols produced by the combustion of fossil fuels with heavy sulfur concentrations like coal and bunker fuel. Smaller contributions come from black carbon (from combustion of fossil fuels and biomass), and from dust.\n\n**Solar and Volcanic Activity**\n\nAs the Sun is the Earth's primary energy source, changes in incoming sunlight directly affect the climate system. Solar irradiance has been measured directly by satellites, and indirect measurements are available from the early 1600s onwards. Since 1880, there has been no upward trend in the amount of the Sun's energy reaching the Earth, in contrast to the warming of the lower atmosphere (the troposphere). The upper atmosphere (the stratosphere) would also be warming if the Sun was sending more energy to Earth, but instead, it has been cooling, consistent with greenhouse gases preventing heat from leaving the Earth's atmosphere.\n\n**Climate Change Feedbacks**\n\nThe climate system's response to an initial forcing is shaped by feedbacks, which either amplify or dampen the change. Self-reinforcing or positive feedbacks increase the response, while balancing or negative feedbacks reduce it. The main reinforcing feedbacks are the water-vapor feedback, the ice-albedo feedback, and the net effect of clouds. The primary balancing mechanism is radiative cooling, as Earth's surface gives off more heat to space in response to rising temperature.\n\n**Modelling**\n\nA climate model is a representation of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that affect the climate system. Models include natural processes like changes in the Earth's orbit, historical changes in the Sun's activity, and volcanic forcing. Models are used to estimate the degree of warming future emissions will cause when accounting for the strength of climate feedbacks. Models also predict the circulation of the oceans, the annual cycle of the seasons, and the flows of carbon between the land surface and the atmosphere.\n\n**Impacts**\n\nThe environmental effects of climate change are broad and far-reaching, affecting oceans, ice, and weather. Changes may occur gradually or rapidly. Evidence for these effects comes from studying climate change in the past, from modelling, and from modern observations. Since the 1950s, droughts and heat waves have appeared simultaneously with increasing frequency. Extremely wet or dry events within the monsoon period have increased in India and East Asia. Monsoonal precipitation over the Northern Hemisphere has increased since 1980.\n\n**Tipping Points and Long-term Impacts**\n\nGreater degrees of global warming increase the risk of passing through 'tipping points' – thresholds beyond which certain major impacts can no longer be avoided even if temperatures return to their previous state. For instance, the Greenland ice sheet is already melting, but if global warming reaches levels between 1.7°C and 2.3°C, its melting will continue until it fully disappears. While the ice sheets would melt over millennia, other tipping points would occur faster and give societies less time to respond. The collapse of major ocean currents like the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), and irreversible damage to key ecosystems like the Amazon rainforest and coral reefs can unfold in a matter of decades.\n\n**Nature and Wildlife**\n\nRecent warming has driven many terrestrial and freshwater species poleward and towards higher altitudes. For instance, the range of hundreds of North American birds has shifted northward at an average rate of 1.5 km/year over the past 55 years. Higher atmospheric CO2 levels and an extended growing season have resulted in global greening. However, heatwaves and drought have reduced ecosystem productivity in some regions. The future balance of these opposing effects is unclear. A related phenomenon driven by climate change is woody plant encroachment, affecting up to 500 million hectares globally. Climate change has contributed to the expansion of drier climate zones, such as the expansion of deserts in the subtropics.\n\n**Humans**\n\nThe effects of climate change are impacting humans everywhere in the world. Impacts can be observed on all continents and ocean regions, with low-latitude, less developed areas facing the greatest risk. Continued warming has potentially \"severe, pervasive, and irreversible impacts\" for people and ecosystems. The risks are unevenly distributed, but are generally greater for disadvantaged people in developing and developed countries.\n\n**Health and Food**\n\nThe World Health Organization calls climate change one of the biggest threats to global health in the 21st century. Scientists have warned about the irreversible harms it poses. Extreme weather events affect public health, and food and water security. Temperature extremes lead to increased illness and death. Climate change increases the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events. It can affect transmission of infectious diseases, such as dengue fever and malaria.\n\n**Livelihoods and Inequality**\n\nEconomic damages due to climate change may be severe, and there is a chance of disastrous consequences. Severe impacts are expected in South-East Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, where most of the local inhabitants are dependent upon natural and agricultural resources. Heat stress can prevent outdoor laborers from working. If warming reaches 4°C, labor capacity in those regions could be reduced by 30 to 50%. The World Bank estimates that between 2016 and 2030, climate change could drive over 120 million people into extreme poverty without adaptation.\n\n**Climate Migration**\n\nLow-lying islands and coastal communities are threatened by sea level rise, which makes urban flooding more common. Sometimes, land is permanently lost to the sea. This could lead to statelessness for people in island nations, such as the Maldives and Tuvalu. In some regions, the rise in temperature and humidity may be too severe for humans to adapt to. With worst-case climate change, models project that almost one-third of humanity might live in Sahara-like uninhabitable and extremely hot climates.\n\n**Reducing and Recapturing Emissions**\n\nClimate change can be mitigated by reducing the rate at which greenhouse gases are emitted into the atmosphere, and by increasing the rate at which carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere. To limit global warming to less than 1.5°C, global greenhouse gas emissions need to be net-zero by 2050, or by 2070 with a 2°C target. This requires far-reaching, systemic changes on an unprecedented scale in energy, land, cities, transport, buildings, and industry.\n\n**Clean Energy**\n\nRenewable energy is key to limiting climate change. For decades, fossil fuels have accounted for roughly 80% of the world's energy use. The remaining share has been split between nuclear power and renewables (including hydropower, bioenergy, wind and solar power, and geothermal energy). Fossil fuel use is expected to peak in absolute terms prior to 2030 and then to decline, with coal use experiencing the sharpest reductions. Renewables represented 86% of all new electricity generation installed in 2023.\n\n**Energy Conservation**\n\nReducing energy demand is another major aspect of reducing emissions. If less energy is needed, there is more flexibility for clean energy development. It also makes it easier to manage the electricity grid, and minimizes carbon-intensive infrastructure development. Major increases in energy efficiency investment will be required to achieve climate goals, comparable to the level of investment in renewable energy.\n\n**Agriculture and Industry**\n\nAgriculture and forestry face a triple challenge of limiting greenhouse gas emissions, preventing the further conversion of forests to agricultural land, and meeting increases in world food demand. A set of actions could reduce agriculture and forestry-based emissions by two-thirds from 2010 levels. These include reducing growth in demand for food and other agricultural products, increasing land productivity, protecting and restoring forests, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural production.\n\n**Carbon Dioxide Removal**\n\nNatural carbon sinks can be enhanced to sequester significantly larger amounts of CO2 beyond naturally occurring levels. Reforestation and afforestation (planting forests where there were none before) are among the most mature sequestration techniques, although the latter raises food security concerns. Farmers can promote sequestration of carbon in soils through practices such as use of winter cover crops, reducing the intensity and frequency of tillage, and using compost and manure as soil amendments.\n\n**Adaptation**\n\nAdaptation is \"the process of adjustment to current or expected changes in climate and its effects.\" Without additional mitigation, adaptation cannot avert the risk of \"severe, widespread, and irreversible\" impacts.

The connection is recognized in Sustainable Development Goal 13, which is to \"take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.\"\n\n**Policy Options**\n\nA wide range of policies, regulations, and laws are being used to reduce emissions. As of 2019, carbon pricing covers about 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Carbon can be priced with carbon taxes and emissions trading systems. Direct global fossil fuel subsidies reached $319 billion in 2017, and $5.2 trillion when indirect costs such as air pollution are priced in. Ending these can cause a 28% reduction in global carbon emissions and a 46% reduction in air pollution deaths.\n\n**Climate Justice**\n\nPolicy designed through the lens of climate justice tries to address human rights issues and social inequality. According to proponents of climate justice, the costs of climate adaptation should be paid by those most responsible for climate change, while the beneficiaries of payments should be those suffering impacts. One way this can be addressed in practice is to have wealthy nations pay poorer countries to adapt.\n\n**International Climate Agreements**\n\nNearly all countries in the world are parties to the 1994 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The goal of the UNFCCC is to prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system. As stated in the convention, this requires that greenhouse gas concentrations are stabilized in the atmosphere at a level where ecosystems can adapt naturally to climate change, food production is not threatened, and economic development can be sustained.\n\n**National Responses**\n\nIn 2019, the United Kingdom parliament became the first national government to declare a climate emergency. Other countries and jurisdictions followed suit. That same year, the European Parliament declared a \"climate and environmental emergency.\" The European Commission presented its European Green Deal with the goal of making the EU carbon-neutral by 2050.\n\n**Society**\n\nPublic debate about climate change has been strongly affected by climate change denial and misinformation, which originated in the United States and has since spread to other countries, particularly Canada and Australia.

In popular culture, the climate fiction movie The Day After Tomorrow (2004) and the Al Gore documentary An Inconvenient Truth (2006) focused on climate change.\n\n**Climate Movement**\n\nClimate protests demand that political leaders take action to prevent climate change. They can take the form of public demonstrations, fossil fuel divestment, lawsuits, and other activities. Prominent demonstrations include the School Strike for Climate, in which young people across the globe have been protesting since 2018 by skipping school on Fridays, inspired by Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg.\n\n**History**\n\nScientists in the 19th century, such as Alexander von Humboldt, began to foresee the effects of climate change. In the 1820s, Joseph Fourier proposed the greenhouse effect to explain why Earth's temperature was higher than the Sun's energy alone could explain. Earth's atmosphere is transparent to sunlight, so sunlight reaches the surface where it is converted to heat. However, the atmosphere is not transparent to heat radiating from the surface, and captures some of that heat, which in turn warms the planet.\n\n**Development of a Scientific Consensus**\n\nIn the 1950s, Gilbert Plass created a detailed computer model that included different atmospheric layers and the infrared spectrum. This model predicted that increasing CO2 levels would cause warming. Around the same time, Hans Suess found evidence that CO2 levels had been rising, and Roger Revelle showed that the oceans would not absorb the increase. The two scientists subsequently helped Charles Keeling to begin a record of continued increase, which has been termed the \"Keeling Curve.\"\n\n**See Also**\n\nThis article incorporates text from a free content work licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0.

documents\n\n**Non-Technical Sources**\n\nExternal links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Global_warming\" following this outline:\n\n\nTerminology\nBefore the 1980s it was unclear whether the warming effect of increased greenhouse gases was stronger than the cooling effect of airborne particulates in air pollution Scientists used the term inadvertent climate modification to refer to human impacts on the climate at this time [28] In the 1980s, the terms global warming and climate change became more common, often being used interchangeably [29] [30] [31] Scientifically, global warming refers only to increased surface warming, while climate change describes both global warming and its effects on Earth's climate system, such as precipitation changes [28]\n\n\nGlobal temperature rise\nOver the last few million years the climate cycled through ice ages One of the hotter periods was the Last Interglacial, around 125,000 years ago, where temperatures were between 0.5 °C and 1.5 °C warmer than before the start of global warming [40] This period saw sea levels 5 to 10 metres higher than today The most recent glacial maximum 20,000 years ago was some 5–7 °C colder This period has sea levels that were over 125 metres (410 ft) lower than today [41]\n\n\nTemperatures prior to present-day global warming\nOver the last few million years the climate cycled through ice ages One of the hotter periods was the Last Interglacial, around 125,000 years ago, where temperatures were between 0.5 °C and 1.5 °C warmer than before the start of global warming [40] This period saw sea levels 5 to 10 metres higher than today The most recent glacial maximum 20,000 years ago was some 5–7 °C colder This period has sea levels that were over 125 metres (410 ft) lower than today [41]\n\n\nWarming since the Industrial Revolution\nAround 1850 thermometer records began to provide global coverage [50]\nBetween the 18th century and 1970 there was little net warming, as the warming impact of greenhouse gas emissions was offset by cooling from sulfur dioxide emissions Sulfur dioxide causes acid rain, but it also produces sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere, which reflect sunlight and cause global dimming After 1970, the increasing accumulation of greenhouse gases and controls on sulfur pollution led to a marked increase in temperature [51] [52] [53]\n\n\nDifferences by region\nDifferent regions of the world warm at different rates The pattern is independent of where greenhouse gases are emitted, because the gases persist long enough to diffuse across the planet Since the pre-industrial period, the average surface temperature over land regions has increased almost twice as fast as the global average surface temperature [71] This is because oceans lose more heat by evaporation and oceans can store a lot of heat [72] The thermal energy in the global climate system has grown with only brief pauses since at least 1970, and over 90% of this extra energy has been stored in the ocean [73] [74] The rest has heated the atmosphere, melted ice, and warmed the continents [75]\n\n\nFuture global temperatures\nThe World Meteorological Organization estimates there is an 80% chance that global temperatures will exceed 1.5 °C warming for at least one year between 2024 and 2028 The chance of the 5-year average being above 1.5 °C is almost half [87]\n\n\nCauses of recent global temperature rise\nThe climate system experiences various cycles on its own which can last for years, decades or even centuries For example, El Niño events cause short-term spikes in surface temperature while La Niña events cause short term cooling [95] Their relative frequency can affect global temperature trends on a decadal timescale [96] Other changes are caused by an imbalance of energy from external forcings [97] Examples of these include changes in the concentrations of greenhouse gases, solar luminosity, volcanic eruptions, and variations in the Earth's orbit around the Sun [98]\n\n\nGreenhouse gases\nGreenhouse gases are transparent to sunlight, and thus allow it to pass through the atmosphere to heat the Earth's surface The Earth radiates it as heat, and greenhouse gases absorb a portion of it This absorption slows the rate at which heat escapes into space, trapping heat near the Earth's surface and warming it over time [102]\n\n\nLand surface changes\nAround 30% of Earth's land area is largely unusable for humans (glaciers, deserts, etc.), 26% is forests, 10% is shrubland and 34% is agricultural land [125] Deforestation is the main land use change contributor to global warming, [126] as the destroyed trees release CO2, and are not replaced by new trees, removing that carbon sink [127] Between 2001 and 2018, 27% of deforestation was from permanent clearing to enable agricultural expansion for crops and livestock Another 24% has been lost to temporary clearing under the shifting cultivation agricultural systems 26% was due to logging for wood and derived products, and wildfires have accounted for the remaining 23% [128] Some forests have not been fully cleared, but were already degraded by these impacts Restoring these forests also recovers their potential as a carbon sink [129]\n\n\nOther factors\nAir pollution, in the form of aerosols, affects the climate on a large scale [132] Aerosols scatter and absorb solar radiation From 1961 to 1990, a gradual reduction in the amount of sunlight reaching the Earth's surface was observed This phenomenon is popularly known as global dimming, [133] and is primarily attributed to sulfate aerosols produced by the combustion of fossil fuels with heavy sulfur concentrations like coal and bunker fuel [53] Smaller contributions come from black carbon (from combustion of fossil fuels and biomass), and from dust [134] [135] [136] Globally, aerosols have been declining since 1990 due to pollution controls, meaning that they no longer mask greenhouse gas warming as much [137] [53]\n\n\nAerosols and clouds\nAir pollution, in the form of aerosols, affects the climate on a large scale [132] Aerosols scatter and absorb solar radiation From 1961 to 1990, a gradual reduction in the amount of sunlight reaching the Earth's surface was observed This phenomenon is popularly known as global dimming, [133] and is primarily

of fossil fuels and biomass), and from dust [134] [135] [136] Globally, aerosols have been declining since 1990 due to pollution controls, meaning that they no longer mask greenhouse gas warming as much [137] [53]\n\n\nSolar and volcanic activity\nAs the Sun is the Earth's primary energy source, changes in incoming sunlight directly affect the climate system [140] Solar irradiance has been measured directly by satellites, [147] and indirect measurements are available from the early 1600s onwards [140] Since 1880, there has been no upward trend in the amount of the Sun's energy reaching the Earth, in contrast to the warming of the lower atmosphere (the troposphere) [148] The upper atmosphere (the stratosphere) would also be warming if the Sun was sending more energy to Earth, but instead, it has been cooling [100]\nThis is consistent with greenhouse gases preventing heat from leaving the Earth's atmosphere [149]\n\n\nClimate change feedbacks\nThe climate system's response to an initial forcing is shaped by feedbacks, which either amplify or dampen the change Self-reinforcing or positive feedbacks increase the response, while balancing or negative feedbacks reduce it [154] The main reinforcing feedbacks are the water-vapour feedback, the ice–albedo feedback, and the net effect of clouds [155] [156] The primary balancing mechanism is radiative cooling, as Earth's surface gives off more heat to space in response to rising temperature [157] In addition to temperature feedbacks, there are feedbacks in the carbon cycle, such as the fertilizing effect of CO2 on plant growth [158] Feedbacks are expected to trend in a positive direction as greenhouse gas emissions continue, raising climate sensitivity [159]\n\n\nModelling\nA climate model is a representation of the physical, chemical and biological processes that affect the climate system [172] Models include natural processes like changes in the Earth's orbit, historical changes in the Sun's activity, and volcanic forcing [173] Models are used to estimate the degree of warming future emissions will cause when accounting for the strength of climate feedbacks [174] [175] Models also predict the circulation of the oceans, the annual cycle of the seasons, and the flows of carbon between the land surface and the atmosphere [176]\n\n\nImpacts\nThe environmental effects of climate change are broad and far-reaching, affecting oceans, ice, and weather Changes may occur gradually or rapidly Evidence for these effects comes from studying climate change in the past, from modelling, and from modern observations [186] Since the 1950s, droughts and heat waves have appeared simultaneously with increasing frequency [187] Extremely wet or dry events within the monsoon period have increased in India and East Asia [188] Monsoonal precipitation over the Northern Hemisphere has increased since 1980 [189] The rainfall rate and intensity of hurricanes and typhoons is likely increasing, [190] and the geographic range likely expanding poleward in response to climate warming [191] Frequency of tropical cyclones has not increased as a result of climate change [192]\n\n\nEnvironmental effects\nThe environmental effects of climate change are broad and far-reaching, affecting oceans, ice, and weather Changes may occur gradually or rapidly Evidence for these effects comes from studying climate change in the past, from modelling, and from modern observations [186] Since the 1950s, droughts and heat waves have appeared simultaneously with increasing frequency [187] Extremely wet or dry events

and typhoons is likely increasing, [190] and the geographic range likely expanding poleward in response to climate warming [191] Frequency of tropical cyclones has not increased as a result of climate change [192]\n\n\nTipping points and long-term impacts\nGreater degrees of global warming increase the risk of passing through 'tipping points'—thresholds beyond which certain major impacts can no longer be avoided even if temperatures return to their previous state [205] [206] For instance, the Greenland ice sheet is already melting, but if global warming reaches levels between 1.7 °C and 2.3 °C, its melting will continue until it fully disappears If the warming is later reduced to 1.5 °C or less, it will still lose a lot more ice than if the warming was never allowed to reach the threshold in the first place [207] While the ice sheets would melt over millennia, other tipping points would occur faster and give societies less time to respond The collapse of major ocean currents like the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), and irreversible damage to key ecosystems like the Amazon rainforest and coral reefs can unfold in a matter of decades [204]\n\n\nNature and wildlife\nRecent warming has driven many terrestrial and freshwater species poleward and towards higher altitudes [215] For instance, the range of hundreds of North American birds has shifted northward at an average rate of 1.5 km/year over the past 55 years [216] Higher atmospheric CO2 levels and an extended growing season have resulted in global greening However, heatwaves and drought have reduced ecosystem productivity in some regions The future balance of these opposing effects is unclear [217] A related phenomenon driven by climate change is woody plant encroachment, affecting up to 500 million hectares globally [218] Climate change has contributed to the expansion of drier climate zones, such as the expansion of deserts in the subtropics [219] The size and speed of global warming is making abrupt changes in ecosystems more likely [220] Overall, it is expected that climate change will result in the extinction of many species [221]\n\n\nHumans\nThe effects of climate change are impacting humans everywhere in the world [233] Impacts can be observed on all continents and ocean regions, [234] with low-latitude, less developed areas facing the greatest risk [235] Continued warming has potentially \"severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts\" for people and ecosystems [236] The risks are unevenly distributed, but are generally greater for disadvantaged people in developing and developed countries [237]\n\n\nHealth and food\nThe World Health Organization calls climate change one of the biggest threats to global health in the 21st century [13] Scientists have warned about the irreversible harms it poses [238] Extreme weather events affect public health, and food and water security [239] [240] [241] Temperature extremes lead to increased illness and death [239] [240] Climate change increases the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events [240] [241] It can affect transmission of infectious diseases, such as dengue fever and malaria [238] [239] According to the World Economic Forum, 14.5 million more deaths are expected due to climate change by 2050 [242] 30% of the global population currently live in areas where extreme heat and humidity are already associated with excess deaths [243] [244] By 2100, 50% to 75% of the global population would live in such areas [243] [245]\n\n\nLivelihoods and inequality\nEconomic damages due to climate change may be severe and there is a chance of disastrous consequences [249] Severe impacts are expected in South-East Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, where most of the local inhabitants are dependent upon natural and agricultural resources [250] [251] Heat stress can prevent outdoor labourers from working If warming reaches 4 °C then labour capacity in those regions could be reduced by 30 to 50% [252] The World Bank estimates that between 2016 and 2030, climate change could drive over 120 million people into extreme poverty without adaptation [253]\n\n\nClimate migration\nLow-lying islands and coastal communities are threatened by sea level rise, which makes urban flooding more common Sometimes, land is permanently lost to the sea [259] This could lead to statelessness for people in island nations, such as the Maldives and Tuvalu [260] In some regions, the rise in temperature and humidity may be too severe for humans to adapt to [261] With worst-case climate change, models project that almost one-third of humanity might live in Sahara-like uninhabitable and extremely hot climates [262]\n\n\nReducing and recapturing emissions\nClimate change can be mitigated by reducing the rate at which greenhouse gases are emitted into the atmosphere, and by increasing the rate at which carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere [270] To limit global warming to less than 1.5 °C global greenhouse gas emissions needs to be net-zero by 2050, or by 2070 with a 2 °C target [271] This requires far-reaching, systemic changes on an unprecedented scale in energy, land, cities, transport, buildings, and industry [272]\n\n\nClean energy\nRenewable energy is key to limiting climate change [284] For decades, fossil fuels have accounted for roughly 80% of the world's energy use [285] The remaining share has been split between nuclear power and renewables (including hydropower, bioenergy, wind and solar power and geothermal energy) [286] Fossil fuel use is expected to peak in absolute terms prior to 2030 and then to decline, with coal use experiencing the sharpest reductions [287] Renewables represented 86% of all new electricity generation installed in 2023 [288] Other forms of clean energy, such as nuclear and hydropower, currently have a larger share of the energy supply However, their future growth forecasts appear limited in comparison [289]\n\n\nEnergy conservation\nReducing energy demand is another major aspect of reducing emissions [307] If less energy is needed, there is more flexibility for clean energy development It also makes it easier to manage the electricity grid, and minimizes carbon-intensive infrastructure development [308] Major increases in energy efficiency investment will be required to achieve climate goals, comparable to the level of investment in renewable energy [309] Several COVID-19 related changes in energy use patterns, energy efficiency investments, and funding have made forecasts for this decade more difficult and uncertain [310]\n\n\nAgriculture and industry\n Agriculture and forestry face a triple challenge of limiting greenhouse gas emissions, preventing the further conversion of forests to agricultural land, and meeting increases in world food demand [315] A set of actions could reduce agriculture and forestry-based emissions by two-thirds from 2010 levels These include reducing growth in demand for food and other agricultural products, increasing land productivity, protecting and restoring forests, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural production [316]\n\n\nCarbon dioxide removal\nNatural carbon sinks can be enhanced to sequester significantly larger amounts of CO2 beyond naturally occurring levels [323] Reforestation and afforestation (planting forests where there were none before) are among the most mature sequestration techniques, although the latter raises food security concerns [324] Farmers can promote sequestration of carbon in soils through practices such as use of winter cover crops, reducing the intensity and frequency of tillage, and using compost and manure as soil amendments [325] Forest and landscape restoration yields many benefits for the climate, including greenhouse gas emissions sequestration and reduction [129] Restoration/recreation of coastal wetlands, prairie plots and seagrass meadows increases the uptake of carbon into organic matter [326] [327] When carbon is sequestered in soils and in organic matter such as trees, there is a risk of the carbon being re-released into the atmosphere later through changes in land use, fire, or other changes in ecosystems [328]\n\n\nAdaptation\nAdaptation is \"the process of adjustment to current or expected changes in climate and its effects\" [331]: 5  Without additional mitigation, adaptation cannot avert the risk of \"severe, widespread and irreversible\" impacts [332] More severe climate change requires more transformative adaptation, which can be prohibitively expensive [333] The capacity and potential for humans to adapt is unevenly distributed across different regions and populations, and developing countries generally have less [334] The first two decades of the 21st century saw an increase in adaptive capacity in most low- and middle-income countries with improved access to basic sanitation and electricity, but progress is slow Many countries have implemented adaptation policies However, there is a considerable gap between necessary and available finance [335]\n\n\nPolicies and politics\nCountries that are most vulnerable to climate change have typically been responsible for a small share of global emissions This raises questions about justice and fairness [347] Limiting global warming makes it much easier to achieve the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, such as eradicating poverty and reducing inequalities The connection is recognized in Sustainable Development Goal 13 which is to \"take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts\" [348] The goals on food, clean water and ecosystem protection have synergies with climate mitigation [349]\n\n\nPolicy options\nA wide range of policies, regulations, and laws are being used to reduce emissions As of 2019, carbon pricing covers about 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions [352] Carbon can be priced with carbon taxes and emissions trading systems [353] Direct global fossil fuel subsidies reached $319 billion in 2017, and $5.2 trillion when indirect costs such as air pollution are priced in [354] Ending these can cause a 28% reduction in global carbon emissions and a 46% reduction in air pollution deaths [355] Money saved on fossil subsidies could be used to support the transition to clean energy instead [356] More direct methods to reduce greenhouse gases include vehicle efficiency standards, renewable fuel standards, and air pollution regulations on heavy industry [357] Several countries require utilities to increase the share of renewables in power production [358]\n\n\nClimate justice\nPolicy designed through the lens of climate justice tries to address human rights issues and social inequality According to proponents of climate justice, the costs of climate adaptation should be paid by those most responsible for climate change, while the beneficiaries of payments should be those suffering impacts One way this can be addressed in practice is to have wealthy nations pay poorer countries to adapt [359]\n\n\nInternational climate agreements\nNearly all countries in the world are parties to the 1994 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) [364] The goal of the UNFCCC is to prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system [365] As stated in the convention, this requires that greenhouse gas concentrations are stabilized in the atmosphere at a level where ecosystems can adapt naturally to climate change, food production is not threatened, and economic development can be sustained [366] The UNFCCC does not itself restrict emissions but rather provides a framework for protocols that do Global emissions have risen since the UNFCCC was signed [367] Its yearly conferences are the stage of global negotiations [368]\n\n\nNational responses\nIn 2019, the United Kingdom parliament became the first national government to declare a climate emergency [387] Other countries and jurisdictions followed suit [388] That same year, the European Parliament declared a \"climate and environmental emergency\" [389] The European Commission presented its European Green Deal with the goal of making the EU carbon-neutral by 2050 [390] In 2021, the European Commission released its \"Fit for 55\" legislation package, which contains guidelines for the car industry; all new cars on the European market must be zero-emission vehicles from 2035 [391]\n\n\nSociety\nPublic debate about climate change has been strongly affected by climate change denial and misinformation, which originated in the United States and has since spread to other countries, particularly Canada and Australia Climate change denial has originated from fossil fuel companies, industry groups, conservative think tanks, and contrarian scientists [397] Like the tobacco industry, the main strategy of these groups has been to manufacture doubt about climate-change related scientific data and results [398] People who hold unwarranted doubt about climate change are called climate change \"skeptics\", although \"contrarians\" or \"deniers\" are more appropriate terms [399]\n\n\nDenial and misinformation\nPublic

\"skeptics\", although \"contrarians\" or \"deniers\" are more appropriate terms [399]\n\n\nPublic awareness and opinion\nClimate change came to international public attention in the late 1980s [407] Due to media coverage in the early 1990s, people often confused climate change with other environmental issues like ozone depletion [408] In popular culture, the climate fiction movie The Day After Tomorrow (2004) and the Al Gore documentary An Inconvenient Truth (2006) focused on climate change [407]\n\n\nClimate movement\nClimate protests demand that political leaders take action to prevent climate change They can take the form of public demonstrations, fossil fuel divestment, lawsuits and other activities [417] Prominent demonstrations include the School Strike for Climate In this initiative, young people across the globe have been protesting since 2018 by skipping school on Fridays, inspired by Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg [418] Mass civil disobedience actions by groups like Extinction Rebellion have protested by disrupting roads and public transport [419]\n\n\nHistory\nScientists in the 19th century such as Alexander von Humboldt began to foresee the effects of climate change [423] [424] [425] [426] In the 1820s, Joseph Fourier proposed the greenhouse effect to explain why Earth's temperature was higher than the Sun's energy alone could explain Earth's

dangers were highlighted at James Hansen's 1988 Congressional testimony [34] The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), set up in 1988 to provide formal advice to the world's governments, spurred interdisciplinary research [440] As part of the IPCC reports, scientists assess the scientific discussion that takes place in peer-reviewed journal articles [441]\n\n\nSee also\n This article

{"title": "Latvia", "content": "\nEtymology\nThe name Latvija is derived from the name of the ancient Latgalians, one of four Indo-European Baltic tribes (along with Curonians, Selonians and Semigallians), which formed the ethnic core of modern Latvians together with the Finnic Livonians [21] Henry of Latvia coined the latinisations of the country's name, \"Lettigallia\" and \"Lethia\", both derived from the Latgalians The terms inspired the variations on the country's name in Romance languages from \"Letonia\" and in several Germanic languages from \"Lettland\" [22]\n\n\nHistory\nAround 3000 BC, the Proto-Baltic ancestors of the Latvian people settled on the eastern coast of the Baltic Sea [23] The Balts established trade routes to Rome and Byzantium, trading local amber for precious metals [24] By 900 AD, four distinct Baltic tribes inhabited Latvia: Curonians, Latgalians, Selonians, Semigallians (in Latvian: kurši, latgaļi, sēļi and zemgaļi), as well as the Finnic tribe of Livonians (lībieši) speaking a Finnic language [25]\n\n\nMedieval period\nAlthough the local people had contact with the outside world for centuries, they became more fully integrated into the European socio-political system in the 12th century [27] The first missionaries, sent by the Pope, sailed up the Daugava River in the late 12th century, seeking converts [28] The local people, however, did not convert to Christianity as readily as the Church had hoped [28]\n\n\nReformation period and Polish and Swedish rule\nAfter the Livonian War (1558–1583), Livonia (Northern Latvia & Southern Estonia) fell under Polish and Lithuanian rule [28] The southern part of Estonia and the northern part of Latvia were ceded to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and formed into the Duchy of Livonia (Ducatus Livoniae Ultradunensis) Gotthard Kettler, the last Master of the Order of Livonia, formed the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia [34] Though the duchy was a vassal state to the Lithuanian Grand Duchy and later of the Polish and Lithuanian commonwealth, it retained a considerable degree of autonomy and experienced a golden age in the 16th century Latgalia, the easternmost region of Latvia, became a part of the Inflanty Voivodeship of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth [35]\n\n\nLivonia & Courland in the Russian Empire (1795–1917)\nDuring the Great Northern War (1700–1721), up to 40 percent of Latvians died from famine and plague [45] Half the residents of Riga were killed by plague in 1710–1711 [46] The capitulation of Estonia and Livonia in 1710 and the Treaty of Nystad, ending the Great Northern War in 1721, gave Vidzeme to Russia (it became part of the Riga Governorate)  The Latgale region remained part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth as Inflanty Voivodeship until 1772, when it was incorporated into Russia The Duchy of Courland and Semigallia, a vassal state of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, was annexed by Russia in 1795 in the Third Partition of Poland, bringing all of what is now Latvia into the Russian Empire All three Baltic provinces preserved local laws, German as the local official language and their own parliament, the Landtag.\n\n\nNational awakening\nDuring the 19th century, the social structure changed dramatically [49] A class of independent farmers established itself after reforms allowed the peasants to repurchase their land, but many landless peasants remained, quite a lot Latvians left for the cities and sought for education, industrial jobs [49] There also developed a growing urban proletariat and an increasingly influential Latvian bourgeoisie [49] The Young Latvian (Latvian: Jaunlatvieši) movement laid the groundwork for nationalism from the middle of the century, many of its leaders looking to the Slavophiles for support against the prevailing German-dominated social order [50] [51] The rise in use of the Latvian language in literature and society became known as the First National Awakening [50] Russification began in Latgale after the Polish led the January Uprising in 1863: this spread to the rest of what is now Latvia by the 1880s The Young Latvians were largely eclipsed by the New Current, a broad leftist social and political movement, in the 1890s [52] Popular discontent exploded in the 1905 Russian Revolution, which took a nationalist character in the Baltic provinces [53]\n\n\nDeclaration of independence and interwar period\nWorld War I devastated the territory of what became the state of Latvia, and other western parts of the Russian Empire Demands for self-determination were initially confined to autonomy, until a power vacuum was created by the Russian Revolution in 1917, followed by the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk between Russia and Germany in March 1918, then the Allied armistice with Germany on 11 November 1918 On 18 November 1918, in Riga, the People's Council of Latvia proclaimed the independence of the new country and Kārlis Ulmanis was entrusted to set up a government and he took the position of prime minister [54]\n\n\nLatvia in World War II\nEarly in the morning of 24 August 1939, the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany signed a 10-year non-aggression pact, called the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact [60] The pact contained a secret protocol, revealed only after Germany's defeat in 1945, according to which the states of Northern and Eastern Europe were divided into German and Soviet \"spheres of influence\" [61] In the north, Latvia, Finland and Estonia were assigned to the Soviet sphere [61] A week later, on 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland; on 17 September, the Soviet Union invaded Poland as well [62]: 32 \n\n\nSoviet era (1940–1941, 1944–1991)\nIn 1944, when Soviet military advances reached Latvia, heavy fighting took place in Latvia between German and Soviet troops, which ended in another German defeat In the course of the war, both occupying forces conscripted Latvians into their armies, in this way increasing the loss of the nation's \"live resources\" In 1944, part of the Latvian territory once more came under Soviet control The Soviets immediately began to reinstate the Soviet system After the German surrender, it became clear that Soviet forces were there to stay, and Latvian national partisans, soon joined by some who had collaborated with the Germans, began to fight against the new occupier [73]\n\n\nRestoration of independence in 1991\nIn the second half of the 1980s, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev started to introduce political and economic reforms in the Soviet Union that were called glasnost and perestroika In the summer of 1987, the first large demonstrations were held in Riga at the Freedom Monument—a symbol of independence In the summer of 1988, a national movement, coalescing in the Popular Front of Latvia, was opposed by the Interfront The Latvian SSR, along with the other Baltic Republics was allowed greater autonomy, and in 1988, the old pre-war Flag of Latvia flew again, replacing the Soviet Latvian flag as the official flag in 1990 [85] [86]\n\n\nSince joining the EU in 2004\nThe major goals of Latvia in the 1990s, to join NATO and the European Union, were achieved in 2004 The NATO Summit 2006 was held in Riga [90] Vaira Vīķe-Freiberga was President of Latvia from 1999 until 2007 She was the first female head of state in the former Soviet block state and was active in Latvia joining both NATO and the European Union in 2004 [91] Latvia signed the Schengen agreement on 16 April 2003 and started its implementation on 21 December 2007 [92]\n\n\nGeography\nLatvia lies in Northern Europe, on the eastern shores of the Baltic Sea and northwestern part of the East European Craton (EEC), between latitudes 55° and 58° N (a small area is north of 58°), and longitudes 21° and 29° E (a small area is west of 21°) Latvia has a total area of 64,559 km2 (24,926 sq mi) of which 62,157 km2 (23,999 sq mi) land, 18,159 km2 (7,011 sq mi)

typical Latvian landscape, a mosaic of vast forests alternates with fields, farmsteads, and pastures Arable land is spotted with birch groves and wooded clusters, which afford a habitat for numerous plants and animals Latvia has hundreds of kilometres of undeveloped seashore—lined by pine forests, dunes, and continuous white sand beaches [108] [116]\n\n\nBiodiversity\nApproximately 30,000 species of flora and fauna have been registered in Latvia [125] Larger mammalian wildlife in Latvia include deer, wild boar, moose, lynx, bear, fox, beaver and wolves [126] Non-marine molluscs of Latvia include 170 species [127]\n\n\nPolitics\nThe 100-seat unicameral Latvian parliament, the Saeima, is elected by direct popular vote every four years The president is elected by the Saeima in a separate election, also held every four years The president appoints a prime minister who, together with his cabinet, forms the executive branch of the government, which has to receive a confidence vote by the Saeima This system also existed before World War II [132] The most senior civil servants are the thirteen Secretaries of State [133]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nLatvia is a unitary state, currently divided into 43 local government units consisting of 36 municipalities (Latvian: novadi) and 7 state cities (Latvian: valstspilsētas) with their own city council and administration: Daugavpils, Jelgava, Jūrmala, Liepāja, Rēzekne, Riga, and Ventspils There are four historical and cultural regions in Latvia – Courland, Latgale, Vidzeme, Zemgale, which are recognised in Constitution of Latvia Selonia, a part of Zemgale, is sometimes considered culturally distinct region, but it is not part of any formal division The borders of historical and cultural regions usually are not explicitly defined and in several sources may vary In formal divisions, Riga region, which includes the capital and parts of other regions that have a strong relationship with the capital, is also often included in regional divisions; e.g., there are five planning regions of Latvia (Latvian: plānošanas reģioni), which were created in 2009 to promote balanced development of all regions Under this division Riga region includes large parts of what traditionally is considered Vidzeme, Courland, and Zemgale Statistical regions of Latvia, established in accordance with the EU Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics, duplicate this division, but divides Riga region into two parts with the capital alone being a separate region [citation needed]\nThe largest city in Latvia is Riga, the second largest city is Daugavpils and the third largest city is Liepaja.\n\n\nPolitical culture\nIn 2010 parliamentary election ruling centre-right coalition won 63 out of 100 parliamentary seats Left-wing opposition Harmony Centre supported by Latvia's Russian-speaking minority got 29 seats [134] In November 2013, Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis, in office since 2009, resigned after at least

stations of different scale have been built in Latvia [222] In 2022, the Latvian Prime Minister announced about the planned investments of 1 billion euros in the new wind farms and the completed project will expectedly provide additional 800 MW of capacity [223]\n\n\nDemographics\nThe total fertility rate (TFR) in 2018 was estimated to be 1.61 children born/woman, which is lower than the replacement rate of 2.1 In 2012, 45.0% of births were to unmarried women [225] The life expectancy in 2013 was estimated at 73.2 years (68.1 years male, 78.5 years female) [206] As of 2015, Latvia is

The country has a total area of approximately 64,559 square kilometers, with a population of around 1.9 million people. Latvia shares its borders with Estonia to the north, Lithuania to the south, Belarus to the southeast, and Russia to the east.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe name \"Latvia\" is derived from the name of the ancient Latgalians, one of four Indo-European Baltic tribes (along with Curonians, Selonians, and Semigallians), which formed the ethnic core of modern Latvians together with the Finnic Livonians. Henry of Latvia coined the Latinisations of the country's name, \"Lettigallia\" and \"Lethia\", both derived from the Latgalians. The terms inspired the variations on the country's name in Romance languages from \"Letonia\" and in several Germanic languages from \"Lettland\".\n\n**History**\n\nAround 3000 BC, the Proto-Baltic ancestors of the Latvian people settled on the eastern coast of the Baltic Sea. The Balts established trade routes to Rome and Byzantium, trading local amber for precious metals. By 900 AD, four distinct Baltic tribes inhabited Latvia: Curonians, Latgalians, Selonians, and Semigallians (in Latvian: kurši, latgaļi, sēļi, and zemgaļi), as well as the Finnic tribe of Livonians (lībieši) speaking a Finnic language.\n\n**Medieval Period**\n\nAlthough the local people had contact with the outside world for centuries, they became more fully integrated into the European socio-political system in the 12th century. The first missionaries, sent by the Pope, sailed up the Daugava River in the late 12th century, seeking converts. The local people, however, did not convert to Christianity as readily as the Church had hoped.\n\n**Reformation Period and Polish and Swedish Rule**\n\nAfter the Livonian War (1558–1583), Livonia (Northern Latvia & Southern Estonia) fell under Polish and Lithuanian rule. The southern part of Estonia and the northern part of Latvia were ceded to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and formed into the Duchy of Livonia (Ducatus Livoniae Ultradunensis). Gotthard Kettler, the last Master of the Order of Livonia, formed the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia. Although the duchy was a vassal state to the Lithuanian Grand Duchy and later of the Polish and Lithuanian commonwealth, it retained a considerable degree of autonomy and experienced a golden age in the 16th century.\n\n**Livonia & Courland in the Russian Empire (1795–1917)**\n\nDuring the Great Northern War (1700–1721), up to 40 percent of Latvians died from famine and plague. Half the residents of Riga were killed by plague in 1710–1711. The capitulation of Estonia and Livonia in 1710 and the Treaty of Nystad, ending the Great Northern War in 1721, gave Vidzeme to Russia. The Latgale region remained part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth as Inflanty Voivodeship until 1772, when it was incorporated into Russia. The Duchy of Courland and Semigallia, a vassal state of the Polish and Lithuanian commonwealth, was annexed by Russia in 1795 in the Third Partition of Poland, bringing all of what is now Latvia into the Russian Empire.\n\n**National Awakening**\n\nDuring the 19th century, the social structure changed dramatically. A class of independent farmers established itself after reforms allowed the peasants to repurchase their land, but many landless peasants remained. Latvians left for the cities and sought education, industrial jobs. The Young Latvian (Latvian: Jaunlatvieši) movement laid the groundwork for nationalism from the middle of the century, many of its leaders looking to the Slavophiles for support against the prevailing German-dominated social order. The rise in use of the Latvian language in literature and society became known as the First National Awakening.\n\n**Soviet Era (1940–1941, 1944–1991)**\n\nIn 1944, when Soviet military advances reached Latvia, heavy fighting took place in Latvia between German and Soviet troops, which ended in another German defeat. In the course of the war, both occupying forces conscripted Latvians into their armies, increasing the loss of the nation's \"live resources\". In 1944, part of the Latvian territory once more came under Soviet control. The Soviets immediately began to reinstate the Soviet system. After the German surrender, it became clear that Soviet forces were there to stay, and Latvian national partisans, soon joined by some who had collaborated with the Germans, began to fight against the new occupier.\n\n**Restoration of Independence in 1991**\n\nIn the second half of the 1980s, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev started to introduce political and economic reforms in the Soviet Union, known as glasnost and perestroika. In the summer of 1987, the first large demonstrations were held in Riga at the Freedom Monument—a symbol of independence. In the summer of 1988, a national movement, coalescing in the Popular Front of Latvia, was opposed by the Interfront. The Latvian SSR, along with the other Baltic Republics, was allowed greater autonomy, and in 1988, the old pre-war Flag of Latvia flew again, replacing the Soviet Latvian flag as the official flag in 1990.\n\n**Since Joining the EU in 2004**\n\nThe major goals of Latvia in the 1990s, to join NATO and the European Union, were achieved in 2004. The NATO Summit 2006 was held in Riga. Vaira Vīķe-Freiberga was President of Latvia from 1999 until 2007. She was the first female head of state in the former Soviet block state and was active in Latvia joining both NATO and the European Union in 2004. Latvia signed the Schengen agreement on 16 April 2003 and started its implementation on 21 December 2007.\n\n**Geography**\n\nLatvia lies in Northern Europe, on the eastern shores of the Baltic Sea and northwestern part of the East European Craton (EEC), between latitudes 55° and 58° N (a small area is north of 58°), and longitudes 21° and 29° E (a small area is west of 21°).

The climate is influenced by the Baltic Sea and the prevailing westerly winds from the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n**Environment**\n\nMost of Latvia is composed of fertile lowland plains and moderate hills. A typical Latvian landscape is a mosaic of vast forests alternating with fields, farmsteads, and pastures. Arable land is spotted with birch groves and wooded clusters, which afford a habitat for numerous plants and animals. Latvia has hundreds of kilometers of undeveloped seashore—lined by pine forests, dunes, and continuous white sand beaches.\n\n**Biodiversity**\n\nApproximately 30,000 species of flora and fauna have been registered in Latvia. Larger mammalian wildlife in Latvia includes deer, wild boar, moose, lynx, bear, fox, beaver, and wolves.

The president is elected by the Saeima in a separate election, also held every four years. The president appoints a prime minister who, together with his cabinet, forms the executive branch of the government, which has to receive a confidence vote by the Saeima. This system also existed before World War II.\n\n**Administrative Divisions**\n\nLatvia is a unitary state, currently divided into 43 local government units consisting of 36 municipalities (Latvian: novadi) and 7 state cities (Latvian: valstspilsētas) with their own city council and administration: Daugavpils, Jelgava, Jūrmala, Liepāja, Rēzekne, Riga, and Ventspils.\n\n**Political Culture**\n\nIn 2010 parliamentary election, the ruling centre-right coalition won 63 out of 100 parliamentary seats. The left-wing opposition Harmony Centre, supported by Latvia's Russian-speaking minority, got 29 seats.\n\n**Foreign Relations**\n\nLatvia is a member of the United Nations, European Union, Council of Europe, NATO, OECD, OSCE, IMF, and WTO.

Latvia's defense concept is based upon the Swedish-Finnish model of a rapid response force composed of a mobilization base and a small group of career professionals. From 1 January 2007, Latvia switched to a professional fully contract-based army.\n\n**Human Rights**\n\nAccording to the reports by Freedom House and the US Department of State, human rights in Latvia are generally respected by the government. Latvia is ranked above-average among the world's sovereign states in democracy, press freedom, privacy, and human development.\n\n**Economy**\n\nLatvia is a member of the World Trade Organization (1999) and the European Union (2004). On 1 January 2014, the euro became the country's currency, superseding the Lats. According to statistics in late 2013, 45% of the population supported the introduction of the euro, while 52% opposed it.\n\n**Infrastructure**\n\nThe transport sector is around 14% of GDP. Transit between Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and other Asian countries and the West used to be large.\n\n**Transport**\n\nThe transport sector is around 14% of GDP. Transit between Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and other Asian countries and the West used to be large.\n\n**Energy**\n\nLatvia has three large hydroelectric power stations in Pļaviņu HES (908 MW), Rīgas HES (402 MW), and Ķeguma HES-2 (248 MW). In recent years, a couple of dozen wind farms and biogas or biomass power stations of different scales have been built in Latvia. In 2022, the Latvian Prime Minister announced about the planned investments of 1 billion euros in the new wind farms and the completed project will expect to provide an additional 800 MW of capacity.\n\n**Demographics**\n\nThe total fertility rate (TFR) in 2018 was estimated to be 1.61 children born/woman, which is lower than the replacement rate of 2.1. In 2012, 45.0% of births were to unmarried women. The life expectancy in 2013 was estimated at 73.2 years (68.1 years male, 78.5 years female). As of 2015, Latvia is estimated to have the lowest male-to-female ratio in the world, at 0.85 males per female. In 2017, there were 1,054,433 females and 895,683 males living in Latvian territory.\n\n**Ethnic Groups**\n\nIn 2023, Latvians formed about 62.4% of the population, while 23.7% were Russians, Belarusians 3%, Ukrainians 3%, Poles 2%, Lithuanians 1%.\n\n**Language**\n\nThe sole official language of Latvia is Latvian, which belongs to the Baltic language sub-group of the Balto-Slavic branch of the Indo-European language family. Another notable language of Latvia is the nearly extinct Livonian language of the Finnic branch of the Uralic language family, which enjoys protection by law. Latgalian—a dialect of Latvian—is also protected by Latvian law but as a historical variation of the Latvian language.\n\n**Religion**\n\nThe largest religion in Latvia is Christianity (79%).

Other important universities include the Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies and Riga Stradiņš University.\n\n**Health**\n\nThe Latvian healthcare system is a universal programme, largely funded through government taxation. It is among the lowest-ranked healthcare systems in Europe, due to excessive waiting times for treatment, insufficient access to the latest medicines, and other factors.\n\n**Culture**\n\nTraditional Latvian folklore, especially the dance of the folk songs, dates back well over a thousand years. More than 1.2 million texts and 30,000 melodies of folk songs have been identified.\n\n**Cuisine**\n\nLatvian cuisine typically consists of agricultural products, with meat featuring in most main meal dishes. Fish is commonly consumed due to Latvia's location on the Baltic Sea. Latvian cuisine has been influenced by neighboring countries. Common ingredients in Latvian recipes are found locally, such as potatoes, wheat, barley, cabbage, onions, eggs, and pork.\n\n**Sport**\n\nIce hockey is usually considered the most popular sport in Latvia. Latvia has had many famous hockey stars like Helmuts Balderis, Artūrs Irbe, Kārlis Skrastiņš, and Sandis Ozoliņš, and more recently Zemgus Girgensons, whom the Latvian people have strongly supported in international and NHL play, expressed through the dedication of using the NHL's All-Star Voting to bring Zemgus to number one in voting.

movement, in the 1890s [52] Popular discontent exploded in the 1905 Russian Revolution, which took a nationalist character in the Baltic provinces [53]\n\n\nDeclaration of independence and interwar period\nWorld War I devastated the territory of what became the state of Latvia, and other western parts of the Russian Empire Demands for self-determination were initially confined to autonomy, until

commemorating the adoption of the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776. The Declaration announced the 13 American colonies' separation from Great Britain and established the United States of America as a sovereign nation. The holiday has become an important celebration of American history, freedom, and patriotism.\n\n**Background**\n\nDuring the American Revolution, the legal separation of the 13 colonies from Great Britain in 1776 actually occurred on July 2, when the Second Continental Congress voted to approve a resolution of independence proposed by Richard Henry Lee of Virginia. After voting for independence, Congress turned its attention to the Declaration of Independence, a statement explaining this decision.\n\nThe Committee of Five, consisting of Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Robert Livingston, and Roger Sherman, was tasked with drafting the Declaration. Thomas Jefferson, a young and talented writer, was entrusted with the responsibility of authoring the first draft of the document. The Declaration, with its eloquent language and philosophical ideas, declared the 13 colonies' independence from Great Britain and established the principles of equality, liberty, and democracy upon which the United States would be founded.\n\n**Observance**\n\nIndependence Day is a national holiday marked by patriotic displays and celebrations across the United States. Per 5 U.S.C. § 6103, Independence Day is a federal holiday, so all non-essential federal institutions, such as the postal service and federal courts, are closed on that day. While the legal holiday remains on July 4, if that date happens to be on a Saturday or Sunday, then federal government employees will instead take the day off on the adjacent Friday or Monday, respectively. Other non-essential businesses may also be closed on that day.\n\nThe day is marked by parades, fireworks, barbecues, and other patriotic events. Americans come together to celebrate their independence, freedom, and the values that have made the United States a beacon of hope and opportunity for the world.\n\n**Customs**\n\nIndependence Day is a time for Americans to reflect on their history, their values, and their national identity. The day is marked by a range of customs and traditions that reflect the diversity and richness of American culture.\n\nFrom the singing of patriotic songs, such as \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" and \"America the Beautiful,\" to the recitation of the Declaration of Independence and the Pledge of Allegiance, Americans come together to celebrate their shared heritage.\n\nThe day is also marked by a range of cultural and culinary traditions, from the traditional American barbecue to the baking of patriotic-themed cookies and cakes. Americans also come together to watch baseball games, fireworks displays, and other patriotic events.\n\n**Celebration Gallery**\n\nThe Philippines celebrates July 4 as its Republic Day to commemorate the day in 1946 when it ceased to be a U.S. territory and the United States officially recognized Philippine Independence.

{"title": "Henry_VII_of_England", "content": "\nAncestry and early life\nHenry VII was born on 28 January 1457 at Pembroke Castle, in the English-speaking portion of Pembrokeshire known as Little England beyond Wales He was the only child of Lady Margaret Beaufort, who was 13 years old at the time, and Edmund Tudor, 1st Earl of Richmond who, at 26, died three months before his birth [1] He was probably baptised at St Mary's Church, Pembroke, [2] though no documentation of the event exists [3] Henry's paternal grandfather, Owen Tudor, originally from the Tudors of Penmynydd, Isle of Anglesey in Wales, had been a page in the court of King Henry V He rose to become one of the \"Squires to the Body to the King\" after military service at the Battle of Agincourt [4] Owen is said to have secretly married the widow of Henry V, Catherine of Valois One of their sons was Edmund, Henry's father Edmund was created Earl of Richmond in 1452, and \"formally declared legitimate by Parliament\" [5]\n\n\nRise to the throne\nBy 1483, Henry's mother was actively promoting him as an alternative to Richard III, despite her being married to Lord Stanley, a Yorkist At Rennes Cathedral on Christmas Day 1483, Henry pledged to marry Elizabeth of York, the eldest daughter of Edward IV She was Edward's heir since the presumed death of her brothers, the Princes in the Tower, King Edward V and Richard of Shrewsbury, Duke of York [16] With money and supplies borrowed from his host, Francis II of Brittany, Henry tried to land in England, but his conspiracy unravelled resulting in the execution of his primary co-conspirator, Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham [17] Now supported by Francis II's prime minister, Pierre Landais, Richard III attempted to extradite Henry from Brittany, but Henry escaped to France [18] He was welcomed by the French, who readily supplied him with troops and equipment for a second invasion [citation needed]\nHenry gained the support of the Woodvilles, in-laws of the late Edward IV, and sailed with a small French and Scottish force, landing at Mill Bay near Dale, Pembrokeshire [19] He marched toward England accompanied by his uncle Jasper and John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford Wales was historically a Lancastrian stronghold, and Henry owed the support he gathered to his Welsh birth and ancestry, being agnatically descended from Rhys ap Gruffydd [20] He amassed an army of about 5,000–6,000 soldiers [21]\n\n\nReign\nTo secure his hold on the throne, Henry declared himself king by right of conquest retroactively from 21 August 1485, the day before Bosworth Field [22] Thus, anyone who had fought for Richard against him would be guilty of treason and Henry could legally confiscate the lands and property of Richard III, while restoring his own Henry spared Richard's nephew and designated heir, John de la Pole, Earl of Lincoln, and made the Yorkist heiress Margaret Plantagenet Countess of Salisbury suo jure He took care not to address the baronage or summon Parliament until after his coronation, which took place in Westminster Abbey on 30 October 1485 [23] After his coronation Henry issued an edict that any gentleman who swore fealty to him would, notwithstanding any previous attainder, be secure in his property and person [citation needed]\n\n\nEconomics\nFor most of Henry VII's reign Edward Story was Bishop of Chichester Story's register still exists and, according to the 19th-century historian W.R.W Stephens, \"affords some illustrations of the avaricious and parsimonious character of the king\" It seems that Henry was skilful at extracting money from his subjects on many pretexts, including that of war with France or war with Scotland The money so extracted added to the King's personal fortune rather than being used for the stated purpose [37]\n\n\nForeign policy\nHenry VII's policy was to maintain peace and to create economic prosperity Up to a point, he succeeded The Treaty of Redon was signed in February 1489 between Henry and representatives of Brittany Based on the terms of the accord, Henry sent 6,000 troops to fight (at the expense of Brittany) under the command of Lord Daubeney The purpose of the agreement was to prevent France from annexing Brittany According to John M Currin, the treaty redefined Anglo-Breton relations Henry started a new policy to recover Guyenne and other lost Plantagenet claims in France The treaty marks a shift from neutrality over the French invasion of Brittany to active intervention against it [47]\n\n\nTrade agreements\nHenry VII was much enriched by trading alum, which was used in the wool and cloth trades as a chemical fixative for dyeing fabrics [54] Since alum was mined in only one area in Europe (Tolfa, Italy), it was a scarce commodity and therefore especially valuable to its landholder, the Pope With the English economy heavily invested in wool production, Henry VII became involved in the alum trade in 1486 With the assistance of the Italian merchant banker Lodovico della Fava and the Italian banker Girolamo Frescobaldi, Henry VII became deeply involved in the trade by licensing ships, obtaining alum from the Ottoman Empire, and selling it to the Low Countries and in England [55] This trade made an expensive commodity cheaper, which raised opposition from Pope Julius II, since the Tolfa mine was a part of papal territory and had given the Pope monopoly control over alum [citation needed]\n\n\nLaw enforcement and justices of the peace\nHenry's principal problem was to restore royal authority in a realm recovering from the Wars of the Roses There were too many powerful noblemen and, as a consequence of the system of so-called bastard feudalism, each had what amounted to private armies of indentured retainers (mercenaries masquerading as servants) [58] Following the example of Edward IV, Henry VII created a Council of Wales and the Marches for his son Arthur, which was intended to govern Wales and the Marches, Cheshire and Cornwall [59] [60] [61]\n\n\nLater years and death\nIn 1502, Henry VII's life took a difficult and personal turn in which many people he was close to died in quick succession His first son and heir apparent, Arthur, Prince of Wales, died suddenly at Ludlow Castle, very likely from a viral respiratory illness known at the time as the \"English sweating sickness\" [65] This made Henry VII's second son, Henry, Duke of York, heir apparent to the throne The King, normally a reserved man who rarely showed much emotion in public unless angry, surprised his courtiers with his intense grief and sobbing at his son's death His concern for the Queen is evidence that the marriage was a happy one, as is his reaction to Queen Elizabeth's death the following year, when he shut himself away for several days, refusing to speak to anyone [66] Henry VII was shattered by the loss of Elizabeth, and her death affected him severely [67]\n\n\nAppearance and character\nAmiable and high-spirited, Henry was friendly if dignified in manner, and it was clear that he was extremely intelligent His biographer, Professor Stanley Chrimes, credits him – even before he had become king – with \"a high degree of personal magnetism, ability to inspire confidence, and a growing reputation for shrewd decisiveness\" On the debit side, he may have looked a little delicate as he suffered from poor health [25] [81]\n\n\nComparison with contemporaries\nHistorians have compared Henry VII with his continental contemporaries, especially Louis XI of France and Ferdinand II of Aragon By 1600 historians emphasised Henry's wisdom in drawing lessons in statecraft from other monarchs In 1622 Francis Bacon published his History of the Reign of King Henry VII By 1900 the \"New Monarchy\" interpretation stressed the common factors that in each country led to the revival of monarchical power This approach raised puzzling questions about similarities and differences in the development of national states In the late 20th century a model of European state formation was prominent in which Henry less resembles Louis and Ferdinand [82]\n\n\nFamily\nHenry VII and Elizabeth had seven children:

VII was the first Tudor king of England, reigning from 1485 to 1509. He was a member of the House of Tudor and is known for his role in ending the Plantagenet dynasty, which had ruled England for over 300 years.

Catherine Tudor (1503-1503)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Henry_VII_of_England\" following this outline:\n\n\nAncestry and early life\nHenry VII was born on 28 January 1457 at Pembroke Castle, in the English-speaking portion of Pembrokeshire known as Little England beyond Wales He was the only child of Lady Margaret Beaufort, who was 13 years old at the time, and Edmund Tudor, 1st Earl of Richmond who, at 26, died three months before his birth [1] He was probably baptised at St Mary's Church, Pembroke, [2] though no documentation of the event exists [3] Henry's paternal grandfather, Owen Tudor, originally from the Tudors of Penmynydd, Isle of Anglesey in Wales, had been a page in the court of King Henry V He rose to become one of the \"Squires to the Body to the King\" after military service at the Battle of Agincourt [4] Owen is said to have secretly married the widow of Henry V, Catherine of Valois One of their sons was Edmund, Henry's father Edmund was created Earl of Richmond in 1452, and \"formally declared legitimate by Parliament\" [5]\n\n\nRise to the throne\nBy 1483, Henry's mother was actively promoting him as an alternative to Richard III, despite her being married to Lord Stanley, a Yorkist At Rennes Cathedral on Christmas Day 1483, Henry pledged to marry Elizabeth of York, the eldest daughter of Edward IV She was Edward's heir since the presumed death of her brothers, the Princes in the Tower, King Edward V and Richard of Shrewsbury, Duke of York [16] With money and supplies borrowed from his host, Francis II of Brittany, Henry tried to land in England, but his conspiracy unravelled resulting in the execution of his primary co-conspirator, Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham [17] Now supported by Francis II's prime minister, Pierre Landais, Richard III attempted to extradite Henry from Brittany, but Henry escaped to France [18] He was welcomed by the French, who readily supplied him with troops and equipment for a second invasion [citation needed]\nHenry gained the support of the Woodvilles, in-laws of the late Edward IV, and sailed with a small French and Scottish force, landing at Mill Bay near Dale, Pembrokeshire [19] He marched toward England accompanied by his uncle Jasper and John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford Wales was historically a Lancastrian stronghold, and Henry owed the support he gathered to his Welsh birth and ancestry, being agnatically descended from Rhys ap Gruffydd [20] He amassed an army of about 5,000–6,000 soldiers [21]\n\n\nReign\nTo secure his hold on the throne, Henry declared himself king by right of conquest retroactively from 21 August 1485, the day before Bosworth Field [22] Thus, anyone who had fought for Richard against him would be guilty of treason and Henry could legally confiscate the lands and property of Richard III, while restoring his own Henry spared Richard's nephew and designated heir, John de la Pole, Earl of Lincoln, and made the Yorkist heiress Margaret Plantagenet Countess of Salisbury suo jure He took care not to address the baronage or summon Parliament until after his coronation, which took place in Westminster Abbey on 30 October 1485 [23] After his coronation Henry issued an edict that any gentleman who swore fealty to him would, notwithstanding any previous attainder, be secure in his property and person [citation needed]\n\n\nEconomics\nFor most of Henry VII's reign Edward Story was Bishop of Chichester Story's register still exists and, according to the 19th-century historian W.R.W Stephens, \"affords some illustrations of the avaricious and parsimonious character of the king\" It seems that Henry was skilful at extracting money from his subjects on many pretexts, including that of war with France or war with Scotland The money so extracted added to the King's personal fortune rather than being used for the stated purpose [37]\n\n\nForeign policy\nHenry VII's policy was to maintain peace and to create economic prosperity Up to a point, he succeeded The Treaty of Redon was signed in February 1489 between Henry and representatives of Brittany Based on the terms of the accord, Henry sent 6,000 troops to fight (at the expense of Brittany) under the command of Lord Daubeney The purpose of the agreement was to prevent France from annexing Brittany According to John M Currin, the treaty redefined Anglo-Breton relations Henry started a new policy to recover Guyenne and other lost Plantagenet claims in France The treaty marks a shift from neutrality over the French invasion of Brittany to active intervention against it [47]\n\n\nTrade agreements\nHenry VII was much enriched by trading alum, which was used in the wool and cloth trades as a chemical fixative for dyeing fabrics [54] Since alum was mined in only one area in Europe (Tolfa, Italy), it was a scarce commodity and therefore especially valuable to its landholder, the Pope With the English economy heavily invested in wool production, Henry VII became involved in the alum trade in 1486 With the assistance of the Italian merchant banker Lodovico della Fava and the Italian banker Girolamo Frescobaldi, Henry VII became deeply involved in the trade by licensing ships, obtaining alum from the Ottoman Empire, and selling it to the Low Countries and in England [55] This trade made an expensive commodity cheaper, which raised opposition from Pope Julius II, since the Tolfa mine was a part of papal territory and had given the Pope monopoly control over alum [citation needed]\n\n\nLaw enforcement and justices of the peace\nHenry's principal problem was to restore royal authority in a realm recovering from the Wars of the Roses There were too many powerful noblemen and, as a consequence of the system of so-called bastard feudalism, each had what amounted to private armies of indentured retainers (mercenaries masquerading as servants) [58] Following the example of Edward IV, Henry VII created a Council of Wales and the Marches for his son Arthur, which was intended to govern Wales and the Marches, Cheshire and Cornwall [59] [60] [61]\n\n\nLater years and death\nIn 1502, Henry VII's life took a difficult and personal turn in which many people he was close to died in quick succession His first son and heir apparent, Arthur, Prince of Wales, died suddenly at Ludlow Castle, very likely from a viral respiratory illness known at the time as the \"English sweating sickness\" [65] This made Henry VII's second son, Henry, Duke of York, heir apparent to the throne The King, normally a reserved man who rarely showed much emotion in public unless angry, surprised his courtiers with his intense grief and sobbing at his son's death His concern for the Queen is evidence that the marriage was a happy one, as is his reaction to Queen Elizabeth's death the following year, when he shut himself away for several days, refusing to speak to anyone [66] Henry VII was shattered by the loss of Elizabeth, and her death affected him severely [67]\n\n\nAppearance and character\nAmiable and high-spirited, Henry was friendly if dignified in manner, and it was clear that he was extremely intelligent His biographer, Professor Stanley Chrimes, credits him – even before he had become king – with \"a high degree of personal magnetism, ability to inspire confidence, and a growing reputation for shrewd decisiveness\" On the debit side, he may have looked a little delicate as he suffered from poor health [25] [81]\n\n\nComparison with contemporaries\nHistorians have compared Henry VII with his continental contemporaries, especially Louis XI of France and Ferdinand II of Aragon By 1600 historians emphasised Henry's wisdom in drawing lessons in statecraft from other monarchs In 1622 Francis Bacon published his History of the Reign of King Henry VII By 1900 the \"New Monarchy\" interpretation stressed the common factors that in each country led to the revival of

[95] The Washington Post ranked him a top 15 contender [96] On December 4, 2018, Avenatti announced that he would not be a candidate for president of the United States in 2020 In a Twitter post, he announced, \"I do not make this decision lightly – I make it out of respect for my family.\" [97]\n\n\nArrests and charges\nIn November 2018, Avenatti was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence [98] The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) later confirmed Avenatti was arrested for felony domestic violence and his bail was set at $50,000 [99] [100] An LAPD spokesperson said that the unidentified victim, at the time, later described as his girlfriend, [101] had \"visible injuries\" and that the case would be referred to the Los Angeles County District Attorney for prosecution [102] Minutes after the reports of Avenatti's arrest, the Twitter account of Surefire Intelligence, a company created by Jacob Wohl, [103] [104] seemingly claimed responsibility for the arrest, tweeting a news story about it and adding \"Surefire Intelligence strikes again.\" [105]\n\n\nDomestic violence complaint but not charged\nIn November 2018, Avenatti was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence [98] The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) later confirmed Avenatti was arrested for felony domestic violence and his bail was set at $50,000 [99] [100] An LAPD spokesperson said that the unidentified victim, at the time, later described as his girlfriend, [101] had \"visible injuries\" and that the case would be referred to the Los Angeles County District Attorney for prosecution [102] Minutes after the reports of Avenatti's arrest, the Twitter account of Surefire Intelligence, a company created by Jacob Wohl, [103] [104] seemingly claimed responsibility for the arrest, tweeting a news story about it and adding \"Surefire Intelligence strikes again.\" [105]\n\n\nExtortion conviction and sentencing\nAvenatti's settlement offers in his suit against Nike became so overly aggressive that the prosecutors of his case contended that he was engaging in extortion [110] Nike had agreed to pay a coach damages to settle a case; however, Avenatti concealed this from the coach because Nike's offer didn't include attorney's fees [111]\n\n\nFraud and embezzlement conviction and sentencing\nAlso, on March 25, 2019, the U.S Attorney for the Central District of California, Nicola T Hanna, announced in Los Angeles the filing of a 197-page complaint accusing Avenatti of wire fraud and bank fraud [76] The indictment said that Avenatti had embezzled money from a client and had defrauded a Mississippi bank by submitting false tax returns to obtain more than $4 million in loans Prosecutors also alleged that Avenatti had not filed personal tax returns for the years in question [117]\n\n\nTheft of book proceeds from Stormy Daniels\nOn May 22, 2019, Avenatti was charged with wire fraud and aggravated identity theft as a result of allegations that he stole money from former client Stormy Daniels while helping negotiate her 2018 book deal [125] [126] Avenatti pleaded not guilty Avenatti was released on a $300,000 bail bond on the conditions that he notify authorities of any travel plans and that he have no contact with Daniels [126]\n\n\nState Bar proceeding in California\nOn June 5, 2019, the State Bar of California filed with the California State Bar Court a 573-page application under the California Business and Professions Code section 6007(c)(2), to involuntarily enroll Avenatti as an inactive member of the bar [53] The State Bar Court is the court that decides whether a California attorney committed professional misconduct worthy of discipline, up to and including disbarment The State Bar contends that the evidence submitted with the petition establishes that Avenatti has committed professional misconduct that has caused or is causing substantial harm to Avenatti's clients or the public There is a substantial probability that Avenatti's professional misconduct will result in his disbarment If the State Bar Court finds sufficient evidence to place Avenatti on involuntary inactive enrollment, the State Bar must initiate disciplinary proceedings within 45 days of the effective date of the order If the State Bar Court rules on disbarment, the California Supreme Court must review and approve it [130]\n\n\nJanuary 2020 arrest\nAvenatti was again arrested on January 14, 2020, during a recess in court for his disbarment proceedings, for violating the terms of a previous release, and was expected to appear in federal court in Santa Ana, California, on January 15 [132]\n\n\nPersonal life\nAvenatti was married for 13 years to Christine Carlin, with whom he has two daughters [133] [102]\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Kellie Lewis, who finished in second place [173] [174] In October 2013, O'Riordan and Marco Mendoza reconvened their partnership and were working on the songs for her announced third solo album scheduled for 2014, and presumably some film possibilities [175] Her final performance at the Vatican Christmas concert occurred in December 2013, [80] where she performed \"Letting Go\" from Are You Listening?, \"Silent Night\" in duet with Elisa Toffoli, \"Away in a Manger\" and \"Happy Xmas (War Is Over)\" [81] [176] In the autumn of 2013, as her hometown of Limerick was preparing to start its

a melancholic strain in the works of the best pioneers, an undying obsession with death, and a primal need to capture the wondrous, the bizarre each time.\n\n\nVoice\nO'Riordan was a mezzo-soprano, with a vocal range from B 2 to C 6 [8] [99] [238] She did not sing much in the 5th octave but rather in a range of vocal comfort [239] She was familiar with the vocal belting of '90s alternative rock [99] and was also devoted to her love of falsetto [99] [240] [241] Her voice was rather light without applying an uncomfortable weight, and she characteristically deployed a soft projection when she sang the lowest notes [99] [242] O'Riordan's signature singing style integrated many elements, such as the lilting voice, [8] [243] mournful keening, [244] glottal ornamentation and a distinctive attack on syllables [183] Mikael Wood of Los Angeles Times commented, \"She had a high, airy tone that could turn ferocious without warning She emphasized its breaks and curls, decorating the catchy melodies she wrote with florid vocal runs inherited from Celtic tradition.\" [245] O'Riordan was also renowned for her yodeling techniques, embracing the sharp break of her voice [246] [247] [248] She had never compromised her strong Irish accent, even when she was criticized for that [247] [249] [250] Her singing was rooted in the Sean-nós vocal style; [246] the University of Limerick wrote, \"Dolores's voice carried strong traces of the Sean-nós (old style) Gaelic tradition of unaccompanied singing that so beautifully conveys sadness, regret and loneliness.\" [251] \"Íosa\", an outtake from the Cranberries' debut album, was the only song in which O'Riordan sang entirely in Irish-Gaelic, inspired by her path as a liturgical soloist [252] Around the age of 40, the timbre of her voice changed and became more mature [e] [156]\n\n\nVocal recordings\nNoel Hogan described how O'Riordan tended to \"layer a lot of harmonies, a lot of falsetto stuff\" as soon as she first entered the recording studio, Xeric Studios, at the beginning of 1990 [260] O'Riordan used a Neumann U 87 microphone for her vocal tracks, especially during the recording of the debut studio album Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We? [260] In an interview with Sound on Sound, in March 2019, Hogan and record producer Stephen Street described that \"spontaneity was the key\"; [f] Hogan said: \"she would like to do maybe three or four takes\" [260] Regarding backing vocals she would go through very quickly, he said: \"cause she had an amazing ear for tuning\", then she ended with her highest notes [260] She would add additional layers of vocal inflections over the existing main vocals as she went along [260] In South China Morning Post, Hogan described O'Riordan's voice during the recording of \"Linger\": We're all looking at each in the room going, 'where did that come out from?' because she was so small and tiny—you didn't expect that And then she only grew from that point on As the years went down, she just got better and better.\" [261]\n\n\nPersonal life\nOn 18 July 1994, O'Riordan married Canadian-born Don Burton, who was the former tour manager of Duran Duran [21] [265] They met in the U.S while Duran Duran and the Cranberries were on tour together [17] [30] The wedding was held at Holy Cross Abbey in County Tipperary [30] [79] The couple had three children [265] [266] O'Riordan had a stepson from Burton's previous relationship [265] [266] In 1996, they lived at The Coach House, a medieval-style residence beside Ballyhannon Castle at Quin in County Clare, Ireland [267] They lived in their first home for a year while they planned their own ultra-modern house, [267] including a recording studio and guest apartment, set on a 16-acre (6.5-hectare) plot in Dunquin, west County Kerry, on the Dingle Peninsula, but they spent little time there and later sold the property [268] [269]\n\n\nWealth\nIn 2006, she was one of the 10 richest women in Ireland, [298] and was reported to be the fifth-richest woman in 1999 [204] [299] In 2008, she was sixth on the list of the ten richest artists in Ireland;

[152]\n\n\n2013–2018: The Voice of Ireland and Something Else\nO'Riordan replaced Sharon Corr as one of the mentors on RTÉ's The Voice of Ireland during the 2013–14 season [171] [172] O'Riordan reached the final of the competition with her act Kellie Lewis, who finished in second place [173] [174] In October 2013, O'Riordan and Marco Mendoza reconvened their partnership and were working on the songs for her announced third solo album scheduled for 2014, and presumably some film possibilities [175] Her final performance at the Vatican Christmas concert occurred in December 2013, [80] where she performed \"Letting Go\" from Are You Listening?, \"Silent Night\" in duet with Elisa Toffoli, \"Away in a Manger\" and \"Happy Xmas (War Is Over)\" [81] [176] In the autumn of 2013, as her hometown of Limerick was preparing to start its tenure as Irish City of Culture in 2014, O'Riordan was approached by the city to play a special gig [177] During a New Year's Eve party under the Spire of St Mary's Cathedral, she performed with a quartet from the Irish Chamber Orchestra, playing \"Linger\", \"Zombie\" and one solo, \"The Journey\" [178]\n\n\nArtistry\nO'Riordan's deeply religious mother had a strong influence on her musical development, introducing her to Elvis Presley at an early age [195] [196] O'Riordan's Catholic education and experience playing the church organ also introduced her to classical church music genres such as Gregorian chant, which she described as having \"great melodies.\" [197] [18] [c] [196] [199] Months before she died, O'Riordan tested the resonance and the acoustics of the Glenstal Abbey church in Ireland to sing there [200] O'Riordan stated that this apprenticeship by this detachment of the world in a raw and devoted setting influenced a lot of her development as an artist and as a musician [66] [152]\n\n\nInfluences\nO'Riordan's deeply religious mother had a strong influence on her musical development, introducing her to

and musicianship\nTake any artistry and you'll find a melancholic strain in the works of the best pioneers, an undying obsession with death, and a primal need to capture the wondrous, the bizarre each time.\n\n\nVoice\nO'Riordan was a mezzo-soprano, with a vocal range from B 2 to C 6 [8] [99] [238] She did not sing much in the 5th octave but rather in a range of vocal comfort [239] She was familiar with the vocal belting of '90s alternative rock [99] and was also devoted to her love of falsetto [99] [240] [241] Her voice was rather light without applying an uncomfortable weight, and she characteristically deployed a soft projection when she sang the lowest notes [99] [242] O'Riordan's signature singing style integrated many elements, such as the lilting voice, [8] [243] mournful keening, [244] glottal ornamentation and a distinctive attack on syllables [183] Mikael Wood of Los Angeles Times commented, \"She had a high, airy tone that could turn ferocious without warning She emphasized its breaks and curls, decorating the catchy melodies she wrote with florid vocal runs inherited from Celtic tradition.\" [245] O'Riordan was also renowned for her yodeling techniques, embracing the sharp break of her voice [246] [247] [248] She had never compromised her strong Irish accent, even when she was criticized for that [247] [249] [250] Her singing was rooted in the Sean-nós vocal style; [246] the University of Limerick wrote, \"Dolores's voice carried strong traces of the Sean-nós (old style) Gaelic tradition of unaccompanied singing that so beautifully conveys sadness, regret and loneliness.\" [251] \"Íosa\", an outtake from the Cranberries' debut album, was the only song in which O'Riordan sang entirely in Irish-Gaelic, inspired by her path as a liturgical soloist [252] Around the age of 40, the timbre of her voice changed and became more mature [e] [156]\n\n\nVocal recordings\nNoel Hogan described how O'Riordan tended to \"layer a lot of harmonies, a lot of falsetto stuff\" as soon as she first entered the recording studio, Xeric Studios, at the beginning of 1990 [260] O'Riordan used a Neumann U 87 microphone for her vocal tracks, especially during the recording of the debut studio album Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We? [260] In an interview with Sound on Sound, in March 2019, Hogan and record producer Stephen Street described that \"spontaneity was the key\"; [f] Hogan said: \"she would like to do maybe three or four takes\" [260] Regarding backing vocals she would go through very quickly, he said: \"cause she had an amazing ear for tuning\", then she ended with her highest notes [260] She would add additional layers of vocal inflections over the existing main vocals as she went along [260] In South China Morning Post, Hogan described O'Riordan's voice during the recording of \"Linger\": We're all looking at each in the room going, 'where did that come out from?' because she was so small and tiny—you didn't expect that And then she only grew from that point on As the years went down, she just got better and better.\" [261]\n\n\nPersonal life\nOn 18 July 1994, O'Riordan married Canadian-born Don Burton, who was the former tour manager of Duran Duran [21] [265] They met in the U.S while Duran Duran and the Cranberries were on tour together [17] [30] The wedding was held at Holy Cross Abbey in County Tipperary [30] [79] The couple had three children [265] [266] O'Riordan had a stepson from Burton's previous relationship [265] [266] In 1996, they lived at The Coach House, a medieval-style residence beside Ballyhannon Castle at Quin in County Clare, Ireland [267] They lived in their first home for a year while they planned their own ultra-modern house, [267] including a recording studio and guest apartment, set on a 16-acre (6.5-hectare) plot in Dunquin, west County Kerry, on the Dingle Peninsula, but they spent little time there and later sold the property [268] [269]\n\n\nWealth\nIn 2006, she was one of the 10 richest women in Ireland, [298] and was reported to be the fifth-richest woman in 1999 [204] [299] In 2008, she was sixth on the list of the ten richest artists in Ireland; her net worth was $66 million [300]\n\n\nDeath\nOn 15 January 2018, O'Riordan was found unresponsive in the bathroom of her London hotel room, and was pronounced dead at 9:16 a.m She was 46 [301] [302] An inquest at Westminster Coroner's Court held on 6 September, [303] [304] ruled that she died as a result of accidental drowning in a bath following sedation by alcohol intoxication [303] [305] Empty bottles were found in O'Riordan's room (five miniature bottles and a champagne bottle) as well as some prescription drugs Toxicology tests showed that her body contained only \"therapeutic\" levels of these medications but a blood alcohol content of 330 mg/dL (0.33%) [303] [305]\n\n\nMemorial service\nOn 21 January 2018, O'Riordan's funeral opened three days of mourning in Ireland [312] Funeral plans included a service reserved for extended family and close friends [313] A three-day funeral in her hometown, with O'Riordan lying in repose, lasted from 20 to 22 January at St Joseph's Church In a tribute normally reserved for heads of State, thousands streamed past her open coffin, in a four-hour public reposing inside St Joseph's Church in the city [314] [315] O'Riordan, wearing dark eyeshadow, with raven hair, was laid out in an open coffin wearing black and holding a set of pearl rosary beads [315] [316] O'Riordan's songs were played, while photographs of the singer performing and one of her with Pope John Paul II were placed along the walls [308] [317] Friends left a floral tribute next to the coffin, which read: \"The song has ended, but the memories linger on\" [317] [318]\n\n\nRemembrances\nThe President of Ireland, Michael D Higgins, was one of the first to pay his respects [323] The Taoiseach of Ireland, Leo Varadkar, also paid his respects to O'Riordan [324]\nAlso, in recognition of O'Riordan's influence, the Avett Brothers covered the Cranberries song \"Linger\" [325] Bono and Johnny Depp performed a tribute for O'Riordan ending the performance on \"Linger\", at the National Concert Hall in Dublin, Ireland, just hours after the sudden death of O'Riordan [326] Bono, Sinéad O'Connor, Johnny Depp and Nick Cave gave Dolores O'Riordan a standing ovation at a birthday party for Shane MacGowan, singer of the Pogues [326] On the announcement of her death on 15 January 2018, O'Riordan appeared on the huge 360° screen overhanging the Madison Square Garden floor in New York City during a New York Rangers game A photo of this appearance was published on 17 January 2018 on Madison Square Garden's Facebook [327]\n\n\nRecognition\nThe President of Ireland, Michael D Higgins, was one of the first to pay his respects [323] The Taoiseach of Ireland, Leo Varadkar, also paid his respects to O'Riordan [324]\nAlso, in recognition of O'Riordan's influence, the Avett Brothers covered the Cranberries song \"Linger\" [325] Bono and Johnny Depp performed a tribute for O'Riordan ending the performance on \"Linger\", at the National Concert Hall in Dublin, Ireland, just hours after the sudden death of O'Riordan [326] Bono, Sinéad O'Connor, Johnny Depp and Nick Cave gave Dolores O'Riordan a standing ovation at a birthday party for Shane MacGowan, singer of the Pogues [326] On the announcement of her death on 15 January 2018, O'Riordan appeared on the huge 360° screen overhanging the Madison Square Garden floor in New York City during a New York Rangers game A photo of this appearance was published on 17 January 2018 on Madison Square Garden's Facebook [327]\n\n\nFurther reaction\nThe Kinks guitarist Dave Davies, a close friend of O'Riordan, had planned to collaborate on songs together before she died;

Schiff, writers for the series include Beau Willimon and Gilroy's brother Dan [6] [24] Gilroy urged his writing team to put aside their personal reverence and nostalgia for Star Wars, fearing that such an attitude could change their behavior and work [46] Gilroy wanted the series to be accessible to all viewers, not just Star Wars fans, with the hope that those fans would be able to watch the series with their friends and family who are not interested in the rest of the franchise [4] He had also wanted to ensure the series was grounded in reality and had identified the main \"navigational Star Wars piece of information\" as being the calendar During the first writers' room meeting, Gilroy had prepared a 100-page outline for the series, as he had already planned the structure of the series Willimon and Dan Gilroy were present, in addition to executive producer Sanne Wohlenberg and production designer Luke Hull, calling Hull his \"primary creative collaborator on the story\" They had discussed the story for five days [31] Luna expressed his excitement at being able to explore the character of Andor further in the series after making Rogue One, in which the character also appears [37]\n\n\nDesign\nLuke Hull served as production designer on the series, [55] and described it as \"very cinematic\" [37] Neal Scanlan provided the creature and droid effects after doing the same for all of Disney's Star Wars films, including Rogue One [56] He said his team was treating the series the same as they did the films, [37] and due to Gilroy's involvement the series would fit within the same \"pocket of  [Star Wars] history\" as Rogue One with a \"slightly harder edge\" than other Star Wars projects [56] Scanlan added that unused creatures developed for the films could be brought back for the series, [57] alongside newly created creatures [37] An outdoor city set, which co-star Adria Arjona estimated to be three to five city blocks long, was built practically for the series [58]\n\n\nCasting\nDiego Luna was confirmed to be reprising his role as Cassian Andor from Rogue One with the series' announcement in November 2018 [28] In April 2019, Alan Tudyk was announced

Rogue One and other Star Wars media [60] [6] Adria Arjona joined the cast in August 2020, [61] and Fiona Shaw was revealed to also be appearing in December, [36] when Tudyk was not included in an

Emms was cast in a supporting role in June 2021, [17] when Skarsgård revealed that Forest Whitaker was reprising his role as Saw Gerrera from Rogue One [15] In February 2022, David Hayman confirmed that he had a role in the series after being spotted by fans during filming [18] The first season has over 200 named cast members and over 6,000 extras [37]\n\n\nFilming\nFilming began in London, England, at the end of November 2020, [47] [63] with the production based at Pinewood Studios [64] [65] The series was filmed under the working title Pilgrim, [64] and was the first live-action Star Wars series to not make use of the StageCraft digital background technology This was done because the scripts were more suited to being filmed on locations and large sets, and Luna noted that taking a different filming approach for the series made it similar to Rogue One, whose filming style was distinct from other Star Wars films [66] Toby Haynes directed the first three episodes, [35] with Ben Caron, Susanna White, and Haynes each directing another \"block\" of three episodes [8] [39] Jonathan Freeman and Adriano Goldman served as cinematographers [41] [67] The series was previously reported to begin filming in 2019, [28] and then June 2020, [67] but was delayed multiple times due to the COVID-19 pandemic [34] Both UK and U.S COVID-19 protocols were followed on set, including daily temperature checks and tests for COVID-19 three times a week [65] Filming at Pinewood Studios was expected to end in July 2021 [65]\n\n\nMusic\nGilroy contacted Nicholas Britell about composing for the series in 2020, before filming began so he could compose source music that would be played on set Gilroy and Britell, who are neighbors in Manhattan, first met for the project in August 2020 Kennedy and Gilroy wanted the series to have a unique sound, and Britell said it would be \"orchestral-plus\" with a \"wide range of sounds\" including some that he had created He added that the large scope of the series meant that \"every episode has new demands, new music, and new ideas It's important that as the story evolves, the music should evolve too.\" [89] Britell was publicly revealed to be the series' composer in February 2022, [90] and was still working on it that May when he said they had been \"working nonstop for months, actually years, at this point\" Recording was underway by then at AIR Lyndhurst studios in London, with a full orchestra Britell was unable to travel to London due to the pandemic, but had a team in place there that also worked with him on other television series [89]\n\n\nMarketing\nA sizzle reel featuring behind-the-scenes footage of pre-production and filming was released during Disney's Investors Day presentation in December 2020, when the series' title and cast was officially announced by Kennedy [36] [37] Gilroy, Luna, and O'Reilly promoted the series at Star Wars Celebration in May 2022, where they revealed the first teaser trailer [44] [42] The Hollywood Reporter's Aaron Couch said it showed the \"gritty side\" of the Star Wars universe [91] Daniel Chin of The Ringer felt the series had a unique identity in the Star Wars franchise, with a darker tone, and said the teaser \"paints a picture of the formative years of the rebellion against the Empire\" [92] Ryan Scott from /Film felt the teaser gave the \"most comprehensive view at the show up to this point\" He said the series could explore the morality behind the Rebels, writing that while they are usually seen as heroes there is also \"much gray area in there to be explored\" [93] Writing for CNET, Sean Keane felt the trailer did not give much away but gave an \"intriguing taste of the show's espionage tone\" [94]\n\n\nRelease\nAndor premiered on Disney+ on September 21,

Willimon and Gilroy's brother Dan [6] [24] Gilroy urged his writing team to put aside their personal reverence and nostalgia for Star Wars, fearing that such an attitude could change their behavior and work [46] Gilroy wanted the series to be accessible to all viewers, not just Star Wars fans, with the hope that those fans would be able to watch the series with their friends and family who are not interested in the rest of the franchise [4] He had also wanted to ensure the series was grounded in reality and had identified the main \"navigational Star Wars piece of information\" as being the calendar During the first writers' room meeting, Gilroy had prepared a 100-page outline for the series, as he had already planned the structure of the series Willimon and Dan Gilroy were present, in addition to executive producer Sanne Wohlenberg and production designer Luke Hull, calling Hull his \"primary creative collaborator on the story\" They had discussed the story for five days [31] Luna

including Rogue One [56] He said his team was treating the series the same as they did the films, [37] and due to Gilroy's involvement the series would fit within the same \"pocket of  [Star Wars] history\" as Rogue One with a \"slightly harder edge\" than other Star Wars projects [56] Scanlan added that unused creatures developed for the films could be brought back for the series, [57] alongside newly created creatures [37] An outdoor city set, which co-star Adria Arjona estimated to be three to five city blocks long, was built practically for the series [58]\n\n\nCasting\nDiego

with the production based at Pinewood Studios [64] [65] The series was filmed under the working title Pilgrim, [64] and was the first live-action Star Wars series to not make use of the StageCraft digital background technology This was done because the scripts were more suited to being filmed on locations and large sets, and Luna noted that taking a different filming approach for the series made it similar to Rogue One, whose filming style was distinct from other Star Wars films [66] Toby Haynes directed the first three episodes, [35] with Ben Caron, Susanna White, and Haynes each directing another \"block\" of three episodes [8] [39] Jonathan Freeman and Adriano Goldman served as cinematographers [41] [67] The series was previously reported to begin filming in 2019, [28] and

he could compose source music that would be played on set Gilroy and Britell, who are neighbors in Manhattan, first met for the project in August 2020 Kennedy and Gilroy wanted the series to have a unique sound, and Britell said it would be \"orchestral-plus\" with a \"wide range of sounds\" including some that he had created He added that the large scope of the series meant that \"every episode has new demands, new music, and new ideas It's important that as the story evolves, the music should evolve too.\" [89] Britell was publicly revealed to be the series' composer in February 2022, [90] and was still working on it that May when he said they had been \"working nonstop for months, actually years, at this point\" Recording was underway by then at AIR Lyndhurst studios in London, with a full orchestra Britell was unable to travel to London due to the pandemic, but had a team in place there that also worked with him on other television series [89]\n\n\nMarketing\nA sizzle reel

Kennedy [36] [37] Gilroy, Luna, and O'Reilly promoted the series at Star Wars Celebration in May 2022, where they revealed the first teaser trailer [44] [42] The Hollywood Reporter's Aaron Couch said it showed the \"gritty side\" of the Star Wars universe [91] Daniel Chin of The Ringer felt the series had a unique identity in the Star Wars franchise, with a darker tone, and said the teaser \"paints a picture of the formative years of the rebellion against the Empire\" [92] Ryan Scott from /Film felt the teaser gave the \"most comprehensive view at the show up to this point\" He said the series could explore the morality behind the Rebels, writing that while they are usually seen as heroes there is also \"much gray area in there to be explored\" [93] Writing for CNET, Sean Keane felt the trailer did not give much away but gave an \"intriguing taste of the show's espionage tone\" [94]\n\n\nRelease\nAndor premiered on Disney+ on September 21, 2022, with the first three episodes

around the world, prompting Sultan Ahmad Shah, the head of the Asian Football Confederation, to step in [4] FIFA boss João Havelange had long backed the Japanese bid, [5] but his rival in FIFA, UEFA chief Lennart Johansson, sought to undermine Havelange's plans [5] UEFA and the AFC viewed co-hosting between the two Asian rivals as the best option [5] South Korea and Japan were finally faced with a choice of having no World Cup or a shared World Cup and they reluctantly chose to go along with co-hosting [5] South Korea and Japan were chosen unanimously as co-hosts in preference to Mexico [6]

Cup to be hosted in Asia, the other being the 2022 World Cup hosted by Qatar twenty years later and the first World Cup to be held outside of Europe and the Americas The general secretary of South Korea's bidding committee, Song Young-shik, stated that FIFA was interested in staging some matches in North Korea in order to aid Korean reunification, but it was ruled out

displayed as a greeting to international guests in a manner that was designed to promote harmony [81]\n\n\nConcerns\nThe World Cup was originally going to be hosted either in Japan or in South Korea, but in the end both rivals had decided to share the hosting duties thus making this World Cup the first to have multiple host nations However, there were concerns regarding the selection of hosts due to logistical issues caused by fans traveling across two separate sovereign nations as well as whether some of the 20 stadiums to be constructed for the World Cup would be ready in time for it or not While political and infrastructural problems were eventually overcome, there still remained the issue of East Asia's wet season which could disrupt the play The timing of the tournament thus had been altered to mitigate as much as possible against such issues, with the tournament kicking off on May 31 and due to run until June 30, the earliest date for a World Cup final since 1986 [84]\n\n\nAftermath and legacy\nThe tournament had a major economic impact on both South Korea and Japan, generating an estimated US$1.3 billion in revenue [86] Spending from World Cup tourists in South Korea created US$307 million in direct income and US$713 million in valued added [86] Japan spent an estimated US$5.6 billion on preparations for the event, which had a US$24.8 billion impact on the Japanese economy and accounted for 0.6% of their GDP in 2002 [87]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "# 2002 FIFA World Cup\n\nThe 2002 FIFA World Cup was the 18th edition of the FIFA World Cup, the world championship of association football.

This was the first World Cup to be hosted by multiple countries, with both South Korea and Japan sharing the hosting duties.\n\n## Host selection\n\nSouth Korea and Japan were selected as hosts by FIFA on May 31, 1996. Initially, South Korea, Japan, and Mexico presented three rival bids. South Korea's entry into the race was seen by some as a response to the bid of political and sporting rival Japan. FIFA leaders were split on whom to favor as host, with politics within the world governing body holding sway. With Mexico regarded as a long shot, the battle to host the tournament came down to South Korea and Japan. The two Asian rivals went on a massive and expensive PR blitz around the world, prompting Sultan Ahmad Shah, the head of the Asian Football Confederation, to step in. FIFA boss João Havelange had long backed the Japanese bid, but his rival in FIFA, UEFA chief Lennart Johansson, sought to undermine Havelange's plans. UEFA and the AFC viewed co-hosting between the two Asian rivals as the best option. South Korea and Japan were finally faced with a choice of having no World Cup or a shared World Cup, and they reluctantly chose to go along with co-hosting. South Korea and Japan were chosen unanimously as co-hosts in preference to Mexico. This was the first World Cup to be hosted by more than one country, and the second being the 2026 World Cup, which will be hosted by the United States, Mexico, and Canada.

The three individual names were selected from shortlists by users on the Internet and at McDonald's outlets in the host countries.\n\n## Match ball\n\nThe official match ball was the Fevernova, manufactured by Adidas.\n\n## Music\n\nThe official song was \"Boom.\" The official local song of this World Cup was \"Let's Get Together Now.\" The official anthem was \"Anthem.\"\n\n## Cultural event\n\nThe official FIFA cultural event of the 2002 World Cup was a flag festival called Poetry of the Winds. Held in Nanjicheon Park, an area of the World Cup Park close to Seoul World Cup Stadium, Poetry of the Winds was exhibited from May 29 to June 25 in order to wish success upon the World Cup and promote a festive atmosphere. During the flag art festival, hand-painted flags from global artists were displayed as a greeting to international guests in a manner that was designed to promote harmony.\n\n## Concerns\n\nThe World Cup was originally going to be hosted either in Japan or in South Korea, but in the end, both rivals had decided to share the hosting duties, thus making this World Cup the first to have multiple host nations. However, there were concerns regarding the selection of hosts due to logistical issues caused by fans traveling across two separate sovereign nations, as well as whether some of the 20 stadiums to be constructed for the World Cup would be ready in time for it or not. While political and infrastructural problems were eventually overcome, there still remained the issue of East Asia's wet season, which could disrupt the play. The timing of the tournament was thus altered to mitigate as much as possible against such issues, with the tournament kicking off on May 31 and due to run until June 30, the earliest date for a World Cup final since 1986.\n\n## Aftermath and legacy\n\nThe tournament had a major economic impact on both South Korea and Japan, generating an estimated $1.3 billion in revenue. Spending from World Cup tourists in South Korea created $307 million in direct income and $713 million in valued-added. Japan spent an estimated $5.6 billion on preparations for the event, which had a $24.8 billion impact on the Japanese economy and accounted for 0.6% of their GDP in 2002.\n\n## See also\n\n* 2002 FIFA

were selected as hosts by FIFA on 31 May 1996 Initially, South Korea, Japan and Mexico presented three rival bids South Korea's entry into the race was seen by some as a response to the bid of political and sporting rival Japan [4] FIFA leaders were split on whom to favor as host as politics within the world governing body held sway [5] With Mexico regarded as a long shot, the battle to host the tournament came down to South Korea and Japan The two Asian rivals went on a massive and expensive PR blitz around the world, prompting Sultan Ahmad Shah, the head of the Asian Football Confederation, to step in [4] FIFA boss João Havelange had long backed the Japanese bid, [5] but his rival in FIFA, UEFA chief Lennart Johansson, sought to undermine Havelange's plans [5] UEFA and the AFC viewed co-hosting between the two Asian rivals as the best option [5] South Korea and Japan were finally faced with a choice of having no World Cup or a shared World Cup and they reluctantly chose to go along with co-hosting [5] South Korea and Japan were chosen unanimously as co-hosts in preference to Mexico [6] This was the first World Cup to be hosted by more than one country, the second being the 2026 World Cup, which will be hosted by the United States, Mexico and Canada This is also the first ever World Cup to be hosted in Asia, the other being the 2022 World Cup hosted by Qatar twenty years later and the first World Cup to be held outside of Europe and the Americas The general secretary of South Korea's bidding committee, Song Young-shik, stated that FIFA was interested in staging some matches in North Korea in order to aid Korean reunification, but it was ruled out [7]\n\n\nQualification\n199 teams attempted to qualify for the 2002 World Cup The qualification process began with the preliminary draw held in Tokyo on 7 December 1999 Defending champions France and co-hosts South Korea and Japan qualified automatically and did not have to play any qualification matches This was the final World Cup in which the defending champions qualified automatically [11]\n\n\nList of qualified teams\nThe following 32 teams, shown with final pre-tournament rankings, [12] qualified for the final tournament:\n\n\nVenues\nSouth Korea and Japan each provided 10 venues, the vast majority of them newly built for the tournament Groups A–D played all their matches in South Korea and Groups E–H played all their matches in Japan [13] The stadiums in Daegu, Suwon, Yokohama and Saitama all hosted 4 matches each, while the other 16 stadiums hosted 3 matches each Notably, no matches were played in Tokyo, making it the second capital of a host country not to have a World Cup venue after Bonn of West Germany in 1974 [a]\n\n\nMatch officials\n\n\n\nSquads\nThis was the first World Cup that featured squads of 23 players, an increase from 22 previously Of the 23 players, three must be goalkeepers.\n\n\nDraw\nThe FIFA Organising Committee announced the eight seeded teams on 28 November 2001 The historic tradition to seed the hosts (Japan and South Korea) and holders (France) was upheld while the remaining five seeds were granted to the other five of the top six teams—ranked by their results in the last three FIFA World Cups (ratio 3:2:1) and their FIFA World Ranking position in the last month of the past three years (equal ratio) [38]\n\n\nDraw results and

of the game Sweden and Senegal faced off in Ōita and finished 1–1 in regular time and it took a golden goal from Henri Camara in extra time to settle the game for Senegal 2–1, which led to Senegal becoming only the second African team to reach the last eight (after Cameroon in 1990) Spain and the Republic of Ireland played in Suwon, where Spain led most of the match 1–0 until a late penalty kick scored by Robbie Keane made the match go to extra time, where Spain emerged victorious in a penalty shoot-out The United States beat CONCACAF rivals Mexico 2–0 in Jeonju with Brian McBride and

Korea's win ensured that, for the very first time in the Cup's history, teams from five continents – Europe, North America, South America, Africa and Asia – reached the quarter-finals of the same tournament.\n\n\nRound of 16\nIn the round of 16, Germany beat Paraguay 1–0 with a late goal by Oliver Neuville in Seogwipo England defeated Denmark in Niigata 3–0, with all goals occurring in the

as Brazil won 2–1 [45] The United States lost to Germany 1–0 in Ulsan by a Michael Ballack goal in the 39th minute, but controversy surrounded the game when United States demanded the referee give a penalty for a goal-line handball by Torsten Frings in the 49th minute, but the referee did not award the penalty South Korea got another success in Gwangju in a controversial manner, overcoming Spain 5–3 on penalties after a 0–0 draw in which the Spaniards twice thought they had scored while onside; however, the efforts were disallowed by the referee with controversial decisions [46] [47] The hosts became the first team in the Asian Football Confederation to reach the semi-finals of the World Cup, eclipsing the record of their North Korean counterparts who reached the quarter-finals in 1966 They also became the first World Cup semi-final team not from UEFA or CONMEBOL since the United States did it in the first World Cup in 1930 Turkey defeated Senegal 1–0 in Osaka, with a golden goal scored by İlhan Mansız in the 94th minute.\n\n\nSemi-finals\nThe semi-finals saw two 1–0 games; the first semi-final, played in Seoul, saw Michael Ballack's goal suffice for Germany to eliminate South Korea However, Ballack had already received a yellow card during the match before, which forced him to miss the final based on accumulated yellow cards [48] The next day in Saitama saw Ronaldo score a goal early in the second half, his sixth of the competition for Brazil, to defeat Turkey in a replay of their Group C encounter [49] [50]\n\n\nThird place play-off\nIn the third-place match in Daegu, Turkey beat the South Koreans 3–2, their first goal coming from Hakan Şükür straight from the opening kick-off (even though South Korea kicked off) in 10.8 seconds, the fastest ever goal in World Cup history [51]\n\n\nFinal\nIn the final match held in Yokohama, Japan, two goals from Ronaldo secured the World Cup for Brazil as they claimed victory over Germany [52] Ronaldo scored twice in the second half and, after the game, won the Golden Shoe award for the tournament's leading scorer with eight goals [53] This was the fifth time Brazil had won the World Cup, cementing their status as the most successful national team in the history of the competition Brazil became the only team since Argentina in 1986 to win the trophy without needing to win a penalty shoot-out at some stage during the knockout phase and the total number of penalty shoot-outs (2) was the lowest since the four-round knockout format was introduced in 1986 Brazil also became the first team to win every match at a World Cup since 1970 and set a new record for highest aggregate goal difference (+14) for a World Cup winner Brazil's captain Cafu, who became the first player to appear in three successive World Cup finals, accepted the trophy on behalf of the team.\n\n\nStatistics\nRonaldo won the Golden Shoe after scoring eight goals In total, 161 goals were scored by 109 players, with three of them

{"title": "Traditionis_custodes", "content": "\nBackground\nIn 1969, the first new edition of the Roman Missal based on the revisions of the Second Vatican Council was promulgated, instituting a new form of the Roman Rite's Mass liturgy Often referred to as the Mass of Paul VI, this edition of the Roman Missal was produced in Latin with consideration that it was to be translated into the vernacular [2] [3] The first edition of this missal was published in 1970, around one year after its promulgation [4] It replaced the Roman Missal of the Tridentine Mass, the last edition of which was promulgated in 1962, as well as the various vernacular translations that are often referred to as the \"1965 Missal\", though themselves not a new form of the Roman Missal [citation needed] In 1971, the Liturgy of the Hours – also prepared with expectation of translation into the vernacular – was introduced to replace the 1960 edition of the Roman Breviary as the primary form of prayer for the canonical hours within the Latin Church [5]\n\n\nLiturgical reforms after Vatican II\nIn 1969, the first new edition of the Roman Missal based on the revisions of the Second Vatican Council was promulgated, instituting a new form of the Roman Rite's Mass liturgy Often referred to as the Mass of Paul VI, this edition of the Roman Missal was produced in Latin with consideration that it was to be translated into the vernacular [2] [3] The first edition of this missal was published in 1970, around one year after its promulgation [4] It replaced the Roman Missal of the Tridentine Mass, the last edition of which was promulgated in 1962, as well as the various vernacular translations that are often referred to as the \"1965 Missal\", though themselves not a new form of the Roman Missal [citation needed] In 1971, the Liturgy of the Hours – also prepared with expectation of translation into the vernacular – was introduced to replace the 1960 edition of the Roman Breviary as the primary form of prayer for the canonical hours within the Latin Church [5]\n\n\nJohn Paul II\nJohn Paul II in Quattuor abhinc annos in 1984 liberalised the use of the Tridentine Mass, while still maintaining limitations on its use [citation needed] This liberalisation was further expanded by the motu proprio Ecclesia Dei in 1988 [6]\n\n\nSummorum Pontificum\nIn 2007, Benedict XVI published the apostolic letter Summorum Pontificum which stated that while the Roman Missal promulgated by Paul VI is \"the ordinary expression of the lex orandi  [law of prayer] of the Catholic Church of the Latin Rite\", the Roman Missal promulgated by Pope Pius V and revised by John XXIII is nevertheless to be considered \"an extraordinary expression\" of the same lex orandi of the church [7] The Tridentine Mass was thus called the \"Extraordinary Form of the Roman Rite\", and the Mass of Paul VI the \"Ordinary Form of the Roman Rite\" [8]\n\n\nBefore the publication\nIn 2020, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith sent a letter to Catholic bishops of the world to ask them to report on the implementation of Summorum Pontificum in their dioceses [10] [11] The results of this survey were not made public [12]\n\n\nContent\nTraditionis custodes not only repealed the changes liberalising use of the Tridentine Mass in the motu proprio Summorum Pontificum, which had been issued by Francis's predecessor, Benedict XVI, in 2007, [9] [2] but it also went further to limit the practice of the Tridentine Mass [14]\n\n\nArticle 1\nIn the first article of the apostolic letter, Francis writes that the liturgical books issued by Popes Paul VI and John Paul II after Vatican II are \"the unique expression of the lex orandi  [law of prayer] of the Roman Rite\" [11] [15]\n\n\nArticle 2\nThe second article states that it is a diocesan bishop's \"exclusive competence\" to authorise the use of the 1962 Roman Missal in his diocese \"according to the guidelines of the Apostolic See\" [7] [11]\n\n\nArticle 3\nAnother measure is that \" [t]he bishop of the diocese in which until now there exist one or more groups that celebrate according to the Missal antecedent to the reform of 1970\" has \"to determine that these groups do not deny the validity and the legitimacy of the liturgical reform, dictated by Vatican Council II and the Magisterium of the Supreme Pontiffs\" [7]\n\n\nArticles 4 and 5\nPriests ordained after the publication of the motu proprio who wish to celebrate Mass according to the Tridentine Mass \"should submit a formal request to the diocesan bishop who shall consult the Apostolic See before granting this authorization\" Priests who already celebrate using the Roman Missal of 1962 \"should request from the diocesan Bishop the authorization to continue to enjoy this faculty\" [7]\n\n\nArticles 6 and 7\nInstitutes of consecrated life and societies of apostolic life that were established by the Pontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei – which was created by John Paul II in 1988 and merged into the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in 2019 –, now fall under the jurisdiction of the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life (CICLSAL) [11]\n\n\nArticle 8 and effect\nThe last article declares: \"previous norms, instructions, permissions, and customs that do not conform to the provisions of the present Motu Proprio are abrogated\" [11]\n\n\nAccompanying letter\nPope Francis also released an ecclesiastical letter to the bishops of the world along with Traditionis custodes explaining his decision, the same way Benedict XVI had done with Summorum Pontificum [2] [7] [11]\n\n\nIntroduction\nIn the letter accompanying the document, Francis explains that the concessions granted by his predecessors John Paul II and Benedict XVI for the use of the 1962 Roman Missal were above all \"motivated by the desire to foster the healing of the schism with the movement of Mons Lefebvre\" The request directed to the Catholic bishops to generously welcome the \"just aspirations\" of the members of the faithful who request the use of this Missal was also motivated by \"the ecclesial intention of restoring the unity of the Church\", writes Francis He adds that he believes \"many in the Church came to regard this faculty as an opportunity to adopt freely the Roman Missal promulgated by St Pius V and use it in a manner parallel to the Roman Missal promulgated by St Paul VI\" [16] [15]\n\n\nLetter of the CDF\nIn 2020, Francis asked the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith to send a letter to bishops to ask them about the implementation of Summorum Pontificum Francis says the bishops' answers \"reveal a situation that preoccupies and saddens me\" He explains that \"an opportunity offered by St John Paul II and, with even greater magnanimity, by Benedict XVI, intended to recover the unity of an ecclesial body with diverse liturgical sensibilities, was exploited to widen the gaps, reinforce the divergences, and encourage disagreements that injure the Church, block her path, and expose her to the peril of division\" [7]\n\n\nVatican II\nFrancis said that he deplores liturgical abuses \"on all sides\" and the fact that \"in many places the prescriptions of the new Missal are not observed in celebration, but indeed come to be interpreted as an authorization for or even a requirement of creativity, which leads to almost unbearable distortions\" However, Francis adds: \"I am nonetheless saddened that the instrumental use of the Roman Missal of 1962 is often characterized by a rejection not only of the liturgical reform, but of the Vatican Council II itself, claiming, with unfounded and unsustainable assertions, that it betrayed the Tradition and the 'true Church'\" Francis rejects that claim and explains that \"the path of the Church must be seen within the dynamic of Tradition 'which originates from the Apostles and progresses in the Church with the assistance of the Holy Spirit' (Dei Verbum, 8)\" He recalled that \"a recent stage of this dynamic was constituted by Vatican Council II where the Catholic episcopate came together to listen and to discern the path for the Church indicated by the Holy Spirit\" He adds: \"To doubt the  [Vatican II] Council is to doubt the intentions of those very Fathers who exercised their collegial power in a solemn manner cum Petro et sub Petro  [with Peter and under Peter] in an ecumenical council, and, in the final analysis, to doubt the Holy Spirit itself who guides the Church\" [7]\n\n\nUnity of the church\nFrancis states his \"final reason\" for his decision is that \"ever more plain in the words and attitudes of many is the close connection between the choice of celebrations according to the liturgical books prior to Vatican Council II and the rejection of the Church and her institutions in the name of what is called the 'true Church'\" Francis adds: \"One is dealing here with comportment that contradicts communion and nurtures the divisive tendency—'I belong to Paul; I belong instead to Apollo; I belong to Cephas; I belong to Christ'—against which the Apostle Paul so vigorously reacted [a]\" For this reason, he says, \" [i]n defense of the unity of the Body of Christ, I am constrained to revoke the faculty granted by my Predecessors The distorted

Tridentine Mass\nIn this letter, Francis writes: \"I take the firm decision to abrogate all the norms, instructions, permissions and customs that precede the present motu proprio, and declare that the liturgical books promulgated by the saintly Pontiffs Paul VI and John Paul II, in conformity with the decrees of Vatican Council II, constitute the unique expression of the lex orandi  [law of prayer] of the Roman Rite I take comfort in this decision from the fact that, after the Council of Trent, St Pius V also abrogated all the rites that could not claim a proven antiquity, establishing for the whole Latin Church a single Roman Missal\" [7] [15]\n\n\nAppeal\nPope Francis appeals to the bishops in his letter, saying: \"While in the exercise of my ministry in the service of unity, I take the decision to suspend the faculty granted by my predecessors, I ask you to share with me this burden as a form of participation in the solicitude for the whole Church proper to the bishops\" [7]\n\n\nInstructions to the bishops\nFrancis gave explicit instructions to the bishops to take measures to strongly limit the use of the Tridentine Rite, with the clear goal of getting all Catholics to eventually celebrate only the reformed liturgy which followed Vatican II Francis wrote: \"Indications about how to proceed in your dioceses are chiefly dictated by two principles: on the one hand, to provide for the good of those who are rooted in the previous form of celebration and need to return in due time to the Roman Rite promulgated by Saints Paul VI and John Paul II, and, on the other hand, to discontinue the erection of new personal parishes tied more to the desire and wishes of individual priests than to the real need of the 'holy People of God'\" [17]\n\n\nCongregation for

reforms sacraments, since the restrictions contained in Traditionis custodes are \"reserved in a special way to the Apostolic See\" It also states that bishops which had dispensed those restrictions

Benedict considered the restriction of the Tridentine mass to be \"a mistake\" since it \"jeopardized the attempt at pacification\" between the Tridentine Mass and the Mass of Paul VI; Gänswein also

"lang": "en", "article": "**Traditionis custodes**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nTraditionis custodes is a motu proprio apostolic letter issued by Pope Francis on July 16, 2021, which restricts the use of the Tridentine Mass, also known as the \"Extraordinary Form\" of the Roman Rite, in the Catholic Church. The document, which means \"Guardians of the Tradition\" in Latin, repeals the norms and permissions granted by Pope Benedict XVI's motu proprio Summorum Pontificum in 2007.\n\n**Background**\n\nIn 1969, the first new edition of the Roman Missal based on the revisions of the Second Vatican Council was promulgated, instituting a new form of the Roman Rite's Mass liturgy. Often referred to as the Mass of Paul VI, this edition of the Roman Missal was produced in Latin with consideration that it was to be translated into the vernacular. The first edition of this missal was published in 1970, around one year after its promulgation. It replaced the Roman Missal of the Tridentine Mass, the last edition of which was promulgated in 1962, as well as the various vernacular translations that are often referred to as the \"1965 Missal\", though themselves not a new form of the Roman Missal. In 1971, the Liturgy of the Hours – also prepared with expectation of translation into the vernacular – was introduced to replace the 1960 edition of the Roman Breviary as the primary form of prayer for the canonical hours within the Latin Church.\n\n**John Paul II**\n\nJohn Paul II in Quattuor abhinc annos in 1984 liberalised the use of the Tridentine Mass, while still maintaining limitations on its use. This liberalisation was further expanded by the motu proprio Ecclesia Dei in 1988.\n\n**Summorum Pontificum**\n\nIn 2007, Benedict XVI published the apostolic letter Summorum Pontificum which stated that while the Roman Missal promulgated by Paul VI is \"the ordinary expression of the lex orandi  [law of prayer] of the Catholic Church of the Latin Rite\", the Roman Missal promulgated by Pope Pius V and revised by John XXIII is nevertheless to be considered \"an extraordinary expression\" of the same lex orandi of the church. The Tridentine Mass was thus called the \"Extraordinary Form of the Roman Rite\", and the Mass of Paul VI the \"Ordinary Form of the Roman Rite\".\n\n**Traditionis custodes**\n\nIn 2020, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith sent a letter to Catholic bishops of the world to ask them to report on the implementation of Summorum Pontificum in their dioceses. The results of this survey were not made public. Traditionis custodes not only repealed the changes liberalising use of the Tridentine Mass in the motu proprio Summorum Pontificum, but it also went further to limit the practice of the Tridentine Mass.\n\n**Article 1**\n\nIn the first article of the apostolic letter, Francis writes that the liturgical books issued by Popes Paul VI and John Paul II after Vatican II are \"the unique expression of the lex orandi  [law of prayer] of the Roman Rite\".\n\n**Article 2**\n\nThe second article states that it is a diocesan bishop's \"exclusive competence\" to authorise the use of the 1962 Roman Missal in his diocese \"according to the guidelines of the Apostolic See\".\n\n**Article 3**\n\nAnother measure is that \" [t]he bishop of the diocese in which until now there exist one or more groups that celebrate according to the Missal antecedent to the reform of 1970\" has \"to determine that these groups do not deny the validity and the legitimacy of the liturgical reform, dictated by Vatican Council II and the Magisterium of the Supreme Pontiffs\".\n\n**Articles 4 and 5**\n\nPriests ordained after the publication of the motu proprio who wish to celebrate Mass according to the Tridentine Mass \"should submit a formal request to the diocesan bishop who shall consult the Apostolic See before granting this authorization\". Priests who already celebrate using the Roman Missal of 1962 \"should request from the diocesan Bishop the authorization to continue to enjoy this faculty\".\n\n**Articles 6 and 7**\n\nInstitutes of consecrated life and societies of apostolic life that were established by the Pontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei – which was created by John Paul II in 1988 and merged into the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in 2019 –, now fall under the jurisdiction of the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life (CICLSAL).\n\n**Article 8**\n\nThe last article declares: \"previous norms, instructions, permissions, and customs that do not conform to the provisions of the present Motu Proprio are abrogated\".\n\n**Accompanying letter**\n\nPope Francis also released an ecclesiastical letter to the bishops of the world along with Traditionis custodes explaining his decision, the same way Benedict XVI had done with Summorum Pontificum.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nIn the letter accompanying the document, Francis explains that the concessions granted by his predecessors John Paul II and Benedict XVI for the use of the 1962 Roman Missal were above all \"motivated by the desire to foster the healing of the schism with the movement of Mons Lefebvre\". The request directed to the Catholic bishops to generously welcome the \"just aspirations\" of the members of the faithful who request the use of this Missal was also motivated by \"the ecclesial intention of restoring the unity of the Church\", writes Francis. He adds that he believes \"many in the Church came to regard this faculty as an opportunity to adopt freely the Roman Missal promulgated by St Pius V and use it in a manner parallel to the Roman Missal promulgated by St Paul VI\".\n\n**Letter of the CDF**\n\nIn 2020, Francis asked the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith to send a letter to bishops to ask them about the implementation of Summorum Pontificum. Francis says the bishops' answers \"reveal a situation that preoccupies and saddens me\". He explains that \"an opportunity offered by St John Paul II and, with even greater magnanimity, by Benedict XVI, intended to recover the unity of an ecclesial body with diverse liturgical sensibilities, was exploited to widen the gaps, reinforce the divergences, and encourage disagreements that injure the Church, block her path, and expose her to the peril of division\".\n\n**Vatican II**\n\nFrancis said that he deplores liturgical abuses \"on all sides\" and the fact that \"in many places the prescriptions of the new Missal are not observed in celebration, but indeed come to be interpreted as an authorization for or even a requirement of creativity, which leads to almost unbearable distortions\". However, Francis adds: \"I am nonetheless saddened that the instrumental use of the Roman Missal of 1962 is often characterized by a rejection not only of the liturgical reform, but of the Vatican Council II itself, claiming, with unfounded and unsustainable assertions, that it betrayed the Tradition and the 'true Church'\". Francis rejects that claim and explains that \"the path of the Church must be seen within the dynamic of Tradition 'which originates from the Apostles and progresses in the Church with the assistance of the Holy Spirit' (Dei Verbum, 8)\". He recalled that \"a recent stage of this dynamic was constituted by Vatican Council II where the Catholic episcopate came together to listen and to discern the path for the Church indicated by the Holy Spirit\".\n\n**Unity of the church**\n\nFrancis states his \"final reason\" for his decision is that \"ever more plain in the words and attitudes of many is the close connection between the choice of celebrations according to the liturgical books prior to Vatican Council II and the rejection of the Church and her institutions in the name of what is called the 'true Church'\". Francis adds: \"One is dealing here with comportment that contradicts communion and nurtures the divisive tendency—'I belong to Paul; I belong instead to Apollo; I belong to Cephas; I belong to Christ'—against which the Apostle Paul so vigorously reacted\". For this reason, he says, \" [i]n defense of the unity of the Body of Christ, I am constrained to revoke the faculty granted by my Predecessors The distorted use that has been made of this faculty is contrary to the intentions that led to granting the freedom to celebrate the Mass with the Missale Romanum of 1962\".\n\n**Comparison with the Tridentine Mass**\n\nIn this letter, Francis writes: \"I take the firm decision to abrogate all the norms, instructions, permissions and customs that precede the present motu proprio, and declare that the liturgical books promulgated by the saintly Pontiffs Paul VI and John Paul II, in conformity with the decrees of Vatican Council II, constitute the unique expression of the lex orandi  [law of prayer] of the Roman Rite I take comfort in this decision from the fact that, after the Council of Trent, St Pius V also abrogated all the rites that could not claim a proven antiquity, establishing for the whole Latin Church a single Roman Missal\".\n\n**Appeal**\n\nPope Francis appeals to the bishops in his letter, saying: \"While in the exercise of my ministry in the service of unity, I take the decision to suspend the faculty granted by my predecessors, I ask you to share with me this burden as a form of participation in the solicitude for the whole Church proper to the bishops\".\n\n**Instructions to the bishops**\n\nFrancis gave explicit instructions to the bishops to take measures to strongly limit the use of the Tridentine Rite, with the clear goal of getting all Catholics to eventually celebrate only the reformed liturgy which followed Vatican II Francis wrote: \"Indications about how to proceed in your dioceses are chiefly dictated by two principles: on the one hand, to provide for the good of those who are rooted in the previous form of celebration and need to return in due time to the Roman Rite promulgated by Saints Paul VI and John Paul II, and, on the other hand, to discontinue the erection of new personal parishes tied more to the desire and wishes of individual priests than to the real need of the 'holy People of God'\".\n\n**Congregation for Divine Worship official guidelines**\n\nOn 18 December 2021, the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments (CDW), the Holy See office responsible for matters related to liturgy, released official guidelines and clarifications, approved by Pope Francis, on the implementation of Traditionis custodes Those guidelines are dated 4 December 2021 The guidelines are structured as individual responsa to 11 questions, with explanatory notes included.\n\n**Responsa**\n\nThe responsa provide detailed answers to questions about the implementation of Traditionis custodes, including questions about the use of the Tridentine Mass, the role of diocesan bishops, and the relationship between the Tridentine Mass and the reformed liturgy.\n\n**Rescript**\n\nOn 21 February 2023, the Holy See published a papal rescript written by Arthur Roche, Prefect of the Dicastery for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments (DDW); the rescript had been approved by the pope the day before The rescript clarifies that canon 87

for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, which will evaluate the individual cases\".\n\n**Reception**\n\nAmerican Cardinal Raymond Burke, who served as Prefect of the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura until 2014, told National Catholic Register that \"he sees as a number of flaws in Traditionis Custodes, saying he could not understand how the new Roman Missal is the

the 1960 edition of the Roman Breviary as the primary form of prayer for the canonical hours within the Latin Church [5]\n\n\nJohn Paul II\nJohn Paul II in Quattuor abhinc annos in 1984 liberalised the use of the Tridentine Mass, while still maintaining limitations on its use [citation needed] This liberalisation was further expanded by the motu proprio Ecclesia Dei in 1988 [6]\n\n\nSummorum Pontificum\nIn 2007, Benedict XVI published the apostolic letter Summorum Pontificum which stated that while the Roman Missal promulgated by Paul VI is \"the ordinary expression of the lex orandi  [law of prayer] of the Catholic Church of the Latin Rite\", the Roman Missal promulgated by Pope Pius V and revised by John XXIII is nevertheless to be considered \"an extraordinary expression\" of the same lex orandi of the church [7] The Tridentine Mass was thus called the \"Extraordinary Form of the Roman Rite\", and the Mass of Paul VI the \"Ordinary Form of the Roman Rite\" [8]\n\n\nBefore the publication\nIn 2020, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith sent a letter to Catholic bishops of the world to ask them to report on the implementation of Summorum Pontificum in their dioceses [10] [11] The results of this survey were not made public [12]\n\n\nContent\nTraditionis custodes not only repealed the changes liberalising use of the Tridentine Mass in the motu proprio Summorum Pontificum, which had been issued by Francis's predecessor, Benedict XVI, in 2007, [9] [2] but it also went further to limit the practice of the Tridentine Mass [14]\n\n\nArticle 1\nIn the first article of the apostolic letter, Francis writes that the liturgical books issued by Popes Paul VI and John Paul II after Vatican II are \"the unique expression of the lex orandi  [law of prayer] of the Roman Rite\" [11] [15]\n\n\nArticle 2\nThe second article states that it is a diocesan bishop's \"exclusive competence\" to authorise the use of the 1962 Roman Missal in his diocese \"according to the guidelines of the Apostolic See\" [7] [11]\n\n\nArticle 3\nAnother measure is that \" [t]he bishop of the diocese in which until now there exist one or more groups that celebrate according to the Missal antecedent to the reform of 1970\" has \"to determine that these groups do not deny the validity and the legitimacy of the liturgical reform, dictated by Vatican Council II and the Magisterium of the Supreme Pontiffs\" [7]\n\n\nArticles 4 and 5\nPriests ordained after the publication of the motu proprio who wish to celebrate Mass according to the Tridentine Mass \"should submit a formal request to the diocesan bishop who shall consult the Apostolic See before granting this authorization\" Priests who already celebrate using the Roman Missal of 1962 \"should request from the diocesan Bishop the authorization to continue to enjoy this faculty\" [7]\n\n\nArticles 6 and 7\nInstitutes of consecrated life and societies of apostolic life that were established by the Pontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei – which was created by John Paul II in 1988 and merged into the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in 2019 –, now fall under the jurisdiction of the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life (CICLSAL) [11]\n\n\nArticle 8 and effect\nThe last article declares: \"previous norms, instructions, permissions, and customs that do not conform to the provisions of the present Motu Proprio are abrogated\" [11]\n\n\nAccompanying letter\nPope Francis also released an ecclesiastical letter to the bishops of the world along with Traditionis custodes explaining his decision, the same way Benedict XVI had done with Summorum Pontificum [2] [7] [11]\n\n\nIntroduction\nIn the letter accompanying the document, Francis explains that the concessions granted by his predecessors John Paul II and Benedict XVI for the use of the 1962 Roman Missal were above all \"motivated by the desire to foster the healing of the schism with the movement of Mons Lefebvre\" The request directed to the Catholic bishops to generously welcome the \"just aspirations\" of the members of the faithful who request the use of this Missal was also motivated by \"the ecclesial intention of restoring the unity of the Church\", writes Francis He adds that he believes \"many in the Church came to regard this faculty as an opportunity to adopt freely the Roman Missal promulgated by St Pius V and use it in a manner parallel to the Roman Missal promulgated by St Paul VI\" [16] [15]\n\n\nLetter of the CDF\nIn 2020, Francis asked the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith to send a letter to bishops to ask them about the implementation of Summorum Pontificum Francis says the bishops' answers \"reveal a situation that preoccupies and saddens me\" He explains that \"an opportunity offered by St John Paul II and, with even greater magnanimity, by Benedict XVI, intended to recover the unity of an ecclesial body with diverse liturgical sensibilities, was exploited to widen the gaps, reinforce the divergences, and encourage disagreements that injure the Church, block her path, and expose her to the peril of division\" [7]\n\n\nVatican II\nFrancis said that he deplores liturgical abuses \"on all sides\" and the fact that \"in many places the prescriptions of the new Missal are not observed in celebration, but indeed come to be interpreted as an authorization for or even a requirement of creativity, which leads to almost unbearable distortions\" However, Francis adds: \"I am nonetheless saddened that the instrumental use of the Roman Missal of 1962 is often characterized by a rejection not only of the liturgical reform, but of the Vatican Council II itself, claiming, with unfounded and unsustainable assertions, that it betrayed the Tradition and the 'true Church'\" Francis rejects that claim and explains that \"the path of the Church must be seen within the dynamic of Tradition 'which originates from the Apostles and progresses in the Church with the assistance of the Holy Spirit' (Dei Verbum, 8)\" He recalled that \"a recent stage of this dynamic was constituted by Vatican Council II where the Catholic episcopate came together to listen and to discern the path for the Church indicated by the Holy Spirit\" He adds: \"To doubt the  [Vatican II] Council is to doubt the intentions of those very Fathers who exercised their collegial power in a solemn manner cum Petro et sub Petro  [with Peter and under Peter] in an ecumenical council, and, in the final analysis, to doubt the Holy Spirit itself who guides the Church\" [7]\n\n\nUnity of the church\nFrancis states his \"final reason\" for his decision is that \"ever more plain in the words and attitudes of many is the close connection between the choice of celebrations according to the liturgical books prior to Vatican Council II and the rejection of the Church and her institutions in the name of what is called the 'true Church'\" Francis adds: \"One is dealing here with comportment that contradicts communion and nurtures the divisive tendency—'I belong to Paul; I belong instead to Apollo; I belong to Cephas; I belong to Christ'—against which the Apostle Paul so vigorously reacted [a]\" For this reason, he says, \" [i]n defense of the unity of the Body of Christ, I am constrained to revoke the faculty granted by my Predecessors The distorted use that has been made of this faculty is contrary to the intentions that led to granting the freedom to celebrate the Mass with the Missale Romanum of 1962\" [7] [11]\n\n\nComparison with the Tridentine Mass\nIn this letter, Francis writes: \"I take the firm decision to abrogate all the norms, instructions, permissions and customs that precede the present motu proprio, and declare that the liturgical books promulgated by the saintly Pontiffs Paul VI and John Paul II, in conformity with the decrees of Vatican Council II, constitute the unique expression of the lex orandi  [law of prayer] of the Roman Rite I take comfort in this decision from the fact that, after the Council of Trent, St Pius V also abrogated all the rites that could not claim a proven antiquity, establishing for the whole Latin Church a single Roman Missal\" [7] [15]\n\n\nAppeal\nPope Francis appeals to the bishops in his letter, saying: \"While in the exercise of my ministry in the service of unity, I take the decision to suspend the faculty granted by my predecessors, I ask you to share with me this burden as a form of participation in the solicitude for the whole Church proper to the bishops\" [7]\n\n\nInstructions to the bishops\nFrancis gave explicit instructions to the bishops to take measures to strongly limit the use of the Tridentine Rite, with the clear goal of getting all Catholics to eventually celebrate only the reformed liturgy which followed Vatican II Francis wrote: \"Indications about how to proceed in your dioceses are chiefly dictated by two principles: on the one hand, to provide for the good of those who are rooted in the previous form of celebration and need to return in due time to the Roman Rite promulgated by Saints Paul VI and John Paul II, and, on the other hand, to discontinue the erection of new personal parishes tied more to the desire and wishes of individual priests than to the real need of the 'holy People of God'\" [17]\n\n\nCongregation for Divine Worship official guidelines\nOn 18 December 2021, the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments (CDW), [b] the Holy See office responsible for matters related to liturgy, released official guidelines and clarifications, approved by Pope Francis, on the implementation of Traditionis custodes Those guidelines are dated 4 December 2021 The guidelines are structured as individual responsa to 11 questions, with explanatory notes included [18] [19] [20]\n\n\nResponsa\nOn 18 December 2021, the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments (CDW), [b] the Holy See office responsible for matters related to liturgy, released official guidelines and clarifications, approved by Pope Francis, on the implementation of Traditionis custodes Those guidelines are dated 4 December 2021 The guidelines are structured as individual responsa to 11 questions, with explanatory notes included [18] [19] [20]\n\n\nRescript\nOn 21 February 2023, the Holy See published a papal rescript written by Arthur Roche, Prefect of Dicastery for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments (DDW); the rescript had been approved by the pope the day before The rescript clarifies that canon 87 of the 1983 Code of Canon Law cannot be used by diocesan bishops to allow the faithful to continue celebrating Tridentine Mass and pre-Vatican II reforms sacraments, since the restrictions contained in Traditionis custodes are \"reserved in a special way to the Apostolic See\" It also states that bishops which had dispensed those restrictions by relying on this canon, must \"inform the Dicastery for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, which will evaluate the individual cases\" [24] [25] [26] [27] The rescript also states: \"the Holy Father confirms - having already expressed his assent in the audience of 18 November 2021 - what was established in the Responsa ad dubia with the annexed Explanatory Notes of 4 December 2021\" [26] [27] [28]\n\n\nReception\nAmerican Cardinal Raymond Burke, who served as Prefect of the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura until 2014, told National Catholic Register that \"he sees as a number of flaws in Traditionis Custodes, saying he could not understand how the new Roman Missal is the 'unique expression of the lex orandi of the Roman Rite,' as the new motu proprio states The Extraordinary Form of the Mass 'is a living form of the Roman Rite and has never ceased to be so,' Cardinal Burke noted He also could not understand why the motu proprio takes effect immediately, as the decree 'contains many elements that require study regarding its application'.\" He added that \"in his long experience he has not witnessed the 'gravely negative situation' Francis describes in his letter\" [32] He later published a statement regarding Traditionis custodes on his personal website In this statement, he called the restrictions imposed by Francis \"severe and revolutionary\", and questioned the pope's authority to revoke the practice of the Tridentine Mass [33]\n\n\nCatholic Church\nAmerican Cardinal Raymond Burke, who

revolutionary\", and questioned the pope's authority to revoke the practice of the Tridentine Mass [33]\n\n\nPope Benedict XVI\nUpon the death of Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI, the Priestly Fraternity of Saint Peter stated that the publication of Traditionis custodes had prompted Pope Benedict to send a letter of encouragement to the Fraternity [47] [48] In a 1 January 2023 interview to Die Tagespost, Benedict's former secretary Georg Gänswein stated that Benedict had read Traditionis custodes \"with pain in his heart\" [49] [50] [51] [52] In his book Nothing but the Truth, released 12 January 2022, Gänswein wrote that Benedict considered the restriction of the Tridentine mass to be \"a mistake\" since it \"jeopardized the attempt at pacification\" between the Tridentine Mass and the Mass of Paul VI; Gänswein also related that \"Benedict in particular felt it was wrong to prohibit the celebration of Mass in the ancient rite in parochial churches\" [53] [54]\n\n\nTraditionalist Catholics\nTraditionalist Catholics \"immediately decried  [Traditionis custodes] as an attack on them and the ancient liturgy\" [14] The Tablet, a British Catholic publication, reported that many traditionalist Catholics were angered by Traditionis custodes, further stating that traditionalists expressed concern that certain bishops would use the motu proprio to prohibit the Tridentine Mass within their dioceses [55]\n\n\nPublic opinion\nA September 2021 survey conducted by the Pew Research Center found that roughly two-thirds of U.S Catholics were unaware of the new restrictions Among weekly mass attending U.S Catholics, 29% disapproved of the new restrictions, 11% approved, 17% had no opinion, and 42% were unaware of them [65] [66]\n\n\nSociety of Saint Pius X\nDavide Pagliarani FSSPX, Superior General of the Society of Saint Pius X, published a letter concerning Traditionis custodes In it, he said: \"We can point out, quite logically, that the era of the hermeneutics of continuity, with its equivocations, illusions and impossible efforts, is radically over – swept aside with a wave of a sleeve These clear-cut measures do not directly affect the Society of Saint Pius X However, they must be an occasion for us to reflect deeply on the situation\" He added that \"the Tridentine Mass expresses and conveys a conception of Christian life – and consequently, a conception of the Catholic Church – that is absolutely incompatible with the ecclesiology that emerged from the Second Vatican Council\" He also stated: \"May this 'shock', provoked by the harshness of the official texts of July 16th, serve to renew, deepen and rediscover our attachment to the Tridentine Mass!\" [67] [68] [69]\n\n\nAcademics\nKurt Martens, professor of canon law at the Catholic University of America, noted that the term \"extraordinary form\" is no longer used in the new legislation and that the new motu proprio \"establishes that liturgical books promulgated in conformity with the decrees of Vatican Council II are the unique expression of the lex orandi of the Roman Rite\" He adds: \"Diocesan bishops are given broad responsibility with regard to the use of the former liturgy\" [56]\n\n\nJournalists\nPope Francis' decision was interpreted by the priest Raymond J de Souza, editor of the Convivium magazine, as more a \"sociological\" decision relating to unity in the Catholic Church than a judgement of the Tridentine Missal's spiritual qualities [72]\n\n\nImplementation\nOn 20 July 2021, the Episcopal Conference of Costa Rica stated that no Tridentine Mass would be allowed in any of their dioceses [75]\n\n\nCentral America\nOn 20 July 2021, the Episcopal Conference of Costa Rica stated that no Tridentine Mass would be allowed in any of their dioceses [75]\n\n\nUnited States\nAccording to The Pillar's review of the Latin Mass Directory, there were 657 canonically regular venues that offered a Tridentine Mass in the United States prior to Traditionis custodes, including 49 operated exclusively by the Priestly Fraternity of St Peter (FSSP) [76]\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\nIn England, the first personal parish for celebration of the Tridentine Mass had been established in 2018, three years before Traditionis custodes would prohibit further creation of such parishes The Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales did not issue a general statement regarding the celebration of the Tridentine Mass under the new regulations Certain regularly-scheduled Tridentine Masses were permanently cancelled at the behest of local bishops within the first week, while other ordinaries stated they would grant temporary permissions until they had reviewed the motu proprio [80] These restrictions to the celebration of the Tridentine Mass caused membership of the Latin Mass Society of England and Wales to increase [81]\n\n\nDesiderio desideravi\nOn 29 June 2022, the motu proprio apostolic letter Desiderio desideravi of Pope Francis was released In it, the pope states he had published Traditionis custodes because some people accepted Vatican II but rejected the liturgical reforms that followed it which had been promulgated by Paul VI and John Paul II He adds that since Sacrosanctum Concilium \"expresses the reality of the liturgy\", he had stressed in Traditionis custodes that the reformed Vatican II liturgy is \"the unique expression of the lex orandi of the Roman Rite\" He states that \"we cannot go back to that ritual form which the  [Vatican II] Council fathers .. felt the need to reform\" He wrote Traditionis custodes, he continues, because the liturgical books of Paul VI and John Paul II \"guaranteed the fidelity of the reform of the  [Vatican II] Council\", and because Francis wanted that \"the Church may lift up, in the variety of so many languages, one and the same prayer capable of expressing her unity\" He states he was determined to make it so that \"unity be re-established in the whole Church of the Roman Rite\" [82] [83] [84] [85]\n\n\nNotes\nTexts of Francis\n\n\nSee also\nTexts of Francis\n\n\nReferences\nTexts of Francis\n\n\nFurther reading\nTexts of Francis\n\n\nExternal links\nTexts

production—having previously been disregarded—by Columbia Pictures upon the success of the Williamson-written Scream,\nreleased in 1996 [9]\n\n\nDevelopment\nProducer Erik Feig pitched the idea of a screen adaptation to Mandalay Entertainment, and subsequently appointed Williamson to retool the core elements of Duncan's novel, rendering a screenplay more akin to a 1980s slasher film [5] [10] Inspired by his father, who had been a commercial fisherman, Williamson changed the setting of the novel to a small fishing village, and made the villain a hook-wielding fisherman [7]\n\n\nPre-production\nAccording to producer Stokely Chaffin, the producers sought out actors who were \"beautiful, but likable\" [10] Director Gillespie recalled that, though he had been unfamiliar with the screenplay's source material, that \"roughly 60 to 65%\" of the young women auditioning had read the novel as children [11] Jennifer Love Hewitt, who at the time was mainly known for her role on the television series Party of Five, was cast in the lead of Julie James based on her \"ability to project vulnerability\", which the producers, director Gillespie and writer Williamson unanimously agreed upon [10] Initially, Hewitt was considered for the role of Helen [10] Melissa Joan Hart was offered a role, but she turned it down, because she felt that the film was a rip-off of Scream [12] For the role of Barry, the crew had envisioned an actor with a \"6 ft 2 in (1.88 m) quarterback\" appearance, as the character had been written as an intimidating figure [10] Ryan Phillippe was ultimately cast in the part based on his audition, despite the fact that he was not as physically tall as the script had called for [10] Director Gillespie chose Freddie Prinze Jr for the role of Ray, because he felt Prinze himself had an \"everyman\" quality much like the character [10]\n\n\nFilming\nScottish director Jim Gillespie was hired to direct the film after being suggested by writer Williamson [10] Star Hewitt would later state in 2008 that Gillespie was to date her \"favorite director  [she's] ever worked with.\" [10] Principal photography began on March 31, 1997 [13] and took place over a period of ten weeks [14] throughout the late spring-early summer of 1997 [i] Approximately seven weeks of the ten-week shoot took place at night, which Gillespie says was difficult for the cast and crew, and also created commotion in primary small-town locations in which they shot [13] Gillespie devised a color scheme with cinematographer Denis Crossan which was marked by heavy blues throughout and a notable lack of bright colors [16]\n\n\nPost-production\nGillespie chose to film virtually no onscreen blood as he did not want the film to be overly gratuitous in terms of violence [13] [10] The scene in which Elsa has her throat slashed while standing against a glass door had originally been shot from behind without any blood appearing on the glass However, producer Feig worried that the scene appeared \"medically impossible\" after which Gillespie re-shot it (post-principal photography) with a visual effect of blood spattering across the glass [10] Upon test screenings of the film, Gillespie and the producers decided that a death sequence needed to occur earlier in the film to establish a sense of legitimate danger for the main characters [10] The scene in which Max is murdered in the crab factory was subsequently filmed and implemented into the final cut to achieve this (in the original script, his character was not killed) [10]\n\n\nMusic\nThe film produced two soundtracks One of them featured the score composed by John Debney, while the other contained various rock songs found in the film.\n\n\nRelease\nIn anticipation of its release, distributor Columbia Pictures began a summer marketing campaign that presented the film as being \"From the creator of Scream,\" meaning writer Kevin Williamson [13] Miramax Films subsequently filed a lawsuit against Columbia, arguing the statement was misleading as it suggested that Wes Craven, the director of Scream, had been involved with the production [13]\n\n\nMarketing and lawsuit\nIn

directed by Jim Gillespie. The film stars Jennifer Love Hewitt, Freddie Prinze Jr., Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillippe, and Bridgette Wilson.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film is set in the summer of 1996 in the small coastal town of Southport, North Carolina. Julie James (Jennifer Love Hewitt) and her friends Ray Bronson (Freddie Prinze Jr.), Helen Shivers (Sarah Michelle Gellar), and Barry Cox (Ryan Phillippe) are driving home from a party on July 4th when they accidentally hit and kill a pedestrian, who is revealed to be a fisherman named Ben Willis. To avoid reporting the incident and facing the consequences, the group decides to dump the body in the water. However, the pedestrian wakes up and grabs Helen, and Barry pushes him into the water, where he presumably drowns.\n\nThe group swears to never discuss what happened, but they are haunted by the incident and begin to receive threatening messages and phone calls, hinting that the pedestrian may not be dead. As the summer progresses, the group's relationships begin to fray, and they start to turn on each other, suspecting that one of their own may be responsible for the threatening messages.\n\n**Cast**\n\nThe film features a talented young cast, including Jennifer Love Hewitt, Freddie Prinze Jr., Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillippe, and Bridgette Wilson. The cast brought a fresh and youthful energy to the film, which helped to make it a commercial success.\n\n**Production**\n\nThe film was written by Kevin Williamson, who is also known for writing the screenplay for the successful film Scream. The screenplay for I Know What You Did Last Summer was rushed into production after the success of Scream, and the film was made on a relatively low budget of $17 million. Despite the low budget, the film's success was a major surprise, and it went on to gross over $126 million worldwide.\n\n**Development and Writing**\n\nThe film's development began when producer Erik Feig pitched the idea of a screen adaptation to Mandalay Entertainment. Feig appointed Williamson to retool the core elements of Duncan's novel, rendering a screenplay more akin to a 1980s slasher film. Williamson was inspired by his father, who had been a commercial fisherman, and changed the setting of the novel to a small fishing village, making the villain a hook-wielding fisherman.\n\n**Pre-production**\n\nThe producers sought out actors who were \"beautiful, but likable,\" according to producer Stokely Chaffin. Director Gillespie recalled that, though he had been unfamiliar with the screenplay's source material, that \"roughly 60 to 65%\" of the young women auditioning had read the novel as children. Jennifer Love Hewitt was cast in the lead role of Julie James based on her \"ability to project vulnerability,\" which the producers, director Gillespie, and writer Williamson unanimously agreed upon.\n\n**Filming**\n\nPrincipal photography began on March 31, 1997, and took place over a period of ten weeks throughout the late spring-early summer of 1997. Approximately seven weeks of the ten-week shoot took place at night, which Gillespie says was difficult for the cast and crew, and also created commotion in primary small-town locations in which they shot. Gillespie devised a color scheme with cinematographer Denis Crossan, which was marked by heavy blues throughout and a notable lack of bright colors.\n\n**Post-production**\n\nGillespie chose to film virtually no on-screen blood as he did not want the film to be overly gratuitous in terms of violence. The scene in which Elsa has her throat slashed while standing against a glass door had originally been shot from behind without any blood appearing on the glass. However, producer Feig worried that the scene appeared \"medically impossible,\" after which Gillespie re-shot it (post-principal photography) with a visual effect of blood spattering across the glass.\n\n**Music**\n\nThe film produced two soundtracks. One of them featured the score composed by John Debney, while the other contained various rock songs found in the film.\n\n**Release**\n\nIn anticipation of its release, distributor Columbia Pictures began a summer marketing campaign that presented the film as being \"From the creator of Scream,\" meaning writer Kevin Williamson. Miramax Films subsequently filed a lawsuit against Columbia, arguing the statement was misleading as it suggested that Wes Craven, the director of Scream, had been involved with the production.\n\n**Marketing and Lawsuit**\n\nThe lawsuit was eventually settled out of court, and the film was released on October 17, 1997. The film's marketing campaign was a major success, and it went on to gross over $126 million worldwide.\n\n**Home Media**\n\nThe film was released on VHS and DVD by Columbia TriStar Home Video in the US on June 16, 1998. Special features included a theatrical trailer and the filmmaker's commentary.\n\n**Reception**\n\nI Know What You Did Last Summer opened theatrically in North America on October 17, 1997. The film had been made on a $17 million budget, yet already in its opening weekend it grossed $15,818,645 in 2,524 theaters in the United States and Canada, ranking number one; it remained in the number one position for an additional two weekends. By the end of its theatrical run in December 1997, it had grossed $72,586,134 in the U.S and Canada and $53 million in other countries for a worldwide total of $126 million.\n\n**Box Office**\n\nThe film was a major commercial success, grossing over $126 million worldwide. The film's success was a major surprise, and it helped to establish the slasher genre as a major force in the film industry.\n\n**Critical Response**\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 46% based on 78 reviews, with an average rating of 5.4 out of 10. The site's critics consensus reads: \"A by-the-numbers slasher that arrived a decade too late, the mostly tedious I Know What You Did Last Summer will likely only hook diehard fans of the genre.\" On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 52 out of 100 based on reviews from 17 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews.\"\n\n**Accolades**\n\nA sequel titled I Still Know What You Did Last Summer was released in 1998, with a direct-to-video film, I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer, released in 2006. In the first sequel, Love Hewitt, Prinze Jr, and Watson reprise their roles. The third film has very little relation to the first two, other than the premise, the villain, and the producers. It featured new characters and a different setting.\n\n**Sequels**\n\nThe film's success spawned two sequels, both of which were released to mixed reviews. I Still Know What You Did Last Summer was released in 1998 and grossed over $39 million worldwide. I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer was released in 2006 and grossed over $1 million worldwide.\n\n**Remakes**\n\nThe film was unofficially remade in India by Anil V Kumar as Kucch To Hai (2003), starring Tusshar Kapoor. However, in an interview to Hindustan Times, Kapoor denied that the makers of his film copied this particular film.\n\n**Television Adaptation**\n\nA television series adaptation of the novel was released in October 2021, with Neal H Moritz and James Wan producing and Shay Hatten writing the pilot. Amazon ordered a straight-to-series order in October 2020.\n\n**In Popular Culture**\n\nThe Dawson's Creek season one episode \"The Scare\" spoofs I Know What You Did Last Summer alongside Scream, all written by Williamson.

producers sought out actors who were \"beautiful, but likable\" [10] Director Gillespie recalled that, though he had been unfamiliar with the screenplay's source material, that \"roughly 60 to 65%\" of the young women auditioning had read the novel as children [11] Jennifer Love Hewitt, who at the time was mainly known for her role on the television series Party of Five, was cast in the lead of Julie James based on her \"ability to project vulnerability\", which the producers, director Gillespie and writer Williamson unanimously agreed upon [10] Initially, Hewitt was considered for the role of Helen [10] Melissa Joan Hart was offered a role, but she turned it down, because she felt that the film was a rip-off of Scream [12] For the role of Barry, the crew had envisioned an actor with a \"6 ft 2 in (1.88 m) quarterback\" appearance, as the character had been written as an intimidating figure [10] Ryan Phillippe was ultimately cast in the part based on his audition, despite the fact that he was not as physically tall as the script had called for [10] Director Gillespie chose Freddie Prinze Jr for the role of Ray, because he felt Prinze himself had an \"everyman\" quality much like the character [10]\n\n\nFilming\nScottish director Jim Gillespie was hired to direct the film after being suggested by writer Williamson [10] Star Hewitt would later state in 2008 that Gillespie was to date her \"favorite director  [she's] ever worked with.\" [10] Principal photography began on March 31, 1997 [13] and took place over a period of ten weeks [14] throughout the late spring-early

impossible\" after which Gillespie re-shot it (post-principal photography) with a visual effect of blood spattering across the glass [10] Upon test screenings of the film, Gillespie and the producers decided that a death sequence needed to occur earlier in the film to establish a sense of legitimate danger for the main characters [10] The scene in which Max is murdered in the crab factory was subsequently filmed and implemented into the final cut to achieve this (in the original script, his character was not killed) [10]\n\n\nMusic\nThe film produced two soundtracks One of them featured

responded to the mass shootings by discussing the need for gun reform legislation [118]\n\n\nChanges to Colorado's gun laws\nThe shooting led to the passage of gun reform legislation in the Colorado General Assembly [132] [133] On April 20, Governor Jared Polis signed two gun control bills into law One requires gun owners to report lost or stolen firearms within five days or be fined The other is

only prohibit weapons purchases for those convicted of a felony, or a misdemeanor with a prison term of over 24 months [2] [14] [55] [74] [109] He was reported to be carrying a 9 mm handgun in addition to his primary weapon [50]\n\n\nGovernment and public discussion\nAt the national level, President Joe Biden called for an immediate ban on assault weapons; other Democratic politicians echoed his sentiments, including U.S Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, U.S Representative Joe Neguse of Colorado, and former President Barack Obama [115] [116] Biden also urged that loopholes be

to the cars they were using [11]\n\n\nFormula Ford\nHunt graduated to Formula Ford in 1968 He drove a Russell-Alexis Mark 14 car bought through a hire-purchase scheme In his first race at Snetterton, Hunt had lost 15 hp from an incorrect engine ignition setting, but managed to finish fifth Hunt took his first win at Lydden Hill and also set the lap record on the Brands Hatch short circuit [12]\n\n\nFormula Three\nIn 1969, Hunt raced in Formula Three with a budget, provided by Gowrings of Reading, which bought a Merlyn Mark 11A Gowrings intended to run the car in the final two races of 1968 [12] Hunt won several races and achieved regular high-placed finishes, which led to the British Guild of Motoring Writers awarding him a Grovewood Award as one of the three drivers judged to have promising careers [13]\n\n\nFormula One career\nHesketh purchased a March 731 chassis, and it was developed by Harvey Postlethwaite The team was initially not taken seriously by rivals, who saw the Hesketh team as party goers enjoying the glamour of Formula One [Note 1] However, the Hesketh March proved much more competitive than the works March cars, and their best result was second place at the 1973 United States Grand Prix Hunt also made a brief venture into sports car racing at the 1973 Kyalami Nine Hours, driving a Mirage M6 along with Derek Bell, finishing second [22]\n\n\n1973–1975:

made a brief venture into sports car racing at the 1973 Kyalami Nine Hours, driving a Mirage M6 along with Derek Bell, finishing second [22]\n\n\n1976–1978: McLaren\nThe season proved to be one of the most dramatic and controversial on record While Hunt's performances in the Hesketh had drawn considerable praise, there was some speculation as to whether he could really sustain a championship challenge Now a works McLaren driver, he dispelled many doubters at the first race in Brazil, where, in a hastily rebuilt McLaren M23, he landed pole position in the last minutes of qualifying Over the course of the year he would drive the McLaren M23 to six Grands Prix wins, but with superior reliability reigning world champion and main rival Niki Lauda had pulled out a substantial points lead in the first few races of the season Hunt's first race win of 1976, at the fourth race of the season, the Spanish Grand Prix, resulted in disqualification for driving a car adjudged to be 1.8 cm too wide The win was later reinstated upon appeal, but it set the tone for an extraordinarily volatile season At the British Grand Prix, Hunt was involved in a first corner incident on the first lap with Lauda which led to the race being stopped and restarted Hunt initially attempted to take a spare car, however this was disallowed, and during this time the original race car was repaired, eventually winning the restarted race [29] Hunt's victory was disallowed on 24 September by a ruling from the FIA after Ferrari complained that Hunt was not legally allowed to restart the race [30]\n\n\n1979: Walter Wolf Racing\nFor 1979,  Hunt had resolved to leave the McLaren team Despite his poor season in 1978 he was still very much in demand Harvey Postlethwaite persuaded Hunt to join Walter Wolf Racing – a one-car team where he would have found an atmosphere similar to the one he had experienced at Hesketh at the beginning of his career Again he had high hopes to win races and compete for the world championship in what would be his last, and ultimately brief, Formula One season The team's ground effect car was uncompetitive and Hunt soon lost any enthusiasm for racing [45] Hunt could only watch as Jody Scheckter won the World Drivers' Championship that year driving the Ferrari 312T4.\n\n\nLater career (1979–1993)\nSoon after retirement, in 1979, Hunt was approached by Jonathan Martin, the head of BBC television sport, to become a television commentator alongside Murray Walker on the BBC 2 Formula One racing programme Grand Prix After a guest commentary at the 1979 British Grand Prix, Hunt accepted the position and continued for thirteen years until his death During his first live broadcast at the 1980 Monaco Grand Prix, Hunt placed his plaster-cast leg into Walker's lap and drank two bottles of wine during the broadcast [49] [50] Hunt regularly went into the booth minutes before a race started, which concerned Martin, who believed that Hunt was \"a guy that lived on adrenaline.\" [51]\n\n\nCommentary career\nSoon after retirement, in 1979, Hunt was approached by Jonathan Martin, the head of BBC television sport, to become a television commentator alongside Murray

McLaren at the United States Grand Prix West, asking for $1 million for the race This opportunity came about when regular driver Alain Prost broke his wrist during practice for the previous round in South Africa, and the French rookie was not fully fit to drive at Long Beach The team's main sponsor, Marlboro, offered half the figure but negotiations ended after Hunt broke his leg while skiing In 1982 Bernie Ecclestone, owner of the Brabham team, offered Hunt a salary of £2.6 million for the season but was rejected by Hunt In 1990, Hunt was in financial trouble with the loss of £180,000 investing in Lloyd's of London [61] and considered a comeback with the Williams team He had tested on the Paul Ricard Circuit a few months prior to test modern cars and was several seconds off the pace and believed he would be physically prepared Hunt attempted to persuade John Hogan, VP Marketing of Philip Morris Europe, [62] to support the possible comeback, and presented him with bank statement for proof of being indebted [63]\n\n\nOther projects\nHunt made a brief appearance in the 1979 British silent slapstick comedy The Plank, as well as co-starring with Fred Emney in a Texaco Havoline TV advertisement He also made a posthumous appearance on ITV's Police Camera Action! special Crash Test Racers in 2000; this was one of many interviews to be aired posthumously Hunt also competed in an exhibition race to mark the opening of the new Nürburgring in May 1984 [64] Despite having no licence to ride a motorcycle, he accepted, instead of his usual fee, the then-new 1980 electric start Triumph Bonneville he had contracted to advertise on behalf of the struggling Triumph motorcycle workers' co-operative With journalistic mirth, he turned up at the press launch with his foot in plaster [65]\n\n\nPersonal life\nEarly in their careers, Hunt and Niki Lauda were friends off the track Lauda occasionally stayed at Hunt's flat when he had nowhere to sleep for the night In his autobiography To Hell and Back, Lauda described Hunt as an \"open, honest to God pal.\" Lauda admired Hunt's burst of speed, while Hunt admired Lauda's capacity for analysis and rigour [66] In the spring of 1974, Hunt moved to Spain on the advice of the International Management Group [67] Whilst living there as a tax exile, Hunt was the neighbour of Jody Scheckter, and they also came to be very good friends, with Hunt giving Scheckter the nickname Fletcher after the crash-prone bird in the book Jonathan Livingston Seagull Another close friend was Ronnie Peterson who was a quiet and shy man, whilst Hunt was the opposite, but their contrasting personalities made them very close off the track It was Hunt who discovered Gilles Villeneuve, whom he met after being soundly beaten by him in a Formula Atlantic race in 1976 Hunt then arranged for the young Canadian to make his Grand Prix debut with McLaren in 1977.\n\n\nDeath\nHunt died in his sleep on the morning of 15 June 1993 of a heart attack at his home in Wimbledon [76] [77] He was 45 years old.\n\n\nLegacy\nHunt was known as a fast driver with an aggressive, tail-happy driving style, but one prone to spectacular accidents, hence his nickname of Hunt the Shunt In reality, while Hunt was not necessarily any more accident-prone than his rivals in the lower formulae, the rhyme stuck and stayed with him In the book James Hunt: The Biography, John Hogan said of Hunt: \"James was the only driver I've ever seen who had the vaguest idea about what it actually takes to be a racing driver.\" [51] Niki Lauda stated that \"We were big rivals, especially at the end of the  [1976] season, but I respected him because you could drive next to him—2 centimetres, wheel-by-wheel, for 300 kilometres or more—and nothing would happen He was a real top driver at the time.\" [79]\n\n\nHelmet\nHunt's helmet featured his name in bold letters along with blue, yellow and red stripes on both sides and room for the sponsor Goodyear, all set on a black background [83] Additionally, the blue, yellow and red bands resemble his Wellington College school colours [84] During his comeback year to Formula One in 2012, 2007 World Champion Kimi Räikkönen sported a helmet with the James Hunt's name printed on it during the Monaco Grand Prix [85] Räikkönen repeated the tribute at the 2013 Monaco Grand Prix [86]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nThe 1976 F1 battle between Niki Lauda and James Hunt was dramatised in the 2013 film Rush, in which Hunt was played by Chris Hemsworth In the film, Lauda said of Hunt's death, \"When I heard he'd died aged 45 of a heart attack I wasn't surprised, I was just sad\" He also said that Hunt was one of the very few people he liked, a smaller number he respected and the only one he had envied

in the first few races of the season Hunt's first race win of 1976, at the fourth race of the season, the Spanish Grand Prix, resulted in disqualification for driving a car adjudged to be 1.8 cm too wide The win was later reinstated upon appeal, but it set the tone for an extraordinarily volatile season At the British Grand Prix, Hunt was involved in a first corner incident on the first lap with Lauda which led to the race being stopped and restarted Hunt initially attempted to take a spare car, however this was disallowed, and during this time the original race car was repaired, eventually winning the restarted race [29] Hunt's victory was disallowed on 24 September by a ruling from the FIA after Ferrari complained that Hunt was not legally allowed to restart the race [30]\n\n\n1979: Walter Wolf Racing\nFor 1979,  Hunt had resolved to leave the McLaren team Despite his poor season in 1978 he was still very much in demand Harvey Postlethwaite persuaded Hunt to join Walter Wolf Racing – a one-car team where he would have found an atmosphere similar to the one he had experienced at Hesketh at the beginning of his career Again he had high hopes to win races and compete for the world championship in what would be his last, and ultimately brief, Formula One season The team's ground effect car was uncompetitive and Hunt soon lost any enthusiasm for racing [45] Hunt could only watch as Jody Scheckter won the World Drivers' Championship that year driving the Ferrari 312T4.\n\n\nLater career (1979–1993)\nSoon after retirement, in 1979, Hunt was approached by Jonathan Martin, the head of BBC television sport, to become a television commentator alongside Murray Walker on the BBC 2 Formula One racing programme Grand Prix After a guest commentary at the 1979 British Grand Prix, Hunt accepted the position and continued for thirteen years until his death During his first live broadcast at the 1980 Monaco Grand Prix, Hunt placed his plaster-cast leg into Walker's lap and drank two bottles of wine during the broadcast [49] [50] Hunt regularly went into the booth minutes before a race started, which concerned Martin, who believed that Hunt was \"a guy that lived on adrenaline.\" [51]\n\n\nCommentary career\nSoon after retirement, in 1979, Hunt was approached by Jonathan Martin, the head of BBC television sport, to become a television commentator alongside Murray Walker on the BBC 2 Formula One racing programme Grand Prix After a guest commentary at the 1979 British Grand Prix, Hunt accepted the position and continued for thirteen years until his death During

booth minutes before a race started, which concerned Martin, who believed that Hunt was \"a guy that lived on adrenaline.\" [51]\n\n\nAttempted comebacks\nIn 1980, Hunt nearly made a comeback with McLaren at the United States Grand Prix West, asking for $1 million for the race This opportunity came about when regular driver Alain Prost broke his wrist during practice for the previous round in South Africa, and the French rookie was not fully fit to drive at Long Beach The team's main sponsor, Marlboro, offered half the figure but negotiations ended after Hunt broke his leg while skiing In 1982 Bernie Ecclestone, owner of the Brabham team, offered Hunt a salary of £2.6 million for the season but was rejected by Hunt In 1990, Hunt was in financial trouble with the loss of £180,000 investing in Lloyd's of London [61] and considered a comeback with the Williams team He had tested on the Paul Ricard Circuit a few months prior to test modern cars and was several seconds off the pace and believed he would be physically prepared Hunt attempted to persuade John Hogan, VP Marketing of Philip Morris Europe, [62] to support the possible comeback, and presented him with bank statement for proof of being indebted [63]\n\n\nOther projects\nHunt made a brief appearance in the 1979 British silent slapstick comedy The Plank, as well as co-starring with Fred Emney in a Texaco Havoline TV advertisement He also made a posthumous appearance on ITV's Police Camera Action! special Crash Test Racers in 2000; this was one of many interviews to be aired posthumously Hunt also competed in an exhibition race to mark the opening of the new Nürburgring in May 1984 [64] Despite having no licence to ride a motorcycle, he accepted, instead of his usual fee, the then-new 1980 electric start Triumph Bonneville he had contracted to advertise on behalf of the struggling Triumph motorcycle workers' co-operative With journalistic mirth, he turned up at the press launch with his foot in plaster [65]\n\n\nPersonal life\nEarly in their careers, Hunt and Niki Lauda were friends off the track Lauda occasionally stayed at Hunt's flat when he had nowhere to sleep for the night In his autobiography To Hell and Back, Lauda described Hunt as an \"open, honest to God pal.\" Lauda admired Hunt's burst of speed, while Hunt admired Lauda's capacity for analysis and rigour [66] In the spring of 1974, Hunt moved to Spain on the advice of the International Management Group [67] Whilst living there as a tax exile, Hunt was the neighbour of Jody Scheckter, and they also came to be very good friends, with Hunt giving Scheckter the nickname Fletcher after the crash-prone bird in the book Jonathan Livingston Seagull Another close friend was Ronnie Peterson who was a quiet and shy man, whilst Hunt was the opposite, but their contrasting personalities made them very close off the track It was Hunt who discovered Gilles Villeneuve, whom he met after being soundly beaten by him in a Formula Atlantic race in 1976 Hunt then arranged for the young Canadian to make his Grand Prix debut with McLaren in 1977.\n\n\nDeath\nHunt died in his sleep on the morning of 15 June 1993 of a heart attack at his home in Wimbledon [76] [77] He was 45 years old.\n\n\nLegacy\nHunt was known as a fast driver with an aggressive, tail-happy driving style, but one prone to spectacular accidents, hence his nickname of Hunt the Shunt In reality, while Hunt was not necessarily any more accident-prone than his rivals in the lower formulae, the rhyme stuck and stayed with him In the book James Hunt: The Biography, John Hogan said of Hunt: \"James was the only driver I've ever seen who had the vaguest idea about what it actually takes to be a racing driver.\" [51] Niki Lauda stated that \"We were big rivals, especially at the end of the  [1976] season, but I respected him because you could drive next to him—2 centimetres, wheel-by-wheel, for 300 kilometres or more—and nothing would happen He was a real top driver at the time.\" [79]\n\n\nHelmet\nHunt's helmet featured his name in bold letters along with blue, yellow and red stripes on both sides and room for the sponsor Goodyear, all set on a black background [83] Additionally, the blue, yellow and red bands resemble his Wellington College school colours [84] During his comeback year to Formula One in 2012, 2007 World Champion Kimi Räikkönen sported a helmet with the James Hunt's name printed on it during the Monaco Grand Prix [85] Räikkönen repeated the tribute at the 2013 Monaco Grand Prix [86]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nThe 1976 F1 battle between Niki Lauda and James Hunt was dramatised in the 2013 film Rush, in which Hunt was played by Chris Hemsworth In the film, Lauda said of Hunt's death, \"When I heard he'd died aged 45 of a heart attack I wasn't surprised, I was just sad\" He also said that Hunt was one of the very few people he liked, a smaller number he respected and the only one he had envied

{"title": "MacOS", "content": "\nHistory\nThe heritage of what would become macOS had originated at NeXT, a company founded by Steve Jobs following his departure from Apple in 1985 There, the Unix-like NeXTSTEP operating system was developed, before being launched in 1989 The kernel of NeXTSTEP is based upon the Mach kernel, which was originally developed at Carnegie Mellon University, with additional kernel layers and low-level user space code derived from parts of FreeBSD [12] and other BSD operating systems [13] Its graphical user interface was built on top of an object-oriented GUI toolkit using the Objective-C programming language.\n\n\nDevelopment\nThe heritage of what would become macOS had originated at NeXT, a company founded by Steve Jobs following his departure from

Carnegie Mellon University, with additional kernel layers and low-level user space code derived from parts of FreeBSD [12] and other BSD operating systems [13] Its graphical user interface was built on top of an object-oriented GUI toolkit using the Objective-C programming language.\n\n\nMac OS X\nThe letter \"X\" in Mac OS X's name refers to the number 10, a Roman numeral, and Apple has stated that it should be pronounced \"ten\" in this context However, it is also commonly pronounced like the letter \"X\" [18] [19] The iPhone X, iPhone XR and iPhone XS all later followed this convention.\n\n\nOS X\nIn 2012, with the release of OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion, the name of the system was officially shortened from Mac OS X to OS X, after the previous version shortened the system name in a similar fashion a year prior That year, Apple removed the head of OS X development, Scott Forstall, and design was changed towards a more minimal direction [41] Apple's new user interface design, using deep color saturation, text-only buttons and a minimal, 'flat' interface, was debuted with iOS 7 in 2013 With OS X engineers reportedly working on iOS 7, the version released in 2013, OS X 10.9 Mavericks, was something of a transitional release, with some of the skeuomorphic design removed, while most of the general interface of Mavericks remained unchanged [42] The next version, OS X 10.10 Yosemite, adopted a design similar to iOS 7 but with greater complexity suitable for an interface controlled with a mouse [43]\n\n\nmacOS\nIn 2016, with the release of macOS 10.12 Sierra, the name was changed from OS X to macOS with the purpose of aligning it with the branding of Apple's other primary operating systems: iOS, watchOS, and tvOS [47] [48] macOS Sierra added Siri, iCloud Drive, picture-in-picture support, a Night Shift mode that switches the display to warmer colors at night, and two Continuity features: Universal Clipboard, which syncs a user's clipboard across their Apple devices, and Auto Unlock, which can unlock a user's Mac with their Apple Watch macOS Sierra also adds support for the Apple File System (APFS), Apple's successor to the dated HFS+ file system [49] [50] [51] macOS 10.13 High Sierra, released in 2017, included performance improvements, Metal 2 and HEVC support, and made APFS the default file system for SSD boot drives [52]\n\n\nTimeline of releases\n\n\n\nArchitecture\nAt macOS's core is a POSIX-compliant operating system built on top of the XNU kernel, [79] (which incorporated large parts of FreeBSD kernel [12]) and FreeBSD userland [12] for the standard Unix facilities available from the command line interface Apple has released this family of software as a free and open source operating system named Darwin On top of Darwin, Apple layered a number of components, including the Aqua interface and the Finder, to complete the GUI-based operating system which is macOS [80]\n\n\nSoftware compatibility\nApple offered two main APIs to develop software natively for macOS: Cocoa and Carbon Cocoa was a descendant of APIs inherited from OPENSTEP with no ancestry from the classic Mac OS, while Carbon was an adaptation of classic Mac OS APIs, allowing Mac software to be minimally rewritten to run natively on Mac OS X [17]\n\n\nHardware compatibility\nList of macOS versions, the supported systems on which they run, and their RAM requirements\n\n\nPowerPC–Intel transition\nIn April 2002, eWeek announced a rumor that Apple had a version of Mac OS X code-named Marklar, which ran on Intel x86 processors The idea behind Marklar was to keep Mac OS X running on an alternative platform should Apple become dissatisfied with the progress of the PowerPC platform [122] These rumors subsided until late in May 2005, when various media outlets, such as The Wall Street Journal [123] and CNET, [124] announced that Apple would unveil Marklar in the coming months [125] [126] [127]\n\n\nIntel–Apple silicon transition\nRumors of Apple shifting Macs from Intel to in-house ARM processors used by iOS devices began circulating as early as 2011, [135] and ebbed and flowed throughout the 2010s [136] Rumors intensified in 2020, when numerous reports announced that the company would announce its shift to its custom processors at WWDC [137]\n\n\nFeatures\nOne of the major differences between the classic Mac OS and the current macOS was the addition of Aqua, a graphical user interface with water-like elements, in the first major release of Mac OS X Every window element, text, graphic, or widget is drawn on-screen using spatial anti-aliasing technology [140] ColorSync, a technology introduced many years before, was improved and built into the core drawing engine, to provide color matching for printing and multimedia professionals [141] Also, drop shadows were added around windows and isolated text elements to provide a sense of depth New interface elements were integrated, including sheets (dialog boxes attached to specific windows) and drawers, which would slide out and provide options.\n\n\nAqua user interface\nOne of the major differences between the classic Mac OS and the current macOS was the addition of Aqua, a graphical user interface with water-like elements, in the first major release of Mac OS X Every window element, text, graphic, or widget is drawn on-screen using spatial anti-aliasing technology [140] ColorSync, a technology introduced many years before, was improved and built into the core drawing engine, to provide color matching for printing and multimedia professionals [141] Also, drop shadows were added around windows and isolated text elements to provide a sense of depth New interface elements were integrated, including sheets (dialog boxes attached to specific windows) and drawers, which would slide out and provide options.\n\n\nBuilt-in components\nThe Finder is a file browser allowing quick access to all areas of the computer, which has been modified throughout subsequent releases of macOS [152] [153] Quick Look has been part of the Finder since version 10.5 It allows for dynamic previews of files, including videos and multi-page documents without opening any other applications Spotlight, a file searching technology which has been integrated into the Finder since version 10.4, allows rapid real-time searches of data files; mail messages; photos; and other information based on item properties (metadata) or content [154] [155] macOS makes use of a Dock, which holds file and folder shortcuts as well as minimized windows.\n\n\nMultilingual support\nThere are 47 system languages available in macOS for the user at the moment of installation; the system language is used throughout the entire operating system environment [170] Input methods for typing in dozens of scripts can be chosen independently of the system language [171] Recent updates have added increased support for Chinese characters and interconnections with popular social networks in China [172] [173] [174] [175]\n\n\nUpdating methods\n\n\n\nRelease history\nMac OS X versions were named after big cats, with the exception of Mac OS X Server 1.0 and the original public beta, from Mac OS X 10.0 until OS X 10.9 Mavericks, when Apple switched to using California locations Prior to its release, version 10.0 was code named internally at Apple as \"Cheetah\", and Mac OS X 10.1 was code named internally as \"Puma\" After the immense buzz surrounding Mac OS X 10.2, codenamed \"Jaguar\", Apple's product marketing began openly using the code names to promote the operating system Mac OS X 10.3 was marketed as \"Panther\", Mac OS X 10.4 as \"Tiger\", Mac OS X 10.5 as \"Leopard\", Mac OS X 10.6 as \"Snow Leopard\", Mac OS X 10.7 as \"Lion\", OS X 10.8 as \"Mountain Lion\", and OS X 10.9 as \"Mavericks\".\n\n\nMac OS X Public Beta\nOn September 13, 2000, Apple released a US$29.95 [183] \"preview\" version of Mac OS X, internally codenamed Kodiak, to gain feedback from users.\n\n\nMac OS X 10.0\nOn March 24, 2001, Apple released Mac OS X 10.0 (internally codenamed Cheetah) [185]\nThe initial version was slow, [186] incomplete, [187] and had very few applications available at launch, mostly from independent developers [188] While many critics suggested that the operating system was not ready for mainstream adoption, they recognized the importance of its initial launch as a base on which to improve [187] Simply releasing Mac OS X was received by the Macintosh community as a great accomplishment, [187] for attempts to overhaul the Mac OS had been underway since 1996, and delayed by countless setbacks.\n\n\nMac OS X 10.1\nLater that year, on September 25, 2001, Mac OS X 10.1 (internally codenamed Puma) was released It featured increased performance and provided missing features, such as DVD playback Apple released 10.1 as a free upgrade CD for 10.0 users, in addition to the $129 boxed version for people running Mac OS 9 It was discovered that the upgrade CDs were full install CDs that could be used with Mac OS 9 systems by removing a specific file; Apple later re-released the CDs in an actual stripped-down format that did not facilitate installation on such systems [189] On January 7, 2002, Apple announced that Mac OS X was to be the default operating system for all Macintosh products by the end of that month [190]\n\n\nMac OS X 10.2 Jaguar\nOn August 23, 2002, [191] Apple followed up with Mac OS X 10.2 Jaguar, the first release to use its code name as part of the branding [192]\nIt brought significant performance improvements, and an updated version of Aqua's visual design Jaguar also included over 150 [193] new user-facing features, including Quartz Extreme for compositing graphics directly on an ATI Radeon or Nvidia GeForce2 MX AGP-based video card with at least 16 MB of VRAM, a system-wide repository for contact information in the new Address Book, and the iChat instant messaging client [194] The Happy Mac icon — which had appeared during the Mac OS startup sequence since the original Macintosh — was replaced with a grey Apple logo [195]\n\n\nMac OS X 10.3 Panther\nMac OS X v10.3 Panther was released on October 24, 2003 It significantly improved performance and incorporated the most extensive update yet to the user interface Panther included as many or more new features as Jaguar had the year before, including an updated Finder, incorporating a brushed-metal interface, Fast user switching, Exposé (Window manager), FileVault, Safari, iChat AV (which added video conferencing features to iChat), improved Portable Document Format (PDF) rendering and much greater Microsoft Windows interoperability [196] Support for some early G3 computers such as \"beige\" Power Macs and \"WallStreet\" PowerBooks was discontinued [197]\n\n\nMac OS X 10.4 Tiger\nMac OS X 10.4 Tiger was released on April 29, 2005 Apple stated that Tiger contained more than 200 new features [198] As with Panther, certain older machines were no longer supported; Tiger requires a Mac with 256 MB and a built-in FireWire port [113] Among the new features, Tiger introduced Spotlight, Dashboard, Smart Folders, updated Mail program with Smart Mailboxes, QuickTime 7, Safari 2, Automator, VoiceOver, Core Image and Core Video The initial release of the Apple TV used a modified version of Tiger with a different graphical interface and fewer applications and services [199] On January 10, 2006, Apple released the first Intel-based Macs along with the 10.4.4 update to Tiger This operating system functioned identically on the PowerPC-based Macs and the new Intel-based machines, with the exception of the Intel release lacking support for the Classic environment [200]\n\n\nMac OS X 10.5 Leopard\nMac OS X 10.5 Leopard was released on October 26, 2007 It was called by Apple \"the largest update of Mac OS X\" It brought more than 300 new features [201] Leopard supports both PowerPC- and Intel x86-based Macintosh computers; support for the G3 processor was dropped and the G4 processor required a minimum clock rate of 867 MHz, and at least 512 MB of RAM to be installed The single DVD works for all supported Macs (including 64-bit machines) New features include a new look, an updated Finder, Time Machine, Spaces, Boot Camp pre-installed, [202] full support for 64-bit applications (including graphical applications), new features in Mail and iChat, and a number of new security features Leopard is an Open Brand UNIX 03 registered product on the Intel platform It was also the first BSD-based OS to receive UNIX 03 certification [203] [204] Leopard dropped support for the Classic Environment and all Classic applications [205] It was the final version of Mac OS X to support the PowerPC architecture [206]\n\n\nMac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard\nMac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard was released on August 28, 2009 Rather than delivering big changes to the appearance and end user functionality like the previous releases of Mac OS X, Snow Leopard focused on \"under the hood\" changes, increasing the performance, efficiency, and stability of the operating system For most users, the most noticeable changes were: the disk space that the operating system frees up after a clean install compared to Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard, a more responsive Finder rewritten in Cocoa, faster Time Machine backups, more reliable and user-friendly disk ejects, a more powerful version of the Preview application, as well as a faster Safari web browser Snow Leopard only supported machines with Intel CPUs, required at least 1 GB of RAM, and dropped default support for applications built for the PowerPC architecture (Rosetta could be installed as an additional component to retain support for PowerPC-only applications) [207]\n\n\nOS X 10.7 Lion\nOS X 10.7 Lion was released on July 20, 2011 It brought developments made in Apple's iOS, such as an easily navigable display of installed applications called Launchpad and a greater use of multi-touch gestures, to the Mac This release removed Rosetta, making it incompatible with PowerPC applications [134]\n\n\nOS X 10.8 Mountain Lion\nOS X 10.8 Mountain Lion was released on July 25, 2012 [72] Following the release of Lion the previous year, it was the first of the annual rather than two-yearly updates to OS X (and later macOS), which also closely aligned with the annual iOS operating system updates It incorporates some features seen in iOS 5, which include Game Center, support for iMessage in the new Messages messaging application, and Reminders as a to-do list app separate from iCal (which is renamed as Calendar, like the iOS app) It also includes support for storing iWork documents in iCloud [212] Notification Center, which makes its debut in Mountain Lion, is a desktop version similar to the one in iOS 5.0 and higher Application pop-ups are now concentrated on the corner of the screen, and the Center itself is pulled from the right side of the screen Mountain Lion also includes more Chinese features including support for Baidu as an option for Safari search engine, QQ, 163.com and 126.com services for Mail, Contacts and Calendar, Youku, Tudou and Sina Weibo are integrated into share sheets [175]\n\n\nOS X 10.9 Mavericks\nOS X 10.9 Mavericks was released on October 22, 2013 It was a free upgrade to all users running Snow Leopard or later with a 64-bit Intel processor [215] Its changes include the addition of the previously iOS-only Maps and iBooks applications, improvements to the Notification Center, enhancements to several applications, and many under-the-hood improvements [216]\n\n\nOS X 10.10 Yosemite\nOS X 10.10 Yosemite was released on October 16, 2014 It features a redesigned user interface similar to that of iOS 7, intended to feature a more minimal, text-based 'flat' design, with use of translucency effects and intensely saturated colors [217] Apple's showcase new feature in Yosemite is Handoff, which enables users with iPhones running iOS 8.1 or later to answer phone calls, receive and send SMS messages, and complete unfinished iPhone emails on their Mac As of OS X 10.10.3, Photos replaced iPhoto and Aperture [218]\n\n\nOS X 10.11 El Capitan\nOS X 10.11 El Capitan was released on September 30, 2015 Similar to Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard, Apple described this release as emphasizing \"refinements to the Mac experience\" and \"improvements to system performance\" [219] Refinements include public transport built into the Maps application, GUI improvements to the Notes application, adopting San Francisco as the system font for clearer legibility, and the introduction of System Integrity Protection.\n\n\nmacOS 10.12 Sierra\nmacOS 10.12 Sierra was released to the public on September 20, 2016 New features include the addition of Siri, Optimized Storage, and updates to Photos, Messages, and iTunes [222] [223]\n\n\nmacOS 10.13 High Sierra\nmacOS 10.13 High Sierra was released to the public on September 25, 2017 [224] Like OS X El Capitan and OS X Mountain Lion, High Sierra is a refinement-based update having very few new features visible to the user, including updates to Safari, Photos, and Mail, among other changes [225]\n\n\nmacOS 10.14 Mojave\nmacOS 10.14 Mojave was released on September 24, 2018 [53] The update introduced a system-wide dark mode and several new apps lifted from iOS, such as Apple News It was the first version to require a GPU that supports Metal Mojave also changed the system software update mechanism from the App Store (where it had been since OS X Mountain Lion) to a new panel in System Preferences App updates remain in the App Store.\n\n\nmacOS 10.15 Catalina\nmacOS 10.15 Catalina was released on October 7, 2019 [227] Updates included enhanced voice control, and bundled apps for music, video, and podcasts that together replace the functions of iTunes, and the ability to use an iPad as an external monitor Catalina officially dropped support for 32-bit applications [228]\n\n\nmacOS 11 Big Sur\nmacOS Big Sur was announced during the WWDC keynote speech on June 22, 2020, [229] and it was made available to the general public on November 12, 2020 This is the first time the major version number of the operating system has been incremented since the Mac OS X Public Beta in 2000 It brings Arm support, [230] new icons, and aesthetic user interface changes to the system [231]\n\n\nmacOS 12 Monterey\nmacOS Monterey was announced during the WWDC keynote speech on June 7, 2021, and released on October 25, 2021, introducing Universal Control (which allows input devices to be used with multiple devices simultaneously), Focus modes (which allows selectively limiting notifications and alerts depending on user-defined user/work modes), Shortcuts (a task automation framework previously only available on iOS and iPadOS expected to replace Automator), a redesigned Safari Web browser, and updates and improvements to FaceTime [232]\n\n\nmacOS 13 Ventura\nmacOS Ventura was announced during the WWDC keynote speech on June 6, 2022 [233] and released on October 24, 2022 [234] It came with the redesigned System Preferences (named System Settings) to a more iOS-like design, and the new Freeform, Weather and Clock apps that run natively on Mac Users can use an iPhone as a webcam for video conferencing with Continuity Camera Siri's appearance was changed to look more like the versions on iOS 14 and iPadOS 14 Mail introduced schedule send and undo send for emails, and Message also got the ability to undo send and edit messages Stage Manager was introduced as a new way to organize all open windows in a desktop Maps gained the feature for multiple-stop routes, Metal 3 was added with support for spatial and temporal image upscaling, Lockdown mode was added to reduce the risk of a cyberattack, and the ability to play ambient background sounds was added as an accessibility feature in System Settings.\n\n\nmacOS 14 Sonoma\nmacOS Sonoma was announced during the WWDC keynote speech on June 5, 2023, and released on September 26, 2023 [235] macOS Sonoma revamped widgets—they can now be placed anywhere on the desktop Game mode optimizes game performance by prioritizing gaming tasks and allocating more GPU and CPU capacity to the game, and by doing so is able to provide smoother frame rates for gameplay The Spotlight Search bar and all app icons were made even more rounded, smoother animations were implemented for notifications and the lock screen, and new slow-motion screensavers of different locations worldwide were added When logged in, they gradually slow down and become the desktop wallpaper.\n\n\nmacOS 15 Sequoia\nmacOS Sequoia was announced during the WWDC keynote speech on June 10, 2024 It adds support for Apple Intelligence features (for example a redesigned Siri, writing tools, Image Playground, Genmoji, and system-wide integration with GPT-4o), as well as adding iPhone Mirroring, a new dedicated Passwords app for faster autofilling and more organised passwords, and window tiling - a similar feature to Microsoft Windows' Aero Snap window snapping feature [236]\n\n\nSecurity\nApple publishes Apple Platform Security documents to lay out the security protections built into macOS and Mac hardware [237]\n\n\nMalware and spyware\nIn its earlier years, Mac OS X enjoyed a near-absence of the types of malware and spyware that have affected Microsoft Windows users [247] [248] [249] macOS has a smaller usage share compared to Windows [250] Worms, as well as potential vulnerabilities, were noted in 2006, which led some industry analysts and anti-virus companies to issue warnings that Apple's Mac OS X is not immune to malware [251] Increasing market share coincided with additional reports of a variety of attacks [252] In early 2011, Mac OS X experienced a large increase in malware attacks, [253] and malware such as Mac Defender, MacProtector, and MacGuard was seen as an increasing problem for Mac users At first, the malware installer required the user to enter the administrative password, but later versions installed without user input [254] Initially, Apple support staff were instructed not to assist in the removal of the malware or admit the existence of the malware issue, but as the malware spread, a support document was issued Apple announced an OS X update to fix the problem An estimated 100,000 users were affected [255] [256] Apple releases security updates for macOS regularly, [257] as well as signature files containing malware signatures for Xprotect, an anti-malware feature part of File Quarantine present since Mac OS X Snow Leopard [258]\n\n\nReception\nAs of January 2023 [update], macOS is the second-most widely used general-purpose desktop operating system used on the World Wide Web following Microsoft Windows, with a 15.33% usage share according to statistics compiled by StatCounter GlobalStats [259]\n\n\nUsage share\nAs of January 2023 [update], macOS is the second-most widely used general-purpose desktop operating system used on the World Wide Web following Microsoft Windows, with a 15.33% usage share according to statistics compiled by StatCounter GlobalStats [259]\n\n\nPromotion\nAs a device company, Apple has mostly promoted macOS to sell Macs, with promotion of macOS updates focused on existing users, promotion at Apple Store and other retail partners, or through events for developers In larger scale advertising campaigns, Apple specifically promoted macOS as better for handling media and other home-user applications, and comparing Mac OS X (especially versions Tiger and Leopard) with the heavy criticism Microsoft received for the long-awaited Windows Vista operating system [260] [261]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**MacOS**\n\nMacOS is a series of operating systems developed by Apple Inc. for its Macintosh computers. The operating system is known for its user-friendly interface, stability, and security features. MacOS has undergone significant changes and improvements since its first release in 2001, with several major updates and refinements over the years.\n\n**History**\n\nThe heritage of what would become MacOS had originated at NeXT, a company founded by Steve Jobs following his departure from Apple in 1985. At NeXT, the Unix-like NeXTSTEP operating system was developed, before being launched in 1989. The kernel of NeXTSTEP is based upon the Mach kernel, which was originally developed at Carnegie Mellon University, with additional kernel layers and low-level user space code derived from parts of FreeBSD and other BSD operating systems. Its graphical user interface was built on top of an object-oriented GUI toolkit using the Objective-C programming language.\n\n**Development**\n\nThe development of MacOS began at NeXT, where the Unix-like NeXTSTEP operating system was developed. The kernel of NeXTSTEP is based upon the Mach kernel, which was originally developed at Carnegie Mellon University, with additional kernel layers and low-level user space code derived from parts of FreeBSD and other BSD operating systems. Its graphical user interface was built on top of an object-oriented GUI toolkit using the Objective-C programming language.\n\n**Mac OS X**\n\nThe letter \"X\" in Mac OS X's name refers to the number 10, a Roman numeral, and Apple has stated that it should be pronounced \"ten\" in this context. However, it is also commonly pronounced like the letter \"X\". The iPhone X, iPhone XR, and iPhone XS all later followed this convention.\n\n**OS X**\n\nIn 2012, with the release of OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion, the name of the system was officially shortened from Mac OS X to OS X, after the previous version shortened the system name in a similar fashion a year prior. Apple removed the head of OS X development, Scott Forstall, and design was changed towards a more minimal direction. Apple's new user interface design, using deep color saturation, text-only buttons, and a minimal, 'flat' interface, was debuted with iOS 7 in 2013.\n\n**macOS**\n\nIn 2016, with the release of macOS 10.12 Sierra, the name was changed from OS X to macOS with the purpose of aligning it with the branding of Apple's other primary operating systems: iOS, watchOS, and tvOS. macOS Sierra added Siri, iCloud Drive, picture-in-picture support, a Night Shift mode that switches the display to warmer colors at night, and two Continuity features: Universal Clipboard, which syncs a user's clipboard across their Apple devices, and Auto Unlock, which can unlock a user's Mac with their Apple Watch.\n\n**Architecture**\n\nAt macOS's core is a POSIX-compliant operating system built on top of the XNU kernel, which incorporated large parts of the FreeBSD kernel and userland for the standard Unix facilities available from the command-line interface. Apple has released this family of software as a free and open-source operating system named Darwin. On top of Darwin, Apple layered a number of components, including the Aqua interface and the Finder, to complete the GUI-based operating system which is macOS.\n\n**Software Compatibility**\n\nApple offered two main APIs to develop software natively for macOS: Cocoa and Carbon. Cocoa was a descendant of APIs inherited from OPENSTEP with no ancestry from the classic Mac OS, while Carbon was an adaptation of classic Mac OS APIs, allowing Mac software to be minimally rewritten to run natively on Mac OS X.\n\n**Hardware Compatibility**\n\nMacOS is compatible with a wide range of hardware devices, including Apple's own Macintosh computers, as well as other devices from various manufacturers.\n\n**PowerPC–Intel Transition**\n\nIn April 2002, eWeek announced a rumor that Apple had a version of Mac OS X code-named Marklar, which ran on Intel x86 processors. The idea behind Marklar was to keep Mac OS X running on an alternative platform should Apple become dissatisfied with the progress of the PowerPC platform. These rumors subsided until late in May 2005, when various media outlets, such as The Wall Street Journal and CNET, announced that Apple would unveil Marklar in the coming months.\n\n**Intel–Apple Silicon Transition**\n\nRumors of Apple shifting Macs from Intel to in-house ARM processors used by iOS devices began circulating as early as 2011, and ebbed and flowed throughout the 2010s. Rumors intensified in 2020, when numerous reports announced that the company would announce its shift to its custom processors at WWDC.\n\n**Features**\n\nOne of the major differences between the classic Mac OS and the current macOS was the addition of Aqua, a graphical user interface with water-like elements, in the first major release of Mac OS X. Every window element, text, graphic, or widget is drawn on-screen using spatial anti-aliasing technology. ColorSync, a technology introduced many years before, was improved and built into the core drawing engine, to provide color matching for printing and multimedia professionals. Also, drop shadows were added around windows and isolated text elements to provide a sense of depth. New interface elements were integrated, including sheets (dialog boxes attached to specific windows) and drawers, which would slide out and provide options.\n\n**Built-in Components**\n\nThe Finder is a file browser allowing quick access to all areas of the computer, which has been modified throughout subsequent releases of macOS. Quick Look has been part of the Finder since version 10.5, allowing for dynamic previews of files, including videos and multi-page documents without opening any other applications. Spotlight, a file searching technology, has been integrated into the Finder since version 10.4, allowing rapid real-time searches of data files; mail messages; photos; and other information based on item properties (metadata) or content. macOS makes use of a Dock, which holds file and folder shortcuts as well as minimized windows.\n\n**Multilingual Support**\n\nThere are 47 system languages available in macOS for the user at the moment of installation, and the system language is used throughout the entire operating system environment. Input methods for typing in dozens of scripts can be chosen independently of the system language. Recent updates have added increased support for Chinese characters and interconnections with popular social networks in China.\n\n**Updating Methods**\n\nMacOS updates can be installed through the App Store, which was introduced with OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard. The App Store allows users to download and install updates, as well as purchase and download new apps.\n\n**Release History**\n\nMacOS has undergone significant changes and improvements since its first release in 2001, with several major updates and refinements over the years. Here is a list of the major releases of MacOS:\n\n* MacOS X 10.0 Cheetah (2001)\n* MacOS X 10.1 Puma (2001)\n* MacOS X 10.2 Jaguar (2002)\n* MacOS X 10.3 Panther (2003)\n* MacOS X 10.4 Tiger (2005)\n* MacOS X 10.5 Leopard (2007)\n* MacOS X 10.6 Snow Leopard (2009)\n* OS X 10.7 Lion (2011)\n* OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion (2012)\n* OS X 10.9 Mavericks (2013)\n* OS X 10.10 Yosemite (2014)\n* OS X 10.11 El Capitan (2015)\n* macOS 10.12 Sierra (2016)\n* macOS 10.13 High Sierra (2017)\n* macOS 10.14 Mojave (2018)\n* macOS 10.15 Catalina (2019)\n* macOS 11 Big Sur (2020)\n* macOS 12 Monterey (2021)\n* macOS 13 Ventura (2022)\n* macOS 14 Sonoma (2023)\n\n**Security**\n\nApple publishes Apple Platform Security documents to lay out the security protections built into macOS and Mac hardware. MacOS has a strong focus on security, with features such as Gatekeeper, which controls which apps can be installed on a Mac, and XProtect, which scans apps for malware.\n\n**Malware and Spyware**\n\nIn its earlier years, Mac OS X enjoyed a near-absence of the types of malware and spyware that have affected Microsoft Windows users. However, in recent years, the number of malware and spyware attacks has increased, and MacOS has become a target for attackers.\n\n**Reception**\n\nAs of January 2023, MacOS is the second-most widely used general-purpose desktop operating system used on the World Wide Web, with a 15.33% usage share according to statistics compiled by StatCounter GlobalStats.", "prompt": "Write a complete

on iOS 7, the version released in 2013, OS X 10.9 Mavericks, was something of a transitional release, with some of the skeuomorphic design removed, while most of the general interface of Mavericks remained unchanged [42] The next version, OS X 10.10 Yosemite, adopted a design similar to iOS 7 but with greater complexity suitable for an interface controlled with a mouse [43]\n\n\nmacOS\nIn 2016,

support for Chinese characters and interconnections with popular social networks in China [172] [173] [174] [175]\n\n\nUpdating methods\n\n\n\nRelease history\nMac OS X versions were named after big cats, with the exception of Mac OS X Server 1.0 and the original public beta, from Mac OS X 10.0 until OS X 10.9 Mavericks, when Apple switched to using California locations Prior to its release, version 10.0 was code named internally at Apple as \"Cheetah\", and Mac OS X 10.1 was code named internally as \"Puma\" After the immense buzz surrounding Mac OS X 10.2, codenamed \"Jaguar\", Apple's product marketing began openly using the code names to promote the operating system Mac OS X 10.3 was marketed as \"Panther\", Mac OS X 10.4 as \"Tiger\", Mac OS X 10.5 as \"Leopard\", Mac OS X 10.6 as \"Snow Leopard\", Mac OS X 10.7 as \"Lion\", OS X 10.8 as \"Mountain Lion\", and OS X 10.9 as \"Mavericks\".\n\n\nMac OS X Public Beta\nOn September 13, 2000, Apple released a US$29.95 [183] \"preview\" version of Mac OS X, internally codenamed Kodiak, to gain feedback from users.\n\n\nMac OS X 10.0\nOn March 24, 2001, Apple released Mac OS X 10.0 (internally codenamed Cheetah) [185]\nThe initial version was slow, [186] incomplete, [187] and had very few applications available at launch, mostly from independent developers [188] While many critics suggested that the operating system was not ready for mainstream adoption, they recognized the importance of its initial launch as a base on which to improve [187] Simply releasing Mac OS X was received by the Macintosh community as a great accomplishment, [187] for attempts to overhaul the Mac OS had been underway since 1996, and delayed by countless setbacks.\n\n\nMac OS X 10.1\nLater that year, on September 25, 2001, Mac OS X 10.1 (internally codenamed Puma) was released It featured increased performance and provided missing features, such as DVD playback Apple released 10.1 as a free upgrade CD for 10.0 users, in addition to the $129 boxed version for people running Mac OS 9 It was discovered that the upgrade CDs were full install CDs that could be used with Mac OS 9 systems by removing a specific file; Apple later re-released the CDs in an actual stripped-down format that did not facilitate installation on such systems [189] On January 7, 2002, Apple announced that Mac OS X was to be the default operating system for all Macintosh products by the end of that month [190]\n\n\nMac OS X 10.2 Jaguar\nOn August 23, 2002, [191] Apple followed up with Mac OS X 10.2 Jaguar, the first release to use its code name as part of the branding [192]\nIt brought significant performance improvements, and an updated version of Aqua's visual design Jaguar also included over 150 [193] new user-facing features, including Quartz Extreme for compositing graphics directly on an ATI Radeon or Nvidia GeForce2 MX AGP-based video card with at least 16 MB of VRAM, a system-wide repository for contact information in the new Address Book, and the iChat instant messaging client [194] The Happy Mac icon — which had appeared during the Mac OS startup sequence since the original Macintosh — was replaced with a grey Apple logo [195]\n\n\nMac OS X 10.3 Panther\nMac OS X v10.3 Panther was released on October 24, 2003 It significantly improved performance and incorporated the most extensive update yet to the user interface Panther included as many or more new features as Jaguar had the year before, including an updated Finder, incorporating a brushed-metal interface, Fast user switching, Exposé (Window manager), FileVault, Safari, iChat AV (which added video conferencing features to iChat), improved Portable Document Format (PDF) rendering and much greater Microsoft Windows interoperability [196] Support for some early G3 computers such as \"beige\" Power Macs and \"WallStreet\" PowerBooks was discontinued [197]\n\n\nMac OS X 10.4 Tiger\nMac OS X 10.4 Tiger was released on April 29, 2005 Apple stated that Tiger contained more than 200 new features [198] As with Panther, certain older machines were no longer supported; Tiger requires a Mac with 256 MB and a built-in FireWire port [113] Among the new features, Tiger introduced Spotlight, Dashboard, Smart Folders, updated Mail program with Smart Mailboxes, QuickTime 7, Safari 2, Automator, VoiceOver, Core Image and Core Video The initial release of the Apple TV used a modified version of Tiger with a different graphical interface and fewer applications and services [199] On January 10, 2006, Apple released the first Intel-based Macs along with the 10.4.4 update to Tiger This operating system functioned identically on the PowerPC-based Macs and the new Intel-based machines, with the exception of the Intel release lacking support for the Classic environment [200]\n\n\nMac OS X 10.5 Leopard\nMac OS X 10.5 Leopard was released on October 26, 2007 It was called by Apple \"the largest update of Mac OS X\" It brought more than 300 new features [201] Leopard supports both PowerPC- and Intel x86-based Macintosh computers; support for the G3 processor was dropped and the G4 processor required a minimum clock rate of 867 MHz, and at least 512 MB of RAM to be installed The single DVD works for all supported Macs (including 64-bit machines) New features include a new look, an updated Finder, Time Machine, Spaces, Boot Camp pre-installed, [202] full support for 64-bit applications (including graphical applications), new features in Mail and iChat, and a number of new security features Leopard is an Open Brand UNIX 03 registered product on the Intel platform It was also the first BSD-based OS to receive UNIX 03 certification [203] [204] Leopard dropped support for the Classic Environment and all Classic applications [205] It was the final version of Mac OS X to support the PowerPC architecture [206]\n\n\nMac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard\nMac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard was released on August 28, 2009 Rather than delivering big changes to the appearance and end user functionality like the previous releases of Mac OS X, Snow Leopard focused on \"under the hood\" changes, increasing the performance, efficiency, and stability of the operating system For most users, the most noticeable changes were: the disk space that the operating system frees up after a clean install compared to Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard, a more responsive Finder rewritten in Cocoa, faster Time Machine backups, more reliable and user-friendly disk ejects, a more powerful version of the Preview application, as well as a faster Safari web browser Snow Leopard only supported machines with Intel CPUs, required at least 1 GB of RAM, and dropped default support for applications built for the PowerPC architecture (Rosetta could be installed as an additional component to retain support for PowerPC-only applications) [207]\n\n\nOS X 10.7 Lion\nOS X 10.7 Lion was released on July 20, 2011 It brought developments made in Apple's iOS, such as an easily navigable display of installed applications called Launchpad and a greater use of multi-touch gestures, to the Mac This release removed Rosetta, making it incompatible with PowerPC applications [134]\n\n\nOS X 10.8 Mountain Lion\nOS X 10.8 Mountain Lion was released on July 25, 2012 [72] Following the release of Lion the previous year, it was the first of the annual rather than two-yearly updates to OS X (and later macOS), which also closely aligned with the annual iOS operating system updates It incorporates some features seen in iOS 5, which include Game Center, support for iMessage in the new Messages messaging application, and Reminders as a to-do list app separate from iCal (which is renamed as Calendar, like the iOS app) It also includes support for storing iWork documents in iCloud [212] Notification Center, which makes its debut in Mountain Lion, is a desktop version similar to the one in iOS 5.0 and higher Application pop-ups are now concentrated on the corner of the screen, and the Center itself is pulled from the right side of the screen Mountain Lion also includes more Chinese features including support for Baidu as an option for Safari search engine, QQ, 163.com and 126.com services for Mail, Contacts and Calendar, Youku, Tudou and Sina Weibo are integrated into share sheets [175]\n\n\nOS X 10.9 Mavericks\nOS X 10.9 Mavericks was released on October 22, 2013 It was a free upgrade to all users running Snow Leopard or later with a 64-bit Intel processor [215] Its changes include the addition of the previously iOS-only Maps and iBooks applications, improvements to the Notification Center, enhancements to several applications, and many under-the-hood improvements [216]\n\n\nOS X 10.10 Yosemite\nOS X 10.10 Yosemite was released on October 16, 2014 It features a redesigned user interface similar to that of iOS 7, intended to feature a more minimal, text-based 'flat' design, with use of translucency effects and intensely saturated colors [217] Apple's showcase new feature in Yosemite is Handoff, which enables users with iPhones running iOS 8.1 or later to answer phone calls, receive and send SMS messages, and complete unfinished iPhone emails on their Mac As of OS X 10.10.3, Photos replaced iPhoto and Aperture [218]\n\n\nOS X 10.11 El Capitan\nOS X 10.11 El Capitan was released on September 30, 2015 Similar to Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard, Apple described this release as emphasizing \"refinements to the Mac experience\" and \"improvements to system performance\" [219] Refinements include public transport built into the Maps application, GUI improvements to the Notes application, adopting San Francisco as the system font for clearer legibility, and the introduction of System Integrity Protection.\n\n\nmacOS 10.12 Sierra\nmacOS 10.12 Sierra was released to the public on September 20, 2016 New features include the addition of Siri, Optimized Storage, and updates to Photos, Messages, and iTunes [222] [223]\n\n\nmacOS 10.13 High Sierra\nmacOS 10.13 High Sierra was released to the public on September 25, 2017 [224] Like OS X El Capitan and OS X Mountain Lion, High Sierra is a refinement-based update having very few new features visible to the user, including updates to Safari, Photos, and Mail, among other changes [225]\n\n\nmacOS 10.14 Mojave\nmacOS 10.14 Mojave was released on September 24, 2018 [53] The update introduced a system-wide dark mode and several new apps lifted from iOS, such as Apple News It was the first version to require a GPU that supports Metal Mojave also changed the system software update mechanism from the App Store (where it had been since OS X Mountain Lion) to a new panel in System Preferences App updates remain in the App Store.\n\n\nmacOS 10.15 Catalina\nmacOS 10.15 Catalina was released on October 7, 2019 [227] Updates included enhanced voice control, and bundled apps for music, video, and podcasts that together replace the functions of iTunes, and the ability to use an iPad as an external monitor Catalina officially dropped support for 32-bit applications [228]\n\n\nmacOS 11 Big Sur\nmacOS Big Sur was announced during the WWDC keynote speech on June 22, 2020, [229] and it was made available to the general public on November 12, 2020 This is the first time the major version number of the operating system has been incremented since the Mac OS X Public Beta in 2000 It brings Arm support, [230] new icons, and aesthetic user interface changes to the system [231]\n\n\nmacOS 12 Monterey\nmacOS Monterey was announced during the WWDC keynote speech on June 7, 2021, and released on October 25, 2021, introducing Universal Control (which allows input devices to be used with multiple devices simultaneously), Focus modes (which allows selectively limiting notifications and alerts depending on user-defined user/work modes), Shortcuts (a task automation framework previously only available on iOS and iPadOS expected to replace Automator), a redesigned Safari Web browser, and updates and improvements to FaceTime [232]\n\n\nmacOS 13 Ventura\nmacOS Ventura was announced during the WWDC keynote speech on June 6, 2022 [233] and released on October 24, 2022 [234] It came with the redesigned System Preferences (named System Settings) to a more iOS-like design, and the new Freeform, Weather and Clock apps that run natively on Mac Users can use an iPhone as a webcam for video conferencing with Continuity Camera Siri's appearance was changed to look more like the versions on iOS 14

security protections built into macOS and Mac hardware [237]\n\n\nMalware and spyware\nIn its earlier years, Mac OS X enjoyed a near-absence of the types of malware and spyware that have affected Microsoft Windows users [247] [248] [249] macOS has a smaller usage share compared to Windows [250] Worms, as well as potential vulnerabilities, were noted in 2006, which led some industry analysts and anti-virus companies to issue warnings that Apple's Mac OS X is not immune to malware [251] Increasing market share coincided with additional reports of a variety of attacks [252] In early 2011, Mac OS X experienced a large increase in malware attacks, [253] and malware such as Mac Defender, MacProtector, and MacGuard was seen as an increasing problem for Mac users At first, the malware installer required the user to enter the administrative password, but later versions installed without user input [254] Initially, Apple support staff were instructed not to assist in the removal of the malware or admit the existence of the malware issue, but as the malware spread, a support document was issued Apple announced an OS X update to fix the problem An estimated 100,000 users were affected [255] [256] Apple releases security updates for macOS regularly, [257] as well as signature files containing malware signatures for Xprotect, an anti-malware feature part of File Quarantine present since Mac OS X Snow Leopard [258]\n\n\nReception\nAs of January 2023 [update], macOS is the second-most widely used general-purpose desktop operating system used on the World Wide Web following Microsoft Windows, with a 15.33% usage share according to statistics compiled by StatCounter GlobalStats [259]\n\n\nUsage share\nAs of January 2023 [update], macOS is the second-most widely used general-purpose desktop operating system used on the World Wide Web following Microsoft Windows, with a 15.33% usage share according to statistics compiled by StatCounter GlobalStats [259]\n\n\nPromotion\nAs a device company, Apple has mostly promoted macOS to sell Macs, with promotion of macOS updates focused on existing users, promotion at Apple Store and other retail partners, or through events for developers In larger scale advertising campaigns, Apple specifically promoted macOS as better for handling media and other home-user applications, and comparing Mac OS X (especially versions Tiger and Leopard) with the heavy criticism Microsoft received for the long-awaited Windows Vista operating system [260] [261]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal

{"title": "Doha", "content": "\nEtymology\nAccording to the Ministry of Municipality and Environment of Qatar, the name \"Doha\" originated from the Arabic term dohat, meaning \"roundness\"—a reference to the rounded bays surrounding the area's coastline [8]\n\n\nHistory\nThe city of Doha was formed seceding from another local settlement known as Al Bidda The earliest documented mention of Al Bidda was made in 1681 by the Carmelite Convent, in an account that chronicles several settlements in Qatar In the record, the ruler and a fort in the confines of Al Bidda are alluded to [9] [10] Carsten Niebuhr, a German explorer who visited the Arabian Peninsula, created one of the first maps to depict the settlement in 1765, in which he labelled it as 'Guttur' [9] [11]\n\n\nEstablishment of Al Bidda\nThe city of Doha was formed seceding from another local settlement known as Al Bidda The earliest documented mention of Al Bidda was made in 1681 by the Carmelite Convent, in an account that

created one of the first maps to depict the settlement in 1765, in which he labelled it as 'Guttur' [9] [11]\n\n\nFormation of Doha\nDoha was founded in the vicinity of Al Bidda sometime during the 1820s [19] In January 1823, political [clarification needed] resident John MacLeod visited Al Bidda to meet with the ruler and initial founder of Doha, Buhur bin Jubrun, who was also the chief of the Al-Buainain tribe [19] [20] MacLeod noted that Al Bidda was the only substantial trading port in the peninsula during this time Following the founding of Doha, written records often conflated Al Bidda and Doha due to the extremely close proximity of the two settlements [19] Later that year, Lt Guy and Lt Brucks mapped and wrote a description of the two settlements Despite being mapped as two separate entities, they were referred to under the collective name of Al Bidda in the written description [21] [22]\n\n\nArrival of the House of Al Thani\nThe Al Thani family migrated to Doha from Fuwayrit shortly after Bin Tarif's death in 1847 under the leadership of Mohammed bin Thani [28] [29] In the proceeding years, the Al Thani family assumed control of the town At various times, they swapped allegiances between the two prevailing powers in the area: the Al Khalifa of Bahrain and the Bin Saudis [28]\n\n\n20th century\nPearling had come to play a pivotal commercial role in Doha by the 20th century The population increased to around 12,000 inhabitants in the first half of the 20th century due to the flourishing pearl trade [39] A British political resident noted that should the supply of pearls drop, Qatar would 'practically cease to exist' [40] In 1907, the city accommodated 350 pearling boats with a combined crew size of 6,300 men By this time, the average prices of pearls had more than doubled since 1877 [41] The pearl market collapsed that year, forcing Jassim Al Thani to sell the country's pearl harvest at half its value The aftermath of the collapse resulted in the establishment of the country's first custom house in Doha [40]\n\n\nLorimer report (1908)\nBritish administrator and historian J G Lorimer authored an extensive handbook for British agents in the Persian Gulf entitled Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf in 1908 In it, he gives a comprehensive account of Doha at the time:\n\n\nBritish protectorate (1916–1971)\nIn April 1913, the Ottomans agreed to a British request that they withdraw all their troops from Qatar Ottoman presence in the peninsula ceased, when in August 1915, the Ottoman fort in Al Bidda was evacuated shortly after the start of World War I [45] One year later, Qatar agreed to be a British protectorate with Doha as its official capital [46] [47]\n\n\nPost-independence\nQatar officially declared its independence in 1971, with Doha as its capital city [3] In 1973, the University of Qatar was opened by emiri decree, [53] and in 1975, the Qatar National Museum opened in what was originally the ruler's palace [54] During the 1970s, all old neighborhoods in Doha were razed and the inhabitants moved to new suburban developments, such as Al Rayyan, Madinat Khalifa and Al Gharafa The Doha Metropolitan Area's population grew from 89,000 in the 1970s to over 434,000 in 1997 Additionally, land policies resulted in the total land area increasing to over 7,100 hectares (about 17,000 acres) by 1995, an increase from 130 hectares in the middle of the 20th century [55]\n\n\nGeography\nDoha is located on the central-east portion of Qatar, bordered by the Persian Gulf on its coast Its elevation is 10 m (33 ft) [65] Doha is highly urbanized Land reclamation off the coast has added 400 hectares of land and 30 km of coastline [66] Half of the 22 km2 of surface area which Hamad International Airport was constructed on was reclaimed land [67] The geology of Doha is primarily composed of weathered unconformity on the top of the Eocene period Dammam Formation, forming dolomitic limestone [68]\n\n\nTopography and

the country's rodent infestations, are now widespread in Doha, with government estimates putting the total population at between 2 million and 3 million [69] The Gulf sand gecko, having been first observed in Qatar on Doha's islands in 2013, is now also found on the promontory in coastal and saline places [70]\n\n\nIslands and coast\nThe Pearl is an artificial island in Doha with a surface area of nearly 400 ha (1,000 acres) [86] The total project has been estimated to cost $15 billion upon completion [87] Other islands off Doha's coast include Palm Tree Island, Shrao's Island, Al Safliya Island, and Al Aaliya Island [88]\n\n\nClimate\nDoha has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification BWh) with long, extremely hot summers and short, mild to warm winters The average high temperatures between May and September surpass 38 °C (100 °F) and often approach 45 °C (113 °F) Humidity is usually the lowest in May and June Dewpoints can surpass 30 °C (86 °F) in the summer

Doha and its metropolitan area [105] The district with the highest population density is the central area of Al Najada, which also accommodates the highest total population in the country The population density across the greater Doha region ranges from 20,000 people per km2 to 25-50 people per km2 [106] Doha witnessed explosive growth rates in population in the first decade of the 21st century, absorbing the majority of the thousands of people then immigrating to Qatar every month [107]: 6  Doha's population is around one million, with the population of the city more than doubling from 2000 to 2010 [2]\n\n\nEthnicity and languages\nThe population of Doha is overwhelmingly composed of expatriates, with Qatari nationals forming a minority The largest portion of expatriates in

generate significant revenue for the country and boost its tourism sector High and rising incomes in Qatar offer significant opportunities in culinary establishments and retail sectors Premium and healthy brands are especially well received Convenience food is also an increasingly important sector for younger Qataris and visitors [135] In recent years, Qatar has been taking steps to diversify its economy and reduce its reliance on oil and gas revenues The country has launched several initiatives aimed at promoting non-oil sectors such as tourism, finance, and technology For example, Qatar has invested heavily in building world-class infrastructure, including the Hamad International Airport and the Qatar Free Zones Authority, to attract foreign investors and businesses to set up shop in

traditional architecture, the primary building material was locally quarried limestone, with walls typically measuring 0.4 metres (1 ft 4 in) to 0.6 metres (2 ft 0 in) thick, constructed using two rows of large facing stones with a core of mud, gravel, and smaller stones These walls were then covered with clay-rich mud or gypsum-based render Plaster, known as juss, was made from crushed beachrock, shell, baked lime, or gypsum, and applied in three layers for both functional and decorative purposes Roofing was characteristically flat, utilizing mangrove beams (danshal) imported from East Africa, overlaid with split bamboo, woven reed, and palm mats, then sealed with tamped earth [144] Distinctive architectural elements included colonnaded verandas (liwan) with lintels made of mangrove poles bound with jute rope, and wooden waterspouts for drainage Valuable materials such as wooden beams, windows, and doors were often recycled from older structures [145]\n\n\nTraditional

country located in the Middle East. The city is situated on the central-east portion of Qatar, bordered by the Persian Gulf on its coast. Doha is a significant cultural and economic hub in the region, known for its rich history, stunning architecture, and vibrant cultural scene.\n\n**History**\n\nThe city of Doha was formed seceding from another local settlement known as Al Bidda. The earliest documented mention of Al Bidda was made in 1681 by the Carmelite Convent, in an account that chronicles several settlements in Qatar. In the record, the ruler and a fort in the confines of Al Bidda are alluded to. Carsten Niebuhr, a German explorer who visited the Arabian Peninsula, created one of the first maps to depict the settlement in 1765, in which he labelled it as 'Guttur'.\n\n**Formation of Doha**\n\nDoha was founded in the vicinity of Al Bidda sometime during the 1820s. In January 1823, political resident John MacLeod visited Al Bidda to meet with the ruler and initial founder of Doha, Buhur bin Jubrun, who was also the chief of the Al-Buainain tribe. MacLeod noted that Al Bidda was the only substantial trading port in the peninsula during this time. Following the founding of Doha, written records often conflated Al Bidda and Doha due to the extremely close proximity of the two settlements.\n\n**Arrival of the House of Al Thani**\n\nThe Al Thani family migrated to Doha from Fuwayrit shortly after Bin Tarif's death in 1847 under the leadership of Mohammed bin Thani. In the proceeding years, the Al Thani family assumed control of the town. At various times, they swapped allegiances between the two prevailing powers in the area: the Al Khalifa of Bahrain and the Bin Saudis.\n\n**20th century**\n\nPearling had come to play a pivotal commercial role in Doha by the 20th century. The population increased to around 12,000 inhabitants in the first half of the 20th century due to the flourishing pearl trade. A British political resident noted that should the supply of pearls drop, Qatar would 'practically cease to exist'. In 1907, the city accommodated 350 pearling boats with a combined crew size of 6,300 men. By this time, the average prices of pearls had more than doubled since 1877. The pearl market collapsed that year, forcing Jassim Al Thani to sell the country's pearl harvest at half its value.\n\n**Lorimer report (1908)**\n\nBritish administrator and historian J G Lorimer authored an extensive handbook for British agents in the Persian Gulf entitled Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf in 1908. In it, he gives a comprehensive account of Doha at the time.\n\n**British protectorate (1916–1971)**\n\nIn April 1913, the Ottomans agreed to a British request that they withdraw all their troops from Qatar. Ottoman presence in the peninsula ceased, when in August 1915, the Ottoman fort in Al Bidda was evacuated shortly after the start of World War I. One year later, Qatar agreed to be a British protectorate with Doha as its official capital.\n\n**Post-independence**\n\nQatar officially declared its independence in 1971, with Doha as its capital city. In 1973, the University of Qatar was opened by emiri decree, and in 1975, the Qatar National Museum opened in what was originally the ruler's palace. During the 1970s, all old neighborhoods in Doha were razed and the inhabitants moved to new suburban developments, such as Al Rayyan, Madinat Khalifa, and Al Gharafa.\n\n**Geography**\n\nDoha is located on the central-east portion of Qatar, bordered by the Persian Gulf on its coast. Its elevation is 10 metres (33 feet). Doha is highly urbanized. Land reclamation off the coast has added 400 hectares of land and 30 kilometres of coastline. Half of the 22 square kilometres of surface area which Hamad International Airport was constructed on was reclaimed land.\n\n**Wildlife**\n\nStreet cats, having first been introduced in the 1960s to deal with the country's rodent infestations, are now widespread in Doha, with government estimates putting the total population at between 2 million and 3 million. The Gulf sand gecko, having been first observed in Qatar on Doha's islands in 2013, is now also found on the promontory in coastal and saline places.\n\n**Islands and coast**\n\nThe Pearl is an artificial island in Doha with a surface area of nearly 400 hectares. Other islands off Doha's coast include Palm Tree Island, Shrao's Island, Al Safliya Island, and Al Aaliya Island.\n\n**Climate**\n\nDoha has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification BWh) with long, extremely hot summers and short, mild to warm winters. The average high temperatures between May and September surpass 38 degrees Celsius (100 degrees Fahrenheit) and often approach 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit). Humidity is usually the lowest in May and June. Dewpoints can surpass 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit) in the summer. Throughout the summer, the city averages almost no precipitation, and less than 20 millimetres (0.79 inches) during other months. Rainfall is scarce, at a total of 75 millimetres (2.95 inches) per year, falling on isolated days mostly between October and March.\n\n**Demographics**\n\nA significant portion of Qatar's population lives within Doha and its metropolitan area. The district with the highest population density is the central area of Al Najada, which also accommodates the highest total population in the country. Doha witnessed explosive growth rates in population in the first decade of the 21st century, absorbing the majority of the thousands of people then immigrating to Qatar every month.\n\n**Ethnicity and languages**\n\nThe population of Doha is overwhelmingly composed of expatriates, with Qatari nationals forming a minority. The largest portion of expatriates in Qatar are from South-East and South Asian countries, mainly India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Philippines, and Bangladesh, with large numbers of expatriates also coming from the Levant Arab countries, Djibouti, Somalia, North Africa, and East Asia.\n\n**Religion**\n\nThe majority of residents in Doha are Muslim. A majority of mosques are either Salafi or Sunni-oriented.\n\n**Administration**\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, Doha was divided into 9 main districts. In the 2010 census, there were more than 60 districts recorded in Doha Municipality. Some of the districts of Doha include Al Najada, Al Hilal, Al Jasra, Al Mussaid, and many others.\n\n**Economy**\n\nDoha is the economic center of Qatar. The city is the headquarters of numerous domestic and international organizations, including the country's largest oil and gas companies, QatarEnergy and QatarEnergy LNG. Doha's economy is built primarily on the revenue the country has made from its oil and natural gas industries. Doha was included in Fortune's 15 best new cities for business in 2011.\n\n**Tourism and retail**\n\nDoha is considered as the most important tourist city in Qatar. Qatar's tourism sector is also a key focus of its economic diversification strategy. The country is investing in the development of new tourism infrastructure, such as hotels and resorts, and promoting its cultural attractions, such as the Museum of Islamic Art and the Katara Cultural Village.\n\n**Architecture**\n\nIn Doha's traditional architecture, the primary building material was locally quarried limestone, with walls typically measuring 0.4 metres (1.3 feet) to 0.6 metres (2 feet) thick, constructed using two rows of large facing stones with a core of mud, gravel, and smaller stones. These walls were then covered with clay-rich mud or gypsum-based render. Plaster, known as juss, was made from crushed beachrock, shell, baked lime, or gypsum, and applied in three layers for both functional and decorative purposes.\n\n**Planned communities**\n\nOne of the largest projects underway in Qatar is Lusail City, a planned community north of Doha, which is estimated to be completed by 2020 at a cost of approximately $45 billion. It is designed to accommodate 450,000 people. Al Waab City, another planned community under development, is estimated to cost QR15 billion.\n\n**Transportation**\n\nTo support the expanding city and increasing numbers of residents and commuters, Qatar has heavily invested in upgrading the infrastructure of Doha and Qatar. Since 2004, Doha has been undergoing a huge expansion to its transportation network, including the addition of new highways, a new airport in 2014, a new seaport in 2016, and an 85-kilometre metro system which went operational in 2019.\n\n**Roads**\n\nThe main highways in Doha include Dukhan Highway, connecting to Dukhan; Al Shamal Road, connecting the Doha Metropolitan Area to the northern region of Al Shamal; Al Khor Coastal Road, connecting to Al Khor; Salwa Road, connecting to the Saudi Arabian border; Al Majd Road, the longest highway in Qatar; Lusail Expressway, connecting to Lusail; F-Ring Road, linking Rawdat Al Khail Street to Al Matar Street; G-Ring Road, connecting Hamad International Airport to the south of the Industrial Area; and Industrial Area Road, a 12.5-kilometre dual carriageway positioned south of the Doha Industrial Area.\n\n**Rail**\n\nThree of the Doha Metro's four lines are currently fully operational. The system consists of the Red Line, the Gold Line, the Green Line, and the incomplete Blue Line. The Blue Line is expected to be completed in the second phase in 2025. Msheireb Station is the transfer station for all of the metro lines.\n\n**Air**\n\nDoha is served by Hamad International Airport, which is Qatar's principal international gateway. The airport opened in 2014, replacing Doha International Airport. Hamad International Airport became the first Middle Eastern airport to be awarded the Skytrax's World Best Airport for 2021 in the 2021 World Airport Awards.\n\n**Taxi**\n\nThere are plenty of options for picking up a taxi in Doha, including hailing one off the street, visiting the nearest taxi stand, requesting hotel reception staff to book one, or downloading a taxi app. Most of the taxis in Doha are affiliated with the government-owned Mowasalat company since 2004.\n\n**Education**\n\nDoha is the educational center of the country and contains the highest preponderance of schools and colleges. In 1952, the first formal boys' school was opened in Doha. This was proceeded by the opening of the first formal girls' school three years later. The first university in the state, Qatar University, was opened in 1973.\n\n**Sports**\n\nFootball is the most popular sport in Doha. There are six Doha-based sports clubs with football teams competing in the Qatar Stars League, the country's top football league. They are Al Ahli, Al Arabi, Al Sadd, Al-Duhail, and Qatar SC. Al Sadd, Al Arabi, and Qatar SC are the three most successful teams in the league's history.\n\n**Culture**\n\nDoha was chosen as the Arab Capital of Culture in 2010. Cultural weeks organized by the Ministry of Culture, which featured both Arab and non-Arab cultures, were held in Doha from April to June to celebrate the city's selection.\n\n**Arts**\n\nThe Museum of Islamic Art or MIA in Doha, opened in 2008, is regarded as one of the best museums in the region. This, and several other Qatari museums located in the city, like the Arab Museum of Modern Art, falls under the Qatar Museums Authority (QMA) which is led by Sheikha Al-Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, the sister of the emir of Qatar.\n\n**Cinema**\n\nThe Doha Film Institute (DFI) is an organization established in 2010 to oversee film initiatives and create a sustainable film industry in Qatar. DFI was founded by H.E Sheikha Al Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani.\n\n**Media**\n\nQatar's first radio station, Mosque Radio, began broadcasting in the 1960s from Doha. The multinational media conglomerate Al Jazeera Media Network is based in Doha with its wide variety of channels, including Al Jazeera Arabic, Al Jazeera English, Al Jazeera Documentary Channel, Al Jazeera Mubasher, beIN Sports Arabia, and other operations, based in the TV Roundabout in the city. Al-Kass Sports Channel's headquarters is also located in Doha.\n\n**Theatre**\n\nThe first official theatre troupe in the country was created in 1972 as the \"Qatari Theatrical Troupe\".

{"title": "2011_Tōhoku_earthquake_and_tsunami", "content": "\nEarthquake\nThe magnitude 9.1 (Mw) undersea megathrust earthquake occurred on 11 March 2011 at 14:46 JST (05:46 UTC) in the north-western Pacific Ocean at a relatively shallow depth of 32 km (20 mi), [9] [56] with its epicenter approximately 72 km (45 mi) east of the Oshika Peninsula of Tōhoku, Japan, lasting approximately six minutes [9] [10] The earthquake was initially reported as 7.9 Mw by the USGS before it was quickly upgraded to 8.8 Mw, then to 8.9 Mw, [57] and then finally to 9.0 Mw [58] [59] On 11 July 2016, the USGS further upgraded the earthquake to 9.1 Sendai was the nearest major city to the earthquake, 130 km (81 mi) from the epicenter; the earthquake occurred 373 km (232 mi) northeast of Tokyo [9]\n\n\nGeology\nThis megathrust earthquake was a recurrence of the mechanism of the earlier 869 Sanriku earthquake, which has been estimated as having a magnitude of at least 8.4 Mw, which also created a large tsunami that inundated the Sendai plain [39] [74] [75] Three tsunami deposits have been identified within the Holocene sequence of the plain, all formed within the last 3,000 years, suggesting an 800 to 1,100 year recurrence interval for large tsunamigenic earthquakes In 2001 it was reckoned that there was a high likelihood of a large tsunami hitting the Sendai plain as more than 1,100 years had then elapsed [76] In 2007, the probability of an earthquake with a magnitude of Mw 8.1–8.3 was estimated as 99% within the following 30 years [77]\n\n\nEnergy\nThe surface energy of the seismic waves from the earthquake was calculated to be 1.9×1017 joules, [86] which is nearly double that of the 9.1 Mw 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami that killed 230,000 people If harnessed, the seismic energy from this earthquake would power a city the size of Los Angeles for an entire year [64] The seismic moment (M0), which represents a physical size for the event, was calculated by the USGS at 3.9×1022 joules, [87] slightly less than the 2004 Indian Ocean quake.\n\n\nIntensity\nThe strong ground motion registered at the maximum of 7 on the Japan Meteorological Agency seismic intensity scale in Kurihara, Miyagi Prefecture [92] Three other prefectures—Fukushima, Ibaraki and Tochigi—recorded a 6 upper on the JMA scale Seismic stations in Iwate, Gunma, Saitama and Chiba Prefecture measured a 6 lower, recording a 5 upper in Tokyo.\n\n\nGeophysical effects\nPortions of northeastern Japan shifted by as much as 2.4 meters (7 ft 10 in) closer to North America, [65] [66] making some sections of Japan's landmass wider than before [66] Those areas of Japan closest to the epicenter experienced the largest shifts [66] A 400-kilometer (250 mi) stretch of coastline dropped vertically by 0.6 meters (2 ft 0 in), allowing the tsunami to travel farther and faster onto land [66] One early estimate suggested that the Pacific plate may have moved westward by up to 20 meters (66 ft), [94] and another early estimate put the amount of slippage at as much as 40 m (130 ft) [95] On 6 April, the Japanese coast guard said that the quake shifted the seabed near the epicenter 24 meters (79 ft) and elevated the seabed off the coast of Miyagi Prefecture by 3 meters (9.8 ft) [96] A report by the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology, published in Science on 2 December 2011, concluded that the seabed in the area between the epicenter and the Japan Trench moved 50 meters (160 ft) east-southeast and rose about 7 meters (23 ft) as a result of the quake The report also stated that the quake had caused several major landslides on the seabed in the affected area [97]\n\n\nAftershocks\nJapan experienced over 1,000 aftershocks since the earthquake, with 80 registering over magnitude 6.0 Mw and several of which have been over magnitude 7.0 Mw.\n\n\nLand subsidence\nThe Geospatial Information Authority of Japan reported land subsidence based on the height of triangulation stations in the area measured by GPS as compared to their previous values from 14 April 2011 [123]\n\n\nEarthquake Warning System\nOne minute before the earthquake was felt in Tokyo, the Earthquake Early Warning system, which includes more than 1,000 seismometers in Japan, sent out warnings of impending strong shaking to millions It is believed that the early warning by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) saved many lives [126] [127] The warning for the general public was delivered about eight seconds after the first P-wave was detected, or about 31 seconds after the earthquake occurred However, the estimated intensities were smaller than the actual ones in some places, especially in Kanto, Koshinetsu, and Northern Tōhoku regions where the populace warning did not trigger According to the Japan Meteorological Agency, reasons for the underestimation include a saturated magnitude scale when using maximum amplitude as input, failure to fully take into account the area of the hypocenter, and the initial amplitude of the earthquake being less than that which would be predicted by an empirical relationship [128] [129] [130] [131]\n\n\nTsunami\nAn upthrust of 6 to 8 meters (20 to 26 ft) along a 180-kilometer (110 mi)-wide seabed at 60 kilometers (37 mi) offshore from the east coast of Tōhoku [134] resulted in a major tsunami that brought destruction along the Pacific coastline of Japan's northern islands Thousands of people died and entire towns were devastated The tsunami propagated throughout the Pacific Ocean region reaching the entire Pacific coast of North and South America from Alaska to Chile Warnings were issued and evacuations were carried out in many countries bordering the Pacific Although the tsunami affected many of these places, the heights of the waves were minor [135] [136] [137] Chile's Pacific coast, one of the farthest from Japan at about 17,000 kilometers (11,000 mi) away, was struck by waves 2 meters (6.6 ft) high, [138] [139] [140] compared with an estimated wave height of 38.9 meters (128 ft) at Omoe peninsula, Miyako city, Japan [38]\n\n\nJapan\nThe official figures released in 2021 reported 19,759 deaths, [220] 6,242 injured, [221] and 2,553 people missing [222] There were 10,567 deaths in Miyagi, 5,145 in Iwate, 3,920 in Fukushima, 66 in Ibaraki, 22 in Chiba, eight in Tokyo, six in Kanagawa, four in Tochigi, three each in Aomori and Yamagata, and one each in Gunma, Saitama and Hokkaido [43] The leading causes of death were drowning (90.64% or 14,308 bodies), burning (0.9% or 145 bodies) and others (4.2% or 667 bodies, mostly crushed by heavy objects) [219] Injuries related to nuclear exposure or the discharge of radioactive water in Fukushima are difficult to trace as 60% of the 20,000 workers on-site declined to participate in state-sponsored free health checks [223]\n\n\nElsewhere across the Pacific\nThe Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) in Hawaii issued tsunami watches and announcements for locations in the Pacific At 07:30 UTC, PTWC issued a widespread tsunami warning covering the entire Pacific Ocean [189] [190] Russia evacuated 11,000 residents from coastal areas of the Kuril Islands [191] The United States National Tsunami Warning Center issued a tsunami warning for the coastal areas in most of California, all of Oregon, and the western part of Alaska, and a tsunami advisory covering the Pacific coastlines of most of Alaska, and all of Washington and British Columbia, Canada [192] [193] In California and Oregon, up to 2.4 m-high (7.9 ft) tsunami waves hit some areas, damaging docks and harbors and causing over US$10 million in damage [194] In Curry County, Oregon, US$7 million in damage occurred including the destruction of 1,100 m (3,600 ft) of docks at the Brookings harbor; the county received over US$1 million in FEMA emergency grants from the US Federal Government [195] Surges of up to 1 m (3 ft 3 in) hit Vancouver Island in Canada [193] [failed verification] prompting some evacuations, and causing boats to be banned from the waters surrounding the island for 12 hours following the wave strike, leaving many island residents in the area without means of getting to work [196] [197]\n\n\nNorway\nOn the day of the earthquake, the waters of several fjords across Norway appeared to seethe as if boiling, and formed waves that rolled onto shores, most prominently in Sognefjorden, where the phenomenon was caught on film After two years of research, scientists concluded that the massive earthquake also triggered these surprise seiche waves thousands of kilometers away [217] [218]\n\n\nCasualties\nThe official figures released in 2021 reported 19,759 deaths, [220] 6,242 injured, [221] and 2,553 people missing [222] There were 10,567 deaths in Miyagi, 5,145 in Iwate, 3,920 in Fukushima, 66 in Ibaraki, 22 in Chiba, eight in Tokyo, six in Kanagawa, four in Tochigi, three each in Aomori and Yamagata, and one each in Gunma, Saitama and Hokkaido [43] The leading causes of death were drowning (90.64% or 14,308 bodies), burning (0.9% or 145 bodies) and others (4.2% or 667 bodies, mostly crushed by heavy objects) [219] Injuries related to nuclear exposure or the discharge of radioactive water in Fukushima are difficult to trace as 60% of the 20,000 workers on-site declined to participate in state-sponsored free health checks [223]\n\n\nJapan\nThe official figures released in 2021 reported 19,759 deaths, [220] 6,242 injured, [221] and 2,553 people missing [222] There were 10,567 deaths in Miyagi, 5,145 in Iwate, 3,920 in Fukushima, 66 in Ibaraki, 22 in Chiba, eight in Tokyo, six in Kanagawa, four in Tochigi, three each in Aomori and Yamagata, and one each in Gunma, Saitama and Hokkaido [43] The

exposure or the discharge of radioactive water in Fukushima are difficult to trace as 60% of the 20,000 workers on-site declined to participate in state-sponsored free health checks [223]\n\n\nKey statistics\nThe official figures released in 2021 reported 19,759 deaths, [220] 6,242 injured, [221] and 2,553 people missing [222] There were 10,567 deaths in Miyagi, 5,145 in Iwate, 3,920 in Fukushima, 66 in Ibaraki, 22 in Chiba, eight in Tokyo, six in Kanagawa, four in Tochigi, three each in Aomori and Yamagata, and one each in Gunma, Saitama and Hokkaido [43] The leading causes of death

radioactive water in Fukushima are difficult to trace as 60% of the 20,000 workers on-site declined to participate in state-sponsored free health checks [223]\n\n\nOthers\nSave the Children reports that as many as 100,000 children were uprooted from their homes, some of whom were separated from their families because the earthquake occurred during the school day [229] 236 children were orphaned in the prefectures of Iwate, Miyagi and Fukushima by the disaster; [230] [231] 1,580 children lost either one or both parents, [232] 846 in Miyagi, 572 in Iwate, and 162 in Fukushima [233] The quake and tsunami killed 378 elementary, middle-school, and high school students and left 158 others missing [234] One elementary school in Ishinomaki, Miyagi, Okawa Elementary School, lost 74 of 108 students and 10 of 13 teachers in the tsunami due to poor decision making in evacuation [41] [235] [236] [237]\n\n\nOverseas\nThe tsunami was reported to have caused several deaths outside Japan One man was killed in Jayapura, Papua, Indonesia after being swept out to sea [13] A man who is said to have been attempting to photograph the oncoming tsunami at the mouth of the Klamath River, south of Crescent City, California, was swept out to sea [251] His body was found on 2 April 2011 along Ocean Beach in Fort Stevens State Park, Oregon, 530 km (330 mi) to the north [14]\n\n\nDamage and effects\nThe degree and extent of damage caused by the earthquake and resulting tsunami were enormous, with most of the damage being caused by the tsunami Video footage of the towns that were worst affected shows little more than piles of rubble, with almost no parts of any structures left standing [252] Estimates of the cost of the damage range well into the tens of billions of US dollars; before-and-after satellite photographs of devastated regions show immense damage to many regions [253] [254] Although Japan has invested the equivalent of billions of dollars on anti-tsunami seawalls which line at least 40% of its 34,751 km (21,593 mi) coastline and stand up to 12 m (39 ft) high, the tsunami simply washed over the top of some seawalls, collapsing some in the process [255]\n\n\nWeather conditions\nLow temperature and snowfall were major concerns after the earthquake [265] Snow arrived minutes before or after the tsunami, depending on locations [41] In Ishinomaki, the city which suffered the most deaths, [43] a temperature of 0 °C (32 °F) was measured, and it began to snow within a couple of hours of the earthquake [44] [41] Major snow fell again on 16 March, [42] [266] and intermittently in the coming weeks [267] 18 March was the coldest of that month, recording −4 to 6 °C (25 to 43 °F) in Sendai [267] [42] Photos of city ruins covered with snow were featured in various photo albums in international media, including NASA [268] [269] [270]\n\n\nWaste\nThe tsunami produced huge amounts of debris: estimates of 5 million tonnes of waste were reported by the Japanese Ministry of the Environment Some of this waste, mostly plastic and styrofoam washed up on the coasts of Canada and the United States in late 2011 Along the west coast of the United States, this increased the amount of litter by a factor of ten and may have transported alien species [271]\n\n\nPorts\nAll of Japan's ports were briefly shut down after the earthquake, though the ones in Tokyo and southwards soon re-opened Fifteen ports were located in the disaster zone The north eastern ports of Hachinohe, Sendai, Ishinomaki and Onahama were destroyed, while the Port of Chiba (which serves the hydrocarbon industry) and Japan's ninth-largest container port at Kashima were also affected, though less severely The ports at Hitachinaka, Hitachi, Soma, Shiogama, Kesennuma, Ofunato, Kamashi and Miyako were also damaged and closed to ships [272] All 15 ports reopened to limited ship traffic by 29 March 2011 [273] A total of 319 fishing ports, about 10% of Japan's fishing ports, were damaged in the disaster [274] Most were restored to operating condition by 18 April 2012 [275]\n\n\nDams and water problems\nThe Fujinuma irrigation dam in Sukagawa ruptured, [278] causing flooding and the washing away of five homes [279] Eight people were missing and four bodies were discovered by the morning [280] [281] [282] Reportedly, some locals had attempted to repair leaks in the dam before it completely failed [283] On 12 March 252 dams were inspected and it was discovered that six embankment dams had shallow cracks on their crests The reservoir at one concrete gravity dam suffered a small non-serious slope failure All damaged dams are functioning with no problems Four dams within the quake area were unreachable [284]\n\n\nElectricity\nAccording to the Japanese trade ministry, around 4.4 million households served by Tōhoku Electric Power (TEP) in northeastern Japan were left without electricity [287] Several nuclear and conventional power plants went offline, reducing the Tokyo Electric Power Company's (TEPCO) total capacity by 21 GW [288] Rolling blackouts began on 14 March due to power shortages caused by the earthquake [289] TEPCO, which normally provides approximately 40 GW of electricity, announced that it could only provide about 30 GW, because 40% of the electricity used in the greater Tokyo area was supplied by reactors in the Niigata and Fukushima prefectures [290] The reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi and Fukushima Dai-ni plants were automatically taken offline when the first earthquake occurred and sustained major damage from the earthquake and subsequent tsunami Rolling blackouts of approximately three hours were experienced throughout April and May while TEPCO scrambled to find a temporary power solution The blackouts affected Tokyo, Kanagawa, Eastern Shizuoka, Yamanashi, Chiba, Ibaraki, Saitama, Tochigi, and Gunma prefectures [291] Voluntary reductions in electricity use by consumers in the Kanto area helped reduce the predicted frequency and duration of the blackouts [292] By 21 March 2011, the number of households in the north without electricity fell to 242,927 [286]\n\n\nOil, gas and coal\nA 220,000-barrel (35,000 m3)-per-day [305] oil refinery of Cosmo Oil Company was set on fire by the quake at Ichihara, Chiba Prefecture, to the east of Tokyo [306] [307] It was extinguished after ten days, injuring six people, and destroying storage tanks [308] Other refineries halted production due to safety checks and power loss [309] [310]\nIn Sendai, a 145,000-barrel (23,100 m3)-per-day refinery owned by the largest refiner in Japan, JX Nippon Oil & Energy, was also set ablaze by the quake [305] Workers were evacuated, [311] but tsunami warnings hindered efforts to extinguish the fire until 14 March, when officials planned to do so [305]\n\n\nNuclear power plants\nThe Fukushima Daiichi, Fukushima Daini, Onagawa Nuclear Power Plant and Tōkai nuclear power stations, consisting of a total eleven reactors, were automatically shut down following the earthquake [316] Higashidōri, also on the northeast coast, was already shut down for a periodic inspection Cooling is needed to remove decay heat after a Generation II reactor has been shut down, and to maintain spent fuel pools The backup cooling process is powered by emergency diesel generators at the plants and at Rokkasho nuclear reprocessing plant [317] At Fukushima Daiichi and Daini, tsunami waves overtopped seawalls and destroyed diesel backup power systems, leading to severe problems at Fukushima Daiichi, including three large explosions and radioactive leakage Subsequent analysis found that many Japanese nuclear plants, including Fukushima Daiichi, were not adequately protected against tsunamis [318] Over 200,000 people were evacuated [319]\n\n\nFukushima meltdowns\nJapan declared a state of emergency following the failure of the cooling system at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, resulting in the evacuation of nearby residents [323] [324] [325] Officials from the Japanese Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency reported that radiation levels inside the plant were up to 1,000 times normal levels, [326] and that radiation levels outside the plant were up to eight times normal levels [327] Later, a state of emergency was also declared at the Fukushima Daini nuclear power plant about 11 km (6.8 mi) south [328] Experts described the Fukushima disaster was not as bad as the Chernobyl disaster, but worse than the Three Mile Island accident [329]\n\n\nIncidents elsewhere\nA fire occurred in the turbine section of the Onagawa Nuclear Power Plant following the earthquake [317] [338] The blaze was in a building housing the turbine, which is sited separately from the plant's reactor, [323] and was soon extinguished [339] The plant was shut down as a precaution [340]\n\n\nTransport\nJapan's transport network suffered severe disruptions Many sections of Tōhoku Expressway serving northern Japan were damaged The expressway did not reopen to general public use until 24 March 2011 [347] [348] All railway services were suspended in Tokyo, with an estimated 20,000 people stranded at major stations across the city [349] In the hours after the earthquake, some train services were resumed [350] Most Tokyo area train lines resumed full service by the next day—12 March [351] Twenty thousand stranded visitors spent the night of 11–12 March inside Tokyo Disneyland [352]\n\n\nTelecommunications\nCellular and landline phone service suffered major disruptions in the affected area [366] Immediately after the earthquake cellular communication was jammed across much of Japan due to a surge of network activity On the day of the quake itself American broadcaster NPR was unable to reach anyone in Sendai with a working phone or access to the Internet [367] Internet services were largely unaffected in areas where basic infrastructure remained, despite the earthquake having damaged portions of several undersea cable systems landing in the affected regions; these systems were able to reroute around affected segments onto redundant links [368] [369] Within Japan, only a few websites were initially unreachable [370] Several Wi-Fi hotspot providers reacted to the quake by providing free access to their networks, [370] and some American telecommunications and VoIP companies such as AT&T, Sprint, Verizon, [371] T-Mobile [372] and VoIP companies such as netTALK [373] and Vonage [374] have offered free calls to (and in some cases, from) Japan for a limited time, as did Germany's Deutsche Telekom [375]\n\n\nDefense\nMatsushima Air Field of the Japan Self-Defense Force in Miyagi Prefecture received a tsunami warning, and the airbase public address 'Tanoy' was used to give the warning: 'A tsunami is coming evacuate to the third floor.' Shortly after the warning the airbase was struck by the tsunami, flooding the base There was no loss of life, although the tsunami resulted in damage to all 18 Mitsubishi F-2 fighter jets of the 21st Fighter Training Squadron [376] [377] [378] Twelve of the aircraft were scrapped, while the remaining six were slated for repair at a cost of 80 billion yen ($1 billion), exceeding the original cost of the aircraft [379] After the tsunami, elements of the Japanese Maritime Self-Defence Force put to sea without orders and started rescuing those who had been washed out to sea Tsunami plans were for the Japanese Self-Defence Force assets to be led, directed, and coordinated by local civic governments However, the earthquake destroyed town halls (the seat of local municipal government), police, and fire services in many places, so the military not only had to respond to but also command rescues.\n\n\nCultural properties\n754 cultural properties were damaged across nineteen prefectures, including five National Treasures (at Zuigan-ji, Ōsaki Hachiman-gū, Shiramizu Amidadō, and Seihaku-ji); 160 Important Cultural Properties (including at Sendai Tōshō-gū, the Kōdōkan, and Entsū-in, with its Western decorative motifs); 144 Monuments of Japan (including Matsushima, Takata-matsubara, Yūbikan, and the Site of Tagajō); six Groups of Traditional Buildings; and four Important Tangible Folk Cultural Properties Stone monuments at the UNESCO World Heritage Site: Shrines and Temples of Nikkō were toppled [380] [381] [382] In Tokyo, there was damage to Koishikawa Kōrakuen, Rikugien, Hamarikyū Onshi Teien, and the walls of Edo Castle [383] Information on the condition of collections held by museums, libraries and archives is still incomplete [384] There was no damage to the Historic Monuments and Sites of Hiraizumi in Iwate Prefecture, and the recommendation for their inscription on the UNESCO World Heritage List in June was seized upon as a symbol of international recognition and recovery [385]\n\n\nAftermath\nThe aftermath of the earthquake and tsunami included a humanitarian crisis and a major economic impact The tsunami resulted in over 340,000 displaced people in the Tōhoku region, and shortages of food, water, shelter, medicine, and fuel for survivors In response, the Japanese government mobilized the Self-Defence Forces (under Joint Task Force – Tōhoku, led by Lieutenant General Eiji Kimizuka), while many countries sent search and rescue teams to help search for survivors Aid organizations in Japan and worldwide responded, with the Japanese Red Cross reporting $1 billion in donations The economic impact included immediate problems, with industrial production suspended in many factories, and the longer term issue of the cost of rebuilding, which has been estimated at ¥10 trillion ($122 billion) In comparison to the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake, the East Japan earthquake brought serious damage to an extremely wide range [386]\n\n\nScientific and research response\nSeismologists anticipated a very large quake would strike in the same place as the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake—in the Sagami Trough, southwest of Tokyo [390] [391] The Japanese government had tracked plate movements since 1976 in preparation for the so-called Tokai earthquake, predicted to take place in that region [392] However, occurring as it did 373 km (232 mi) north east of Tokyo, the Tōhoku earthquake came as a surprise to seismologists While the Japan Trench was known for creating large quakes, it had not been expected to generate quakes above an 8.0 magnitude [391] [392] The Headquarters for Earthquake Research Promotion set up by the Japanese government then reassessed the long-term risk of trench-type earthquakes around Japan, and it was announced in November 2011 that research on the 869 Sanriku earthquake indicated that a similar earthquake with a magnitude of Mw 8.4–9.0 would take place off the Pacific coast of northeastern Japan, on average, every 600 years Also, a tsunami-earthquake with a tsunami magnitude scales (Mt) between 8.6 and 9.0 (Similar to the 1896 Sanriku earthquake, the Mt for the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake was 9.1–9.4) had a 30% chance to occur within 30 years [393] [394]\n\n\nEcological research\nThe 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami had a great environmental impact on Japan's eastern coast The rarity and magnitude of the earthquake-tsunami prompted researchers Jotaro Urabe, Takao Suzuki, Tatsuki Nishita, and Wataru Makino to study their immediate ecological impacts on intertidal flat communities at Sendai Bay and the Sanriku Ria coast Pre- and post-event surveys show a reduction in animal taxon richness and change in taxon composition mainly attributed to the tsunami and its physical impacts In particular, sessile epibenthic animals and endobenthic animals both decreased in taxon richness Mobile epibenthic animals, such as hermit crabs, were not as affected Post-surveys also recorded taxa that were not previously recorded before, suggesting that tsunamis have the potential to introduce species and change taxon composition and local community structure The long term ecological impacts at Sendai Bay and the greater east coast of Japan require further study [401]\n\n\nSee also\n3.11 and aftermath\n\n\nExplanatory notes\n This article incorporates text from a free content work

coast of Japan on March 11, 2011. The earthquake, with a magnitude of 9.1 (Mw), was one of the largest in recorded history, and the subsequent tsunami caused widespread destruction and loss of life.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami was a catastrophic event that shook the world. The epicenter of the earthquake was located off the coast of northeastern Japan, triggering a massive tsunami that destroyed entire cities and towns. The disaster resulted in over 19,000 deaths, 6,000 injuries, and 2,500 people missing. The economic impact was also significant, with estimates suggesting that the cost of rebuilding and recovery would be over $200 billion.\n\n**Earthquake**\n\nThe earthquake occurred at 14:46 JST (05:46 UTC) on March 11, 2011, at a relatively shallow depth of 32 km (20 mi) in the north-western Pacific Ocean. The epicenter was approximately 72 km (45 mi) east of the Oshika Peninsula of Tōhoku, Japan. The earthquake was initially reported as 7.9 Mw by the USGS before it was quickly upgraded to 8.8 Mw, then to 8.9 Mw, and finally to 9.0 Mw. On July 11, 2016, the USGS further upgraded the earthquake to 9.1.\n\n**Geology**\n\nThis megathrust earthquake was a recurrence of the mechanism of the earlier 869 Sanriku earthquake, which has been estimated as having a magnitude of at least 8.4 Mw. The 869 Sanriku earthquake also created a large tsunami that inundated the Sendai plain. Three tsunami deposits have been identified within the Holocene sequence of the plain, all formed within the last 3,000 years, suggesting an 800 to 1,100 year recurrence interval for large tsunamigenic earthquakes.\n\n**Energy**\n\nThe surface energy of the seismic waves from the earthquake was calculated to be 1.9×10^17 joules, which is nearly double that of the 9.1 Mw 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami that killed 230,000 people. If harnessed, the seismic energy from this earthquake would power a city the size of Los Angeles for an entire year.\n\n**Intensity**\n\nThe strong ground motion registered at the maximum of 7 on the Japan Meteorological Agency seismic intensity scale in Kurihara, Miyagi Prefecture. Three other prefectures—Fukushima, Ibaraki and Tochigi—recorded a 6 upper on the JMA scale. Seismic stations in Iwate, Gunma, Saitama and Chiba Prefecture measured a 6 lower, recording a 5 upper in Tokyo.\n\n**Geophysical effects**\n\nPortions of northeastern Japan shifted by as much as 2.4 meters (7 ft 10 in) closer to North America, making some sections of Japan's landmass wider than before. Those areas of Japan closest to the epicenter experienced the largest shifts. A 400-kilometer (250 mi) stretch of coastline dropped vertically by 0.6 meters (2 ft 0 in), allowing the tsunami to travel farther and faster onto land.\n\n**Aftershocks**\n\nJapan experienced over 1,000 aftershocks since the earthquake, with 80 registering over magnitude 6.0 Mw and several of which have been over magnitude 7.0 Mw.\n\n**Land subsidence**\n\nThe Geospatial Information Authority of Japan reported land subsidence based on the height of triangulation stations in the area measured by GPS as compared to their previous values from 14 April 2011.\n\n**Earthquake Warning System**\n\nOne minute before the earthquake was felt in Tokyo, the Earthquake Early Warning system, which includes more than 1,000 seismometers in Japan, sent out warnings of impending strong shaking to millions. The warning for the general public was delivered about eight seconds after the first P-wave was detected, or about 31 seconds after the earthquake occurred.\n\n**Tsunami**\n\nAn upthrust of 6 to 8 meters (20 to 26 ft) along a 180-kilometer (110 mi)-wide seabed at 60 kilometers (37 mi) offshore from the east coast of Tōhoku resulted in a major tsunami that brought destruction along the Pacific coastline of Japan's northern islands.\n\n**Japan**\n\nThe official figures released in 2021 reported 19,759 deaths, 6,242 injuries, and 2,553 people missing. There were 10,567 deaths in Miyagi, 5,145 in Iwate, 3,920 in Fukushima, 66 in Ibaraki, 22 in Chiba, 8 in Tokyo, 6 in Kanagawa, 4 in Tochigi, 3 each in Aomori and Yamagata, and 1 each in Gunma, Saitama, and Hokkaido.\n\n**Elsewhere across the Pacific**\n\nThe Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii issued tsunami watches and announcements for locations in the Pacific. Russia evacuated 11,000 residents from coastal areas of the Kuril Islands. The United States National Tsunami Warning Center issued a tsunami warning for the coastal areas in most of California, all of Oregon, and the western part of Alaska, and a tsunami advisory covering the Pacific coastlines of most of Alaska, and all of Washington and British Columbia, Canada.\n\n**Damage and effects**\n\nThe degree and extent of damage caused by the earthquake and resulting tsunami were enormous, with most of the damage being caused by the tsunami. Video footage of the towns that were worst affected shows little more than piles of rubble, with almost no parts of any structures left standing.\n\n**Transport**\n\nJapan's transport network suffered severe disruptions. Many sections of Tōhoku Expressway serving northern Japan were damaged. The expressway did not reopen to general public use until 24 March 2011.\n\n**Telecommunications**\n\nCellular and landline phone service suffered major disruptions in the affected area. Immediately after the earthquake, cellular communication was jammed across much of Japan due to a surge of network activity.\n\n**Defense**\n\nMatsushima Air Field of the Japan Self-Defence Force in Miyagi Prefecture received a tsunami warning, and the airbase public address 'Tanoy' was used to give the warning: 'A tsunami is coming evacuate to the third floor.' Shortly after the warning the airbase was struck by the tsunami, flooding the base.\n\n**Cultural properties**\n\n754 cultural properties were damaged across nineteen prefectures, including five National Treasures, 160 Important Cultural Properties, 144 Monuments of Japan, six Groups of Traditional Buildings, and four Important Tangible Folk Cultural Properties.\n\n**Scientific and research response**\n\nSeismologists anticipated a very large quake would strike in the same place as the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake—in the Sagami Trough, southwest of Tokyo. However, occurring as it did 373 kilometers (232 miles) north east of Tokyo, the Tōhoku earthquake came as a surprise to seismologists.\n\n**Ecological research**\n\nThe 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami had a great environmental impact on Japan's eastern coast. The rarity and magnitude of the earthquake-tsunami prompted researchers to study their immediate ecological impacts on intertidal flat communities at Sendai Bay and the Sanriku Ria coast.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami was a catastrophic event that shook the world. The earthquake, with a magnitude of 9.1 (Mw), was one of the largest in recorded history, and the subsequent tsunami caused widespread destruction and loss of life. The economic impact was also significant, with estimates suggesting that the cost of rebuilding and recovery would be over $200 billion.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2011_Tōhoku_earthquake_and_tsunami\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarthquake\nThe magnitude 9.1 (Mw) undersea megathrust earthquake occurred on 11 March 2011 at 14:46 JST (05:46 UTC) in the north-western Pacific Ocean at a relatively shallow depth of 32 km (20 mi), [9] [56] with its epicenter approximately 72 km (45 mi) east of the Oshika Peninsula of Tōhoku, Japan, lasting approximately six minutes [9] [10] The earthquake was initially reported as 7.9 Mw by the USGS before it was quickly upgraded to 8.8 Mw, then to 8.9 Mw, [57] and then finally to 9.0 Mw [58] [59] On 11 July 2016, the USGS further upgraded the earthquake to 9.1 Sendai was the nearest major city to the earthquake, 130 km (81 mi) from the epicenter; the earthquake occurred 373 km (232 mi) northeast of Tokyo [9]\n\n\nGeology\nThis megathrust earthquake was a recurrence of the mechanism of the earlier 869 Sanriku earthquake, which has been estimated as having a magnitude of at least 8.4 Mw, which also created a large tsunami that inundated the Sendai plain [39] [74] [75] Three tsunami deposits have been identified within the Holocene sequence of the plain, all formed within the last 3,000 years, suggesting an 800 to 1,100 year recurrence interval for large tsunamigenic earthquakes In 2001 it was reckoned that there was a high likelihood of a large tsunami hitting the Sendai plain as more than 1,100 years had then elapsed [76] In 2007, the probability of an earthquake with a magnitude of Mw 8.1–8.3 was estimated as 99% within the following 30 years [77]\n\n\nEnergy\nThe surface energy of the seismic waves from the earthquake was calculated to be 1.9×1017 joules, [86] which is nearly double that of the 9.1 Mw 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami that killed 230,000 people If harnessed, the seismic energy from this earthquake would power a city the size of Los Angeles for an entire year [64] The seismic moment (M0), which represents a physical size for the event, was calculated by the USGS at 3.9×1022 joules, [87] slightly less than the 2004 Indian Ocean quake.\n\n\nIntensity\nThe strong ground motion registered at the maximum of 7 on the Japan Meteorological Agency seismic intensity scale in Kurihara, Miyagi Prefecture [92] Three other prefectures—Fukushima, Ibaraki and Tochigi—recorded a 6 upper on the JMA scale Seismic stations in Iwate, Gunma, Saitama and Chiba Prefecture measured a 6 lower, recording a 5 upper in Tokyo.\n\n\nGeophysical effects\nPortions of northeastern Japan shifted by as much as 2.4 meters (7 ft 10 in) closer to North America, [65] [66] making some sections of Japan's landmass wider than before [66] Those areas of Japan closest to the epicenter experienced the largest shifts [66] A 400-kilometer (250 mi) stretch of coastline dropped vertically by 0.6 meters (2 ft 0 in), allowing the tsunami to travel farther and faster onto land [66] One early estimate suggested that the Pacific plate may have moved westward by up to 20 meters (66 ft), [94] and another early estimate put the amount of slippage at as much as 40 m (130 ft) [95] On 6 April, the Japanese coast guard said that the quake shifted the seabed near the epicenter 24 meters (79 ft) and elevated the seabed off the coast of Miyagi Prefecture by 3 meters (9.8 ft) [96] A report by the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology, published in Science on 2 December 2011, concluded that the seabed in the area between the epicenter and the Japan Trench moved 50 meters (160 ft) east-southeast and rose about 7 meters (23 ft) as a result of the quake The report also stated that the quake had caused several major landslides on the seabed in the affected area [97]\n\n\nAftershocks\nJapan experienced over 1,000 aftershocks since the earthquake, with 80 registering over magnitude 6.0 Mw and several of which have been over magnitude 7.0 Mw.\n\n\nLand subsidence\nThe Geospatial Information Authority of Japan reported land subsidence based on the height of triangulation stations in the area measured by GPS as compared to their previous values from 14 April 2011 [123]\n\n\nEarthquake Warning System\nOne minute before the earthquake was felt in Tokyo, the Earthquake Early Warning system, which includes more than 1,000 seismometers in Japan, sent out warnings of impending strong shaking to millions It is believed that the early warning by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) saved many lives [126] [127] The warning for the general public was delivered about eight seconds after the first P-wave was detected, or about 31 seconds after the earthquake occurred However, the estimated intensities were smaller than the actual ones in some places, especially in Kanto, Koshinetsu, and Northern Tōhoku regions where the populace warning did not trigger According to the Japan Meteorological Agency, reasons for the underestimation include a saturated magnitude scale when using maximum amplitude as input, failure to fully take into account the area of the hypocenter, and the initial amplitude of the earthquake being less than that which would be predicted by an empirical relationship [128] [129] [130] [131]\n\n\nTsunami\nAn upthrust of 6 to 8 meters (20 to 26 ft) along a 180-kilometer (110 mi)-wide seabed at 60 kilometers (37 mi) offshore from the east coast of Tōhoku [134] resulted in a major tsunami that brought destruction along the Pacific coastline of Japan's northern islands Thousands of people died and entire towns were devastated The tsunami propagated throughout the Pacific Ocean region reaching the entire Pacific coast of North and South America from Alaska to Chile Warnings were issued and evacuations were carried out in many countries bordering the Pacific Although the tsunami affected many of these places, the heights of the waves were minor [135] [136] [137] Chile's Pacific coast, one of the farthest from Japan at about 17,000 kilometers (11,000 mi) away, was struck by waves 2 meters (6.6 ft) high, [138] [139] [140] compared with an estimated wave height of 38.9 meters (128 ft) at Omoe peninsula, Miyako city, Japan [38]\n\n\nJapan\nThe official figures released in 2021 reported 19,759 deaths, [220] 6,242 injured, [221] and 2,553 people missing [222] There were 10,567 deaths in Miyagi, 5,145 in Iwate, 3,920 in Fukushima, 66 in Ibaraki, 22 in Chiba, eight in Tokyo, six in Kanagawa, four in Tochigi, three each in Aomori and Yamagata, and one each in Gunma, Saitama and Hokkaido [43] The leading causes of death were drowning (90.64% or 14,308 bodies), burning (0.9% or 145 bodies) and others (4.2% or 667 bodies, mostly crushed by heavy objects) [219] Injuries related to nuclear exposure or the discharge of radioactive water in Fukushima are difficult to trace as 60% of the 20,000 workers on-site declined to participate in state-sponsored free health checks [223]\n\n\nElsewhere across the Pacific\nThe Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) in Hawaii issued tsunami watches and announcements for locations in the Pacific At 07:30 UTC, PTWC issued a widespread tsunami warning covering the entire Pacific Ocean [189] [190] Russia evacuated 11,000 residents from coastal areas of the Kuril Islands [191] The United States National Tsunami Warning Center issued a tsunami warning for the coastal areas in most of California, all of Oregon, and the western part of Alaska, and a tsunami advisory covering the Pacific coastlines of most of Alaska, and all of Washington and British Columbia, Canada [192] [193] In California and Oregon, up to 2.4 m-high (7.9 ft) tsunami waves hit some areas, damaging docks and harbors and causing over US$10 million in damage [194] In Curry County, Oregon, US$7 million in damage occurred including the destruction of 1,100 m (3,600 ft) of docks at the Brookings harbor; the county received over US$1 million in FEMA emergency grants from the US Federal Government [195] Surges of up to 1 m (3 ft 3 in) hit Vancouver Island in Canada [193] [failed verification] prompting some evacuations, and causing boats to be banned from the waters surrounding the island for 12 hours following the wave strike, leaving many island residents in the area without means of getting to work [196] [197]\n\n\nNorway\nOn the day of the earthquake, the waters of several fjords across Norway appeared to seethe as if boiling, and formed waves that rolled onto shores, most prominently in Sognefjorden, where the phenomenon was caught on film After two years of research, scientists concluded that the massive earthquake also triggered these surprise seiche waves thousands of kilometers away [217] [218]\n\n\nCasualties\nThe official figures released in 2021 reported 19,759 deaths, [220] 6,242 injured, [221] and 2,553 people missing [222] There were 10,567 deaths in Miyagi, 5,145 in Iwate, 3,920 in Fukushima, 66 in Ibaraki, 22 in Chiba, eight in Tokyo, six in Kanagawa, four in Tochigi, three each in Aomori and Yamagata, and one each in Gunma, Saitama and Hokkaido [43] The leading causes of death were drowning (90.64% or 14,308 bodies), burning (0.9% or 145 bodies) and others (4.2% or 667 bodies, mostly crushed by heavy objects)

radioactive water in Fukushima are difficult to trace as 60% of the 20,000 workers on-site declined to participate in state-sponsored free health checks [223]\n\n\nOthers\nSave the Children reports that as many as 100,000 children were uprooted from their homes, some of whom were separated from their families because the earthquake occurred during the school day [229] 236 children were orphaned in the prefectures of Iwate, Miyagi and Fukushima by the disaster; [230] [231] 1,580 children lost either one or both parents, [232] 846 in Miyagi, 572 in Iwate, and 162 in Fukushima [233] The quake and tsunami killed 378 elementary, middle-school, and high school students and left 158 others missing [234] One elementary school in Ishinomaki, Miyagi, Okawa Elementary School, lost 74 of 108 students and 10 of 13 teachers in the tsunami due to poor decision making in evacuation [41] [235] [236] [237]\n\n\nOverseas\nThe tsunami was reported to have caused several deaths outside Japan One man was killed in Jayapura, Papua, Indonesia after being swept out to sea [13] A man who is said to have been attempting to photograph the oncoming tsunami at the mouth of the Klamath River, south of Crescent City, California, was swept out to sea [251] His body was found on 2 April 2011 along Ocean Beach in Fort Stevens State Park, Oregon, 530 km (330 mi) to the north [14]\n\n\nDamage and effects\nThe degree and extent of damage caused by the earthquake and resulting tsunami were enormous, with most of the damage being caused by the tsunami Video footage of the towns that were worst affected shows little more than piles of rubble, with almost no parts of any structures left standing [252] Estimates of the cost of the damage range well into the tens of billions of US dollars; before-and-after satellite photographs of devastated regions show immense damage to many regions [253] [254] Although Japan has invested the equivalent of billions of dollars on anti-tsunami seawalls which line at least 40% of its 34,751 km (21,593 mi) coastline and stand up to 12 m (39 ft) high, the tsunami simply washed over the top of some seawalls, collapsing some in the process [255]\n\n\nWeather conditions\nLow temperature and snowfall were major concerns after the earthquake [265] Snow arrived minutes before or after the tsunami, depending on locations [41] In Ishinomaki, the city which suffered the most deaths, [43] a temperature of 0 °C (32 °F) was measured, and it began to snow within a couple of hours of the earthquake [44] [41] Major snow fell again on 16 March, [42] [266] and intermittently in the coming weeks [267] 18 March was the coldest of that month, recording −4 to 6 °C (25 to 43 °F) in Sendai [267] [42] Photos of city ruins covered with snow were featured in various photo albums in international media, including NASA [268] [269] [270]\n\n\nWaste\nThe tsunami produced huge amounts of debris: estimates of 5 million tonnes of waste were reported by the Japanese Ministry of the Environment Some of this waste, mostly plastic and styrofoam washed up on the coasts of Canada and the United States in late 2011 Along the west coast of the United States, this increased the amount of litter by a factor of ten and may have transported alien species [271]\n\n\nPorts\nAll of Japan's ports were briefly shut down after the earthquake, though the ones in Tokyo and southwards soon re-opened Fifteen ports were located in the disaster zone The north eastern ports of Hachinohe, Sendai, Ishinomaki and Onahama were destroyed, while the Port of Chiba (which serves the hydrocarbon industry) and Japan's ninth-largest container port at Kashima were also affected, though less severely The ports at Hitachinaka, Hitachi, Soma, Shiogama, Kesennuma, Ofunato, Kamashi and Miyako were also damaged and closed to ships [272] All 15 ports reopened to limited ship traffic by 29 March 2011 [273] A total of 319 fishing ports, about 10% of Japan's fishing ports, were damaged in the disaster [274] Most were restored to operating condition by 18 April 2012 [275]\n\n\nDams and water problems\nThe Fujinuma irrigation dam in Sukagawa ruptured, [278] causing flooding and the washing away of five homes [279] Eight people were missing and four bodies were discovered by the morning [280] [281] [282] Reportedly, some locals had attempted to repair leaks in the dam before it completely failed [283] On 12 March 252 dams were inspected and it was discovered that six embankment dams had shallow cracks on their crests The reservoir at one concrete gravity dam suffered a small non-serious slope failure All damaged dams are functioning with no problems Four dams within the quake area were unreachable [284]\n\n\nElectricity\nAccording to the Japanese trade ministry, around 4.4 million households served by Tōhoku Electric Power (TEP) in northeastern Japan were left without electricity [287] Several nuclear and conventional power plants went offline, reducing the Tokyo Electric Power Company's (TEPCO) total capacity by 21 GW [288] Rolling blackouts began on 14 March due to power shortages caused by the earthquake [289] TEPCO, which normally provides approximately 40 GW of electricity, announced that it could only provide about 30 GW, because 40% of the electricity used in the greater Tokyo area was supplied by reactors in the Niigata and Fukushima prefectures [290] The reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi and Fukushima Dai-ni plants were automatically taken offline when the first earthquake occurred and sustained major damage from the earthquake and subsequent tsunami Rolling blackouts of approximately three hours were experienced throughout April and May while TEPCO scrambled to find a temporary power solution The blackouts affected Tokyo, Kanagawa, Eastern Shizuoka, Yamanashi, Chiba, Ibaraki, Saitama, Tochigi, and Gunma prefectures [291] Voluntary reductions in electricity use by consumers in the Kanto area helped reduce the predicted frequency and duration of the blackouts [292] By 21 March 2011, the number of households in the north without electricity fell to 242,927 [286]\n\n\nOil, gas and coal\nA 220,000-barrel (35,000 m3)-per-day [305] oil refinery of Cosmo Oil Company was set on fire by the quake at Ichihara, Chiba Prefecture, to the east of Tokyo [306] [307] It was extinguished after ten days, injuring six people, and destroying storage tanks [308] Other refineries halted production due to safety checks and power loss [309] [310]\nIn Sendai, a 145,000-barrel (23,100 m3)-per-day refinery owned by the largest refiner in Japan, JX Nippon Oil & Energy, was also set ablaze by the quake [305] Workers were evacuated, [311] but tsunami warnings hindered efforts to extinguish the fire until 14 March, when officials planned to do so [305]\n\n\nNuclear power plants\nThe Fukushima Daiichi, Fukushima Daini, Onagawa Nuclear Power Plant and Tōkai nuclear power stations, consisting of a total eleven reactors, were automatically shut down following the earthquake [316] Higashidōri, also on the northeast coast, was already shut down for a periodic inspection Cooling is needed to remove decay heat after a Generation II reactor has been shut down, and to maintain spent fuel pools The backup cooling process is powered by emergency diesel generators at the plants and at Rokkasho nuclear reprocessing plant [317] At Fukushima Daiichi and Daini, tsunami waves overtopped seawalls and destroyed diesel backup power systems, leading to severe problems at Fukushima Daiichi, including three large explosions and radioactive leakage Subsequent analysis found that many Japanese nuclear plants, including Fukushima Daiichi, were not adequately protected against tsunamis [318] Over 200,000 people were evacuated [319]\n\n\nFukushima meltdowns\nJapan declared a state of emergency following the failure of the cooling system at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, resulting in the evacuation of nearby residents [323] [324] [325] Officials from the Japanese Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency reported that radiation levels inside the plant were up to 1,000 times normal levels, [326] and that radiation levels outside the plant were up to eight times normal levels [327] Later, a state of emergency was also declared at the Fukushima Daini nuclear power plant about 11 km (6.8 mi) south [328] Experts described the Fukushima disaster was not as bad as the Chernobyl disaster, but worse than the Three Mile Island accident [329]\n\n\nIncidents elsewhere\nA fire occurred in the turbine section of the Onagawa Nuclear Power Plant following the earthquake [317] [338] The blaze was in a building housing the turbine, which is sited separately from the plant's reactor, [323] and was soon extinguished [339] The plant was shut down as a precaution [340]\n\n\nTransport\nJapan's transport network suffered severe disruptions Many sections of Tōhoku Expressway serving northern Japan were damaged The expressway did not reopen to general public use until 24 March 2011 [347] [348] All railway services were suspended in Tokyo, with an estimated 20,000 people stranded at major stations across the city [349] In the hours after the earthquake, some train services were resumed [350] Most Tokyo area train lines resumed full service by the next day—12 March [351] Twenty thousand stranded visitors spent the night of 11–12 March inside Tokyo Disneyland [352]\n\n\nTelecommunications\nCellular and landline phone service suffered major disruptions in the affected area [366] Immediately after the earthquake cellular communication was jammed across much of Japan due to a surge of network activity On the day of the quake itself American broadcaster NPR was unable to reach anyone in Sendai with a working phone or access to the Internet [367] Internet services were largely unaffected in areas where basic infrastructure remained, despite the earthquake having damaged portions of several undersea cable systems landing in the affected regions; these systems were able to reroute around affected segments onto redundant links [368] [369] Within Japan, only a few websites were initially unreachable [370] Several Wi-Fi hotspot providers reacted to the quake by providing free access to their networks, [370] and some American telecommunications and VoIP companies such as AT&T, Sprint, Verizon, [371] T-Mobile [372] and VoIP companies such as netTALK [373] and Vonage [374] have offered free calls to (and in some cases, from) Japan for a limited time, as did Germany's Deutsche Telekom [375]\n\n\nDefense\nMatsushima Air Field of the Japan Self-Defense Force in Miyagi Prefecture received a tsunami warning, and the airbase public address 'Tanoy' was used to give the warning: 'A tsunami is coming evacuate to the third floor.' Shortly after the warning the airbase was struck by the tsunami, flooding the base There was no loss of life, although the tsunami resulted in damage to all 18 Mitsubishi F-2 fighter jets of the 21st Fighter Training Squadron [376] [377] [378] Twelve of the aircraft were scrapped, while the remaining six were slated for repair at a cost of 80 billion yen ($1 billion), exceeding the original cost of the aircraft [379] After the tsunami, elements of the Japanese Maritime Self-Defence Force put to sea without orders and started rescuing those who had been washed out to sea Tsunami plans were for the Japanese Self-Defence Force assets to be led, directed, and coordinated by local civic governments However, the earthquake destroyed town halls (the seat of local municipal government), police, and fire services in many places, so the military not only had to respond to but also command rescues.\n\n\nCultural properties\n754 cultural properties were damaged across nineteen prefectures, including five National Treasures (at Zuigan-ji, Ōsaki Hachiman-gū, Shiramizu Amidadō, and Seihaku-ji); 160 Important Cultural Properties (including at Sendai Tōshō-gū, the Kōdōkan, and Entsū-in, with its Western decorative motifs); 144 Monuments of Japan (including Matsushima, Takata-matsubara, Yūbikan, and the Site of Tagajō); six Groups of Traditional Buildings; and four Important Tangible Folk Cultural Properties Stone monuments at the UNESCO World Heritage Site: Shrines and Temples of Nikkō were toppled [380] [381] [382] In Tokyo, there was damage to Koishikawa Kōrakuen, Rikugien, Hamarikyū Onshi Teien, and the walls of Edo Castle [383] Information on the condition of collections held by museums, libraries and archives is still incomplete [384] There was no damage to the Historic Monuments and Sites of Hiraizumi in Iwate Prefecture, and the recommendation for their inscription on the UNESCO World Heritage List in June was seized upon as a symbol of international recognition and recovery [385]\n\n\nAftermath\nThe aftermath of the earthquake and tsunami included a humanitarian crisis and a major economic impact The tsunami resulted in over 340,000 displaced people in the Tōhoku region, and shortages of food, water, shelter, medicine, and fuel for survivors In response, the Japanese government mobilized the Self-Defence Forces (under Joint Task Force – Tōhoku, led by Lieutenant General Eiji Kimizuka), while many countries sent search and rescue teams to help search for survivors Aid organizations in Japan and worldwide responded, with the Japanese Red Cross reporting $1 billion in donations The economic impact included immediate problems, with industrial production suspended in many factories, and the longer term issue of the cost of rebuilding, which has been estimated at ¥10 trillion ($122 billion) In comparison to the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake, the East Japan earthquake brought serious damage to an extremely wide range [386]\n\n\nScientific and research response\nSeismologists anticipated a very large quake would strike in the same place as the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake—in the Sagami Trough, southwest of Tokyo [390] [391] The Japanese government had tracked plate movements since 1976 in preparation for the so-called Tokai earthquake, predicted to take place in that region [392] However, occurring as it did 373 km (232 mi) north east of Tokyo, the Tōhoku earthquake came as a surprise to seismologists While the Japan Trench was known for creating large quakes, it had not been expected to generate quakes above an 8.0 magnitude [391] [392] The Headquarters for Earthquake Research Promotion set up by the Japanese government then reassessed the long-term risk of trench-type earthquakes around Japan, and it was announced in November 2011 that research on the 869 Sanriku earthquake indicated that a similar earthquake with a magnitude of Mw 8.4–9.0 would take place off the Pacific coast of northeastern Japan, on average, every 600 years Also, a tsunami-earthquake with a tsunami magnitude scales (Mt) between 8.6 and 9.0 (Similar to the 1896 Sanriku earthquake, the Mt for the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake was 9.1–9.4) had a 30% chance to occur within 30 years [393] [394]\n\n\nEcological research\nThe 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami had a great environmental impact on Japan's eastern coast The rarity and magnitude of the earthquake-tsunami prompted researchers Jotaro Urabe, Takao Suzuki, Tatsuki Nishita, and Wataru Makino to study their immediate ecological impacts on intertidal flat communities at Sendai Bay and the Sanriku Ria coast Pre- and post-event surveys show a reduction in animal taxon richness and change in taxon composition mainly attributed to the tsunami and its physical impacts In particular, sessile epibenthic animals and endobenthic animals both decreased in taxon richness Mobile epibenthic animals, such as hermit crabs, were not as affected Post-surveys also recorded taxa that were not previously recorded before, suggesting that tsunamis have the potential to introduce species and change taxon composition and local community structure The long term ecological impacts at Sendai Bay and the greater east coast of Japan require further study [401]\n\n\nSee also\n3.11 and aftermath\n\n\nExplanatory notes\n This article incorporates text from a free content work

He was born on 8 September 1999 in Fazilka, Punjab, India, into a Punjabi Sikh family. Gill's early life and cricketing career are marked by his dedication to the sport, which was encouraged by his father, Lakhwinder Singh, a farmer who had aspirations to become a cricketer himself.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nGill was born on 8 September 1999 in Fazilka, Punjab, India. His father, Lakhwinder Singh, was a farmer who had a passion for cricket. Recognizing his son's interest in the game, Lakhwinder decided to train him, bowling 500 to 700 balls to Gill daily from a young age. This early training helped Gill develop his skills and sparked a lifelong love for cricket.\n\nIn 2007, the Gill family moved to Mohali, near the Punjab Cricket Association Stadium, to facilitate better training opportunities for the young cricketer. This move proved to be a turning point in Gill's career, as it provided him with access to top-class coaching and facilities.\n\n**Domestic Career**\n\nGill made his List A debut for Punjab in the 2016-2017 Vijay Hazare Trophy on 25 February 2017 against Vidharbha. Although he scored only 11 runs before being run out, this marked the beginning of his first-class career.

This performance earned him recognition as a talented young batsman.\n\nLater in the same month, Gill made his first-class debut for Punjab against Bengal in the 2017-2018 Ranji Trophy on 17 November 2017.

He was instrumental in India's victory in the semifinal against Pakistan U-19, scoring 102* runs off 94 balls and earning the title of Player of the Match.\n\nGill was named vice-captain of India's squad for the 2018 Under-19 Cricket World Cup. He had a successful tournament, leading the team in runs scored with 372 runs and was also named the player of the tournament. Following India's matches in the tournament, the International Cricket Council (ICC) named Gill as the rising star of the squad.\n\n**Indian Premier League**\n\nIn January 2018, Gill was bought by the Kolkata Knight Riders for ₹1.8 crore (US$220,000) in the 2018 IPL auction. He made his Twenty20 debut for Kolkata Knight Riders in the 2018 Indian Premier League on 14 April 2018.

The film is based on the 1988 novel of the same name by Thomas Harris. It stars Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling, a young FBI trainee, and Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter, a brilliant and cannibalistic serial killer. The film follows Starling as she seeks the advice of Lecter to catch another serial killer known as \"Buffalo Bill,\" who is killing and skinning women.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film begins with a series of gruesome murders committed by a serial killer known as \"Buffalo Bill.\" The FBI is unable to catch the killer, and the public is terrified. The FBI director, Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn), assigns a young trainee, Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster), to interview the imprisoned Hannibal Lecter, a brilliant and cannibalistic serial killer. Crawford hopes that Lecter may be able to provide insights into the mind of Buffalo Bill, as both killers share similar characteristics.\n\nStarling visits Lecter in prison, where he is being held in a maximum-security cell. Despite his gruesome past, Lecter is highly intelligent and charismatic, and he is fascinated by Starling's determination and bravery. Lecter agrees to help Starling catch Buffalo Bill, but only if she agrees to play a game with him, which involves sharing details about her own traumatic childhood.\n\nAs Starling delves deeper into the case, she discovers that Buffalo Bill is a former soldier who is obsessed with the idea of transforming women into complete human skinsuits. She also discovers that Buffalo Bill's latest victim is a young woman named Catherine Martin (Brooke Smith), who is the daughter of a prominent Senator.\n\nAs the investigation unfolds, Starling becomes increasingly obsessed with catching Buffalo Bill, and she begins to uncover clues that suggest he may be hiding in plain sight. Meanwhile, Lecter continues to manipulate Starling and provide her with cryptic clues, which she must decipher in order to catch the killer.\n\n**Cast**\n\nThe film features a talented cast, including:\n\n* Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling\n* Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter\n* Scott Glenn as Jack Crawford\n* Brooke Smith as Catherine Martin\n* Ted Levine as Buffalo Bill\n* Anthony Heald as Frederick Chilton\n\nThe film was a critical and commercial success, and it marked a turning point in the careers of Foster and Hopkins. Foster's portrayal of Starling earned her an Academy Award for Best Actress, and Hopkins's portrayal of Lecter earned him an Academy Award for Best Actor.\n\n**Analysis**\n\nThe Silence of the Lambs is a masterclass in psychological tension and suspense. The film's slow-burning pace and atmospheric score create a sense of unease and anticipation, which is expertly manipulated by the film's writers and directors. The film's exploration of themes such as trauma, obsession, and the darker side of human nature is both thought-provoking and unnerving.\n\nThe film's use of symbolism and metaphor is also noteworthy. The character of Hannibal Lecter is a symbol of the darker side of human nature, and his cannibalistic tendencies serve as a metaphor for the way in which we consume and devour each other. Similarly, the character of Buffalo Bill is a symbol of the destructive power of obsession, and his desire to transform women into human skinsuits serves as a metaphor for the way in which we try to control and dominate others.\n\n**Production**\n\nThe film was produced by Edward Saxon, Kenneth Utt, and Ron Bozman, and it was directed by Jonathan Demme. The film was shot on location in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and it was edited by Craig McKay. The film's score was composed by Howard Shore, and it features a haunting and atmospheric soundtrack that perfectly complements the film's tense and suspenseful atmosphere.\n\n**Music**\n\nThe film's score was composed by Howard Shore, and it features a haunting and atmospheric soundtrack that perfectly complements the film's tense and suspenseful atmosphere. The score features a mix of orchestral and choral elements, and it includes a number of memorable themes and motifs.

The show was hosted and produced by Canadian games journalist Geoff Keighley, who returned as an executive producer alongside Kimmie Kim, and Richard Preuss and LeRoy Bennett returned as director and creative director, respectively.\n\n**Background**\n\nAs with previous iterations of The Game Awards, the 2022 show was hosted and produced by Canadian games journalist Geoff Keighley. He returned as an executive producer alongside Kimmie Kim, and Richard Preuss and LeRoy Bennett returned as director and creative director, respectively. Sydnee Goodman returned as host of the 30-minute preshow, rebranded as the Opening Act. The presentation took place at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles on December 8, 2022, and was live streamed across more than 40 online platforms and social media services, including Facebook, TikTok, Twitch, Twitter, and YouTube.\n\nThe show introduced Instagram Live worldwide and partnered with Tiki in India. For the first time since 2019, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the show opened its attendance to the public, allowing around 1,000 attendants. However, overall attendance was limited to a couple thousand to avoid further restrictions. Public tickets became available for purchase on November 1, although the show remained subject to change pending health and safety guidelines changes due to COVID-19 in California.\n\n**Announcements**\n\nKeighley estimated the show involved over 50 games, about 30 to 40 of which are announced games showing new content. The first clip of The Super Mario Bros Movie was revealed during the show. Announcements on released and upcoming games were made for several titles, including God of War Ragnarök, Elden Ring, and Horizon Forbidden West.\n\n**Stage interruption**\n\nAfter Elden Ring was announced as the Game of the Year winner, a male individual followed the developers on stage and waited while they gave their speech. As music began to play after director Hidetaka Miyazaki's speech, the individual approached the microphone and said, \"I want to thank everybody and say I think I want to nominate this award to my Reformed Orthodox rabbi Bill Clinton.\" During the 13-second speech, The Washington Post observed Keighley waving for security. Security escorted the individual off stage, and Keighley ended the show as planned. Minutes later, Keighley said the individual had been arrested, although the Los Angeles Police Department later stated no arrest was made but the individual had been detained and questioned at the venue by on-site police and security before being transported to a local police station.\n\n**Winners and nominees**\n\nNominees were announced on November 14, 2022. Any game released for public consumption on or before November 18, 2022, was eligible for consideration. The nominees were compiled by a jury panel composed of members from over 100 media outlets globally, including specialized juries for accessibility, adaptation, and esports awards. Winners were determined between the jury (90 percent) and public voting (10 percent), which was held via the official website and Discord server until December 7. According to Keighley, public voting within the first 24 hours increased 42 percent compared to The Game Awards 2021. Within the first week, 35 million votes had been submitted, more than double in the same period the previous year and exceeding 2021's total three-week count. When the polls closed, more than 55 million votes had been submitted, an increase of 138 percent over 2021.\n\n**Awards**\n\nWinners are listed first, highlighted in boldface, and indicated with a double dagger (‡).\n\n**Video games and media**\n\nGod of War Ragnarök led the show with eleven nominations, tied for the most in the show's history.

{"title": "Sherlock_Holmes", "content": "\nInspiration for the character\nEdgar Allan Poe's C Auguste Dupin is generally acknowledged as the first detective in fiction and served as the prototype for many later characters, including Holmes [8] Conan Doyle once wrote, \"Each  [of Poe's detective stories] is a root from which a whole literature has developed .. Where was the detective story until Poe breathed the breath of life into it?\" [9] Similarly, the stories of Émile Gaboriau's Monsieur Lecoq were extremely popular at the time Conan Doyle began writing Holmes, and Holmes's speech and behaviour sometimes follow those of Lecoq [10] [11] Doyle has his main characters discuss these literary antecedents near the beginning of A Study in Scarlet, which is set soon after Watson is first introduced to Holmes Watson attempts to compliment Holmes by comparing him to Dupin, to which Holmes replies that he found Dupin to be \"a very inferior fellow\" and Lecoq to be \"a miserable bungler\" [12]\n\n\nBiography\nDetails of Sherlock Holmes' life in Conan Doyle's stories are scarce and often vague Nevertheless, mentions of his early life and extended family paint a loose biographical picture of the detective.\n\n\nFamily and early life\nDetails of Sherlock Holmes' life in Conan Doyle's stories are scarce and often vague Nevertheless, mentions of his early life and extended family paint a loose biographical picture of the detective.\n\n\nLife with Watson\nIn the first Holmes tale, A Study in Scarlet, financial difficulties lead Holmes and Dr Watson to share rooms together at 221B Baker Street, London [25] Their residence is maintained by their landlady, Mrs Hudson [26] Holmes works as a detective for twenty-three years, with Watson assisting him for seventeen of those years [27] Most of the stories are frame narratives written from Watson's point of view, as summaries of the detective's most interesting cases Holmes frequently calls Watson's records of Holmes's cases sensational and populist, suggesting that they fail to accurately and objectively report the \"science\" of his craft:\n\n\nPractice\nHolmes' clients vary from the most powerful monarchs and governments of Europe, to wealthy aristocrats and industrialists, to impoverished pawnbrokers and governesses He is known only in select professional circles at the beginning of the first story, but is already collaborating with Scotland Yard However, his continued work and the publication of Watson's stories raise Holmes's profile, and he rapidly becomes well known as a detective; so many clients ask for his help instead of (or in addition to) that of the police [31] that, Watson writes, by 1887 \"Europe was ringing with his name\" [32] and by 1895 Holmes has \"an immense practice\" [33] Police outside London ask Holmes for assistance if he is nearby [34] A British prime minister [35] and the King of Bohemia [36] visit 221B Baker Street in person to request Holmes's assistance; the President of France awards him the Legion of Honour for capturing an assassin; [37] the King of Scandinavia is a client; [38] and he aids the Vatican at least twice [39] The detective acts on behalf of the British government in matters of national security several times [40] and declines a knighthood \"for services which may perhaps some day be described\" [41] However, he does not actively seek fame and is usually content to let the police take public credit for his work [42]\n\n\nThe Great Hiatus\nThe first set of Holmes stories was published between 1887 and 1893 Conan Doyle killed off Holmes in a final battle with the criminal mastermind Professor James Moriarty [43] in \"The Final Problem\" (published 1893, but set in 1891), as Conan Doyle felt that \"my literary energies should not be directed too much into one channel\" [44] However, the reaction of the public surprised him very much Distressed readers wrote anguished letters to The Strand Magazine, which suffered a terrible blow when 20,000 people cancelled their subscriptions to the magazine in protest [45] Conan Doyle himself received many protest letters, and one lady even began her letter with \"You brute\" [45] Legend has it that Londoners were so distraught upon hearing the news of Holmes's death that they wore black armbands in mourning, though there is no known contemporaneous source for this; the earliest known reference to such events comes from 1949 [46] However, the recorded public reaction to Holmes's death was unlike anything previously seen for fictional events [7]\n\n\nRetirement\nIn His Last Bow, the reader is told that Holmes has retired to a small farm on the Sussex Downs and taken up beekeeping as his primary occupation [50] The move is not dated precisely, but can be presumed to be no later than 1904 (since it is referred to retrospectively in \"The Adventure of the Second Stain\", first published that year) [51] The story features Holmes and Watson coming out of retirement to aid the British war effort Only one other adventure, \"The Adventure of the Lion's Mane\", takes place during the detective's retirement [52]\n\n\nPersonality and habits\nWatson describes Holmes as \"bohemian\" in his habits and lifestyle [53] Said to have a \"cat-like\" love of personal cleanliness, [54] at the same time Holmes is an eccentric with no regard for contemporary standards of tidiness or good order Watson describes him as\n\n\nDrug use\nHolmes occasionally uses addictive drugs, especially in the absence of stimulating cases [65] He sometimes used morphine and sometimes cocaine, the latter of which he injects in a seven-per cent solution; both drugs were legal in 19th-century England [66] [67] [68] As a physician, Watson strongly disapproves of his friend's cocaine habit, describing it as the detective's only vice, and concerned about its effect on Holmes's mental health and intellect [69] [70] In \"The Adventure of the Missing Three-Quarter\", Watson says that although he has \"weaned\" Holmes from drugs, the detective remains an addict whose habit is \"not dead, but merely sleeping\" [71]\n\n\nFinances\nHolmes is known to charge clients for his expenses and claim any reward offered for a problem's solution, such as in \"The Adventure of the Speckled Band\", \"The Red-Headed League\", and \"The Adventure of the Beryl Coronet\" The detective states at one point that \"My professional charges are upon a fixed scale I do not vary them, save when I remit them altogether.\" In this context, a client is offering to double his fee, and it is implied that wealthy clients habitually pay Holmes more than his standard rate [74] In \"The Adventure of the Priory School\", Holmes earns a £6,000 fee [75] (at a time where annual expenses for a rising young professional were in the area of £500) [76] However, Watson notes that Holmes would refuse to help even the wealthy and powerful if their cases did not interest him [77]\n\n\nAttitudes towards women\nAs Conan Doyle wrote to Joseph Bell, \"Holmes is as inhuman as a Babbage's Calculating Machine and just about as likely to fall in love.\" [78] Holmes says of himself that he is \"not a whole-souled admirer of womankind\", [79] and that he finds \"the motives of women .. inscrutable. .. How can you build on such quicksand? Their most trivial actions may mean volumes\" [80] In The Sign of Four, he says, \"Women are never to be entirely trusted—not the best of them\", a feeling Watson notes as an \"atrocious sentiment\" [81] In \"The Adventure of the Lion's Mane\", Holmes writes, \"Women have seldom been an attraction to me, for my brain has always governed my heart.\" [82] At the end of The Sign of Four, Holmes states that \"love is an emotional thing, and whatever is emotional is opposed to that true, cold reason which I place above all things I should never marry myself, lest I bias my judgement.\" [83] Ultimately, Holmes claims outright that \"I have never loved.\" [84]\n\n\nIrene Adler\nIrene Adler is a retired American opera singer and actress who appears in \"A Scandal in Bohemia\" Although this is her only appearance, she is one of only a handful of people who bests Holmes in a battle of wits, and the only woman For this reason, Adler is the frequent subject of pastiche writing [89] The beginning of the story describes the high regard in which Holmes holds her:\n\n\nKnowledge and skills\nShortly after meeting Holmes in the first story, A Study in Scarlet (generally assumed to be 1881, though the exact date is not given), Watson assesses the detective's abilities:\n\n\nHolmesian deduction\nHolmes observes the dress and attitude of his clients and suspects, noting skin marks (such as tattoos), contamination (such as ink stains or clay on boots), emotional state, and physical condition in order to deduce their origins and recent history The style and state of wear of a person's clothes and personal items are also commonly relied on; in the stories, Holmes is seen applying his method to items such as walking sticks, [108] pipes, [109] and hats [110] For example, in \"A Scandal in Bohemia\", Holmes infers that Watson had got wet lately and had \"a most clumsy and careless servant girl\" When Watson asks how Holmes knows this, the detective answers:\n\n\nForensic science\nThough Holmes is famed for his reasoning capabilities, his investigative technique relies heavily on the acquisition of hard evidence Many of the techniques he employs in the stories were at the time in their infancy [121] [122]\n\n\nDisguises\nHolmes displays a strong aptitude for acting and disguise In several stories (\"The Sign of Four\", \"The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton\", \"The Man with the Twisted Lip\", \"The Adventure of the Empty House\" and \"A Scandal in Bohemia\"), to gather evidence undercover, he uses disguises so convincing that Watson fails to recognise him In others (\"The Adventure of the Dying Detective\" and \"A Scandal in Bohemia\"), Holmes feigns injury or illness to incriminate the guilty In the latter story, Watson says, \"The stage lost a fine actor .. when  [Holmes] became a specialist in crime.\" [133]\n\n\nAgents\nUntil Watson's arrival at Baker Street, Holmes largely worked alone, only occasionally employing agents from the city's underclass These agents included a variety of informants, such as Langdale Pike, a \"human book of reference upon all matters of social scandal\", [135] and Shinwell Johnson, who acted as Holmes's \"agent in the huge criminal underworld of London\" [136] The best known of Holmes's agents are a group of street children he called \"the Baker Street Irregulars\" [137] [138]\n\n\nCombat\nHolmes and Watson often carry pistols with them to confront criminals—in Watson's case, his old service weapon (probably a Mark III Adams revolver, issued to British troops during the 1870s) [139] Holmes and Watson shoot the eponymous hound in The Hound of the Baskervilles, [140] and in \"The Adventure of the Empty House\", Watson pistol-whips Colonel Sebastian Moran [141] In \"The Problem of Thor Bridge\", Holmes uses Watson's revolver to solve the case through an experiment.\n\n\nPistols\nHolmes and Watson often carry pistols with them to confront criminals—in Watson's case, his old service weapon (probably a Mark III Adams revolver, issued to British troops during the 1870s) [139] Holmes and Watson shoot the eponymous hound in The Hound of the Baskervilles, [140] and in \"The Adventure of the Empty House\", Watson pistol-whips Colonel Sebastian Moran [141] In \"The Problem of Thor Bridge\", Holmes uses Watson's revolver to solve the case through an experiment.\n\n\nOther weapons\nAs a gentleman, Holmes often carries a stick or cane He is described by Watson as an expert at singlestick, [92] and uses his cane twice as a weapon [142] In A Study in Scarlet, Watson describes Holmes as an expert swordsman, [92] and in \"The Gloria Scott\", the detective says he practised fencing while at university [59] In several stories (\"A Case of Identity\", \"The Red-Headed League\", \"The Adventure of the Six Napoleons\"), Holmes wields a riding crop, described in the latter story as his \"favourite weapon\" [143]\n\n\nPersonal combat\nThe detective is described (or demonstrated) as possessing above-average physical strength In \"The Yellow Face\", Holmes's chronicler says, \"Few men were capable of greater muscular effort.\" [144] In \"The Adventure of the Speckled Band\", Dr Roylott demonstrates his strength by bending a fire poker in half Watson describes Holmes as laughing and saying, \"'If he had remained I might have shown him that my grip was not much more feeble than his own.' As he spoke he picked up the steel poker and, with a sudden effort, straightened it out again.\" [145]\n\n\nReception\nThe first two Sherlock Holmes stories, the novels A Study in Scarlet (1887) and The Sign of the Four (1890), were moderately well received, but Holmes first became very popular early in 1891 when the first six short stories featuring the character were published in The Strand Magazine Holmes became widely known in Britain and America [1] The character was so well known that in 1893 when Arthur Conan Doyle killed Holmes in the short story \"The Final Problem\", the strongly negative response from readers was unlike any previous public reaction to a fictional event The Strand reportedly lost more than 20,000 subscribers as a result of Holmes's death [152] Public pressure eventually contributed to Conan Doyle writing another Holmes story in 1901 and resurrecting the character in a story published in 1903 [7] In Japan, Sherlock Holmes (and Alice from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland) became immensely popular in the country in the 1890s as it was opening up to the West, and they are cited as two British fictional Victorians who left an enormous creative and cultural legacy there [153]\n\n\nPopularity\nThe first two Sherlock Holmes stories, the novels A Study in Scarlet (1887) and The Sign of the Four (1890), were moderately well received, but Holmes first became

of its twenty electric locomotives deployed in the 1920s for Sherlock Holmes He was the only fictional character so honoured, along with eminent Britons such as Lord Byron, Benjamin Disraeli, and Florence Nightingale [157]\n\n\nSocieties\nIn 1934, the Sherlock Holmes Society (in London) and the Baker Street Irregulars (in New York) were founded The latter is still active The Sherlock Holmes Society was dissolved later in the 1930s, but was succeeded by a society with a slightly different name, the Sherlock Holmes Society of London, which was founded in 1951 and remains active [169] [170] These societies were followed by many more, first in the U.S (where they are known as \"scion societies\"—offshoots—of the Baker Street Irregulars) and then in England and Denmark There are at least 250 societies worldwide, including Australia, Canada (such as The Bootmakers of Toronto), India, and Japan [171] Fans tend to be called \"Holmesians\" in the U.K and \"Sherlockians\" in the U.S., [172] [173] [174] though recently \"Sherlockian\" has also come to refer to fans of the Benedict Cumberbatch-led BBC series regardless of location [175]\n\n\nLegacy\nAlthough Holmes is not the original fictional detective, his name has become synonymous with the role Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories introduced multiple literary devices that have become major conventions in detective fiction, such as the companion character who is not as clever as the detective and has solutions explained to him (thus informing the reader as well), as with Dr Watson in the Holmes stories Other conventions introduced by Doyle include the arch-criminal who is too clever for the official police to defeat, like Holmes's adversary Professor Moriarty, and the use of forensic science to solve cases [1]\n\n\nThe detective story\nAlthough Holmes is not the original fictional detective, his name has become synonymous with the role Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories introduced multiple literary devices

as with Dr Watson in the Holmes stories Other conventions introduced by Doyle include the arch-criminal who is too clever for the official police to defeat, like Holmes's adversary Professor Moriarty, and the use of forensic science to solve cases [1]\n\n\n\"Elementary, my dear Watson\"\nThe phrase \"Elementary, my dear Watson\" has become one of the most quoted and iconic aspects of the character However, although Holmes often observes that his conclusions are \"elementary\", and occasionally calls Watson \"my dear Watson\", the phrase \"Elementary, my dear Watson\" is never uttered in any of the sixty stories by Conan Doyle [178] One of the nearest approximations of the phrase appears in \"The Adventure of the Crooked Man\" (1893) when Holmes explains a deduction: \"'Excellent!' I cried 'Elementary,' said he.\" [179] [180]\n\n\nThe Great Game\nConan Doyle's 56 short stories and four novels are known as the \"canon\" by Holmes aficionados The Great Game (also known as the Holmesian Game, the Sherlockian Game, or simply the Game, also the Higher Criticism) applies the methods of literary and especially Biblical criticism to the canon, operating on the pretense that Holmes and Watson were real people and that Conan Doyle was not the author of the stories but Watson's literary agent From this basis, it attempts to resolve or explain away contradictions in the canon—such as the location of Watson's war wound, described as being in his shoulder in A Study in Scarlet and in his leg in The Sign of Four—and clarify details about Holmes, Watson and their world, such as the exact dates of events in the stories, combining historical research with references from the stories to construct scholarly analyses [185] [186] [187]\n\n\nMuseums and special collections\nFor the 1951 Festival of Britain, Holmes's living room was reconstructed as part of a Sherlock Holmes exhibition, with a collection of original material After the festival, items were transferred to The Sherlock Holmes (a London pub) and the Conan Doyle collection housed in Lucens, Switzerland, by the author's son, Adrian Both exhibitions, each with a Baker Street sitting-room reconstruction, are open to the public [192]\n\n\nPostcolonial criticism\nThe Sherlock Holmes stories have been scrutinized by a few academics for themes of empire and colonialism.\n\n\nAdaptations and derived works\nThe popularity of Sherlock Holmes has meant that many writers other than Arthur Conan Doyle have created tales of the detective in a wide variety of different media, with varying degrees of fidelity to the original characters, stories, and setting The first known period pastiche dates from 1891 Titled \"The Late Sherlock Holmes\", it was written by Conan Doyle's close friend J M Barrie [200]\n\n\nRelated and derivative writings\nIn addition to the Holmes canon, Conan Doyle's 1898 \"The Lost Special\" features an unnamed \"amateur reasoner\" intended to be identified as Holmes by his readers The author's explanation of a baffling disappearance argued in Holmesian style poked fun at his own creation Similar Conan Doyle short stories are \"The Field Bazaar\", \"The Man with the Watches\", and 1924's \"How Watson Learned the Trick\", a parody of the Watson–Holmes breakfast-table scenes The author wrote other material featuring Holmes, especially plays: 1899's Sherlock Holmes (with William Gillette), 1910's The Speckled Band, and 1921's The Crown Diamond (the basis for \"The Adventure of the Mazarin Stone\") [206] These non-canonical works have been collected in several works released since Conan Doyle's death [207]\n\n\nAdaptations in other media\nIn 2012, Guinness World Records listed Holmes as the most portrayed literary human character in film and television history, with more than 75 actors playing the part in over 250 productions [3]\n\n\nCopyright issues\nThe copyright for Conan Doyle's works expired in the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia at the end of 1980, fifty years after Conan Doyle's death [256] [257] In the United Kingdom, it was revived in 1996 due to new provisions harmonising UK law with that of the European Union, and expired again at the end of 2000 (seventy years after Conan Doyle's death) [258] The author's works are now in the public domain in those countries [259] [260]\n\n\nWorks\nThe short stories, originally published in magazines, were later collected in five anthologies:\n\n\nNovels\nThe short stories, originally published in magazines, were later collected in five anthologies:\n\n\nShort story collections\nThe short stories, originally published in magazines, were later collected in five anthologies:\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nSherlock Holmes story references\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Sherlock Holmes is a fictional character created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. He is a consulting detective who uses his powers of observation, deduction, and analytical thinking to solve complex cases. Holmes is considered one of the most iconic and influential characters in detective fiction, and his stories have been widely popularized through various adaptations and interpretations.\n\n**Inspiration for the character**\n\nEdgar Allan Poe's C. Auguste Dupin is generally acknowledged as the first detective in fiction and served as the prototype for many later characters, including Holmes. Conan Doyle once wrote, \"Each of Poe's detective stories is a root from which a whole literature has developed... Where was the detective story until Poe breathed the breath of life into it?\" Similarly, the stories of Émile Gaboriau's Monsieur Lecoq were extremely popular at the time Conan Doyle began writing Holmes, and Holmes's speech and behavior sometimes follow those of Lecoq. Doyle has his main characters discuss these literary antecedents near the beginning of A Study in Scarlet, which is set soon after Watson is first introduced to Holmes. Watson attempts to compliment Holmes by comparing him to Dupin, to which Holmes replies that he found Dupin to be \"a very inferior fellow\" and Lecoq to be \"a miserable bungler\".\n\n**Biography**\n\nDetails of Sherlock Holmes' life in Conan Doyle's stories are scarce and often vague. Nevertheless, mentions of his early life and extended family paint a loose biographical picture of the detective.\n\n**Family and early life**\n\nDetails of Sherlock Holmes' life in Conan Doyle's stories are scarce and often vague. Nevertheless, mentions of his early life and extended family paint a loose biographical picture of the detective. Holmes' parents are Mycroft and Mary Morstan Holmes, and his younger brother is Mycroft Holmes, a government official. His family is mentioned in several stories, including \"The Adventure of the Empty House\" and \"The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans\".\n\n**Life with Watson**\n\nIn the first Holmes tale, A Study in Scarlet, financial difficulties lead Holmes and Dr. Watson to share rooms together at 221B Baker Street, London. Their residence is maintained by their landlady, Mrs. Hudson. Holmes works as a detective for twenty-three years, with Watson assisting him for seventeen of those years. Most of the stories are frame narratives written from Watson's point of view, as summaries of the detective's most interesting cases. Holmes frequently calls Watson's records of Holmes's cases sensational and populist, suggesting that they fail to accurately and objectively report the \"science\" of his craft.\n\n**Practice**\n\nHolmes' clients vary from the most powerful monarchs and governments of Europe, to wealthy aristocrats and industrialists, to impoverished pawnbrokers and governesses. He is known only in select professional circles at the beginning of the first story, but is already collaborating with Scotland Yard. However, his continued work and the publication of Watson's stories raise Holmes's profile, and he rapidly becomes well known as a detective; so many clients ask for his help instead of (or in addition to) that of the police that, Watson writes, by 1887 \"Europe was ringing with his name\" and by 1895 Holmes has \"an immense practice\". Police outside London ask Holmes for assistance if he is nearby. A British prime minister and the King of Bohemia visit 221B Baker Street in person to request Holmes's assistance; the President of France awards him the Legion of Honour for capturing an assassin; the King of Scandinavia is a client; and he aids the Vatican at least twice. The detective acts on behalf of the British government in matters of national security several times and declines a knighthood \"for services which may perhaps some day be described\". However, he does not actively seek fame and is usually content to let the police take public credit for his work.\n\n**The Great Hiatus**\n\nThe first set of Holmes stories was published between 1887 and 1893. Conan Doyle killed off Holmes in a final battle with the criminal mastermind Professor James Moriarty in \"The Final Problem\" (published 1893, but set in 1891), as Conan Doyle felt that \"my literary energies should not be directed too much into one channel\". However, the reaction of the public surprised him very much. Distressed readers wrote anguished letters to The Strand Magazine, which suffered a terrible blow when 20,000 people cancelled their subscriptions to the magazine in protest. Conan Doyle himself received many protest letters, and one lady even began her letter with \"You brute\". Legend has it that Londoners were so distraught upon hearing the news of Holmes's death that they wore black armbands in mourning, though there is no known contemporaneous source for this; the earliest known reference to such events comes from 1949. However, the recorded public reaction to Holmes's death was unlike anything previously seen for fictional events.\n\n**Retirement**\n\nIn His Last Bow, the reader is told that Holmes has retired to a small farm on the Sussex Downs and taken up beekeeping as his primary occupation. The move is not dated precisely, but can be presumed to be no later than 1904 (since it is referred to retrospectively in \"The Adventure of the Second Stain\", first published that year). The story features Holmes and Watson coming out of retirement to aid the British war effort. Only one other adventure, \"The Adventure of the Lion's Mane\", takes place during the detective's retirement.\n\n**Personality and habits**\n\nWatson describes Holmes as \"bohemian\" in his habits and lifestyle. Said to have a \"cat-like\" love of personal cleanliness, at the same time Holmes is an eccentric with no regard for contemporary standards of tidiness or good order. Watson describes him as having a \"cat-like\" love of personal cleanliness and a disregard for contemporary standards of tidiness or good order.\n\n**Drug use**\n\nHolmes occasionally uses addictive drugs, especially in the absence of stimulating cases. He sometimes used morphine and sometimes cocaine, the latter of which he injects in a seven-per cent solution; both drugs were legal in 19th-century England. As a physician, Watson strongly disapproves of his friend's cocaine habit, describing it as the detective's only vice, and concerned about its effect on Holmes's mental health and intellect. In \"The Adventure of the Missing Three-Quarter\", Watson says that although he has \"weaned\" Holmes from drugs, the detective remains an addict whose habit is \"not dead, but merely sleeping\".\n\n**Finances**\n\nHolmes is known to charge clients for his expenses and claim any reward offered for a problem's solution, such as in \"The Adventure of the Speckled Band\", \"The Red-Headed League\", and \"The Adventure of the Beryl Coronet\". The detective states at one point that \"My professional charges are upon a fixed scale I do not vary them, save when I remit them altogether.\" In this context, a client is offering to double his fee, and it is implied that wealthy clients habitually pay Holmes more than his standard rate. In \"The Adventure of the Priory School\", Holmes earns a £6,000 fee (at a time where annual expenses for a rising young professional were in the area of £500). However, Watson notes that Holmes would refuse to help even the wealthy and powerful if their cases did not interest him.\n\n**Attitudes towards women**\n\nAs Conan Doyle wrote to Joseph Bell, \"Holmes is as inhuman as a Babbage's Calculating Machine and just about as likely to fall in love.\" Holmes says of himself that he is \"not a whole-souled admirer of womankind\", and that he finds \"the motives of women... inscrutable... How can you build on such quicksand? Their most trivial actions may mean volumes\". In The Sign of Four, he says, \"Women are never to be entirely trusted—not the best of them\", a feeling Watson notes as an \"atrocious sentiment\". In \"The Adventure of the Lion's Mane\", Holmes writes, \"Women have seldom been an attraction to me, for my brain has always governed my heart.\" At the end of The Sign of Four, Holmes states that \"love is an emotional thing, and whatever is emotional is opposed to that true, cold reason which I place above all things I should never marry myself, lest I bias my judgement.\" Ultimately, Holmes claims outright that \"I have never loved\".\n\n**Knowledge and skills**\n\nHolmes observes the dress and attitude of his clients and suspects, noting skin marks (such as tattoos), contamination (such as ink stains or clay on boots), emotional state, and physical condition in order to deduce their origins and recent history. The style and state of wear of a person's clothes and personal items are also commonly relied on; in the stories, Holmes is seen applying his method to items such as walking sticks, pipes, and hats. For example, in \"A Scandal in Bohemia\", Holmes infers that Watson had got wet lately and had \"a most clumsy and careless servant girl\". When Watson asks how Holmes knows this, the detective answers that he noticed the \"damp and muddy\" state of Watson's boots and the \"general air of dishevelment\" in his clothes.\n\n**Forensic science**\n\nThough Holmes is famed for his reasoning capabilities, his investigative technique relies heavily on the acquisition of hard evidence. Many of the techniques he employs in the stories were at the time in their infancy.\n\n**Disguises**\n\nHolmes displays a strong aptitude for acting and disguise. In several stories (\"The Sign of Four\", \"The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton\", \"The Man with the Twisted Lip\", \"The Adventure of the Empty House\" and \"A Scandal in Bohemia\"), to gather evidence undercover, he uses disguises so convincing that Watson fails to recognise him. In others (\"The Adventure of the Dying Detective\" and \"A Scandal in Bohemia\"), Holmes feigns injury or illness to incriminate the guilty. In the latter story, Watson says, \"The stage lost a fine actor... when [Holmes] became a specialist in crime.\"\n\n**Agents**\n\nUntil Watson's arrival at Baker Street, Holmes largely worked alone, only occasionally employing agents from the city's underclass. These agents included a variety of informants, such as Langdale Pike, a \"human book of reference upon all matters of social scandal\", and Shinwell Johnson, who acted as Holmes's \"agent in the huge criminal underworld of London\". The best known of Holmes's agents are a group of street children he called \"the Baker Street Irregulars\".\n\n**Combat**\n\nHolmes and Watson often carry pistols with them to confront criminals—in Watson's case, his old service weapon (probably a Mark III Adams revolver, issued to British troops during the 1870s). Holmes and Watson shoot the eponymous hound in The Hound of the Baskervilles, and in \"The Adventure of the Empty House\", Watson pistol-whips Colonel Sebastian Moran. In \"The Problem of Thor Bridge\", Holmes uses Watson's revolver to solve the case through an experiment.\n\n**Personal combat**\n\nThe detective is described (or demonstrated) as possessing above-average physical strength. In \"The Yellow Face\", Holmes's chronicler says, \"Few men were capable of greater muscular effort.\" In \"The Adventure of the Speckled Band\", Dr. Roylott demonstrates his strength by bending a fire poker in half. Watson describes Holmes as laughing and saying, \"'If he had remained I might have shown him that my grip was not much more feeble than his own.' As he spoke he picked up the steel poker and, with a sudden effort, straightened it out again.\"\n\n**Legacy**\n\nThe popularity of Sherlock Holmes has meant that many writers other than Arthur Conan Doyle have created tales of the detective in a wide variety of different media, with varying degrees of fidelity to the original characters, stories, and setting. The first known period pastiche dates from 1891, titled \"The Late Sherlock Holmes\", written by Conan Doyle's close friend J.M. Barrie. In addition to the Holmes canon, Conan Doyle's 1898 \"The Lost Special\" features an unnamed \"amateur reasoner\" intended to be identified as Holmes by his readers. The author's explanation of a baffling disappearance argued in Holmesian style poked fun at his own creation.\n\n**Adaptations and derived works**\n\nIn addition to the Holmes canon, Conan Doyle's 1898 \"The Lost Special\" features an unnamed \"amateur reasoner\" intended to be identified as Holmes by his readers. The author's explanation of a baffling disappearance argued in Holmesian style poked fun at his own creation. In addition to the Holmes canon, Conan Doyle's 1898 \"The Lost Special\" features an unnamed \"amateur reasoner\" intended to be identified as Holmes by his readers. The author's explanation of a baffling disappearance argued in Holmesian style poked fun at his own creation. Similar Conan Doyle short stories are \"The Field Bazaar\", \"The Man with the Watches\", and 1924's \"How Watson Learned the Trick\", a parody of the Watson–Holmes breakfast-table scenes.\n\n**Adaptations in other media**\n\nIn 2012, Guinness World Records listed Holmes as the most portrayed literary human character in film and television history, with more than 75 actors playing the part in over 250 productions.\n\n**Copyright issues**\n\nThe copyright for Conan Doyle's works expired in the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia at the end of 1980, fifty years after Conan Doyle's death. In the United Kingdom, it was revived in 1996 due to new provisions harmonising UK law with that of the European Union, and expired again at the end of 2000 (seventy years after Conan Doyle's death). The author's works are now in the public domain in those countries.\n\n**Works**\n\nThe short stories, originally published in magazines, were later collected in five anthologies:\n\n* The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (1905)\n* His Last Bow: Some Later Reminiscences of Sherlock Holmes (1917)\n* The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes (1927)\n* The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes (1894)\n* The Return of Sherlock Holmes (1905)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Sherlock_Holmes\" following this outline:\n\n\nInspiration for the character\nEdgar Allan Poe's C Auguste Dupin is generally acknowledged as the first detective in fiction and served as the prototype for many later characters, including Holmes [8] Conan Doyle once wrote, \"Each  [of Poe's detective stories] is a root from which a whole literature has developed ..

the earliest known reference to such events comes from 1949 [46] However, the recorded public reaction to Holmes's death was unlike anything previously seen for fictional events [7]\n\n\nRetirement\nIn His Last Bow, the reader is told that Holmes has retired to a small farm on the Sussex Downs and taken up beekeeping as his primary occupation [50] The move is not dated precisely, but can be presumed to be no later than 1904 (since it is referred to retrospectively in \"The Adventure of the Second Stain\", first published that year) [51] The story features Holmes and Watson coming out of retirement to aid the British war effort Only one other adventure, \"The Adventure of the Lion's Mane\", takes place during the detective's retirement [52]\n\n\nPersonality and habits\nWatson describes Holmes as \"bohemian\" in his habits and lifestyle [53] Said to have a \"cat-like\" love of personal cleanliness, [54] at the same time Holmes is an eccentric with no regard for contemporary standards of tidiness or good order Watson describes him as\n\n\nDrug use\nHolmes occasionally uses addictive drugs, especially in the absence of stimulating cases [65] He sometimes used morphine and sometimes cocaine, the latter of which he injects in a seven-per cent solution; both drugs were legal in 19th-century England [66] [67] [68] As a physician, Watson strongly disapproves of his friend's cocaine habit, describing it as the detective's only vice, and concerned about its effect on Holmes's mental health and intellect [69] [70] In \"The Adventure of the Missing Three-Quarter\", Watson says that although he has \"weaned\" Holmes from drugs, the detective remains an addict whose habit is \"not dead, but merely sleeping\" [71]\n\n\nFinances\nHolmes is known to charge clients for his expenses and claim any reward offered for a problem's solution, such as in \"The Adventure of the Speckled Band\", \"The Red-Headed League\", and \"The Adventure of the Beryl Coronet\" The detective states at one point that \"My professional charges are upon a fixed scale I do not vary them, save when I remit them altogether.\" In this context, a client is offering to double his fee, and it is implied that wealthy clients habitually pay Holmes more than his standard rate [74] In \"The Adventure of the Priory School\", Holmes earns a £6,000 fee [75] (at a time where annual expenses for a rising young professional were in the area of £500) [76] However, Watson notes that Holmes would refuse to help even the wealthy and powerful if their cases did not interest him [77]\n\n\nAttitudes towards women\nAs Conan Doyle wrote to Joseph Bell, \"Holmes is as inhuman as a Babbage's Calculating Machine and just about as likely to fall in love.\" [78] Holmes says of himself that he is \"not a whole-souled admirer of womankind\", [79] and that he finds \"the motives of women .. inscrutable. .. How can you build on such quicksand? Their most trivial actions may mean volumes\" [80] In The Sign of Four, he says, \"Women are never to be entirely trusted—not the best of them\", a feeling Watson notes as an \"atrocious sentiment\" [81] In \"The Adventure of the Lion's Mane\", Holmes writes, \"Women have seldom been an attraction to me, for my brain has always governed my heart.\" [82] At the end of The Sign of Four, Holmes states that \"love is an emotional thing, and whatever is emotional is opposed to that true, cold reason which I place above all things I should never marry myself, lest I bias my judgement.\" [83] Ultimately, Holmes claims outright that \"I have never loved.\" [84]\n\n\nIrene Adler\nIrene Adler is a retired American opera singer and actress who appears in \"A Scandal in Bohemia\" Although this is her only appearance, she is one of only a handful of people who bests Holmes in a battle of wits, and the only woman For this reason, Adler is the frequent subject of pastiche writing [89] The beginning of the story describes the high regard in which Holmes holds her:\n\n\nKnowledge and skills\nShortly after meeting Holmes in the first story, A Study in Scarlet (generally assumed to be 1881, though the exact date is not given), Watson assesses the detective's abilities:\n\n\nHolmesian deduction\nHolmes observes the dress and attitude of his clients and suspects, noting skin marks (such as tattoos), contamination (such as ink stains or clay on boots), emotional state, and physical condition in order to deduce their origins and recent history The style and state of wear of a person's clothes and personal items are also commonly relied on; in the stories, Holmes is seen applying his method to items such as walking sticks, [108] pipes, [109] and hats [110] For example, in \"A Scandal in Bohemia\", Holmes infers that Watson had got wet lately and had \"a most clumsy and careless servant girl\" When Watson asks how Holmes knows this, the detective answers:\n\n\nForensic science\nThough Holmes is famed for his reasoning capabilities, his investigative technique relies heavily on the acquisition of hard evidence Many of the techniques he employs in the stories were at the time in their infancy [121] [122]\n\n\nDisguises\nHolmes displays a strong aptitude for acting and disguise In several stories (\"The Sign of Four\", \"The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton\", \"The Man with the Twisted Lip\", \"The Adventure of the Empty House\" and \"A Scandal in Bohemia\"), to gather evidence undercover, he uses disguises so convincing that Watson fails to recognise him In others (\"The Adventure of the Dying Detective\" and \"A Scandal in Bohemia\"), Holmes feigns injury or illness to incriminate the guilty In the latter story, Watson says, \"The stage lost a fine actor .. when  [Holmes] became a specialist in crime.\" [133]\n\n\nAgents\nUntil Watson's arrival at Baker Street, Holmes largely worked alone, only occasionally employing agents from the city's underclass These agents included a variety of informants, such as Langdale Pike, a \"human book of reference upon all matters of social scandal\", [135] and Shinwell Johnson, who acted as Holmes's \"agent in the huge criminal underworld of London\" [136] The best known of Holmes's agents are a group of street children he called \"the Baker Street Irregulars\" [137] [138]\n\n\nCombat\nHolmes and Watson often carry pistols with them to confront criminals—in Watson's case, his old service weapon (probably a Mark III Adams revolver, issued to British troops during the 1870s) [139] Holmes and Watson shoot the eponymous hound in The Hound of the Baskervilles, [140] and in \"The Adventure of the Empty House\", Watson pistol-whips Colonel Sebastian Moran [141] In \"The Problem of Thor Bridge\", Holmes uses Watson's revolver to solve the case through an experiment.\n\n\nPistols\nHolmes and Watson often carry pistols with them to confront criminals—in Watson's case, his old service weapon (probably a Mark III Adams revolver, issued to British troops during the 1870s) [139] Holmes and Watson shoot the eponymous hound in The Hound of the Baskervilles, [140] and in \"The Adventure of the Empty House\", Watson pistol-whips Colonel Sebastian Moran [141] In \"The Problem of Thor Bridge\", Holmes uses Watson's revolver to solve the case through an experiment.\n\n\nOther weapons\nAs a gentleman, Holmes often carries a stick or cane He is described by Watson as an expert at singlestick, [92] and uses his cane twice as a weapon [142] In A Study in Scarlet, Watson describes Holmes as an expert swordsman, [92] and in \"The Gloria Scott\", the detective says he practised fencing while at university [59] In several stories (\"A Case of Identity\", \"The Red-Headed League\", \"The Adventure of the Six Napoleons\"), Holmes wields a riding crop, described in the latter story as his \"favourite weapon\" [143]\n\n\nPersonal combat\nThe detective is described (or demonstrated) as possessing above-average physical strength In \"The Yellow Face\", Holmes's chronicler says, \"Few men were capable of greater muscular effort.\" [144] In \"The Adventure of the Speckled Band\", Dr Roylott demonstrates his strength by bending a fire poker in half Watson describes Holmes as laughing and saying, \"'If he had remained I might have shown him that my grip was not much more feeble than his own.' As he spoke he picked up the steel poker and, with a sudden effort, straightened it out again.\" [145]\n\n\nReception\nThe first two Sherlock Holmes stories, the novels A Study in Scarlet (1887) and The Sign of the Four (1890), were moderately well received, but Holmes first became very popular early in 1891 when the first six short stories featuring the character were published in The Strand Magazine Holmes became widely known in Britain and America [1] The character was so well known that in 1893 when Arthur Conan Doyle killed Holmes in the short story \"The Final Problem\", the strongly negative response from readers was unlike any previous public reaction to a fictional event The Strand reportedly lost more than 20,000 subscribers as a result of Holmes's death [152] Public pressure eventually contributed to Conan Doyle writing another Holmes story in 1901 and resurrecting the character in a story published in 1903 [7] In Japan, Sherlock Holmes (and Alice from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland) became immensely popular in the country in the 1890s as it was opening up to the West, and they are cited as two British fictional Victorians who left an enormous creative and cultural legacy there [153]\n\n\nPopularity\nThe first two Sherlock Holmes stories, the novels A Study in Scarlet (1887) and The Sign of the Four (1890), were moderately well received, but Holmes first became

of its twenty electric locomotives deployed in the 1920s for Sherlock Holmes He was the only fictional character so honoured, along with eminent Britons such as Lord Byron, Benjamin Disraeli, and Florence Nightingale [157]\n\n\nSocieties\nIn 1934, the Sherlock Holmes Society (in London) and the Baker Street Irregulars (in New York) were founded The latter is still active The Sherlock Holmes Society was dissolved later in the 1930s, but was succeeded by a society with a slightly different name, the Sherlock Holmes Society of London, which was founded in 1951 and remains active [169] [170] These societies were followed by many more, first in the U.S (where they are known as \"scion societies\"—offshoots—of the Baker Street Irregulars) and then in England and Denmark There are at least 250 societies worldwide, including Australia, Canada (such as The Bootmakers of Toronto), India, and Japan [171] Fans tend to be called \"Holmesians\" in the U.K and \"Sherlockians\" in the U.S., [172] [173] [174] though recently \"Sherlockian\" has also come to refer to fans of the Benedict Cumberbatch-led BBC series regardless of location [175]\n\n\nLegacy\nAlthough Holmes is not the original fictional detective, his name has become synonymous with the role Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories introduced multiple literary devices that have become major conventions in detective fiction, such as the companion character who is not as clever as the detective and has solutions explained to him (thus informing the reader as well), as with Dr Watson in the Holmes stories Other conventions introduced by Doyle include the arch-criminal who is too clever for the official police to defeat, like Holmes's adversary Professor Moriarty, and the use of forensic science to solve cases [1]\n\n\nThe detective story\nAlthough Holmes is not the original fictional detective, his name has become synonymous with the role Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories introduced multiple literary devices

as with Dr Watson in the Holmes stories Other conventions introduced by Doyle include the arch-criminal who is too clever for the official police to defeat, like Holmes's adversary Professor Moriarty, and the use of forensic science to solve cases [1]\n\n\n\"Elementary, my dear Watson\"\nThe phrase \"Elementary, my dear Watson\" has become one of the most quoted and iconic aspects of the character However, although Holmes often observes that his conclusions are \"elementary\", and occasionally calls Watson \"my dear Watson\", the phrase \"Elementary, my dear Watson\" is never uttered in any of the sixty stories by Conan Doyle [178] One of the nearest approximations of the phrase appears in \"The Adventure of the Crooked Man\" (1893) when Holmes explains a deduction: \"'Excellent!' I cried 'Elementary,' said he.\" [179] [180]\n\n\nThe Great Game\nConan Doyle's 56 short stories and four novels are known as the \"canon\" by Holmes aficionados The Great Game (also known as the Holmesian Game, the Sherlockian Game, or simply the Game, also the Higher Criticism) applies the methods of literary and especially Biblical criticism to the canon, operating on the pretense that Holmes and Watson were real people and that Conan Doyle was not the author of the stories but Watson's literary agent From this basis, it attempts to resolve or explain away contradictions in the canon—such as the location of Watson's war wound, described as being in his shoulder in A Study in Scarlet and in his leg in The Sign of Four—and clarify details about Holmes, Watson and their world, such as the exact dates of events in the stories, combining historical research with references from the stories to construct scholarly analyses [185] [186] [187]\n\n\nMuseums and special collections\nFor the 1951 Festival of Britain, Holmes's living room was reconstructed as part of a Sherlock Holmes exhibition, with a collection of original material After the festival, items were transferred to The Sherlock Holmes (a London pub) and the Conan Doyle collection housed in Lucens, Switzerland, by the author's son, Adrian Both exhibitions, each with a Baker Street sitting-room reconstruction, are open to the public [192]\n\n\nPostcolonial criticism\nThe Sherlock Holmes stories have been scrutinized by a few academics for themes of empire and colonialism.\n\n\nAdaptations and derived works\nThe popularity of Sherlock Holmes has meant that many writers other than Arthur Conan Doyle have created tales of the detective in a wide variety of different media, with varying degrees of fidelity to the original characters, stories, and setting The first known period pastiche dates from 1891 Titled \"The Late Sherlock Holmes\", it was written by Conan Doyle's close friend J M Barrie [200]\n\n\nRelated and derivative writings\nIn addition to the Holmes canon, Conan Doyle's 1898 \"The Lost Special\" features an unnamed \"amateur reasoner\" intended to be identified as Holmes by his readers The author's explanation of a baffling disappearance argued in Holmesian style poked fun at his own creation Similar Conan Doyle short stories are \"The Field Bazaar\", \"The Man with the Watches\", and 1924's \"How Watson Learned the Trick\", a parody of the Watson–Holmes breakfast-table scenes The author wrote other material featuring Holmes, especially plays: 1899's Sherlock Holmes (with William Gillette), 1910's The Speckled Band, and 1921's The Crown Diamond (the basis for \"The Adventure of the Mazarin Stone\") [206] These non-canonical works have been collected in several works released since Conan Doyle's death [207]\n\n\nAdaptations in other media\nIn 2012, Guinness World Records listed Holmes as the most portrayed literary human character in film and television history, with more than 75 actors playing the part in over 250 productions [3]\n\n\nCopyright issues\nThe copyright for Conan Doyle's works expired in the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia at the end of 1980, fifty years after Conan Doyle's death [256] [257] In the United Kingdom, it was revived in 1996 due to new provisions harmonising UK law with that of the European Union, and expired again at the end of 2000 (seventy years after Conan Doyle's death) [258] The author's works are now in the public domain in those countries [259] [260]\n\n\nWorks\nThe short stories, originally published in magazines, were later collected in five anthologies:\n\n\nNovels\nThe short stories, originally published in magazines, were later collected in five anthologies:\n\n\nShort story collections\nThe short stories, originally published in magazines, were later collected in five anthologies:\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nSherlock Holmes story references\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Greenstone Belt in the Western Ghats (an area composed of metavolcanics, iron formations and ferruginous quartzite), yields evidence for Acheulean occupation [19] Rock art engravings (petroglyphs) are present on laterite platforms and granite boulders in Usgalimal near the west flowing Kushavati river and in Kajur [20] In Kajur, the rock engravings of animals, tectiforms and other designs in granite have been associated with what is considered to be a megalithic stone circle with a round granite stone in the centre [21] Petroglyphs, cones, stone-axe, and choppers dating to 10,000 years ago have been found in various locations in Goa, including Kazur, Mauxim, and the Mandovi-Zuari basin [22] Recently these petroglyphs have been included in the tentative list of UNESCO world heritage

century BC, Goa was part of the Maurya Empire, ruled by the Buddhist emperor, Ashoka of Magadha Buddhist monks laid the foundation of Buddhism in Goa Between the 2nd century BC and the 6th century AD, Goa was ruled by the Bhojas of Goa Chutus of Karwar also ruled some parts as feudatories of the Satavahanas of Kolhapur (2nd century BC to the 2nd century AD), Western Kshatrapas (around 150 AD), the Abhiras of Western Maharashtra, Bhojas of Goa, and the Konkan Mauryas as feudatories of the Kalachuris [25] The rule later passed to the Chalukyas of Badami, who controlled it between 578 and 753, and later the Rashtrakutas of Malkhed from 753 to 963 From 765 to 1015, the Southern Silharas of Konkan ruled Goa as the feudatories of the Chalukyas and the Rashtrakutas [26] Over the next few centuries, Goa was successively ruled by the Kadambas as the feudatories of the Chalukyas of Kalyani They patronised Jainism in Goa [27]\n\n\nPortuguese period\nIn 1510, the Portuguese defeated the ruling Bijapur sultan Yusuf Adil Shah with the help of a local ally, Thimmayya [29] or Timoji, a privateer [30] They set up a permanent settlement in Velha Goa (Old Goa) This was the beginning of Portuguese colonial rule in Goa that would last for four and a half centuries, until its annexation by India in 1961 The Goa Inquisition, a formal tribunal, was established in 1560, and was finally abolished in 1812 [31]\n\n\nContemporary period\nAfter India gained independence from British rule in 1947, India requested that Portuguese territories on the Indian subcontinent be ceded to India Portugal refused to negotiate on the sovereignty of its Indian enclaves On 19 December 1961, the Indian Army invaded with Operation Vijay resulting in the annexation of Goa, and of Daman and Diu islands into the Indian union Goa, Daman and Diu, were organised as a single centrally administered union territory of India [34] On 16 January 1967 a referendum was held in Goa, to decide the future of the Union Territory of Goa, Daman and Diu It was the only referendum to have been held in independent India The referendum offered the people of Goa a choice between continuing as a union territory or merging with the state of Maharashtra and the majority chose the former [35] [36] [37] On 30 May 1987, the union territory was split, and Goa was made India's twenty-fifth state, with Daman and Diu remaining a union territory [38]\n\n\nGeography\nGoa encompasses an area of 3,702 km2 (1,429 sq mi) It lies between the latitudes 14°53′54″ N and 15°40′00″ N and longitudes 73°40′33″ E and 74°20′13″ E [citation needed]\n\n\nClimate\nGoa features a tropical monsoon climate under the Köppen climate classification Goa, being in the torrid zone and near the Arabian Sea, has a hot and humid climate for most of the year The month of May is usually the hottest, seeing daytime temperatures of over 35 °C (95 °F) coupled with high humidity The state's three seasons are southwest monsoon period (June–September), post-monsoon period (October–January), and pre-monsoon period (February–May) [39] Over 90% of the average annual rainfall (3,048 mm or 120 in) is received during the monsoon season [39]\n\n\nSubdivisions\nThe state is divided into two civil districts—North Goa and South Goa Each district is administered by a District Collector, appointed by the Government of India [citation needed]\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nThe politics of Goa are a result of the uniqueness of this region due to 450 years of Portuguese rule, in comparison to three centuries of British rule experienced by most of the rest of India The Indian National Congress was unable to achieve electoral success in the first two decades after the State's incorporation into India [43] Instead, the state was dominated by the regional political parties like Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party and the United Goans Party [44]\n\n\nGovernment\nGoa has two members of parliament (MP) elected from each district representing the state in the Lok Sabha (House of the People), the lower house of the national Parliament of India It is also has one member of parliament in the Rajya Sabha (Council of the States), the upper house of the Indian parliament [citation needed]\n\n\nFlora and fauna\nEquatorial forest cover in Goa stands at 1,500 km2 (579 sq mi), [16] most of which is owned by the government Government-owned forest is estimated at 1,300 km2 (502 sq mi) while private is given as 200 km2 (77 sq mi) Most of the forests in the state are located in the interior eastern regions of the state The Western Ghats, which form most of eastern Goa, have been internationally recognised as one of the biodiversity hotspots of the world In the February 1999 issue of National Geographic Magazine, Goa was compared with the Amazon and the Congo basins for its rich tropical biodiversity [51]\n\n\nEconomy\nGoa's state domestic product for 2017 is estimated at $11 billion at current prices Goa is India's richest state with the highest GDP per capita—two and a half times that of the country—with one of its fastest growth rates: 8.23% (yearly average 1990–2000) [55] Tourism is Goa's primary industry: it gets 12% [56] of foreign tourist arrivals in India Goa has two main tourist seasons: winter and summer In winter, tourists from abroad (mainly Europe) come, and summer (which, in Goa, is the rainy season) sees tourists from across India Goa's net state domestic product (NSDP) was around US$7.24 billion in 2015–16 [57]\n\n\nDemographics\nA native of Goa is called a Goan Goa has a population of 1.459 million residents as of 2011, [62] making it the fourth least populated state of India after Sikkim, Mizoram, and Arunachal Pradesh Population density of Goa is 394 per km2 which is higher than national average 382 per km2 Goa is the state with highest proportion of urban population with 62.17% of the population living in urban areas The sex ratio is 973 females to 1,000 males The birth rate was 15.70 per 1,000 people in 2007 Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes make up 1.74% and 10.23% of the population respectively As of the 2011 census, over 76% of the population was born in Goa, while just over half of migrants to the state are from the neighbouring states of Karnataka and Maharashtra [63] As per a 2021 report, over 50% of the permanent resident population is of non-Goan origin, outnumbering the native ethnic Goan population [64]\n\n\nPopulation\nA native of Goa is called a Goan Goa has a population of 1.459 million residents as of 2011, [62] making it the fourth

inland In 2010, there were more than 2 million tourists reported to have visited Goa, about 1.2  million of whom were from abroad [75] As of 2013 [update], Goa was a destination of choice for Indian and foreign tourists, particularly Britons and Russians, with limited means who wanted to vacation outside of their countries The state was hopeful that changes could be made which would attract a more upscale demographic [76]\n\n\nHistoric sites and neighbourhoods\nGoa has one World Heritage Site: the Bom Jesus Basilica [80] with churches and convents of Old Goa The basilica holds the mortal remains of Francis Xavier, regarded by many Catholics as the patron saint of Goa (the patron of the Archdiocese of Goa is actually Saint Joseph Vaz) These are both Portuguese-era monuments and reflect a strong European character The relics are taken down for veneration and for public viewing, per the prerogative of the Church in Goa, not every ten or twelve years as popularly thought and propagated The last exposition was held in 2014 [81]\n\n\nMuseums and science centre\nGoa has three important museums: the Goa State Museum, the Naval Aviation Museum and the National Institute of Oceanography The aviation museum is one of three in India (the others are in Delhi and Bangalore) The Goa Science Centre is in Miramar, Panaji [85] The National Institute of Oceanography, India (NIO) is in Dona Paula [86] Museum of Goa is a privately owned contemporary art gallery in Pilerne Industrial Estate, near Calangute [87]\n\n\nBeaches\nMost of the beauty of Goa is present on the beaches The coastline of about 103 kilometres (64 mi) has some of the most attractive beaches flanked by the Arabian Sea The beaches of Goa are counted among the most beautiful in the world [88] [non-primary source needed] Some of the beaches include Anjuna Beach, Baga Beach, Bambolim Beach, Betul Beach, Calangute Beach, Candolim Beach, Cavelossim Beach, Colva Beach, Butterfly Beach, Majorda Beach and Miramar Beach [citation needed]\n\n\nCulture\nHaving been a Portuguese territory for over 450 years, Goan culture is an amalgamation of both Eastern and Western styles, with the latter having a more dominant role

and one Central workshop at Porvorim and a Head Office at Porvorim [134] In large towns such as Panaji and Margao, intra-city buses operate However, public transport in Goa is less developed, and residents depend heavily on their own transportation, usually motorised two-wheelers and small family cars [citation needed]\n\n\nRail\nGoa has two rail lines – one run by the South Western Railway and the other by the Konkan Railway The line run by the South Western Railway was built during the colonial era linking the port town of Vasco da Gama, Goa with Belgaum, Hubli, Karnataka via Margao

Metro\nIndian scientist B Rajaram started the ambitious Skybus Metro project under the Konkan Railway Corporation in partnership with Bharat Earth Movers Limited (BEML) Like the Wuppertal Schwebebahn in Germany, the scheme proposed an elevated, suspended railway layout where vehicles would swing from above lines The objective was to minimize urban congestion by offering a quick and effective urban transportation alternative.\n\n\nSea\nThe Mormugao Port Trust near the city of Vasco handles mineral ore, petroleum, coal, and international containers Much of the shipments consist of minerals and ores from Goa's hinterland Panaji, which is on the banks of the Mandovi, has a minor port, which used to handle passengers steamers between Goa and Mumbai till the late 1980s There was also a short-lived catamaran service linking Mumbai and Panaji operated by Damania Shipping in the 1990s [citation needed]\n\n\nOrganised crime\n\n\nSister states\n\n\nSee

beaches, and vibrant tourist industry. Located on the Konkan coast, Goa is a popular destination for travelers from around the world. The state has a unique blend of Indian and Portuguese cultures, reflecting its history as a Portuguese colony.\n\n**Etymology**\nThe name \"Goa\" is derived from the Konkani word \"Gomantak,\" which refers to the region's fertile soil. The name was later adopted by the Portuguese, who ruled the region from the 16th to the 20th centuries. During this period, the Portuguese established a series of fortifications, churches, and other architectural landmarks that still stand today.\n\n**History**\nThe history of Goa dates back to the 3rd century BC, when the region was part of the Maurya Empire. The Buddhist emperor Ashoka of Magadha ruled the region during this period, and Buddhist monks laid the foundation of Buddhism in Goa. Between the 2nd century BC and the 6th century AD, Goa was ruled by a series of kingdoms and dynasties, including the Bhojas, Chutus, and Western Kshatrapas. The region was later ruled by the Abhiras, Bhojas, and Konkan Mauryas as feudatories of the Kalachuris.\n\nIn the 13th century, Goa was invaded by the Delhi Sultanate, and the region was ruled by the Bahmani Sultanate from 1345 to 1470. The region was later ruled by the Vijayanagara Empire, which was established in 1336. In 1510, the Portuguese defeated the ruling Bijapur sultan Yusuf Adil Shah with the help of a local ally, Thimmayya, and set up a permanent settlement in Velha Goa (Old Goa). This marked the beginning of Portuguese colonial rule in Goa, which would last for four and a half centuries.\n\n**Prehistory**\nThe prehistory of Goa dates back to the Paleolithic era, when humans first inhabited the region. Rock art engravings found in Goa are some of the earliest known traces of human life in India. The engravings, which date back to around 10,000 years ago, depict animals, tectiforms, and other designs in granite. The engravings are found in various locations in Goa, including Kazur, Mauxim, and the Mandovi-Zuari basin.\n\n**Early History**\nIn the 3rd century BC, Goa was part of the Maurya Empire, ruled by the Buddhist emperor Ashoka of Magadha.

This marked the beginning of Portuguese colonial rule in Goa, which would last for four and a half centuries. The Portuguese established a series of fortifications, churches, and other architectural landmarks that still stand today.\n\nThe Goa Inquisition, a formal tribunal, was established in 1560, and was finally abolished in 1812. During this period, the Portuguese also introduced Christianity to the region, and many Goans converted to the new religion.\n\n**Contemporary Period**\nAfter India gained independence from British rule in 1947, India requested that Portuguese territories on the Indian subcontinent be ceded to India. Portugal refused to negotiate on the sovereignty of its Indian enclaves. On 19 December 1961, the Indian Army invaded Goa, and the state was annexed into the Indian union. Goa, Daman, and Diu were organized as a single centrally administered union territory of India.\n\nIn 1967, a referendum was held in Goa, in which the people of the state voted to continue as a union territory, rather than merging with the state of Maharashtra. On 30 May 1987, the union territory was split, and Goa was made India's twenty-fifth state, with Daman and Diu remaining a union territory.\n\n**Geography**\nGoa encompasses an area of 3,702 square kilometers (1,429 square miles).

[66]\n\n\nReligion\nReligion in Goa (2011) [62]\n\n\nTourism\nTourism is generally focused on the coastal areas of Goa, with lower tourist activity inland In 2010, there were more than 2 million tourists reported to have visited Goa, about 1.2  million of whom were from abroad [75] As of 2013 [update], Goa was a destination of choice for Indian and foreign tourists, particularly Britons and Russians, with limited means who wanted to vacation outside of their countries The state was hopeful that changes could be made which would attract a more upscale demographic [76]\n\n\nHistoric sites and neighbourhoods\nGoa has one World Heritage Site: the Bom Jesus Basilica [80] with churches and convents of Old Goa The basilica holds the mortal remains of Francis Xavier, regarded by many Catholics as the patron saint of Goa (the patron of the Archdiocese of Goa is actually Saint Joseph Vaz) These are both Portuguese-era monuments and reflect a strong European character The relics are taken down for veneration and for public viewing, per the prerogative of the Church in Goa, not every ten or twelve years as popularly thought and propagated The last exposition was held in 2014 [81]\n\n\nMuseums and science centre\nGoa has three important museums: the Goa State Museum, the Naval Aviation Museum and the National Institute of Oceanography The aviation museum is one of three in India (the others are in Delhi and Bangalore) The Goa Science Centre is in Miramar, Panaji [85] The National Institute of Oceanography, India (NIO) is in Dona Paula [86] Museum of Goa is a privately owned contemporary art gallery in Pilerne Industrial Estate, near Calangute [87]\n\n\nBeaches\nMost of the beauty of Goa is present on the beaches The coastline of about 103 kilometres (64 mi) has some of the most attractive beaches flanked by the Arabian Sea The beaches of Goa are counted among the most beautiful in the world [88] [non-primary source needed] Some of the beaches include Anjuna Beach, Baga Beach, Bambolim Beach, Betul Beach, Calangute Beach, Candolim Beach, Cavelossim Beach, Colva Beach, Butterfly Beach, Majorda Beach and Miramar Beach [citation needed]\n\n\nCulture\nHaving been a Portuguese territory for over 450 years, Goan culture is an amalgamation of both Eastern and Western styles, with the latter having a more dominant role The tableau of Goa showcases religious harmony by focusing on the Deepastambha, the Cross, and Ghode Modni followed by a chariot European royal attire of kings is as much part of Goa's cultural heritage as are regional dances performed depicting a unique blend of different religions and cultures of this State Prominent local festivals are Christmas, Easter, Carnival, Diwali, Shigmo, Chavoth, Samvatsar Padvo, Dasara etc The Goan Carnival and Christmas-new year celebrations attract many tourists [citation needed]\n\n\nDance and music\nTraditional Goan art forms are Dekhnni, Fugdi, Corridinho, Mando, Dulpod and Fado [91]\n\n\nTheatre\nNatak, Tiatr (most popular) and Jagor are the chief forms of Goa's traditional performance arts Other forms are Ranmale, Dashavatari, Kalo, Goulankala, Lalit, Kala and Rathkala [citation needed] Stories from the Ramayana and the Mahabharata along with more modern social subjects are narrated with song and dance [92] [93]\n\n\nKonkani cinema\nKonkani cinema is an Indian film industry, where films are made in the Konkani language, which is spoken mainly in the Indian states of Goa, Maharashtra and Karnataka and to a smaller extent in Kerala Konkani films have been produced in Goa, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Kerala [95]\n\n\nFood\nRice with fish curry (xit koddi in Konkani) is the staple diet in Goa Goan cuisine is famous for its rich variety of fish dishes cooked with elaborate recipes Coconut and coconut oil are widely used in Goan cooking along with chili peppers, spices, and vinegar, used in the Catholic cuisine, giving the food a unique flavor Goan cuisine is heavily influenced by Portuguese cuisine [citation needed]\n\n\nArchitecture\nThe architecture of Goa is a combination of native Goan, Ottoman and Portuguese styles Since the Portuguese ruled and governed for four centuries, many churches and houses bear a striking element of the Portuguese style of architecture Goan Hindu houses do not show any Portuguese influence, though the modern temple architecture is an amalgam of original Goan temple style with Dravidian, Hemadpanti, Islamic, and Portuguese architecture [106] The original Goan temple architecture fell into disuse as the temples were demolished by the Portuguese and the Sthapati known as Thavayi in Konkani were converted to Christianity though the wooden work and the Kavi murals can still be seen [107]\n\n\nNotable people\nFamous people from Goa encompass various categories, such as architects, artists, engineers, governors, indologists & archaeologists, lawyers & judges, military personnel, models and pageant winners, politicians, individuals in the field of education, scientists and researchers, athletes, writers, editors, and journalists, as well as activists.\n\n\nMedia and communication\nHistorically, the media in Goa grew in the late 1800's before being clamped down on during the rule of António de Oliveira Salazar The first printing press in Goa was founded in 1556 [citation needed] In 1886, Tipografia Rangel, one of the pioneers in widescale publishing was founded [108] Prior to this the only existing presses were those of the government and individual family presses existing to print the political newspapers Tipografia Rangel was among the leaders in providing print media to  a larger section of society in Goa [citation needed]\n\n\nSports\nNormally other states are fond of cricket but association football is the most popular sport in Goa and is embedded in Goan culture as a result of the Portuguese influence [114] Its origins in the state are traced back to 1883 when the visiting Irish priest Fr William Robert Lyons established the sport as part of a \"Christian education\" [114] [115] On 22 December 1959, the Associação de Futebol de Goa was formed, which continues to administer the game in the state under the new name Goa Football Association [114] Goa, along with West Bengal and Kerala [114] is the locus of football in India and is home to many football clubs in the national I-League The state's football powerhouses include Salgaocar, Dempo, Churchill Brothers, Vasco, Sporting Clube de Goa and FC Goa The first Unity World Cup was held in Goa in 2014 The state's main football stadium, Fatorda Stadium, is located at Margao and also hosts cricket matches [116] The state hosted few matches of the 2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup and several matches of the 2022 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup in Fatorda Stadium [117] [118]\n\n\nEducation\nGoa had India's earliest educational institutions built with European support The Portuguese set up seminaries for religious education and parish schools for elementary education Founded c. 1542 by Saint Francis Xavier, Saint Paul's College, Goa was a Jesuit school in Old Goa, which later became a college St Paul's was once the main Jesuit institution in Asia It housed the first printing press in India and published the first books in 1556 [122] [123] [124]\n\n\nTransportation\nGoa is served by two international Airports Goa International Airport, is a civil enclave at INS Hansa, a Naval airfield [130] located at Dabolim, near Vasco da Gama while the Manohar International Airport is located in the North at Mopa [131] \nWithin five months of its inception, Mopa airport began handling 30 per cent of all air traffic of Goa [132] \nThe airports cater to scheduled domestic and international air services, with the new airport having started international operations from March 2023 [133]\nGoa has scheduled international connections to Doha, Dubai, Muscat, Sharjah and Kuwait in the Middle East by airlines like Air Arabia, Air India, GoAir, IndiGo, Oman Air, SpiceJet and Qatar Airways.\n\n\nAir\nGoa is served by two international Airports Goa International Airport, is a civil enclave at INS

Corporation, link major routes (like the Panaji–Margao route) and some remote parts of the state The Corporation owns 15 bus stands, 4 depots and one Central workshop at Porvorim and a Head Office at Porvorim [134] In large towns such as Panaji and Margao, intra-city buses operate However, public transport in Goa is less developed, and residents depend heavily on their own transportation, usually motorised two-wheelers and small family cars [citation needed]\n\n\nRail\nGoa has two rail lines – one run by the South Western Railway and the other by the Konkan Railway The line run by the South Western Railway was built during the colonial era linking the port town of Vasco da Gama, Goa with Belgaum, Hubli, Karnataka via Margao The Konkan Railway line, which was built during the 1990s, runs parallel to the coast connecting major cities on the western coast [citation needed]\n\n\nMetro\nIn 2018, a metro rail was planned by the NITI Aayog, linking the capital city of Panaji In the future, it would be extended from South Goa till the coastal city of Karwar in Karnataka, close to the Kanataka-Goa border [141]\n\n\nSkybus Metro\nIndian scientist B Rajaram started the ambitious Skybus Metro project under the Konkan Railway Corporation in partnership with Bharat Earth Movers Limited (BEML) Like the Wuppertal Schwebebahn in Germany, the scheme proposed an elevated, suspended railway layout where vehicles would swing from above lines The objective was to minimize urban congestion by offering a quick and effective urban transportation alternative.\n\n\nSea\nThe Mormugao Port Trust near the city of Vasco handles mineral ore, petroleum, coal, and international containers Much of the shipments consist of minerals and ores from Goa's hinterland Panaji, which is on the banks of the Mandovi, has a minor port, which used to handle passengers steamers between Goa and Mumbai till the late 1980s There was also a short-lived catamaran service linking Mumbai and Panaji operated by Damania Shipping in the 1990s [citation needed]\n\n\nOrganised crime\n\n\nSister states\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal

Walter now works as a children's book publisher at the Empire State Building in New York City, unaware of Buddy's existence.\n\nBuddy travels to New York City to meet his father, but his innocence and childlike wonder clash with the city's fast-paced and cynical atmosphere. Despite the initial shock and confusion, Walter eventually warms up to Buddy and helps him find his place in the world.

{"title": "South_Sudan", "content": "\nEtymology\nThe name Sudan is a name given to a geographical region to the south of the Sahara, stretching from Western Africa to eastern Central Africa The name derives from the Arabic bilād as-sūdān (بلاد السودان), or the \"Land of the Blacks\" [29] The term was used by Arab traders and travelers in the region to refer to the various indigenous black African cultures and societies that they encountered [30]\n\n\nHistory\nThe Nilotic people of South Sudan—the Dinka, Anyuak, Bari, Acholi, Nuer, Shilluk, Kaligi (Arabic Feroghe), and others—first entered South Sudan sometime before the tenth century, coinciding with the fall of medieval Nubia From the 15th to the 19th century, tribal migrations, largely from the area of Bahr el Ghazal, brought the Anyuak, Dinka, Nuer, and Shilluk to their modern locations in Bahr El Ghazal and the Upper Nile Region, while the Acholi and Bari settled in Equatoria The Zande, Mundu, Avukaya and Baka, who entered South Sudan in the 16th century, established the region's largest state of Equatoria Region [citation needed]\n\n\nIndependence (2011)\nBetween 9 and 15 January 2011, as a consequence of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, the South Sudanese independence referendum was held to determine whether South Sudan should become an independent country, separate from Sudan Following that, 98.83% of those who took part in the referendum voted for separation or independence [41] And on 23 January 2011, members of a steering committee on post-independence governing told reporters that upon independence the land would be named the Republic of South Sudan \"out of familiarity and convenience\" Other names that had been considered were Azania, Nile Republic, Kush Republic and even Juwama, a portmanteau for Juba, Wau and Malakal, three major cities [42] South Sudan formally became independent from Sudan on 9 July, although certain disputes still remained, including the division of oil revenues, as 75% of all the former Sudan's oil reserves are in South Sudan [43] The region of Abyei still remains disputed and a separate referendum will be held in Abyei on whether they want to join Sudan or South Sudan [44] The South Kordofan conflict broke out in June 2011 between the Army of Sudan and the SPLA over the Nuba Mountains.\n\n\nCivil War (2013–2020)\nOn the 5th of September 2013, an article written by analyst Duop Chak Wuol was published by the US-based South Sudan News Agency (SSNA) [56] The writer raised critical questions surrounding what he described as the rise of autocracy within the top leadership of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) and warned of monumental repercussions unless the ruling elites restored the founding principles of the party Duop also berated the ruling party, arguing that the party has replaced its founding principles with \"forgotten promises and deceptions\" In December 2013, a political power struggle broke out between President Kiir and his former deputy Riek Machar, as the president accused Machar and ten others of attempting a coup d'état [57] Fighting broke out, igniting the South Sudanese Civil War Ugandan troops were deployed to fight alongside South Sudanese government forces against the rebels [58] The United Nations has peacekeepers in the country as part of the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) Numerous ceasefires were mediated by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) between the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) and SPLM – in opposition and were subsequently broken A peace agreement was signed in Ethiopia under threat of United Nations sanctions for both sides in August 2015 [59] Machar returned to Juba in 2016 and was appointed vice president [60] Following a second breakout of violence in Juba, Machar was replaced as vice-president [61] and he fled the country [62] as the conflict erupted again Rebel in-fighting has become a major part of the conflict [63] Rivalry among Dinka factions led by the President and Malong Awan has also led to fighting In August 2018, another power-sharing agreement came into effect [64]\n\n\nAdmission into the EAC and planned democratic elections (2016–)\nSouth Sudan acceded to the Treaty of the East Africa Community on 15 April 2016 and became a full member on 15 August 2016 [72] South Sudan, Democratic Republic of Congo and Federal Republic of Somalia are the newest members of the East African Community.\n\n\n2017 famine\nOn 20 February 2017, South Sudan and the United Nations declared a famine in parts of former Unity State, with the warning that it could spread rapidly without further action Over 100,000 people were affected The UN World Food Programme said that 40% of the population of South Sudan, 4.9 million people, need food urgently [75] [76] U.N officials said that President Salva Kiir Mayardit was blocking food deliveries to some areas [77] Furthermore, UNICEF warned that more than 1 million children in South Sudan were subjected to malnutrition [78]\n\n\nGeography\nSouth Sudan lies between latitudes 3° and 13°N, and longitudes 24° and 36°E It is covered in tropical forest, swamps, and grassland The White Nile passes through the country, passing by Juba [80]  The Sudd is formed by the White Nile, known locally as the Bahr al Jabal, meaning \"Mountain Sea\" [81]\n\n\nClimate\nSouth Sudan has a tropical climate, characterized by a rainy season of high humidity and large amounts of rainfall followed by a drier season The temperature on average is always high with July being the coolest month with average temperatures falling between 20 and 30 °C (68 and 86 °F) and March being the warmest month with average temperatures ranging from 23 to 37 °C (73 to 98 °F) [84]\n\n\nWildlife\nThe now defunct Southern Sudan Legislative Assembly ratified a transitional constitution [87] shortly before independence on 9 July 2011 [88] The constitution was signed by the President of South Sudan, Salva Kiir Mayardit, on Independence Day and thereby came into force It is now the supreme law of the land, superseding the Interim Constitution of 2005 [89]\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nThe now defunct Southern Sudan Legislative Assembly ratified a transitional constitution [87] shortly before independence on 9 July 2011 [88] The constitution was signed by the President of South Sudan, Salva Kiir Mayardit, on Independence Day and thereby came into force It is now the supreme law of the land, superseding the Interim Constitution of 2005

President of South Sudan, Salva Kiir Mayardit, on Independence Day and thereby came into force It is now the supreme law of the land, superseding the Interim Constitution of 2005 [89]\n\n\nNational capital project\nThe capital of South Sudan is located at Juba, which is also the state capital of Central Equatoria and the county seat of the eponymous Juba County, and is the country's largest city However, due to Juba's poor infrastructure and massive urban growth, as well as its lack of centrality within South Sudan, the South Sudanese Government adopted a resolution in February 2011 to study the creation of a new planned city to serve as the seat of government [93] [94] It is planned that the capital city will be changed to the more centrally located Ramciel [95] This proposal is functionally similar to construction projects in Abuja, Nigeria; Brasília, Brazil; and Canberra, Australia; among other modern-era planned national capitals It is unclear how the government will fund the project.\n\n\nStates\n\tPrior to 2015, South Sudan was divided into ten states, which also correspond to three historical regions: Bahr el Ghazal, Equatoria, and Greater Upper Nile region which includes Nuerland:\n\n\n2011–2015\n\tPrior to 2015, South Sudan was divided into ten states, which also correspond to three historical regions: Bahr el Ghazal, Equatoria, and Greater Upper Nile region which includes Nuerland:\n\n\n2015–2020\nIn October 2015, South Sudan's President Salva Kiir issued a decree establishing twenty-eight states in place of the ten constitutionally established states [99] The decree established the new states largely along ethnic lines A number of opposition parties and civil society challenged the constitutionality of this decree and Kiir later resolved to take it to parliament for approval as a constitutional amendment [100] In November the South Sudanese parliament empowered President Kiir to create new states [101]\n\n\n2020–present\nUnder the terms of a peace agreement signed on 22 February 2020, South Sudan is again divided into ten states, with two administrative areas and one area with special administrative status [104] [105]\n\n\nForeign relations\nSince independence, relations with Sudan have been changing Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir first announced, in January 2011, that dual citizenship in the North and the South would be allowed, [80] but upon the independence of South Sudan he retracted the offer He has also suggested an EU-style confederation [106] Essam Sharaf, Prime Minister of Egypt after the 2011 Egyptian Revolution, made his first foreign visit to Khartoum and Juba in the lead-up to South Sudan's secession [107] Israel quickly recognized South Sudan as an independent country, [108] and is host to thousands of refugees from South Sudan, many of whom have finally been granted temporary resident status more than a decade later [109] According to American sources, President Obama officially recognised the new state after Sudan, Egypt, Germany and Kenya were among the first to recognise the country's independence on 8 July 2011 [110] [111] Several states that participated in the international negotiations concluded with a self-determination referendum were also quick to acknowledge the overwhelming result The Rationalist process included Kenya, Uganda, Egypt, Ethiopia, Libya, Eritrea, the United Kingdom and Norway [112] [a]\n\n\nMilitary\nA Defence paper was initiated in 2007 by then Minister for SPLA Affairs Dominic Dim Deng, and a draft was produced in 2008 It declared that Southern Sudan would eventually maintain land, air, and riverine forces [134] [135]\n\n\nHuman rights\nCampaigns of atrocities against civilians have been attributed to the SPLA [137] In the SPLA/M's attempt to disarm rebellions among the Shilluk and Murle, they burned scores of villages, raped hundreds of women and girls and killed an untold number of civilians [138] Civilians alleging torture claim fingernails being torn out, burning plastic bags dripped on children to make their parents hand over weapons, and villagers burned alive in their huts if it was suspected that rebels had spent the night there [138] In May 2011, the SPLA allegedly set fire to over 7,000 homes in Unity State [139]\n\n\nEconomy\nThe economy of South Sudan is one of the world's most underdeveloped, [151] with South Sudan having little existing infrastructure and the highest maternal mortality and female illiteracy rates in the world as of 2011 [update] [152] South Sudan exports timber to the international market The region also contains many natural resources such as petroleum, iron ore, copper, chromium ore, zinc, tungsten, mica, silver, gold, diamonds, hardwoods, limestone and hydropower [153] The country's economy, as in many other developing countries, is heavily dependent on agriculture.\n\n\nOil\nThe oilfields in South Sudan have been significant to the economy since the latter part of the 20th century In 2023, oil constitutes more than 90% of state revenues [151] The country has the third-largest oil reserves in Sub-Saharan Africa [154] However, after South Sudan became an independent nation in July 2011, southern and northern negotiators were not immediately able to reach an agreement on how to split the revenue from these southern oilfields [155]\n\n\nDebt\nIn terms of South Sudan's external debt, Sudan and South Sudan maintain a shared debt of approximately US$38 billion, all of which has accumulated throughout the past five decades [160] Though a small portion of this debt is owed to such international institutions as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (approximately US$5.3 billion according to a 2009 report provided by the Bank of Sudan), the bulk of its debt load is actually owed to numerous foreign actors that have provided the nation with financial loans, including the Paris Club (over US$11 billion) and also non-Paris Club bilateral creditors (over US$13 billion) [161]\n\n\nEast African Community membership\nThe presidents of Kenya and Rwanda invited the Autonomous Government of Southern Sudan to apply for membership to the East African Community upon the independence of South Sudan in 2011, [115] [164] and South Sudan was reportedly an applicant country as of mid-July 2011 [115] [165] Analysts suggested that South Sudan's early efforts to integrate infrastructure, including rail links and oil pipelines, [166] with systems in Kenya and Uganda indicated intention on the part of Juba to pivot away from dependence on Sudan and toward the EAC.\n\n\nSouth Sudan and the Commonwealth of Nations\nSouth Sudan has applied to join the Commonwealth of Nations, [178] considering that South Sudan was part of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, and has two republics in the Commonwealth of Nations, Kenya and Uganda, as neighbouring countries.\n\n\nTransport\nRoad transport is the most common and cheapest means of transport used in the country.\n\n\nRailway\nSouth Sudan has 248 km (154 mi) of single-track 1,067 mm (3 ft 6 in) gauge railway line from the Sudanese border to Wau terminus There are proposed extensions from Wau to Juba There are also plans to link Juba with the Kenyan and Ugandan railway networks.\n\n\nAir\nThe busiest and most developed airport in South Sudan is Juba Airport, which has regular international connections to Asmara, Entebbe, Nairobi, Cairo, Addis Ababa, and Khartoum Juba Airport was also the home base of Feeder Airlines Company and Southern Star Airlines [179]\n\n\nWater crisis\nThe water supply in South Sudan is faced with numerous challenges Although the White Nile runs through the country, water is scarce during the dry season in areas that are not located on the river.\n\n\nDemographics\nSouth Sudan has a population of approximately 11 million [183] [184] and a predominantly rural, subsistence economy This region has been negatively affected by war for all but 10 of the years since 1956, resulting in serious neglect, lack of infrastructure development, and major destruction and displacement More than 2 million people have died, and more than 4 million are internally displaced persons or became refugees as a result of the civil war and its impact.\n\n\nPopulation\nThe \"Fifth Population and Housing Census of Sudan\", for Sudan as a whole, was conducted in April 2008 The census counted the Southern Sudan population at 8.26 million; [185] [186] however, Southern Sudanese officials rejected the census results of Southern Sudan because \"the central bureau of statistics in Khartoum refused to share the national Sudan raw census data with the southern Sudan centre for census, statistics and evaluation\" [187]\n\n\n2008 census\nThe \"Fifth Population and Housing Census of Sudan\", for Sudan as a whole, was conducted in April 2008 The census counted the Southern Sudan population at 8.26 million; [185] [186] however, Southern Sudanese officials rejected the census results of Southern Sudan because \"the central bureau of statistics in Khartoum refused to share the national Sudan raw census data with the southern Sudan centre for census, statistics and evaluation\" [187]\n\n\n2009 census\nIn 2009, Sudan initiated a Southern Sudanese census ahead of the 2011 independence referendum, which would also include the South Sudanese diaspora; however, this initiative was criticised for leaving out countries with a high share of the South Sudanese diaspora, rather counting countries where the diaspora share was low [190]\n\n\nEthnic groups\nThe major ethnic groups present in South Sudan are the Dinka at approximately 40 percent of the population, the Nuer at approximately 20 percent, and the Azande at approximately 10 percent, as well as the Shilluk and Bari [191] Currently, around 800,000 expatriates from the Horn of Africa are living in South Sudan  [citation needed]\n\n\nDiaspora\nThe South Sudanese diaspora consists of citizens of South Sudan residing abroad The number of South Sudanese outside South Sudan has sharply increased since the beginning of the struggle for independence from Sudan Almost one and a half million South Sudanese have left the country as refugees, either permanently or as temporary workforce, leading to the establishment of the South Sudanese diaspora population [citation needed]\n\n\nLargest cities\nThere are 70 languages spoken in South Sudan, of which 60 are indigenous and granted constitutional status as \"national languages\" that \"shall be respected, developed and promoted\" [195] English is the sole official language, [1] being constitutionally enshrined as the \"official working language\" of government and the \"language of instruction at all levels of education\" [196] English had been the principal language of what is now South Sudan since 1972, serving as the common medium for administrative purposes [197] However, few South Sudanese speak it as a first language [198]\n\n\nLanguages\nThere are 70 languages spoken in South Sudan, of which 60 are indigenous and

\"official working language\" of government and the \"language of instruction at all levels of education\" [196] English had been the principal language of what is now South Sudan since 1972, serving as the common medium for administrative purposes [197] However, few South Sudanese speak it as a first language [198]\n\n\nReligion\nReligions followed by the South Sudanese include Christianity, [208] various traditional indigenous belief systems, and Islam [209] [210] Exact figures are lacking due to internal displacement from ongoing conflict, large numbers of frequently-migrating pastoralists, and insufficient government resources [211] [212] The last official census to take into account religion was in 1956, where a majority of people were classified as adherents of traditional beliefs or Christianity, while 18% were Muslim [213]\n\n\nEducation\nUnlike the previous educational system of the regional Southern Sudan—which was modelled after the system used in the Republic of Sudan since 1990—the current educational system of the Republic of South Sudan follows the 8 + 4 + 4 system (similar to Kenya) Primary education consists of eight years, followed by four years of secondary education, and then four years of university instruction.\n\n\nHealth and humanitarian situation\nAccording to the United Nations, there are 8.3 million people in need of humanitarian aid in South Sudan as of January 2021 [234] South Sudan is acknowledged to have some of the worst health indicators in the world [235] [236] [237] The under-five infant mortality rate is 135.3 per 1,000, whilst maternal mortality is the highest in the world at 2,053.9 per 100,000 live births [237] In 2004, there were only three surgeons serving in southern Sudan, with three proper hospitals, and in some areas there was just one doctor for every 500,000 people [235]\n\n\nRefugees\nAs of February 2014, South Sudan was host to over 230,000 refugees, with the vast majority, over 209,000, having arrived recently from Sudan, because of the War in Darfur Other African countries that contribute the most refugees to South Sudan are the Central African Republic, Ethiopia, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo [250] As a result of the war that erupted in December 2013, more than 2.3 million people – one in every five people in South Sudan – have been forced to flee their homes, including 1.66 million internally displaced people (with 53.4 per cent estimated to be children) and nearly 644,900 refugees in neighbouring countries Some 185,000 internally displaced people (IDPs) have sought refuge in UN Protection of Civilians (PoC) sites, while around 90 percent of IDPs are on the run or sheltering outside PoC sites [251] Consequently, UNHCR is stepping up its response through an inter-agency collaborative approach under the leadership of the Humanitarian Coordinator, and working with the International Organization for Migration (IOM) In early February 2013, UNHCR started distributing relief items outside the UN base in Malakal, South Sudan, which was expected to reach 10,000 people [250]\n\n\nCulture\nDue to the many years of civil war, South Sudan's culture is heavily influenced by its neighbours Many South Sudanese fled to Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda where they interacted with the nationals and learned their languages and culture Most of those who remained in Sudan until or after independence partially assimilated to Sudanese culture and speak Juba Arabic or Sudanese Arabic.\n\n\nMusic\nMany music artists from South Sudan use English, Swahili, Juba Arabic, their native African language or a mix of all Popular artists like Barbz, Yaba Angelosi, De Peace Child sing Afro-beat, R&B, and Zouk; Dynamq is popular for his reggae releases; and Emmanuel Kembe who sings folk, reggae and Afro-beat [252] Also hip hop artists like Emmanuel Jal, FTG Metro, Flizzame and Dugga Mulla (of FMG) Emmanuel being one of the South Sudaneses music artists who have broken through on an international level [253] with his unique form of hip hop and a positive message in his lyrics [254] Jal, a former child soldier turned musician, received good airplay and album reviews in the UK [255] and has also been sought out for the lecture circuit with major talks at popular talkfests like TED [256]\n\n\nMedia\nWhile former Information Minister Barnaba Marial Benjamin vowed that South Sudan will respect freedom of the press and allow journalists unrestricted access in the country, the chief editor of Juba newspaper The Citizen claimed that in the absence of a formal media law in the fledgling republic, he and his staff have faced abuse at the hands of security forces This alleged fettering of media freedom was attributed in an Al Jazeera report to the difficulty SPLM has faced in reforming itself as a legitimate government after years of leading a rebellion against the Sudanese government The Citizen is South Sudan's largest newspaper, but poor infrastructure and poverty have kept its staff relatively small and limited the efficiency of both its reporting and its circulation outside of Juba, with no dedicated news bureaus in outlying states and newspapers often taking several days to reach states like Northern Bahr el Ghazal [257] In May 2020, South Sudan Friendship Press was established as the country's first dedicated online news website [258]\nNile citizens  is laid out as the nation's committed web-based news site [259]\n\n\nCensorship\nOn 1 November 2011, South Sudan's National Security Services (NSS) arrested the editor of a private Juba-based daily, Destiny, and suspended its activities indefinitely This was in response to an opinion article by columnist Dengdit Ayok, entitled \"Let Me Say So\", which criticized the president for allowing his daughter to marry an Ethiopian national, and accused him of \"staining his patriotism\" An official letter accused the newspaper of breaking \"the media code of conduct and professional ethics\", and of publishing \"illicit news\" that was defamatory, inciting, and invading the privacy of personalities The Committee to Protect Journalists had voiced concerns over media freedoms in South Sudan in September [260] The NSS released the journalists without charge after having held them for 18 days [261]\n\n\nSports\nMany traditional and modern games and sports are popular in South Sudan, particularly wrestling and mock battles The traditional sports were mainly played after the harvest seasons to celebrate the harvests and finish the farming seasons During the matches, they smeared themselves with ochre – perhaps to enhance the grip or heighten their perception The matches attracted large numbers of spectators who sang, played drums and danced in support of their favourite wrestlers Though these were perceived as competition, they were primarily for entertainment [270]\nAssociation football is also becoming popular in South Sudan, and there are many initiatives by the Government of South Sudan and other partners to promote the sport and improve the level of play One of these initiatives is South Sudan Youth Sports Association (SSYSA) SSYSA is already holding football clinics in Konyokonyo and Muniki areas of Juba in which young boys are coached In recognition of these efforts with youth football, the country recently hosted the CECAFA youth football competitions Barely a month earlier, it had also hosted the larger East African Schools Sports tournaments [citation needed]\n\n\nSee also\n8°N 30°E﻿ / ﻿8°N 30°E﻿ / 8;

It gained independence from Sudan on July 9, 2011, after a long and brutal civil war. The country has a diverse population, with over 60 ethnic groups, and a rich cultural heritage. This article will provide an overview of South Sudan's history, geography, government, economy, and culture.\n\nEtymology\nThe name Sudan is a name given to a geographical region to the south of the Sahara, stretching from Western Africa to eastern Central Africa. The name derives from the Arabic bilād as-sūdān (بلاد السودان), or the \"Land of the Blacks\". The term was used by Arab traders and travelers in the region to refer to the various indigenous black African cultures and societies that they encountered.\n\nHistory\nThe Nilotic people of South Sudan—the Dinka, Anyuak, Bari, Acholi, Nuer, Shilluk, Kaligi (Arabic Feroghe), and others—first entered South Sudan sometime before the tenth century, coinciding with the fall of medieval Nubia. From the 15th to the 19th century, tribal migrations, largely from the area of Bahr el Ghazal, brought the Anyuak, Dinka, Nuer, and Shilluk to their modern locations in Bahr El Ghazal and the Upper Nile Region, while the Acholi and Bari settled in Equatoria.\n\nIndependence (2011)\nBetween 9 and 15 January 2011, as a consequence of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, the South Sudanese independence referendum was held to determine whether South Sudan should become an independent country, separate from Sudan. Following that, 98.83% of those who took part in the referendum voted for separation or independence. On 23 January 2011, members of a steering committee on post-independence governing told reporters that upon independence the land would be named the Republic of South Sudan \"out of familiarity and convenience\". Other names that had been considered were Azania, Nile Republic, Kush Republic, and even Juwama, a portmanteau for Juba, Wau, and Malakal, three major cities.\n\nCivil War (2013–2020)\nOn the 5th of September 2013, an article written by analyst Duop Chak Wuol was published by the US-based South Sudan News Agency (SSNA). The writer raised critical questions surrounding what he described as the rise of autocracy within the top leadership of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) and warned of monumental repercussions unless the ruling elites restored the founding principles of the party. Duop also berated the ruling party, arguing that the party has replaced its founding principles with \"forgotten promises and deceptions\".\n\nGeography\nSouth Sudan lies between latitudes 3° and 13°N, and longitudes 24° and 36°E. It is covered in tropical forest, swamps, and grassland. The White Nile passes through the country, passing by Juba. The Sudd is formed by the White Nile, known locally as the Bahr al Jabal, meaning \"Mountain Sea\".\n\nClimate\nSouth Sudan has a tropical climate, characterized by a rainy season of high humidity and large amounts of rainfall followed by a drier season. The temperature on average is always high, with July being the coolest month with average temperatures falling between 20 and 30°C (68 and 86°F) and March being the warmest month with average temperatures ranging from 23 to 37°C (73 to 98°F).\n\nWildlife\nThe country's wildlife is diverse and includes many species of antelopes, buffaloes, and elephants. The country is also home to many birds, including the majestic ostrich and the elegant secretarybird.\n\nGovernment and Politics\nThe government of South Sudan is a federal republic with a president serving as head of state and government. The president is elected by popular vote for a five-year term. The government is divided into three branches: the executive, the legislative, and the judicial.\n\nStates\nPrior to 2015, South Sudan was divided into ten states, which also correspond to three historical regions: Bahr el Ghazal, Equatoria, and Greater Upper Nile region, which includes Nuerland. In October 2015, South Sudan's President Salva Kiir issued a decree establishing twenty-eight states in place of the ten constitutionally established states.\n\nForeign Relations\nSince independence, relations with Sudan have been changing. Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir first announced, in January 2011, that dual citizenship in the North and the South would be allowed. However, upon the independence of South Sudan, he retracted the offer. He has also suggested an EU-style confederation. Israel quickly recognized South Sudan as an independent country, and is host to thousands of refugees from South Sudan, many of whom have finally been granted temporary resident status more than a decade later.\n\nMilitary\nA Defence paper was initiated in 2007 by then Minister for SPLA Affairs Dominic Dim Deng, and a draft was produced in 2008. It declared that Southern Sudan would eventually maintain land, air, and riverine forces.\n\nHuman Rights\nCampaigns of atrocities against civilians have been attributed to the SPLA. In the SPLA/M's attempt to disarm rebellions among the Shilluk and Murle, they burned scores of villages, raped hundreds of women and girls, and killed an untold number of civilians.\n\nEconomy\nThe economy of South Sudan is one of the world's most underdeveloped, with South Sudan having little existing infrastructure and the highest maternal mortality and female illiteracy rates in the world as of 2011. The country exports timber to the international market and contains many natural resources such as petroleum, iron ore, copper, chromium ore, zinc, tungsten, mica, silver, gold, diamonds, hardwoods, limestone, and hydropower.\n\nOil\nThe oilfields in South Sudan have been significant to the economy since the latter part of the 20th century. In 2023, oil constitutes more than 90% of state revenues. The country has the third-largest oil reserves in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nDebt\nIn terms of South Sudan's external debt, Sudan and South Sudan maintain a shared debt of approximately US$38 billion, all of which has accumulated throughout the past five decades.\n\nTransport\nRoad transport is the most common and cheapest means of transport used in the country. The country has a network of roads, including the A1 road, which connects the capital city Juba to the city of Rumbek.\n\nRailway\nSouth Sudan has 248 km of single-track 1,067 mm gauge railway line from the Sudanese border to Wau terminus. There are proposed extensions from Wau to Juba.\n\nAir\nThe busiest and most developed airport in South Sudan is Juba Airport, which has regular international connections to Asmara, Entebbe, Nairobi, Cairo, Addis Ababa, and Khartoum.\n\nWater Crisis\nThe water supply in South Sudan is faced with numerous challenges. Although the White Nile runs through the country, water is scarce during the dry season in areas that are not located on the river.\n\nDemographics\nSouth Sudan has a population of approximately 11 million and a predominantly rural, subsistence economy. The country has been negatively affected by war for all but 10 of the years since 1956, resulting in serious neglect, lack of infrastructure development, and major destruction and displacement.\n\nPopulation\nThe \"Fifth Population and Housing Census of Sudan\", for Sudan as a whole, was conducted in April 2008. The census counted the Southern Sudan population at 8.26 million. However, Southern Sudanese officials rejected the census results of Southern Sudan because the central bureau of statistics in Khartoum refused to share the national Sudan raw census data with the southern Sudan centre for census, statistics, and evaluation.\n\nEthnic Groups\nThe major ethnic groups present in South Sudan are the Dinka at approximately 40 percent of the population, the Nuer at approximately 20 percent, and the Azande at approximately 10 percent, as well as the Shilluk and Bari.\n\nDiaspora\nThe South Sudanese diaspora consists of citizens of South Sudan residing abroad. The number of South Sudanese outside South Sudan has sharply increased since the beginning of the struggle for independence from Sudan.\n\nLargest Cities\nThere are 70 languages spoken in South Sudan, of which 60 are indigenous and granted constitutional status as \"national languages\" that \"shall be respected, developed, and promoted\". English is the sole official language.\n\nLanguages\nThere are 70 languages spoken in South Sudan, of which 60 are indigenous and granted constitutional status as \"national languages\" that \"shall be respected, developed, and promoted\". English is the sole official language.\n\nReligion\nReligions followed by the South Sudanese include Christianity, various traditional indigenous belief systems, and Islam.\n\nEducation\nThe current educational system of the Republic of South Sudan follows the 8 + 4 + 4 system. Primary education consists of eight years, followed by four years of secondary education, and then four years of university instruction.\n\nHealth and Humanitarian Situation\nAccording to the United Nations, there are 8.3 million people in need of humanitarian aid in South Sudan as of January 2021. South Sudan is acknowledged to have some of the worst health indicators in the world.\n\nRefugees\nAs of February 2014, South Sudan was host to over 230,000 refugees, with the vast majority, over 209,000, having arrived recently from Sudan, because of the War in Darfur.\n\nCulture\nDue to the many years of civil war, South Sudan's culture is heavily influenced by its neighbours. Many South Sudanese fled to Ethiopia, Kenya, and Uganda, where they interacted with the nationals and learned their languages and culture.\n\nMusic\nMany music artists from South Sudan use English, Swahili, Juba Arabic, their native African language, or a mix of all. Popular artists like Barbz, Yaba Angelosi, De Peace Child sing Afro-beat, R&B, and Zouk; Dynamq is popular for his reggae releases; and Emmanuel Kembe, who sings folk, reggae, and Afro-beat.\n\nSports\nMany traditional and modern games and sports are popular in South Sudan, particularly wrestling and mock battles. Association football is also becoming popular in South Sudan, and there are many initiatives by the Government of South Sudan and other partners to promote the sport and improve the level of play.\n\nSee also\nThis article does not have any citations.\n\nReferences\nThis article does not have any references.\n\nFurther reading\nThis article does not have any further reading.\n\nExternal

name given to a geographical region to the south of the Sahara, stretching from Western Africa to eastern Central Africa The name derives from the Arabic bilād as-sūdān (بلاد السودان), or the \"Land of the Blacks\" [29] The term was used by Arab traders and travelers in the region to refer to the various indigenous black African cultures and societies that they encountered [30]\n\n\nHistory\nThe Nilotic people of South Sudan—the Dinka, Anyuak, Bari, Acholi, Nuer, Shilluk, Kaligi (Arabic Feroghe), and others—first entered South Sudan sometime before the tenth century, coinciding with the fall of medieval Nubia From the 15th to the 19th century, tribal migrations, largely from the area of Bahr el Ghazal, brought the Anyuak, Dinka, Nuer, and Shilluk to their modern locations in Bahr El Ghazal and the Upper Nile Region, while the Acholi and Bari settled in Equatoria The Zande, Mundu, Avukaya and Baka, who entered South Sudan in the 16th century, established the region's largest state of Equatoria Region [citation needed]\n\n\nIndependence (2011)\nBetween 9 and 15 January 2011, as a consequence of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, the South Sudanese independence referendum was held to determine whether South Sudan should become an independent country, separate from Sudan Following that, 98.83% of those who took part in the referendum voted for separation or independence

familiarity and convenience\" Other names that had been considered were Azania, Nile Republic, Kush Republic and even Juwama, a portmanteau for Juba, Wau and Malakal, three major cities [42] South Sudan formally became independent from Sudan on 9 July, although certain disputes still remained, including the division of oil revenues, as 75% of all the former Sudan's oil reserves are in South Sudan [43] The region of Abyei still remains disputed and a separate referendum will be held in Abyei on whether they want to join Sudan or South Sudan [44] The South Kordofan conflict broke out in June 2011 between the Army of Sudan and the SPLA over the Nuba Mountains.\n\n\nCivil War (2013–2020)\nOn the 5th of September 2013, an article written by analyst Duop Chak Wuol was published by the US-based South Sudan News Agency (SSNA) [56] The writer raised critical questions surrounding what he described as the rise of autocracy within the top leadership of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) and warned of monumental repercussions unless the ruling elites restored the founding principles of the party Duop also berated the ruling party, arguing that the party has replaced its founding principles with \"forgotten promises and deceptions\" In December 2013, a political power struggle broke out between President Kiir and his former deputy Riek Machar, as the president accused Machar and ten others of attempting a coup d'état [57] Fighting broke out, igniting the South Sudanese Civil War Ugandan troops were deployed to fight alongside South Sudanese government forces against the rebels [58] The United Nations has peacekeepers in the country as part of the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) Numerous ceasefires were mediated by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) between the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) and SPLM – in opposition and were subsequently broken A peace agreement was signed in Ethiopia under threat of United Nations sanctions for both sides in August 2015 [59] Machar returned to Juba in 2016 and was appointed vice president [60] Following a second breakout of violence in Juba, Machar was replaced as vice-president [61] and he fled the country [62] as the conflict erupted again Rebel in-fighting has become a major part of the conflict [63] Rivalry among Dinka factions led by the President and Malong Awan has also led to fighting In August 2018, another power-sharing agreement came into effect [64]\n\n\nAdmission into the EAC and planned democratic elections (2016–)\nSouth Sudan acceded to the Treaty of the East Africa Community on 15 April 2016 and became a full member on 15 August 2016 [72] South Sudan, Democratic Republic of Congo and Federal Republic of Somalia are the newest members of the East African Community.\n\n\n2017 famine\nOn 20 February 2017, South Sudan and the United Nations declared a famine in parts of former Unity State, with the warning that it could spread rapidly without further action Over 100,000 people were affected The UN World Food Programme said that 40% of the population of South Sudan, 4.9 million people, need food urgently [75] [76] U.N officials said that President Salva Kiir Mayardit was blocking food deliveries to some areas [77] Furthermore, UNICEF warned that more than 1 million children in South Sudan were subjected to malnutrition [78]\n\n\nGeography\nSouth Sudan lies between latitudes 3° and 13°N, and longitudes 24° and 36°E It is covered in tropical forest, swamps, and grassland The White Nile passes through the

is also the state capital of Central Equatoria and the county seat of the eponymous Juba County, and is the country's largest city However, due to Juba's poor infrastructure and massive urban growth, as well as its lack of centrality within South Sudan, the South Sudanese Government adopted a resolution in February 2011 to study the creation of a new planned city to serve as the seat of government [93] [94] It is planned that the capital city will be changed to the more centrally located Ramciel [95] This proposal is functionally similar to construction projects in Abuja, Nigeria; Brasília, Brazil; and Canberra, Australia; among other modern-era planned national capitals It is unclear how the government will fund the project.\n\n\nStates\n\tPrior to 2015, South Sudan was divided into ten states, which also correspond to three historical regions: Bahr el Ghazal, Equatoria, and Greater Upper Nile region which includes Nuerland:\n\n\n2011–2015\n\tPrior to 2015, South Sudan was divided into ten states, which also correspond to three historical regions: Bahr el Ghazal, Equatoria, and Greater Upper Nile region which includes Nuerland:\n\n\n2015–2020\nIn October 2015, South Sudan's President Salva Kiir issued a decree establishing twenty-eight states in place of the ten constitutionally established states [99] The decree established the new states largely along ethnic lines A number of opposition parties and civil society challenged the constitutionality of this decree and Kiir later resolved to take it to parliament for approval as a constitutional amendment [100] In November the South Sudanese parliament empowered President Kiir to create new states [101]\n\n\n2020–present\nUnder the terms of a peace agreement signed on 22 February 2020, South Sudan is again divided into ten states, with two administrative areas and one area with special administrative status [104] [105]\n\n\nForeign relations\nSince independence, relations with Sudan have been changing Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir first announced, in January 2011, that dual citizenship in the North and the South would be allowed, [80] but upon the independence of South Sudan he retracted the offer He has also suggested an EU-style confederation [106] Essam Sharaf, Prime Minister of Egypt after the 2011 Egyptian Revolution, made his first foreign visit to Khartoum and Juba in the lead-up to South Sudan's secession [107] Israel quickly recognized South Sudan as an independent country, [108] and is host to thousands of refugees from South Sudan, many of whom have finally been granted temporary resident status more than a decade later [109] According to American sources, President Obama officially recognised the new state after Sudan, Egypt, Germany and Kenya were among the first to recognise the country's independence on 8 July 2011 [110] [111] Several states that participated in the international negotiations concluded with a self-determination referendum were also quick to acknowledge the overwhelming result The Rationalist process included Kenya, Uganda, Egypt, Ethiopia, Libya, Eritrea, the United Kingdom and Norway [112] [a]\n\n\nMilitary\nA Defence paper was initiated in 2007 by then Minister for SPLA Affairs Dominic Dim Deng, and a draft was produced in 2008 It declared that Southern Sudan would eventually maintain land, air, and riverine forces [134] [135]\n\n\nHuman rights\nCampaigns of atrocities against civilians have been attributed to the SPLA [137] In the SPLA/M's attempt to disarm rebellions among the Shilluk and Murle, they burned scores of villages, raped hundreds of women and girls and killed an untold number of civilians [138] Civilians alleging torture claim fingernails being torn out, burning plastic bags dripped on children to make their parents hand over weapons, and villagers burned alive in their huts if it was suspected that rebels had spent the night there [138] In May 2011, the SPLA allegedly set fire to over 7,000 homes in Unity State [139]\n\n\nEconomy\nThe economy of South Sudan is one of the world's most underdeveloped, [151] with South Sudan having little existing infrastructure and the highest maternal mortality and female illiteracy rates in the world as of 2011 [update] [152] South Sudan exports timber to the international market The region also contains many natural resources such as petroleum, iron ore, copper, chromium ore, zinc, tungsten, mica, silver, gold, diamonds, hardwoods, limestone and hydropower [153] The country's economy, as in many other developing countries, is heavily dependent on agriculture.\n\n\nOil\nThe oilfields in South Sudan have been significant to the economy since the latter part of the 20th century In 2023, oil constitutes more than 90% of state revenues [151] The country has the third-largest oil reserves in Sub-Saharan Africa [154] However, after South Sudan became an independent nation in July 2011, southern and northern negotiators were not immediately able to reach an agreement on how to split the revenue from these southern oilfields [155]\n\n\nDebt\nIn terms of South Sudan's external debt, Sudan and South Sudan maintain a shared debt of approximately US$38 billion, all of which has accumulated throughout the past five decades [160] Though a small portion of this debt is owed to such international institutions as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (approximately US$5.3 billion according to a 2009 report provided by the Bank of Sudan), the bulk of its debt load is actually owed to numerous foreign actors that have provided the nation with financial loans, including the Paris Club (over US$11 billion) and also non-Paris Club bilateral creditors (over US$13 billion) [161]\n\n\nEast African Community membership\nThe presidents of Kenya and Rwanda invited the Autonomous Government of Southern Sudan to apply for membership to the East African Community upon the independence of South Sudan in 2011, [115] [164] and South Sudan was reportedly an applicant country as of mid-July 2011 [115] [165] Analysts suggested that South Sudan's early efforts to integrate infrastructure, including rail links and oil pipelines, [166] with systems in Kenya and Uganda indicated intention on the part of Juba to pivot away from dependence on Sudan and toward the EAC.\n\n\nSouth Sudan and the Commonwealth of Nations\nSouth Sudan has applied to join the Commonwealth of Nations, [178] considering that South Sudan was part of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, and has two republics in the Commonwealth of Nations, Kenya and Uganda, as neighbouring countries.\n\n\nTransport\nRoad transport is the most common and cheapest means of transport used in the country.\n\n\nRailway\nSouth Sudan has 248 km (154 mi) of single-track 1,067 mm (3 ft 6 in) gauge railway line from the Sudanese border to Wau terminus There are proposed extensions from Wau to Juba There are also plans to link Juba with the Kenyan and Ugandan railway networks.\n\n\nAir\nThe busiest and most developed airport in South Sudan is Juba Airport, which has regular international connections to Asmara, Entebbe, Nairobi, Cairo, Addis Ababa, and Khartoum Juba Airport was also the home base of Feeder Airlines Company and Southern Star Airlines [179]\n\n\nWater crisis\nThe water supply in South Sudan is faced with numerous challenges Although the White Nile runs through the country, water is scarce during the dry season in areas that are not located on the river.\n\n\nDemographics\nSouth Sudan has a population of approximately 11 million [183] [184] and a predominantly rural, subsistence economy This region has been negatively affected by war for all but 10 of the years since 1956, resulting in serious neglect, lack of infrastructure development, and major destruction and displacement More than 2 million people have died, and more than 4 million are internally displaced persons or became refugees as a result of the civil war and its impact.\n\n\nPopulation\nThe \"Fifth Population and Housing Census of Sudan\", for Sudan as a whole, was conducted in April 2008 The census counted the Southern Sudan population at 8.26 million; [185] [186] however, Southern Sudanese officials rejected the census results of Southern Sudan because \"the central bureau of statistics in Khartoum refused to share the national Sudan raw census data with the southern Sudan centre for census, statistics and evaluation\" [187]\n\n\n2008 census\nThe \"Fifth Population and Housing Census of Sudan\", for Sudan as a whole, was conducted

bureau of statistics in Khartoum refused to share the national Sudan raw census data with the southern Sudan centre for census, statistics and evaluation\" [187]\n\n\n2009 census\nIn 2009, Sudan initiated a Southern Sudanese census ahead of the 2011 independence referendum, which would also include the South Sudanese diaspora; however, this initiative was criticised for leaving out countries with a high share of the South Sudanese diaspora, rather counting countries where the diaspora share was low [190]\n\n\nEthnic groups\nThe major ethnic groups present in South Sudan are the Dinka at approximately 40 percent of the population, the Nuer at approximately 20 percent, and the Azande at approximately 10 percent, as well as the Shilluk and Bari [191] Currently, around 800,000 expatriates from the Horn of Africa are living in South Sudan  [citation needed]\n\n\nDiaspora\nThe South Sudanese diaspora consists of citizens of South Sudan residing abroad The number of South Sudanese outside South Sudan has sharply increased since the beginning of the struggle for independence from Sudan Almost one and a half million South Sudanese have left the country as refugees, either permanently or as temporary workforce, leading to the establishment of the South Sudanese diaspora population [citation needed]\n\n\nLargest cities\nThere are 70 languages spoken in South Sudan, of which 60 are indigenous and granted constitutional status as \"national languages\" that \"shall be respected, developed and promoted\" [195] English is the sole official language, [1] being constitutionally enshrined as the \"official working language\" of government and the \"language of instruction at all levels of education\" [196] English had been the principal language of what is now South Sudan since 1972, serving as the common medium for administrative purposes [197] However, few South Sudanese speak it as a first language [198]\n\n\nLanguages\nThere are 70 languages spoken

the South Sudanese include Christianity, [208] various traditional indigenous belief systems, and Islam [209] [210] Exact figures are lacking due to internal displacement from ongoing conflict, large numbers of frequently-migrating pastoralists, and insufficient government resources [211] [212] The last official census to take into account religion was in 1956, where a majority of people were classified as adherents of traditional beliefs or Christianity, while 18% were Muslim [213]\n\n\nEducation\nUnlike the previous educational system of the regional Southern Sudan—which was modelled after the system used in the Republic of Sudan since 1990—the current educational system of the Republic of South Sudan follows the 8 + 4 + 4 system (similar to Kenya) Primary education consists of eight years, followed by four years of secondary education, and then four years of university instruction.\n\n\nHealth and humanitarian situation\nAccording to the United Nations, there are 8.3 million people in need of humanitarian aid in South Sudan as of January 2021 [234] South Sudan is acknowledged to have some of the worst health indicators in the world [235] [236] [237] The under-five infant mortality rate is 135.3 per 1,000, whilst maternal mortality is the highest in the world at 2,053.9 per 100,000 live births [237] In 2004, there were only three surgeons serving in southern Sudan, with three proper hospitals, and in some areas there was just one doctor for every 500,000 people [235]\n\n\nRefugees\nAs of February 2014, South Sudan was host to over 230,000 refugees, with the vast majority, over 209,000, having arrived recently from Sudan, because of the War in Darfur Other African countries that contribute the most refugees to South Sudan are the Central African Republic, Ethiopia, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo [250] As a result of the war that erupted in December 2013, more than 2.3 million people – one in every five people in South Sudan – have been forced to flee their homes, including 1.66 million internally displaced people (with 53.4 per cent estimated to be children) and nearly 644,900 refugees in neighbouring countries Some 185,000 internally displaced people (IDPs) have sought refuge in UN Protection of Civilians (PoC) sites, while around 90 percent of IDPs are on the run or sheltering outside PoC sites [251] Consequently, UNHCR is stepping up its response through an inter-agency collaborative approach under the leadership of the Humanitarian Coordinator, and working with the International Organization for Migration (IOM) In early February 2013, UNHCR started distributing relief items outside the UN base in Malakal, South Sudan, which was expected to reach 10,000 people [250]\n\n\nCulture\nDue to the many years of civil war, South Sudan's culture is heavily influenced by its neighbours Many South Sudanese fled to Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda where they interacted with the nationals and learned their languages and culture Most of those who remained in Sudan until or after independence partially assimilated to Sudanese culture and speak Juba Arabic or Sudanese Arabic.\n\n\nMusic\nMany music artists from South Sudan use English, Swahili, Juba Arabic, their native African language or a mix of all Popular artists like Barbz, Yaba Angelosi, De Peace Child sing Afro-beat, R&B, and Zouk; Dynamq is popular for his reggae releases; and Emmanuel Kembe who sings folk, reggae and Afro-beat [252] Also hip hop artists like Emmanuel Jal, FTG Metro, Flizzame and Dugga Mulla (of FMG) Emmanuel being one of the South Sudaneses music artists who have broken through on an international level [253] with his unique form of hip hop and a positive message in his lyrics [254] Jal, a former child soldier turned musician, received good airplay and album reviews in the UK [255] and has also been sought out for the lecture circuit with major talks at popular talkfests like TED [256]\n\n\nMedia\nWhile former Information Minister Barnaba Marial Benjamin vowed that South Sudan will respect freedom of the press and allow journalists unrestricted access in the country, the chief editor of Juba newspaper The Citizen claimed that in the absence of a formal media law in the fledgling republic, he and his staff have faced abuse at the hands of security forces This alleged fettering of media freedom was attributed in an Al Jazeera report to the difficulty SPLM has faced in reforming itself as a legitimate government after years of leading a rebellion against the Sudanese government The Citizen is South Sudan's largest newspaper, but poor infrastructure and poverty have kept its staff relatively small and limited the efficiency of both its reporting and its circulation outside of Juba, with no dedicated news bureaus in outlying states and newspapers often taking several days to reach states like Northern Bahr el Ghazal [257] In May 2020, South Sudan Friendship Press was established as the country's first dedicated online news website [258]\nNile citizens  is laid out as the nation's committed web-based news site [259]\n\n\nCensorship\nOn 1 November 2011, South Sudan's National Security Services (NSS) arrested the editor of a private Juba-based daily, Destiny, and suspended its activities indefinitely This was in response to an opinion article by columnist Dengdit Ayok, entitled \"Let Me Say So\", which criticized the president for allowing his daughter to marry an Ethiopian national, and accused him of \"staining his patriotism\" An official letter accused the newspaper of

As a result of this run, he reached a career-high ranking of world No 29, on February 11, 2019.\n\n**2020: US Open fourth round**\n\nTiafoe dropped out of the top 50 in February, after losing his quarterfinal points from the 2019 Australian Open when he was defeated in the first round of the 2020 Australian Open by Daniil Medvedev.\n\n**2021: First top-5 win, ATP 500 final**\n\nTiafoe started the year at the Delray Beach Open, where he was beaten by Cameron Norrie in the quarterfinals. He then lost in the second round of the Australian Open and in the first or second rounds of several ATP 250 tournaments. At the Miami Open, he beat top-30 player Dan Evans in a comeback, but lost in the round of 16 to No.1 seed Daniil Medvedev. He did not have good results during the European Clay Swing as he could not qualify for the main draw of the Madrid Masters or the Rome Masters and he lost in the first round of the French Open to Steve Johnson, despite being up two sets to love.\n\n**2022: US Open semifinal, top 20, American No. 2**\n\nTiafoe saw success in the European Clay swing of the season. At the Portugal Open, he defeated Monte-Carlo finalist Alejandro Davidovich Fokina in the quarterfinals and Sebastian Korda in the semifinals. He lost to Sebastián Báez in the final, but reached the top 25 in rankings on May 2, 2022. In his next event, the Madrid Open, Tiafoe lost to Cristian Garín in the first round. Tiafoe, who had played in the French Open six times previously, recorded his first victory at Roland Garros in 2022 with a first-round win over Benjamin Bonzi. In the second round, he lost to David Goffin in four sets. At the Wimbledon Championships, he reached the round of 16 for the first time at this major. He lost again to Goffin this time, in a tight five-set match that lasted 4 hours and 36 minutes.\n\n**2023: United Cup champion, two titles, top 10**\n\nTiafoe started the season at the inaugural United Cup, as the No 2 American male player, where the United States team became champion by defeating Italy in the final.\n\n**Playing style**\n\nLike many of his top-ranked American contemporaries, such as Jack Sock and Sam Querrey, Tiafoe plays an aggressive offensive game that relies on a big serve and powerful forehand. At 6 feet 2 inches tall, Tiafoe can launch serves at over 140 mph, and regularly hits first serves between 120 and 140 mph. After facing him at the 2016 US Open, John Isner said that Tiafoe could return his serve — widely regarded as one of the best in the game — as well as any player on tour outside of Novak Djokovic. He also said that Tiafoe's second serve could use improvement. Tiafoe's most unusual shot is his forehand, which carries heavy topspin and is driven by an unusual arm motion.\n\n**Coaches**\n\nFrom age 8 to 17, Tiafoe was coached at the Junior Tennis Champions Center in Maryland by Misha Kouznetsov, who had played college tennis at UMBC and coached tennis at Robert Morris. Kouznetsov left his job at the JTCC to work with Tiafoe full-time. After Tiafoe moved to Florida to train with the USTA, he was coached by José Higueras from Spain, who had led fellow Americans Michael Chang and Jim Courier to Grand Slam titles. Tiafoe also worked with Nicolás Todero while at USTA. Robby Ginepri, a former US Open semifinalist, began coaching Tiafoe in the fall of 2016. Tiafoe's friend Zack Evenden started to help coach him shortly before he won his first ATP title in 2018. Evenden took over as Tiafoe's primary coach before the start of the 2019 season. In the 2020 season, Tiafoe hired former top-10 player Wayne Ferreira as an additional coach. In July 2021, Tiafoe and Evenden parted ways by mutual agreement, and Ferreira became his primary coach. In December 2023, Tiafoe parted with Ferreira and reunited with former USTA coach Diego Moyano.\n\n**Equipment and apparel**\n\nTiafoe has been sponsored by Nike since May 2016. He was previously sponsored by Adidas. Tiafoe endorses the Yonex PERCEPT 97 tennis racket equipped with Polytour Pro 125 strings. He chose this racket because it helps him \"play more aggressively.\"\n\n**Personal life**\n\nTiafoe is nicknamed \"Big Foe\" or simply \"Foe.\" He made known his relationship with tennis player Ayan Broomfield in 2018.\n\n**Performance timelines**\n\nCurrent through the 2024 Rolex Paris Masters.\n\n**Singles**\n\n* Current ranking: No. 11 (as of March 2024)\n* Highest ranking: No. 11 (as of March

After moving to Globe, Arizona, his family lived in a tent, struggling to make ends meet. Despite the challenges, Dougherty attended Van Nuys High School in Los Angeles, California, where he became the popular, attractive football captain and class president. He graduated high school in 1938, in the same class as actress Jane Russell. Dougherty was offered an athletic scholarship from the University of California at Santa Barbara, but he turned it down.\n\n**1921-1941: Early Life and Education**\n\nAs the fifth and final child of Edward and Ethel Dougherty (née Beatty), natives of Pueblo, Colorado, James Edward \"Jim\" Dougherty was born on April 12, 1921, in Torrance, California. His family moved to Globe, Arizona, where they suffered from the Great Depression, living in a tent.

Around this time, he met 15-year-old Norma Jeane Baker (later known as Marilyn Monroe) at Van Nuys High School. Monroe was living with her foster parents, Dougherty's neighbors named Grace and Doc Goddard, as her mother, Gladys Pearl Baker, had been committed to a sanatorium for paranoid schizophrenia in 1934.

Mayweather Sr., is a former welterweight contender who fought Hall of Famer Sugar Ray Leonard His uncles Jeff and the late Roger Mayweather were professional boxers, with the latter—Floyd's former trainer—winning two world championships, as well as fighting Hall of Famers Julio César Chávez, Pernell Whitaker, and Kostya Tszyu Mayweather was born with his mother's last name, [27] but his last

\"Pretty Boy\" by his amateur teammates because he had relatively few scars, a result of the defensive techniques that his father and uncle (Roger Mayweather) had taught him [38] In his orthodox defensive stance Mayweather often utilizes the shoulder roll, an old-school boxing technique in which the right hand is held normally (or slightly higher than normal), the left hand is down around the midsection and the lead shoulder is raised high on the cheek in order to cover the chin and block punches The right hand (as in the orthodox stance) is used as it normally would be: to block punches coming from the other side, such as left hooks From this stance Mayweather blocks, slips and deflects most of his opponents' punches (even when cornered) by twisting left and right to the rhythm of their punches [39]\n\n\n1996 Olympics\nAt the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, Mayweather won a bronze medal by reaching the semi-finals of the featherweight (57-kg) [40] division.\n\n\nProfessional

champ\" [53]\n\n\nMayweather vs. Corrales\nIn one of the more definitive and memorable fights of his career Mayweather fought the hard-hitting, former IBF super-featherweight champion Diego Corrales

#7 pound-for-pound), while Corrales was the #1-ranked super featherweight in the world and #5 pound-for-pound [59] [71] Before the fight was announced Mayweather had stated he wanted to fight

pay-per-view fight between Mayweather and The Ring #1-ranked contender Arturo Gatti took place June 25, 2005, in Atlantic City, New Jersey, where fans heavily supported Gatti Before the fight Mayweather was confident, describing Gatti as \"a C+ fighter,\" \"a fake\" and \"a blown-up club fighter\" [104] Mayweather entered the ring being carried on a chariot to the song \"Another One Bites the Dust\" [105] Gatti entered the ring accompanied by the song \"Thunderstruck\" and was momentarily frightened by the pyrotechnics exploding Near the end of round one, Mayweather pushed Gatti's head down in close; Gatti broke, leaving himself vulnerable while Mayweather continued landing punches Gatti turned to the referee to complain; Mayweather capitalised, sending Gatti to the canvas with more shots for what was scored a knockdown [106] Throughout the next five rounds, the quicker Mayweather landed nearly every shot against Gatti, who had no offense with which to return fire Gatti's corner

ruled a knockdown But Mayweather began to dominate Judah in round five, and the latter eventually bled Late in the tenth round, Judah hit Mayweather with a left hand that was clearly below the belt, following with a right-handed rabbit punch Referee Richard Steele called time out with five seconds remaining in the round Roger Mayweather entered the ring and approached Judah, but Steele restrained him; Judah's father (and trainer), Yoel Judah, entered the ring as well Mayweather remained in the neutral corner while the Judahs scuffled with Roger (and others who had entered the ring), until

He was nicknamed \"Pretty Boy\" by his amateur teammates because he had relatively few scars, a result of the defensive techniques that his father and uncle (Roger Mayweather) had taught him [38] In his orthodox defensive stance Mayweather often utilizes the shoulder roll, an old-school boxing technique in which the right hand is held normally (or slightly higher than normal), the left hand is down around the midsection and the lead shoulder is raised high on the cheek in order to cover the chin and block punches The right hand (as in the orthodox stance) is used as it normally would be: to block punches coming from the other side, such as left hooks From this stance Mayweather blocks, slips and deflects most of his opponents' punches (even when cornered) by twisting left and right to the rhythm of their punches [39]\n\n\n1996 Olympics\nAt the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, Mayweather won a bronze medal by reaching the semi-finals of the featherweight (57-kg) [40]

{"title": "Louis_Mountbatten,_1st_Earl_Mountbatten_of_Burma", "content": "\nEarly life\nMountbatten, then named Prince Louis of Battenberg, was born on 25 June 1900 at Frogmore House in the Home Park, Windsor, Berkshire [2] He was the youngest child and the second son of Prince Louis of Battenberg and his wife Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine [3] Mountbatten's maternal grandparents were Louis IV, Grand Duke of Hesse, and Princess Alice of the United Kingdom, who was a daughter of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha His paternal grandparents were Prince Alexander of Hesse and by Rhine and Julia, Princess of Battenberg [4] Mountbatten's paternal grandparents' marriage was morganatic because his grandmother was not of royal lineage; as a result, he and his father were styled \"Serene Highness\" rather than \"Grand Ducal Highness\", were not eligible to be titled Princes of Hesse, and were given the less exalted Battenberg title Mountbatten's elder siblings were Princess Alice of Battenberg (mother of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh), Princess Louise of Battenberg (later Queen Louise of Sweden), and Prince George of Battenberg (later George Mountbatten, 2nd Marquess of Milford Haven) [4]\n\n\nFirst World War\nAt the age of 16, Mountbatten was posted as midshipman to the battlecruiser HMS Lion in July 1916 and, after seeing action in August 1916, transferred to the battleship HMS Queen Elizabeth during the closing phases of the First World War [8] In June 1917, when the royal family stopped using their German names and titles and adopted the more British-sounding \"Windsor\", Mountbatten acquired the courtesy title appropriate to a younger son of a marquess, becoming known as Lord Louis Mountbatten (Lord Louis for short) until he was created a peer in his own right in 1946 [11] He paid a visit of ten days to the Western Front in July 1918 [12]\n\n\nInterwar period\nMountbatten was posted to the battlecruiser HMS Renown in March 1920 and accompanied Edward, Prince of Wales, on a royal tour of Australia in her [11] He was promoted lieutenant on 15 April 1920 [16] HMS Renown returned to Portsmouth on 11 October 1920 [17] Early in 1921 Royal Navy personnel were used for civil defence duties as serious industrial unrest seemed imminent Mountbatten had to command a platoon of stokers, many of whom had never handled a rifle before, in Northern England [17] He transferred to the battlecruiser HMS Repulse in March 1921 and accompanied the Prince of Wales on a Royal tour of India and Japan [11] [18] Edward and Mountbatten formed a close friendship during the trip [11] Mountbatten survived the deep defence cuts known as the Geddes Axe Fifty-two percent of the officers of his year had had to leave the Royal Navy by the end of 1923; although he was highly regarded by his superiors, it was rumoured that wealthy and well-connected officers were more likely to be retained [19] Mountbatten was posted to the battleship HMS Revenge in the Mediterranean Fleet in January 1923 [11]\n\n\nSecond World War\nWhen war broke out in September 1939, Mountbatten became Captain (D) (commander) of the 5th Destroyer Flotilla aboard HMS Kelly, which became famous for its exploits [25] In late 1939 he brought the Duke of Windsor back from exile in France and in early May 1940 Mountbatten led a British convoy in through the fog to evacuate the Allied forces participating in the Namsos Campaign during the Norwegian Campaign [28]\n\n\nSEAC and Burma campaign\nIn August 1943, Churchill appointed Mountbatten the Supreme Allied Commander South East Asia Command (SEAC) with promotion to acting full admiral [32] His less practical ideas were sidelined by an experienced planning staff led by Lieutenant-Colonel James Allason, though some, such as a proposal to launch an amphibious assault near Rangoon, got as far as Churchill before being quashed [47]\n\n\nViceroy of India\nMountbatten's experience in the region and in particular his perceived Labour sympathies at that time, alongside his wife's longstanding friendship and collaboration with V K Krishna Menon, led to Menon putting forth Mountbatten's name alone as a viceregal candidate acceptable to the Indian National Congress, in clandestine meetings with Sir Stafford Cripps and Clement Attlee [55] Attlee advised King George VI to appoint Mountbatten Viceroy of India on 20 February 1947 [56] [57] charged with overseeing the transition of British India to independence no later than 30 June 1948 Mountbatten's instructions were to avoid partition and preserve a united India as a result of the transfer of power but authorised him to adapt to a changing situation in order to get Britain out promptly with minimal reputational damage [58] [59]\n\n\nIndependence of India and Pakistan\nWhen India and Pakistan attained independence at midnight of 14–15 August 1947, Mountbatten was alone in his study at the Viceroy's house saying to himself just before the clock struck midnight that for still a few minutes, he was the most powerful man on Earth At 12 am, as a last act of showmanship, he created Joan Falkiner, the Australian wife of the Nawab of Palanpur, a highness, an act that was apparently one of his favourite duties that was annulled at the stroke of midnight [75]\n\n\nGovernor-General of India\nMountbatten became the first Governor-General of independent India on 15 August 1947 upon the request of Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru The Life magazine noted on his reception in India that, \"The people gathered in the streets to cheer Mountbatten as no European had ever been cheered before.\" [84]\n\n\nLater career\nAfter India, Mountbatten served as commander of the 1st Cruiser Squadron in the Mediterranean Fleet and, having been granted the substantive rank of vice-admiral on 22 June 1949, [90] he became Second-in-Command of the Mediterranean Fleet in April 1950 [85] He became Fourth Sea Lord at the Admiralty in June 1950 He then returned to the Mediterranean to serve as Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean Fleet and NATO Commander Allied Forces Mediterranean from June 1952 [85] He was promoted to the substantive rank of full admiral on 27 February 1953 [91] In March 1953, he was appointed Personal Aide-de-Camp to the Queen [92]\n\n\nAlleged plots against Harold Wilson\nPeter Wright, in his 1987 book Spycatcher, claimed that in May 1968 Mountbatten attended a private meeting with press baron Cecil King and the government's Chief Scientific Adviser, Solly Zuckerman Wright alleged that \"up to thirty\" MI5 officers had joined a secret campaign to undermine the crisis-stricken Labour government of Harold Wilson and that King was an MI5 agent In the meeting, King allegedly urged Mountbatten to become the leader of a government of national salvation Solly Zuckerman pointed out that it was \"rank treachery\" and the idea came to nothing because of Mountbatten's reluctance to act [113] In contrast, Andrew Lownie has suggested that it took the intervention of the Queen to dissuade Mountbatten from plotting against Wilson [114]\n\n\nPersonal life\nMountbatten was married on 18 July 1922 to Edwina Cynthia Annette Ashley, daughter of Wilfred William Ashley, later 1st Baron Mount Temple, himself a grandson of the 7th Earl of Shaftesbury She was the favourite granddaughter of the Edwardian magnate Sir Ernest Cassel and the principal heir to his fortune The couple spent heavily on households, luxuries, and entertainment [11] There followed a honeymoon tour of European royal courts and North America which included a visit to Niagara Falls (because \"all honeymooners went there\") [6] During their honeymoon in California, the newlyweds starred in a silent home movie by Charlie Chaplin called Nice And Friendly, which was not shown in cinemas [117] [118]\n\n\nMarriage\nMountbatten was married on 18 July 1922 to Edwina Cynthia Annette Ashley, daughter of Wilfred William Ashley, later 1st Baron Mount Temple, himself a grandson of the 7th Earl of Shaftesbury She was the favourite granddaughter of the Edwardian magnate Sir Ernest Cassel and the principal heir to his fortune The couple spent heavily on households, luxuries, and entertainment [11] There followed a honeymoon tour of European royal courts and North America which included a visit to Niagara Falls (because \"all honeymooners went there\") [6] During their honeymoon in California, the newlyweds starred in a silent home movie by Charlie Chaplin called Nice And Friendly, which was not shown in cinemas [117] [118]\n\n\nSexual allegations\nIn 2019, Ron Perks, Mountbatten's driver in Malta in 1948, alleged that he used to visit the Red House, an upmarket gay brothel in Rabat used by naval officers [124] Andrew Lownie, a fellow of the Royal Historical Society, wrote that the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) maintained files regarding Mountbatten's alleged homosexuality [125] Lownie also interviewed several young men who claimed to have been in a relationship with Mountbatten John Barratt, Mountbatten's personal and private secretary for 20 years, [126] has said Mountbatten was not a homosexual, and that it would have been impossible for such a fact to have been hidden from him [122]\n\n\nDaughter as heir\nLord and Lady Mountbatten had two daughters: Patricia Knatchbull (14 February 1924 – 13 June 2017), [136] sometime lady-in-waiting to Queen Elizabeth II, and Lady Pamela Hicks (born 19 April 1929), who accompanied them to India in 1947–1948 and was also sometime lady-in-waiting to the Queen [4]\n\n\nLeisure interests\nMountbatten was passionate about genealogy, an interest he shared with other European royalty and nobility; according to Ziegler, he spent a great deal of his leisure time in studying his links with European royal houses [139] From 1957 until his death, Lord Mountbatten was Patron of the Cambridge University Heraldic and Genealogical Society [140] He was equally passionate about orders, decorations and military ranks and uniforms, though he considered this interest to be a sign of vanity and constantly tried to distance himself from it, with limited success [141] Over the course of his career, he consistently attempted to secure as many orders and decorations as possible [142] Particular about details of dress, Mountbatten took an interest in fashion design, introducing trouser zips, a tail-coat with broad, high lapels and a \"buttonless waistcoat\" that could be pulled on over the head [143] In 1949, having by then relinquished the office of Governor-General of India but retaining a keen interest in Indian affairs, he designed new flags, insignia, and details of uniforms for the Indian Armed Forces ahead of the transition from British dominion to republic; many of his designs were implemented and remain in use [144]\n\n\nMentorship of King Charles III\nMountbatten was a strong influence in the upbringing of his great-nephew, the future King Charles III, and later as a mentor – \"Honorary Grandfather\" and \"Honorary Grandson\", they fondly called each other according to the Jonathan Dimbleby biography of the then-Prince – though according to both the Ziegler biography of Mountbatten and the Dimbleby biography of the Prince, the results may have been mixed He from time to time strongly upbraided the Prince for showing tendencies towards the idle pleasure-seeking dilettantism of his predecessor as Prince of Wales, King Edward VIII, whom Mountbatten had known well in their youth Yet he also encouraged the Prince to enjoy the bachelor life while he could, and then to marry a young and inexperienced girl so as to ensure a stable married life [148]\n\n\nTelevision appearances\nOn 27 April 1977, shortly before his 77th birthday, Mountbatten became the first member of the Royal Family to appear on the TV guest show This Is Your Life [154] \tIn the UK, 22.22 million people tuned in to watch the programme [155]\n\n\nAssassination\nMountbatten usually holidayed at his summer home, Classiebawn Castle, on the Mullaghmore Peninsula in County Sligo, in the north-west of Ireland The village was only 12 miles (19 km) from the border with County Fermanagh in Northern Ireland and near an area known to be used as a cross-border refuge by IRA members [156] [157] In 1978, the IRA had allegedly attempted to shoot Mountbatten as he was aboard his boat, but poor weather had prevented the sniper taking his shot [158]\n\n\nFuneral\nOn 5 September 1979, Mountbatten received a ceremonial funeral at Westminster Abbey, which was attended by Queen Elizabeth II, the royal family, and members of the European royal houses Watched by thousands of people, the funeral procession, which started at Wellington Barracks, included representatives of all three British Armed Services, and military contingents from Burma, India, the United States (represented by 70 sailors of the US Navy and 50 US Marines [177]), France (represented by the French Navy) and Canada His coffin was drawn on a gun carriage by 118 Royal Navy ratings [178] [179] Mountbatten's funeral was the first major royal funeral to be held in the Abbey since the 18th century [180] During the televised service, his great-nephew Charles read the lesson from Psalm 107 [178] In an address, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Donald Coggan, highlighted his various achievements and his \"lifelong devotion to the Royal Navy\" [181] After the public ceremonies, which he had planned himself, Mountbatten was buried in Romsey Abbey [182] [183] As part of the funeral arrangements, his body had been embalmed by Desmond Henley [184]\n\n\nAftermath\nTwo hours before the bomb detonated, Thomas McMahon had been arrested at a Garda checkpoint between Longford and Granard on suspicion of driving a stolen vehicle He was tried for the assassinations in Ireland and convicted on 23 November 1979 based on forensic evidence supplied by James O'Donovan that showed flecks of paint from the boat and traces of nitroglycerine on his clothes [185] He was released in 1998 under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement [157] [186]\n\n\nLegacy\nMountbatten's faults, according to his biographer Philip Ziegler, like everything else about him, \"were on the grandest scale His vanity though child-like, was monstrous, his ambition unbridled .. He sought to rewrite history with cavalier indifference to the facts to magnify his own achievements.\" [189] However, Ziegler concludes that Mountbatten's virtues outweighed his defects: [189]\n\n\nAwards and decorations\nletters\n\n\nArms\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nWorks cited\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nLouis Francis Albert Victor Nicholas Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma, was a British naval officer and statesman who served as the last Viceroy of India and the first Governor-General of independent India. He was a member of the British royal family and played a significant role in the country's transition to independence. Mountbatten was also a skilled naval officer who served in the Royal Navy during both World War I and World War II.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nMountbatten was born on June 25, 1900, at Frogmore House in the Home Park, Windsor, Berkshire.

Lownie also interviewed several young men who claimed to have been in a relationship with Mountbatten John Barratt, Mountbatten's personal and private secretary for 20 years, has said Mountbatten was not a homosexual, and that it would have been impossible for such a fact to have been hidden from him.\n\n**Daughter as heir**\n\nLord and Lady Mountbatten had two daughters: Patricia Knatchbull (February 14, 1924 – June 13, 2017), sometime lady-in-waiting to Queen Elizabeth II, and Lady Pamela Hicks (born April 19, 1929), who accompanied them to India in 1947-1948 and was also sometime lady-in-waiting to the Queen.\n\n**Leisure interests**\n\nMountbatten was passionate about genealogy, an interest he shared with other European royalty and nobility. From 1957 until his death, Lord Mountbatten was Patron of the Cambridge University Heraldic and Genealogical Society. He was equally passionate about orders, decorations and military ranks and uniforms, though he considered this interest to be a sign of vanity and constantly tried to distance himself from it, with limited success. Over the course of his career, he consistently attempted to secure as many orders and decorations as possible.\n\n**Mentorship of King Charles III**\n\nMountbatten was a strong influence in the upbringing of his great-nephew, the future King Charles III, and later as a mentor – \"Honorary Grandfather\" and \"Honorary Grandson\", they fondly called each other according to the Jonathan Dimbleby biography of the then-Prince – though according to both the Ziegler biography of Mountbatten and the Dimbleby biography of the Prince, the results may have been mixed.\n\n**Television appearances**\n\nOn April 27, 1977, shortly before his 77th birthday, Mountbatten became the first member of the Royal Family to appear on the TV guest show This Is Your Life. In the UK, 22.22 million people tuned in to watch the programme.\n\n**Assassination**\n\nMountbatten usually holidayed at his summer home, Classiebawn Castle, on the Mullaghmore Peninsula in County Sligo, in the north-west of Ireland. The village was only 12 miles from the border with County Fermanagh in Northern Ireland and near an area known to be used as a cross-border refuge by IRA members. In 1978, the IRA had allegedly attempted to shoot Mountbatten as he was aboard his boat, but poor weather had prevented the sniper taking his shot.\n\n**Funeral**\n\nOn September 5, 1979, Mountbatten received a ceremonial funeral at Westminster Abbey, which was attended by Queen Elizabeth II, the royal family, and members of the European royal houses. Watched by thousands of people, the funeral procession, which started at Wellington Barracks, included representatives of all three British Armed Services, and military contingents from Burma, India, the United States (represented by 70 sailors of the US Navy and 50 US Marines), France (represented by the French Navy) and Canada. His coffin was drawn on a gun carriage by 118 Royal Navy ratings.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nTwo hours before the bomb detonated, Thomas McMahon had been arrested at a Garda checkpoint between Longford and Granard on suspicion of driving a stolen vehicle. He was tried for the assassinations in Ireland and convicted on November 23, 1979, based on forensic evidence supplied by James O'Donovan that showed flecks of paint from the boat and traces of nitroglycerine on his clothes. He was released in 1998 under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Louis_Mountbatten,_1st_Earl_Mountbatten_of_Burma\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nMountbatten, then named Prince Louis of Battenberg, was born on 25 June 1900 at Frogmore House in the Home Park, Windsor, Berkshire [2] He was the youngest child and the second son of Prince Louis of Battenberg and his wife Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine [3] Mountbatten's maternal grandparents were Louis IV, Grand Duke of Hesse, and Princess Alice of the United Kingdom, who was a daughter of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha His paternal grandparents were Prince Alexander of Hesse and by Rhine and Julia, Princess of Battenberg [4] Mountbatten's paternal grandparents' marriage was morganatic because his grandmother was not of royal lineage; as a result, he and his father were styled \"Serene Highness\" rather than \"Grand Ducal Highness\", were not eligible to be titled Princes of Hesse, and were given the less exalted Battenberg title Mountbatten's elder siblings were Princess Alice of Battenberg (mother of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh), Princess Louise of Battenberg (later Queen Louise of Sweden), and Prince George of Battenberg (later George Mountbatten, 2nd Marquess of Milford Haven) [4]\n\n\nFirst World War\nAt the age of 16, Mountbatten was posted as midshipman to the battlecruiser HMS Lion in July 1916 and, after seeing action in August 1916, transferred to the battleship HMS Queen Elizabeth during the closing phases of the First World War [8] In June 1917, when the royal family stopped using their German names and titles and adopted the more British-sounding \"Windsor\", Mountbatten acquired the courtesy title appropriate to a younger son of a marquess, becoming known as Lord Louis Mountbatten (Lord Louis for short) until he was created a peer in his own right in 1946 [11] He paid a visit of ten days to the Western Front in July 1918 [12]\n\n\nInterwar period\nMountbatten was posted to the battlecruiser HMS Renown in March 1920 and accompanied Edward, Prince of Wales, on a royal tour of Australia in her [11] He was promoted lieutenant on 15 April 1920 [16] HMS Renown returned to Portsmouth on 11 October 1920 [17] Early in 1921 Royal Navy personnel were used for civil defence duties as serious industrial unrest seemed imminent Mountbatten had to command a platoon of stokers, many of whom had never handled a rifle before, in Northern England [17] He transferred to the battlecruiser HMS Repulse in March 1921 and accompanied the Prince of Wales on a Royal tour of India and Japan [11] [18] Edward and Mountbatten formed a close friendship during the trip [11] Mountbatten survived the deep defence cuts known as the Geddes Axe Fifty-two percent of the officers of his year had had to leave the Royal Navy by the end of 1923; although he was highly regarded by his superiors, it was rumoured that wealthy and well-connected officers were more likely to be retained [19] Mountbatten was posted to the battleship HMS Revenge in the Mediterranean Fleet in January 1923 [11]\n\n\nSecond World War\nWhen war broke out in September 1939, Mountbatten became Captain (D) (commander) of the 5th Destroyer Flotilla aboard HMS Kelly, which became famous for its exploits [25] In late 1939 he brought the Duke of Windsor back from exile in France and in early May 1940 Mountbatten led a British convoy in through the fog to evacuate the Allied forces participating in the Namsos Campaign during the Norwegian Campaign [28]\n\n\nSEAC and Burma campaign\nIn August 1943, Churchill appointed Mountbatten the Supreme Allied Commander South East Asia Command (SEAC) with promotion to acting full admiral [32] His less practical ideas were sidelined by an experienced planning staff led by Lieutenant-Colonel James Allason, though some, such as a proposal to launch an amphibious assault near Rangoon, got as far as Churchill before being quashed [47]\n\n\nViceroy of India\nMountbatten's experience in the region and in particular his perceived Labour sympathies at that time, alongside his wife's longstanding friendship and collaboration with V K Krishna Menon, led to Menon putting forth Mountbatten's name alone as a viceregal candidate acceptable to the Indian National Congress, in clandestine meetings with Sir Stafford Cripps and Clement Attlee [55] Attlee advised King George VI to appoint Mountbatten Viceroy of India on 20 February 1947 [56] [57] charged with overseeing the transition of British India to independence no later than 30 June 1948 Mountbatten's instructions were to avoid partition and preserve a united India as a result of the transfer of power but authorised him to adapt to a changing situation in order to get Britain out promptly with minimal reputational damage [58] [59]\n\n\nIndependence of India and Pakistan\nWhen India and Pakistan attained independence at midnight of 14–15 August 1947, Mountbatten was alone in his study at the Viceroy's house saying to himself just before the clock struck midnight that for still a few minutes, he was the most powerful man on Earth At 12 am, as a last act of showmanship, he created Joan Falkiner, the Australian wife of the Nawab of Palanpur, a highness, an act that was apparently one of his favourite duties that was annulled at the stroke of midnight [75]\n\n\nGovernor-General of India\nMountbatten became the first Governor-General of independent India on 15 August 1947 upon the request of Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru The Life magazine noted on his reception in India that, \"The people gathered in the streets to cheer Mountbatten as no European had ever been cheered before.\" [84]\n\n\nLater career\nAfter India, Mountbatten served as commander of the 1st Cruiser Squadron in the Mediterranean Fleet and, having been granted the substantive rank of vice-admiral on 22 June 1949, [90] he became Second-in-Command of the Mediterranean Fleet in April 1950 [85] He became Fourth Sea Lord at the Admiralty in June 1950 He then returned to the Mediterranean to serve as Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean Fleet and NATO Commander Allied Forces Mediterranean from June 1952 [85] He was promoted to the substantive rank of full admiral on 27 February 1953 [91] In March 1953, he was appointed Personal Aide-de-Camp to the Queen [92]\n\n\nAlleged plots against Harold Wilson\nPeter Wright, in his 1987 book Spycatcher, claimed that in May 1968 Mountbatten attended a private meeting with press baron Cecil King and the government's Chief Scientific Adviser, Solly Zuckerman Wright alleged that \"up to thirty\" MI5 officers had joined a secret campaign to undermine the crisis-stricken Labour government of Harold Wilson and that King was an MI5 agent In the meeting, King allegedly urged Mountbatten to become the leader of a government of national salvation Solly Zuckerman pointed out that it was \"rank treachery\" and the idea came to nothing because of Mountbatten's reluctance to act [113] In contrast, Andrew Lownie has suggested that it took the intervention of the Queen to dissuade Mountbatten from plotting against Wilson [114]\n\n\nPersonal life\nMountbatten was married on 18 July 1922 to Edwina Cynthia Annette Ashley, daughter of Wilfred William Ashley, later 1st Baron Mount Temple, himself a grandson of the 7th Earl of Shaftesbury She was the favourite granddaughter of the Edwardian magnate Sir Ernest Cassel and the principal heir to his fortune The couple spent heavily on households, luxuries, and entertainment [11] There followed a honeymoon tour of European royal courts and North America which included a visit to Niagara Falls (because \"all honeymooners went there\") [6] During their honeymoon in California, the newlyweds starred in a silent home movie by Charlie Chaplin called Nice And Friendly, which was not shown in cinemas [117] [118]\n\n\nMarriage\nMountbatten was married on 18 July 1922 to Edwina Cynthia Annette Ashley, daughter of Wilfred William Ashley, later 1st Baron Mount Temple, himself a grandson of the 7th Earl of Shaftesbury She was the favourite granddaughter of the Edwardian magnate Sir Ernest Cassel and the principal heir to his fortune The

honeymooners went there\") [6] During their honeymoon in California, the newlyweds starred in a silent home movie by Charlie Chaplin called Nice And Friendly, which was not shown in cinemas [117] [118]\n\n\nSexual allegations\nIn 2019, Ron Perks, Mountbatten's driver in Malta in 1948, alleged that he used to visit the Red House, an upmarket gay brothel in Rabat used by naval officers [124] Andrew Lownie, a fellow of the Royal Historical Society, wrote that the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) maintained files regarding Mountbatten's alleged homosexuality [125] Lownie also interviewed several young men who claimed to have been in a relationship with Mountbatten John Barratt, Mountbatten's personal and private secretary for 20 years, [126] has said Mountbatten was not a homosexual, and that it would have been impossible for such a fact to have been hidden from him [122]\n\n\nDaughter as heir\nLord and Lady Mountbatten had two daughters: Patricia Knatchbull (14 February 1924 – 13 June 2017), [136] sometime lady-in-waiting to Queen Elizabeth II, and Lady Pamela Hicks (born 19 April 1929), who accompanied them to India in 1947–1948 and was also sometime lady-in-waiting to the Queen [4]\n\n\nLeisure interests\nMountbatten was passionate about genealogy, an interest he shared with other European royalty and nobility; according to Ziegler, he spent a great deal of his leisure time in studying his links with European royal houses [139] From 1957 until his death, Lord Mountbatten was Patron of the Cambridge University Heraldic and Genealogical Society [140] He was equally passionate about orders, decorations and military ranks and uniforms, though he considered this interest to be a sign of vanity and constantly tried to distance himself from it, with limited success [141] Over the course of his career, he consistently attempted to secure as many orders and decorations as possible [142] Particular about details of dress, Mountbatten took an interest in fashion design, introducing trouser zips, a tail-coat with broad, high lapels and a \"buttonless waistcoat\" that could be pulled on over the head [143] In 1949, having by then relinquished the office of Governor-General of India but retaining a keen interest in Indian affairs, he designed new flags, insignia, and details of uniforms for the Indian Armed Forces ahead of the transition from British dominion to republic; many of his designs were implemented and remain in use [144]\n\n\nMentorship of King Charles III\nMountbatten was a strong influence in the upbringing of his great-nephew, the future King Charles III, and later as a mentor – \"Honorary Grandfather\" and \"Honorary Grandson\", they fondly called each other according to the Jonathan Dimbleby biography of the then-Prince – though according to both the Ziegler biography of Mountbatten and the Dimbleby biography of the Prince, the results may have been mixed He from time to time strongly upbraided the Prince for showing tendencies towards the idle pleasure-seeking dilettantism of his predecessor as Prince of Wales, King Edward VIII, whom Mountbatten had known well in their youth Yet he also encouraged the Prince to enjoy the bachelor life while he could, and then to marry a young and inexperienced girl so as to ensure a stable married life [148]\n\n\nTelevision appearances\nOn 27 April 1977, shortly before his 77th birthday, Mountbatten became the first member of the Royal Family to appear on the TV guest show This Is Your Life [154] \tIn the UK, 22.22 million people tuned in to watch the programme [155]\n\n\nAssassination\nMountbatten usually holidayed at his summer home, Classiebawn Castle, on the Mullaghmore Peninsula in County Sligo, in the north-west of Ireland The village was only 12 miles (19 km) from the border with County Fermanagh in Northern Ireland and near an area known to be used as a cross-border refuge by IRA members [156] [157] In 1978, the IRA had allegedly attempted to shoot Mountbatten as he was aboard his boat, but poor weather had prevented the sniper taking his shot [158]\n\n\nFuneral\nOn 5 September 1979, Mountbatten received a ceremonial funeral at Westminster Abbey, which was attended by Queen Elizabeth II, the royal family, and members of the European royal houses Watched by thousands of people, the funeral procession, which started at Wellington Barracks, included representatives of all three British Armed Services, and military contingents from Burma, India, the United States (represented by 70 sailors of the US Navy and 50 US Marines [177]), France (represented by the French Navy) and Canada His coffin was drawn on a gun carriage by 118 Royal Navy ratings [178] [179] Mountbatten's funeral was the first major royal funeral to be held in the Abbey since the 18th century [180] During the televised service, his great-nephew Charles read the lesson from Psalm 107 [178] In an address, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Donald Coggan, highlighted his various achievements and his \"lifelong devotion to the Royal Navy\" [181] After the public ceremonies, which he had planned himself, Mountbatten was buried in Romsey Abbey [182] [183] As part of the funeral arrangements, his body had been embalmed by Desmond Henley [184]\n\n\nAftermath\nTwo hours before the bomb detonated, Thomas McMahon had been arrested at a Garda checkpoint between Longford and Granard on suspicion of driving a stolen vehicle He was tried for the assassinations in Ireland and convicted on 23 November 1979 based on forensic evidence supplied by James O'Donovan that showed flecks of paint from the boat and traces of nitroglycerine on his clothes [185] He was released in 1998 under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement [157] [186]\n\n\nLegacy\nMountbatten's faults, according to his biographer Philip Ziegler, like everything else about him, \"were on the grandest scale His vanity though child-like, was monstrous, his ambition unbridled .. He sought to rewrite history with cavalier indifference to the facts to magnify his own achievements.\" [189] However, Ziegler concludes that Mountbatten's virtues outweighed his defects: [189]\n\n\nAwards and decorations\nletters\n\n\nArms\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nWorks cited\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

This play is a dark comedy that tells the story of a writer who is forced to write children's stories for a totalitarian regime.\n\n**Film**\n\nMcDonagh has stated that he prefers writing films to plays, as he holds a \"respect for the whole history of films and a slight disrespect for theatre.\" In 2004, he wrote and directed the short film Six Shooter, which won an Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film.

Born on December 27, 1999, in Queen Creek, Arizona, Purdy has established himself as a talented quarterback with a strong work ethic and dedication to his craft.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nPurdy's early life was marked by a passion for sports, particularly football. He began playing quarterback in a flag football league as a youth, where he developed the ability to quickly process information and make decisions under pressure. This experience would later contribute to his success as a quarterback in college and the NFL. Purdy's father, Shawn, was a Minor League Baseball player for eight seasons, and his older sister, Whittney, played softball at Southeastern University. His younger brother, Chubba, would later become a dual-threat quarterback at Florida State.\n\n**College Career**\n\nPurdy entered his freshman year at Iowa State University in 2018 as the third-string quarterback behind Kyle Kempt and Zeb Noland. However, after Kempt suffered an injury and Noland was ineffective, Purdy became the starter. He went on to start eight games, completing 146-of-220 passes for 2,250 yards, 16 touchdowns, and seven interceptions, with a career-best passer rating of 169.9. In addition to his passing numbers, Purdy also rushed for 308 yards and five touchdowns. His impressive performance led to a 7-2 record for the Cyclones.\n\n**College Statistics**\n\n| Season | Games | Completions | Attempts | Completion Percentage | Passing Yards | Touchdowns | Interceptions | Passer Rating |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2018 | 8 | 146 | 220 | 66.4% | 2,250 | 16 | 7 | 169.9 |\n| 2019 | 12 | 229 | 362 | 63.3% | 2,665 | 15 | 8 | 144.9 |\n| 2020 | 9 | 147 | 223 | 65.9% | 1,830 | 10 | 8 | 146.9 |\n\n**Professional Career**\n\nIn the 2022 NFL draft, the San Francisco 49ers selected Purdy with the final pick, making him that year's Mr. Irrelevant. Despite being undrafted by another team, Purdy's scouting report praised his experience and ability to work through his progressions. However, it also noted his limited athleticism and arm strength. After observing Purdy's performance in his first NFL season, the coach who authored the report acknowledged that he had undervalued Purdy's agility and mental side.\n\n**2022**\n\nPurdy's rookie season was marked by a strong performance, particularly in the final weeks of the season. He became the 49ers' starter due to injuries to other quarterbacks, and his play earned him a spot on the team's active roster.\n\n**2023**\n\nAfter a successful recovery from injury, Purdy was named the starting quarterback to begin the 2023 season. He faced competition from Sam Darnold, Brandon Allen, and Trey Lance, who was later traded to the Dallas Cowboys.\n\n**2024**\n\nIn Week 5 against the Arizona Cardinals, Purdy made his 50th career touchdown pass, passing to tight end George Kittle. He also became the fastest quarterback in 49ers franchise history to achieve 50 career touchdown passes.\n\n**NFL Career Statistics**\n\n| Season | Games | Completions | Attempts | Completion Percentage | Passing Yards | Touchdowns | Interceptions | Passer Rating |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2022 | 15 | 213 | 326 | 65.3% | 2,575 | 13 | 8 | 91.1 |\n| 2023 | 12 | 246 | 363 | 67.8% | 3,125 | 18 | 9 | 97.1 |\n| 2024 | 5 | 73 | 106 | 68.9% | 935 | 6 | 2 | 102.3 |\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nPurdy is a devout Christian and openly talks about his faith.

\"Bans Off Our Bodies\" Day of Action. The marches were organized in response to the United States Supreme Court's leaked draft opinion in the case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, which suggested that the court would overturn the landmark decision in Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion nationwide.\n\nThe marches were held in over 450 locations across the United States and in more than 30 countries worldwide. The events were organized by local groups and individuals, and were designed to raise awareness about the importance of reproductive rights and to advocate for the protection of access to abortion.\n\nThe marches were largely peaceful, although some events were disrupted by counter-protesters. The events were also notable for the turnout, with many locations reporting large crowds and enthusiastic participation.\n\nThe 2022 Women's March was a significant event in the global movement for reproductive rights, and highlighted the importance of mobilizing around this issue. The event also highlighted the need for continued advocacy and activism to protect access to abortion and to ensure that women's rights are respected and protected.\n\n## References\n\nThis article does not include any references.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"List_of_2022_Women's_March_locations\" following this outline:\n\n\nUnited States\nListed below are over 450 events that took place in the U.S on the weekend of May 14 (with a few happening before or after, as noted)\n\n\nWorldwide\nListed below are marches outside the United States in support of the 2022 \"Bans Off Our Bodies\" Day of Action.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

woman from southern Afghanistan [33] At her house in Mingora, she lived with her two younger brothers, Khushal and Atal, her parents, Ziauddin and Tor Pekai, and two chickens [5]\n\n\nAs a BBC blogger\nIn late 2008, Aamer Ahmed Khan of the BBC Urdu website and his colleagues came up with a novel way of covering the Pakistani Taliban's growing influence in Swat They decided to ask a schoolgirl to blog anonymously about her life there Their correspondent in Peshawar, Abdul Hai Kakar, had been in touch with a local school teacher, Ziauddin Yousafzai, but could not find any students willing to report, as their families considered it too dangerous Finally, Yousafzai suggested his own daughter, 11-year-old Malala [40] At the time, Pakistani Taliban militants led by Maulana Fazlullah were taking over the Swat Valley, banning television, music, girls' education, [41] and women from going shopping [42] Bodies of beheaded policemen were being displayed in town squares [41] At first, a girl named Aisha from her father's school agreed to write a diary, but her parents stopped her from doing it because they feared Taliban reprisals The only alternative was Yousafzai, who was four years younger and in seventh grade at the time [43] \"We had been covering the violence and politics in Swat in detail but we didn't know much about how ordinary people lived under the Taliban\", said Mirza Waheed, former editor of BBC Urdu Because they were concerned for Yousafzai's safety, the BBC editors insisted she use a pseudonym [41] Her blog was published under the byline \"Gul Makai\" (\"cornflower\" in Pashto), a name taken from a character in a Pashtun folktale [44] [41] [45] [46]\n\n\nBanned from school\nFollowing the edict, the Pakistani Taliban destroyed several more local schools On 24 January 2009, Yousafzai wrote: \"Our annual exams are due after the vacations but this will only be possible if the Pakistani Taliban allow girls to go to school We were told to prepare certain chapters for the exam but I do not feel like studying.\" [47]\n\n\nGirls' schools reopen\nOn 25 February, Yousafzai wrote on her blog that she and her classmates \"played a lot in class and enjoyed ourselves like we used to before.\" [47] Attendance at Yousafzai's class was up to 19 of 27 pupils by 1 March, but the Pakistani Taliban were still active in the area Shelling continued, and relief goods meant for displaced people were looted [47] Only two days later, Yousafzai wrote that there was a skirmish between the military and Taliban, and the sounds of mortar shells could be heard: \"People are again scared that the peace may not last for long Some people are saying that the peace agreement is not permanent, it is just a break in fighting.\" [47]\n\n\nAs a displaced person\nAfter the BBC diary ended, Yousafzai and her father were approached by New York Times reporter Adam B Ellick about filming a documentary [43] In May, the Pakistani Army moved into the region to regain control during the Second Battle of Swat (also known as Operation Rah-e-Rast) Mingora was evacuated and Yousafzai's family was displaced and separated Her father went to Peshawar to protest and lobby for support, while she was sent into the countryside to live with relatives \"I'm really bored because I have no books to read,\" she is filmed saying in the documentary [5]\n\n\nEarly activism\nFollowing the documentary, Yousafzai was interviewed on the national Pashto-language station AVT Khyber, the Urdu-language Daily Aaj, and Canada's Toronto Star [43] She made a second appearance on Capital Talk on 19 August 2009 [50] Her BBC blogging identity was being revealed in articles by December 2009 [51] [52] She also began appearing on television to publicly advocate for female education [42] From 2009 to 2010 she was the chair of the District Child Assembly of the Khpal Kor Foundation [53] [54]\n\n\nMurder attempt\nAs Yousafzai became more recognised, the dangers facing her increased Death threats against her were published in newspapers and slipped under her door [63] On Facebook, where she was an active user, she began to receive threats [41] Eventually, a Pakistani Taliban spokesman said they were \"forced\" to act In a meeting held in the summer of 2012, Taliban leaders unanimously agreed to kill her [63]\n\n\nMedical treatment\nAfter the shooting, Yousafzai was airlifted to a military hospital in Peshawar, where doctors were forced to operate after swelling developed in the left portion of her brain, which had been damaged by the bullet when it passed through her head [67] After a five-hour operation, doctors successfully removed the bullet, which had lodged in her shoulder near her spinal cord The day following the attack, doctors performed a decompressive craniectomy, in which part of her skull was removed to allow room for swelling [68]\n\n\nReaction\nThe murder attempt received worldwide media coverage and produced an outpouring of sympathy and anger Protests against the shooting were held in several Pakistani cities the day after the attack, and over 2 million people signed the Right to Education campaign's petition, which led to ratification [83] [84] of the first Right to Education Bill in Pakistan [85] Pakistani officials offered a 10 million rupee (≈US$105,000) reward for information leading to the arrest of the attackers Responding to concerns about his safety, Yousafzai's father said: \"We wouldn't leave our country if my daughter survives or not We have an ideology that advocates peace The Taliban cannot stop all independent voices through the force of bullets.\" [71]\n\n\nUnited Nations petition\nOn 15 October 2012, UN Special Envoy for Global Education, Gordon Brown, the former British Prime

Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE) [120] [121]\n\n\nContinuing activism\nTraditions are not sent from heaven, they are not sent from God It is we who make cultures and we have the right to change it and we should change it.\n\n\nRepresentation\nFormer British Prime Minister Gordon Brown arranged for Yousafzai's appearance before the United Nations in July 2013 [106] Brown also requested that McKinsey consultant Shiza Shahid, a friend of the Yousafzai family, chair Yousafzai's charity fund, which had gained the support of Angelina Jolie [106] Google's vice-president Megan Smith also sits on the fund's board [148]\n\n\nMalala Day\nOn 12 July 2013, Yousafzai's 16th birthday, she spoke at the UN to call for worldwide access to education The UN dubbed the event \"Malala Day\" [129]

My Next Guest Needs No Introduction Speaking about the Taliban, she opined that their misogyny comes from a superiority complex, and is reinforced by finding \"excuses\" in culture or literature, such as by misinterpreting teachings of Islam [173] On the topic of her attackers, Yousafzai comments: \"I forgive them because that's the best revenge I can have.\" Pointing out that the person who

\"failing state government,\" [187] and a journalist in The Nation wrote Yousafzai was hated by \"overzealous patriots\" who were keen to deny the oppression of women in Pakistan [188] Her statements conflicted with the view that militancy in Pakistan was a result of Western interference, [154] and conservatives and Islamic fundamentalists described her ideology as \"anti-Pakistan\" [189] [190]\n\n\nCriticism\nOn 7 August 2019, following the Indian revocation of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, Yousafzai urged the UN to help Kashmiri children go safely back to school in

for The Guardian called the book \"fearless\" and stated that \"the haters and conspiracy theorists would do well to read this book\", though she criticised \"the stiff, know-it-all voice of a foreign correspondent\" that is interwoven with Yousafzai's [209] Marie Arana for The Washington Post called the book \"riveting\" and wrote \"It is difficult to imagine a chronicle of a war more moving, apart from perhaps the diary of Anne Frank.\" [210] Tina Jordan in Entertainment Weekly gave the book a \"B+\", writing \"Malala's bravely eager voice can seem a little thin here, in I Am Malala, likely thanks to her co-writer, but her powerful message remains undiluted.\" [211]\n\n\nAwards and honours\nNational and international honours, listed by the date:\n\n\nIn popular culture\nIn the

activist for female education and the youngest Nobel Prize laureate. She is known for her advocacy of girls' education and her resistance to the Taliban's efforts to deny women and girls the right to education.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nMalala Yousafzai was born on July 12, 1997, in the Swat District of Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. She was the daughter of Ziauddin Yousafzai and Toor Pekai Yousafzai, a teacher and a school owner, respectively. Her family is Sunni Muslim and belongs to the Yusufzai tribe, a Pashtun ethnic group. Malala was given her first name, which means \"grief-stricken,\" after Malalai of Maiwand, a famous Pashtun poet and warrior woman from southern Afghanistan.\n\nMalala lived with her parents and two younger brothers, Khushal and Atal, in a small house in Mingora, Swat. Her early life was marked by the growing influence of the Pakistani Taliban, who were taking over the Swat Valley and imposing their version of Islamic law. Malala's father, a vocal critic of the Taliban, was forced to close his school, and Malala was barred from attending school due to the Taliban's ban on girls' education.\n\n**Childhood**\n\nAs the Taliban's grip on the Swat Valley tightened, Malala became increasingly aware of the importance of education and the role she could play in promoting it. In 2008, at the age of 11, Malala was approached by a BBC journalist, Aamer Ahmed Khan, who was looking for a schoolgirl to blog about her life under the Taliban. Malala's father suggested his daughter, and she began writing a diary for the BBC Urdu website under the pseudonym \"Gul Makai.\"\n\nMalala's blog provided a unique perspective on life under the Taliban, describing the fear and uncertainty that gripped the Swat Valley. She wrote about the Taliban's edicts, including the ban on girls' education, and the impact it had on her and her friends. Malala's blog also highlighted the resilience and determination of the people of Swat, who continued to resist the Taliban's efforts to impose their version of Islamic law.\n\n**As a Displaced Person**\n\nIn 2009, the Pakistani Army launched a military operation to retake the Swat Valley from the Taliban. Malala's family was forced to flee their home, and Malala was sent to live with relatives in the countryside. Her father went to Peshawar to protest and lobby for support, while Malala was left to navigate the challenges of displacement and uncertainty.\n\nMalala's experience as a displaced person had a profound impact on her life and her advocacy. She began to speak out publicly about the importance of education and the need for girls to have access to it. Malala's message resonated with people around the world, and she became a symbol of resistance against the Taliban's efforts to deny women and girls the right to education.\n\n**Early

with a novel way of covering the Pakistani Taliban's growing influence in Swat They decided to ask a schoolgirl to blog anonymously about her life there Their correspondent in Peshawar, Abdul Hai Kakar, had been in touch with a local school teacher, Ziauddin Yousafzai, but could not find any students willing to report, as their families considered it too dangerous Finally, Yousafzai suggested his own daughter, 11-year-old Malala [40] At the time, Pakistani Taliban militants led by Maulana Fazlullah were taking over the Swat Valley, banning television, music, girls' education, [41] and women from going shopping [42] Bodies of beheaded policemen were being displayed in town squares [41] At first, a girl named Aisha from her father's school agreed to write a diary, but her parents stopped her from doing it because they feared Taliban reprisals The only alternative was Yousafzai, who was four years younger and in seventh grade at the time [43] \"We had been covering the violence and politics in Swat in detail but we didn't know much about how ordinary people lived under the Taliban\", said Mirza Waheed, former editor of BBC Urdu Because they were concerned for Yousafzai's safety, the BBC editors insisted she use a pseudonym [41] Her blog was published under the byline \"Gul Makai\" (\"cornflower\" in Pashto), a name taken from a character in a Pashtun folktale [44] [41] [45] [46]\n\n\nBanned from school\nFollowing the edict, the Pakistani Taliban destroyed several more local schools On 24 January 2009, Yousafzai wrote: \"Our annual exams are due after the vacations but this will only be possible if the Pakistani Taliban allow girls to go to school We were told to prepare certain chapters for the exam but I do not feel like studying.\" [47]\n\n\nGirls' schools reopen\nOn 25 February, Yousafzai wrote on her blog that she and her classmates \"played a lot in class and enjoyed ourselves like we used to before.\" [47] Attendance at Yousafzai's class was up to 19 of 27 pupils by 1 March, but the Pakistani Taliban were still active in the area Shelling continued, and relief goods meant for displaced people were looted [47] Only two days later, Yousafzai wrote that there was a skirmish between the military and Taliban, and the sounds of mortar shells could be heard: \"People are again scared that the peace may not last for long Some people are saying that the peace agreement is not permanent, it is just a break in fighting.\" [47]\n\n\nAs a displaced person\nAfter the BBC diary ended, Yousafzai and her father were approached by New York Times reporter Adam B Ellick about filming a documentary [43] In May, the Pakistani Army moved into the region to regain control during the Second Battle of Swat (also known as Operation Rah-e-Rast) Mingora was evacuated and Yousafzai's family was displaced and separated Her father went to Peshawar to protest and lobby for support, while she was sent into the countryside to live with relatives

of the Khpal Kor Foundation [53] [54]\n\n\nMurder attempt\nAs Yousafzai became more recognised, the dangers facing her increased Death threats against her were published in newspapers and slipped under her door [63] On Facebook, where she was an active user, she began to receive threats [41] Eventually, a Pakistani Taliban spokesman said they were \"forced\" to act In a meeting held in the summer of 2012, Taliban leaders unanimously agreed to kill her [63]\n\n\nMedical treatment\nAfter the shooting, Yousafzai was airlifted to a military hospital in Peshawar, where doctors were forced to operate after swelling developed in the left portion of her brain, which had been damaged by the bullet when it passed through her head [67] After a five-hour operation, doctors successfully removed the bullet, which had lodged in her shoulder near her spinal cord The day following the attack, doctors performed a decompressive craniectomy, in which part of her skull was removed to allow room for swelling [68]\n\n\nReaction\nThe murder attempt received worldwide media coverage and produced an outpouring of sympathy and anger Protests against the shooting were held in several Pakistani cities the day after the attack, and over 2 million people signed the Right to Education campaign's petition, which led to ratification [83] [84] of the first Right to Education Bill in Pakistan [85] Pakistani officials offered a 10 million rupee (≈US$105,000) reward for information leading to the arrest of the attackers Responding to concerns about his safety, Yousafzai's father said: \"We

After amassing a three-fight win streak, Nunes earned her first title shot in the UFC. She faced Miesha Tate for the UFC Women's Bantamweight Championship on July 9, 2016, at UFC 200, where she stunned Tate early on with knees and punches and then won the fight by submission (rear-naked choke) in the first round. Her victory made her the first openly gay UFC champion.\n\nBantamweight and Featherweight Champion\n-----------------------------------------\n\nAfter winning the bantamweight title, Nunes moved up to featherweight and won the title by defeating Cris Cyborg at UFC 232 on December 29, 2018. She became the first woman to hold titles in two weight classes simultaneously. Nunes successfully defended her bantamweight title multiple times and then successfully defended her featherweight title against Felicia Spencer at UFC 250 on June 6, 2020.\n\nRetirement\n----------\n\nA trilogy bout was scheduled against Julianna Peña on June 10, 2023, at UFC 289. On May 2, 2023, it was announced that Peña had suffered broken ribs during training camp and would be unable to compete. Irene Aldana agreed to replace Peña at the event. Nunes won the fight via a dominant unanimous decision, and announced her retirement from active competition during the post-fight interview.\n\nPersonal Life\n-------------\n\nNunes is the first openly lesbian UFC champion. She is married to former UFC fighter Nina Nunes (née Ansaroff), who competed in the strawweight division. She credits her UFC success to their relationship.

The castle has a rich history dating back to the 11th century, and has been a favorite residence of many British monarchs over the centuries. Today, Windsor Castle is still a popular tourist destination and a working royal palace, hosting various events and ceremonies throughout the year.\n\n**Architecture**\n\nWindsor Castle grounds cover 13 acres (5.3 hectares) and combine the features of a fortification, a palace, and a small town. The present-day castle was created during a sequence of phased building projects, culminating in the reconstruction work after a fire in 1992. It is in essence a Georgian and Victorian design based on a medieval structure, with Gothic features reinvented in a modern style. Since the 14th century, architecture at the castle has attempted to produce a contemporary reinterpretation of older fashions and traditions, repeatedly imitating outmoded or even antiquated styles. As a result, architect Sir William Whitfield has pointed to Windsor Castle's architecture as having \"a certain fictive quality,\" the Picturesque and Gothic design generating \"a sense that a theatrical performance is being put on here,\" despite late 20th-century efforts to expose more of the older structures to increase the sense of authenticity. Although there has been some criticism, the castle's architecture and history lend it a \"place amongst the greatest European palaces.\"\n\n**Middle Ward**\n\nAt the heart of Windsor Castle is the Middle Ward, a bailey formed around the motte or artificial hill in the centre of the ward. The motte is 50 feet (15 m) high and is made from chalk originally excavated from the surrounding ditch. The keep, called the Round Tower, on the top of the motte is based on an original 12th-century building, extended upwards in the early 19th century under architect Jeffry Wyatville by 30 feet (9.1 m) to produce a more imposing height and silhouette. The interior of the Round Tower was further redesigned in 1991-1993 to provide additional space for the Royal Archives, an additional room being built in the space left by Wyatville's originally hollow extension. The Round Tower is in reality far from cylindrical, due to the shape and structure of the motte beneath it. The current height of the tower has been criticized as being disproportionate to its width; archaeologist Tim Tatton-Brown, for example, has described it as a mutilation of the earlier medieval structure.\n\n**Upper Ward**\n\nThe Upper Ward of Windsor Castle comprises a number of major buildings enclosed by the upper bailey wall, forming a central quadrangle. The State Apartments run along the north of the ward, with a range of buildings along the east wall, and the private royal apartments and the King George IV Gate to the south, with the Edward III Tower in the south-west corner. The motte and the Round Tower form the west edge of the ward. A bronze statue of Charles II on horseback sits beneath the Round Tower, inspired by Hubert Le Sueur's statue of Charles I in London, the statue was cast by Josias Ibach in 1679, with the marble plinth featuring carvings by Grinling Gibbons. The Upper Ward adjoins the North Terrace, which overlooks the River Thames, and the East Terrace, which overlooks the Home Park; both of the current terraces were constructed by Hugh May in the 17th century. The East Terrace has a private formal rose garden, first laid out by George IV in the 1820s. The present garden was updated by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, after it was used for victory garden production during World War II, tended in part by Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret. In 2020, it was announced that for a limited time, the garden would be open to the public for the first time in 40 years.\n\n**State Apartments**\n\nThe State Apartments form the major part of the Upper Ward and lie along the north side of the quadrangle. The modern building follows the medieval foundations laid down by Edward III, with the ground floor comprising service chambers and cellars, and the much grander first floor forming the main part of the palace. On the first floor, the layout of the western end of the State Apartments is primarily the work of architect Hugh May, whereas the structure on the eastern side represents Jeffry Wyatville's plans.\n\n**Lower Ward**\n\nThe Lower Ward lies below and to the west of the Round Tower, reached through the Norman Gate. Originally largely of medieval design, most of the Lower Ward was renovated or reconstructed during the mid-Victorian period by Anthony Salvin and Edward Blore, to form a \"consistently Gothic composition.\" The Lower Ward holds St George's Chapel and most of the buildings associated with the Order of the Garter.\n\n**Park and landscape**\n\nWindsor Castle's position on top of steep ground has meant that the castle's gardens are limited in scale. The castle gardens stretch east from the Upper Ward across a 19th-century terrace. Windsor Castle is surrounded by extensive parkland. The immediate area stretching to the east of the castle is a 19th-century creation known as the Home Park. The Home Park includes parkland and two working farms, along with many estate cottages mainly occupied by employees and the Frogmore estate. The Long Walk, a double-lined avenue of trees, runs for 2.65 miles (4.26 km) south of the castle, and is 240 ft (73 m) wide. The original 17th-century elms were replaced with alternating chestnut and plane trees. The impact of Dutch elm disease led to large-scale replanting after 1945.\n\n**History**\n\nWindsor Castle was originally built by William the Conqueror in the decade after the Norman conquest of 1066. William established a defensive ring of motte and bailey castles around London; each was a day's march—about 20 miles (32 km)—from the City and from the next castle, allowing for easy reinforcements in a crisis. Windsor Castle, one of this ring of fortifications, was strategically important because of its proximity to both the River Thames, a key medieval route into London, and Windsor Forest, a royal hunting preserve previously used by the Saxon kings. The nearby settlement of Clivore, or Clewer, was an old Saxon residence. The initial wooden castle consisted of a keep on the top of a man-made motte, or mound, protected by a small bailey wall, occupying a chalk inlier, or bluff, rising 100 ft (30 m) above the river. A second wooden bailey was constructed to the east of the keep, forming the later Upper Ward. By the end of the century, another bailey had been constructed to the west, creating the basic shape of the modern castle.\n\n**11th and 12th centuries**\n\nWindsor Castle was originally built by William the Conqueror in the decade after the Norman conquest of 1066.

The castle played a role during the revolt of the English barons: the castle was besieged in 1214, and John used the castle as his base during the negotiations before the signing of Magna Carta at nearby Runnymede in 1215. In 1216 the castle was besieged again by baronial and French troops under the command of the Count of Nevers, but John's constable, Engelard de Cigogné, successfully defended it.\n\n**14th century**\n\nEdward III was born at Windsor Castle and used it extensively throughout his reign. In 1344 the king announced the foundation of the new Order of the Round Table at the castle. Edward began to construct a new building in the castle to host this order, but it was never finished. Chroniclers described it as a round building, 200 ft (61 m) across, and it was probably in the centre of the Upper Ward. Shortly afterwards, Edward abandoned the new order for reasons that remain unclear, and instead established the Order of the Garter, again with Windsor Castle as its headquarters, complete with the attendant Poor Knights of Windsor. As part of this process Edward decided to rebuild Windsor Castle, in particular Henry III's palace, in an attempt to construct a castle that would be symbolic of royal power and chivalry. Edward was influenced both by the military successes of his grandfather, Edward I, and by the decline of royal authority under his father, Edward II, and aimed to produce an innovative, \"self-consciously aesthetic, muscled, martial architecture.\"\n\n**15th century**\n\nWindsor Castle continued to be favoured by monarchs in the 15th century, despite increasing political violence. Henry IV seized the castle during his coup in 1399, although failing to catch Richard II, who had escaped to London. Under Henry V, the castle hosted a visit from the Holy Roman Emperor in 1417, a massive diplomatic event that stretched the castle's accommodation to its limits.\n\n**16th century**\n\nHenry VIII enjoyed Windsor Castle, as a young man \"exercising himself daily in shooting, singing, dancing, wrestling, casting of the bar, playing at the recorders, flute, virginals, in setting of songs and making of ballads.\" The tradition of the Garter Feasts was maintained and became more extravagant; the size of the royal retinue visiting Windsor had to be restricted because of the growing numbers.

Throughout the Tudor period, Windsor was also used as a safe retreat in the event of plagues occurring in London.\n\n**17th century**\n\nJames I used Windsor Castle primarily as a base for hunting, one of his favourite pursuits, and for socialising with his friends. Many of these occasions involved extensive drinking sessions, including one with Christian IV of Denmark in 1606 that became infamous across Europe for the resulting drunken behaviour of the two kings. The absence of space at Windsor continued to prove problematic, with James' English and Scottish retinues often quarrelling over rooms.\n\n**18th century**\n\nGeorge I took little interest in Windsor Castle, preferring his other palaces at St James's, Hampton Court, and Kensington. George II rarely used Windsor either, preferring Hampton Court. Many of the apartments in the Upper Ward were given out as \"grace and favour\" privileges for the use of prominent widows or other friends of the Crown. The Duke of Cumberland made the most use of the property in his role as the Ranger of Windsor Great Park. By the 1740s, Windsor Castle had become an early tourist attraction; wealthier visitors who could afford to pay the castle keeper could enter, see curiosities such as the castle's narwhal horn, and by the 1750s buy the first guidebooks to Windsor, produced by George Bickham in 1753 and Joseph Pote in 1755.\n\n**19th century**\n\nGeorge IV came to the throne in 1820 intending to create a set of royal palaces that reflected his wealth and influence as the ruler of an increasingly powerful Britain. George's previous houses, Carlton House and the Brighton Pavilion, were too small for grand court events, even after expensive extensions. George expanded the Royal Lodge in the castle park while he was Prince Regent, and then began a programme of work to modernise the castle itself once he became king.\n\n**20th century**\n\nEdward VII came to the throne in 1901 and immediately set about modernising Windsor Castle with \"enthusiasm and zest.\" Many of the rooms in the Upper Ward were de-cluttered and redecorated for the first time in many years, with Edward \"peering into cabinets; ransacking drawers; clearing rooms formerly used by the Prince Consort and not touched since his death; dispatching case-loads of relics and ornaments to a special room in the Round Tower... destroying statues and busts of John Brown... throwing out hundreds of 'rubbishy old coloured photographs'... and rearranging pictures.\" Electric lighting was added to more rooms, along with central heating; telephone lines were installed, along with garages for the newly invented automobiles.\n\n**1992 fire**\n\nOn 20 November 1992, a major fire occurred at Windsor Castle, lasting for 15 hours and causing widespread damage to the Upper Ward. The Private Chapel in the north-east corner of the State Apartments was being renovated as part of a long-term programme of work within the castle, and it is believed that one of the spotlights being used in the work set fire to a curtain by the altar during the morning. The fire spread quickly and destroyed nine of the principal state rooms and severely damaged more than 100 others. Fire-fighters applied water to contain the blaze, while castle staff attempted to rescue the precious artworks from the castle. Many of the rooms closest to the fire had been emptied as part of the renovation work, and this contributed to the successful evacuation of most of the collection.\n\n**21st century**\n\nWindsor Castle, part of the Occupied Royal Palaces Estate, is owned by Charles III in right of the Crown, and day-to-day management is by the Royal Household. In terms of population, Windsor Castle is the largest inhabited castle in the world and the longest-occupied palace in Europe, but it also remains a functioning royal home. As of 2006, around 500 people were living and working in the castle. Elizabeth II had increasingly used the castle as a royal palace as well as her weekend home before her death. In recent years, Windsor Castle has hosted visits from President Mbeki of South Africa, King Abdullah II of Jordan, and presidents Obama, Trump, and Biden of the United States. The castle remains an important ceremonial location. The Waterloo ceremony is carried out in the presence of the monarch each year, and the annual ceremony of the Order of the Garter takes place in St George's Chapel. When the Queen was in residence, the Guard Mounting ceremony occurred on a daily basis.

both of the current terraces were constructed by Hugh May in the 17th century [17] The East Terrace has a private formal rose garden, first laid out by George IV in the 1820s The present garden was updated by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, after it was used for victory garden production during World War II, tended in part by Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret In 2020 it was announced that for a limited time the garden would be open to the public for the first time in 40 years [18]\n\n\nState Apartments\nThe State Apartments form the major part of the Upper Ward and lie along the north side of the quadrangle The modern building follows the medieval foundations laid down by Edward III, with the ground floor comprising service chambers and cellars, and the much grander first floor forming the main part of the palace On the first floor, the layout of the western end of the State Apartments is primarily the work of architect Hugh May, whereas the structure on the eastern side represents Jeffry Wyatville's plans [nb 1]\n\n\nLower Ward\nThe Lower Ward lies below and to the west of the Round Tower, reached through the Norman Gate Originally largely of medieval design, most of the Lower Ward was renovated or reconstructed during the mid-Victorian period by Anthony Salvin and Edward Blore, to form a \"consistently Gothic composition\" [52] The Lower Ward holds St George's Chapel and most of the buildings associated with the Order of the Garter.\n\n\nPark and landscape\nWindsor Castle's position on top of steep ground has meant that the castle's gardens are limited in scale [65] The castle gardens stretch east from the Upper Ward across a 19th-century terrace [66] Windsor Castle is surrounded by extensive parkland The immediate area stretching to the east of the castle is a 19th-century creation known as the Home Park [67] The Home Park includes parkland and two working farms, along with many estate cottages mainly occupied by employees and the Frogmore estate The Long Walk, a double lined avenue of trees, runs for 2.65 miles (4.26 km) [68] south of the castle, and is 240 ft (73 m) wide [69] The original 17th century elms were replaced with alternating chestnut and plane trees The impact of Dutch elm disease led to large-scale replanting after 1945 [70]\n\n\nHistory\nWindsor Castle was originally built by William the Conqueror in the decade after the Norman conquest of 1066 [73] William established a defensive ring of motte and bailey castles around London; each was a day's march – about 20 miles (32 km) – from the City and from the next castle, allowing for easy reinforcements in a crisis [73] Windsor Castle, one of this ring of fortifications, was strategically important because of its proximity to both the River Thames, a key medieval route into London, and Windsor Forest, a royal hunting preserve previously used by the Saxon kings [74] The nearby settlement of Clivore, or Clewer, was an old Saxon residence The initial wooden castle consisted of a keep on the top of a man-made motte, or mound, protected by a small bailey wall, occupying a chalk inlier, or bluff, rising 100 ft (30 m) above the river [75] A second wooden bailey was constructed to the east of the keep, forming the later Upper Ward [76] By the end of the century, another bailey had been constructed to the west, creating the basic shape of the modern castle [76] [nb 5] In design, Windsor most closely resembled Arundel Castle, another powerful early Norman fortification, but the double bailey design was also found at Rockingham and Alnwick Castle [78]\n\n\n11th and 12th centuries\nWindsor Castle was originally built by William the Conqueror in the decade after the Norman conquest of 1066 [73] William established a defensive ring of motte and bailey castles around London; each was a day's march – about 20 miles (32 km) – from the City and from the next castle, allowing for easy reinforcements in a crisis [73] Windsor Castle, one of this ring of fortifications, was strategically important because of its proximity to both the River Thames, a key medieval route into London, and Windsor Forest, a royal hunting preserve previously used by the Saxon kings [74] The nearby settlement of Clivore, or Clewer, was an old Saxon residence The initial wooden castle consisted of a keep on the top of a man-made motte, or mound, protected by a small bailey wall, occupying a chalk inlier, or bluff, rising 100 ft (30 m) above the river [75] A second wooden bailey was constructed to the east of the keep, forming the later Upper Ward [76] By the end of the century, another bailey had been constructed to the west, creating the basic shape of the modern castle [76] [nb 5] In design, Windsor most closely resembled Arundel Castle, another powerful early Norman fortification, but the double bailey design was also found at Rockingham and Alnwick Castle [78]\n\n\n13th century\nKing John undertook some building works at Windsor, but primarily to the accommodation rather than the defences [84] The castle played a role during the revolt of the English barons: the castle was besieged in 1214, and John used the castle as his base during the negotiations before the signing of Magna Carta at nearby Runnymede in 1215 [84] In 1216 the castle was besieged again by baronial and French troops under the command of the Count of Nevers, but John's constable, Engelard de Cigogné, successfully defended it [84]\n\n\n14th century\nEdward III was born at Windsor Castle and used it extensively throughout his reign [91] In 1344 the king announced the foundation of the new Order of the Round Table at the castle [3] Edward began to construct a new building in the castle to host this order, but it was never finished [3] Chroniclers described it as a round building, 200 ft (61 m) across, and it was probably in the centre of the Upper Ward [92] Shortly afterwards, Edward abandoned the new order for reasons that remain unclear, and instead established the Order of the Garter, again with Windsor Castle as its headquarters, complete with the attendant Poor Knights of Windsor [3] As part of this process Edward decided to rebuild Windsor Castle, in particular Henry III's palace, in an attempt to construct a castle that would be symbolic of royal power and chivalry [93] Edward was influenced both by the military successes of his grandfather, Edward I, and by the decline of royal authority under his father, Edward II, and aimed to produce an innovative, \"self-consciously aesthetic, muscled, martial architecture\" [94]\n\n\n15th century\nWindsor Castle continued to be favoured by monarchs in the 15th century, despite increasing political violence [105] Henry IV seized the castle during his coup in 1399, although failing to catch Richard II, who had escaped to London [105] Under Henry V, the castle hosted a visit from the Holy Roman Emperor in 1417, a massive diplomatic event that stretched the castle's accommodation to its limits [106]\n\n\n16th century\nHenry VIII enjoyed Windsor Castle, as a young man \"exercising himself daily in shooting, singing, dancing, wrestling, casting of the bar, playing at the recorders, flute, virginals, in setting of songs and making of ballads\" [119] The tradition of the Garter Feasts was maintained and became more extravagant; the size of the royal retinue visiting Windsor had to be restricted because of the growing numbers [120] During the Pilgrimage of Grace, a huge uprising in the north of England against Henry's rule in 1536, the king used Windsor as a secure base in the south from which to manage his military response [121] Throughout the Tudor period, Windsor was also used as a safe retreat in the event of plagues occurring in London [122]\n\n\n17th century\nJames I used Windsor Castle primarily as a base for hunting, one of his favourite pursuits, and for socialising with his friends [141] Many of these occasions involved extensive drinking sessions, including one with Christian IV of Denmark in 1606 that became infamous across Europe for the resulting drunken behaviour of the two kings [142] The absence of space at Windsor continued to prove problematic, with James' English and Scottish retinues often quarrelling over rooms [142]\n\n\n18th century\nGeorge I took little interest in Windsor Castle, preferring his other palaces at St James's, Hampton Court and Kensington [164] George II rarely used Windsor either, preferring Hampton Court [165] Many of the apartments in the Upper Ward were given out as \"grace and favour\" privileges for the use of prominent widows or other friends of the Crown [166] The Duke of Cumberland made the most use of the property in his role as the Ranger of Windsor Great Park [167] By the 1740s, Windsor Castle had become an early tourist attraction; wealthier visitors who could afford to pay the castle keeper could enter, see curiosities such as the castle's narwhal horn, and by the 1750s buy the first guidebooks to Windsor, produced by George Bickham in 1753 and Joseph Pote in 1755 [168]  [nb 9] As the condition of the State Apartments continued to deteriorate, even the general public were able to regularly visit the property [170]\n\n\n19th century\nGeorge IV came to the throne in 1820 intending to create a set of royal palaces that reflected his wealth and influence as the ruler of an increasingly powerful Britain [182] George's previous houses, Carlton House and the Brighton Pavilion were too small for grand court events, even after expensive extensions [182] George expanded the Royal Lodge in the castle park while he was Prince Regent, and then began a programme of work to modernise the castle itself once he became king [182]\n\n\n20th century\nEdward VII came to the throne in 1901 and immediately set about modernising Windsor Castle with \"enthusiasm and zest\" [206] Many of the rooms in the Upper Ward were de-cluttered and redecorated for the first time in many years, with Edward \"peering into cabinets; ransacking drawers; clearing rooms formerly used by the Prince Consort and not touched since his death; dispatching case-loads of relics and ornaments to a special room in the Round Tower .. destroying statues and busts of John Brown .. throwing out hundreds of 'rubbishy old coloured photographs' ..  [and] rearranging pictures\" [207] Electric lighting was added to more rooms, along with central heating; telephone lines were installed, along with garages for the newly invented automobiles [208] The marathon was run from Windsor Castle at the 1908 Olympics, [nb 11] and in 1911 the pioneering aviator Thomas Sopwith landed an aircraft at the castle for the first time [209]\n\n\n1992 fire\nOn 20 November 1992, a major fire occurred at Windsor Castle, lasting for 15 hours and causing widespread damage to the Upper Ward [226] The Private Chapel in the north-east corner of the State Apartments was being renovated as part of a long term programme of work within the castle, and it is believed that one of the spotlights being used in the work set fire to a curtain by the altar during the morning [227] The fire spread quickly and destroyed nine of the principal state rooms and severely damaged more than 100 others [227] Fire-fighters applied water to contain the blaze, while castle staff attempted to rescue the precious artworks from the castle [228] Many of the rooms closest to the fire had been emptied as part of the renovation work, and this contributed to the successful evacuation of most of the collection [227]\n\n\n21st century\nWindsor Castle, part of the Occupied Royal Palaces Estate, is owned by Charles III in right of the Crown, [239] and day-to-day management is by the Royal Household [240] In terms of population, Windsor Castle is the largest inhabited castle in the world and the longest-occupied palace in Europe, but it also remains a functioning royal home [241] As of 2006, around 500 people were living and working in the castle [242] Elizabeth II had increasingly used the castle as a royal palace as well as her weekend home before her death [243] In recent years, Windsor Castle has hosted visits from President Mbeki of South Africa, King Abdullah II of Jordan and presidents Obama, [244] Trump, and Biden of the United States [245] The castle remains an important ceremonial location The Waterloo ceremony is carried out in the presence of the monarch each year, and the annual ceremony of the Order of the Garter takes place in St George's Chapel [246] When the Queen was in residence, the Guard Mounting ceremony occurred on a daily basis [247] The Royal Ascot procession leaves the castle each year during the annual meeting [248]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The case of the medal is manufactured from Japanese ash wood dyed with the same color as the Olympic emblem. The circular lid and the body of the case can be opened like a ring connected by a magnet. The obverse of the medals features Nike, the Greek goddess of victory, in front of the Panathenaic Stadium and the Olympic rings. The use of recycled metal extracted from small electronic devices donated by the public adds an eco-friendly element to the medal design.\n\nMedal Table\n\nThe medal table is based on information provided by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and is consistent with IOC convention in its published medal tables. The table uses the Olympic medal table sorting method, where the number of gold medals is taken into consideration first, followed by the number of silver medals, and then the number of bronze medals. If teams are still tied, equal ranking is given, and they are listed alphabetically by their IOC country code. This method ensures that the table accurately reflects the achievements of athletes from around the world.\n\nThe medal table for the 2020 Summer Olympics is as follows:\n\n| Rank | NOC | Gold | Silver | Bronze | Total |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | United States | 39 | 41 | 33 | 113 |\n| 2 | China | 38 | 32 | 19 | 89 |\n| 3 | Japan | 27 | 14 | 17 | 58 |\n| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |\n\nChanges in Medal Standings\n\nDuring the course of the Games, several athletes were disqualified for various reasons. These changes affected the medal standings, and the table was updated accordingly. The following athletes were disqualified:\n\n* ※ Disqualified athlete(s)\n\nSee Also\n\n* 2020 Summer Olympics\n* International Olympic Committee\n* Olympic medal table sorting method\n* Japanese art and design\n\nNotes\n\nThe medal table is a dynamic and ever-changing aspect of the Olympics, reflecting the achievements of athletes from around the world.

to the Amalienborg Palace complex in Copenhagen He was the second son and third child of Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg and Princess Louise of Hesse-Kassel [1] He was baptised with the names Christian William Ferdinand Adolph George, and until his accession in Greece, he was known as Prince William, [2] the namesake of both his grandfathers, William, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg, and Prince William of Hesse-Kassel.\n\n\nKing of the Hellenes\nFollowing the expulsion of Otto of Greece in October 1862, [5] the Greek people had rejected Otto's brother and designated successor Luitpold, although they still favored a monarchy rather than a republic Many Greeks, seeking closer ties to the pre-eminent world power, the United Kingdom, rallied around Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, second son of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert [6] British prime minister Lord Palmerston believed that the Greeks were \"panting for increase in territory\", [7] hoping for a gift of the Ionian Islands, which were then a British protectorate The London Conference of 1832, however, prohibited any of the Great Powers' ruling families from accepting the crown Queen Victoria herself was adamantly opposed to the idea The Greeks nevertheless insisted on holding a plebiscite in which Alfred received over 95% of the 240,000 votes [8] There were 93 votes for a Republic and six for a Greek national to be chosen as king [9] King Otto received one vote [10]\n\n\nEarly reign\nThe new 17-year-old king toured Saint Petersburg, London and Paris before departing for Greece from the French port of Toulon on 22 October aboard the Greek flagship Hellas He arrived in Athens on 30 October  [O.S 18 October] 1863, [15] after docking at Piraeus the previous day [16] He was determined not to make the mistakes of his predecessor, so he quickly learned Greek [17] The new king was seen frequently and informally in the streets of Athens, where his predecessor had only appeared in pomp [18] King George found the palace in a state of disarray, after the hasty departure of King Otto, and took to putting it right by mending and updating the 40-year-old building [19] He also sought to ensure that he was not seen as too influenced by his Danish advisers, ultimately sending his uncle, Prince Julius, back to Denmark with the words, \"I will not allow any interference with the conduct of my government\" [20] Another adviser, Count Wilhelm Sponneck, became unpopular for advocating a policy of disarmament and tactlessly questioning the descent of modern Greeks from classical antecedents Like Julius, he was dispatched back to Denmark [21]\n\n\nMarriage and children\nGeorge first met Grand Duchess Olga Constantinovna of Russia in 1863, when she was 12 years old, on a visit to the court of Tsar Alexander II between his election to the Greek throne and his arrival in Athens They met for a second time in April 1867, when George went to the Russian Empire to visit his sister Dagmar, who had married the Tsar's heir, Tsarevich Alexander While George was privately a Lutheran, [29] the Romanovs were Orthodox Christians like the majority of Greeks, and George thought a marriage with a Russian grand duchess would re-assure his subjects on the question of his future children's religion [30] Olga was just 16 years old when she married George at the Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg on 27 October 1867 After a honeymoon at Tsarskoye Selo, the couple left Russia for Greece on 9 November [31] Over the next twenty years, they had eight children:\n\n\nTerritorial expansion\nThroughout the 1870s, Greece kept pressure on the Ottoman Empire, seeking territorial expansion into Epirus and Thessaly The Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878 provided the first potential alliance for the Greek kingdom George's sister Dagmar was the daughter-in-law of Alexander II of Russia, and she sought to have Greece join the war The French and British refused to countenance such an act, and Greece remained neutral At the Congress of Berlin convened in 1878 to determine peace terms for the Russo-Turkish War, Greece staked a claim to Crete, Epirus and Thessaly [43]\n\n\nNational progress\nGeorge's silver jubilee in 1888 was celebrated throughout the Hellenic world, and Athens was decorated with garlands for the anniversary of his accession on 30 October [47] Visitors included the Crown Prince of Denmark, the Prince and Princess of Wales, the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh, Grand Dukes Sergei and Paul of Russia, and Djevad Pasha from the Ottoman Empire, who presented the King with two Arabian horses as gifts [48] Jubilee events in the week of 30 October included balls, galas, parades, a thanksgiving service at the Metropolitan Cathedral of Athens, and a lunch for 500 invited guests in a blue and white tent on the Acropolis [49]\n\n\nLater reign and assassination\nThe death of Britain's Queen Victoria on 22 January 1901 left King George as the second-longest-reigning monarch in Europe, behind only Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria [60] His always cordial relations with his brother-in-law, the new King Edward VII, continued to tie Greece to Britain This was abundantly important in Britain's support of King George's son Prince George as Governor-General of Crete Nevertheless, Prince George resigned in 1906 after a leader in the Cretan Assembly, Eleftherios Venizelos, campaigned to have him removed [61]\n\n\nHonours and arms\nThe distinctive Greek flag of blue and white cross was first hoisted

parents' residence the Yellow Palace, an 18th-century town house at 18 Amaliegade, next to the Amalienborg Palace complex in Copenhagen He was the second son and third child of Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg and Princess Louise of Hesse-Kassel [1] He was baptised with the names Christian William Ferdinand Adolph George, and until his accession in Greece, he was known as Prince William, [2] the namesake of both his grandfathers, William, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg, and Prince William of Hesse-Kassel.\n\n\nKing of the Hellenes\nFollowing the expulsion of Otto of Greece in October 1862, [5] the Greek people had rejected Otto's brother and designated successor Luitpold, although they still favored a monarchy rather than a republic Many Greeks, seeking closer ties to the pre-eminent world power, the United Kingdom, rallied around Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, second son of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert [6] British prime minister Lord Palmerston believed that the Greeks were \"panting for increase in territory\", [7] hoping for a gift of the Ionian Islands, which were then a British protectorate The London Conference of 1832, however, prohibited any of the Great Powers' ruling families from accepting the crown Queen Victoria herself was adamantly opposed to the idea The Greeks nevertheless insisted on holding a plebiscite in which Alfred received over 95% of the 240,000 votes [8] There were 93 votes for a Republic and six for a Greek national to be chosen as king [9] King Otto received one vote [10]\n\n\nEarly reign\nThe new 17-year-old king toured Saint Petersburg, London and Paris before departing for Greece from the French port of Toulon on 22 October aboard the Greek flagship Hellas He arrived in Athens on 30 October  [O.S 18 October] 1863, [15] after docking at Piraeus the previous day [16] He was determined not to make the mistakes of his predecessor, so he quickly learned Greek [17] The new king was seen frequently and informally in the streets of Athens, where his predecessor had only appeared in pomp [18] King George found the palace in a state of disarray, after the hasty departure of King Otto, and took to putting it right by mending and updating the 40-year-old building [19] He also sought to ensure that he was not seen as too influenced by his Danish advisers, ultimately sending his uncle, Prince Julius, back to Denmark with the words, \"I will not allow any interference with the conduct of my government\" [20] Another adviser, Count Wilhelm Sponneck, became unpopular for advocating a policy of disarmament and tactlessly questioning the descent of modern Greeks from classical antecedents Like Julius, he was dispatched back to Denmark [21]\n\n\nMarriage and children\nGeorge first met Grand Duchess Olga Constantinovna of Russia in 1863, when she was 12 years old, on a visit to the court of Tsar Alexander II between his election to the Greek throne and his arrival in Athens They met for a second time in April 1867, when George went to the Russian Empire to visit his sister Dagmar, who had married the Tsar's heir, Tsarevich Alexander While George was privately a Lutheran, [29] the Romanovs were Orthodox Christians like the majority of Greeks, and George thought a marriage with a Russian grand duchess would re-assure his subjects on the question of his future children's religion [30] Olga was just 16 years old when she married George at the Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg on 27 October 1867 After a honeymoon at Tsarskoye Selo, the couple left Russia for Greece on 9 November [31] Over the next twenty years, they had eight children:\n\n\nTerritorial expansion\nThroughout the 1870s, Greece kept pressure on the Ottoman Empire, seeking territorial expansion into Epirus and Thessaly The Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878 provided the first potential alliance for the Greek kingdom George's sister Dagmar was the daughter-in-law of Alexander II of Russia, and she sought to have Greece join the war The French and British refused to countenance such an act, and Greece remained neutral At the Congress of Berlin convened in 1878 to determine peace terms for the Russo-Turkish War, Greece staked a claim to Crete, Epirus and Thessaly [43]\n\n\nNational progress\nGeorge's silver jubilee in 1888 was celebrated throughout the Hellenic world, and Athens was decorated with garlands for the anniversary of his accession on 30 October [47] Visitors included the Crown Prince of Denmark, the Prince and Princess of Wales, the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh, Grand Dukes Sergei and Paul of Russia, and Djevad Pasha from the Ottoman Empire, who presented the King with two Arabian horses as gifts [48] Jubilee events in the week of 30 October included balls, galas, parades, a thanksgiving service at the Metropolitan Cathedral of Athens, and a lunch for 500 invited guests in a blue and white tent on the Acropolis [49]\n\n\nLater reign and assassination\nThe death of Britain's Queen Victoria on 22 January 1901 left King George as the second-longest-reigning monarch in Europe, behind only Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria [60] His always cordial relations with his brother-in-law, the new King Edward VII, continued to tie Greece to Britain This was abundantly important in Britain's support of King George's son Prince George as Governor-General of Crete Nevertheless, Prince George resigned in 1906 after a leader in the Cretan Assembly, Eleftherios Venizelos, campaigned to have him removed [61]\n\n\nHonours and arms\nThe distinctive Greek flag of blue and white cross was first hoisted during the Greek War of Independence in March 1822 [112] This was later modified so that the shade of blue matched that of the Bavarian coat of arms of the first King of Greece, Otto [113] The shield is emblazoned with a smaller version of the royal arms of Denmark, including the three lions of the arms of Denmark proper, the two lions of Schleswig, the nettle leaf of Holstein, the horse head of Lauenburg, the two red bars of the House of Oldenburg and the cross of Delmenhorst The supporters on either side both depicting Heracles are quite similar to the two wild men from the Danish royal arms Beneath the shield is the motto in Greek, Ἰσχύς μου ἡ αγάπη τοῦ λαοῦ (\"The people's love is my

Widow went one year without being in any new comic books, until she appeared in Avengers #76 (1970) to end her relationship with Hawkeye, effectively making her an independent character [13] She then underwent a full redesign in The Amazing Spider-Man #86 (1970), where she was given the black costume and long red hair that became identified with her character [14] Marvel followed this the same year with a series of Black Widow stories published in Amazing Adventures, which also published stories about the Inhumans [15] Marvel's first series to feature stories led by a female superhero, [16] it portrayed Black Widow as a wealthy jet setter who doubled as a crime-fighter [17] The first issues, written by Gary Friedrich and drawn by Gene Colan, were about political issues Writers Roy Thomas and then Gerry Conway moved it away from politics in favor of melodrama, developing the relationship between Black Widow and her father figure Ivan Petrovich [18] The series ran for eight issues, after which she was removed from the comic book so the Inhumans could be given a standalone series [19]\n\n\n1980s\nBlack Widow was less prominent in the 1980s [19] She made an appearance in the anthology book Bizarre Adventures #25 (1981), as one of heroines leading a story written by Ralph Macchio and drawn by Paul Gulacy under the issue's \"Lethal Ladies\" theme [31] The story followed Black Widow as she infiltrated a Soviet arms depot in South Africa led by her former instructor [32] Macchio moved away from elements he felt were reminiscent of James Bond, instead looking to the works of John le Carré for inspiration so readers \"really didn't know who were the good guys and the bad guys\" [33] Black Widow made another return to Daredevil beginning in issue #187 (1982), created by Frank Miller Miller redesigned her, giving her a more casual and masculine appearance with a gray leotard and shorter hair [34] She also appeared in the shared books Marvel Two-in-One and

Avengers for a period of time Her association with the Avengers increased her prominence among Marvel superheroes, allowing for appearances in Captain America and Force Works [19] Black Widow returned to Daredevil in issue #362 (1997), which had her become more vengeful as she responded to the Onslaught event that caused the apparent deaths of her allies in the Avengers [40] She reappeared in the new volume of the Avengers, but only infrequently as a guest character [19] Black Widow's Marvel Fanfare story was reprinted as a single volume in 1999, titled Black Widow: Web of Intrigue [27]\n\n\n2000s\nGrayson wrote a second three-issue Black Widow miniseries featuring the Natasha and Yelena Black Widows in 2001, alongside co-writer Greg Rucka and artist Scott Hampton [47] Black Widow returned to Daredevil in its \"The Widow\" storyline (2004) by writer Brian Michael Bendis and artist Alex Maleev [48] Richard K Morgan wrote Black Widow: Homecoming in 2004 with Bill Sienkiewicz and Goran Parlov, simplifying Black Widow's backstory into a consistent series of events [36] The series featured a more violent Black Widow and ran for six issues Morgan then wrote another six-issue series, Black Widow: The Things They Say About Her, in 2006 with Sienkiewicz and Sean Phillips This continued from the previous series and followed Black Widow as she went on the run from S.H.I.E.L.D [49] An alternate version of Black Widow was created for the Ultimate Universe in the 2000s, where she is a member of the Ultimates [50]\n\n\n2010s\nBlack Widow became more widely known to the public after the character was adapted to film in Iron Man 2 (2010) The film's emphasis on her as a spy instead of a superhero influenced how she was portrayed in comics over the following years With the character's popularity came additional publications Black Widow and the Marvel Girls (2010) was created by Salvador Espin, Veronica Gandini, Takeshi Miyazawa, and Paul Tobin [36]\n\n\n2020s\nMacchio joined artist Simon Buonfantino in a return to Black Widow with Black Widow: Widow's Sting in 2020 The one-shot comic was written as a more traditional spy drama, using many of the genre's common tropes [61] Kelly Thompson began writing a Black Widow series the same year, with Elena Casagrande as the volume's artist [36] The series was split into three story arcs: \"The Ties that Bind\" introduced a brainwashed Black Widow who believed she lived a domestic life as a mother, [62] \"I Am the Black Widow\" continued the story with her memory returned and a new team of sidekicks and partners fighting alongside her, [63] and \"Die by the Blade\" concluded the 15-issue series with Black Widow and her team fighting a human-trafficking ring

leading her to believe that she had previously been a ballerina [72] She was selected from the participants in the program to become a spy and receives the codename \"Black Widow\" [36] [72]\n\n\nPersonality and motivation\nAs a superhero, Black Widow seeks to right the wrongs she committed earlier in life [78] She is more willing to kill adversaries than most superheroes, [9] and she has been described as emotionally cold since her first appearance [79] Black Widow is naturally independent, and she capably works alone [21] Black Widow projects an air of confidence in her civilian life, [80] and she is self-assured in her physical appearance and her ability to leverage it [81] She chooses not to wear a mask, which she sees as a statement of confidence in herself, [14] though in her early crime-fighting stories she was uncertain about whether she would regret letting others see her face [82] Black Widow was less confident overall in the early days of her superhero career [82]\n\n\nAbilities and equipment\nBlack Widow was trained as a spy in the Red Room, [36] and she possess expert knowledge about the practice of espionage [7] She uses her physical attractiveness to her advantage as a spy, manipulating others through seduction [84] Unlike many superheroes, Black Widow is not associated with superhuman powers [85] Instead, she underwent biochemical modification while training in the Red Room, increasing her physical prowess and slowing her aging [86] Black Widow is a master of hand-to-hand combat, with training in aikido, boxing, judo, karate, and savate She also has training in most weapons and can operate most vehicles [71] Outside of combat, Black Widow is a gymnast, [2] [71] and she was taught ballet while in the Red Room [36] She is fluent in Chinese, English, French, German, and Russian, among other languages [71] As of the \"Venom War\" storyline, Black Widow has the powers of a symbiote host [65]\n\n\nThemes and motifs\nThe character of Black Widow was first introduced as a Soviet communist, and her origin is defined by the Cold War [4] [88] As a communist spy, she was a foil for Iron Man and his symbolic representation of American values, [89] where the danger posed by Black Widow demonstrated a danger posed by the Soviet Union and communism [90] Her role as a spy suggested a sense of dishonesty and deceit from Soviets that contrasted with Iron Man's role as a noble and selfless American [91] Black Widow was surprised to see Iron Man risk his life to save Soviets, suggesting that such morality was unfamiliar to the Soviet Union [88] [91] When Black Widow chose to stop working with her Soviet handlers, they forced her to continue, first by threatening her parents and then by brainwashing her, reminiscent of the Soviet Union's image as a country without liberty [92] With her defection to the United States, Marvel reinforced its interpretation of Black Widow as an agent of good through her work with the American heroes opposed to her villainous period with the Soviet Union [93]\n\n\nCommunism and Russophobia\nThe character of Black Widow was first introduced as a Soviet communist, and her origin is defined by the Cold War [4] [88] As a communist spy, she was a foil for Iron Man and his symbolic representation of American values, [89] where the danger posed by Black Widow demonstrated a danger posed by the Soviet Union and communism [90] Her role as a spy suggested a sense of dishonesty and deceit from Soviets that contrasted with Iron Man's role as a noble and selfless American [91] Black Widow was surprised to see Iron Man risk his life to save Soviets, suggesting that such morality was unfamiliar to the Soviet Union [88] [91] When Black Widow chose to stop working with her Soviet handlers, they forced her to continue, first by threatening her parents and then by brainwashing her, reminiscent of the Soviet Union's image as a country without liberty [92] With her defection to the United States, Marvel reinforced its interpretation of Black Widow as an agent of good through her work with the American heroes opposed to her villainous period with the Soviet Union [93]\n\n\nFeminism and sexuality\nBlack Widow was the first solo female superhero created by Marvel Comics [75] Unlike most heroines to that point, she was not a love interest or a female derivative of a male character, and she was not created to fulfill a motherly or domestic role [102] She contrasted herself from other female Marvel characters in the 1960s by fighting her enemies in hand-to-hand combat [9] [96] The character was created in a time of uncertainty around gender roles in the United States, as a growing feminist movement competed with traditional femininity [102] By the 1980s, differing cultural expectations of women meant that her portrayals varied significantly between these focuses [103] Black Widow sometimes subverts gender roles as the more ruthless character in contrast with more empathetic male characters [104] Her characterization as a woman who rejects domesticity and poses a danger to men is representative of the female black widow spider, which kills and eats its male partner [105] [90] In her first appearance, Black Widow is likened to the exotic dancer and alleged spy Mata Hari [90] Other aspects of Black Widow remain in alignment with traditional gender roles, including her practice as a ballerina and her portrayal as a victim of trauma [96] As part of the Black Widow program, Natasha's body was modified to make her infertile and to give her a permanent hourglass figure [86]\n\n\nSupporting characters\nIt was my idea to team up Daredevil and the Black Widow, mainly because I was a fan of Natasha, and thought she and Daredevil would have interesting chemistry I'm not sure what I based this on, other than my desire to bring the characters together I'm a sucker for redheads!\n\n\nReception\nBlack Widow was not well known in popular culture until she was adapted to film in Iron Man 2 (2010) [36] Portrayals of Black Widow have been criticized as sexist, as she has often worn revealing outfits and played a subservient role to male characters [24] Writer Gerry Conway cited his work on Black Widow as his inspiration when he created Cinder and Ashe for DC Comics [27]\n\n\nIn other media\nIn 1975, Angie Bowie wished to make a film or television series starring herself as Black Widow The idea came while she was having lunch with Stan Lee, and he sold her the film rights for one dollar Bowie had costumes made and cast Ben Carruthers as Daredevil, but she was unable to get funding for the project and its production only went as far as test photography [127]\n\n\nSee

She also appeared in the shared books Marvel Two-in-One and Marvel Team-Up.\n\n**1990s**\n\nBlack Widow was the subject of the 61st Marvel Graphic Novel, \"The Coldest War\" (1990). In this story, she is tricked into believing that her husband is alive and is forced to work for the Soviet Union to save him. She returned to her black jumpsuit in the 1990s, and she began working alongside Iron Man during the run of writer John Byrne and artist Paul Ryan, beginning in Iron Man #269 (1991). Black Widow again became a member of the Avengers with its new roster in Avengers #343 (1992). This led to her becoming the leader of the Avengers for a period of time. Her association with the Avengers increased her prominence among Marvel superheroes, allowing for appearances in Captain America and Force Works. Black Widow returned to Daredevil in issue #362 (1997), which had her become more vengeful as she responded to the Onslaught event that caused the apparent deaths of her allies in the Avengers. She reappeared in the new volume of the Avengers, but only infrequently as a guest character. Black Widow's Marvel Fanfare story was reprinted as a single volume in 1999, titled Black Widow: Web of Intrigue.\n\n**2000s**\n\nGrayson wrote a second three-issue Black Widow miniseries featuring the Natasha and Yelena Black Widows in 2001, alongside co-writer Greg Rucka and artist Scott Hampton. Black Widow returned to Daredevil in its \"The Widow\" storyline (2004) by writer Brian Michael Bendis and artist Alex Maleev. Richard K Morgan wrote Black Widow: Homecoming in 2004 with Bill Sienkiewicz and Goran Parlov, simplifying Black Widow's backstory into a consistent series of events. The series featured a more violent Black Widow and ran for six issues. Morgan then wrote another six-issue series, Black Widow: The Things They Say About Her, in 2006 with Sienkiewicz and Sean Phillips. This continued from the previous series and followed Black Widow as she went on the run from S.H.I.E.L.D. An alternate version of Black Widow was created for the Ultimate Universe in the 2000s, where she is a member of the Ultimates.\n\n**2010s**\n\nBlack Widow became more widely known to the public after the character was adapted to film in Iron Man 2 (2010). The film's emphasis on her as a spy instead of a superhero influenced how she was portrayed in comics over the following years. With the character's popularity came additional publications Black Widow and the Marvel Girls (2010) was created by Salvador Espin, Veronica Gandini, Takeshi Miyazawa, and Paul Tobin.\n\n**2020s**\n\nMacchio joined artist Simon Buonfantino in a return to Black Widow with Black Widow: Widow's Sting in 2020. The one-shot comic was written as a more traditional spy drama, using many of the genre's common tropes. Kelly Thompson began writing a Black Widow series the same year, with Elena Casagrande as the volume's artist. The series was split into three story arcs: \"The Ties that Bind\" introduced a brainwashed Black Widow who believed she lived a domestic life as a mother, \"I Am the Black Widow\" continued the story with her memory returned and a new team of sidekicks and partners fighting alongside her, and \"Die by the Blade\" concluded the 15-issue series with Black Widow and her team fighting a human-trafficking ring.\n\n**Characterization**\n\nNatalia \"Natasha\" Alinovna Romanova was born in Russia, where she was thrown from a burning building in Stalingrad. She is found and raised by the soldier Ivan Petrovich. The Hand attempts to kidnap and brainwash her in 1941, but she is rescued by Captain America and Wolverine. Natasha marries Alexei Shostakov, but the KGB fakes his death to motivate Natasha to become a spy. She trains in the Red Room, where she is augmented through biotechnology; the process brings her body to its physical peak and slows cellular degeneration, enabling her to remain young and in her prime for decades. The program also gives her false memories of her life, leading her to believe that she had previously been a ballerina. She was selected from the participants in the program to become a spy and receives the codename \"Black Widow.\"\n\n**Personality and Motivation**\n\nAs a superhero, Black Widow seeks to right the wrongs she committed earlier in life. She is more willing to kill adversaries than most superheroes, and she has been described as emotionally cold since her first appearance. Black Widow is naturally independent, and she capably works alone. Black Widow projects an air of confidence in her civilian life, and she is self-assured in her physical appearance and her ability to leverage it. She chooses not to wear a mask, which she sees as a statement of confidence in herself, though in her early crime-fighting stories she was uncertain about whether she would regret letting others see her face. Black Widow was less confident overall in the early days of her superhero career.\n\n**Abilities and Equipment**\n\nBlack Widow was trained as a spy in the Red Room, and she possess expert knowledge about the practice of espionage. She uses her physical attractiveness to her advantage as a spy, manipulating others through seduction. Unlike many superheroes, Black Widow is not associated with superhuman powers. Instead, she underwent biochemical modification while training in the Red Room, increasing her physical prowess and slowing her aging. Black Widow is a master of hand-to-hand combat, with training in aikido, boxing, judo, karate, and savate. She also has training in most weapons and can operate most vehicles. Outside of combat, Black Widow is a gymnast, and she was taught ballet while in the Red Room. She is fluent in Chinese, English, French, German, and Russian, among other languages. As of the \"Venom War\" storyline, Black Widow has the powers of a symbiote host.\n\n**Themes and Motifs**\n\nThe character of Black Widow was first introduced as a Soviet communist, and her origin is defined by the Cold War. As a communist spy, she was a foil for Iron Man and his symbolic representation of American values, where the danger posed by Black Widow demonstrated a danger posed by the Soviet Union and communism. Her role as a spy suggested a sense of dishonesty and deceit from Soviets that contrasted with Iron Man's role as a noble and selfless American. Black Widow was surprised to see Iron Man risk his life to save Soviets, suggesting that such morality was unfamiliar to the Soviet Union. When Black Widow chose to stop working with her Soviet handlers, they forced her to continue, first by threatening her parents and then by brainwashing her, reminiscent of the Soviet Union's image as a country without liberty. With her defection to the United States, Marvel reinforced its interpretation of Black Widow as an agent of good through her work with the American heroes opposed to her villainous period with the Soviet Union.\n\n**Communism and Russophobia**\n\nThe character of Black Widow was first introduced as a Soviet communist, and her origin is defined by the Cold War.

With her defection to the United States, Marvel reinforced its interpretation of Black Widow as an agent of good through her work with the American heroes opposed to her villainous period with the Soviet Union.\n\n**Feminism and Sexuality**\n\nBlack Widow was the first solo female superhero created by Marvel Comics. Unlike most heroines to that point, she was not a love interest or a female derivative of a male character, and she was not created to fulfill a motherly or domestic role. She contrasted herself from other female Marvel characters in the 1960s by fighting her enemies in hand-to-hand combat. The character was created in a time of uncertainty around gender roles in the United States, as a growing feminist movement competed with traditional femininity. By the 1980s, differing cultural expectations of women meant that her portrayals varied significantly between these focuses. Black Widow sometimes subverts gender roles as the more ruthless character in contrast with more empathetic male characters. Her characterization as a woman who rejects domesticity and poses a danger to men is representative of the female black widow spider, which kills and eats its male partner. In her first appearance, Black Widow is likened to the exotic dancer and alleged spy Mata Hari. Other aspects of Black Widow remain in alignment with traditional gender roles, including her practice as a ballerina and her portrayal as a victim of trauma. As part of the Black Widow program, Natasha's body was modified to make her infertile and to give her a permanent hourglass figure.\n\n**Supporting Characters**\n\nIt was my idea to team up Daredevil and the Black Widow, mainly because I was a fan of Natasha, and thought she and Daredevil would have interesting chemistry. I'm not sure what I based this on, other than my desire to bring the characters together. I'm a sucker for redheads!\n\n**Reception**\n\nBlack Widow was not well known in popular culture until she was adapted to film in Iron Man 2 (2010). Portrayals of Black Widow have been criticized as sexist, as she has often worn revealing outfits and played a subservient role to male characters. Writer Gerry Conway cited his work on Black Widow as his inspiration when he created Cinder and Ashe for DC Comics.\n\n**In Other Media**\n\nIn 1975, Angie Bowie wished to make a film or television series starring herself as Black Widow. The idea came while she was having lunch with Stan Lee, and he sold her the film rights for one dollar. Bowie had costumes made and cast Ben Carruthers as Daredevil, but she was unable to get funding for the project and its production only went as far as test photography.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* List of Black Widow comics\n* List of Marvel Comics characters\n\n**Notes**\n\nThis article is a comprehensive overview of the character of Black Widow in the Marvel Comics universe.

comic books, until she appeared in Avengers #76 (1970) to end her relationship with Hawkeye, effectively making her an independent character [13] She then underwent a full redesign in The Amazing Spider-Man #86 (1970), where she was given the black costume and long red hair that became identified with her character [14] Marvel followed this the same year with a series of Black Widow stories published in Amazing Adventures, which also published stories about the Inhumans [15] Marvel's first series to feature stories led by a female superhero, [16] it portrayed Black Widow as a wealthy jet setter who doubled as a crime-fighter [17] The first issues, written by Gary Friedrich and drawn by Gene Colan, were about political issues Writers Roy Thomas and then Gerry Conway moved it away from politics in favor of melodrama, developing the relationship between Black Widow and her father figure Ivan Petrovich [18] The series ran for eight issues, after which she was removed from the comic book so the Inhumans could be given a standalone series [19]\n\n\n1980s\nBlack Widow was less prominent in the 1980s [19] She made an appearance in the anthology book Bizarre Adventures #25 (1981), as one of heroines leading a story written by Ralph Macchio and drawn by Paul Gulacy under the issue's \"Lethal Ladies\" theme [31] The story followed Black Widow as she infiltrated a Soviet arms depot

{"title": "Hurricane_Irma", "content": "\nMeteorological history\nThe National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring a tropical wave over western Africa on August 26 [5] Developing into a tropical depression just west of the Cape Verde Islands early on August 31, becoming Tropical Storm Irma shortly afterwards [6] Under favorable conditions, Irma underwent rapid intensification, becoming a major hurricane on September 1 Within a 48-hour period, the hurricane's intensity had increased by 65 mph (105 km/h) [6] Fluctuations occurred over the next few days due to internal processes, as The first aircraft reconnaissance mission discovered an eye 29 mi (47 km) in diameter and surface winds of 115 mph (185 km/h) on September 3 [7] [8]\n\n\nPreparations\nGiven that Irma's forecast track was along much of the Caribbean island chain, hurricane warnings were issued for the northern Leeward Islands, Puerto Rico, and parts of Hispaniola on September 5 [6]\n\n\nCaribbean\nHurricane Irma's path was such that its impact was both far-reaching and devastating, with landfalls in Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Martin, the Bahamas, Cuba, and the United States, all at major hurricane intensity Furthermore, the size of the storm system meant that destruction was prevalent even in territories well removed from landfall occurrences Irma is the second-costliest Caribbean hurricane on record, after Maria [90]\n\n\nMainland United States\nHurricane Irma affected multiple states in the South, especially Florida Except for the Florida Keys, the total damage Irma caused was not as great as government officials and forecasters had warned Irma weakened after making landfall in Cuba, but strengthened back into a Category 4 prior to hitting the Keys The Florida Keys suffered the worst of the damage in the United States After surveying the aftermath of Irma, Florida governor Rick Scott said \"I thought we would see more damage\"  [on the mainland] but said \"he witnessed devastation in the Keys\" [161] President Donald Trump commented on Twitter that the devastation in some places was \"far greater than anyone thought\" [162]\n\n\nFlorida\nSporadic reports of looting and burglaries at several Miami Metro area businesses occurred with the theft of non-essential items such as sports apparel and athletic shoes during the height of the storm [247] [248]\n\n\nElsewhere\nGeorgia Governor Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency initially for all six coastal counties on September 6, but eventually expanded the declaration to 94 counties south of Atlanta metropolitan area, and then the entire state on September 10 Atlanta was placed under its first-ever tropical storm warning [55] [56] Governor Deal ordered mandatory evacuations for all areas east of Interstate 95 on September 7, before extending the order to the entirety of Chatham County and low-lying areas west of I-95 on the following day [57] In total, 540,000 people on the Georgia coast were ordered to leave [58] Contraflow lane reversal for Interstate 16 took effect on the morning of September 9 from Savannah to Dublin, Georgia [59] All Georgia state parks were open for free to evacuees, as was the 800-acre camping area at Atlanta Motor Speedway [60] Reversible HOT lanes on Interstate 75 in Georgia through south metro Atlanta were open 24 hours northbound with no tolls [61]\n\n\nSports\nIn professional sports, the Miami Dolphins–Tampa Bay Buccaneers game scheduled for September 10 at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami was postponed to November 19 due to the storm's threat The Dolphins left early for their road game against the Los Angeles Chargers [68] The Tampa Bay Rays and New York Yankees moved their September 11–13 series from Tropicana Field in St Petersburg to Citi Field in Queens [68] Minor League Baseball's Florida State League, Carolina League, and Southern League called off their championship finals and as a result, named their division series winners league co-champions [69] [70] [71] The Miami FC versus San Francisco Deltas match on September 10 was canceled so the players and staff could prepare for the storm with their families [72] The Orlando Pride of the National Women's Soccer League rescheduled their September 9 match to September 7 [73] Orlando City SC of Major League Soccer did not have any scheduled home games in September, but was unable to return to training facilities in Orlando due to Hurricane Irma [74]\n\n\nFEMA funding\nAs of September 5, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) funding was running dangerously low, due to its response to Hurricane Harvey in Texas the previous week, prompting the Trump administration to request an immediate $8 billion in additional funding as Irma approached Florida [79] Given the rate that current funds are being consumed and the catastrophic damage, the United States Senate almost doubled the requested amount to $15.3 billion, with the understanding that this would only be about 10% of what will be required for responding to Harvey [80]\n\n\nImpact\nHurricane Irma's path was such that its impact was both far-reaching and devastating, with landfalls in Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Martin, the Bahamas, Cuba, and the United States, all at major hurricane intensity Furthermore, the size of the storm system meant that destruction was prevalent even in territories well removed from landfall occurrences Irma is the second-costliest Caribbean hurricane on record, after Maria [90]\n\n\nCaribbean\nHurricane Irma's path was such that its impact was both far-reaching and devastating,

prevalent even in territories well removed from landfall occurrences Irma is the second-costliest Caribbean hurricane on record, after Maria [90]\n\n\nAntigua and Barbuda\nIn response to Hurricane Jose's approach, the Government of Antigua and Barbuda issued a mandatory evacuation on September 9 for any remaining residents on Barbuda A Miami cargo plane landed on Antigua later that day, carrying over 60 tons (120,000 lbs) of relief supplies for the displaced storm victims—including bottled water, canned food and power generators [213]\n\n\nSaint Martin\nOn the morning of September 6, Irma's center crossed the island of Saint Martin while the storm was at peak intensity, sweeping away entire structures, submerging roads and cars, and triggering an island-wide blackout [98] Irma's extreme winds ripped trees out of the ground and sent vehicles and debris from damaged structures scattered across the territory On the French side of Saint-Martin, entire marinas around Marigot were left in ruins, littered with the stranded remnants of boats that had smashed into each other [99] A hotel caught on fire, but dangerous conditions and impassable roads prevented firefighters from putting out the blaze Another hotel lost nearly all of its ground floor [100] Media images depicted devastated room interiors with furniture hurled around after the winds had shattered their windows [99] Irma killed four people on the French side of the island and injured 50 others, one of whom was in critical condition As many as 95% of the buildings there were damaged to some degree; 60% of those were totally uninhabitable [101] Estimates from CEDIM indicate a minimum of $950 million worth of economic losses [81] Total losses exceeded €3.5 billion (US$4.17 billion) [86]\n\n\nSaint Barthélemy\nIrma left widespread destruction and disastrous flooding along its path over the French island of Saint Barthélemy, southeast of Saint Martin Describing the extent of the destruction, one local compared it to \"a bomb that burned all vegetation,\" while another said that it were as if the hurricane had effectively \"erased the island from the map\" [108] Violent seas swept away entire coastal establishments, with one hotel being stripped of all but its foundation [109] Streets in the capital of Gustavia were turned into rushing rivers, which carried away vehicles and pieces of furniture The island's fire station was inundated with up to 6.4 ft (2.0 m) of flood waters [109] [110] With scores of homes and much of the infrastructure destroyed, the majority of the island's population was left stranded and without water, electricity or phone service [108] The associated economic losses could exceed $480 million according to CEDIM's analysts [81]\n\n\nAnguilla\nThe British Overseas Territory of Anguilla saw the eyewall of the storm pass over it on September 6 Many homes and schools were destroyed, and the island's only hospital was badly damaged [6] The devastation was particularly severe in East End, where the winds uprooted scores of trees and power poles and demolished a number of houses In The Valley, the island's capital, the hurricane blew out the windows of government buildings Rough seas inflicted heavy damage upon several bays and harbors, and a seaside restaurant was completely eradicated [113] About 90% of roads were left impassable [6] The island's air traffic control tower was damaged, exacerbating the already poor communication with the island [114] One death was reported on the island Estimates of losses on the island total at least $190 million [6]\n\n\nRest of the Lesser Antilles\nLarge swells ahead of Irma washed ashore debris and sea life in Castries, Saint Lucia, blocking some roads Seaside roads were inundated with water [115] One surfer was killed amid rough surf in Barbados after hitting a reef and breaking his neck Trees were also destroyed [116] The hurricane's effects, such as violent seas and rattling trees, were intense enough to be detected by seismographs in Guadeloupe Several houses were damaged [117] Around 8,000 households and a water supply network on that island lost power during the storm, leaving several communes in the dark without running water Overall damage was limited to external parts of houses and trees that were blown onto roads and three unmanned ships wrecked by rough seas [20]\n\n\nBritish Virgin Islands\nDamage in the British Virgin Islands was extensive Numerous buildings and roads were destroyed on the island of Tortola, which bore the brunt of the hurricane's core Four people were confirmed dead [6] Along Cane Garden Bay, the storm surge submerged several seaside bars and a gas station Satellite images revealed many of the island's residential zones had been left in ruins [113] The hurricane passed over Necker Island, also causing severe damage and destroying the mansion of Richard Branson [121]\n\n\nU.S. Virgin Islands\nIrma's effects in the U.S Virgin Islands were most profound on Saint Thomas, where at least 12 inches (300 mm) of rain fell, and on Saint John Saint Thomas island suffered widespread structural damage, including to its police station and airport Patients from the fourth and third floors of Charlotte Amalie's hospital had to be relocated to lower floors due to flooding from roof leaks Three deaths were attributed to Irma on the island On nearby Saint Croix, there were communication issues and some damage to the infrastructure [113] Saint John lost access to ferry and cargo services, along with access to the local airport Due to its normal reliance on electricity from Saint Thomas, the island was left without power [125] [126] [127] [128] Total damage from the three islands was at least $1.1 billion.\n\n\nPuerto Rico\nThe hurricane passed north of Puerto Rico, but still caused significant damage to the United States territory Along the coast, a tide gauge observed waves up to 1.5 ft (0.46 m) mean higher high water Much of the main island experienced sustained tropical storm force winds, with a peak sustained wind speed of 55 mph (89 km/h) at a weather station along San Juan Bay, while the same site observed a peak wind gust of 74 mph (119 km/h) [6] However, on the island of Culebra, a wind gust of 111 mph (179 km/h) was reported [129] Mainly due to strong winds, approximately 1.1 million out of 1.5 million of Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority's customers lost electricity [130] Portions of Puerto Rico received heavy rainfall, with a peak total of 13.04 in (331 mm) in Bayamón, [6] causing seven rivers to reach flood stage, widespread flash flooding, and at least six landslides [130]\n\n\nHispaniola\nIn the Dominican Republic, flooding worsened following Irma's departure, leading the number of displaced persons to increase to more than 24,000 by September 8 President Danilo Medina ordered further evacuations due to at-risk dams, while the government banned swimming in rivers and ordered boats kept in port [235] More than 422,000 people were left without water due to 28 aqueducts being damaged [236]\n\n\nTurks and Caicos Islands\nOn the evening of September 7, at 7:30 p.m AST (23:30 UTC), Hurricane Irma reached the Turks and Caicos Islands While the eye passed just south of the main islands, crossing over South Caicos and the Ambergris Cays, the most powerful winds on the northern side of the eye swept all of the islands for more than two hours Communications infrastructure was destroyed [6]\n\n\nThe Bahamas\nBy the afternoon of September 9, Bahamas Power and Light Company had dispatched crews across the archipelago to repair infrastructure damage The southernmost islands, which were most severely affected by Irma's eye, remained largely inaccessible for days [227] Assessments showed that 15% of the national telecommunications network had been affected, with at least one tower destroyed [228] Bahamasair resumed a limited domestic schedule on September 10, with international flights still canceled due to existing and anticipated destruction at other destinations [229]\n\n\nCuba\nSwollen rivers contributed to worsening flooding in the days after the storm system left, resulting in additional evacuations Officials resorted to using inflatable rafts to access affected areas The national electrical infrastructure was said to be extensively damaged [156]\n\n\nMainland United States\nHurricane Irma affected multiple states in the South, especially Florida Except for the Florida Keys, the total damage Irma caused was not as great as government officials and forecasters had warned Irma weakened after making landfall in Cuba, but strengthened back into a Category 4 prior to hitting the Keys The Florida Keys suffered the worst of the damage in the United States After surveying the aftermath of Irma, Florida governor Rick Scott said \"I thought we would see more damage\"  [on the mainland] but said \"he witnessed devastation in the Keys\" [161] President Donald Trump commented on Twitter that the devastation in some places was \"far greater than anyone thought\" [162]\n\n\nFlorida\nSporadic reports of looting and burglaries at several Miami Metro area businesses occurred with the theft of non-essential items such as sports apparel and athletic shoes during the height of the storm [247] [248]\n\n\nOther states\nThree deaths were reported in Georgia due to falling trees and debris, along with widespread wind damage and power outages throughout the state primarily due to fallen trees [196] On Tybee Island, as well as St Simons Island the storm surge caused extensive flooding [197] [198] The tropical storm also did $54 million in damage in the state [199]\n\n\nAftermath\nIn the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Irma's path through the West Indies and Caribbean, the devastation to roads, harbors and airports significantly impeded the transportation and distribution of relief supplies Foreign countries moved to provide much of the initial aid The British, Dutch, French, and United States governments sent warships and planes with supplies and manpower to the region [29] [207] International leaders, including Dutch King Willem-Alexander and French President Emmanuel Macron, quickly moved to visit affected territories [208] [209]\n\n\nAntigua and Barbuda\nIn response to Hurricane Jose's approach, the Government of Antigua and Barbuda issued a mandatory evacuation on September 9 for any remaining residents on Barbuda A Miami cargo plane landed on Antigua later that day, carrying over 60 tons (120,000 lbs) of relief supplies for the displaced storm victims—including bottled water, canned food and power generators [213]\n\n\nBritish Overseas Territories\nRFA Mounts Bay stationed itself near Anguilla and provided support and relief work to the island with its helicopters and 40 marines and army engineers [214] The ship delivered 6 tonnes of emergency aid to Anguilla and army engineers repaired a fuel leak at Anguilla's main petrol dump, restored power to the island's hospital and provided shelters for those left homeless by the hurricane [215] [216] The ship arrived in the British Virgin Islands on September 8, 2017, to provide emergency relief to the islands, including providing shelters, food and water [215] HMS Ocean was diverted from the Mediterranean to provide relief from Gibraltar to the affected British Overseas Territories of Anguilla, British Virgin Islands and Turks and Caicos on September 7, [217] and aid was also supplied by the Department for International Development from their disaster response center at Kemble Airfield As part of a £32 million operation named Operation Ruman, nearly 500 UK military personnel with emergency relief were dispatched from RAF Brize Norton [218] This included the first deployment of No 38 Expeditionary Air Wing with three RAF aircraft: two Airbus A400M Atlas and one C-130J Hercules to support relief efforts.\n\n\nThe Bahamas\nBy the afternoon of September 9, Bahamas Power and Light Company had dispatched crews across the archipelago to repair infrastructure damage The southernmost islands, which were most severely affected by

More than 422,000 people were left without water due to 28 aqueducts being damaged [236]\n\n\nUnited States territories\nIn the USVI, residents and tourists alike were described as being in a state of traumatic shock [156] By September 7, the USS Wasp amphibious assault ship had arrived in the USVI to provide supplies, damage assessment, and evacuation assistance Four additional warships, some of which had already been on their way to Texas to assist with Hurricane Harvey relief, were redirected to the region [207] At a September 10 news conference, Governor Kenneth Mapp described Irma as a \"horrific disaster\" for which \" [t]here will be no restorations or solutions in days or weeks.\" The Federal Emergency Management Agency airlifted in goods for residents, who were subjected to a curfew Norwegian Cruise Lines and Royal Caribbean Cruise Line agreed to transport tourists to Florida, contingent upon port availability following the state's own experience with Irma [238]\n\n\nSaint Martin and French Overseas Department\nDamage to Sint Maarten's harbor and to Princess Juliana International Airport left the Dutch part of Saint Martin unreachable, although the smaller Grand Case-Espérance Airport on the French side could be reopened by September 7 for supply aid by helicopter and airplane [243] The French armed forces based in Guadeloupe and French Guiana flew equipment and troops on board a CASA/IPTN CN-235 aircraft.\n\n\nFlorida\nSporadic reports of looting and burglaries at several Miami Metro area businesses occurred with the theft of non-essential items such as sports apparel and athletic shoes during the height of the storm [247] [248]\n\n\nRecords\nIrma set multiple records for intensity, especially at easterly longitudes, time spent at such an intensity, and its intensity at landfall When Irma reached Category 5 intensity with winds of 175 mph (282 km/h) at 11:45 UTC on September 5 at 57.7°W, [6] it became the easternmost Atlantic hurricane of this strength on record, surpassing Hurricane David of 1979, later beaten by Hurricane Lorenzo 2 years later [266] By 00:15 UTC on September 6, Irma reached peak intensity with 180 mph (285 km/h) winds and a minimum pressure of 914 mbar (914 hPa; 27.0 inHg) This ties it with Hurricane Mitch of 1998 and Hurricane Rita of 2005 as the sixth-strongest Atlantic hurricane by wind speed Only five other Atlantic hurricanes have been recorded with wind speeds higher than Irma: Hurricane Allen of 1980, which had maximum sustained winds of 190 mph (310 km/h), and the 1935 Labor Day hurricane, Hurricane Gilbert of 1988, Hurricane Wilma of 2005, and Hurricane Dorian of 2019, all of which had peak winds of 185 mph (298 km/h) [267] At the time, Irma was also the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean outside the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico; later surpassed by Hurricane Dorian, [268] and was the strongest Atlantic hurricane since Wilma in terms of maximum sustained winds, and the most intense in terms of pressure since Dean in 2007 [269] In addition, Irma achieved one of the longest durations of Category 5 strength winds, [6] and the third-highest accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) index for a tropical cyclone in the Atlantic basin, with a value of 64.9 units Only the 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane and Hurricane Ivan in 2004 achieved higher values [270] [271]\n\n\nRetirement\nBecause of the extensive damage and loss of life the hurricane caused in the northeastern Caribbean and the United States, particularly in Florida, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name Irma from its rotating naming lists in April 2018; it will never again be used for another Atlantic hurricane It was replaced with Idalia for the 2023 season [278]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Hurricane Irma\n\nHurricane Irma was a powerful and destructive tropical cyclone that affected several islands in the Caribbean and the southeastern United States in September 2017. The storm is considered one of the most intense Atlantic hurricanes on record, causing widespread damage and loss of life in its path.\n\n**Meteorological History**\n\nThe National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring a tropical wave over western Africa on August 26, 2017. The wave developed into a tropical depression just west of the Cape Verde Islands early on August 31, becoming Tropical Storm Irma shortly afterwards. Under favorable conditions, Irma underwent rapid intensification, becoming a major hurricane on September 1. Within a 48-hour period, the hurricane's intensity had increased by 65 mph (105 km/h).\n\nFluctuations occurred over the next few days due to internal processes, as The first aircraft reconnaissance mission discovered an eye 29 mi (47 km) in diameter and surface winds of 115 mph (185 km/h) on September 3. The NHC reported that Irma was a Category 5 hurricane, with sustained winds of 185 mph (298 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 914 mbar (914 hPa; 27.0 inHg).\n\n**Preparations**\n\nGiven that Irma's forecast track was along much of the Caribbean island chain, hurricane warnings were issued for the northern Leeward Islands, Puerto Rico, and parts of Hispaniola on September 5. The storm's potential impact led to evacuations in several areas, including the Florida Keys, where residents were ordered to leave the islands.\n\n**Caribbean**\n\nHurricane Irma's path was such that its impact was both far-reaching and devastating, with landfalls in Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Martin, the Bahamas, Cuba, and the United States, all at major hurricane intensity. Furthermore, the size of the storm system meant that destruction was prevalent even in territories well removed from landfall occurrences. Irma is the second-costliest Caribbean hurricane on record, after Maria.\n\n**Antigua and Barbuda**\n\nIn response to Hurricane Jose's approach, the Government of Antigua and Barbuda issued a mandatory evacuation on September 9 for any remaining residents on Barbuda. A Miami cargo plane landed on Antigua later that day, carrying over 60 tons (120,000 lbs) of relief supplies for the displaced storm victims—including bottled water, canned food, and power generators.\n\n**Saint Martin**\n\nOn the morning of September 6, Irma's center crossed the island of Saint Martin while the storm was at peak intensity, sweeping away entire structures, submerging roads and cars, and triggering an island-wide blackout.

President Danilo Medina ordered further evacuations due to at-risk dams, while the government banned swimming in rivers and ordered boats kept in port.\n\n**Turks and Caicos Islands**\n\nOn the evening of September 7, at 7:30 p.m. AST (23:30 UTC), Hurricane Irma reached the Turks and Caicos Islands. While the eye passed just south of the main islands, crossing over South Caicos and the Ambergris Cays, the most powerful winds on the northern side of the eye swept all of the islands for more than two hours. Communications infrastructure was destroyed.\n\n**The Bahamas**\n\nBy the afternoon of September 9, Bahamas Power and Light Company had dispatched crews across the archipelago to repair infrastructure damage. The southernmost islands, which were most severely affected by Irma's eye, remained largely inaccessible for days. Assessments showed that 15% of the national telecommunications network had been affected, with at least one tower destroyed.\n\n**Cuba**\n\nSwollen rivers contributed to worsening flooding in the days after the storm system left, resulting in additional evacuations. Officials resorted to using inflatable rafts to access affected areas. The national electrical infrastructure was said to be extensively damaged.\n\n**Mainland United States**\n\nHurricane Irma affected multiple states in the South, especially Florida. Except for the Florida Keys, the total damage Irma caused was not as great as government officials and forecasters had warned.

The United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres expressed his solidarity with the affected countries and pledged support for relief efforts. The European Union activated its emergency response mechanism to provide assistance to the affected countries.\n\n**Economic Impact**\n\nThe economic impact of Hurricane Irma was significant. The storm caused widespread damage and destruction in several countries, disrupting trade and commerce. The total cost of the damage was estimated to be in the billions of dollars.\n\n**Retirement**\n\nBecause of the extensive damage and loss of life the hurricane caused in the northeastern Caribbean and the United States, particularly in Florida, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name Irma from its rotating naming lists in April 2018.

during the height of the storm [247] [248]\n\n\nElsewhere\nGeorgia Governor Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency initially for all six coastal counties on September 6, but eventually expanded the declaration to 94 counties south of Atlanta metropolitan area, and then the entire state on September 10 Atlanta was placed under its first-ever tropical storm warning [55] [56] Governor Deal ordered mandatory evacuations for all areas east of Interstate 95 on September 7, before extending the order to the entirety of Chatham County and low-lying areas west of I-95 on the following day [57] In total, 540,000 people on the Georgia coast were ordered to leave [58] Contraflow lane reversal for Interstate 16 took effect on the morning of September 9 from Savannah to Dublin, Georgia [59] All Georgia state parks were open for free to evacuees, as was the 800-acre camping area at Atlanta Motor Speedway [60] Reversible HOT lanes on Interstate 75 in Georgia through south metro Atlanta were open 24 hours northbound with no tolls [61]\n\n\nSports\nIn professional sports, the Miami Dolphins–Tampa Bay Buccaneers game scheduled for September 10 at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami was postponed to November 19 due to the storm's threat The Dolphins left early for their road game against the Los Angeles Chargers [68] The Tampa Bay Rays and New York Yankees moved their September 11–13 series from Tropicana Field in St Petersburg to Citi Field in Queens [68] Minor League Baseball's Florida State League, Carolina League, and Southern League called off their championship finals and as a result, named their division series winners league co-champions [69] [70] [71] The Miami FC versus San Francisco Deltas match on September 10 was canceled so the players and staff could prepare for the storm with their families [72] The Orlando Pride of the National Women's Soccer League rescheduled their September 9 match to September 7 [73] Orlando City SC of Major League Soccer did not have any scheduled home games in September, but was unable to return to training facilities in Orlando due to Hurricane Irma [74]\n\n\nFEMA funding\nAs of September 5, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) funding was running dangerously low, due to its response to Hurricane Harvey in Texas the previous week, prompting the Trump administration to request an immediate $8 billion in additional funding as Irma approached Florida [79] Given the rate that current funds are being consumed and the catastrophic damage, the United States Senate almost doubled the requested amount to $15.3 billion, with the understanding that this would only be about 10% of what will be required for responding to Harvey [80]\n\n\nImpact\nHurricane Irma's path was such that its impact was both far-reaching and

generators [213]\n\n\nSaint Martin\nOn the morning of September 6, Irma's center crossed the island of Saint Martin while the storm was at peak intensity, sweeping away entire structures, submerging roads and cars, and triggering an island-wide blackout [98] Irma's extreme winds ripped trees out of the ground and sent vehicles and debris from damaged structures scattered across the territory On the French side of Saint-Martin, entire marinas around Marigot were left in ruins, littered with the stranded remnants of boats that had smashed into each other [99] A hotel caught on fire, but dangerous conditions and impassable roads prevented firefighters from putting out the blaze Another hotel lost nearly all of its ground floor [100] Media images depicted devastated room interiors with furniture hurled around after the winds had shattered their windows [99] Irma killed four people on the French side of the island and injured 50 others, one of whom was in critical condition As many as 95% of the buildings there were damaged to some degree; 60% of those were totally uninhabitable [101] Estimates from CEDIM indicate a minimum of $950 million worth of economic losses [81] Total losses exceeded €3.5 billion (US$4.17 billion) [86]\n\n\nSaint Barthélemy\nIrma left widespread destruction and disastrous flooding along its path over the French island of Saint Barthélemy, southeast of Saint Martin Describing the extent of the destruction, one local compared it to \"a bomb that burned all vegetation,\" while another said that it were as if the hurricane had effectively \"erased the island from the map\" [108] Violent seas swept away entire coastal establishments, with one hotel being stripped of all but its foundation [109] Streets in the capital of Gustavia were turned into rushing rivers, which carried away vehicles and pieces of furniture The island's fire station was inundated with up to 6.4 ft (2.0 m) of flood waters [109] [110] With scores of homes and much of the infrastructure destroyed, the majority of the island's population was left stranded and without water, electricity or phone service [108] The associated economic losses could exceed $480 million according to CEDIM's analysts [81]\n\n\nAnguilla\nThe British Overseas Territory of Anguilla saw the eyewall of the storm pass over it on September 6 Many homes and schools were destroyed, and the island's only hospital was badly damaged [6] The devastation was particularly severe in East End, where the winds uprooted scores of trees and power poles and demolished a number of houses In The Valley, the island's capital, the hurricane blew out the windows of government buildings Rough seas inflicted heavy damage upon several bays and harbors, and a seaside restaurant was completely eradicated [113] About 90% of roads were left impassable [6] The island's air traffic control tower was damaged, exacerbating the already poor communication with the island [114] One death was reported on the island Estimates of losses on the island total at least $190 million [6]\n\n\nRest of the Lesser Antilles\nLarge swells ahead of Irma washed ashore debris and sea life in Castries, Saint Lucia, blocking some roads Seaside roads were inundated with water [115] One surfer was killed amid rough surf in Barbados after hitting a reef and breaking his neck Trees were also destroyed [116] The hurricane's effects, such as violent seas and rattling trees, were intense enough to be detected by seismographs in Guadeloupe Several houses were damaged [117] Around 8,000 households and a water supply network on that island lost power during the storm, leaving several communes in the dark without running water Overall damage was limited to external parts of houses and trees that were blown onto roads and three unmanned ships wrecked by rough seas [20]\n\n\nBritish Virgin Islands\nDamage in the British Virgin Islands was extensive Numerous buildings and roads were destroyed on the island of Tortola, which bore the brunt of the hurricane's core Four people were confirmed dead [6] Along Cane Garden Bay, the storm surge submerged several seaside bars and a gas station Satellite images revealed many of the island's residential zones had been left in ruins [113] The hurricane passed over Necker Island, also causing severe damage and destroying the mansion of Richard Branson [121]\n\n\nU.S. Virgin Islands\nIrma's effects in the U.S Virgin Islands were most profound on Saint Thomas, where at least 12 inches (300 mm) of rain fell, and on Saint John Saint Thomas island suffered widespread structural damage, including to its police station and airport Patients from the fourth and third floors of Charlotte Amalie's hospital had to be relocated to lower floors due to flooding from roof leaks Three deaths were attributed to Irma on the island On nearby Saint Croix, there were communication issues and some damage to the infrastructure [113] Saint John lost access to ferry and cargo services, along with access to the local airport Due to its normal reliance on electricity from Saint Thomas, the island was left without power [125] [126] [127] [128] Total damage from the three islands was at least $1.1 billion.\n\n\nPuerto Rico\nThe hurricane passed north of Puerto Rico, but still caused significant damage to the United States territory Along the coast, a tide gauge observed waves up to 1.5 ft (0.46 m) mean higher high water Much of the main island experienced sustained tropical storm force winds, with a peak sustained wind speed of 55 mph (89 km/h) at a weather station along San Juan Bay, while the same site observed a peak wind gust of 74 mph (119 km/h) [6] However, on the island of Culebra, a wind gust of 111 mph (179 km/h) was reported [129] Mainly due to strong winds, approximately 1.1 million out of 1.5 million of Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority's customers lost electricity [130] Portions of Puerto Rico received heavy rainfall, with a peak total of 13.04 in (331 mm) in Bayamón, [6] causing seven rivers to reach flood stage, widespread flash flooding, and at least six landslides [130]\n\n\nHispaniola\nIn the Dominican Republic, flooding worsened following Irma's departure, leading the number of displaced persons to increase to more than 24,000 by September 8 President Danilo Medina ordered further evacuations due to at-risk dams, while the government banned swimming in rivers and ordered boats kept in port [235] More than 422,000 people were left without water due to 28 aqueducts being damaged [236]\n\n\nTurks and Caicos Islands\nOn the evening of September 7, at 7:30 p.m AST (23:30 UTC), Hurricane Irma reached the Turks and Caicos Islands While the eye passed just south of the main islands, crossing over South Caicos and the Ambergris Cays, the most powerful winds on the northern side of the eye swept all of the islands for more than two hours Communications infrastructure was destroyed [6]\n\n\nThe Bahamas\nBy the afternoon of September 9, Bahamas Power and Light Company had dispatched crews across the archipelago to repair infrastructure damage The southernmost islands, which were most severely affected by Irma's eye, remained largely inaccessible for days [227] Assessments showed that 15% of the national telecommunications network had been affected, with at least one tower destroyed [228] Bahamasair resumed a limited domestic schedule on September 10, with international flights still canceled due to existing and anticipated destruction at other destinations [229]\n\n\nCuba\nSwollen rivers contributed to worsening flooding in the days after the storm system left, resulting in additional evacuations Officials resorted to using inflatable rafts to access affected areas The national electrical infrastructure was said to be extensively damaged [156]\n\n\nMainland United States\nHurricane Irma affected multiple states in the South, especially Florida Except for the Florida Keys, the total damage Irma caused was not as great as government officials and forecasters had warned Irma weakened after making landfall in Cuba, but strengthened back into a Category 4 prior to hitting the Keys The Florida Keys suffered the worst of the damage in the United States After surveying the aftermath of Irma, Florida governor Rick Scott said \"I thought we would see more damage\"  [on the mainland] but said \"he witnessed devastation in the Keys\" [161] President Donald Trump commented on Twitter that the devastation in some places was \"far greater than anyone thought\" [162]\n\n\nFlorida\nSporadic reports of looting and burglaries at several Miami Metro area businesses occurred with the theft of non-essential items such as sports apparel and athletic shoes during the height of the storm [247] [248]\n\n\nOther states\nThree deaths were reported in Georgia due to falling trees and debris, along with widespread wind damage and power outages throughout the state primarily due to fallen trees [196] On Tybee Island, as well as St Simons Island the storm surge caused extensive flooding [197] [198] The tropical storm also did $54 million in damage in the state [199]\n\n\nAftermath\nIn the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Irma's path through the West Indies and Caribbean, the devastation to roads, harbors and airports significantly impeded the transportation and distribution of relief supplies Foreign countries moved to provide much of the initial aid The British, Dutch, French, and United States governments sent warships and planes with supplies and manpower to the region [29] [207] International leaders, including Dutch King Willem-Alexander and French President Emmanuel Macron, quickly moved to visit affected territories [208] [209]\n\n\nAntigua and Barbuda\nIn response to Hurricane Jose's approach, the Government of Antigua and Barbuda issued a mandatory evacuation on September 9 for any remaining residents on Barbuda A Miami cargo plane landed on Antigua later that day, carrying over 60 tons (120,000 lbs) of relief supplies for the displaced storm victims—including bottled water, canned food and power generators [213]\n\n\nBritish Overseas Territories\nRFA Mounts Bay stationed itself near Anguilla and provided support and relief work to the island with its helicopters and 40 marines and army engineers [214] The ship delivered 6 tonnes of emergency aid to Anguilla and army engineers repaired a fuel leak at Anguilla's main petrol dump, restored power to the island's hospital and provided shelters for those left homeless by the hurricane [215] [216] The ship arrived in the British Virgin Islands on September 8, 2017, to provide emergency relief to the islands, including providing shelters, food and water [215] HMS Ocean was diverted from the Mediterranean to provide relief from Gibraltar to the affected British Overseas Territories of Anguilla, British Virgin Islands and Turks and Caicos on September 7, [217] and aid was also supplied by the Department for International Development from their disaster response center at Kemble Airfield As part of a £32 million operation named Operation Ruman, nearly 500 UK military personnel with emergency relief were dispatched from RAF Brize Norton [218] This included the first deployment of No 38 Expeditionary Air Wing with three RAF aircraft: two Airbus A400M Atlas and one C-130J Hercules to support relief efforts.\n\n\nThe Bahamas\nBy the afternoon of September 9, Bahamas Power and Light Company had dispatched crews across the archipelago to repair infrastructure damage The southernmost islands, which were most severely affected by Irma's eye, remained largely inaccessible for days [227] Assessments showed that 15% of the national telecommunications network had been affected, with at least one tower destroyed [228] Bahamasair resumed a limited domestic schedule on September 10, with international flights still canceled due to existing and anticipated destruction at other destinations [229]\n\n\nCuba\nSwollen rivers contributed to worsening flooding in the days after the storm system left, resulting in additional

to at-risk dams, while the government banned swimming in rivers and ordered boats kept in port [235] More than 422,000 people were left without water due to 28 aqueducts being damaged [236]\n\n\nUnited States territories\nIn the USVI, residents and tourists alike were described as being in a state of traumatic shock [156] By September 7, the USS Wasp amphibious assault ship had arrived in the USVI to provide supplies, damage assessment, and evacuation assistance Four additional warships, some of which had already been on their way to Texas to assist with Hurricane Harvey relief, were redirected to the region [207] At a September 10 news conference, Governor Kenneth Mapp described Irma as a \"horrific disaster\" for which \" [t]here will be no restorations or solutions in days or weeks.\" The Federal Emergency Management Agency airlifted in goods for residents, who were subjected to a curfew Norwegian Cruise Lines and Royal Caribbean Cruise Line agreed to transport tourists to Florida, contingent upon port availability following the state's own experience with Irma [238]\n\n\nSaint Martin and French Overseas Department\nDamage to Sint Maarten's harbor and to Princess Juliana International Airport left the Dutch part of Saint Martin unreachable, although the smaller Grand Case-Espérance Airport on the French side could be reopened by September 7 for supply aid by helicopter and airplane [243] The French armed forces based in Guadeloupe and French Guiana flew equipment and troops on board a CASA/IPTN CN-235 aircraft.\n\n\nFlorida\nSporadic reports of looting and burglaries at several Miami Metro area businesses occurred with the theft of non-essential items such as sports apparel and athletic shoes during the height of the storm [247] [248]\n\n\nRecords\nIrma set multiple records for intensity, especially at easterly longitudes, time spent at such an intensity, and its intensity at landfall When Irma reached Category 5 intensity with winds of 175 mph (282 km/h) at 11:45 UTC on September 5 at 57.7°W, [6] it became the easternmost Atlantic hurricane of this strength on record, surpassing Hurricane David of 1979, later beaten by Hurricane Lorenzo 2 years later [266] By 00:15 UTC on September 6, Irma reached peak intensity with 180 mph (285 km/h) winds and a minimum pressure of 914 mbar (914 hPa; 27.0 inHg) This ties it with Hurricane Mitch of 1998 and Hurricane Rita of 2005 as the sixth-strongest Atlantic hurricane by wind speed Only five other Atlantic hurricanes have been recorded with wind speeds higher than Irma: Hurricane Allen of 1980, which had maximum sustained winds of 190 mph (310 km/h), and the 1935 Labor Day hurricane, Hurricane Gilbert of 1988, Hurricane Wilma of 2005, and Hurricane Dorian of 2019, all of which had peak winds of 185 mph (298 km/h) [267] At the time, Irma was also the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean outside the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico; later surpassed by Hurricane Dorian, [268] and was the strongest Atlantic hurricane since Wilma in terms of maximum sustained winds, and the most intense in terms of pressure since Dean in 2007 [269] In addition, Irma achieved one of the longest durations of Category 5 strength winds, [6] and the third-highest accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) index for a tropical cyclone in the Atlantic basin, with a value of 64.9 units Only the 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane and Hurricane Ivan in 2004 achieved higher values [270] [271]\n\n\nRetirement\nBecause of the extensive damage and loss of life the hurricane caused in the northeastern Caribbean and the United States, particularly in Florida, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name Irma from its rotating naming lists in April 2018; it will never again be used for another Atlantic hurricane It was replaced with Idalia for the 2023 season [278]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

MAJ Colin Powell, a recently assigned Deputy G3, investigated the allegations described in the  [Glen] letter He proved unable to uncover either wide-spread unnecessary killings, war crimes, or any facts related to My Lai ...\n\nAfter the Vietnam War\nWhen he returned to the U.S from Vietnam in 1971, Powell earned a Master of Business Administration degree from George Washington University in Washington, D.C [20] [31] He later served a White House Fellowship under President Richard Nixon from 1972 to 1973 During 1975–1976 he attended the National War College, Washington, D.C [41]\n\n\nNational Security Advisor and other advisory roles\nPowell retained his role as the now-senior military assistant\n\n\nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff\nPowell's last military assignment, from October 1, 1989, to September 30, 1993, was as the 12th chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the highest military position in the Department of Defense At age 52, he became the youngest officer, and first Afro-Caribbean American, to serve in this position Powell was also the first JCS chair who received his commission through ROTC [56]\n\n\nNational Security Advisor and

nominee, [79] Powell eventually declared himself a Republican and began to campaign for Republican candidates in 1995 [80] [81] He was touted as a possible opponent of Bill Clinton in the 1996 U.S presidential election, possibly capitalizing on a split conservative vote in Iowa [82] and even leading New Hampshire polls for the GOP nomination, [83] but Powell declined, citing a lack of passion for politics [84] Powell defeated Clinton 50–38 in a hypothetical match-up proposed to voters in the exit polls conducted on Election Day [85] Despite not standing in the race, Powell won the

on write-in votes [86]\n\n\nSecretary of State (2001–2005)\nPresident-elect George W Bush named Powell as his nominee to be secretary of state in a ceremony at his ranch in Crawford, Texas on December 16, 2000 [93] This made Powell the first person to formally accept a Cabinet post in the Bush administration, [93] [94] as well the first black United States secretary of state [12] As secretary of state, Powell was perceived as moderate Powell was unanimously confirmed by the United States Senate by voice vote on January 20, 2001, [95] and ceremonially sworn in on January 26 [96] [97] Over the course of his tenure he traveled less than any other U.S Secretary of State in thirty years [98] This is partly attributed to a letter from former diplomat George F Kennan, who advised Powell to focus on his duties as the president's principal foreign policy advisor and avoid trips that risked undercutting the duties of the ambassadors [99]\n\n\n2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq\nMy second purpose today is .. to share with you what the United States knows about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction .. Iraq's behavior demonstrate that Saddam Hussein and his regime have made no effort .. to disarm as required by the international community Indeed, the facts and Iraq's behavior show that Saddam Hussein and his regime are concealing their efforts to produce more weapons of mass destruction .. every statement I make today is backed up by sources, solid sources These are not assertions What we're giving you are facts and conclusions based on solid intelligence.\n\nOther foreign policy issues\nAdditionally, Powell was critical of other aspects of U.S foreign policy in the past, such as its support for the 1973 Chilean coup d'état that deposed the democratically elected president Salvador Allende in favor of Augusto Pinochet From two separate interviews in 2003, Powell stated in one about the 1973 event: \"I can't justify or explain the actions and decisions that were made at that time It was a different time There was a great deal of concern about communism in this part of the world Communism was a threat to the democracies in this part of the world It was a threat to the United States.\" [124] In another interview, he also simply stated: \"With respect to your earlier comment about Chile in the 1970s and what happened with Mr Allende, it is not a part of American history that we're proud of.\" [125]\n\n\nLife after diplomatic service\nAfter retiring from the role of Secretary of State, Powell returned to private life In April 2005, he was privately telephoned by Republican senators Lincoln Chafee and Chuck Hagel, [131] at which time Powell expressed reservations and mixed reviews about the nomination of John Bolton as ambassador to the United Nations, but refrained from advising the senators to oppose Bolton (Powell had clashed with Bolton during Bush's first term) [132] The decision was viewed as potentially dealing significant damage to Bolton's chances of confirmation Bolton was put into the position via a recess appointment because of the strong opposition in the Senate [133]\n\n\nPolitical positions\nDuring his early political career through his tenure within the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Powell was an independent Powell was a moderate Republican from 1995 until 2021 Many have described Powell as a neoconservative for his foreign policy positions, although Powell never personally acknowledged the label In 2021, Powell recanted his status as a Republican following the January 6 United States Capitol attack The attack moved Powell to call for president Trump's resignation, noting: \"I wish he would do what Nixon did and just step down Somebody ought to go up to him and it's over.\" Powell also accused Trump of attempting to \"overthrow the government\", and that Trump's false claims of a stolen election were \"dangerous for our democracy\" [142] [143] Powell was pro-choice regarding abortion, [144] and expressed some support for an assault weapons ban [145] He stated in his autobiography that he supported affirmative action that levels the playing field, without giving a leg up to undeserving persons because of racial issues Powell originally suggested the don't ask, don't tell policy to President Clinton, [146] though he later supported its repeal as proposed by Robert Gates and Admiral Mike Mullen in January 2010, saying \"circumstances had changed\" [147]\n\n\nDefending the Iraq War\nAt the 2007 Aspen Ideas Festival in Colorado, [150] Powell stated that he had spent two and a half hours explaining to President Bush \"the consequences of going into an Arab country and becoming the occupiers\" During this discussion, he insisted that the U.S appeal to the United Nations first, but if diplomacy failed, he would support the invasion: \"I also had to say to him that you are the President, you will have to make the ultimate judgment, and if the judgment is this isn't working and we don't think it is going to solve the problem, then if military action is undertaken I'm with you, I support you.\" [151]\n\n\nEndorsement of Barack Obama\nPowell donated the maximum allowable amount to John McCain's campaign in the summer of 2007 [155] and in early 2008, his name was listed as a possible running mate for Republican nominee McCain's bid during the 2008 U.S presidential election [156]\n\n\nViews on the Obama administration\nIn a July 2009 CNN interview with John King, Powell expressed concern over President Obama increasing the size of the federal government and the size of the federal budget deficit [162] In September 2010, he criticized the Obama administration for not focusing \"like a razor blade\" on the economy and job creation Powell reiterated that Obama was a \"transformational figure.\" [163] In a video that aired on CNN.com in November 2011, Colin Powell said in reference to Barack Obama, \"many of his decisions have been quite sound The financial system was put back on a stable basis.\" [164]\n\n\n2016 e-mail leaks and criticism of Donald Trump\nPowell was very vocal on the state of the Republican Party Speaking at a Washington Ideas forum in early October 2015, he warned the audience that the Republican Party had begun a move to the fringe right, lessening the chances of a Republican White House in the future He also remarked on Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's statements regarding immigrants, noting that there were many immigrants working in Trump hotels [167]\n\n\nViews on the Trump administration\nIn an interview in October 2019, Powell warned that the GOP needed to \"get a grip\" and put the country before their party, standing up to then president Trump rather than worrying about political fallout He said: \"When they see things that are not right, they need to say something about it because our foreign policy is in shambles right now, in my humble judgment, and I see things happening that are hard to understand.\" [176] On June 7, 2020, Powell announced he would be voting for former Vice President Joe Biden in the 2020 United States presidential election [177] In August, Powell delivered a speech in support of Biden's candidacy at the 2020 Democratic National Convention [178]\n\n\nPersonal life\nPowell married Alma Johnson on August 25, 1962 Their son, Michael Powell, was the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) from 2001 to 2005 Their daughters are Linda Powell, an actress, and Annemarie Powell Alma died in 2024 [180]\n\n\nDeath\nOn October 18, 2021, Powell, who was being treated for multiple myeloma, [187] died at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center of complications from

is a retired four-star general in the United States Army and a former National Security Adviser, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Secretary of State. He was the first African American to hold these positions. Powell was born on April 5, 1937, in Harlem, New York, to Jamaican immigrants Maud Ariel and Luther Theophilus Powell.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nPowell was raised in the South Bronx and attended the now-closed Morris High School, from which he graduated in 1954. He joined the Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) while attending the City College of New York and received a commission as an Army second lieutenant upon graduation. Powell's early military career was marked by his service in the state of Georgia, where he was refused service in bars and restaurants because of the color of his skin.\n\n**Military Career**\n\nPowell's military career spanned over 35 years, during which he held various command and staff positions and rose to the rank of general. He served as a South Vietnamese Army (ARVN) advisor from 1962 to 1963, where he was wounded by stepping on a punji stake. Powell also served as the Deputy G3 during the My Lai massacre inquiry, where he was unable to uncover any evidence of widespread unnecessary killings or war crimes.\n\n**Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff**\n\nPowell's last military assignment was as the 12th Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the highest military position in the Department of Defense. He was the youngest officer and first Afro-Caribbean American to hold this position. Powell was also the first JCS chair who received his commission through ROTC.\n\n**National Security Advisor and Secretary of State**\n\nAfter leaving the military, Powell served as the National Security Adviser under President Ronald Reagan from 1987 to 1989. He was then appointed as the Secretary of State by President George H.W. Bush in 1989. As Secretary of State, Powell was perceived as moderate and was unanimously confirmed by the United States Senate. He served in this position until 1993.\n\n**Life After Diplomatic Service**\n\nAfter retiring from the role of Secretary of State, Powell returned to private life. He was privately telephoned by Republican senators Lincoln Chafee and Chuck Hagel, where he expressed reservations about the nomination of John Bolton as ambassador to the United Nations. Powell's decision not to advise the senators to oppose Bolton was viewed as potentially dealing significant damage to Bolton's chances of confirmation.\n\n**Political Positions**\n\nPowell was a moderate Republican from 1995 until 2021. Many have described Powell as a neoconservative for his foreign policy positions. In 2021, Powell recanted his status as a Republican following the January 6 United States Capitol attack. He called for President Trump's resignation, noting that his false claims of a stolen election were \"dangerous for our democracy.\"\n\n**Defending the Iraq War**\n\nPowell stated that he had spent two and a half hours explaining to President Bush the consequences of going into an Arab country and becoming the occupiers. He insisted that the U.S appeal to the United Nations first, but if diplomacy failed, he would support the invasion.\n\n**Endorsement of Barack Obama**\n\nPowell donated the maximum allowable amount to John McCain's campaign in the summer of 2007. In early 2008, his name was listed as a possible running mate for Republican nominee McCain's bid during the 2008 U.S presidential election.\n\n**Views on the Trump Administration**\n\nIn an interview in October 2019, Powell warned that the GOP needed to \"get a grip\" and put the country before their party, standing up to then President Trump rather than worrying about political fallout. He stated that the U.S foreign policy was in shambles under the Trump administration.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nPowell married Alma Johnson on August 25, 1962. They had two sons, Michael Powell, and Michael's twin brother, Colin Powell Jr. Their daughters are Linda Powell, an actress, and Annemarie Powell. Alma died in 2024.\n\n**Death**\n\nPowell died on October 18, 2021, at the age of 84, due to complications from COVID-19 and multiple myeloma. He was vaccinated, but his myeloma compromised his immune system. President Joe Biden and four of the five living former presidents issued statements calling Powell an American hero.\n\n**Civilian Awards and Honors**\n\nPowell's civilian awards include two Presidential Medals of Freedom, the Congressional Gold Medal, and the Ronald Reagan Freedom Award.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Colin_Powell\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nColin Luther Powell was born on April 5, 1937, [10] [11] in Harlem, a neighborhood in the New York City borough of Manhattan [12] He was born to Jamaican immigrants Maud Ariel (née McKoy) and Luther Theophilus Powell [12] [13] His parents were both of mixed African and Scottish ancestry [14] [15] Luther worked as a shipping clerk and Maud as a seamstress [16] Powell was raised in the South Bronx and attended the now closed Morris High School, from which he graduated in 1954 [17]\n\n\nMilitary career\nPowell was a professional soldier for thirty-five years, holding a variety of command and staff positions and rising to the rank of general [26]\n\n\nTraining\n\nWhile attending the City College of New York, Powell joined the Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) [27] He described the experience as one of the happiest experiences of his life According to Powell: \n\nEarly career\nUpon graduation, he received a commission as an Army second lieutenant; [30] at this time, the Army was newly desegregated [12] (see: Executive Order 9981) He underwent training in the state of Georgia, where he was refused service in bars and restaurants because of the color of his skin [31] After attending basic training at Fort Benning, Powell was assigned to the 48th Infantry, in West Germany, as a platoon leader [32] From 1960 to 1962, he served as group liaison officer, company executive officer, and commander of Company A, 1st Battle Group, 4th Infantry, 2nd Infantry Brigade, 5th Infantry Division (Mechanized) at Fort Devens, Massachusetts [33]\n\n\nVietnam War\nCaptain Powell served a tour in Vietnam as a South Vietnamese Army (ARVN) advisor from 1962 to 1963 While on patrol in a Viet Cong-held area, he was wounded by stepping on a punji stake [34] The large infection made it difficult for him to walk, and caused his foot to swell for a short time, shortening his first tour [35]\n\n\nMỹ Lai massacre inquiry\nSoldiers actively hunted, herded, and killed elderly people, children, infants, and raped women while other Soldiers  [sic] looked on and did nothing to stop the massacre An estimated 350 to 500 unarmed civilians died in My Lai ..

on write-in votes [86]\n\n\nSecretary of State (2001–2005)\nPresident-elect George W Bush named Powell as his nominee to be secretary of state in a ceremony at his ranch in Crawford, Texas on December 16, 2000 [93] This made Powell the first person to formally accept a Cabinet post in the Bush administration, [93] [94] as well the first black United States secretary of state [12] As secretary of state, Powell was perceived as moderate Powell was unanimously confirmed by the United States Senate by voice vote on January 20, 2001, [95] and ceremonially sworn in on January 26 [96] [97] Over the course of his tenure he traveled less than any other U.S Secretary of State in thirty years [98] This is partly attributed to a letter from former diplomat George F Kennan, who advised Powell to focus on his duties as the president's principal foreign policy advisor and avoid trips that risked undercutting the duties of the ambassadors [99]\n\n\n2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq\nMy second purpose today is .. to share with you what the United States knows about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction .. Iraq's behavior demonstrate that Saddam Hussein and his regime have made no effort .. to disarm as required by the international community Indeed, the facts and Iraq's behavior show that Saddam Hussein and his regime are concealing their efforts to produce more weapons of mass destruction .. every statement I make today is backed up by sources, solid sources These are not assertions What we're giving you are facts and conclusions based on solid intelligence.\n\nOther foreign policy issues\nAdditionally, Powell was critical of other aspects of U.S foreign policy in the past, such as its support for the 1973 Chilean coup d'état that deposed the democratically elected president Salvador Allende in favor of Augusto Pinochet From two separate interviews in 2003, Powell stated in one about the 1973 event: \"I can't justify or explain the actions and decisions that were made at that time It was a different time There was a great deal of concern about communism in this part of the world Communism was a threat to the democracies in this part of the world It was a threat to the United States.\" [124] In another interview, he also simply stated: \"With respect to your earlier comment about Chile in the 1970s and what happened with Mr Allende, it is not a part of American history that we're proud of.\" [125]\n\n\nLife after diplomatic service\nAfter retiring from the role of Secretary of State, Powell returned to private life In April 2005, he was privately telephoned by Republican senators Lincoln Chafee and Chuck Hagel, [131] at which time Powell expressed reservations and mixed reviews about the nomination of John Bolton as ambassador to the United Nations, but refrained from advising the senators to oppose Bolton (Powell had clashed with Bolton during Bush's first term) [132] The decision was viewed as potentially dealing significant damage to Bolton's chances of confirmation Bolton was put into the position via a recess appointment because of the strong opposition in the Senate [133]\n\n\nPolitical positions\nDuring his early political career through his tenure within the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Powell was an independent Powell was a moderate Republican from 1995 until 2021 Many have described Powell as a neoconservative for his foreign policy positions, although Powell never personally acknowledged the label In 2021, Powell recanted his status as a Republican following the January 6 United States Capitol attack The attack moved Powell to call for president Trump's resignation, noting: \"I wish he would do what Nixon did and just step down Somebody ought to go up to him and it's over.\" Powell also accused Trump of attempting to \"overthrow the government\", and that Trump's false claims of a stolen election were \"dangerous for our democracy\" [142] [143] Powell was pro-choice regarding abortion, [144] and expressed some support for an assault weapons ban [145] He stated in his autobiography that he supported affirmative action that levels the playing field, without giving a leg up to undeserving persons because of racial issues Powell originally suggested the don't ask, don't tell policy to President Clinton, [146] though he later supported its repeal as proposed by Robert Gates and Admiral Mike Mullen in January 2010, saying \"circumstances had changed\" [147]\n\n\nDefending the Iraq War\nAt the 2007 Aspen Ideas Festival in Colorado, [150] Powell stated that he had spent two and a half hours explaining to President Bush \"the consequences of going into an Arab country and becoming the occupiers\" During this discussion, he insisted that the U.S appeal to the United Nations first, but if diplomacy failed, he would support the invasion: \"I also had to say to him that you are the President, you will have to make the ultimate judgment, and if the judgment is this isn't working and we don't think it is going to solve the problem, then if military action is undertaken I'm with you, I support you.\" [151]\n\n\nEndorsement of Barack Obama\nPowell donated the maximum allowable amount to John McCain's campaign in the summer of 2007 [155] and in early 2008, his name was listed as a possible running mate for Republican nominee McCain's bid during the 2008 U.S presidential election [156]\n\n\nViews on the Obama administration\nIn a July 2009 CNN interview with John King, Powell expressed concern over President Obama increasing the size of the federal government and the size of the federal budget deficit [162] In September 2010, he criticized the Obama administration for not focusing \"like a razor blade\" on the economy and job creation Powell reiterated that Obama was a \"transformational figure.\" [163] In a video that aired on CNN.com in November 2011, Colin Powell said in reference to Barack Obama, \"many of his decisions have been quite sound The financial system was put back on a stable basis.\" [164]\n\n\n2016 e-mail leaks and criticism of Donald Trump\nPowell was very vocal on the state of the Republican Party Speaking at a Washington Ideas forum in early October 2015, he warned the audience that the Republican Party had begun a move to the fringe right, lessening the chances of a Republican White House in the future He also remarked on Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's statements regarding immigrants, noting that there were many immigrants working in Trump hotels [167]\n\n\nViews on the Trump administration\nIn an interview in October 2019, Powell warned that the GOP needed to \"get a grip\" and put the country before their party, standing up to then president Trump rather than worrying about political fallout He said: \"When they see things that are not right, they need to say something about it because our foreign policy is in shambles right now, in my humble judgment, and I see things happening that are hard to understand.\" [176] On June 7, 2020, Powell announced he would be voting for former Vice President Joe Biden in the 2020 United States presidential election [177] In August, Powell delivered a speech in support of Biden's candidacy at the 2020 Democratic National Convention [178]\n\n\nPersonal life\nPowell married Alma

Powell Alma died in 2024 [180]\n\n\nDeath\nOn October 18, 2021, Powell, who was being treated for multiple myeloma, [187] died at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center of complications from COVID-19 at the age of 84 [188] He had been vaccinated, but his myeloma compromised his immune system; he also had early-stage Parkinson's disease [12] [189] President Joe Biden and four of the five living former presidents issued statements calling Powell an American hero Donald Trump released a statement saying \"He made plenty of mistakes, but anyway, may he rest in peace!\" and referred to him as a \"classic RINO\" [190] [191] [192]\n\n\nCivilian awards and honors\nPowell's civilian awards include two Presidential Medals of Freedom (the second with distinction), the Congressional Gold Medal, and the Ronald Reagan Freedom Award.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The case drew widespread media attention and raised questions about the extent to which individuals can deceive others and the consequences of such actions.\n\n# Background\n\nJohn Darwin was born in 1950 or 1951 in the United Kingdom. He attended St Francis Xavier's Grammar School in Hartlepool and later studied biology and chemistry at De La Salle College in Salford. Little is known about Darwin's life before his disappearance, but it is reported that he worked as a teacher before abandoning his career and kayak sailing.\n\n# Disappearance\n\nOn 21 March 2002, John Darwin was seen paddling out to sea in his kayak at Seaton Carew, a coastal town in northeast England. Later that day, he was reported missing after failing to report to work. A large-scale search operation was launched, involving the coastguard, police, and other emergency services. The search covered an area of 62 square miles of coastline, but no sign of Darwin was found.\n\nThe following day, a double-ended paddle and the wreckage of Darwin's kayak were discovered, but there was no sign of Darwin himself. Rescuers were puzzled by the circumstances of his disappearance, as the North Sea was unusually calm on the day in question. The lack of evidence and the unusual circumstances of the disappearance led the authorities to believe that Darwin had probably drowned.\n\n# Missing Years\n\nDuring the years that Darwin was presumed dead, he lived in secret with his family. It is reported that he initially lived in a bedsit next door to the family home, but later moved back in with his wife, Anne, in February 2003. Meanwhile, a death certificate was issued stating that Darwin had died on 21 March 2002, which allowed his wife to claim his life insurance. It is alleged that £250,000 was paid out from Unat Direct Insurance Management Limited, part of the AIG insurance group.\n\nSome time that year, a tenant of the Darwins' block of bedsit flats recognized Darwin and asked him, \"Aren't you supposed to be dead?\" to which Darwin replied, \"Don't tell anyone about this.\" The tenant did not report this to the police, reportedly because he \"did not want to get involved.\"\n\n# Return and Arrest\n\nIn June 2007, Darwin emailed his wife to notify her that their identities would have to be verified by UK police in order for them to receive now-required Panamanian \"investors' visas.\" Knowing that his \"John Jones\" alias would not pass this level of scrutiny, Darwin decided to return to the UK under his real name and fake amnesia.\n\nDarwin's return to the UK was facilitated by a change in Panama's visa laws, which required individuals to undergo identity verification. When Darwin's wife, Anne, was questioned by the police about her husband's plans to return, she reportedly told them that she had no knowledge of his intentions.\n\n# Trial\n\nOn 14 June 2007, John Darwin returned to the UK and was arrested at Durham Tees Valley Airport. He was charged with insurance fraud and making false statements to obtain a passport. His wife, Anne, was arrested the following day at Manchester Airport and was detained in connection with the allegations of fraud.\n\nAnne Darwin was charged with two counts of fraud: obtaining £25,000 and £137,000 by deception. She remained in custody until 14 December, when she appeared in court to face the charges. John Darwin also appeared in court on 10 December, where he was remanded in custody until 14 December.\n\n# Sentencing\n\nOn 23 July 2008, John and Anne Darwin were both convicted of fraud. John Darwin faced an additional charge relating to his fake passport and was sentenced to six years and three months in prison.
