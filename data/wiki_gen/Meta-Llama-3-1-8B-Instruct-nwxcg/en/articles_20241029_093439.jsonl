However, I can give you a general outline of what such an article might look like and provide some information on Dost Mohammad Khan.\n\nDost Mohammad Khan was a prominent leader in Afghanistan in the early 19th century. Here's a brief overview of his life and reign:\n\n**Introduction**\n\nDost Mohammad Khan was a Pashtun ruler who played a significant role in Afghan history during the early 19th century. He is best known for his efforts to unify Afghanistan and resist foreign invasions. Born in 1793, Dost Mohammad Khan rose to power after the death of his predecessor, Fateh Khan, and went on to rule Afghanistan for over three decades. His reign was marked by a series of wars with neighboring countries, including the Sikhs and the British, as well as internal power struggles.\n\n**Background and rise to power**\n\nDost Mohammad Khan was born in 1793 in the village of Khvaja Baba, near Kabul. He was the son of a Pashtun tribal leader and was educated in Islamic studies and military tactics. After the death of his predecessor, Fateh Khan, in 1823, Dost Mohammad Khan seized power and began to consolidate his position as the leader of Afghanistan. He quickly established a strong military presence and began to expand his control over the surrounding territories.\n\n**European influence in Afghanistan**\n\nDuring the early 19th century, European powers, including Britain and Russia, began to take an interest in Afghanistan as a strategic location for trade and military expansion. Dost Mohammad Khan was aware of the potential threats posed by European powers and attempted to maintain a balance of power by playing off one against the other. He formed alliances with both the British and the Russians, but ultimately, he was forced to make concessions to the British in order to maintain his independence.\n\n**War with the Sikhs**\n\nIn the 1830s, Dost Mohammad Khan went to war with the Sikhs, who were a powerful military force in the region. The war was sparked by a series of border disputes and ended in a decisive victory for the Sikhs. The war had a significant impact on Afghanistan, as it weakened Dost Mohammad Khan's position and allowed the Sikhs to gain control over a significant portion of Afghan territory.\n\n**Second reign**\n\nAfter a period of exile, Dost Mohammad Khan returned to power in 1843 and began a second reign. During this period, he faced significant challenges, including the rise of the British in India and the growing power of the Russian Empire. Despite these challenges, he was able to maintain his independence and expand his control over the surrounding territories.\n\n### Conquest of the Balkh Wilayat\n\nOne of Dost Mohammad Khan's most significant military campaigns during his second reign was the conquest of the Balkh Wilayat. The Balkh Wilayat was a strategic region located in northern Afghanistan, and its conquest gave Dost Mohammad Khan control over the region's fertile valleys and important trade routes.\n\n### Alliance with the British\n\nIn the 1850s, Dost Mohammad Khan formed an alliance with the British, who were expanding their control over India. The alliance was motivated by a shared desire to resist Russian expansion in the region, but it ultimately proved to be a strategic mistake for Dost Mohammad Khan. The British eventually turned against him and forced him to sign the Treaty of Gandamak in 1855, which ceded significant territory to the British.\n\n### Conquest of Herat and Death\n\nIn the late 1850s, Dost Mohammad Khan launched a campaign to conquer the city of Herat, which was a strategic location in western Afghanistan. He was ultimately unsuccessful in his efforts, and the city remained under the control of the British-backed governor, Sultan Muhammad. Dost Mohammad Khan died in 1863, marking the end of an era in Afghan history.\n\n**Gallery**\n\n* [Image of Dost Mohammad Khan]\n* [Map of Afghanistan during Dost Mohammad Khan's reign]\n* [Image of the Balkh Wilayat]\n* [Image of the Treaty of Gandamak]\n\n**See also**\n\n* Afghan history\n* Pashtun history\n* European influence in Afghanistan\n* British Empire\n* Russian Empire\n\n**References**\n\n* [Sources]\n\n**External links**\n\n* [Online encyclopedia articles about Dost Mohammad Khan]\n* [Historical websites and resources about Afghanistan]\n* [Images and maps of Afghanistan during Dost Mohammad Khan's reign]", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Dost_Mohammad_Khan\" following this outline:\n\n#Background and rise to power\n#European influence in Afghanistan\n#War with the Sikhs\n#Second reign\n##Conquest of the Balkh Wilayat\n##Alliance with the British\n##Conquest of Herat and Death\n#Gallery\n#See also\n#References\n##Sources\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He was the third of four children, and his family lived in the La Bajada neighborhood. Messi's father, a steelworker, had to work multiple jobs to support the family, and his mother was a part-time cleaner. Despite the family's modest financial situation, Messi's parents encouraged his passion for football from a young age.\n\n#Youth career\n##Newell's Old Boys (1995-2000)\nAt the age of eight, Messi joined the local club Grandoli, where he spent three years before being scouted by Newell's Old Boys, a prominent Argentine club. He joined Newell's Old Boys' youth academy, where he quickly impressed coaches with his exceptional dribbling skills and speed. Messi's talent earned him a spot on Newell's Old Boys' first team, where he made his professional debut at the age of 13.\n\n##Barcelona (2000-2004)\nIn 2000, Barcelona signed Messi to their youth academy, La Masia, after seeing him play for Newell's Old Boys.

He continued to play for PSG until July 2023, when he left the club to join Inter Miami.\n\n##Inter Miami (2023-present)\nIn July 2023, Messi joined Inter Miami, signing a three-year contract with the club.

In the 19th century, historians began to identify a group of individuals who were instrumental in the country's founding and the development of its government and institutions.\n\n**Origin of Phrase**\n\nThe term \"Founding Fathers\" was first used by the American historian and politician George Bancroft in his 1834-74 multi-volume history of the United States. Bancroft used the term to describe the individuals who played a key role in the American Revolution and the drafting of the United States Constitution. Over time, the term has come to be used more broadly to describe the individuals who played a leading role in the country's founding and the development of its government and institutions.\n\n**List of Founding Fathers**\n\nThe list of Founding Fathers includes a diverse group of individuals who played a leading role in the country's fight for independence and the drafting of the United States Constitution.

The Association is responsible for promoting and developing the sport within its jurisdiction, organizing competitions, and providing resources for players, coaches, and officials.\n\n**#History**\n\nThe Faithful & District Football Association was established in 1895, making it one of the oldest regional football associations in Australia. The Association was formed through the merger of several smaller clubs and leagues in the region, with the goal of creating a unified governing body for the sport.\n\nIn the early years, the F&DFA faced significant challenges in developing the sport in the region. The Association had to contend with limited resources, lack of infrastructure, and competition from other sports such as cricket and rugby. However, the F&DFA persevered and implemented a range of initiatives to promote and develop the sport, including the establishment of competitions, training programs, and coaching clinics.\n\nOver the years, the F&DFA has undergone several changes and restructurings, including the introduction of new competitions, rules, and regulations. In 1975, the Association introduced the first women's competition, which has since become a major drawcard for the region. The F&DFA has also introduced a range of programs to promote and develop the sport, including junior development programs, coaching clinics, and umpiring courses.\n\n**#Football Clubs**\n\nThe F&DFA is comprised of a number of member clubs, each with its own unique history, culture, and tradition. Some of the most notable clubs in the Association include:\n\n* **Faithful Magpies**: One of the oldest and most successful clubs in the region, the Magpies have a long and proud history of competing at the highest level.\n* **District Blues**: The Blues have a strong tradition of producing talented players and have won numerous premierships over the years.\n* **Faithful Tigers**: The Tigers have a reputation for being one of the most fighting and resilient clubs in the Association.\n* **Newtown Hawks**: The Hawks have a strong following in the local community and have been a major force in the Association for many years.\n\nEach club has its own unique identity and culture, and they work together with the F&DFA to promote and develop the sport in the region.\n\n**#Football Grand Finals**\n\nThe F&DFA hosts an annual grand final, which is one of the most highly anticipated events in the region's sporting calendar. The grand final is played between the winners of the Association's premier competition, and it is often a closely contested and thrilling match.\n\nThe grand final is typically played at the Faithful Oval, which is one of the premier sporting facilities in the region. The Oval has a seating capacity of over 10,000, and it is equipped with state-of-the-art facilities and amenities.\n\nThe grand final is a major event for the region, and it attracts a large and enthusiastic crowd. The event is also broadcast live on local radio and television, and it is streamed online for fans who are unable to attend in person.\n\n**#O'Loan Cup**\n\nThe O'Loan Cup is a prestigious competition that is held annually by the F&DFA. The Cup is named in honor of a former President of the Association, who was a passionate advocate for the sport.\n\nThe O'Loan Cup is a knockout competition that is open to all clubs in the Association. The competition is played on a round-robin basis, with the winner of each match progressing to the next round.\n\nThe O'Loan Cup is highly regarded in the region, and it is a major source of pride for the clubs that compete in it. The competition is seen as a way to promote and develop the sport, and to recognize the achievements of the clubs and players.\n\n**#Officer Bearers**\n\nThe F&DFA is governed by a group of officer bearers, who are responsible for making key decisions and driving the sport forward in the region. The officer bearers include:\n\n* **President**: The President is the highest-ranking officer in the Association and is responsible for setting the overall direction and strategy for the sport.\n* **Vice-President**: The Vice-President supports the President and assumes their duties in their absence.\n* **Secretary**: The Secretary is responsible for the day-to-day administration of the Association and ensures that all correspondence and paperwork is completed in a timely and efficient manner.\n* **Treasurer**: The Treasurer is responsible for managing the Association's finances and ensuring that all financial transactions are accurate and compliant with relevant laws and regulations.\n\nThe officer bearers work together to promote and develop the sport, and to ensure that the Association is run in a fair, transparent, and accountable manner.\n\n**#References**\n\nThis article is a comprehensive guide to the Faithful & District Football Association.

These films have been recognized and celebrated for their contributions to the fight for LGBT rights and their portrayal of LGBT individuals in a positive and authentic light. This article provides an overview of various lists of feature films that feature LGBT characters, including those from different genres, decades, and regions.\n\n**Early Years of LGBT Representation in Film**\n\n## 1920s-1950s: Silent Era and Early Sound Films\n\nThe early years of cinema saw a limited number of films that featured LGBT characters, often in subtle or coded ways. The silent era, in particular, offered a platform for filmmakers to explore themes and emotions through pantomime and visual storytelling. One notable example from this period is the 1922 film \"The Wind\" directed by Victor Sjöström, which features a lesbian theme.\n\n## 1950s-1960s: Hollywood Censorship and the Rise of Exploitation Films\n\nThe 1950s and 1960s saw the rise of Hollywood's Hays Code, which imposed strict censorship on films, including the prohibition of explicit LGBT content. However, the code was not always enforced, and some films managed to slip through the cracks. The 1952 film \"The Traitor's Gate\" is an example of a film that featured a gay character, albeit in a negative light.\n\n## 1970s-1980s: Gay Cinema and the Emergence of Queer Art House\n\nThe 1970s and 1980s saw the emergence of gay cinema, with films that explored LGBT themes and storylines in a more explicit and unapologetic manner.

This increase in visibility was partly due to changes in marketing strategies, with studios recognizing the potential of LGBT-themed films to attract a wider audience. Notable films from this period include \"Philadelphia\" (1993), \"Boys Don't Cry\" (1999), and \"Milk\" (2008).\n\n## 2010s: Blockbuster LGBT Films and the Rise of Queer Cinema\n\nThe 2010s saw a surge in blockbuster LGBT films, with films like \"Brokeback Mountain\" (2005), \"The Kids Are All Right\" (2010), and \"Moonlight\" (2016) receiving widespread critical acclaim and commercial success. This period also saw the rise of queer cinema, with films that explored LGBT themes and storylines in a more nuanced and complex manner. Notable films from this period include \"The Danish Girl\" (2015), \"Carol\" (2015), and \"Call Me By Your Name\" (2017).\n\n**Regional LGBT Cinema**\n\n## Asian LGBT Cinema\n\nAsian LGBT cinema has a rich and diverse history, with films that explore LGBT themes and storylines in a unique and culturally specific manner. Notable films from this region include \"A City of Sadness\" (1989), \"Scent of Green Papaya\" (1993), and \"Departures\" (2008).\n\n## Latin American LGBT Cinema\n\nLatin American LGBT cinema has a growing presence, with films that explore LGBT themes and storylines in a vibrant and dynamic manner. Notable films from this region include \"The Night of the Hunter\" (1962), \"The House of Marley\" (1973), and \"The Headless Woman\" (2008).\n\n## African LGBT Cinema\n\nAfrican LGBT cinema is a relatively new and emerging field, with films that explore LGBT themes and storylines in a unique and culturally specific manner. Notable films from this region include \"Fools in Love\" (1997), \"Desert Rose\" (2005), and \"Timbuktu\" (2014).\n\n**Lists of LGBT Films by Genre**\n\n## LGBT Drama Films\n\nThis list includes films that explore LGBT themes and storylines in a dramatic and nuanced manner. Notable films include \"The Remains of the Day\" (1993), \"The Hours\" (2002), and \"The Normal Heart\" (2014).\n\n## LGBT Comedy Films\n\nThis list includes films that use humor to explore LGBT themes and storylines. Notable films include \"The Birdcage\" (1996), \"My Beautiful Laundrette\" (1985), and \"Bridegroom\" (2013).\n\n## LGBT Horror Films\n\nThis list includes films that use horror to explore LGBT themes and storylines. Notable films include \"The Witch\" (2015), \"American Mary\" (2012), and \"A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night\" (2014).\n\n## LGBT Science Fiction Films\n\nThis list includes films that use science fiction to explore LGBT themes and storylines.

The film stars Austin Butler as Elvis Presley and Tom Hanks as Colonel Tom Parker, Presley's manager. The movie explores Presley's life, from his early days as a young musician to his rise to fame and his struggles with the pressures of fame.\n\nPlot\n--------\n\nThe film begins with Elvis Presley (Austin Butler) as a young musician performing on stage with his band, Scotty and Bill. Elvis's unique blend of rockabilly and gospel music captures the attention of Colonel Tom Parker (Tom Hanks), a shrewd music promoter who sees an opportunity to make a fortune with the young singer. Parker becomes Presley's manager, and together they begin to build Presley's career, with Parker taking a significant share of the profits.\n\nAs Elvis's fame grows, so does his dependence on Parker, who becomes increasingly controlling and manipulative. Elvis begins to feel trapped by his manager's demands, and his relationship with his family, including his parents Gladys (Selina Glyph) and Vernon (Luke Grimes), begins to suffer. Elvis also falls in love with Priscilla Presley (Olivia DeJonge), whom he meets while serving in the military, and the two eventually get married.\n\nDespite his success, Elvis struggles with the pressures of fame, including the constant scrutiny of the media and the expectations of his fans. He also grapples with the changing music scene, as rock and roll becomes increasingly popular and he is seen as a relic of the past. In a bid to stay relevant, Elvis turns to more commercial and pop-oriented music, which alienates some of his fans and critics.\n\nCast\n-----\n\n* Austin Butler as Elvis Presley\n* Tom Hanks as Colonel Tom Parker\n* Olivia DeJonge as Priscilla Presley\n* Luke Grimes as Vernon Presley\n* Selina Glyph as Gladys Presley\n* David Wenham as Vernon's brother\n* Helen Thomson as Dixie Locke\n* Josh McConville as Jerry Schilling\n* Kelvin Harrison Jr. as Bobby Moore\n* Xavier Samuel as Ed Parker\n\nProduction\n-----------\n\n### Development and casting\n\nThe film was in development for several years, with Baz Luhrmann attached to direct and produce.

The election was marked by a high voter turnout and a significant shift in the country's political landscape.\n\n**Background**\n\nEstonia has a mixed electoral system, with 60 seats allocated using proportional representation and 41 seats allocated using a majoritarian system. The proportional representation seats are allocated using a closed-list system, where voters vote for a party list rather than individual candidates. The majoritarian seats are allocated using a single-member constituency system, where voters vote for a single candidate in their constituency.\n\nEstonia has a history of proportional representation in its electoral system, which has led to a relatively stable coalition government since the country's independence in 1991. However, the country has seen a significant shift in public opinion in recent years, with a growing concern about the influence of foreign powers, particularly Russia, on Estonian politics.\n\n**Electoral system**\n\n### Seats by electoral district\n\nThe 41 majoritarian seats are allocated using a single-member constituency system, where voters vote for a single candidate in their constituency. The constituencies are based on the country's 15 counties, with each county electing at least one member to the Riigikogu. The remaining seats are allocated using a compensatory system to ensure that the total number of seats allocated to each party reflects the party's national vote share.\n\nThe 60 proportional representation seats are allocated using a closed-list system, where voters vote for a party list rather than individual candidates. The party lists are ranked in order of the party's national vote share, with the party winning the most votes winning the most seats.\n\n### Pre-election composition\n\nThe pre-election composition of the Riigikogu was as follows:\n\n* **Isamaa**: 12 seats\n* **Eesti 200**: 9 seats\n* **SDE**: 8 seats\n* **Eesti Konservatiivne Rahvaerakond (EKR)**: 7 seats\n* **EKRE**: 7 seats\n* **Eesti Reformierakond (RE)**: 7 seats\n* **Eesti Vabaerakond (EVA)**: 1 seat\n\n**Contesting parties**\n\nThe following parties contested the election:\n\n* **Isamaa (I)**: A centre-right party that formed in 2012 through the merger of the Pro Patria and Res Publica Union and the Estonian People's Union.\n* **Eesti 200 (E200)**: A centre-left party that formed in 2018 through the merger of the Estonian Centre Party and the Social Democratic Party.\n* **Sotsiaaldemokraatlik Erakond (SDE)**: A social democratic party that formed in 1990.\n* **Eesti Konservatiivne Rahvaerakond (EKR)**: A conservative party that formed in 2012.\n* **Eesti Vabaerakond (EVA)**: A liberal party that formed in 2012.\n* **Eesti Reformierakond (RE)**: A liberal party that formed in 1994.\n* **Eesti Keskerakond (KE)**: A centre party that formed in 1991.\n\n### Party manifestos and slogans\n\nThe main parties released their party manifestos and slogans ahead of the election, which included the following key promises:\n\n* **Isamaa (I)**: \"Strengthening Estonia's independence and sovereignty\"\n* **Eesti 200 (E200)**: \"Building a stronger and more equal Estonia\"\n* **SDE (SDE)**: \"Creating a more just and equal society\"\n* **Eesti Konservatiivne Rahvaerakond (EKR)**: \"Protecting Estonian culture and traditions\"\n* **EKRE (EKRE)**: \"Defending Estonian values and way of life\"\n* **Eesti Reformierakond (RE)**: \"Pursuing a more open and liberal society\"\n* **Eesti Vabaerakond (EVA)**: \"Promoting individual freedom and responsibility\"\n\n**Campaign**\n\nThe election campaign began on 21 February 2023 and lasted for 14 days. The parties held various campaign events and rallies across the country, with a focus on social media and online advertising.\n\n### Issues\n\nThe main issues discussed during the campaign included:\n\n* **Immigration**: The parties debated the issue of immigration, with some parties advocating for stricter immigration policies and others advocating for a more liberal approach.\n* **Economy**: The parties discussed the state of the economy, with some parties advocating for more government intervention and others advocating for a more free-market approach.\n* **Foreign policy**: The parties debated the issue of foreign policy, with some parties advocating for a more internationalist approach and others advocating for a more nationalist approach.\n\n### Debates\n\nThe parties held several debates during the campaign, which were broadcast on television and online. The debates were marked by a focus on domestic policy issues, including the economy and immigration.\n\n**Opinion polls**\n\nThe opinion polls ahead of the election suggested a close contest between the main parties, with **Isamaa (I)** and **Eesti 200 (E200)** leading the polls. However, the polls also suggested a high level of uncertainty and unpredictability, with many voters undecided or planning to vote for smaller parties.\n\n**Results**\n\nThe election results were as follows:\n\n* **Isamaa (I)**: 29 seats (28.8% of the vote)\n* **Eesti 200 (E200)**: 25 seats (25.4% of the vote)\n* **SDE (SDE)**: 14 seats (14.2% of the vote)\n* **Eesti Konservatiivne Rahvaerakond (EKR)**: 12 seats (12.3% of the vote)\n* **EKRE (EKRE)**: 7 seats (7.3% of the vote)\n* **Eesti Reformierakond (RE)**: 6 seats (6.2% of the vote)\n* **Eesti Vabaerakond (EVA)**: 1 seat (1.1% of the vote)\n\n**Results by constituency**\n\nThe election results by constituency were as follows:\n\n* **Tallinn**: **Isamaa (I)** 10 seats, **Eesti 200 (E200)** 8 seats\n* **Harju County**: **Isamaa (I)** 5 seats, **Eesti 200 (E200)** 4 seats\n* **Lääne-Viru County**: **Isamaa (I)** 2 seats, **Eesti 200 (E200)** 1 seat\n* **Ida-Viru County**: **Isamaa (I)** 1 seat, **Eesti 200 (E200)** 1 seat\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe election results marked a significant shift in the country's political landscape, with **Isamaa (I)** and **Eesti 200 (E200)** emerging as the two main parties. The election also saw a significant increase in support for the **SDE (SDE)**, which won 14 seats.\n\nThe election results also raised questions about the future of the **EKRE (EKRE)**, which lost 7 seats and failed to meet its expectations. The party's leader, **Marti Helme**, announced his resignation as leader of the party.\n\n**Government formation**\n\nThe election results led to a protracted period of government formation, with **Isamaa (I)** and **Eesti 200 (E200)** initially forming a coalition government. However, the coalition eventually collapsed, leading to a snap election in 2024.\n\n**See also**\n\n* **Politics of Estonia**\n* **Estonian parliamentary elections**\n\n**Notes**\n\nThis article is based on the information available at the time of the election and may not reflect any subsequent developments or changes.\n\n**References**\n\nThis article does not contain any references.\n\n**External links**\n\n* **Estonian Election Commission**: Official website of the Estonian Election Commission, which provides information on the election and its results.\n* **Estonian Government**: Official website of the Estonian Government, which provides information on the country's politics and government.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_Estonian_parliamentary_election\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Electoral system\n##Seats by electoral district\n##Pre-election composition\n#Contesting parties\n##Party manifestos and slogans\n#Campaign\n##Issues\n##Debates\n#Opinion polls\n#Results\n##Results by constituency\n#Aftermath\n##Government formation\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

In South Africa, the law governing testate succession is governed by the Wills Act 7 of 1953, which sets out the rules and procedures for verifying the validity of a will, executing it, and distributing the estate according to the testator's wishes.\n\n**Freedom of Testation**\n\nThe freedom to make a will, also known as the right to disinherit, is an essential aspect of testate succession in South Africa. However, this freedom is not absolute and is subject to certain limitations.\n\n### Limitations\n\n#### Illegal Dispositions and Those Against Public Policy\n\nA will that contains illegal dispositions or those that are against public policy will be invalid.

(formerly Facebook, Inc.). The app was announced in 2023 and launched in July of the same year. Threads allows users to share text posts with their friends, as well as join and participate in public discussions.\n\n**History**\n\n### Predecessor\n\nThreads is not the first social media platform developed by Meta. The company has a history of creating and acquiring various social media platforms, including Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook. However, Threads is seen as a response to the growing popularity of other social media platforms, such as Twitter and Mastodon.\n\n### Development and announcement\n\nDevelopment of Threads began in 2022, with a team of engineers and designers working on the project. The app was initially codenamed \"P92\" and was announced in a press release on February 22, 2023. The announcement stated that Threads would be a new way for users to share text posts with their friends and join public discussions.\n\n### Launch\n\nThreads was launched on July 5, 2023, for both iOS and Android devices. The app was initially available in 100 countries, with plans to expand to more countries in the future. At launch, Threads allowed users to share posts with their friends, as well as join public discussions and follow hashtags.\n\n**Appearance and features**\n\n### Possibility of open interoperability\n\nOne of the key features of Threads is its potential for open interoperability. This means that users may be able to share their content across different social media platforms, without having to create separate accounts or duplicate their content. However, the extent to which this feature will be implemented is still unclear.\n\n### Account integration with Instagram\n\nThreads allows users to integrate their Instagram account, which means that they can share their Instagram posts and stories on Threads as well. This feature is seen as a way to increase user engagement and make it easier for users to share their content across different platforms.\n\n### Device compatibility\n\nThreads is available on both iOS and Android devices, as well as on the web. This means that users can access Threads from their smartphone, tablet, or computer.\n\n### Censorship attempts\n\nIn the months following its launch, Threads faced several attempts at censorship. In some countries, the app was blocked or restricted, citing concerns over content moderation and user safety. However, these attempts were ultimately unsuccessful, and Threads remains available in most countries.\n\n### Advertising\n\nThreads does not currently display ads on its platform. However, it is likely that the app will introduce advertising in the future, as a way to generate revenue and fund its development.\n\n**Userbase**\n\n### Decline in the months after launch\n\nIn the months following its launch, Threads experienced a decline in user engagement. According to reports, the app's user base decreased by 20% in the first six months after launch. However, this decline is not unique to Threads, and many social media platforms experience a similar decline in user engagement over time.\n\n### Popularity in Taiwan\n\nDespite the decline in user engagement, Threads remains popular in Taiwan. According to reports, the app has a strong user base in Taiwan, and is seen as a popular alternative to other social media platforms.\n\n**Responses**\n\n### Intellectual property dispute\n\nIn 2023, Threads faced an intellectual property dispute with a third-party developer. The dispute centered around the use of a similar logo and branding to another social media platform. However, the dispute was ultimately resolved, and the developer agreed to drop their claims.\n\n### Data privacy\n\nThreads has faced criticism over its data privacy policies. Some users have expressed concerns over the app's collection and use of user data, as well as its lack of transparency in this regard. However, Threads has stated that it takes user data protection seriously, and is committed to transparency and accountability.\n\n### State media\n\nIn some countries, Threads has been criticized for its perceived bias towards state media. Some users have expressed concerns over the app's treatment of certain news sources and its failure to provide a balanced view of current events. However, Threads has stated that it is committed to providing a neutral and impartial platform for users.\n\n### Imitating other platforms\n\nSome users have criticized Threads for imitating other social media platforms. According to reports, the app's design and features are seen as too similar to other platforms, such as Twitter and Mastodon. However, Threads has stated that it is committed to innovation and differentiation, and is working to develop a unique and engaging user experience.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Social media\n* Meta Platforms, Inc.\n* Instagram\n* WhatsApp\n* Facebook\n\n**References**\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as the article does not require any citations or references.)\n\n**Further reading**\n\n* \"Threads: A New Social Media Platform from Meta\" (press release)\n* \"The Future of Social Media: A Report on Threads\" (report)\n* \"Threads: A Review of the App's Features and Functionality\" (article)\n\n**External links**\n\n* Threads (official website)\n* Meta Platforms, Inc.

The film is a prequel to the Predator franchise and stars Amber Midthunder, Dakota Beavers, Dane DiLiegro, and Michelle Thrush. It was released on August 5, 2022, by Hulu.\n\n# Plot\n\nThe film takes place in the early 18th century, in the Comanche Nation. The story follows Naru, a young Comanche hunter who is determined to prove herself as a warrior. Naru's tribe is being hunted by a technologically advanced alien species, known as the Yautja, also referred to as the Predator. The Yautja are a species of hunters who have been tracking and killing various species throughout the galaxy. \n\nAs Naru and her tribe are being hunted, she forms an unlikely bond with a wounded Yautja, who is also being tracked by his own kind. The two form an uneasy alliance, with Naru learning about the Yautja's culture and technology, while also trying to protect her tribe from the other Yautja who are intent on killing them.\n\nThroughout the film, Naru faces numerous challenges as she tries to protect her tribe and uncover the secrets of the Yautja. Along the way, she must confront her own prejudices and learn to trust herself and others in order to survive.\n\n# Cast\n\n* Amber Midthunder as Naru, a young Comanche hunter\n* Dakota Beavers as Taabe, Naru's younger brother\n* Dane DiLiegro as the Yautja\n* Michelle Thrush as a Comanche shaman\n* Stormee Kipp as Hikpi, a Comanche warrior\n* Julian Black Antelope as Makwa, a Comanche warrior\n* London Lee as Kyi, a Comanche warrior\n* Lance Reddick as a Comanche leader\n* Colin Woodell as a fur trader\n\n# Production\n\n## Development and casting\n\nThe idea for Prey was first conceived in 2020, when Dan Trachtenberg was approached by 20th Century Studios to develop a new Predator film. Trachtenberg had previously directed the 2015 film 10 Cloverfield Lane, and was drawn to the Predator franchise because of its unique blend of sci-fi and horror elements. \n\nTrachtenberg worked closely with writer Patrick Aison to develop the script, which would eventually become the film we know today. Aison's script drew heavily from the Predator franchise, while also incorporating elements of Native American culture and mythology.\n\n## Filming\n\nFilming for Prey took place in Alberta, Canada, over a period of several months. The film's cast and crew faced numerous challenges during production, including extreme weather conditions and limited access to certain locations.\n\nDespite these challenges, the cast and crew managed to create a visually stunning film that would eventually become one of the most critically acclaimed films of 2022. Amber Midthunder, in particular, received widespread praise for her performance as Naru, which many critics described as a breakout role.\n\n## Language\n\nThe film is primarily spoken in the Comanche language, with some scenes also featuring English. The Comanche language was used extensively throughout the film, with many cast members speaking the language as their first language.\n\n## Visual effects\n\nThe visual effects in Prey were created by Scanline VFX, a German-based visual effects company that has worked on numerous high-profile films, including the Avengers franchise. The company used a combination of practical and CGI effects to create the film's iconic Predator creature.\n\n# Music\n\nThe score for Prey was composed by Jesse Keeler, a Canadian musician and composer. Keeler's score was heavily influenced by the film's Native American setting, and features a combination of traditional instruments and electronic elements.\n\n# Historical accuracy\n\nPrey was widely praised for its historical accuracy, particularly in its depiction of Native American culture and mythology. The film's writer, Patrick Aison, worked closely with Comanche consultants to ensure that the film's depiction of the Comanche Nation was accurate and respectful.\n\nThe film's use of Comanche language and cultural practices was also widely praised, with many critics noting that it was a rare and refreshing example of Native American representation in mainstream cinema.\n\n# Release\n\nPrey was released on August 5, 2022, on Hulu. The film was initially released in a limited capacity, but quickly gained widespread attention and acclaim.\n\n# Reception\n\n## Audience viewership\n\nPrey was a commercial success, with many viewers praising the film's unique blend of sci-fi and horror elements. The film's audience viewership was particularly strong among Native American communities, who praised the film's accurate and respectful depiction of their culture and experiences.\n\n## Critical response\n\nPrey received widespread critical acclaim, with many critics praising the film's unique blend of sci-fi and horror elements, as well as its accurate and respectful depiction of Native American culture. The film holds a 93% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with many critics noting that it was one of the best films of 2022.\n\n## Accolades\n\nPrey received numerous awards and nominations, including several Critics' Choice Awards and a Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film.\n\n# Sequel\n\nIn January 2023, it was announced that a sequel to Prey was in development, with Dan Trachtenberg set to return as director. The sequel is expected to explore new characters and storylines, while also continuing the adventures of Naru and the Yautja.\n\n# Notes\n\nPrey was a critical and commercial success, and marked a new direction for the Predator franchise. The film's accurate and respectful depiction of Native American culture and mythology was widely praised, and marked a rare example of representation in mainstream cinema.\n\nThe film's success can be attributed to the hard work and dedication of its cast and crew, who managed to create a visually stunning and entertaining film that would eventually become one of the most critically acclaimed films of 2022.\n\n# References\n\nThis article uses only publicly available information and does not include any citations or references.\n\n# External links\n\n* Prey (2022 film) on IMDb\n* Prey (2022 film) on Rotten Tomatoes\n* Prey (2022 film) on Metacritic", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Prey_(2022_film)\" following this outline:\n\n#Plot\n#Cast\n#Production\n##Development and casting\n##Filming\n##Language\n##Visual effects\n#Music\n#Historical accuracy\n#Release\n#Reception\n##Audience viewership\n##Critical response\n##Accolades\n#Sequel\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The effects of climate change are widespread and varied, impacting ecosystems, human settlements, and societies around the world. This article provides an overview of the effects of climate change, exploring the changes in temperature, weather patterns, land use, oceans, ice and snow, wildlife, and human societies.\n\n**Changes in Temperature**\n\nOne of the most notable effects of climate change is the increase in global temperatures. The average global temperature has risen by about 1°C since the late 19th century, and the 20 warmest years on record have all occurred since 1981. This warming trend is expected to continue, with projections suggesting an increase of 2-5°C by the end of the century.\n\n**Weather**\n\nChanges in temperature and weather patterns are closely linked. Rising temperatures lead to more extreme weather events, such as heat waves, heavy rainfall, and severe storms.\n\n### **Heat Waves and Temperature Extremes**\n\nHeat waves are prolonged periods of abnormally hot weather, often accompanied by high humidity. They can have devastating effects on human health, particularly for vulnerable populations such as the elderly, young children, and people with pre-existing medical conditions. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), heat waves are responsible for thousands of deaths worldwide each year.\n\n### **Rain**\n\nHeavy rainfall events are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change. This can lead to flooding, landslides, and soil erosion, causing significant damage to infrastructure and disrupting daily life. The Amazon rainforest, often referred to as the \"lungs of the Earth,\" is particularly vulnerable to changes in rainfall patterns, which can have far-reaching consequences for global climate regulation.\n\n### **Extreme Storms**\n\nSevere storms, including hurricanes, typhoons, and cyclones, are becoming more intense and frequent due to climate change. These storms can cause catastrophic damage to coastal communities, leading to loss of life, displacement, and economic devastation.\n\n**Land**\n\nChanges in temperature and weather patterns also impact land use, leading to a range of effects, including floods, droughts, and wildfires.\n\n### **Floods**\n\nFloods are becoming more frequent and severe due to climate change, particularly in low-lying areas and coastal regions. Rising sea levels and more intense rainfall events are contributing to an increased risk of flooding, which can have devastating effects on communities and infrastructure.\n\n### **Droughts**\n\nDroughts are also becoming more frequent and severe due to climate change. This can have significant impacts on agriculture, water security, and human health, particularly in regions where droughts are already a significant concern.\n\n### **Wildfires**\n\nWildfires are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change, particularly in regions with dry conditions and strong winds. These fires can have devastating effects on wildlife, ecosystems, and human communities, leading to loss of life, property damage, and long-term environmental degradation.\n\n**Oceans**\n\nThe oceans are also experiencing significant impacts from climate change, including sea level rise, ocean acidification, and changes in ocean circulation.\n\n### **Sea Level Rise**\n\nSea levels are rising due to the melting of glaciers and ice sheets, as well as the thermal expansion of seawater as it warms. This can lead to increased flooding, coastal erosion, and saltwater intrusion into freshwater sources, with significant impacts on human settlements, agriculture, and ecosystems.\n\n**Ice and Snow**\n\nChanges in temperature and weather patterns are also impacting ice and snow, leading to a decline in glacier and ice sheet mass, as well as changes in sea ice coverage.\n\n### **Glaciers Decline**\n\nGlaciers are melting at an unprecedented rate due to climate change, with significant impacts on sea level rise, water security, and ecosystems. The loss of glaciers can also have cultural and spiritual impacts on indigenous communities that rely on them for their way of life.\n\n### **Ice Sheets Decline**\n\nIce sheets, including the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets, are also experiencing significant decline due to climate change. This can have far-reaching consequences for sea level rise, ocean circulation, and global climate regulation.\n\n### **Sea Ice Decline**\n\nSea ice decline is also becoming more pronounced due to climate change, with significant impacts on polar ecosystems, ocean circulation, and global climate regulation.\n\n### **Permafrost Thawing**\n\nPermafrost, a layer of soil and rock that remains frozen for two or more consecutive years, is thawing at an unprecedented rate due to climate change. This can have significant impacts on ecosystems, water security, and human health, particularly in Arctic regions.\n\n**Wildlife and Nature**\n\nChanges in temperature and weather patterns are also impacting wildlife and ecosystems, leading to a range of effects, including changes in species distribution, behavior, and extinction risk.\n\n### **Ecosystems on Land**\n\nEcosystems on land are experiencing significant impacts from climate change, including changes in species distribution, behavior, and extinction risk. This can have far-reaching consequences for human health, agriculture, and ecosystem services.\n\n### **Marine Ecosystems**\n\nMarine ecosystems are also experiencing significant impacts from climate change, including changes in species distribution, behavior, and extinction risk. This can have far-reaching consequences for human health, food security, and ecosystem services.\n\n**Tipping Points and Irreversible Impacts**\n\nClimate change can lead to tipping points, where small changes in temperature or weather patterns can trigger large and irreversible impacts on ecosystems, human health, and the economy.\n\n**Health, Food Security, and Water Security**\n\nClimate change can have significant impacts on human health, food security, and water security, particularly in vulnerable populations.\n\n### **Health**\n\nClimate change can lead to increased mortality and morbidity, particularly in vulnerable populations such as the elderly, young children, and people with pre-existing medical conditions. This can be due to heat stress, vector-borne diseases, and other climate-related health impacts.\n\n### **Food Security**\n\nClimate change can lead to changes in agricultural productivity, crop yields, and food availability, particularly in vulnerable regions. This can have significant impacts on food security, particularly in urban areas where food is a critical resource.\n\n### **Water Security**\n\nClimate change can lead to changes in water availability, quality, and distribution, particularly in vulnerable regions. This can have significant impacts on human health, agriculture, and ecosystems, particularly in regions where water is already a scarce resource.\n\n**Human Settlements**\n\nClimate change can have significant impacts on human settlements, including displacement, migration, and conflict.\n\n### **Impacts from Heat**\n\nClimate change can lead to increased mortality and morbidity due to heat stress, particularly in vulnerable populations such as the elderly, young children, and people with pre-existing medical conditions.\n\n### **Low-Lying Coastal Regions**\n\nClimate change can lead to increased flooding, coastal erosion, and saltwater intrusion into freshwater sources, particularly in low-lying coastal regions. This can have significant impacts on human health, agriculture, and ecosystems.\n\n**Impacts on Societies**\n\nClimate change can have significant impacts on societies, including displacement, migration, conflict, and social impacts on vulnerable groups.\n\n### **Displacement and Migration**\n\nClimate change can lead to increased displacement and migration, particularly in vulnerable regions. This can have significant impacts on human health, social cohesion, and economic stability.\n\n### **Conflict**\n\nClimate change can lead to increased conflict, particularly in vulnerable regions. This can be due to competition for resources, land, and water, as well as changes in migration patterns and population dynamics.\n\n### **Social Impacts on Vulnerable Groups**\n\nClimate change can have significant social impacts on vulnerable groups, including women, children, and indigenous communities. This can include increased mortality and morbidity, displacement, and social isolation.\n\n### **Possibility of Societal Collapse**\n\nClimate change can lead to the possibility of societal collapse, particularly in vulnerable regions. This can be due to a range of factors, including displacement, migration, conflict, and economic instability.\n\n**Economic Impacts**\n\nClimate change can have significant economic impacts, including changes in agricultural productivity, crop yields, and food availability, as well as impacts on human health, infrastructure, and ecosystems.\n\n### **Economic Inequality**\n\nClimate change can exacerbate economic inequality, particularly in vulnerable regions. This can be due to a range of factors, including changes in agricultural productivity, crop yields, and food availability, as well as impacts on human health and infrastructure.\n\n### **Highly Affected Sectors**\n\nClimate change can have significant impacts on highly affected sectors, including agriculture, forestry, fisheries, and tourism. This can include changes in productivity, crop yields, and food availability, as well as impacts on human health and infrastructure.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Climate Change\n* Global Warming\n* Sea Level Rise\n* Ocean Acidification\n* Glaciers\n* Ice Sheets\n* Sea Ice\n* Permafrost\n* Ecosystems\n* Biodiversity\n* Human Health\n* Food Security\n* Water Security\n* Displacement\n* Migration\n* Conflict\n* Social Impacts\n* Economic Impacts\n\n**References**\n\n* Sources:\n\t+ IPCC (2020) Climate Change 2020: Mitigation.
