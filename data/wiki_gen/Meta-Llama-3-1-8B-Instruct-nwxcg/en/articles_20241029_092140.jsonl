{"title": "Indeterminacy_debate_in_legal_theory", "content": "#See also\n#Bibliography\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Indeterminacy Debate in Legal Theory\n\nThe indeterminacy debate in legal theory is a crucial discussion in the field of jurisprudence, focusing on the extent to which the law can be understood as a coherent and determinate system. The debate revolves around the idea that the meaning of laws and legal concepts is not fixed or determinate, but rather depends on various factors such as context, interpretation, and social norms.\n\n## History of the Debate\n\nThe indeterminacy debate in legal theory has its roots in the late 19th century, when philosophers such as Friedrich Nietzsche and Henri Bergson challenged traditional notions of determinism and objectivity. In the early 20th century, philosophers like Martin Heidegger and Ludwig Wittgenstein further developed these ideas, emphasizing the importance of context and interpretation in understanding human experience.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, legal scholars such as Ronald Dworkin and H.L.A. Hart began to apply these philosophical ideas to the study of law. Dworkin argued that the law is inherently indeterminate, and that judges must use their discretion to interpret and apply the law in a way that is fair and just. Hart, on the other hand, argued that the law is determinate, but that its determinacy is not necessarily a guarantee of justice.\n\n## Key Concepts\n\n### Indeterminacy\n\nIndeterminacy, in the context of legal theory, refers to the idea that the meaning of laws and legal concepts is not fixed or determinate, but rather depends on various factors such as context, interpretation, and social norms. This means that the same law or legal concept can have different meanings in different contexts, and that the application of the law can be influenced by various social and cultural factors.\n\n### Determinacy\n\nDeterminacy, in contrast to indeterminacy, refers to the idea that the meaning of laws and legal concepts is fixed and determinate. This means that the same law or legal concept has a single, clear meaning that can be applied in a predictable and consistent way.\n\n### Interpretation\n\nInterpretation refers to the process of understanding and applying the meaning of laws and legal concepts. Interpretation can be influenced by various factors such as context, social norms, and cultural background.\n\n### Context\n\nContext refers to the social, cultural, and historical background in which the law is applied. Context can influence the interpretation and application of the law, and can affect the outcome of legal decisions.\n\n## Theories of Indeterminacy\n\n### Dworkin's Theory of Law as Integrity\n\nRonald Dworkin's theory of law as integrity argues that the law is inherently indeterminate, and that judges must use their discretion to interpret and apply the law in a way that is fair and just. According to Dworkin, the law is not a set of fixed rules, but rather a complex and nuanced system that requires judges to use their best judgment to interpret and apply.\n\n### Hart's Theory of Law as Union\n\nH.L.A. Hart's theory of law as union argues that the law is determinate, but that its determinacy is not necessarily a guarantee of justice. According to Hart, the law is a set of rules that are applied in a predictable and consistent way, but that the application of the law can still be influenced by various social and cultural factors.\n\n### Critical Legal Studies\n\nCritical legal studies is a movement that argues that the law is inherently indeterminate, and that the notion of a fixed and determinate law is a myth. According to critical legal scholars, the law is a product of power and social relations, and that its application is always influenced by various social and cultural factors.\n\n## Critiques of Indeterminacy\n\n### The Critique of Indeterminacy as Relativism\n\nOne critique of indeterminacy is that it can lead to relativism, which is the idea that there is no objective truth or meaning. According to this critique, if the meaning of laws and legal concepts is not fixed or determinate, then anything can be true, and the law becomes a matter of personal opinion.\n\n### The Critique of Indeterminacy as Subjectivism\n\nAnother critique of indeterminacy is that it can lead to subjectivism, which is the idea that the meaning of laws and legal concepts is solely a matter of personal interpretation. According to this critique, if the meaning of laws and legal concepts is not fixed or determinate, then the law becomes a matter of individual whims and fancies.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe indeterminacy debate in legal theory is a complex and multifaceted discussion that has far-reaching implications for our understanding of the law and its role in society. While some scholars argue that the law is inherently indeterminate, others argue that it is determinate, but that its determinacy is not necessarily a guarantee of justice. Ultimately, the indeterminacy debate highlights the importance of context, interpretation, and social norms in understanding the meaning and application of the law.\n\n## See also\n\n* Legal positivism\n* Natural law\n* Critical legal studies\n* Interpretation (law)\n* Contextuality\n\n## Bibliography\n\n* Dworkin, R.

From its early beginnings in the 19th century to the present day, rock climbing has evolved into a global sport and recreational activity. This article will explore the development of rock climbing, highlighting key milestones, innovations, and trends that have shaped the sport into what it is today.\n\n## Origins\n\nThe earliest recorded evidence of rock climbing dates back to ancient civilizations, where people climbed rocks for various purposes such as spiritual practices, hunting, and exploration. In ancient Egypt, Greece, and China, climbers scaled rocks and mountains for ceremonial and ritual purposes. These early climbers likely used basic techniques, such as hand and footholds, to ascend rock faces.\n\n## 19th century\n\nIn the 19th century, rock climbing began to take on a more recreational and sportive character. In the United Kingdom, the first recorded rock climbing expedition was led by William Parish Robertson in 1786, who climbed the mountain of Ben Nevis in Scotland. This marked the beginning of a growing interest in rock climbing as a recreational activity. During this period, climbers began to develop basic equipment, such as ropes and harnesses, which would later become essential for safety and protection.\n\n## 1900s\n\nThe early 20th century saw a significant increase in rock climbing popularity, particularly in the United States and Europe. In the United States, climbers like John Muir and Clarence King explored the Sierra Nevada mountain range, establishing many of the early climbing routes. In Europe, climbers like Albert Mummery and Georges Willan made groundbreaking ascents in the Alps. During this period, climbers began to develop more advanced techniques, such as belaying and anchor placement, which improved safety and allowed for more ambitious climbs.\n\n## 1910s\n\nThe 1910s saw the establishment of the first climbing clubs, such as the Alpine Club in the United Kingdom and the Sierra Club in the United States. These clubs provided a platform for climbers to share knowledge, equipment, and experiences, which helped to promote the sport and improve safety standards. Climbers like Edward FitzGerald and H. S. A. Herbert made significant contributions to climbing techniques and equipment during this period.\n\n## 1920s\n\nThe 1920s were marked by significant advances in climbing technology, particularly in the development of ropes and harnesses. The introduction of the first nylon ropes and aluminum carabiners improved safety and made climbing more accessible. Climbers like Fritz Wiessner and Robert F. Scott made notable ascents in the Alps and the Andes. This period also saw the rise of climbing competitions, such as the first climbing championships held in 1927.\n\n## 1930s\n\nThe 1930s saw a significant increase in climbing popularity, particularly in the United States. Climbers like Charles Houston and Charles Wilkins made groundbreaking ascents in the Himalayas and the Andes. This period also saw the establishment of the first climbing guides, such as the famous Swiss guide, Fritz Wiessner. The development of new equipment, such as pitons and ice axes, allowed climbers to tackle more challenging routes.\n\n## 1940s\n\nThe 1940s saw a significant shift in climbing trends, with a focus on more technical and sportive climbing. Climbers like Reinhold Messner and Wolfgang Niedlich made notable ascents in the Alps and the Andes. This period also saw the introduction of the first climbing competitions, such as the first World Climbing Championships held in 1947.\n\n## 1950s\n\nThe 1950s saw a significant increase in climbing popularity, particularly in the United States and Europe. Climbers like Yvon Chouinard and Lynn Hill made groundbreaking ascents in the Sierra Nevada and the Alps. This period also saw the development of new equipment, such as crampons and ice axes, which allowed climbers to tackle more challenging routes.\n\n## 1960s\n\nThe 1960s saw a significant shift in climbing trends, with a focus on more radical and adventurous climbing. Climbers like Reinhold Messner and Peter Habeler made notable ascents in the Himalayas. This period also saw the rise of climbing competitions, such as the first Indoor Climbing Championships held in 1969.\n\n## 1970s\n\nThe 1970s saw a significant increase in climbing popularity, particularly in the United States and Europe. Climbers like Lynn Hill and Yvon Chouinard made groundbreaking ascents in the Sierra Nevada and the Alps. This period also saw the development of new equipment, such as helmets and knee pads, which improved safety and made climbing more accessible.\n\n## 1980s\n\nThe 1980s saw a significant shift in climbing trends, with a focus on more extreme and adventurous climbing. Climbers like Reinhold Messner and Peter Habeler made notable ascents in the Himalayas. This period also saw the rise of climbing competitions, such as the first World Cup Climbing Championships held in 1988.\n\n## 1990s\n\nThe 1990s saw a significant increase in climbing popularity, particularly in the United States and Europe.

Climbers like Alex Honnold and Tommy Caldwell made groundbreaking ascents in the Sierra Nevada and the Alps. This period also saw the development of new equipment, such as climbing shoes and chalk bags, which improved performance and made climbing more accessible.\n\n## 2020s\n\nThe 2020s have seen a significant shift in climbing trends, with a focus on more extreme and adventurous climbing. Climbers like Alex Honnold and Tommy Caldwell have continued to push the limits of what is possible, making notable ascents in the Sierra Nevada and the Alps.

It began airing on January 4, 2023, on Global and concluded on April 18, 2023. The season premiered with a live episode, where the first eight houseguests entered the house. The season was hosted by Arisa Cox.\n\n# HouseGuests\n\nThe season featured a diverse group of sixteen houseguests competing for the grand prize of $750,000. The houseguests were:\n\n1. Adam Pike\n2. Amy Gagné\n3. Anthony Douglas\n4. Evan Franko\n5. Georgia Chalkitis\n6. Jessica Niles\n7. José Garza\n8. Kenny Zullo\n9. Liza Huard\n10. Matt Karsey\n11. Melissa D'Costa\n12. Neda Tafazoli\n13. Nicole Nabulsi\n14. Raul Carranza\n15. Sarah Hanlon\n16. Terry Loomis\n\n## Future appearances\n\nSome of the houseguests from Season 11 have gone on to appear in other reality television shows.

Meanwhile, Sarah Hanlon competed in the reality competition series Big Brother Australia in 2022.\n\n# Summary\n\nThe season was filled with drama, romance, and competitions. The first few weeks of the season saw a strong alliance form between Adam, Anthony, and Kenny. However, their bond was eventually broken when Adam turned on them and formed a new alliance with Amy, Melissa, and Nicole. Meanwhile, José and Raul formed a strong bond and became one of the most dominant couples in the house.\n\nAs the season progressed, the houseguests competed in various challenges, including the Head of Household (HOH) competition, the Power of Veto (POV) competition, and the nomination ceremony. The houseguests also participated in several twists, including the Dead Last Nomination, the Belairdirect Eviction Protection Insurance, the Wendy's Rewards Points, the Whodunit Week, and the Fatal Feast.\n\n# Episodes\n\nThe season consisted of 85 episodes, including the premiere episode, the finale episode, and 83 regular episodes. Each episode was approximately 60 minutes long and featured a mix of competitions, nominations, evictions, and twists.\n\n# Twists\n\nThe season featured several twists, including:\n\n## Dead Last Nomination\n\nIn this twist, the houseguest who received the fewest votes in the nomination ceremony was not automatically nominated for eviction. Instead, they were given the opportunity to choose whether or not to be nominated.\n\n## Belairdirect Eviction Protection Insurance\n\nIn this twist, the houseguest who won the POV competition was given the opportunity to save one of their nominated houseguests from eviction. The saved houseguest was then immune from eviction for the week.\n\n## Wendy's Rewards Points\n\nIn this twist, the houseguest who won the HOH competition was given the opportunity to earn rewards points, which could be used to win prizes or advantages in future competitions.\n\n## Whodunit Week\n\nIn this twist, the houseguests were given clues to solve a mystery, and the first houseguest to solve the mystery would win a prize.\n\n## Fatal Feast\n\nIn this twist, the houseguests were given a meal that had been poisoned. The houseguests had to figure out which houseguest had poisoned the meal, and the person who had been poisoned would be evicted from the house.\n\n## Other twists\n\nThe season also featured several other twists, including a surprise visit from a loved one, a secret room, and a hidden compartment.\n\n# Production\n\n## Development\n\nThe season was developed by Insight Productions, the production company behind Big Brother Canada. The show was created by Arisa Cox, who has been hosting the show since its inception.\n\n## Prizes\n\nThe grand prize for the season was $750,000, which was awarded to the last houseguest standing. The runner-up received a prize of $50,000.\n\n## Production design\n\nThe production design for the season was created by a team of designers who worked closely with the producers to create a unique and immersive experience for the houseguests.\n\n## Digital Dailies\n\nThe season featured digital dailies, which were updated daily on the Big Brother Canada website and social media channels.

The process of creating pottery has been practiced for thousands of years, with various cultures and civilizations contributing to its development and evolution.\n\n**Main Types**\n\nPottery can be broadly classified into three main types based on the type of clay used and the firing temperature: earthenware, stoneware, and porcelain.\n\n### **Earthenware**\n\nEarthenware is the most common type of pottery, made from clay that is rich in iron and has a low firing temperature, typically between 1000°C and 1200°C. Earthenware pottery is often used for functional items such as plates, bowls, and cups, and is characterized by its red or brown color. Earthenware is also known for its ability to withstand minor scratches and cracks.\n\n### **Stoneware**\n\nStoneware is a type of pottery made from clay that is fired at a higher temperature than earthenware, typically between 1200°C and 1400°C. Stoneware is denser and more durable than earthenware and is often used for functional items such as cups, bowls, and vases. Stoneware is also known for its smooth, non-porous surface and its ability to withstand heat.\n\n### **Porcelain**\n\nPorcelain is a type of pottery made from a specific type of clay that is fired at an extremely high temperature, typically between 1300°C and 1400°C. Porcelain is known for its whiteness, translucency, and strength, making it ideal for delicate and intricate designs. Porcelain is often used for decorative items such as vases, figurines, and plates.\n\n**Archaeology**\n\nArchaeology plays a significant role in understanding the history and development of pottery. By analyzing the chemical composition and physical properties of pottery, archaeologists can reconstruct the technological and cultural processes involved in its production.\n\n### **Fabric Analysis**\n\nFabric analysis is a technique used to study the physical properties of pottery, such as its texture, porosity, and firing temperature. By analyzing the fabric of a pottery piece, archaeologists can determine its provenance, age, and cultural context.\n\n**Clay Bodies and Raw Materials**\n\nClay bodies are the base materials used to create pottery, and raw materials are the natural substances used to extract and process clay. The most common raw materials used to make pottery are clay, feldspar, and quartz.\n\n**Production**\n\nThe production of pottery involves several stages, including shaping, drying, firing, and decorating.\n\n### **Shaping**\n\nShaping is the process of creating the desired form and shape of the pottery piece. This can be done using a variety of techniques, including hand-building, throwing on a potter's wheel, and slip casting.\n\n### **Drying**\n\nDrying is the process of removing excess moisture from the pottery piece. This can be done using a variety of techniques, including air drying, kiln drying, and spray drying.\n\n### **Firing**\n\nFiring is the process of exposing the pottery piece to high temperatures to achieve the desired hardness and durability. The firing temperature and atmosphere can affect the final color and texture of the pottery.\n\n### **Temperature**\n\nThe temperature at which the pottery is fired can affect its final color and texture. Earthenware is typically fired at a lower temperature than stoneware and porcelain.\n\n### **Atmosphere**\n\nThe atmosphere in which the pottery is fired can also affect its final color and texture. A reducing atmosphere, for example, can produce a range of colors from red to orange to yellow.\n\n### **Methods**\n\nThere are several methods used to fire pottery, including electric kilns, gas kilns, and raku kilns. Each method has its own unique characteristics and advantages.\n\n### **Stages**\n\nThe firing process typically involves several stages, including bisque firing, glaze firing, and final firing. Each stage can affect the final color and texture of the pottery.\n\n### **Decorating**\n\nDecorating is the process of adding designs and patterns to the pottery piece. This can be done using a variety of techniques, including slip trailing, underglazing, and overglazing.\n\n### **Methods**\n\nThere are several methods used to decorate pottery, including hand-painting, stenciling, and decoupage. Each method has its own unique characteristics and advantages.\n\n**Glazing**\n\nGlazing is the process of applying a layer of glaze to the pottery piece to achieve the desired color and texture. Glazes can be made from a variety of materials, including clay, silicates, and metal oxides.\n\n**Health and Environmental Issues**\n\nThe production of pottery can have health and environmental implications. For example, the use of certain types of clay can release toxic substances into the air, while the firing process can release pollutants into the atmosphere.\n\n**History**\n\nThe history of pottery dates back thousands of years, with various cultures and civilizations contributing to its development and evolution.\n\n### **Early Pottery**\n\nEarly pottery was made from clay and was used for functional items such as cups, bowls, and vases. The earliest pottery was likely made in the Fertile Crescent around 9000 BCE.\n\n### **History by Region**\n\nThe history of pottery can be divided into various regions, each with its own unique characteristics and developments.\n\n### **Beginnings of Pottery**\n\nThe beginnings of pottery are not well documented, but it is believed that early humans discovered that clay could be shaped and fired to create durable objects.\n\n### **East Asia**\n\nEast Asia has a long history of pottery, dating back to the Neolithic period around 5000 BCE. The Han Dynasty (206 BCE - 220 CE) is particularly famous for its pottery production.\n\n### **South Asia**\n\nSouth Asia has a rich history of pottery, dating back to the Indus Valley Civilization around 3300 BCE. The Gupta Period (320 - 550 CE) is particularly famous for its pottery production.\n\n### **Southeast Asia**\n\nSoutheast Asia has a long history of pottery, dating back to the Neolithic period around 3500 BCE. The Srivijaya Empire (650 - 1377 CE) is particularly famous for its pottery production.\n\n### **West Asia**\n\nWest Asia has a rich history of pottery, dating back to the Neolithic period around 7000 BCE. The Mesopotamian civilization (3500 - 539 BCE) is particularly famous for its pottery production.\n\n### **Europe**\n\nEurope has a long history of pottery, dating back to the Neolithic period around 6000 BCE. The ancient Greeks (8th - 1st century BCE) are particularly famous for their pottery production.\n\n### **United Kingdom**\n\nThe United Kingdom has a rich history of pottery, dating back to the Neolithic period around 4000 BCE. The Roman occupation of Britain (43 - 410 CE) had a significant impact on the development of pottery in the region.\n\n### **Arabic Pottery**\n\nArabic pottery has a rich history, dating back to the 7th century CE.

The exodus was sparked by rising communal tensions and violence against Kashmiri Hindus, who were perceived as being loyal to India, in the wake of the Kashmir insurgency.\n\n**Background**\n\nKashmir has a long history of Hindu and Buddhist presence, dating back to the ancient times. The Kashmiri Pandits, a community of Kashmiri Hindus, have a rich cultural heritage and have played a significant role in the region's history, politics, and economy. However, the region's demographics began to change in the 19th century, when Muslim ruler Sultan Sikander Butshikan introduced the concept of \"Islamization\" of the region, which led to the conversion of many Kashmiri Hindus to Islam. Despite this, many Kashmiri Hindus continued to practice their faith and maintain their cultural identity.\n\nIn the mid-20th century, following India's independence and the subsequent partition of the Indian subcontinent, Kashmir became a disputed territory between India and Pakistan. The region's demographic makeup began to change again, with many Muslim refugees from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (POK) and other parts of Pakistan settling in the Kashmir Valley. This led to a significant increase in the Muslim population, which eventually became the majority.\n\n**Insurgency activity**\n\nThe Kashmir insurgency, which began in the late 1980s, was a separatist movement that sought to establish an independent Kashmir or merge it with Pakistan. The insurgency was led by various militant groups, including the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF), the Hizbul Mujahideen, and the Lashkar-e-Taiba. These groups were supported by Pakistan, which provided them with funding, arms, and training.\n\n**Attack and threats**\n\nIn 1989, the Kashmir insurgency escalated, and the militant groups began to target Kashmiri Hindus. The first major attack on Kashmiri Hindus was carried out by the JKLF on January 19, 1990, when a group of militants entered the village of Wandhama and killed 21 Kashmiri Hindus. This was followed by a wave of attacks on Kashmiri Hindu villages, towns, and cities, with many people being killed, injured, or forced to flee their homes.\n\nThe militants used various tactics to intimidate and terrorize Kashmiri Hindus, including kidnappings, assassinations, and threats to their families. Many Kashmiri Hindus were forced to leave their homes and flee to other parts of the country, often with little or no belongings. The situation became so dire that the Indian government was forced to declare the Kashmir Valley a \"disturbed area\" and deploy the army to maintain law and order.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe exodus of Kashmiri Hindus had a profound impact on the community. Many families were forced to leave behind their ancestral homes, businesses, and properties, which were often looted or destroyed by the militants. The community's cultural and social fabric was severely damaged, and many Kashmiri Hindus felt a deep sense of loss and trauma.\n\nThe Indian government responded to the exodus by setting up relief camps for the fleeing Kashmiri Hindus. However, the camps were often inadequate, and many people were forced to live in poverty and squalor. The government also launched a rehabilitation program for the Kashmiri Hindus, which included providing them with financial assistance, education, and employment opportunities.\n\n**Rehabilitation**\n\nThe rehabilitation program for Kashmiri Hindus was launched in 1991 and continued for several years. The program aimed to provide financial assistance, education, and employment opportunities to the displaced Kashmiri Hindus. The government provided them with cash assistance, housing, and education scholarships. Many Kashmiri Hindus were also provided with employment opportunities in government and private sectors.\n\nHowever, the rehabilitation program was not without its challenges. Many Kashmiri Hindus felt that the program was inadequate and did not provide them with the support they needed to rebuild their lives. Others felt that the program was biased towards those who had been forced to flee their homes, while those who had remained in the Kashmir Valley were not given sufficient support.\n\n**In popular culture**\n\nThe exodus of Kashmiri Hindus has been depicted in various books and movies. Some notable examples include:\n\n* **Books:**\n\t+ \"The Kashmir Files\" by Siddharth Gigoo, which is a novel that tells the story of a Kashmiri Hindu family's struggle to survive during the exodus.\n\t+ \"The Exile of Kashmiri Pandits\" by Madhu Kishwar, which is a non-fiction book that documents the exodus of Kashmiri Hindus and its impact on the community.\n* **Movies:**\n\t+ \"The Kashmir Files\" (2022), a Bollywood film that tells the story of a Kashmiri Hindu family's struggle to survive during the exodus.\n\t+ \"Mujhse Aanchal\" (2019), a Bollywood film that tells the story of a Kashmiri Hindu woman who is forced to flee her home during the exodus.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Kashmir insurgency\n* Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front\n* Hizbul Mujahideen\n* Lashkar-e-Taiba\n* Pakistan-occupied Kashmir\n* Indian government\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The exodus of Kashmiri Hindus was a complex and multifaceted event that involved various factors, including politics, religion, and economics.\n* The Indian government's response to the exodus was criticized for being inadequate and biased towards those who had been forced to flee their homes.\n* The exodus of Kashmiri Hindus has had a profound impact on the community, causing significant loss and trauma.\n\n**References**\n\n* \"The Kashmir Files\" by Siddharth Gigoo\n* \"The Exile of Kashmiri Pandits\" by Madhu Kishwar\n* \"Mujhse Aanchal\" (2019) (film)\n* \"The Kashmir Files\" (2022) (film)\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n* Gigoo, S.

Heard**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nJohnny Depp and Amber Heard's tumultuous relationship made headlines in 2016, culminating in a highly publicized defamation lawsuit. The case, known as Depp v. Heard, was a closely watched trial that drew widespread attention due to its sensational nature and the high-profile status of the parties involved. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the background, civil action, reactions, and media coverage surrounding the case.\n\n**Background**\n\n### **Depp and Heard's relationship**\n\nJohnny Depp and Amber Heard began dating in 2012, eventually getting married in 2015. However, their relationship was marked by allegations of domestic abuse, with Heard accusing Depp of physical and emotional abuse. Depp denied the allegations, and the couple eventually divorced in 2017.\n\n### **Depp v News Group Newspapers Ltd**\n\nIn 2018, Depp sued News Group Newspapers Ltd (NGN), the publisher of The Sun, for defamation over a 2018 article that claimed he was a \"wife beater.\" Depp's lawsuit alleged that the article was false and damaged his reputation. The case was settled out of court, with NGN issuing a statement apologizing for the article.\n\n### **Heard's op-ed in The Washington Post**\n\nIn December 2018, Amber Heard published an op-ed in The Washington Post titled \"I spoke up against sexual violence — and faced our culture's wrath. That has to change.\" In the article, Heard did not directly mention Depp but described herself as a survivor of domestic abuse. The op-ed sparked a wave of public support for Heard and criticism of Depp.\n\n### **Waldman's comments in the Daily Mail**\n\nIn 2020, Heard's lawyers, led by Roberta Kaplan, filed a motion to dismiss a defamation lawsuit filed by Depp's lawyer, Adam Waldman, over a 2020 article in the Daily Mail that criticized Heard's op-ed. Waldman's comments in the article led to a countersuit by Heard, which was eventually settled out of court.\n\n**Civil action**\n\n### **Pre-trial developments**\n\nThe defamation lawsuit filed by Depp against Heard was initially set to go to trial in 2020 but was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The trial was eventually rescheduled for April 2022.\n\n### **Trial**\n\n#### **Opening statements**\n\nThe trial began on April 11, 2022, with opening statements from both sides. Depp's lawyer, Adam Waldman, argued that Heard's op-ed was defamatory and damaged Depp's reputation. Heard's lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, countered that the op-ed was a truthful account of her experiences with domestic abuse.\n\n#### **Testimony**\n\nOver the course of several weeks, both Depp and Heard testified in court, providing graphic details of their tumultuous relationship. Depp denied all allegations of domestic abuse, while Heard described a pattern of controlling and violent behavior by Depp.\n\n#### **Closing arguments**\n\nIn closing arguments, Depp's lawyer argued that Heard had fabricated the allegations of domestic abuse to gain sympathy and attention. Heard's lawyer countered that Depp's behavior was consistent with a pattern of abuse and that Heard had suffered physical and emotional harm as a result.\n\n#### **Verdict**\n\nOn June 1, 2022, the jury delivered a verdict in favor of Johnny Depp, finding that Heard had defamed him in three statements in her op-ed. The jury awarded Depp $10 million in damages, although the judge later reduced the award to $5 million due to a cap on damages in the case.\n\n### **Post-trial motions**\n\nFollowing the verdict, Heard's lawyers filed a motion for a new trial, arguing that the jury's verdict was inconsistent with the evidence presented.

The match between Arema FC and Persebaya Surabaya on October 1, 2022, was a highly anticipated event, with a large crowd expected to attend.\n\nThe match was the first of its kind between the two teams in six years, with a long-standing rivalry between the two clubs. The event was also being broadcast live on television, adding to the excitement and hype surrounding the match. However, the atmosphere in the stadium quickly turned chaotic, leading to the tragic events that unfolded.\n\n# Disaster\n\nThe disaster began when Arema FC fans, who were in the majority in the stadium, clashed with police and security personnel in the stands. The fans, who were frustrated with the referee's decisions during the match, began to throw objects onto the field, including flares and bottles. The security personnel, who were trying to restore order, responded with batons and pepper spray, leading to a stampede in the stands.\n\nAs the situation spiralled out of control, fans began to rush towards the exit gates, leading to a massive crush. The stampede was exacerbated by the narrow exits and the fact that many fans had entered the stadium without tickets, leading to a crowded and chaotic situation. The crush continued for several minutes, with many fans trapped under the weight of those behind them.\n\n# Casualties\n\nThe exact number of casualties is still unclear, but at least 135 people lost their lives in the disaster. Many more were injured, with estimates suggesting that over 300 people were treated for injuries in the aftermath of the disaster.\n\n## Ages and genders\n\nThe victims of the disaster were largely young men and boys, with many in their teenage years. According to reports, at least 75% of the victims were under the age of 20. The majority of the victims were also male, with only a few female victims reported.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe aftermath of the disaster was chaotic, with many fans trapped in the stadium and others fleeing in panic. Emergency services, including police, ambulance, and fire brigade, were quickly deployed to the scene, but the situation was made more difficult by the fact that many fans had entered the stadium without tickets, making it harder to identify and account for everyone.\n\nAs the situation began to calm down, the bodies of the victims were removed from the stadium, and the injured were taken to nearby hospitals for treatment. The authorities also launched an investigation into the causes of the disaster, with many calling for greater accountability and safety measures to be put in place to prevent such an incident from happening again.\n\n# Legal\n\nThe Indonesian government has launched an investigation into the disaster, with several officials, including the police chief and the governor of East Java, facing questions over their handling of the event. The authorities have also arrested several people, including police officers and stadium officials, on charges related to negligence and reckless endangerment.\n\n# Investigation\n\nThe investigation into the disaster has been led by a joint fact-finding team, comprising representatives from the police, the government, and the Indonesian Football Association. The team has been tasked with identifying the causes of the disaster and making recommendations for preventing similar incidents in the future.\n\n## Police\n\nThe police have faced criticism for their handling of the situation, with many accusing them of using excessive force and failing to respond quickly enough to the emergency. The police have also been accused of ignoring warnings from fans and officials about the potential for violence and disorder.\n\n## Joint fact-finding team\n\nThe joint fact-finding team has been conducting a thorough investigation into the disaster, including interviewing witnesses, reviewing security footage, and analyzing evidence. The team has also been consulting with experts and conducting research to identify the causes of the disaster and make recommendations for preventing similar incidents.\n\n## Autopsies\n\nAutopsies have been conducted on the victims of the disaster, with the findings revealing that many of them died from asphyxiation and head injuries. The autopsies have also revealed that many of the victims had pre-existing medical conditions, including heart problems and high blood pressure.\n\n# Trial\n\nThe trial of those charged in connection with the disaster is ongoing, with several officials and police officers facing charges related to negligence and reckless endangerment. The trial has been marked by controversy, with many accusing the authorities of selectively prosecuting certain individuals while ignoring others who were also responsible for the disaster.\n\n## Result\n\nThe trial has resulted in several convictions, including a police officer who was sentenced to several years in prison for his role in the disaster. However, many of those accused have been acquitted, leading to widespread criticism and calls for greater accountability.\n\n# Reactions\n\nThe disaster has sparked widespread outrage and shock, with many calling for greater accountability and safety measures to be put in place to prevent such an incident from happening again. The Indonesian government has also faced criticism for its handling of the disaster, with many accusing it of failing to respond quickly enough to the emergency.\n\n## FIFA\n\nFIFA has condemned the disaster, calling it a \"tragic incident\" and expressing its condolences to the families of the victims. The organization has also pledged to work with the Indonesian Football Association to implement greater safety measures and ensure that such an incident does not happen again.\n\n## International\n\nThe international community has also reacted with shock and outrage, with many governments and organizations condemning the disaster and offering their condolences to the families of the victims. The United Nations has also called for a thorough investigation into the disaster and for greater accountability to be taken.\n\n## Police\n\nThe police have faced criticism for their handling of the situation, with many accusing them of using excessive force and failing to respond quickly enough to the emergency. The police have also been accused of ignoring warnings from fans and officials about the potential for violence and disorder.\n\n## Abandoned leagues\n\nThe disaster has led to the abandonment of several football leagues in Indonesia, with many clubs and players calling for greater safety measures to be put in place before competitions resume. The Indonesian Football Association has also suspended several matches and leagues, citing safety concerns.\n\n## PSSI\n\nThe PSSI, the Indonesian Football Association, has faced criticism for its handling of the disaster, with many accusing it of failing to take sufficient action to prevent the tragedy. The PSSI has also been accused of ignoring warnings from fans and officials about the potential for violence and disorder.\n\n# In popular culture\n\nThe disaster has been the subject of several dramas and documentaries, including a feature film that was released in 2023. The film, which was directed by a well-known Indonesian director, tells the story of the disaster and its aftermath, highlighting the heroism and tragedy of the events.\n\n## Drama\n\nThe disaster has also been the subject of several dramas and stage productions, including a play that was performed in 2023. The play, which was written by a prominent Indonesian playwright, explores the causes and consequences of the disaster, highlighting the human cost of the tragedy.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of football stadiums in Indonesia\n* Football in Indonesia\n* Stadium-related deaths in Indonesia\n\n# Notes\n\n* This article is based on the Wikipedia article \"Kanjuruhan Stadium disaster\" which was accessed on [date].\n* The article has been edited to conform to the Wikipedia style guide.\n\n# References\n\n* This article has no references.\n\n# External links\n\n* Indonesian Football Association website\n* FIFA website\n* PSSI website", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Kanjuruhan_Stadium_disaster\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Disaster\n#Casualties\n##Ages and genders\n#Aftermath\n#Legal\n#Investigation\n##Police\n##Joint fact-finding team\n##Autopsies\n#Trial\n##Result\n#Reactions\n##FIFA\n##International\n##Police\n##Abandoned leagues\n##PSSI\n#In popular culture\n##Drama\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The team was founded in 1966 and has a rich history, with multiple championship titles and European competition appearances.\n\n**History**\n\n### Founding, early years & First Golden Age (1966–1988)\n\nAEL Limassol B.C. was founded in 1966 by a group of passionate basketball enthusiasts. The team's early years were marked by modest success, with the team finishing in mid-table positions in the Cypriot basketball league. However, by the late 1970s, AEL Limassol B.C. began to experience a period of rapid growth and achievement. The team won its first championship title in 1985, and by the end of the decade, AEL Limassol B.C. had established itself as a dominant force in Cypriot basketball.\n\nDuring this period, AEL Limassol B.C. also began to make a name for itself in European competition.

In 2011, the team was dissolved due to financial difficulties, and its assets were sold to a new ownership group.\n\nHowever, in 2017, a new ownership group was formed, and AEL Limassol B.C. was re-established as a professional basketball club.\n\n### Recent history (2018–present)\n\n#### Return to Division A & reaching two Cup finals (2018–2022)\n\nAEL Limassol B.C. returned to Division A in 2018, and the team has since enjoyed a period of gradual improvement.

The rebellion was a culmination of decades of tensions between the British colonial authorities and the growing number of European settlers in the Victorian goldfields.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe gold rush of the 1850s brought a massive influx of people to the Australian colonies, including thousands of prospectors, miners, and entrepreneurs. The discovery of gold in Victoria in 1851 triggered a frenzy of activity, with people flocking to the goldfields in search of riches. However, the gold rush also created social and economic tensions, as the rapidly growing population put pressure on the limited resources and infrastructure of the time.\n\n**Origins in the Victorian gold rush**\n\nThe tensions between the colonial authorities and the goldfields community began to escalate in the early 1850s. The British government had established a system of taxation and regulations to govern the goldfields, but the miners and prospectors felt that these measures were oppressive and unjust.\n\n### Protests on the goldfields: 1851–1854\n\nThe protests on the goldfields began in 1851, when the colonial authorities introduced a monthly mining tax. The miners and prospectors saw this as an unfair burden and began to organize protests and demonstrations. The protests were led by a group of miners who formed the Ballarat Reform League, which was dedicated to improving the living and working conditions of the miners.\n\n### La Trobe introduces monthly mining tax as protests begin\n\nThe monthly mining tax was introduced by the Governor of Victoria, Sir Charles La Trobe, in an attempt to raise revenue and control the growth of the goldfields. However, the miners saw this as an attack on their livelihoods and began to organize protests and demonstrations.\n\n### First gold commissioner arrives in Ballarat\n\nIn 1853, the first gold commissioner, Captain William Wright, arrived in Ballarat to enforce the mining tax and regulations. However, Wright's attempts to collect the tax were met with resistance from the miners, who saw him as a representative of the oppressive colonial authorities.\n\n### Bendigo Petition and the Red Ribbon Movement\n\nIn 1853, a petition was circulated in Bendigo, calling for the abolition of the monthly mining tax and the establishment of a more democratic system of government. The petition was signed by thousands of miners and was presented to the Legislative Council, which agreed to establish a Commission of Inquiry into the grievances of the goldfields community.\n\n### Legislative Council calls for Commission of Inquiry\n\nThe Legislative Council's decision to establish a Commission of Inquiry was a significant concession to the goldfields community, and it was seen as a major victory for the Ballarat Reform League.\n\n### Hotham replaces La Trobe\n\nIn 1854, Sir Charles La Trobe was replaced as Governor of Victoria by Sir Charles Hotham, who was more sympathetic to the miners' grievances. However, Hotham's attempts to resolve the issue through negotiation were ultimately unsuccessful.\n\n**Tensions escalate**\n\nThe failure of the negotiations between the colonial authorities and the goldfields community led to a significant escalation of tensions. The miners and prospectors began to organize a major protest, which would eventually become the Eureka Rebellion.\n\n### Murder of James Scobie and the burning of the Eureka hotel\n\nIn 1854, a group of miners, including James Scobie, were murdered by a gang of thieves. The burning of the Eureka hotel, which was seen as a symbol of the oppressive colonial authorities, was also a significant event in the lead-up to the rebellion.\n\n### Ballarat Reform League meetings\n\nThe Ballarat Reform League continued to meet and organize, calling for the establishment of a more democratic system of government and the abolition of the monthly mining tax.\n\n### Escalating violence as military convoy looted\n\nAs tensions continued to escalate, a military convoy was looted by a group of miners, leading to a significant escalation of violence.\n\n**Open rebellion**\n\nThe Eureka Rebellion began on December 3, 1854, when a group of miners and prospectors, led by Peter Lalor, marched on the Eureka Stockade, a fortified camp on the outskirts of Ballarat. The rebels were determined to establish a more democratic system of government and to resist the oppressive colonial authorities.\n\n### Paramilitary mobilisation and swearing allegiance to the Southern Cross\n\nThe rebels, who were largely made up of miners and prospectors, mobilized a paramilitary force and swore allegiance to the Southern Cross, a symbol of the rebellion.\n\n### Fortification of the Eureka lead\n\nThe rebels fortified the Eureka lead, a narrow ridge of land that overlooked the surrounding countryside. The Eureka Stockade was a heavily fortified camp, with trenches, barricades, and a flagpole flying the Southern Cross.\n\n### Vinegar Hill blunder: Irish dimension factors in dwindling numbers at stockade\n\nThe Vinegar Hill blunder, which saw a group of rebels make a premature attack on the British forces, was a significant setback for the rebellion. The Irish dimension of the rebellion, which saw many Irish miners and prospectors join the fight, also played a significant role in the dwindling numbers at the stockade.\n\n### Departing detachment of Independent Californian Rangers leaves small garrison behind\n\nA departing detachment of Independent Californian Rangers left a small garrison behind, which was unable to withstand the British forces.\n\n**Battle of the Eureka Stockade**\n\nThe Battle of the Eureka Stockade was a brutal and intense conflict that lasted for several hours. The British forces, led by General Sir George Wright, launched a series of attacks on the Eureka Stockade, which was defended by a small group of rebels.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe Battle of the Eureka Stockade was a significant defeat for the rebels, with many killed or wounded. The rebellion was crushed, and the British authorities established a more autocratic system of government.\n\n### Trials for sedition and high treason\n\nThe British authorities held trials for sedition and high treason, which saw many rebels convicted and imprisoned.\n\n### Commission of Inquiry report\n\nThe Commission of Inquiry report was a significant document that outlined the grievances of the goldfields community and recommended significant reforms.\n\n### Peter Lalor enters parliament\n\nPeter Lalor, the leader of the rebellion, entered parliament and became a Member of the Legislative Council. He continued to advocate for the rights of the goldfields community and played a significant role in shaping the course of Australian history.\n\n**Location of Bakery Hill and the Eureka Stockade**\n\nBakery Hill is a small hill in Ballarat, Victoria, where the Eureka Stockade was located. The site is now a museum and a popular tourist destination.\n\n**Political legacy**\n\nThe Eureka Rebellion had a significant impact on Australian politics, leading to the establishment of a more democratic system of government and the abolition of the monthly mining tax.\n\n**Commemoration**\n\nThe Eureka Rebellion has been commemorated in a number of ways, including the establishment of a monument at the site of the Eureka Stockade.\n\n### 19th century\n\nIn the 19th century, the Eureka Rebellion was seen as a symbol of resistance against oppressive authority and a call for democratic reforms.\n\n### 20th century\n\nIn the 20th century, the Eureka Rebellion was commemorated with a number of events and ceremonies, including the establishment of a museum at the site of the Eureka Stockade.\n\n### 21st century\n\nIn the 21st century, the Eureka Rebellion continues to be celebrated as a significant event in Australian history, with a number of events and ceremonies held to commemorate the rebellion.\n\n**Popular culture**\n\nThe Eureka Rebellion has been depicted in a number of works of popular culture, including films, books, and songs.\n\n### See also\n\n* Australian history\n* Gold rush\n* Democracy\n* Autocracy\n* Rebellion\n* Eureka Stockade\n\n### Notes\n\n* The Eureka Rebellion was a significant event in Australian history, marking a turning point in the country's struggle for democracy and self-governance.\n* The rebellion was a culmination of decades of tensions between the British colonial authorities and the growing number of European settlers in the Victorian goldfields.\n* The Eureka Rebellion was a brutal and intense conflict that lasted for several hours, resulting in the deaths of many rebels and the crushing of the rebellion.\n* The rebellion had a significant impact on Australian politics, leading to the establishment of a more democratic system of government and the abolition of the monthly mining tax.\n* The Eureka Rebellion continues to be commemorated in a number of ways, including the establishment of a monument at the site of the Eureka Stockade.\n\n### References\n\n* None\n\n### Bibliography\n\n* None\n\n### Further reading\n\n* None\n\n### External links\n\n* None", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Eureka_Rebellion\" following this outline:\n\n#Origins in the Victorian gold rush\n##Protests on the goldfields: 1851–1854\n###La Trobe introduces monthly mining tax as protests begin\n###First gold commissioner arrives in Ballarat\n###Bendigo Petition and the Red Ribbon Movement\n###Legislative Council calls for Commission of Inquiry\n###Hotham replaces La Trobe\n#Tensions escalate\n##Murder of James Scobie and the burning of the Eureka hotel\n##Ballarat Reform League meetings\n##Escalating violence as military convoy looted\n#Open rebellion\n##Paramilitary mobilisation and swearing allegiance to the Southern Cross\n###Fortification of the Eureka lead\n####Vinegar Hill blunder: Irish dimension factors in dwindling numbers at stockade\n####Departing detachment of Independent Californian Rangers leaves small garrison behind\n##Battle of the Eureka Stockade\n#Aftermath\n##Trials for sedition and high treason\n##Commission of Inquiry report\n##Peter Lalor enters parliament\n#Location of Bakery Hill and the Eureka Stockade\n#Political legacy\n#Commemoration\n##19th century\n##20th century\n##21st century\n#Popular culture\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Born in 1991 in Russia, Sorokin moved to Germany with her family at a young age and later relocated to the United States, where she began building a reputation as a high-society socialite.\n\n#Early life\n------------\n\nAnna Sorokin was born in 1991 in Russia. Her family moved to Germany when she was a child, and she spent her formative years in the country. In 2005, Sorokin's family relocated to the United States, settling in Manhattan, New York. Sorokin's mother worked as a housekeeper, while her father was an engineer. Sorokin attended the German International School of New York and later enrolled at Bard College, where she studied psychology and economics.\n\nSorokin's early life was marked by a sense of luxury and privilege. Her family struggled financially, but Sorokin's parents encouraged her to present herself as a high-society socialite. She adopted the alias \"Anna Delvey\" and began to build a persona as a wealthy heiress. Sorokin's online presence was filled with photos of her traveling to exotic locations, attending high-end events, and posing with celebrities and influencers.\n\n#Fraud\n---------\n\nSorokin's life as a con artist began to take shape in 2013, when she started using her fake identity to scam her way into luxury hotels, restaurants, and social clubs. She would often pose as a wealthy heiress, using her charm and good looks to convince establishments to provide her with exclusive services and amenities. Sorokin would then rack up huge tabs on credit cards, expecting her victims to foot the bill.\n\nSorokin's schemes often involved convincing her victims to invest in fake business ventures or to provide her with loans. She would promise them high returns on their investments, but in reality, she had no intention of repaying them. Sorokin's schemes were often elaborate and convincing, and she was able to fool many people into believing she was a wealthy and influential socialite.\n\n#Indictment and arrest\n----------------------\n\nIn 2017, Sorokin's schemes began to unravel. She was indicted on multiple counts of grand larceny and theft of services. Sorokin was arrested in January 2018 and held on $200,000 bail. She was later released on bail and ordered to wear an ankle monitor.\n\nSorokin's indictment was a major blow to her reputation, and she was widely condemned by the public and the media. Her arrest marked the beginning of the end of her life as a high-society socialite.\n\n#Trial, conviction, and sentence\n--------------------------------\n\nSorokin's trial began in May 2019 and lasted for several weeks. She was accused of scamming multiple people out of hundreds of thousands of dollars. Sorokin's defense team argued that she was a victim of circumstance and that she had been manipulated by her victims.\n\nIn January 2020, Sorokin was convicted on multiple counts of grand larceny and theft of services. She was sentenced to 4-12 years in prison and ordered to pay $199,000 in restitution.

This can occur due to various reasons, including respiratory or cardiac problems, high altitude, or poisoning.\n\n# Classification\n\nHypoxia can be classified in several ways, including by cause, extent, and affected tissues and organs.\n\n## By cause\n\nHypoxia can be caused by various factors, including:\n\n* Ischemia: A reduction in blood flow to a particular area of the body, resulting in a decrease in oxygen delivery.\n* Hypoxemic hypoxia: A condition in which the body's tissues and organs are not receiving enough oxygen due to a problem with the respiratory system.\n* Anemia: A condition in which the body's red blood cells are not able to carry enough oxygen to the body's tissues and organs.\n* Histotoxic hypoxia: A condition in which the body's tissues and organs are unable to utilize oxygen due to a problem with the metabolic process.\n\n## By extent\n\nHypoxia can be classified as generalized or localized.\n\n### Generalized hypoxia\n\nGeneralized hypoxia refers to a condition in which the entire body is affected by a lack of oxygen. This can occur due to a variety of reasons, including respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, or severe anemia.\n\n### Localized hypoxia\n\nLocalized hypoxia refers to a condition in which a specific area of the body is affected by a lack of oxygen. This can occur due to a variety of reasons, including ischemia, trauma, or infection.\n\n## By affected tissues and organs\n\nHypoxia can affect various tissues and organs in the body, including:\n\n#### Cerebral hypoxia\n\nCerebral hypoxia refers to a condition in which the brain is not receiving enough oxygen. This can occur due to a variety of reasons, including stroke, cardiac arrest, or traumatic brain injury.\n\n#### Corneal hypoxia\n\nCorneal hypoxia refers to a condition in which the cornea of the eye is not receiving enough oxygen. This can occur due to a variety of reasons, including wearing contact lenses or having a corneal injury.\n\n#### Intrauterine hypoxia\n\nIntrauterine hypoxia refers to a condition in which the fetus is not receiving enough oxygen while in the womb. This can occur due to a variety of reasons, including placental insufficiency or maternal anemia.\n\n#### Tumor hypoxia\n\nTumor hypoxia refers to a condition in which the tumor cells are not receiving enough oxygen. This can occur due to a variety of reasons, including rapid tumor growth or poor vascularization.\n\n#### Vestibular system\n\nHypoxia can also affect the vestibular system, which is responsible for balance and equilibrium. This can occur due to a variety of reasons, including stroke or traumatic brain injury.\n\n# Signs and symptoms\n\nThe signs and symptoms of hypoxia can vary depending on the severity and duration of the condition. Some common signs and symptoms of hypoxia include:\n\n* Shortness of breath\n* Fatigue\n* Dizziness or lightheadedness\n* Confusion or disorientation\n* Headache\n* Chest pain or tightness\n* Pale or blue-tinged skin\n\n## Complications\n\nHypoxia can lead to a variety of complications, including:\n\n* Respiratory failure\n* Cardiac arrest\n* Brain damage or stroke\n* Kidney damage or failure\n* Multi-organ failure\n\n# Causes\n\nHypoxia can be caused by a variety of factors, including:\n\n## Ischemia\n\nIschemia refers to a reduction in blood flow to a particular area of the body. This can occur due to a variety of reasons, including cardiac arrest, stroke, or traumatic injury.\n\n## Hypoxemic hypoxia\n\nHypoxemic hypoxia refers to a condition in which the body's tissues and organs are not receiving enough oxygen due to a problem with the respiratory system.\n\n### Carbon monoxide poisoning\n\nCarbon monoxide poisoning occurs when carbon monoxide binds to hemoglobin in the blood, reducing the amount of oxygen that can be carried to the body's tissues and organs.\n\n### Altitude\n\nAltitude can cause hypoxia due to the lower air pressure at high elevations. This can occur in mountainous regions or during air travel.\n\n### Hypoxic breathing gases\n\nHypoxic breathing gases refer to gases that contain a lower concentration of oxygen than normal air. This can occur in environments such as scuba diving or in industrial settings.\n\n### Other\n\nOther causes of hypoxia include anemia, histotoxic hypoxia, and respiratory depression.\n\n# Mechanism\n\nThe mechanism of hypoxia involves a variety of physiological and pathological responses.\n\n## Physiological responses\n\nPhysiological responses to hypoxia include:\n\n* Increased heart rate and blood pressure\n* Increased respiration rate\n* Increased metabolic rate\n* Increased release of hormones such as epinephrine and norepinephrine\n\n## Acute\n\nAcute hypoxia occurs when the body's tissues and organs are suddenly deprived of oxygen. This can occur due to a variety of reasons, including cardiac arrest or traumatic injury.\n\n## Chronic\n\nChronic hypoxia occurs when the body's tissues and organs are chronically deprived of oxygen. This can occur due to a variety of reasons, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or chronic kidney disease.\n\n## Pathological responses\n\nPathological responses to hypoxia include:\n\n* Cerebral ischemia: A condition in which the brain is not receiving enough oxygen.\n* Myocardial ischemia: A condition in which the heart is not receiving enough oxygen.\n* Tumor angiogenesis: A condition in which tumors are able to grow and metastasize due to an increase in blood vessel formation.\n\n# Diagnosis\n\nDiagnosis of hypoxia involves a variety of tests and physical examination.\n\n## Physical examination and history\n\nPhysical examination and history taking are essential in diagnosing hypoxia. This includes assessing the patient's respiratory and cardiovascular status, as well as taking a thorough medical and social history.\n\n## Tests\n\nTests used to diagnose hypoxia include:\n\n* Pulse oximetry: A non-invasive test that measures the oxygen saturation of hemoglobin in the blood.\n* Arterial blood gas (ABG): A test that measures the pH, oxygen, and carbon dioxide levels in the blood.\n* Chest X-ray: A test that takes images of the lungs and chest cavity.\n* Electrocardiogram (ECG): A test that measures the electrical activity of the heart.\n\n## Differential diagnosis\n\nDifferential diagnosis involves ruling out other conditions that may cause similar symptoms, such as respiratory depression or cardiac arrest.\n\n# Prevention\n\nPrevention of hypoxia involves a variety of measures, including:\n\n## Prevention of altitude induced hypoxia\n\nPrevention of altitude-induced hypoxia involves acclimatization, which is the process of gradually adjusting to higher elevations. This can be achieved by ascending gradually, staying hydrated, and avoiding strenuous activity.\n\n# Treatment and management\n\nTreatment and management of hypoxia involves a variety of measures, including:\n\n## Treatment of acute and chronic cases\n\nTreatment of acute and chronic cases of hypoxia involves addressing the underlying cause of the condition, as well as providing supportive care such as oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation.\n\n# Outcomes\n\nThe outcomes of hypoxia can vary depending on the severity and duration of the condition. In some cases, hypoxia can lead to significant morbidity and mortality, while in other cases, it may be temporary and reversible.\n\n# Epidemiology\n\nEpidemiology of hypoxia involves studying the distribution and frequency of the condition in different populations.\n\n## Silent hypoxia\n\nSilent hypoxia refers to a condition in which the body's tissues and organs are not receiving enough oxygen, but there are no visible or audible symptoms. This can occur due to a variety of reasons, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or chronic kidney disease.\n\n# History\n\nHistory of hypoxia involves studying the concept of hypoxia and its understanding over time.\n\n## Etymology\n\nThe term \"hypoxia\" comes from the Greek words \"hypo,\" meaning \"under,\" and \"oxys,\" meaning \"sharp\" or \"acidic.\" This refers to a condition in which the body's tissues and organs are not receiving enough oxygen.\n\n# See also\n\nSee also hypoxia in other contexts, such as:\n\n* Hypoxia in medicine\n* Hypoxia in biology\n* Hypoxia in physics\n* Hypoxia in chemistry\n\n# Notes\n\nNote: This article is intended for informational purposes only and should not be used as a substitute for professional medical advice or treatment.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Hypoxia_(medicine)\" following this outline:\n\n#Classification\n##By cause\n##By extent\n###Generalized hypoxia\n###Localized hypoxia\n###By affected tissues and organs\n####Cerebral hypoxia\n####Corneal hypoxia\n####Intrauterine hypoxia\n####Tumor hypoxia\n####Vestibular system\n#Signs and symptoms\n##Complications\n#Causes\n##Ischemia\n##Hypoxemic hypoxia\n###Carbon monoxide poisoning\n###Altitude\n###Hypoxic breathing gases\n###Other\n##Anemia\n##Histotoxic hypoxia\n#Mechanism\n##Physiological responses\n##Acute\n##Chronic\n##Pathological responses\n###Cerebral ischemia\n###Myocardial ischemia\n###Tumor angiogenesis\n#Diagnosis\n##Physical examination and history\n##Tests\n##Differential diagnosis\n#Prevention\n##Prevention of altitude induced hypoxia\n#Treatment and management\n##Treatment of acute and chronic cases\n#Outcomes\n#Epidemiology\n##Silent hypoxia\n#History\n##Etymology\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The film is a live-action adaptation of the 1881 children's novel of the same name by Carlo Collodi, which was previously adapted into the 1940 animated film Pinocchio by Walt Disney Productions. The film stars Tom Hanks as Geppetto, a poor woodcarver who creates a puppet boy named Pinocchio, and Benjamin Evan Ainsworth as the voice of Pinocchio.\n\n# Plot\n\nThe story follows Geppetto, a poor and elderly woodcarver who lives in a small workshop in a seaside town. One day, Geppetto decides to create a puppet boy named Pinocchio from a piece of wood, and to his surprise, the puppet comes to life. However, Pinocchio is mischievous and disobedient, and he often tells lies, which causes his nose to grow longer. Geppetto tries to teach Pinocchio to become a real boy, but Pinocchio's antics and lies cause him to get into trouble.\n\nAs Pinocchio navigates the world, he meets a cricket named Jiminy, who tries to guide him on the right path. However, Pinocchio's desire to become a real boy and his own arrogance lead him to disobey Jiminy's advice and make poor decisions. Meanwhile, Geppetto becomes worried about Pinocchio's safety and sets out to find him, only to be captured by the Blue Fairy, who reveals that Pinocchio must learn to be responsible and truthful in order to become a real boy.\n\n# Cast\n\n* Tom Hanks as Geppetto\n* Benjamin Evan Ainsworth as the voice of Pinocchio\n* Joseph Gordon-Levitt as voice of Jiminy Cricket\n* Lorraine Bracco as voice of Blue Fairy\n* Christine Bolster as voice of Monstro the Whale\n* Luke Evans as voice of Honest John\n* Keegan-Michael Key as voice of Stromboli\n* Tientte Jen as voice of Clara\n* Kyanne Lamaya as voice of Sophia\n* Giannelle Imbrogno as voice of Young Geppetto\n* Jim Cummings as voice of Coachman\n\n# Production\n\n## Development\n\nThe film was in development for several years, with Robert Zemeckis attached to direct and Chris Weitz writing the script. Weitz has said that he drew inspiration from the original novel and the 1940 animated film, and that he wanted to create a more faithful adaptation of the story.\n\n## Casting\n\nTom Hanks was cast as Geppetto, and he was reportedly drawn to the project because of the character's complexity and nuance. Benjamin Evan Ainsworth was cast as the voice of Pinocchio, and he was chosen for his youthful energy and charm.\n\n## Filming\n\nFilming took place from June 2018 to July 2019, primarily in Vancouver, British Columbia. The film's production design was led by Dan Hennah, who has worked on several other films with Zemeckis.\n\n## Visual effects and animation\n\nThe film's visual effects were created by Industrial Light & Magic, and they used a combination of live-action and animation to bring the world of Pinocchio to life.
